    "0": "Zabicipril (Z), a new angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor under development, is a prodrug that has to be deesterified in vivo to the active metabolite, zabiciprilat (ZT), to reach its antihypertensive pharmacological properties. Two radioimmunoassays have been developed for the measurement of both Z and ZT in human plasma. Anti-Z and anti-ZT antibodies were raised in rabbits against their respective lysine analogues conjugated to bovine serum albumin. [3H]Z and [3H]ZT were used as radioligands for the prodrug (Z) and the drug (ZT), respectively. Studies on anti-Z antiserum specificity showed no significant cross-reactivity (< 0.1%) with the active metabolite (ZT); similarly, Z is poorly recognized (0.5%) by the anti-ZT antiserum. Both antisera showed little cross-reaction (2%) with glucuronide metabolites. The sensitivities of the assays were 1 and 0.2 ng/mL for Z and ZT, respectively. Interassay coefficients of variation ranged from 9 to 12% for Z at 2-50 ng/mL and from 8 to 13% for ZT at 0.5-5 ng/mL. These assays were used to investigate the pharmacokinetic profile of both Z and its pharmacologically active metabolite ZT after intravenous infusion of Z in human volunteers.", 
    "1": "This article reports the case of a rapidly severe stenosis of the right renal artery, causing uncontrolled hypertension. After failure of a percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty, which provoked the thrombosis of the vessel, a surgical revascularization was performed after +/- eighteen hours of renal ischemia. Blood pressure, blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine returned to normal values. A dramatic improvement of the right renal function was attested at the hippuran scintigraphy after a dose test of captopril. The results of renographic studies obtained in this clinical case underline the role of the captopril radionuclide test in detection and follow-up after treatment of renovascular hypertension.", 
    "2": "The present study asks whether angiotensin II (ANG II), a potent inhibitor of renal renin synthesis and release, regulates renal angiotensinogen synthesis. ANG II (or vehicle) was intravenously infused into male Sprague-Dawley rats for 3 days (vehicle or 100, 300, and 1,000 ng.kg-1 x min-1, n = 8/group), significantly increasing mean plasma ANG II concentrations and raising mean arterial blood pressure (MAP). ANG II dose dependently suppressed plasma renin concentration, kidney renin concentration, and renal renin mRNA levels. In contrast, ANG II infusion increased renal angiotensinogen mRNA levels stepwise to 122, 136 (P < 0.05), and 150% (P < 0.05) of control and also increased both liver mRNA levels (P < 0.05) and plasma angiotensinogen concentration (P < 0.05). Three days of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (10 mg.kg-1 x day-1 quinapril in drinking water, n = 8) significantly decreased MAP (P < 0.05) and increased both mean plasma renin concentration (P < 0.05) and renal renin mRNA levels (P < 0.005). Plasma ANG II concentration tended to decrease (not significant), and neither renal nor hepatic angiotensinogen mRNA levels displayed significant difference. However, when data from ANG II-infused and quinapril-treated rats were analyzed together, correlation between plasma ANG II concentrations and renal angiotensinogen mRNA levels was highly significant (P < 0.005, r = 0.585). Thus plasma ANG II upregulates renal angiotensinogen gene expression and downregulates renal renin gene expression, a reciprocal feedback regulation that may have important physiological consequences.", 
    "3": "Microalbuminuria can be present in 10% to 40% of patients with essential hypertension and is associated with an increased incidence of cardiovascular events. The effect of commonly used antihypertensive agents on urinary albumin excretion (UAE) has not been well established. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a converting enzyme inhibitor, a calcium channel blocker, a beta blocker, and a diuretic on UAE and on creatinine clearance in patients with mild to moderate hypertension.", 
    "4": "We prospectively measured UAE prior to and 4 and 8 weeks after treatment with enalapril, nitrendipine, atenolol, or a diuretic in 48 patients with essential hypertension and microalbuminuria.", 
    "5": "All these agents were equally effective in reducing arterial pressure. However, enalapril but not the other agents significantly decreased UAE.", 
    "6": "Eight weeks of therapy with enalapril may reduce UAE in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension, whereas other agents, such as nitrendipine, atenolol, or diuretics, had no measurable effect on UAE. The clinical and prognostic significance of these observations remains to be established.", 
    "7": "It is unknown if the antiproteinuric effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reflects attenuation in the rate of progression of diabetic nephropathy. We report the results of a randomized, double-blind clinical trial designed to evaluate the longitudinal (18-month) effect of the ACE inhibitor, enalapril (5 to 40 mg/d), versus a placebo on 24-hour urinary protein excretion and on the rate of progression of renal disease in 33 patients with clinical diabetic nephropathy. Systemic blood pressure was controlled throughout the trial with conventional antihypertensive drugs. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), determined by Tc99mDTPA renal clearance, and urinary protein excretion were monitored at 3-month intervals. Enalapril, in contrast to placebo therapy, was associated with an initial (40%) and sustained (33%) decrease in urinary protein excretion. Patients randomized to both enalapril or placebo experienced mean decreases in GFR, from 1.01 mL/s/1.73 m2 (61 mL/min/1.73 m2) to 0.85 mL/s/1.73 m2 (51 mL/min/1.73 m2), and from 1.06 mL/s/1.73 m2 (64 mL/min/1.73 m2) to 0.97 mL/s/1.73 m2 (58 mL/min/1.73 m2), respectively. Eleven of 18 patients (61%) randomized to enalapril, and 10 of 15 (66%) patients randomized to placebo, had a decrease in GFR; their rates of progression were -1.18 mL/min/1.73 m2/mo and -1.00 mL/min/1.73 m2/mo, respectively. In the absence of changes in blood pressure, the addition of an ACE inhibitor to patients with clinical diabetic nephropathy could not be shown to confer a unique renal protective effect. A prolonged decrease in 24-hour protein excretion could not be shown to predict attenuation in the progression of established clinical diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "8": "A 25 mg intravenous bolus injection of captopril caused an abrupt and rapid decrease in systemic vascular resistance (time to maximum effect 15 minutes), but a more gradual decrease in right atrial pressure (time to maximum effect 75 minutes) in 12 patients with chronic cardiac failure. Plasma angiotensin II concentrations fell significantly, reaching their lowest concentrations at 75 minutes after the injection of captopril, at which time systemic vascular resistance had begun to return toward control values. There was no correlation between the acute arteriodilator response and pretreatment plasma renin activity or plasma angiotensin II concentrations, or the decrease in plasma angiotensin II concentrations. There was a significant correlation between the decrease in plasma angiotensin II concentrations and the decrease in right atrial pressure (r = 0.67, p < 0.05). These findings suggest that in contrast to the venous response to intravenous captopril, the arterial response is not entirely dependent on a decrease in the circulating plasma angiotensin II concentration.", 
    "9": "The purpose of this study was to clarify the selectivity and specificity of noninvasive procedures for diagnosis of clinically suspected posttransplant renovascular hypertension. We prospectively investigated 25 renal transplant recipients with arterial hypertension and clinically suspected stenosis of the graft artery (8 female and 17 male patients; ages 45 +/- 15 years). We performed a captopril test with 25 mg captopril (n = 25), renography with technetium-99m diethylene triamine penta-acetic acid (99mTc-DTPA) before and after angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition with determination of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) (n = 23) and color-coded duplex ultrasonography of the transplant kidney vessels (n = 24). Renal transplant artery stenosis (RTAS) was excluded by renal arteriography in 20 patients and by operative evaluation or clinical follow-up in 5 patients. We identified 4 patients with RTAS and renovascular hypertension. The noninvasive methods showed the following results (sensitivity/specificity): (1) captopril test: 75%/67%; (2) renography combined with ACE-inhibition: 75%/84%; and (3) color-coded duplex ultrasonography: 100%/75%. We conclude that in patients with clinical evidence of RTAS most noninvasive diagnostic procedures are not sufficiently accurate to exclude the diagnosis. Only color-coded duplex ultrasonography did not fail to detect all patients with RTAS and may act as a screening test. Intraarterial renal angiography remains the most reliable and as-yet indispensable diagnostic test for transplant recipients to rule out RTAS.", 
    "10": "This study evaluates the prognostic value of captopril renal scintigraphy in hypertensive patients undergoing renal artery revascularization. Preoperative studies of 51 patients were correlated with blood pressure results at 6- and 12-mo follow-up. Captopril-renal scintigraphy was carried out 1 hr after oral administration of 50 mg of captopril, using either 220 MBq of 99mTc-DTPA or 74 MBq of 99mTc-MAG3, followed by a baseline study in case of abnormal results. Evidence of amelioration or normalization in relation to captopril study was considered predictive of blood pressure control following treatment. Blood pressure response was favorable in 37 patients, but failed to show any improvement in 14. The scintigraphic test was positive in 33 patients (15 cured, 17 improved, 1 failed) and negative in 18 (3 cured, 2 improved, 13 failed). Sensitivity and specificity for renovascular hypertension was 86.5% and 93%, respectively. For blood pressure cure and improvement, the test had positive and negative predictive values of 97% and 72%, respectively. A positive preoperative captopril renal scintigraphic result is a strong predictor of hypertension curability by renal artery revascularization.", 
    "11": "Dahl salt-sensitive (S) rats fed a high salt diet develop hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and progressive renal disease. Previous studies have suggested that lipids may be important in the pathogenesis of glomerulosclerosis in Dahl S rats. To investigate this possibility, Dahl S rats fed 4% NaCl chow were treated chronically with the cholesterol synthesis inhibitor lovastatin. After 22 weeks, lovastatin-treated rats had a 38% reduction in serum cholesterol, a 76% reduction in urine albumin excretion, and one-sixth the incidence of focal glomerulosclerosis compared with vehicle-treated control rats. Blood pressure in lovastatin-treated rats was significantly (p < 0.05) lower than that in vehicle-treated rats both early in the study (4 weeks of treatment) and at the end of the protocol. Lovastatin had no effect on glomerular filtration rate or glomerular ultrafiltration dynamics. The efficacy of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in attenuating proteinuria and experimental glomerular disease may be dependent on sodium intake. Thus, we also investigated the effects of long-term enalapril treatment on glomerular injury in Dahl S rats fed high salt chow. Enalapril treatment (50 or 200 mg/l drinking water) significantly lowered blood pressure in Dahl S rats, but did not significantly affect albuminuria or glomerulosclerosis. Enalapril also had no effect on glomerular hemodynamics. These results suggest that lipids may be important in the development of both glomerular disease and hypertension in Dahl S rats and that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition may not affect the course of renal disease in a setting of high salt intake.", 
    "12": "To assess the pulmonary and systemic hemodynamic effects of oral captopril in patients with connective tissue disease and pulmonary hypertension, we performed right heart catheterization in eight patients with diffuse systemic sclerosis, the CREST syndrome, or mixed connective tissue diseases prior to and immediately following administration of captopril (dose range 12.5 to 50.0 mg, short-term study). Four of these patients underwent repeat right heart catheterization after three to six months of oral captopril therapy (long-term study). In the short-term study, oral captopril produced a significant decrease in mean pulmonary vascular resistance from 6.2 +/- 3.6 to 4.6 +/- 3.8 units (p < 0.01). This was accompanied by a significant decrease in mean pulmonary artery pressure, mean blood pressure, mean systemic vascular resistance and a significant increase in cardiac output. Similar changes in pulmonary hemodynamics were noted in the long-term study. Thus, oral captopril is capable of producing an acute and sustained reduction in pulmonary vascular resistance in patients with pulmonary hypertension associated with the aforementioned connective tissue diseases.", 
    "13": "Both captopril renal scintigraphy (CRS) and conventional arteriography were retrospectively evaluated in 64 patients to study CRS efficacy in hypertensive patients with multiple renal arteries (MRA). The presence of MRA was angiographically demonstrated in 9 patients, 7 unilaterally and 2 bilaterally, with a total of 11 kidneys supplied by 2 or more arteries. Overall, 25 MRA were identified and 7 were affected by stenosis of > 50%, causing a reduction of arterial supply in 5 of 11 kidneys. CRS correctly diagnosed all five ischemic kidneys (true positives) and five of six nonischemic kidneys (true negatives); in one case in which perfusion was not reduced, the CRS diagnosis was falsely positive. In the presence of MRA, CRS proved effective in identifying renal artery stenosis of > 50%, involving either one or all the MRA. This study shows that the presence of MRA is not a drawback in the evaluation of renal artery stenosis by means of CRS.", 
    "14": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are a widely used antihypertensive modality. While they have a favorable side effect profile, there is a .1% to .2% incidence of potentially life threatening angioedema. The edema usually presents in the head and neck, especially the face, lips, tongue, and glottis. Patients may initially be treated with standard anti-allergic therapy; however, the situation may dictate a more aggressive therapeutic approach. The authors present the case of a patient who presented with angioedema 18 times over a 3-year period to qualified emergency physicians before the correct diagnosis of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced angioedema was made. Despite recent literature on the subject, there appears to be a lack of familiarization among emergency department physicians regarding this relatively common adverse effect.", 
    "15": "During reperfusion of previously ischemic cardiac tissue, oxygen-centered free radicals are generated and may result in peroxidative injury of cardiovascular cells and membranes. Since the occurrence of reperfusion injury in patients is unpredictable, particularly in those patients with chronic ischemic coronary artery disease, silent ischemia and those predisposed to significant coronary spasm, it would be advantageous to provide continuing therapy with antioxidant agents.", 
    "16": "Patients leaving the hospital after a myocardial infarction are given a prescription containing several drugs. The purpose of this paper is to determine which of these drugs have a proven value and for which types of patients. Antithrombotic agents (be it acetyl-salicylic acid or antivitamin K drugs) have been shown to be efficient after a myocardial infarction. Beta-blockers are certainly useful, notably in cases with severe necrosis. Conversely, the usefulness of calcium antagonists for secondary prevention has not been demonstrated and indeed, it seems probable that the drugs of this class might be harmful in patients who had severe infarction. There is little divergence concerning the necessity to control the risk factors for coronary atherosclerosis after a myocardial infarction. The evidence is strong concerning giving up smoking; it is intuitive as regards controlling arterial hypertension and more controversial as regards the need for lowering blood cholesterol levels. The systematic prescription of antiarrhythmic agents after myocardial is certainly noxious. Finally, prospects are now opened by the prevention of left ventricular remodelling under treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "17": "In this review, the Authors analyzes the more recent data in the Literature about the major cardiovascular risks in diabetic patients affected by systemic arterial hypertension. The more effective pharmacological and not pharmacological treatment is suggested. Particularly the advantages and more important side-effects of antihypertensive drugs are emphasized.", 
    "18": "Aerobic exercise may prevent hypertension and reduce blood pressure and mortality in hypertensive patients and those at high risk for coronary artery disease. Supervised aerobic exercise at an intensity of 70% to 80% of maximal aerobic capacity is recommended to achieve cardiovascular conditioning and other health benefits. When antihypertensive drug therapy is required, physicians should choose an agent that has favorable secondary effects, including hemodynamic responses to exercise. The most favorable effects are achieved with calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, alpha blockers, and central alpha agonists. The effects of diuretics are less desirable, and beta blockers should be a last choice for hypertensive patients who are physically active.", 
    "19": "Therapeutic drugs are the main cause of postural hypotension, notably in elderly people. This syndrome is harmful as it reduces patients' compliance with treatment and is responsible for severe accidents. Drugs which lower cardiac output by acting on heart rate and cardiac muscle contractility, and drugs which decrease blood volume may produce postural hypotension; diuretics are often responsible for hypovolemia and hypokalaemia. The principal mechanisms involved are interferences of drugs with vegetative blood pressure regulation. They include vasomotor centre depressors (morphine-like compounds, antihypertensive agents, neurosedatives, neuroleptics, antiparkinsonians); ganglioplegics; inhibitors of noradrenaline production (methyldopa, disulfiram) or re-uptake (antidepressants); catecholamine depressors (guanethidine); drugs acting on chromaffin granules (monoamine oxidase inhibitors) and those which inhibit post-synaptic receptors (alpha- and beta-blockers). Drugs which act on vascular smooth muscle tone (nitrites, calcium channel antagonists, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) occasionally cause postural hypotension. To the actions of these drugs must be added endogenous and exogenous factors and notably physiological ageing of the baroceptor reflex; these factors must be taken into account whenever therapeutic drugs are prescribed.", 
    "20": "Two female patients who developed acute renal failure secondary to the use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors for hypertension are presented. None had renal artery stenosis on angiography or duplex doppler ultrasound examination. A 66 year old patient with a single functioning kidney recovered basal renal function; the other patient, aged 77 years, remained with a permanent severe renal damage. Risk factors were advanced age, mild chronic renal failure due to nephrosclerosis and diuretic use. We conclude that acute renal failure related to ACE inhibitors may be severe and can occur even in patients without renal artery stenosis. Diuretics, associated to ACE inhibitors, should be prescribed with caution, specially in older hypertensive patients with pre-existing chronic renal failure. Diabetic patients are at special risk due to the high incidence of small vessel disease in them.", 
    "21": "A double blind crossover trial was performed on the effect of enalapril on urinary albumin excretion (UAE) in normotensive insulin dependent diabetics. Nineteen normoalbuminuric (UAE < 30 mg/24 h) and 17 microalbuminuric patients (UAE > 30 and < 300 mg/4 h) were studied; all patients had post prandial blood glucose levels < 180 mg/dl, HbA1 < 11% and none had chronic diabetic complications. Both groups had similar age, years of diabetes, body mass index and protein ingestion (70 g/day). Fifty percent of patients in each group received 5 mg/day of enalapril or placebo during one year, and during the second year the therapy was switched. No changes were observed in blood pressure, post prandial blood glucose, HbA1 and plasma electrolytes during the study period. A reduction in creatinine clearance, within normal limits, in both groups of patients treated with enalapril and no modifications with placebo were observed. UAE decreased significantly in normo and microalbuminuric patients initially treated with enalapril from 19 +/- 8 to 8 +/- 2 and from 71 +/- 19 to 39 +/- 12 mg/24 h respectively. These values increased during the placebo period to 23 +/- 6 and 47 +/- 13 mg/24 h respectively. Among those initially treated with placebo, UAE increased only in normoalbuminurics from 19 +/- 7 to 28 +/- 9 mg/24 h. During subsequent treatment with enalapril, UAE decreased in both groups. It is concluded that, in this group of patients, enalapril decreases UAE, possibly preventing the progression to severe forms of diabetic nephropathy.",

The percentile diastolic and mean blood pressure dropped, in average, 12% in C + HCTZ group and in CT varied between 7 (1st and 2nd month) to 11% (3rd month). Without statistical difference, the blood pressure normalization was obtained in 69% of the patients with the association captopril and diuretic and in 50% of the patients in the chlorthalidone group. It was observed a significant reduction of potassium in patients treated with chlorthalidone (4.2 +/- 0.7 to 3.7 +/- 0.4 mEq/L, p < 0.01) that was not observed with the captopril and the thiazide associated.

Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), a dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase which catalyzes the final activation step in the formation of angiotensin II, was identified by radioligand studies in rat heart and lung.

In human left ventricle homogenate we found a density of binding sites of 121 +/- 15 fmol mg-1 protein (n = 4) with an affinity (Kd) of 850 +/- 55 pM, whereas in rat left ventricle the same values were 23 +/- 4 fmol mg-1 protein and 315 +/- 30 pM, (n = 4), respectively. 3.

The lung:heart ratio of ACE binding site density was about 9:1 in man and 100:1 in rat. 4. The binding affinities of 13 ACE inhibitors were evaluated on human heart and lung: the drugs tested showed a wide range of affinities for the ACE binding sites in both tissues, and the affinity for lung was significantly greater than for heart for most of the drugs. 5. The greater potency of some ACE inhibitors in displacing [3H]-ramiprilat in human lung compared with the heart indicates differences between ACE binding sites in these tissues and suggests the possibility of a selective organ-targeted therapeutic approach.",

Video microscopy was employed to visualize rat afferent and efferent arterioles and to measure their responses to blockade of nitric oxide (NO), which has been shown to account for much of the biological action of EDRF. The NO synthesis inhibitor, N omega-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA), elicited vasoconstriction in a concentration-dependent manner, with 1,000 microM L-NNA significantly reducing both afferent (16 +/- 3%) and efferent (13 +/- 1%) diameters. This concentration of L-NNA also blocked the vasodilator response to 10 microM acetylcholine, while responsiveness to sodium nitroprusside was maintained. Vasoconstrictor responses to 1,000 microM L-NNA were attenuated in kidneys from rats pretreated with enalaprilat or losartan, reducing afferent diameter by 7 +/- 1 (n = 8) and 3 +/- 1% (n = 10) of control, respectively. Efferent arteriolar responses to L-NNA were similarly attenuated by losartan. The constrictor response to 10 nM ANG II was not exaggerated by L-NNA, suggesting that ANG II does not stimulate EDRF synthesis. These observations indicate that EDRF is continuously released in a quantity sufficient to affect both afferent and efferent arterioles of juxtamedullary nephrons in vitro. Furthermore, ANG II blockade attenuates the vasoconstriction elicited by L-NNA, suggesting that EDRF interacts with the renin-angiotensin system to control juxtamedullary afferent and efferent arteriolar resistance.",

To gain insight into the renal elimination of enalaprilat, we carried out multiple-indicator dilution experiments in the isolated perfused rat kidney. Kidneys were perfused single pass with an amino acid-supplemented Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing 20% bovine red blood cells and 4% bovine serum albumin, at a flow rate of 0.11 +/- 0.02 (SD) ml.s-1 x g-1. A bolus of 51Cr-labeled red blood cells (vascular red blood cell indicator), 125I-labeled albumin (vascular plasma indicator), L-[14C]glucose (interstitial space indicator), and [3H]-enalaprilat was injected into the renal artery, and timed samples of venous blood (up to 1 min) and urine (up to 10 min) were collected. The data were analyzed using a variable-transit-time, space-distributed model with modifications accounting for glomerular filtration and the observed 14% protein binding of enalaprilat; the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimated from L-glucose clearance was 9.0 +/- 2.9% of total plasma flow. The ratio of renal clearance of unbound enalaprilat to GFR was 1.56 +/- 0.29, indicating both glomerular filtration and net tubular secretion of enalaprilat. Unidirectional influx from plasma to tubular cells exceeded tubular secretion by a factor of 2.2 +/- 0.5. Thus only about one-half of the enalaprilat taken up by the tubular cells was excreted into urine, with the remainder refluxing into the capillary blood stream, indicating bidirectional permeation of enalaprilat across the basolateral tubular membrane.",

Using the substrate antagonist NW-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), we tested whether renal vasoconstriction induced by endothelium-derived relaxing factor synthesis inhibition could be mediated in part by angiotensin II. In 14 control rats, 10 mg/kg body wt L-NAME increased blood pressure from 106 +/- 6 to 126 +/- 6 mm Hg (p < 0.001), increased renal vascular resistance by 74% (from 19.3 +/- 2.6 to 33.6 +/- 2.9 resistance units), and decreased renal blood flow by 34% (from 5.9 +/- 0.5 to 3.9 +/- 0.3 ml.min-1.g kidney wt-1, p < 0.005). When six rats were treated with 10 mg/kg body wt of the angiotensin receptor antagonist DuP 753, L-NAME increased blood pressure from 84 +/- 4 to 106 +/- 4 mm Hg (p < 0.001); however, renal vascular resistance increased by only 27% (from 13 +/- 2 to 17 +/- 3 resistance units, p < 0.01; p < 0.05 different from control value) and renal blood flow was unchanged.

During long-term treatment, captopril and enalapril caused comparable falls of 12-18 mm Hg in blood pressure (p < 0.01 compared with vehicle treatment). There was no change in urine volume or sodium or potassium excretion in vehicle- or captopril-treated heart failure rats; in contrast, enalapril-treated heart failure rats demonstrated 83% and 10% increases in urine volume and daily sodium excretion, respectively, compared with vehicle-treated rats (both p < or = 0.01). No significant changes in blood urea nitrogen or creatinine were observed with either treatment. Enalapril but not captopril elicited a significant decrease in serum and lung ACE activities. Captopril but not enalapril inhibited aortic ACE activity. Both agents caused a comparable inhibition of renal ACE activity. The magnitude of inhibition of renal ACE activity but not serum and vascular (aortic) ACE activities correlated with the long-term blood pressure response. Enalapril but not captopril normalized renal angiotensinogen expression; the magnitude of this effect correlated with the increase in daily urinary sodium excretion (r = -0.43; p < or = 0.005).",

Similar results were obtained with the chelating reagents ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, indicating that the buffer solution plays a relevant role when a particular iron complex is formed with a chelating agent.

Mean blood pressure were significantly decreased at 4 (17%) and 8 (18%) weeks in treated rats vs age-matched control. Structural diameter reductions occurred in large arterioles starting 4 weeks in treated rats, and in small arterioles at 8 weeks. The cross-sectional wall area of large arterioles increased with age in control animal, but not in captopril treated one. Eight weeks of captopril treatment also decreased the cross-sectional wall area in small arterioles. Measured by stereological techniques, small arteriolar density decreased 17% at 4 weeks and 13% at 8 weeks in treated rats.

Many questions remain which require further research in this field, mainly concerning the optimal time of introduction the treatment, the importance of the chemical molecule used, the most appropriate dosage and the influence of associated drug therapy.

    "54": "Renal hemodynamic effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril diacid (30 micrograms/kg, i.v.; n = 8) were examined using laser-Doppler flowmetry in anesthetized dogs. Two laser-Doppler flowmetry probes were applied simultaneously to measure the renal blood flow of the outer and inner cortex. Changes in cortical renal blood flow, obtained by the laser-Doppler flowmetry method, were intimately related to those in total renal blood flow measured with the electromagnetic flow probe during occlusion of the abdominal aorta or after administration of angiotensin II, norepinephrine, acetylcholine or dopamine. Enalapril diacid produced a significant increase in total renal blood flow, despite moderate hypotension. The blood flow of the inner cortex significantly increased by 21% following enalapril diacid, while that of the outer cortex did not. These data indicate that there may be a regional difference in the intrarenal vasodilating effect of enalapril diacid.

MRI examination was performed at the beginning (T0) and after 3 months (T3) of active treatment, by using a Philips Gyroscan S15 superconducting system, operating at 1.5 Tesla. We used a multislice-multiphase spin-echo sequence on the short-axis and transverse plane (TE = 30 ms; TR = 80-90% RR). End-diastolic thickness of interventricular septum (IVST) and lateral wall (LWT) were measured. LVM was calculated according to Simpson's rule. The results were: IVST 12.2 mm +/- 0.7 vs 10.9 mm +/- 0.5 (p < 0.001); LWT 11.5 mm +/- 0.9 vs 10.5 mm +/- 0.9 (p < 0.001); LVM 160 (g/m2) +/- 5.5 vs 138.4 g/m2 +/- 6 (p < 0.001), at T0 and T3, respectively.

    "57": "Ischaemic cardiomyopathy reflects the myocardial dysfunction caused by coronary disease. It results from the association of 1. segmental infarction(s) responsible for ventricular \"remodelling\", i.e. expansion of the necrotic area(s) and hypertrophy-dilatation of the rest of the ventricle, eventually concurring to heart failure; 2. areas which are viable but with a function that is reversibly compromised by severe acute or chronic ischaemia (myocardial sideration or hibernation) affecting mainly the subendocardium. The spontaneous course of cardiomyopathy towards the worst can be arrested by 1. revascularisation of the myocardium at risk by coronary reperfusion performed either as an emergency in case of infarct in the process of formation, or after detection of the viable myocardial areas by isotopic methods; 2. prevention or limitation of ventricular remodelling by coronary reperfusion and improvement of the ventricular load by administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and nitroglycerin. The Survival and Ventricular Enlargement study (SAVE) has been the first to demonstrate the relationship between limitation of ventricular remodelling and improvement of the secondary prognosis of infarction obtained by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.",

Ten-week oral administration of TA-6366 (1 and 5 mg/kg/d) from 4 weeks of age impeded aortic media-thickening together with a rise in blood pressure in SHRs. Concomitantly, aorta weights in both groups were markedly decreased. The higher dose of TA-6366 almost fully suppressed the accelerated tension development induced by K(+)-free medium and decreased total sodium ion content in the aorta. These vascular effects of TA-6366 was more prominent than those of enalapril and captopril at 5 mg/kg/d. The difference in potencies on the above vascular parameters between TA-6366 and these drugs seemed to be mainly related to the difference in their antihypertensive activities. These results suggest that TA-6366 has preventive effects against progression of vascular diseases, particularly atherosclerosis, accompanied with hypertension.",

Of the 115 patients who completed the study, 58 received enalapril and 57 verapamil. The goal of treatment was a systolic blood pressure < 160 mmHg and a reduction of at least 20 mmHg below baseline. The initial daily dose of enalapril was 5 mg, and of verapamil 240 mg. The dosage was titrated upward until the goal blood pressure was achieved. At the end of the titration period, systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly decreased (P < 0.001) in both patient groups. Blood pressure remained significantly decreased (P < 0.001) in both groups during the 8-week maintenance treatment period. There were no significant differences between groups. Two patients in the enalapril group and nine patients in the verapamil group were withdrawn from the study because of adverse effects.

Significant reductions in blood pressure were observed in both treatment groups. The reduction in diastolic blood pressure was significantly greater in the manidipine-treated patients than in the delapril-treated patients; no significant between-groups differences in systolic blood pressure were noted. Heart rate increased significantly in the manidipine group. No changes in serum levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, and high-density and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were noted during or after treatment. In the manidipine group, a small but significant decrease in apolipoprotein (apo) A-I and an increase in lipoprotein(a) were found at 6 months and a significant increase in apo A-II and apo E at 12 months; in the delapril group a significant decrease in apo A-I was found at 6 months.

GROUP 2 received nifedipine, 10 mg capsules t.i.d. also started between days 5 and 7 post MI. GROUP 3 as a control group was treated conventionally, according to the ICCU routine. The treatment was maintained during 12 months. All patients had a second echo-Doppler at the 5th day post MI to confirm the EF criteria.

    "62": "We examined the effects of the selective neutral endopeptidase (NEP) inhibitor SCH32615 on airway responses to rapid intravenous infusions of substance P (SP) and neurokinin A (NKA) and on recovery of administered tachykinins from arterial blood in anesthetized mechanically ventilated guinea pigs. SCH32615, in doses that cause a marked increase in the magnitude of bronchoconstriction induced by infused NKA, had little effect on the changes in pulmonary conductance (GL) or dynamic compliance induced by SP. In animals in which SCH32615 (1 mg/kg) was administered in combination with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril (5.7 mg/kg), the dose of SP required to decrease GL by 50% was fourfold less than in animals that received captopril alone (P < 0.005). SP measured in arterial blood withdrawn within 45 s of intravenous administration of this tachykinin was not different in control and SCH32615-treated animals, whereas captopril caused an approximately threefold increase in SP concentrations (P < 0.005). When SCH32615 and captopril were administered together, significantly more SP was recovered than when captopril or SCH32615 was administered alone (P < 0.0005). Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that both NEP and ACE contribute to the degradation of intravenously infused SP. ACE degradation of SP is sufficient to limit SP-induced bronchoconstriction even in the presence of specific NEP inhibition.", 
    "63": "The first example of mechanism-based inactivation of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is described for N-[N-(cyanoacetyl)-L-phenylalanyl]-L-phenylalanine (compound 1). It is proposed that an ACE-mediated deprotonation of 1 unmasks a ketenimine intermediate, which traps an active-site nucleophile, and hence irreversibly modifies the enzyme. In competition with the inactivation reaction, ACE also hydrolyzes 1 with a partition ratio of 8300 (i.e., kcat/kinact). Since the corresponding keto analogue, N-[(R)-2-benzyl-5-cyano-4-oxopentanyl]-L-phenylalanine (compound 4), does not inactivate the enzyme, it is suggested that the NH in compound 1 is critical for the proper active-site anchoring of the inhibitor for the inactivation process to take place.",

After a washout period of 4 weeks, 42 patients were randomized to receive 2 mg of trandolapril once daily and 20 to receive placebo in a double-blind fashion for 6 weeks. This was followed by a second washout period of 4 weeks. At the end of each period, clinic blood pressure was assessed at 24 hours after the last dose and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure was measured noninvasively, taking blood pressure readings every 15 minutes during the day and every 20 minutes during the night. Two patients were dropped out before any blood pressure evaluation under treatment. Analysis of ambulatory blood pressure was performed in 48 patients who met the criteria for the minimal number of ambulatory blood pressure data (2 values per hour during the day and 1 value per hour in the night). In the trandolapril-treated group (n = 41) clinic systolic/diastolic blood pressures were 159.8 +/- 2.0/102.4 +/- 0.8, 146.8 +/- 2.3/94.8 +/- 1.1, and 155.7 +/- 2.0/99.2 +/- 0.7 mm Hg in the pretreatment, treatment, and post-treatment periods, respectively.

    "65": "In 15 patients with untreated mild to moderate essential hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy, we assessed blood pressure, echocardiographic left ventricular mass index, brachial artery compliance (pulsed doppler flowmetry), and calculated forearm vascular resistance (strain gauge plethysmography) before, during (6 and 12 months) and after (1 month washout period) 1 year of satisfactory (blood pressure < or = 140/90 mm Hg) antihypertensive therapy with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor trandolapril (2.0 mg orally once daily). During the antihypertensive effective treatment, we observed a significant reduction of systolic and diastolic blood pressures, left ventricular mass index, and forearm vascular resistance at both 6 and 12 months. In addition, brachial artery compliance was significantly increased. After washout, systolic (156 +/- 3 mm Hg) and diastolic (102 +/- 1 mm Hg) blood pressures returned to levels comparable to baseline. However, left ventricular mass index (132 +/- 4; p < 0.01) and brachial artery compliance (1.53 +/- 0.01; p < 0.01) were still different from baseline.

    "66": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to prolong life expectancy in patients with congestive heart failure. In order to determine the relative contributions of the different factors involved in this beneficial effect, we investigated in an experimental model of postinfarction cardiac insufficiency in the rat over a 9-12-month period (1) the kinetics of the development of the hemodynamic, biologic, and morphologic alterations that accompany heart failure, and (2) the kinetics of the effects of a new, long-acting ACE inhibitor, trandolapril. Following induction of infarction, systolic blood pressure, left ventricular dP/dt, and end-diastolic pressure were immediately decreased, decreased, and increased, respectively, and these modifications persisted throughout the study. Cardiac index, on the other hand, was only initially and transiently decreased. Cardiac remodeling (left ventricular dilation, myocardial hypertrophy, and fibrosis) occurred as early as 7 days after infarction and worsened throughout the study. Plasma atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) and urinary cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) were also increased. In this model, a 1-year oral treatment with trandolapril resulted in early hemodynamic and biologic beneficial effects (reductions in pre- and afterload, increase in cardiac index, and decrease in plasma ANF), and in a delayed reversal of the infarction-induced cardiac morphologic alterations. Hence, the trandolapril-induced increase in survival rate is due initially to the drug's hemodynamic effects and over the long-term to both its hemodynamic and cardiac morphologic (limitation of remodeling) effects.", 
    "67": "The aim of this study was to determine the morphologic and functional vascular changes occurring following 4 weeks of treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor trandolapril in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) in the established phase of hypertension. At the dosage used, 0.4 mg/kg orally, trandolapril decreased blood pressure of the SHR by 15-18% compared with that of the control animals. Immediately before the end of treatment, the following changes from control values were observed: (1) 9, 11, and 12% reductions for myocardial hypertrophy and the media thickness of the thoracic aorta and femoral arteries, respectively; and (2) an increase in the compliance of the resistance arteries, demonstrated by a shift to the right of the in vitro tension-diameter curves and a significant 22% increase in their normalized internal diameter, while their maximum contractile ability was significantly decreased. Following discontinuation of treatment, blood pressure levels remained significantly lower in the treated versus the control groups for up to 4 weeks after the last administration. At that time measurement of the studied parameters showed: (1) a rapid reversion to control values of the compliance of the resistance vessels; and (2) a slower progression, but in the same direction, in the parameters of cardiac and vascular hypertrophy. Thus, trandolapril, administered for a short period in the adult SHR, was able to reverse the cardiac and vascular morphologic changes present in this model of hypertension. Like the effect on blood pressure, these effects were slowly reversible at the end of treatment, whereas the functional consequences at the resistance artery level seemed to display a more rapid reversibility.", 
    "68": "Trandolapril is a new angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor that has been extensively investigated in vitro, in animals, in normal volunteers, and in hypertensive patients. It has been shown to exert all the effects typical for the class of ACE inhibitors, and has a marked impact on the reversal of structural hypertrophy of the myocardium and the arterial wall. Trandolapril is a prodrug that must be hydrolyzed to its active metabolite, trandolaprilat. This latter compound exhibits a particularly high affinity for converting enzyme, which results in a slow dissociation and one of the longest durations of action of any converting enzyme inhibitor known so far. Trandolapril reduces blood pressure consistently throughout the 24-hour period following intake. Accordingly, trandolapril, more than any other drug of its class, can be considered a true, once-a-day antihypertensive drug.",

When infant rats were pretreated with the mixture of any combination of two peptidase inhibitors, however, the change in both the response and the reflex were not produced at all by enkephalin injection, indicating that 3 kinds of enzymes, amastatin-sensitive aminopeptidase(s), captopril-sensitive peptidyl dipeptidase A and phosphoramidon-sensitive endopeptidase 24.11, played an important role in the inactivation of enkephalin after its systemic administration. Additionally, the fact that the two enkephalin-induced effects were more effectively antagonized by naloxone, a relatively selective mu-opioid antagonist, than by naltrindole, a specific delta-antagonist, or by nor-binaltorphimine, a specific kappa-antagonist, showed that these two effects were produced by the interaction of enkephalin with mu receptors. Moreover the involvement of mu receptors in the production of these two effects was shown by the fact that the s.c. administration of [D-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4,Gly5-ol]-enkephalin, a selective mu agonist, also produced these two effects which were more effectively antagonized by naloxone than by naltrindole or nor-binaltorphimine. Since the magnitude of the two effects induced by enkephalins in 15-day-old rats was significantly lower than that in 10-day-old rats, and the two enkephalin-induced effects were not produced at all in 20-day-old rats, a maturation-induced decrease in the permeability of the blood-brain barrier against opioid peptides was indicated.", 
    "77": "A phosphonamide peptide, N-(phenylethylphosphonyl)-Gly-L-Pro-L-aminohexanoic acid, previously shown to block Clostridium histolyticum collagenases, was examined as a putative inhibitor of endopeptidase 24.16 and endopeptidase 24.15. Hydrolysis of two endopeptidase 24.16 substrates, i.e. 3-carboxy-7-methoxycoumarin (Mcc)-Pro-Leu-Gly-Pro-D-Lys-dinitrophenyl (Dnp) and neurotensin, were completely and dose-dependently inhibited by the phosphonamide inhibitor with KI values of 0.3 and 0.9 nM respectively. In addition, the phosphonamide peptide inhibited the hydrolysis of benzoyl (Bz)-Gly-Ala-Ala-Phe-(pAB) p-aminobenzoate and neurotensin by endopeptidase 24.15 with about a 10-fold lower potency (KI values of 5 and 7.5 nM respectively). The selectivity of this inhibitor towards several exo- and endo-peptidases belonging to the zinc-containing metallopeptidase family established that a 1 microM concentration of this inhibitor was unable to affect leucine aminopeptidase, carboxypeptidase A, angiotensin-converting enzyme and endopeptidase 24.11. The present paper therefore reports on the first hydrophilic highly potent endopeptidase 24.16 inhibitor and describes the most potent inhibitory agent directed towards endopeptidase 24.15 developed to date. These tools should allow one to assess the contribution of endopeptidase 24.16 and endopeptidase 24.15 to the physiological inactivation of neurotensin as well as other neuropeptides.", 
    "78": "Captopril, the competitive inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme, has proved efficient in the treatment of arterial hypertension and heart failure. Its use is generally associated with low incidence of adverse reactions and hepatic injury has not been emphasized as an important adverse reaction in Denmark. However worldwide, several cases of hepatic injury have been reported. We report one case of Captopril-induced hepatic injury. Despite discontinuation of Captopril a hepatorenal syndrome developed and the patient died five weeks after admission. This report emphasizes the need to be aware of the possibility of hepatic injury in patients receiving Captopril.", 
    "79": "The kidneys of nine fetuses whose mothers were chronically hypertensive were examined microscopically. Three of these mothers used antihypertensive agents throughout pregnancy including one who used an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. The tubular defects found in these kidneys were compared to the kidneys of 20 normal controls, 13 fetuses with various multiple malformation syndromes and six cases of the twin to twin transfusion syndrome. Evidence from these cases as well as the literature suggest that the primary mechanism by which ACE inhibitors affect development of the fetal kidney is through decreased renal blood flow.", 
    "80": "In patients with chronic heart failure, the increase in blood flow to working muscle is attenuated and oxygen consumption is lower for any given workload of exercise, compared with normal subjects. This impaired metabolic vasodilation during exercise cannot be restored with short-term administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. However, long-term ACE inhibition increases blood flow to skeletal muscle, and this increase is closely correlated with improvement in systemic oxygen consumption. The delayed effect of ACE inhibitors may be related to an interference with the vascular tissue renin-angiotensin system and remodeling of the vascular wall. In addition, endothelial-dependent dilation in response to acetylcholine is blunted in the forearm of patients with chronic heart failure, indicating an impaired endothelial function in this setting. There is experimental evidence that long-term ACE inhibition improves endothelial dysfunction; thus, one might speculate that the beneficial long-term effect of ACE inhibitors on peripheral flow may be, in part, related to its ability to restore normal endothelial function. Vasodilators such as hydralazine that improve blood flow to working muscle after acute administration do not increase skeletal muscle oxygen consumption, indicating that oxygen utilization is not improved. Ultrastructural analysis of skeletal muscle revealed that intrinsic alterations of skeletal muscle exist in patients with chronic heart failure; that is, the oxidative capacity of skeletal muscle is impaired in severe heart failure and contributes to the reduced exercise capacity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "81": "It is well established that clinically significant changes in a number of electrolytes occur in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). Magnesium ions are an essential requirement for many enzyme systems, and evidence is rapidly emerging that magnesium deficiency is a major risk factor for survival of CHF patients. In animal experiments, magnesium has been shown to be involved in several steps of the atherosclerotic process and, although in humans the situation is somewhat more complex, magnesium ions play an extremely important role in CHF and various cardiac arrhythmias. A number of drugs commonly used to treat CHF can significantly affect not only cellular magnesium ion homeostasis, but potassium as well. These include mercurial, thiazide, and loop diuretics. It has also been reported that hypomagnesemia is common in digitalis intoxication. In contrast, a number of agents have been shown to have either a magnesium-conserving effect (potassium-sparing diuretics) or not to affect magnesium ion balance (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors). The clinical consequences of magnesium deficiency include the development of various cardiac arrhythmias, all of which respond well to magnesium treatment. Thus, it is more than apparent that magnesium ion homeostasis is of major importance in CHF. Future studies should address the complex role of magnesium ions in electrolyte imbalance, particularly in relation to heart failure.", 
    "82": "Understanding of heart failure has developed through 3 paradigms involving organ, cell, and gene. The first views heart failure as an abnormality of organ (pump) function leading to salt and water retention and vasoconstriction. Therapy to correct these circulatory abnormalities is well accepted and effective. The second considers heart failure as a disordered cellular function, mainly impaired contraction and relaxation. Efforts to correct the biochemical and biophysical abnormalities responsible for these disorders of myocardial performance have, however, been less successful. Recent emphasis on efforts to improve prognosis as well as symptoms in patients with chronic heart failure demonstrates that it is a lethal disease with problems of survival similar to those in malignancies. The third paradigm of abnormal gene expression, which in the failing heart represents a cardiomyopathy of overload, appears to be a major cause of poor prognosis in these patients. Evidence that the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have important effects on cell growth, as well as on vascular tone, suggests that their ability to prolong survival in patients with heart failure may be due largely to the inhibition of detrimental effects of angiotensin II on cardiac gene expression. Thus, it seems likely that work focused on the third paradigm will uncover specific abnormalities of gene expression that are responsible for poor survival of patients with heart failure. By 2001, I predict that heart failure will be viewed as an abnormality of cell growth and this will lead to the development of therapies to retard, if not reverse, the clinical deterioration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "83": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a major role in the control of blood pressure and cardiovascular homeostasis and is involved in the pathogenesis of a number of cardiovascular disorders. The efficacy of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure has led to the widespread clinical use of ACE inhibitors in primary or secondary prevention of heart disease. The demonstration of the expression of the components of the RAS in several extrarenal tissues, as well as local generation of angiotensin II, has confirmed the existence of a tissue RAS that may serve organ-specific functions and act independently from the plasma RAS. The concept of paracrine/autocrine functions of the local RAS has changed our understanding of the functions of the RAS and suggests that tissue ACE inhibition may be of greater importance than inhibition of circulating ACE in the treatment of congestive heart failure and other cardiovascular disorders. Whereas the circulating endocrine RAS appears to be responsible for mediation of acute effects, the tissue RAS seems to be involved in more chronic situations, such as secondary structural changes of the cardiovascular system, and therefore could contribute to the pathogenesis of hypertension as well as other cardiovascular disorders, such as cardiac hypertrophy, coronary artery disease, and atherosclerosis. Several experimental and clinical findings suggest that reversal of cardiovascular structural changes secondary to cardiovascular disease and enhancement of renal sodium excretion by ACE inhibitors are important long-term antihypertensive actions possibly mediated by inhibition of the tissue RAS.", 
    "84": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has both localized and systemic effects in the pathophysiology of heart failure. These may lead to structural changes in the heart and blood vessels as well as to more disseminated symptomatology, including vasoconstriction and both salt and water retention. In association with other neurohormonal mechanisms, such as the sympathetic nervous system, these latter effects result in an elevated work load for the heart. The increase in neurohormonal activity, seen in some patients with heart failure, may result in a loss of circadian variation in heart rate and blood pressure and deprive the heart of a needed reduction in work load during the night. The suppression of such neurohormonal activity through the use of long-acting angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, such as lisinopril, provides a means of controlling such symptoms. In comparison with short-acting ACE inhibitors, such long-acting suppression of the RAS may have a number of advantages. These include a more sustained increase in exercise duration, improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction, and, speculatively, a better influence on patient mortality.", 
    "85": "Early clinical experience with lisinopril suggested that it was well tolerated in congestive heart failure (CHF). An analysis of data from greater than 1,000 patients treated with lisinopril has been performed to examine the long-term safety of lisinopril in CHF. Of these, 620 have been studied for up to nearly 4 years, and a further 440 have been studied in comparative trials for 3 months. When patients who received lisinopril or placebo for the same period were compared, the proportion of lisinopril patients reporting an adverse event was 44.1% compared with 39.4% on placebo. Over a 4-year period, 205 patients (33.1%) discontinued treatment. About 33% of these died, 33% withdrew due to clinical adverse events, 21 (3.4%) were withdrawn because of adverse laboratory findings, and 56 (9.0%) withdrew for reasons unrelated to treatment. Sixteen patients (2.6%) withdrew because lisinopril was deemed ineffective. The most frequently reported drug-related adverse laboratory findings were increases in blood urea nitrogen, blood urea, serum creatinine, and plasma potassium. There appeared to be no differences in the pattern of adverse events with respect to the race of the patient. Elderly patients and those with the most severe forms of heart failure appeared to be at greater risk for an adverse event. Evaluation of the safety of lisinopril compared with enalapril, captopril, and digoxin in controlled clinical trials shows all the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors to be equally well tolerated with a closely similar range of adverse events, suggesting that the satisfactory safety profile of lisinopril is shared by other drugs of this class.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

After 6 weeks of treatment, digoxin and lisinopril had increased exercise duration by 18 seconds (p = 0.015) and 32 seconds (p = 0.0007), respectively, versus the baseline run-in period. The difference between treatments was not statistically significant (p = 0.1343). After 12 weeks, digoxin and lisinopril had increased exercise duration by 29 seconds and 51 seconds, respectively. The effect of digoxin compared with the baseline value was not significant but that for lisinopril was (p = 0.0027). The difference between treatments approached statistical significance (p = 0.0813). There was no difference between lisinopril and digoxin with regard to their effects on the frequency of ventricular ectopic counts, couplets, or nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. Blood pressures were not significantly different between treatments, although both systolic and diastolic blood pressure were consistently lower in the lisinopril group throughout randomized treatment. The proportions of patients demonstrating an improvement in NYHA grading were similar for both lisinopril and digoxin. Both treatments had similar effects on the symptoms of heart failure. Both drugs appeared to be equally well tolerated with a similar frequency of adverse events reported for both drugs (30% for lisinopril vs 29% for digoxin). Withdrawals from treatment were of a similar frequency for both treatments.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Exercise duration was significantly increased by both angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors after 6 and 12 weeks of treatment compared with their respective baseline values. There was a trend toward a greater increase in exercise duration on lisinopril after 12 weeks, although this did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.0748). There were no significant treatment differences with respect to the effect of the 2 drugs on ventricular ectopic counts, couplets, or nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. Both drugs were equally effective in improving NYHA grading and symptoms. Neither treatment had any significant effect on mean heart rate or mean blood pressures. Both treatments were equally well tolerated. The most commonly reported adverse events on both drugs were cough, dizziness, fall in blood pressure, vertigo, and myocardial infarction.

The drugs were compared with regard to their effects on exercise duration, measured with bicycle ergometry, and on ectopic activity, measured using Holter monitoring. Both drugs significantly increased exercise duration after both 6 and 12 weeks of randomized treatment. Neither ACE inhibitor had any significant impact on the hourly rate of either ventricular ectopic counts or couplets, nor was there any difference between treatments with regard to the proportions of patients in whom ventricular ectopic counts were reduced. Both drugs were well tolerated, with no differences observed between treatments. Potassium, urea, and creatinine levels remained stable for both treatments throughout the study.",

The Second Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvivenza nell'Infarto Miocardico (GISSI-2) trial showed that a large number of patients have either clinical heart failure or severe left ventricular damage on discharge from the hospital, with a large risk of death and poor prospects in terms of quality of life. Additional measures to limit ventricular damage are therefore essential to reducing morbidity. The GISSI-3 study protocol on the effects of lisinopril and nitrates, used alone or in combination, in patients with AMI is described in detail.", 
    "90": "A study was undertaken to examine the effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril on exercise performance in 18 patients with major impairment of left ventricular systolic function. The study was a randomized, double-blind, crossover design, and patients received treatment with either once-daily lisinopril (2.5-10 mg) or placebo for a period of 6 weeks. A total of 15 patients completed the study. Compared with placebo, lisinopril had no significant effect on supine or standing blood pressure or heart rate. Although lisinopril had no effect on exercise duration during a low-intensity exercise protocol, in patients undergoing a high-intensity exercise protocol, there was a trend toward improved exercise time and peak oxygen consumption improved significantly. In addition, treatment with lisinopril resulted in an increase in renal blood flow and a reduction in glomerular filtration rate. Moreover, administration of once-daily lisinopril 10 mg resulted in a decrease in plasma concentrations of angiotensin II, aldosterone, and atrial natriuretic peptide, and an increase in plasma concentrations of active renin.", 
    "91": "Patients with severe heart failure often exhibit signs of an impaired renal function. As judged from serum urea and creatinine concentrations, renal function may deteriorate further after the addition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors to therapy. The beneficial effect of unloading the failing heart by reducing the systemic outflow resistance is opposed by a potentially harmful effect of unloading the kidney by preferentially reducing the outflow resistance of the glomerulus. However, development of functional renal insufficiency is unlikely and is a rare cause for withdrawing ACE inhibitors when certain precautions are considered: (1) The initial dose of the ACE inhibitor has to be reduced with increasing severity of heart failure (the titration period thereafter should be monitored carefully); (2) an increase in serum creatinine not exceeding 30% of the basal value may be taken as evidence for a beneficial action of the drug, which in addition to altering cardiac function alters kidney function (when the increase in serum creatinine is considered to be of clinical significance, it seems wise to reduce the dose of diuretics first--thereby neuroendocrine stimulation can be attenuated and the dependency of renal filtration from angiotensin II-induced efferent vasoconstriction can be reduced); and (3) the coadministration of inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis (e.g., acetylsalicylic acid) appears to be associated with a higher risk of impairing renal function: the decrease in glomerular filtration rate is more marked and the compensatory increase in renal plasma flow following ACE inhibition is no longer observed.", 
    "92": "Catecholamines have been found to be powerful indicators of prognosis in patients with congestive heart failure. However, it is uncertain whether catecholamines are a marker for decreased cardiac performance or part of the pathologic process. Catecholamines, exogenously derived beta-adrenergic stimulants, and drugs that amplify sympathetic responsiveness produce early hemodynamic benefits, but do not appear to provide long-term improvement in terms of symptoms or exercise tolerance, whereas blockade of the beta-adrenoceptor appears to have little early benefit but may improve long-term prognosis. This suggests that in the long term, increased catecholamine levels may be deleterious. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors can modulate circulating catecholamines, and the persistence and degree of ACE inhibition may be important not only in reducing catecholamines, but possibly also in reducing mortality in heart failure. It appears that ACE inhibitors definitely reduce mortality in congestive heart failure. It remains to be documented whether the persistence and degree of ACE inhibition is a factor in this effect, and, thus, comparison of short- with long-acting ACE inhibitors and study of the dosage of ACE inhibitors are of importance. The extent to which modulation of the sympathetic nervous system by ACE inhibitors is an important mechanism in their effect in reducing mortality remains to be established.", 
    "93": "The effects of congestive heart failure (CHF) on drug disposition and elimination are many and varied. Indeed, the pharmacokinetics of many of the drugs used to treat CHF are significantly altered by the patient's underlying condition. Reduced gastric emptying in CHF delays absorption and decreases the peak plasma concentrations of furosemide, bumetanide, and digoxin. Moreover, drugs that have a high hepatic extraction ratio (organic nitrates, morphine, prazosin, and hydralazine) achieve higher than expected plasma concentrations in patients with CHF. In contrast, drugs requiring biotransformation to active forms, e.g., angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors such as enalapril, perindopril, quinapril, and ramipril, generally have lower than expected plasma concentrations. Nevertheless, ACE inhibitors can impair renal function in CHF, leading to an actual increase in plasma concentrations. However, decreases in absorption and first-pass metabolism are often offset by reduced hepatic and renal clearance. The overall absorption of lisinopril may be reduced in some CHF patients; consequently, the onset of effect is delayed but is often more prolonged.", 
    "94": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors probably work by inhibition of tissue-located ACE, and they differ with regard to their relative ability to inhibit ACE in different organs. This apparent tissue selectivity may stem from either differences in tissue bioavailability or from a different affinity for the enzyme. The affinity of the ACE inhibitor for a particular enzyme is not only determined by the structure of the inhibitor, but also by the structure of the enzyme. ACE enzymes from different tissues may be slightly different, and this may have some bearing on the relative affinities of different ACE inhibitors for ACE from different tissues. The duration of inhibition in a particular tissue reflects not only the affinity of that inhibitor for the tissue enzyme, but also reflects the ease or difficulty with which the active ACE inhibitor is released from that tissue. Whether the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors on experimentally induced myocardial infarction and reperfusion arrhythmias are due to the presence of a sulfhydryl group or are mainly related to the ACE inhibitor-mediated bradykinin potentiation remains a matter of controversy.",

    "96": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and calcium antagonists have, by reason of their potentially favourable pharmacological profile, become increasingly established in the treatment of hypertension in recent years. In a double-blind randomized study with an initial placebo phase, carried out by practising physicians and thus aimed at the \"usual\" practice patients with essential hypertension, we assessed (1) the antihypertensive effect and tolerability of an ACE inhibitor (ramipril, 5 mg/d) or a calcium antagonist (nitrendipine, 20 mg/d) given in a single daily dose, and (2) a possible age-dependent blood pressure (BP) effect of these therapies. In the 4 weeks' placebo phase, the two treatment groups were comparable as regards average age (49.6 and 49.4 years), age-range (27-67 and 25-64 years) and BP. Fifty-two patients completed the following 6 weeks' phase with active drug therapy. On ramipril (n = 26), the BP measured 24-25 hours after the last drug administration was reduced in the supine position from an average of 155/102 to 142/91 mmHg (mean reduction -10.1%) and in the upright position from 156/106 to 141/96 mmHg (-9.3%). Nitrendipine (n = 26) reduced the average BP from 155/102 to 147/94 mmHg (-6.8%) and from 155/106 to 146/99 mmHg (-6.6%) respectively. BP-lowering effects of both treatments were largely independent of age. Including the patients who discontinued the study prematurely because of side effects (1 on ramipril, 4 on nitrendipine), the \"intention to treat analysis\" shows BP normalization rates (diastolic < or = 90 mm Hg) of 55% (ramipril) and 30% (nitrendipine) respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "97": "In very old, normotensive rats, a disorganization occurs selectively in the retrosplenial cortex, and a similar disorganization occurs in this area in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) at a much earlier age. Since this breakdown compromises a neural circuit involved in learning and memory, this study tests the hypotheses that these functions are disturbed in mature SHR and that they can be prevented or attenuated by long-term, anti-hypertensive therapy. SHR and Sprague Dawley rats (SD) at 3- and 12 months of age, and a group of SHR that had been normotensive from 3 to 12 months of age (CAP-SHR) were trained on an 8 arm radial maze task. Of the 12-month-old groups, SD reached criterion earliest (28 +/- 2 days) and made the least number of total errors. In comparison, 12-month-old SHR took significantly longer to reach criterion (39 +/- 2 days) and made nearly twice as many total errors. CAP-SHR were intermediate between the other two groups (32 +/- 2 days). Three-month-old SD learned the task at the same rate as the 12-month-old SD. In contrast, 3-month-old SHR learned the task significantly faster (21 +/- 1 days) and with fewer errors than any other group. These data indicate that, in SHR, learning and memory are compromised by 12 months of age, and that anti-hypertensive therapy with captopril partially prevents this decline.",

Following derivatization, the sample solutions were analysed by wide-bore column gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with multiple ion detection. The detection limits of the three metabolites were each 1 ng/ml in plasma and 5 ng/ml in urine. Analysis of the spiked plasma and urine samples demonstrated the good accuracy and precision of the method. This method was very useful for use in pharmacokinetic and bioavailability studies of the three metabolites of imidapril in humans.",

    "101": "To evaluate the secretory regulation of 19-hydroxyandrostenedione (19-OH-AD), its plasma concentration was measured before and after stimulation and inhibition tests for the ACTH-adrenal axis and the renin-angiotensin system in 50 normal subjects. Basal levels of plasma 19-OH-AD did not correlate with either those of plasma renin activity (PRA) or the plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC), but positively correlated with those of plasma cortisol. Plasma 19-OH-AD was stimulated by 0.25 mg ACTH-(1-24) and was suppressed by 1 mg dexamethasone (DEX) as were plasma cortisol and PAC. On the other hand, with 2-h standing alone or iv 40 mg furosemide plus 2-h standing, plasma 19-OH-AD and cortisol did not increase but PRA and PAC did. With iv furosemide plus 2-h standing with 3 mg DEX pretreatment, plasma 19-OH-AD and cortisol did not respond either, but PRA and PAC increased. With 25 mg oral captopril following 1-h standing with 3 mg DEX pretreatment, plasma 19-OH-AD and cortisol did not change but PAC decreased. These results indicate that the secretion of 19-OH-AD is mainly under the control of the ACTH-adrenal axis rather than the renin-angiotensin system.",

The antihypertensive efficacy, haemodynamic and excretional effects of superimposed calcium blockade with isradipine were investigated in seven hypertensives with unsatisfactorally controlled blood pressure with captopril 50 mg twice daily. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal plasma flow (RPF), clearances (C) of sodium (Na), potassium (K), uric acid (UA) and lithium (Li), were measured before and after a low-dose bolus of isradipine, i.v. Subsequently, measurements were repeated during constant i.v. infusion of a higher dose with definite systemic haemodynamic effects. After 4 months of combined treatment with isradipine and captopril renal investigations were carried out again. The low isradipine dose induced a slight but statistically significant increment in CNa (22% +/- 28) and heart rate (4% +/- 4), whereas no other variables changed significantly. Infusion of the high isradipine dose caused a pronounced fall in renal vascular resistance (27% +/- 14), systolic (8% +/- 2) and diastolic blood pressure (17% +/- 5). RPF increased significantly (15% +/- 18) whereas no changes were noted in GFR, filtration fraction and urinary albumin excretion rate. In spite of the pronounced fall in BP during the high dose infusion, significant increments in natriuresis (91% +/- 63) and diuresis (41% +/- 27) were induced.

    "103": "Dry cough is one of the most common side-effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. The mechanism of cough induced by ACE inhibitors is not completely understood and may be related to bronchial hyperreactivity and/or an accumulation of kinins. In a placebo-controlled, double-blind randomised study, the effect of captopril on lung function and bronchial reactivity to histamine and bradykinin was investigated in eight asthmatic and 12 hypertensive patients (six with and six without cough during previous ACE inhibition). Lung function did not change in any patient after a single (25 mg) or short-term (2 x 25 mg for two weeks) administration of captopril. Bronchial reactivity to histamine and bradykinin remained unaltered in all groups. In hypertensive patients with cough, reactivity to histamine tended to be more pronounced and bronchial hyperreactivity to be more frequent than in those without cough. In conclusion, the present results do not support a major role for kinins in cough induced by ACE inhibition. On the other hand, bronchial hyperreactivity may be important in some patients. Additionally, these results demonstrate that treatment with ACE inhibitors is safe in most patients with bronchial asthma.",

The effect on conduit arteries was evaluated through determination of carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity used as an index of arterial distensibility. We compared the dose-response curves of these two parameters in a double-blind study carried out in 24 patients with essential hypertension, who were randomised between placebo and 2, 4 and 8 mg of the converting enzyme inhibitor trandolapril given for 8 days. The antihypertensive effect was observed from 2 mg, at which dose the plateau of BP reduction was already achieved. No significant correlation was found between dose and BP reduction (r = -0.34), whereas the dose was significantly related to the change in pulse wave velocity (r = -0.56, P < 0.01). No significant correlation was found between changes in BP and change of pulse wave velocity. The study provides evidence that the effect on the conduit artery was obtained for higher doses than the BP effect in patients treated for hypertension by the converting enzyme inhibitor trandolapril.",

    "106": "Prospective studies in insulin-dependent diabetic patients have shown that microalbuminuria is a strong predictor of clinical nephropathy. Because this syndrome is associated with a dramatic excess in mortality, different types of intervention have been proposed for insulin-dependent diabetic patients with microalbuminuria to prevent or postpone clinical nephropathy. The effects of antihypertensive treatment are being extensively investigated. Beta-blockers, calcium antagonists, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have proved effective in reducing albumin excretion and postponing overt proteinuria in hypertensive and normotensive insulin-dependent diabetic patients with microalbuminuria. However, many problems remain to be solved. A decrease in albumin excretion may not be an adequate endpoint for intervention trials, because it has been shown that patients with normal albumin excretion can develop diabetic nephropathy lesions, whereas patients with microalbuminuria alone may have little or no pathology. The patients included in these trials all had incipient diabetic nephropathy but exhibited different functional, and probably morphological, forms of the disease. For insulin-dependent diabetic patients with microalbuminuria, the real aim of antihypertensive treatment is not to reduce urinary albumin excretion or to prevent its progression but to preserve renal function and to reduce the incidence of premature cardiovascular deaths. To achieve this, we have to improve our knowledge of the natural history of the early pathology of diabetic nephropathy and of the mechanisms of action of antihypertensive treatment. New large-scale intervention trials will have to be designed in which the patients will have to be carefully characterized on the basis of functional and morphological data.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "107": "The offspring of essential hypertensive parents have been found to exhibit abnormalities in renal hemodynamics and sodium handling before the eventual occurrence of hypertension. The reported abnormalities represent a wide spectrum of changes including increased GFR, normal or decreased RPF, slight increase in blood pressure (although within the normal range), and an exaggerated natriuresis response to a sodium load. The heterogeneity of these abnormalities may reflect the specific conditions of the studies, the lability of the changes, or different subgroups of subjects with genetic predisposition to essential hypertension. Several lines of evidence have suggested a relationship between hypertension and the development of diabetic nephropathy in insulin-dependent diabetics. This laboratory has found that recent-onset insulin-dependent diabetics can exhibit renal hemodynamics abnormalities very early in the course of diabetes according to a positive or negative family history of essential hypertension. These changes include increased GFR and mean arterial pressure, but no differences in renal sodium and lithium handling in diabetics with a genetic predisposition to essential hypertension. In addition, diabetics with a positive family history of essential hypertension exhibited a more-marked vasodilative response to an acute interruption of the renin-angiotensin system, further suggesting inadequate angiotensin modulation of renal vascular tone. The significance of these abnormalities in relation to the development of diabetic nephropathy requires further investigation.", 
    "108": "Studies have demonstrated that \"antihypertensive\" treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) may retard the progress of nephropathy in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. To obtain an indication of the potential effect of ACEI treatment and as a guide to future research, the effects of screening and early ACEI treatment programs were estimated using cost-effectiveness models. The preliminary analysis suggests that the early treatment of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus patients with ACEI is likely to be a very cost-effective use of health care resources. The cost-effectiveness ratio for screening and treatment at the stage of microalbuminuria ($7,900 to $16,500 per year of life saved) compares favorably with those of other medical life-saving interventions. Less-aggressive programs (screening followed by treatment at the stage of proteinuria) would improve life expectancy to a lesser extent but could save net health care costs as well as years of life. Although more exact and comprehensive cost-effectiveness analysis must await clinical trials, these illustrative results demonstrate the range of cost-effectiveness that can be expected from these programs and identify data needed for more decisive policy conclusions.", 
    "109": "We assessed blood pressure and neurohumoral factors at rest and during exercise in 10 patients with essential hypertension before and after treatment with the new angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, alacepril (25-50 mg day-1). Alacepril significantly lowered mean blood pressure at rest and at the same exercise load as before treatment without affecting heart rate response. The response of plasma renin activity, plasma aldosterone, and plasma adrenaline were not changed by alacepril, but increase of plasma angiotensin II and plasma noradrenaline during exercise were significantly attenuated after alacepril treatment (ANOVA, P = 0.04, both). The change in mean blood pressure during exercise was positively correlated with the decrease in plasma angiotensin II (r = 0.65, P < 0.05). These results demonstrated that alacepril was effective in essential hypertension both at rest and during exercise, suggesting that the antihypertensive effect during exercise might be related to the decrease in pressor hormones, especially in plasma angiotensin II.", 
    "110": "The possibility that the ACE inhibitors, enalapril and captopril, may decrease plasma EPO concentrations was studied in a single-blind, cross-over study in 10 healthy volunteers. Plasma EPO concentrations, haemoglobin concentration, red blood cell count, plasma creatinine concentration and mean arterial pressure were measured at baseline and after 28 days treatment with both ACE inhibitors. A significant fall in mean plasma EPO concentration occurred with both ACE inhibitors and returned to baseline after stopping the drugs. It is likely that ACE inhibitors decrease EPO formation, by inhibition of angiotensin-II production. This effect could be important in patients with renal failure, renal transplantation or other chronic conditions with an associated anaemia. Haematological parameters should be monitored in such patients when they are treated with an ACE inhibitor.", 
    "111": "Over the past several years, angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, compounds that block the formation of angiotensin II (ANG II), have become widely used in the treatment of cardiovascular disease. Recently, a new class of orally active, non-peptide inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system, the ANG II receptor antagonists have also become available. Since both classes of compounds block the renin-angiotensin system, although at different sites, it remains to be determined whether blockade of ANG II receptors will have any specific advantage over inhibition of ACE. The following review assesses the actions of ANG II antagonists and suggests ways in which blockade of ANG II receptors may differ both pharmacologically and clinically from inhibition of ACE.", 
    "112": "This review examines selected aspects of the treatment of the nephrotic syndrome in children. Particular attention has been paid to two groups of nephrotic children. First, children with steroid-responsive nephrotic syndrome are discussed. Recently, a series of controlled studies have provided important information regarding the optimal duration of steroid therapy. Initial episodes of the nephrotic syndrome are best treated with \"long\" courses of prednisone therapy (6 wk of high-dose daily prednisone followed by 6 wk of alternate-day prednisone). In contrast, relapses do as well with \"short\" courses (about 2 wk of daily prednisone and 2 wk of alternate-day therapy). Some children who are steroid responsive require high doses of prednisone to remain in remission. These patients may require alkylating agent therapy. The most common cause of steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome is focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Over the past 10 yr, these patients have been treated with an intensive protocol involving multiple infusions of high-dose methylprednisolone and, in many cases, oral alkylating agent therapy. Current experience with this treatment is presented. The protocol appears to improve the outcome in children with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, although it is believed that it is essential that these observations be confirmed by a controlled trial. There is also interest in the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and cyclosporine in the treatment of childhood nephrotic syndrome. The experience with these agents is briefly reviewed, but the current data are inadequate to indicate their role(s) in this condition.", 
    "113": "To compare the effects of enalapril and captopril on blood pressure, serum creatinine (S-Cr), and potassium (S-K) levels, patients with malignant hypertension treated with either 5-10 mg of enalapril (eight cases) or 75-400 mg of captopril (eight cases) were investigated retrospectively. After 2 weeks of treatment, the average blood pressure fell from 214/138 to 132/89 mmHg on enalapril and from 240/145 to 147/95 mmHg on captopril. The percent change in mean blood pressure during the 2 weeks of treatment with enalapril (-35.6 +/- 4.0 SE%) was similar to that with captopril (-35.8 +/- 2.8%). S-Cr did not change in both groups, while S-K increased significantly from 3.9 +/- 0.2 to 5.2 +/- 0.2 mEq/l on enalapril and from 3.6 +/- 0.2 to 4.2 +/- 0.1 mEq/l on captopril. S-K at the second week was significantly higher in the enalapril than in the captopril group. The maximum S-Cr concentration during the treatment was correlated with the corresponding S-K concentration similarly in both groups. These results indicate that both enalapril and captopril increase S-K without deterioration of renal function in patients with malignant hypertension and that the way these drugs are used in clinical practice may be more likely to result in elevated S-K with enalapril.", 
    "114": "Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors have greatly improved the treatment of patients with chronic heart failure but they are not effective in all patients, and their use may be limited by side effects. There is, therefore, a need to investigate new drugs and to compare their efficacy with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Flosequinan is a new direct-acting vasodilator that has been shown to be effective in placebo-controlled studies. Patients with chronic heart failure in NYHA classes II or III who remained symptomatic despite at least 80 mg of frusemide daily were recruited from two centers. Following a single-blind placebo run-in period, the patients were randomized double blind to either the addition of captopril or flosequinan for 6 weeks. Following a further 2-week placebo washout period, they were then given the alternative treatment. Symptom-limited treadmill exercise times, scores of perceived exertion, and corridor walk tests were measured at two weekly intervals during the study. Twenty-five patients entered the study, 16 of whom completed without a change in diuretic dose. Five patients were withdrawn while taking captopril and two while taking flosequinan; two were withdrawn during the placebo washout period. For those patients who completed the study, flosequinan increased treadmill exercise tolerance from a mean (SEM) placebo time of 11.5 (1.0) minutes by 2.4 (0.6) (p = 0.0002) and captopril from 12.0 (0.8) minutes by 1.2 (0.6) minutes (p = 0.08). Comparison of the other measures of efficacy revealed no difference between the groups. In this short-term study flosequinan appeared to be equal in efficacy to captopril.",

    "122": "Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is usually due to monomorphic ventricular tachycardia and/or ventricular fibrillation. However, in the vast majority of patients these arrhythmias are associated with advanced structural disease. In our society, this is usually due to coronary artery disease (CAD). The implantable cardioverter--defibrillator is the logical approach to management in survivors of SCD. Its rational use must be guided by electrophysiology study. However, a realistic and cost-effective approach to the prevention of a first cardiac arrest must be multifaceted and take cognisance of other aspects including primary prevention. Limitation of the size of myocardial infarction (MI) is vital. Trials already suggests that effective thrombolysis may impinge long-term on arrhythmic end-points. Following infarction, ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death may also be decreased by aspirin, beta-blockers, and possibly angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and amiodarone. Many post-infarction studies employ a combined end-point of death and clinical arrhythmias. However, death is usually confined to those with an ejection fraction < 35%. In them, treatment of associated heart failure is often a consideration and if the ejection fraction < 15-20%, depending on donor availability, transplantation may even be the preferred therapeutic option to the cardioverter-defibrillator.", 
    "123": "Despite extensive clinical experience the role of digoxin is still not well defined. In patients with atrial fibrillation digoxin is beneficial for ventricular rate control. For patients in sinus rhythm and heart failure the situation is less clear. Digoxin has a narrow therapeutic:toxic ratio and concentrations are affected by a number of drugs. Also, digoxin has undesirable effects such as increasing peripheral resistance and myocardial demands, and causing arrhythmias. There is a paucity of data from well-designed trials. The trials that are available are generally small with limitations in design and these show variation in patient benefit. More convincing evidence is required showing that digoxin improves symptoms or exercise capacity. Furthermore, no trial has had sufficient power to evaluate mortality. Pooled analysis of the effects of other inotropic drugs shows an excess mortality and there is a possibility that digoxin may increase mortality after myocardial infarction (MI). Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors should be used first as they are safer, do not require blood level monitoring, modify progression of disease, relieve symptoms, improve exercise tolerance and reduce mortality. Caution should be exercised in using digoxin until large mortality trials are completed showing either benefit or harm. Until then digoxin should be considered a third-line therapy.", 
    "124": "In the first few hours after the onset of coronary occlusion the infarct zone stretches due to myocyte slippage. Subsequently the noninfarct zone develops volume overload hypertrophy with series addition of new sarcomeres and fibre elongation. Dilatation is detrimental as it increases ventricular wall stress and oxygen demand, and re-entry of electrical impulses may be influenced by stretching of the ischaemic scar resulting in ventricular fibrillation. Left ventricular remodelling and dilatation is a progressive process which begins early and continues in the months after infarction. The major determinants of the extent of remodelling are infarct size and patency of the infarct-related artery. Late reperfusion may reverse initial infarct dilatation and decrease left ventricular volumes by inducing calcium-activated contracture of the actomyosin complex. Expansion may also be inhibited by acceleration of healing, splinting of the infarct zone by salvage of subepicardial cells, and blood in the coronary arteries and veins supporting the infarct zone. End-systolic volume is the strongest predictor of long-term prognosis after infarction. A number of therapies including thrombolysis, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and nitrates have been shown to decrease left ventricular dilatation. The optimal time for commencement, dose, duration and the effects of combinations of therapy are yet to be determined.", 
    "125": "If the failing left ventricle could be given an effective push, other approaches to the treatment of heart failure would not be needed. We have inotropes only for short-term parenteral use. We have no safe inotrope for chronic oral use. The effect of digitalis is only feeble and the phosphodiesterase inhibitors seem to increase mortality from sudden death. Diuretics are dramatic for acute pulmonary oedema and the mainstay for chronic fluid retention but do not improve the pump and by reducing blood volume stimulate the renin angiotensin system to vasoconstriction, further fluid retention and hypokalaemia. Nitrates drop pre-load without reducing blood volume but tolerance is a problem and stroke volume does not increase. Reduction of afterload helps the failing ventricle to empty, the pull and output increases. The angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) are now the cornerstone of heart failure treatment, reducing mortality in severe heart failure (CONSENSUS) and superior to standard vasodilator therapy (V-HeFT-2) at improving the survival of patients with mild to moderate heart failure. ACEI can reduce the incidence of ventricular ectopy and probably do this through improving left ventricular function, from decreasing sympathetic tone, reducing myocardial oxygen demand or increasing serum potassium but ACEI did not diminish the incidence of sudden death in the SOLVD trial despite reducing mortality. Disappointingly little improvement in exercise tolerance and persistence of chronic fatigue in heart failure concentrated attention on the periphery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "126": "Cardiovascular and renal responses to a step-up infusion of endothelin-1 (ET-1) (1, 5, and 15 ng kg-1 min-1) were investigated in conscious dogs. In addition, the disappearance of ET-1 in arterial and central venous plasma after an infusion of 10 ng kg-1 min-1 was quantified, and the effects of vasopressin (AVP, 10 ng kg-1 min-1) and angiotensin II (AII, 2, 5, and 10 ng kg-1 min-1) on plasma ET-1 were investigated. The step-up infusion of ET-1 increased the plasma level from 3.6 +/- 0.3 to 243 +/- 23 pg ml-1. Concomitantly, arterial blood pressure increased and heart rate (HR) decreased dose-dependently. Diuresis, sodium, and potassium excretion did not change significantly. However, free water clearance increased during the infusion. Clearance of creatinine and excretion of urea decreased (39 +/- 4 to 29 +/- 3 ml min-1 and 87 +/- 16 to 71 +/- 14 mumol min-1, respectively). Decay curves for ET-1 in venous and arterial plasma were identical, and initial t1/2 was 1.1 +/- 0.1 min. Vasopressin increased arterial blood pressure (107 +/- 4 to 136 +/- 3 mmHg) beyond the infusion period and increased plasma ET-1 (85%). An equipressor dose of AII tended to decrease plasma ET-1. It is concluded that the lung is apparently not important in the removal of ET-1, that the disappearance of ET-1 follows a complex pattern, and vasopressin--in contrast to angiotensin II--is able to increase the plasma concentration of ET-1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Eight healthy males performed cycle ergometry at 75% of VO2peak on three occasions after the administration of a placebo (PLACEBO), a prostaglandin inhibitor (indomethacin, INDO), and an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (captopril, CAPTO). Urine and blood samples were collected prior to, immediately following exercise, and over 40-min recovery. Data were evaluated for differences among drug treatments and measurement phases. During PLACEBO, exercise increased total protein excretion from 64.9 +/- 9.5 to 408.6 +/- 160.8 micrograms.min-1 (P < 0.05). PG inhibition with INDO significantly attenuated the increased proteinuria due to exercise (149.2 +/- 64.0 micrograms.min-1). The proteinuric response to exercise was not altered by CAPTO. Resting plasma renin activity (PRA) and aldosterone (ALDO) were significantly reduced during the INDO trial. Although the twofold increment in ALDO with exercise remained intact during the INDO trial, the PRA response to exercise was significantly blunted. No treatment differences were observed for mean arterial pressure, sodium excretion, urine flow, or creatinine clearance values during rest or exercise. These results suggest that the proteinuria associated with steady-state exercise is PG dependent and not related to hemodynamic influences.",

Cilazapril was infused intravenously (25 micrograms/kg per min) into anaesthetized rats, and the arterial blood pressure (BP) and renal clearance of rats were measured. 2. In 1K rats, cilazapril reduced BP from 123 +/- 4 to 117 +/- 4 mmHg (P < 0.05), and produced diuresis, natriuresis and kaliuresis without significantly changing glomerular filtration rate (GFR). 3. In 1K1C rats, cilazapril significantly reduced BP (from 157 +/- 5 to 143 +/- 6 mmHg; P < 0.05), GFR (14.4 +/- 6.7%), urine flow (27.1 +/- 8.5%) and sodium excretion (39.4 +/- 7.4%). Mechanically graded reductions of renal arterial pressure alone also produced parallel decreases in GFR and renal excretory function. 4. In 1KU rats, removal of the renal arterial clip significantly decreased BP and increased renal function. Subsequent infusion of cilazapril further reduced BP and urinary excretions of sodium and water but did not significantly change GFR. 5. These results suggest that the renal function of the 1K1C hypertensive model is pressure-dependent, and that ACE inhibitor exerts a mild antihypertensive effect but causes a pressure associated reduction in renal function.

In 2KGH rats, the number of renin and AII immunoreactive JG cells in the clipped kidneys increased throughout the observation period. The number of renin and AII immunoreactive JG cells in the unclipped kidneys was almost the same as that in control rats, although immunoreactivity of these cells was weak and they were small in size. These changes in the unclipped kidneys became obvious with the time course after operation. We did not see any changes in these cells in SHR. In 2KGH rats treated with captopril, the number of renin immunoreactive JG cells in the clipped kidneys increased, whereas that of AII immunoreactive JG cells in the bilateral kidney decreased. When captopril was administered to SHR, the number of renin immunoreactive JG cells in the bilateral kidney increased, whereas that of AII immunoreactive JG cells in the bilateral kidney decreased. These results suggested that the JG cell in the bilateral kidney was closely related to the development of hypertension in 2KGH rats, but not in SHR. The increase of renin immunoreactive JG cells in 2KGH rats and SHR treated with captopril was probably due to the removal of negative feedback inhibition of AII on JG cells.", 
    "140": "We have examined the hemodynamic effects of intraventricular angiotensins in conscious rabbits. Fourth ventricular injections of angiotensin II (ANG II, 8 fmol to 25 pmol) produced dose-dependent pressor responses at doses 400 times less than equipressor intravenous doses. Lateral ventricle administration of doses up to 1,000 pmol had little effect on mean arterial pressure (maximum +7 +/- 3 mmHg, P < 0.05, n = 9). Comparison of dose-response curves to ANG I, II, and III showed that all three had similar maximum pressor effects (27 +/- 3 mmHg), with ANG I being four times less potent than ANG II, and ANG III as potent as ANG II. Central pretreatment with the ANG-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril abolished the pressor response to ANG I, suggesting that it was mediated entirely through ANG II. Examination of the hemodynamic changes after ANG I, II, and III in rabbits instrumented with aortic, mesenteric, or hindquarter flow probes showed that the rise in blood pressure to all three agents was due entirely to a decrease in total peripheral conductance, since cardiac output and heart rate fell. Peripheral conductance changes were not uniform, with the mesenteric bed showing an average 20 +/- 3% fall in conductance, while the hindquarter conductance increased (+12 +/- 3%). In sinoaortic-denervated rabbits, however, central angiotensins reduced conductance equally in the hindlimb and mesenteric beds, suggesting that the hindlimb dilatation in the baroreceptor intact rabbit was due to baroreflex buffering of the pressor effect. In conclusion, these studies suggest that the main sites for ANG effects on the cardiovascular system are located in the brain stem.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "141": "The intrarenal renin-angiotensin system (RAS) may contribute to the pathophysiology of heart failure by the generation of angiotensin II at local sites within the kidneys. Angiotensin II may directly influence renal hemodynamics, glomerular contractility, and tubular sodium reabsorption, thereby promoting sodium and fluid retention in this syndrome. In the present study, we examined components of the circulating RAS as well as the intrarenal expressions of renin and angiotensinogen mRNA in rats with stable compensated heart failure (HF) 12 wk after experimental myocardial infarction. Renal angiotensinogen mRNA level in vehicle-treated HF rats increased 47%, as compared with sham control rats (P = 0.001). The increase in angiotensinogen mRNA levels was more pronounced in animals with medium (46%, P < 0.05) and large (66%, P < 0.05) infarcts than in those with small infarcts (31%, P = NS). There were no differences in liver angiotensinogen mRNA, circulating angiotensinogen, angiotensin II, plasma renin concentration (PRC), kidney renin content (KRC), and renal renin mRNA level between sham and HFv. In addition, in a separate group of rats with heart failure, we demonstrated that renal angiotensin II concentration increased twofold (P < 0.05) as compared with that of age-matched sham operated controls. A parallel group of heart failure rats (HFe, n = 11) was treated with enalapril (25 mg/kg per d) in drinking water for 6 wk before these measurements. Blood pressure decreased significantly during treatment (91 vs. 103 mm Hg, P < 0.05). Enalapril treatment in HF rats increased renin mRNA level (2.5-fold, P < 0.005), KRC (5.6-fold, P = 0.005), and PRC (15.5-fold, P < 0.005). The increase in renal angiotensinogen mRNA level observed in HFv rats was markedly attenuated in enalapril treated HF rats (P < 0.001), suggesting a positive feedback of angiotensin II on renal angiotensinogen synthesis. These findings demonstrate an activation of intrarenal RAS, but no changes in the circulating counterpart in this model of experimental heart failure, and they support the concept that the intrinsic renal RAS may contribute to the pathophysiology in this syndrome.", 
    "142": "Drugs containing sulfhydryl groups (thiol drugs) (e.g., penicillamine, captopril, thiopronine) can induce pemphigus in vivo and provoke acantholysis in vitro. Enalapril, like captopril, is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor largely used as an antihypertensive drug; it has recently been reported to induce pemphigus, though it is not a thiol drug. In this study we investigated the possible in vitro acantholytic effect of enalapril on normal human skin from donors. The drug induced severe acantholytic changes of keratinocytes and complete suprabasal splitting at one tenth the concentration required by thiol drugs in similar experiments, even after a shorter period of culture. All skin samples from different donors was highly susceptible to the acantholytic effect of enalapril. In our experience, enalapril is the most powerful acantholytic drug in vitro.", 
    "143": "The effects of trandolapril (0.25 mg/kg body wt per 48 hours) on aortic atherosclerosis were examined in the Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic rabbit treated from 3 to 12 months of age. Trandolapril caused a significant decrease in atherosclerotic involvement of the intimal surface of total aorta from 56.3 +/- 5.0% in control Watanabe rabbits to 35.0 +/- 4.1% with treatment (p less than 0.01). The largest reductions were observed in descending thoracic aorta where 21.8 +/- 5.7% of intimal surface was involved in the trandolapril-treated animals versus 54.4 +/- 7.7% in the control group (p less than 0.01). Significant decreases also occurred in ascending aorta/arch and abdominal aortic segments. Cholesterol content of descending thoracic aorta was also significantly reduced in the trandolapril-treated rabbits. The atherosclerotic plaques in aorta from trandolapril-treated rabbits appeared to contain less foam cells and relatively greater amounts of connective tissue than those from control animals. These studies indicate that trandolapril inhibits aortic atherosclerosis in the Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic rabbit. The similarity in results between the current study and that using captopril suggests that the antiatherosclerotic action of trandolapril and captopril represents a class effect related to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition.", 
    "144": "The hypertensive transgenic rat [TGR (mRen-2)27] is a genetic model of hypertension in which transfection of the Ren-2 mouse renin gene into rats results in severe hypertension. These transgenic rats express a high level of renin in the adrenal gland, and the hypertension is ameliorated by treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. In this study we investigated the distribution of adrenal renin in the TGR rat and examined the regulation of adrenal renin in a monolayer culture of adrenal cells. High concentrations of active renin and prorenin were found in the adrenal capsular (glomerulosa) and decapsular (fasciculata-medullary) portions of the TGR adrenal. This is in contrast with the Sprague-Dawley (S-D) rat, in which adrenal renin is found mostly in the active form and located primarily in the glomerulosa cells. The zonal distribution of aldosterone was also different in the TGR, with substantial amounts of aldosterone in the zona fasciculata as well as in the glomerulosa, while in the S-D rat, aldosterone is limited to the zona glomerulosa. In the primary monolayer culture of glomerulosa cells, TGR cells had significantly higher levels of active renin and prorenin and showed an increased response to ACTH and high potassium in the medium. Renin activity in the medium was predominantly in the form of prorenin and significantly higher than that in the S-D rat. Cultured fasciculata cells from TGR also produce renin that is stimulated by ACTH, but not by a high potassium concentration. Renin activity in the adrenal homogenate, medium, and plasma from TGR rats was completely inhibited by the renin inhibitor (CP 71362; 1 microM), but only slightly inhibited (12.3 +/- 3%) by a monoclonal antibody that inhibits renin activity from S-D rat tissues by 79.2 +/- 2.5%, suggesting that renin in the plasma and adrenal glands from TGR appears to derive primarily from mouse renin. In conclusion, the TGR (mRen-2)27 rats have higher than normal levels of adrenal renin, and the cultured cells show an exaggerated renin response to ACTH and potassium. The distribution of the renin enzyme in the adrenal zones of the TGR is similar to the distribution of mouse adrenal renin.", 
    "145": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition with enalapril increases the number of glomeruli with juxtaglomerular cells and the number of cells in the afferent arteriole that express the renin gene and contain renin. However, renin release from these newly recruited renin-containing cells has not been demonstrated. Sodium depletion also has been shown to increase renal renin messenger RNA levels. The aim of these studies was to determine whether increases in renin secretion are a result of altered numbers of cells synthesizing/releasing renin or a change in the amount of renin release per cell, or both. Adult Wistar-Kyoto rats were treated with enalapril or sodium depleted and single cell renin secretion of enzymatically dispersed renal cortical cells was examined by reverse hemolytic plaque assay. Enalapril treatment increased the number of renin secreting cells by approximately 10-fold (P < 0.05). The newly recruited renin-secreting cells were not responsive to changes in extracellular calcium concentration or the presence of isoproterenol. At physiological (2.5 mM) extracellular calcium concentration, the amount of renin secreted per cell was approximately 2-fold greater (P < 0.05) when cells from enalapril-treated rats were compared to controls and sodium depletion increased both the number of renin-secreting cells and the amount of renin secreted by approximately 35% (P < 0.05). Angiotensin II (AII) inhibited the number of cells secreting renin in cortical cells prepared from enalapril-treated and control rats. In conclusion, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition increased renin secretion predominantly by recruitment of additional renin-secreting cells and, to a lesser extent, by augmentation of the amount of renin released per cell. In contrast, sodium depletion increased renin secretion equally by both mechanisms. Newly recruited renin-secreting cells were not regulated by the extracellular calcium concentration or beta-adrenergic stimulation. Angiotensin II inhibited renin secretion directly by decreasing the number of individual cells releasing renin through a process which was independent of the extracellular calcium concentration.", 
    "146": "The question, of whether long-term treatment of essential hypertension with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors is capable of modifying glucose tolerance or insulin sensitivity in Type 2 (non-insulin dependent) diabetes, is still unsolved. We studied 14 moderately overweight Type 2 diabetic patients with essential hypertension in stable metabolic control after a run-in period and again after 3 months of antihypertensive treatment with the ACE inhibitor, captopril. Glucose tolerance was tested with a 75-g oral glucose load and insulin sensitivity was measured by the insulin suppression test, while dietary and drug treatment of the diabetes remained constant. In the whole group, mean blood pressure (MBP) fell progressively over 3 months from a baseline value of 123 +/- 3 mmHg to a final value of 115 +/- 2 mmHg (p < 0.005); in six patients, the change in MBP was < 5 mmHg (non-responders), thus giving a clinical response rate of approximately 60%. After treatment, fasting plasma glucose, insulin, free fatty acid (FFA), potassium, and glycated haemoglobin concentrations were unchanged from baseline. During the oral glucose tolerance test, the incremental glucose area-under-curve was 0.75 +/- 0.05 mol 120 min l-1 before and 0.76 +/- 0.06 mol 120 min l-1 after treatment (p = ns). Endogenous insulin response and suppression of plasma FFA levels were superimposable on the two occasions. During the insulin suppression test, steady-state plasma glucose levels were 14.4 +/- 1.3 vs 14.2 +/- 1.1 mmol l-1 before and after chronic ACE inhibition, respectively, at comparable hyperinsulinaemic plateaux (291 +/- 21 vs 287 +/- 14 pmol l-1).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "147": "Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) levels were measured in 17 patients with severe congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association functional class IV), and the response of the peptide was studied during changes in cardiac filling pressures induced by a 24-hour infusion of nitroglycerin. In the control state plasma ANP levels (687 +/- 551 pg/ml) were 10-fold normal. During the administration of nitroglycerin, natriuretic peptide levels decreased (p less than 0.005) with changes matching very closely the decreases in pulmonary arterial wedge and right atrial pressures, a 1% mean decrease in the peptide level for every 1.5 to 2% mean change in atrial filling pressures. In patients with hemodynamic tolerance to constant-dose nitroglycerin infusion, the resulting increase in atrial pressures was accompanied by an appropriate secondary increase in the plasma ANP level. During the 24-hour study period there was a direct linear relationship between both wedge (r = 0.93, p = 0.007) and right atrial (r = 0.93, p = 0.008) pressures and the plasma ANP level, with a zero-pressure ANP intercept near normal (69 pg/ml for wedge, 174 pg/ml for right atrial pressure). The findings were no different in a subgroup of five patients receiving simultaneous treatment with captopril, except that plasma renin activity was higher and the aldosterone level lower than in the control group by a factor of approximately 2.5. The close relationship and tracking of atrial pressure and natriuretic peptide curves suggested that the sensitivity of the atrial stretch response to changes in atrial filling pressures was maintained in severe congestive heart failure.",

    "153": "Dried bonito (Katsuobusi), a Japanese traditional seasoning made of bonito muscle was hydrolyzed by various proteases and the inhibitory activity of the hydrolyzates for angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) [EC 3.4.15.1] was measured. Among the digests, thermolysin digest showed the most potent inhibitory activity. Eight inhibitory peptides were isolated from the digest using HPLC. The amino acid sequences of inhibitory peptides were Ile-Lys-Pro-Leu-Asn-Tyr, Ile-Val-Gly-Arg-Pro-Arg-His-Gln-Gly, Ile-Trp-His-His-Thr, Ala-Leu-Pro-His-Ala, Phe-Gln-Pro, Leu-Lys-Pro-Asn-Met, Ile-Tyr, and Asp-Tyr-Gly-Leu-Tyr-Pro. By searching for the sequence homology in many proteins, four of them were found in the primary structure of actin. Asp-Met-Ile-Pro-Ala-Gln-Lys was obtained from the boiling water extract of dried bonito and this peptide was found in the primary structure of creatine kinase. Fragments of these peptides were prepared by further enzymatic digestion or chemical synthesis and their ACE-inhibitory activities were measured.

    "154": "Research on antihypertensive drugs not only provides new information on presently used agents but also leads to the introduction of exciting new compounds. Several important clinical trials involving currently available drugs have been published recently. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors improved survival in patients with milder degrees of congestive heart failure, which indicates that they have become the cornerstone of treatment for this condition. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors delayed or prevented the development of diabetic proteinuria (> 200 micrograms/min) in a placebo-controlled randomized trial. Further, enalapril was more effective than metoprolol in reducing the rate of decline in renal function in patients with type I diabetes. Calcium channel blockers protected against acute renal failure in patients after renal transplantation in two separate studies. Calcium channel blockers were shown to promote natriuresis, with negative sodium balance the same as that associated with thiazide diuretics. The voltage-dependent calcium channel has been cloned, and the binding sites of the three classes of calcium channel blockers are now known. beta-Blockers and thiazide diuretics were the drug treatments in the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program trial and in the Swedish Trial in Old Patients with Hypertension study (patients 65 to 85 years). In both investigations, stroke and cardiovascular events were significantly reduced by these conventional inexpensive agents. Clonidine was found to lower blood pressure primarily by its interaction with the imidazole receptor rather than the alpha 2 receptor. Elucidation of the imidazole receptor promises to shed light on physiologic mechanisms as well as lead to the introduction of new agents, such as moxonidine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

In nephrotic syndrome, interest has focused on the use of cyclosporine in steroid-resistant patients, treatment of progressive membranous nephropathy with alkylating agents, and symptomatic management of unresponsive cases with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. The most recent data on lupus nephritis establish the efficacy of intravenous cyclophosphamide in the long-term preservation of renal function and the lack of benefit of plasmapheresis in patients with severe disease. In rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, the discovery of circulating antibodies to neutrophil cytoplasmic antigens has proved valuable in diagnosing certain forms of renal vasculitis.

    "156": "In the follow-up of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus patients with renal disease, a decline in glomerular filtration rate measured by an exact technique is the major primary end point in evaluating the progress of the disease. Abnormal albuminuria is considered an intermediate or secondary end point. All studies suggest that an increase in albuminuria indicates a decline or a risk of future decline in glomerular filtration rate. The main risk factor for progression appears to be the elevated blood pressure (which in itself may be a pathogenetic factor) that is associated with abnormal albumiuria from the microalbuminuric level. Abnormal albuminuria seems to always be associated with the risk of progression, and a reversal of abnormal albuminuria suggests a beneficial prognosis. Abnormal albuminuria is easily monitored by immunochemical procedures, including semiquantitative dipstick tests that may be important in renal screening procedures. Elevated blood pressure is important for the progression of abnormal albuminuria, but poor metabolic control seems to be the major initiating factor (although the mechanisms at a molecular biologic level are less clear). New studies confirm the strong predictive value of microalbuminuria for overt renal disease. At the same time, it is clear that microalbuminuria is associated with many cardiovascular abnormalities that cluster in some patients and is clearly associated with a poor prognosis. An intervention strategy is to achieve the best possible metabolic control without creating hypoglycemic problems or too difficult a lifestyle. Increasingly, studies underscore the value of early antihypertensive therapy, especially with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, in patients with microalbuminuria. This scenario of earlier and earlier antihypertensive treatment for microalbuminuric patients is evolving. Numerous studies indicate that microalbuminuria is stabilized or reversed by this treatment, and some new evidence suggests better preservation of glomerular filtration rate by this intervention program. Accumulating results also suggest considerable improvement in survival rate with this program in proteinuric insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus patients.", 
    "157": "In vitro coronary artery responsiveness to angiotensin I, angiotensin II, noradrenaline, phenylephrine, BHT 920, and potassium chloride together with functional relaxation to acetylcholine was investigated in dogs with pacing-induced heart failure treated with enalapril (oral administration of 10 mg.day-1) for a mean duration of 26 days. Although maximal responses generated to both angiotensin I and angiotensin II were unaltered in the enalapril-treated group, angiotensin II became more potent following enalapril treatment: the EC50 for angiotensin II following placebo treatment was 2.4 (0.6-5.8; 95% confidence limits) nM and following enalapril treatment was 0.03 (0.007-0.1; 95% confidence limits) nM. In addition to the above changes, coronary artery rings from dogs treated with enalapril developed significantly less tension to noradrenaline, phenylephrine, and BHT 920. In contrast, responses to potassium chloride were unaltered following enalapril treatment. However, the relaxation to acetylcholine was enhanced from 38.9 +/- 3.0 to 50.4 +/- 3.5% (placebo versus enalapril, p < 0.05). These findings indicate that enalapril may possess alpha-blocking properties and enhance the relaxation response to acetylcholine through an endothelial-dependent mechanism in addition to inhibiting converting enzyme.",

Recognition of this detrimental aspect has prompted intensive investigation into the mechanisms by which systemic hypertension promotes diabetic glomerulopathy, as well as into potential benefits of antihypertensive therapy. Studies in diabetic rats, both normotensive and hypertensive, have established that certain antihypertensive regimens effectively slow the development of albuminuria and glomerular sclerosis. Most consistently effective have been angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, which may act to protect the kidney by several different mechanisms. Other antihypertensive regimens have been less consistent.", 
    "159": "Isolated systolic hypertension occurs with increased prevalence in the elderly population. It is characterized by reduced vascular compliance, often combined with increased peripheral resistance. These changes are not specific to patients with systolic hypertension, occurring, perhaps to a lesser extent, in the normotensive aging population as well. Systolic hypertension is associated with a risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality that possibly exceeds that associated with systolic-diastolic hypertension. However, until the recent report of the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program, the benefit of treatment of this population was undocumented. The Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program demonstrated that lowering of blood pressure with a diuretic, combined, when necessary, with a beta blocker, reduced the rate of myocardial infarction and stroke. Other agents may also be effective in lowering blood pressure, although their ability to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in this population remains to be documented. The results suggest that pharmacologic treatment be considered for patients older than 60 years whose systolic blood pressure remains above 160 mm Hg (with a diastolic pressure below 90 mm Hg). Whether treatment should be recommended for all patients with systolic hypertension, or, alternatively, for only those at higher risk for cardiovascular events, remains controversial.",

Twelve patients with essential hypertension, aged 35 to 59 years, stabilized (blood pressure less than 140/90 mmHg) with captopril, received ketoprofen (100 mg bid for 7 days) or matching placebo in a randomized double-blind cross-over fashion. A 3-week wash-out period was included between treatment periods. Blood pressure on the first and last days of the placebo treatment period (137 +/- 7 (SD)/80 +/- 8 and 139 +/- 11/81 +/- 9 mmHg) was similar to respective values during ketoprofen therapy (136 +/- 10/79 +/- 7 and 143 +/- 10/81 +/- 9 mmHg). The mean differences in systolic and diastolic blood pressures, at the end of the treatment periods, between ketoprofen and placebo were 4 (95% confidence intervals -5, +13) and 0 (-8, +8) mmHg, respectively. Ketoprofen had no effect on 24-h urinary sodium excretion (160 +/- 33 and 147 +/- 39 mmol/24 h for ketoprofen and placebo, respectively). Ketoprofen was without effect on glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow and filtration fraction.

    "166": "The identification of elements of the renin-angiotensin system and ulterior demonstration of specific cellular angiotensin II (Ag II) receptors at hypothalamic-pituitary level has suggested the possibility that these peptide play a modulatory role on anterior pituitary secretion. Recent \"in vivo\" and \"in vitro\" studies provided confirmation of a stimulatory effect of the renin-angiotensin system on growth hormone (GH) and ACTH variable. Initial experiments indicate that there is no effect on TSH and gonadotrophins secretion. Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors leads to a reduction of Ag II levels that results in slight decrease of PRL and GH concentrations. However, the mechanism by which Ag II is able to modulate anterior pituitary secretion still remains obscure. Both, indirect effects mediated through changes in neuropeptide secretion or a direct interaction on pituitary cells by a paracrine or endocrine mechanism emerge as possible hypothesis to explain this regulatory function.",

Acute administration of lisinopril, both in untreated hypertensive patients (visit 1) and during long-term treatment (visit 2), decreased blood pressure (p < 0.05) and increased renal plasma flow (p < 0.05), while cardiac output and glomerular filtration rate were unchanged. Comparison of baseline parameters between visits 1 and 2 showed that chronic treatment with lisinopril decreased blood pressure and renal vascular resistance and that these effects were still significant 24-hours postdosage. We conclude that lisinopril is an effective antihypertensive agent with favorable renal hemodynamic effects.", 
    "175": "SOLVD was a double-masked, placebo-controlled trial whose initial sample size goal was to randomize 6100 participants into two concurrent trials: treatment and prevention. The objective was to determine if participants with severe left ventricular dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction < or = 35%, with congestive heart failure (2569) and participants without overt heart failure (4228) had improved survival with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Participants were identified from cardiac catheterization, echocardiography and radionuclide laboratories, and inpatient units. The treatment trial recruitment goal was attained 13 months ahead of schedule while recruitment for the prevention trial was extended 11 months beyond the scheduled time. Recruitment of relatively asymptomatic participants with a low ejection fraction in a hospital-based trial necessitated novel strategies. Coronary care units and clinics for follow-up of acute cardiac conditions, not typically employed in studies of chronic diseases, were useful recruitment sources. Different approaches to encourage participation also needed to be employed. Expanding selected entry criteria was evaluated and the success of varying strategies was reviewed. The authors recommend tailoring of strategies to the target population, staffing flexibility, principal investigator involvement, and broad entry criteria in recruitment activities.", 
    "176": "1. The present study was performed in anaesthetized, artificially ventilated, open-chested rabbits to examine whether (a) the rapidly adapting receptors of the airways were stimulated by exogenously administered bradykinin, and (b) if this sensitivity could be enhanced by the angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, enalapril. 2. Rapidly adapting receptor activity (n = 8) was recorded from the cervical vagus. Bradykinin was injected intravenously (0.25-1.0 microgram/kg) and a dose-response curve relating receptor activity to bradykinin was elicited. In the control state, the threshold dose of bradykinin required for stimulation of rapidly adapting receptors was 0.53 +/- 0.11 microgram/kg. Five minutes after the administration of enalapril maleate (2 mg intravenously), the dose-response curve was shifted to the left significantly (P < 0.01). 3. In seven other rapidly adapting receptors, enalapril (2 mg) increased the resting activity significantly (P < 0.05) over a period of 60 min. This increase was significantly different from the spontaneous variation in neural activity of rapidly adapting receptors (n = 7) recorded over a period of 60 min. 4. Bradykinin either alone (0.25-1.0 microgram/kg) or in the presence of enalapril did not stimulate the slowly adapting receptors (n = 5) of the airways. 5. These results show that (a) exogenous bradykinin stimulates the rapidly adapting receptors, (b) the sensitivity of rapidly adapting receptors to bradykinin is enhanced by enalapril and (c) enalapril increases the resting activity of rapidly adapting receptors. It is suggested that the cough reported after the administration of enalapril may be due to stimulation of rapidly adapting receptors of the airways.", 
    "177": "To assess whether timing of administration can influence the antihypertensive effect of quinapril, 18 patients with hypertension were studied with noninvasive ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Quinapril, 20 mg, was given at 8 AM or 10 PM for 4 weeks in a double-blind crossover fashion. To study the pattern of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition with the two treatment regimens, plasma ACE activity was measured in seven subjects 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours after quinapril administration. The 24-hour blood pressure profiles showed a more sustained antihypertensive action with the evening administration of quinapril compared with the morning administration of quinapril; as with the morning administration, a partial loss of effectiveness was observed during nighttime hours. Measurement of ACE activity showed that evening administration caused a less pronounced but a more sustained decline of plasma ACE. These findings show that 20 mg quinapril given once daily is effective in lowering blood pressure levels throughout a 24-hour period. The evening administration seems to be preferable because it causes a more favorable modulation of ACE inhibition and therefore determines a more homogeneous 24-hour blood pressure control.",

With increased prescribing of newer, longer-acting agents, this potentially lethal adverse reaction is of even greater concern. Because angioedema associated with ACE inhibitors is a class-related event, the number of reported cases would be expected to increase with increasing numbers of prescriptions written for these drugs. This report, describing a patient who developed angioedema following therapy with lisinopril, illustrates the severity of this adverse reaction.", 
    "182": "A 66-year-old man presented to the emergency room complaining of increased swelling of the back of his throat and difficulty breathing. Despite treatment with epinephrine, antihistamines, and corticosteroids, the patient's condition progressed from that of severe laryngeal edema to total laryngospasm and complete airway obstruction. Emergency measures to intubate the patient were complicated by severe swelling of his neck and oropharynx, forcing the physician to perform a grossly traumatic tracheotomy. The difficulty encountered during intubation deprived the patient of oxygen for a significant amount of time, precipitating cardiopulmonary arrest. The anoxic episode resulted in hypoxic, ischemic encephalopathy and, ultimately, death.", 
    "183": "Angioedema is a serious, potentially life-threatening adverse effect associated with the use of ACE inhibitors. Clinicians need to be aware of this effect when prescribing ACE inhibitors to treat hypertension and congestive heart failure, and when assessing patients presenting to the emergency room with complaints of tongue or pharyngeal swelling. Patients should be instructed to report immediately to an emergency room for medical attention if they experience any unexplained shortness of breath or swelling of the throat or tongue.", 
    "184": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE (peptidyl-dipeptidase A, EC 3.4.15.1)] was purified from a total cell membrane fraction of rat intestinal mucosa. A 4,500-fold purification was achieved after affinity chromatography with lisinopril-Sepharose and gel filtration. The final preparation was judged to be homogenous by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with an apparent molecular weight of 160,000. The purified protein is a glycoenzyme containing 12% N-linked carbohydrate. Purified ACE had a specific activity of 65 U/mg protein with benzoyl-Gly-His-Leu as substrate. A kinetic analysis showed that the enzyme had the maximal velocity with substrates containing proline at the COOH-terminal end. Inhibitor studies indicated that the enzyme is a metalloprotein. Along the proximal-distal axis of the small intestine, ACE activity is most predominant in the proximal to middle portions, decreasing toward the distal end. This pattern was also observed for ACE mRNA and protein, suggesting that ACE expression is controlled at the level of mRNA. Perfusion of benzoyl-Gly-His-Leu in vivo through a segment of intestinal jejunum demonstrated that ACE is an important intestinal dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase, participating in the digestion and assimilation of dietary peptides.", 
    "185": "Exposure to angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors has been associated with increased ACE activity in vivo and in vitro. In the current study, we examined the effects of the active site-directed ACE inhibitors lisinopril and captopril on ACE gene expression and activity in cultured porcine pulmonary artery endothelial cells. Exposure of endothelial cells to both lisinopril and captopril was associated with increased ACE mRNA levels and concomitant increases in ACE activity. These effects were both concentration and time dependent. ACE mRNA levels began to increase within 30 min of ACE inhibitor exposure and showed an early peak at 2 h and a higher, delayed peak at 48 h. ACE activity peaked at 24 h. Both ACE mRNA levels and activity were highest during incubation with 100 microM inhibitor. Nuclear runoff assays indicated that 48 h of exposure to 100 microM of either captopril or lisinopril increased ACE gene transcription approximately threefold relative to a tubulin control, a level comparable to the increases in ACE mRNA levels and activity observed during ACE inhibitor exposure. These findings support the hypothesis that ACE gene expression endothelial cells is stimulated by active site-directed ACE inhibitors in vitro. This provides a molecular mechanism for the observation that plasma and tissue ACE activity in vivo is increased during chronic exposure to ACE inhibitors.", 
    "186": "This study was aimed at evaluating the factors responsible for the marked renal hemodynamic effect of 6-day treatment with lisinopril. Blood pressure (BP) and renal blood flow (RBF) were monitored in six groups of rabbits. Animals treated with lisinopril for 6 days (Group I) had lower BP (77 +/- 3 mm Hg) than normal controls (Groups II/III, 106 +/- 3 mm Hg, P < .05) or those given lisinopril acutely (Group IV, 93 +/- 8 mm Hg, P < .05). In addition, RBF was higher in Group I (81 +/- 2 ml/min) than in Groups II/III (54 +/- 5 ml/min, P < .05) or Group IV (66 +/- 8 ml/min, P < .05). Intrarenal arterial infusion of a B2 bradykinin receptor antagonist, D-Arg-O-[Hyp-3-Thi-5,8-D-Phe-7]bradykinin, had no effect on either BP or RBF in Group I. Administration of lisinopril for 6 days also resulted in attenuation of the vasoconstrictor responses to renal nerve stimulation (Group V). Intravenous infusion of D-Arg-O-[Hyp-3-Thi-5,8-D-Phe-7]bradykinin had no effect on the responses to nerve stimulation in lisinopril-treated rabbits (Group V) or their controls (Group VI). Moreover, D-Arg-O-[Hyp-3-Thi-5,8-D-Phe-7]bradykinin given i.v. did not alter the BP or RBF in Groups V and VI. The results indicate that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition over a 6-day period is more effective than acute inhibition in lowering BP and dilating the renal vascular bed. The use of bradykinin antagonists did not indicate kinin involvement in the long-term effect of lisinopril on BP and RBF.", 
    "187": "We investigated the preventive effects of long-term treatment with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril on myocardial left ventricular hypertrophy and capillary length density in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Rats were treated in utero and subsequently up to 20 weeks of age with a high dose (1 mg/kg per day) or with a low dose (0.01 mg/kg per day) of ramipril. Animals given a high dose of ramipril remained normotensive, whereas those given a low dose developed hypertension in parallel to vehicle-treated controls. At the end of the treatment period, converting enzyme activity in heart tissue was inhibited dose-dependently in the treated groups. Both groups revealed an increase in myocardial capillary length density together with increased myocardial glycogen and reduced citric acid concentrations. Left ventricular mass was reduced only in high dose- but not in low dose-treated animals. Our results demonstrate that early onset treatment with a converting enzyme inhibitor can induce myocardial capillary proliferation, even at doses too low to antagonize the development of hypertension or left ventricular hypertrophy. We hypothesize that potentiation of kinins is responsible for this effect, probably by augmenting myocardial blood flow, which is a well-known trigger mechanism of angiogenesis in the heart.", 
    "188": "Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a common condition and a powerful independent risk factor for coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, and other cardiac morbidity. It is associated with the male sex and advancing age. Its most common cause is hypertension, and many antihypertensive agents induce regression of LVH. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to reverse LVH by a mechanism as yet unknown. Reduction in afterload and other hemodynamic abnormalities by reduction of blood pressure is clearly a factor, but ACE inhibitors also block adrenergic action and other sympathetic nervous system influences, and the reduction in angiotensin II produces many effects. By inhibiting this potent vasoconstrictor and suppressing its degradation of the powerful vasodilator bradykinin, and by promoting sodium and water excretion, ACE inhibitors contribute to the restoration of normal ventricular function. Angiotensin II promotes protein synthesis in myocardial myocytes, and blocking this action may arrest the hypertrophic process. To determine the effect of angiotensin II on LVH and normalization of LV function, a study is now underway evaluating the effects of lisinopril, a new lysine analog of enalapril, and a diuretic agent in the treatment of hypertension LVH.", 
    "189": "To examine the cellular mechanisms of contractile dysfunction in postinfarction heart failure, we studied the effects of beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation on contractile function and Ca2+i handling of noninfarcted papillary muscles from sham-operated (n = 17) and infarcted (n = 17) rats. Ca2+i transients measured with the bioluminescent protein aequorin and parameters of isometric contraction were recorded during graded isoproterenol stimulation. Developed tension and peak rate of tension rise were depressed (p less than 0.05) in muscles from infarcted rats at physiological and maximally stimulating [Ca2+]oS. The time to peak tension was prolonged in the muscles from the infarcted rats, corresponding with prolongation of the time to peak Ca2+i. In muscles from sham-operated rats, isoproterenol increased both the amplitude of the Ca2+i transient and the peak rate of tension rise. In contrast, the inotropic response to isoproterenol was severely blunted in the muscles from infarcted rats despite a large increase in the amplitude of the Ca2+i transient. Isoproterenol abbreviated the time course of the isometric twitch and the Ca2+i transient in both groups. These findings suggest that postinfarction heart failure may be related in part to decreased force-generating capacity of the myofilaments. Treatment with captopril for 5 weeks, beginning 1 week after infarction (n = 14), resulted in reduction of left ventricular filling pressures and partial normalization of myocardial contractility and Ca2+i handling. In addition, compared with muscles from untreated infarcted rats, muscles from the captopril-treated rats exhibited improved contractile responses to increasing [Ca2+]o or isoproterenol. The inotropic response to isoproterenol in muscles from all three groups of rats had a significant negative correlation (r = -0.64, p less than 0.0001) with left ventricular end-diastolic pressure measured in vivo. Thus, the defect in excitation-contraction coupling in rats with postinfarction heart failure may be partially normalized by chronic load reduction with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor.", 
    "190": "Two thousand and seventy-one elderly isolated systolic hypertensive patients entered the multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial (997 in the active treatment group and 1,074 in the placebo). The differences of age, height, weight, sex constituent and baseline blood pressure between active treatment and placebo groups yielded no significances. In the 30-month follow-up period, the systolic and diastolic blood pressure in the active treatment were lower than the placebo group (P < 0.05) since the third month of the trial; the side effects were mild and the compliance of the participants was good (97% of the participants in the active treatment was taking medicine punctually during follow-up period; and 96% of the participants in the placebo group did so as well). The average morbidity of isolated systolic hypertension in our country was 8.10%, and the morbidity in female was higher than that in male, based upon the results of our trial. The present trial is in progress and the final results will not be reported until the end of the trial.", 
    "191": "Sixty-three hypertensive patients with probability of obstructive renal artery disease underwent both Captopril renal scintigraphy (CRS) and echo-Doppler flowmetry (EDF) before undergoing renal angiography. Angiography revealed renal artery stenosis (RAS) in 42 patients (unilaterally in 26 and bilaterally in 16). The sensitivity and specificity in the identification of RAS > or = 50% were 90% and 94%, respectively for Captopril renography, and 85% and 78% for echo-Doppler flowmetry. Captopril renography correctly identified stenoses greater than 50%, which is usually held to be the limit of hemodynamic significance. While the Doppler examination was more sensitive than Captopril renography (sensitivity 79% versus 64%) in the detection of all degrees of RAS, less information on the functional significance of RAS was provided. Both CRS and EDF could be usefully employed to assess kidney perfusion, but their appropriate clinical use must take into account inherent differences between the two techniques.", 
    "192": "The relative contribution of nitric oxide (NO) and cyclo-oxygenase products in the dilator response to equieffective doses of acetylcholine (ACh) and bradykinin (Bk) was studied in the isolated, saline-perfused rabbit heart under constant flow conditions. ACh (1 microM) and Bk (10 nM) induced a similar vasodilation, with a maximum reduction in coronary perfusion pressure (CPP) of 27 +/- 2%. The vasodilation induced by both agonists was associated with an enhanced release of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha from the coronary bed, with the Bk-induced increase in 6-keto-PGF1 alpha being threefold greater than that induced by ACh. The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor ramiprilat (0.3 microM) selectively enhanced both the 6-keto-PGF1 alpha outflow and the dilator response to Bk. The B2-receptor antagonist Hoe 140 (0.1 microM) blocked both Bk effects. The cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor diclofenac (1 microM) halved the dilator response to Bk, but did not affect the vasodilation to ACh. Both agonists induced the release of NO, as assessed by the increase in cyclic GMP content of platelets passing through the vascular bed. However, ACh induced a 2.5-fold greater increase in platelet cyclic GMP content, compared to Bk. Treatment of hearts with NG-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA, 30 microM) halved the ACh- and Bk-induced maximum reduction in CPP. Combined infusion of L-NNA and diclofenac completely blocked the dilator response to Bk, and inhibited the vasodilation to ACh more efficiently than L-NNA alone. We conclude that both NO and PGI2 contribute to the coronary dilator response to Bk and ACh in the rabbit Langendorff heart.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "193": "The influence of the renin-angiotensin system on the control of cell communication was investigated in isolated ventricular cell pairs of adult rats. It was found that angiotensin II (1 microgram/ml) reduced the junctional conductance (gj) by about 55% within 20 s. This effect of angiotensin II was suppressed by DuP 753--an angiotensin receptor blocking agent. Enalapril (1 microgram/ml)--an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor--caused an increase in junctional conductance (106%) within 2 min. The effect of enalapril on gj was not related to activation of beta-adrenergic receptors or cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The effect of angiotensin II on gj was suppressed by staurosporine--a potent inhibitor of protein kinase C. This finding indicates that the peptide is changing gj through activation of protein kinase C. The increase in cell coupling caused by enalapril raises the possibility that the antiarrhythmic action of enalapril as well its effect in congestive heart failure are related to an increase in electrical synchronization of cardiac myocytes.", 
    "194": "Short-term effects of alacepril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), on renal function and hemodynamics were investigated in 10 hypertensive subjects (aged 55.7 +/- 9.5 years, mean +/- SD). Renal plasma flow (RPF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were examined before and after 12-week administration of alacepril, by [131I]hippuran and [99mTc]DTPA, respectively. Alacepril (50 mg/day) caused a significant decrease in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP, from 161 +/- 8 to 140 +/- 10 mm Hg and from 100 +/- 3 to 90 +/- 5 mm Hg, respectively). Alacepril increased GFR (from 63.4 +/- 22.2 to 69.1 +/- 22.1 ml/min/1.73 m2, p less than 0.05) without changing RPF (from 438 +/- 194 to 432 +/- 148 ml/min/1.73 m2, p greater than 0.05). Serum creatinine and electrolytes were not changed by alacepril administration. These data show that short-term alacepril administration improves renal function, probably owing to relaxation of renal vasoconstriction.", 
    "195": "Smooth muscle proliferation of injured blood vessels leads to pathologically significant stenosis in animals and humans. We report here the pharmacological confirmation of an involvement of angiotensin II in this process as a major, necessary mediator of neointima formation. In the rat carotid artery, an animal model of post-angioplastic restenosis, we have obtained by local intraluminal infusion of peptidic angiotensin II antagonist after balloon catheterization, suppression of neointima formation and preservation of the luminal integrity. Sham operated control animals treated without medication and operated control animals treated simultaneously with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and with agonistic angiotensin II, suffered major stenosis through the myoproliferative response of the injured vessel. These results prove that angiotensin II plays a key role as a mediator of vascular neointima formation.", 
    "196": "In order to assess the responsibility of medicinal drugs for the disorders in electrolytes observed in elderly people, the prevalence of abnormal natraemia and kalaemia was prospectively established in 631 subjects aged 70 or more on the first day of hospitalization. Among 337 subjects not taking drugs likely to create problems (diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, anti-inflammatory agents) 3.6 percent had hyponatraemia (below 130 mmol/l) and 12.2 percent had hypokalaemia (below 3.5 mmol/l). Subjects with normal renal function who were taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents showed no more electrolytic abnormalities than those who did not take them. Conversely, subjects on thiazides were more frequently hyponatraemic (11.8 percent) or hypokalaemic (16.2 percent; 20 percent in the absence of associated distal diuretics). These abnormalities were more frequent in women than in men (21.7 and 13 percent). This, together with the fact that 68 percent of subjects taking thiazides were women accounts for the marked female predominance of electrolytic abnormalities reported in the literature.", 
    "197": "The presence of diastolic dysfunction in a hypertensive patient is not necessarily associated to the existence of left ventricular hypertrophy.

    "201": "The hemodynamic and antianginal effects of the organic nitrates are greatly reduced during therapy designed to provide 24-hour protection throughout each day. Although the mechanisms of tolerance are not clearly understood, it is likely that tolerance is related to a combination of reduced sulfhydryl groups in vascular smooth muscle and neurohormonal activation. These changes would reduce nitrate-induced vasodilation and induce sodium and water retention with an increase in plasma volume. These reflex neurohormonal changes would reduce the hemodynamic effect of any given degree of nitrate-induced vasodilation. Although preliminary studies suggest that diuretic therapy or the use of converting enzyme inhibitors may reduce or abolish tolerance, further clinical studies are required to confirm these findings.", 
    "202": "Aminopeptidase activities were identified in extracts of kidney, ovotestis, head ganglia, heart and haemolymph of Aplysia californica. These enzyme preparations hydrolysed [3H][Leu]enkephalin at the Try-1-Gly-2 bond as determined by h.p.l.c. analysis of cleavage products. In all these tissues, enkephalin-degrading aminopeptidase activities were present both in membrane-bound and cytosolic fractions. The bivalent-cation-chelating agent, 1,10-phenanthroline, inhibited kidney membrane aminopeptidase activity with an IC50 of 30 microM, suggesting that this enzyme is a metalloproteinase. The aminopeptidase inhibitor amastatin was the most potent inhibitor of [Leu]enkephalin degradation (IC50 25 nM) by membrane-bound aminopeptidase, and bacitracin, bestatin and puromycin were about 100-1000 times less potent. In contrast with membrane-bound aminopeptidase, the cytosolic form is sensitive to puromycin. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor had no effect on [Leu]enkephalin degradation by kidney membranes, while the neutral endopeptidase inhibitors were poor inhibitors of the enzymes in this preparation. The Km values of the aminopeptidase in the kidney membranes and cytosolic fractions for the [Leu]enkephalin substrate were 2.4 and 7.4 microM respectively. The aminopeptidase present in the kidney membranes also hydrolysed endogenous Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-amide peptide at the Phe-1-Met-2 bond as well as synthetic alanine p-nitroanilide and leucine p-nitroanilide. When used in a competition assay, these substrates inhibited hydrolysis of [3H][Leu]enkephalin, suggesting that the same enzyme degraded all these substrates. Taken together, these results suggest that Aplysia tissues contain both a membrane-bound aminopeptidase related to the mammalian aminopeptidase N and a cytosolic puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase.", 
    "203": "Left ventricular dilatation and dysfunction after myocardial infarction are major predictors of death. In experimental and clinical studies, longterm therapy with the angiotensin-converting--enzyme inhibitor captopril attenuated ventricular dilatation and remodeling.

    "204": "Within 3 to 16 days after myocardial infarction, 2231 patients with ejection fractions of 40 percent or less but without overt heart failure or symptoms of myocardial ischemia were randomly assigned to receive doubleblind treatment with either placebo (1116 patients) or captopril (1115 patients) and were followed for an average of 42 months.", 
    "205": "Mortality from all causes was significantly reduced in the captopril group (228 deaths, or 20 percent) as compared with the placebo group (275 deaths, or 25 percent); the reduction in risk was 19 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 3 to 32 percent; P = 0.019). In addition, the incidence of both fatal and nonfatal major cardiovascular events was consistently reduced in the captopril group. The reduction in risk was 21 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 5 to 35 percent; P = 0.014) for death from cardiovascular causes, 37 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 20 to 50 percent; P less than 0.001) for the development of severe heart failure, 22 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 4 to 37 percent; P = 0.019) for congestive heart failure requiring hospitalization, and 25 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 5 to 40 percent; P = 0.015) for recurrent myocardial infarction.",

    "207": "In patients with diabetes mellitus, metabolic control, hypertension and kidney function are important prognostic factors. In this respect ACE inhibitors exhibit, according to previous publications, a potentially beneficial effect on diabetic patients. To further clarify this effect of ACE inhibitors, a meta-analysis of 21 studies of type I and II diabetics under therapy with ACE inhibitors was performed. Altogether 325 cases were analyzed. The duration of diabetes varied between 2.5 and 22 years. Therapy with ACE inhibitors under long-term treatment (up to 12 months) reduced diastolic blood pressure (-25%) and, both for type I and II diabetics, fasting blood sugar (-14%) and HbA1 (-9%). Microalbuminuria/proteinuria was reduced by 33% under short-term treatment with ACE inhibitors (up to 3 months) and by 66% under long-term treatment. Analysis of the subgroups with microalbuminuria (30-300 mg/day, n = 48) or clinical proteinuria (greater than 300-1500 mg/day, n = 9) showed similar results. The outcome of this meta-analysis shows that the treatment of diabetic patients with ACE inhibitors not only effectively reduces high blood pressure but also reduces microalbuminuria/proteinuria and, in addition, exhibits an anti-hyperglycemic effect by improving blood sugar levels.", 
    "208": "The incidence of hypertension is increased in obesity, a state associated with an insulin resistance syndrome. By using an euglycemic clamp method, Ferrannini et al. demonstrated the existence of an insulin resistance state in patients with essential hypertension. However, the body mass index of the subjects studied appeared to be slightly excessive. This abnormality has not been observed in patients with secondary hypertension. Insulin resistance is probably localized to peripheral tissues such as muscles and may be associated with other cellular abnormalities. Can insulin resistance, characterized by a raised circulating insulin concentration in the presence of normal blood glucose, be responsible for certain \"modifications\" associated with essential hypertension? Insulin induces sodium retention and increases the aldosterone-secreting effect of angiotensin II. These effects are likely to promote a rise in blood pressure and an increase in the sensitivity of vessels to endogenous substances. Moreover, insulin is a known growth factor and is involved in lipoprotein metabolism. If insulin resistance plays an important role in the maintenance of complications of essential hypertension, it is important that the treatments used tend to correct this anomaly. Thiazide diuretics and beta-blockers aggravate insulin resistance while angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitors correct this condition.",

The relative risk of death in the enalapril group was 1.10 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.93 to 1.29). Death due to progressive heart failure occurred in 104 patients (3.4 percent) in the placebo group and 132 (4.3 percent) in the enalapril group (P = 0.06). Therapy had to be changed because of worsening heart failure in 30 percent of the placebo group and 27 percent of the enalapril group (P less than 0.006). Early hypotension (systolic pressure less than 90 mm Hg or diastolic pressure less than 50 mm Hg) occurred in 12 percent of the enalapril group and 3 percent of the placebo group (P less than 0.001).",

With the results of 2 or more noninvasive tests [assessment of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) by radionuclide ventriculography, grade of ventricular arrhythmias and heart rate variability by Holter monitoring, and ventricular activation by signal averaged electrocardiography], most patients may be stratified into 'very high' and 'very low' risk groups.For patients with 2 or more abnormal noninvasive tests, electrophysiological studies (EPS) may be recommended: if sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) is not induced, patients may be reassured and left without antiarrhythmic therapy other than \u03b2-blockers. For patients with low LVEF, treatment with \u03b2-blockers may be recommended based on post hoc analysis of large prospective trials, while some of the randomised studies with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors suggest that these agents may also reduce the risk of sudden death. For patients with high grade ventricular arrhythmias, \u03b2-blockers and amiodarone may be recommended: the first, based on post hoc analysis of the Betaj Heart Attack Trial, while data supporting the use of amiodarone come from prospective, yet small randomised studies. Empirical or Holter-guided therapy with class 1 antiarrhythmic drugs have not been found useful and may indeed be detrimental.For patients with inducible sustained VT, treatment should be guided by repeated EPS, as empirical antiarrhythmic therapy has not been found useful. However, the value of EPS-guided therapy remains to be proven. Patients with inducible sustained VT refractory to antiarrhythmic drugs are at very high risk. Implantation of an automatic defibrillator is an attractive option for these patients, to be confirmed by ongoing trials.",

Pig submaxillary mucin at 2.3 mM inhibits by 73%. To determine whether the oligosaccharide moieties of the mucins contribute to this inhibition, oligosaccharides were prepared from each mucin by reductive beta-elimination and their effects on enzyme activity determined. Total oligosaccharides from gastric mucin inhibited enzyme activity with an IC50 of 0.3 mM based on the neutral hexose content of the oligosaccharide solution. Fractions isolated from gastric mucin by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and Bio-Gel P-2 inhibited ACE with IC50 values ranging from 2 to 16 mM-oligosaccharide. Larger oligosaccharides inhibited with lower IC50 values than did smaller oligosaccharides. Fractions of average molecular mass 1100 and 740 Da prepared from submaxillary mucin inhibited with IC50 values of 40 and 80 mM-oligosaccharide respectively. Monosaccharides commonly present in serum and membrane glycoproteins were also tested for their effect on ACE. Galactose, N-acetylglucosamine, N-acetylgalactosamine and glucosamine were inhibitory. N-Acetylneuraminic acid stimulated the activity of ACE. Fucose, ethylene glycol and sucrose had no effect on the activity of the enzyme. The influences of different buffers, ion concentrations, pH and substrate structure on the effect of carbohydrate on enzyme activity were also evaluated. The extent of inhibition by the monosaccharide galactose was strongly influenced by buffer ion and substrate concentration. The effects of the oligosaccharide moieties and intact mucins were less sensitive to assay conditions.", 
    "219": "Administration of the pyrrolizidine alkaloid monocrotaline (MCT) to rats results in hypertensive pulmonary vascular disease characterized by a structurally based increase in pulmonary vascular resistance and right ventricular hypertrophy. Alterations in lung angiotensin converting enzyme activity in MCT-treated rats have suggested a role for angiotensin II (AII) in the pathogenesis of this model of hypertensive pulmonary vascular disease. To determine if increases in AII contribute to the development of pulmonary hypertension in MCT-treated rats, we examined the effect of chronic administration of the nonpeptide AII receptor antagonist Losartan on indices of pulmonary hypertension, Losartan (DuP 753; 10 mg/kg s.c.) administration for 21 days did not prevent the development of hypertensive pulmonary vascular disease in MCT-treated rats. However, 18 hr after the last dose of Losartan, AII (0.1 micrograms/kg i.v.)-induced pressor responses were inhibited by 63% in Losartan-treated rats. Losartan administration in MCT-treated rats did not prevent increases in pulmonary artery pressure or development of right ventricular hypertrophy. Additionally, increases in medial arterial thickness in pulmonary artery vessels (less than 50 microns and 50-100 microns external diameter) from MCT-treated rats were still evident in Losartan-treated rats. However, Losartan administration decreased medial pulmonary artery thickness of 50 to 100 microns external diameter vessels in control rats. These results demonstrate that AII. acting at the AT1 receptor subtype, does not contribute to pulmonary hypertension in this animal model.",

Rats were subjected to five-sixths renal ablation and divided into four groups with similar values for blood pressure and serum creatinine after 2 wk. Group 1 then served as untreated controls, while group 2 received the AII receptor antagonist MK954 (which has previously been designated DuP753), group 3 received the converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril, and group 4 received a combination of reserpine, hydralazine, and hydrochlorothiazide. Micropuncture and morphologic studies were performed 10 wk later. Converting enzyme inhibition, AII receptor blockade, and the combination regimen were equally effective in reversing systemic hypertension (time-averaged systolic blood pressure: group 1, 185 +/- 5 mmHg; group 2, 125 +/- 2 mmHg; group 3, 127 +/- 2 mmHg; group 4, 117 +/- 4 mmHg). Micropuncture studies showed that glomerular transcapillary pressure was reduced significantly by converting enzyme inhibition and by AII blockade but not by the combination regimen (delta P: group 1, 49 +/- 1 mmHg; group 2, 42 +/- 1 mmHg; group 3, 40 +/- 2 mmHg, group 4, 47 +/- 1 mmHg). Reduction of systemic blood pressure was associated with the development of markedly less proteinuria and segmental glomerular sclerosis in rats receiving enalapril and MK954 but not in rats receiving the combination regimen (prevalence of glomerular sclerotic lesions: group 1, 41 +/- 4%; group 2, 9 +/- 1%; group 3, 9 +/- 1%; group 4, 33 +/- 6%). These results indicate that the effects of converting enzyme inhibition on remnant glomerular function and structure depend on reduction in AII activity and are not attributable simply to normalization of systemic blood pressure.",

However, no studies have determined whether this antiproteinuric effect modifies the progression of renal insufficiency. We studied the evolution of 46 nondiabetic patients with nephrotic proteinuria treated with captopril for a minimum of 12 months. The follow-up period before captopril treatment was 12 to 18 months. At the end of follow-up, after captopril introduction (24.4 +/- 7.6 months), proteinuria had decreased from 6.3 +/- 2.5 to 3.9 +/- 3.1 g/24 h (P less than 0.001), with a mean decrease of 45% +/- 28%. The proteinuria decrease was higher in patients with reflux nephropathy, proteinuria associated with reduction of renal mass, inactive crescentic glomerulonephritis, nephroangiosclerosis, and IgA nephropathy, whereas patients with membranous glomerulonephritis and idiopathic focal glomerulosclerosis showed a poorer response. Patients were separated according to a proteinuria reduction greater (group A, 23 patients) or lower (group B, 23 patients) than 45% of the initial value. At the end of follow-up, renal function had not significantly changed in group A with respect to values at the start of treatment: serum creatinine (SCr) was 229 +/- 167 mumol/L (2.6 +/- 1.9 mg/dL) versus 203 +/- 97 mumol/L (2.3 +/- 1.1 mg/dL), and creatinine clearance (CrCl) was 0.80 +/- 0.52 mL/s (48 +/- 31 mL/min) versus 0.87 +/- 0.47 mL/s (52 +/- 28 mL/min).

    "222": "Despite improved understanding of both disease mechanisms and the quality of care, congestive heart failure (CHF) remains a serious clinical problem. The traditional treatments, diuretics and digitalis, continue to play a major role in the management of many patients with CHF; however, in the last decade, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been added as an important treatment option. These agents counteract the overstimulation effects of diuretics on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. In addition, some studies indicate that ACE inhibitors may improve symptoms and survival. Recent evidence suggests that in patients with mild to moderate CHF, ACE inhibitor and a diuretic should be administered with or without digitalis to achieve the maximum clinical benefit.", 
    "223": "As the major regulator of arterial blood pressure and sodium balance, the renin axis supports normotension or hypertension via angiotensin-mediated vasoconstriction and angiotensin plus aldosterone-induced renal sodium retention. In this endocrine servo control, renal renin is released by hypotension or salt depletion; conversely, with hypertension or volume excess, plasma renin activity falls to zero. Accordingly, any renal renin secretion is abnormal in the face of arterial hypertension. Human hypertensive disorders comprise a spectrum of abnormal vasoconstriction-volume products (renin-sodium profiles). Excess plasma renin activity for the sodium balance is created by nephron heterogeneity in which a subpopulation of ischemic nephrons hypersecretes renin and retains sodium. This excess renin impairs adaptive natriuresis of neighboring normal nephrons. Research defining the pivotal role of vascular cytosolic calcium for transducing sodium or renin-mediated vasoconstriction explains the selective value of calcium antagonists for correcting the sodium-volume-mediated, and beta-blockers or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors for correcting renin-mediated, arteriolar vasoconstriction. The renin precursor prorenin appears to be physiologically active, causing selective vasodilation that offsets renin-mediated vasoconstriction. Overactivity of prorenin may be involved in the hyperperfusion vascular injuries of diabetes mellitus and toxemias. Prorenin underactivity may facilitate renin-mediated ischemic vascular injury. In essential hypertension, undue plasma renin activity is powerfully and independently associated with heart attack risk. Conversely, patients with low renin activity are protected from heart attack despite higher blood pressures and greater age. Also, renin or angiotensin administration consistently causes vascular injury in the heart, brain, and kidneys of animals. These data suggest new potentials for the prevention of cardiovascular sequelae (heart attack and stroke) by using explicit strategies to curtail plasma renin activity.", 
    "224": "In a double-blind, crossover trial 12 patients with hypertension and peripheral arterial disease were randomized to three months' treatment with captopril 25-50 mg twice daily or nifedipine SR 20-40 mg twice daily. While both treatments were equally effective at lowering blood pressure, postexercise calf blood flow availability was greater during treatment with captopril (P less than 0.04). This was not reflected in walking capacity assessed by treadmill exercise. The results suggest that both captopril and nifedipine are appropriate antihypertensive agents in patients with peripheral arterial disease.",

Ccr was proportional to rat weight, and the ratio of Ccr to body weight was not different in DM and control rats. At 3 mo, average volume of glomeruli isolated from DM rats was less than that of glomeruli from control rats. In contrast, glomerular volume after 5 mo was equal in DM and control rats. No increase in GBM thickness or mesangial volume was observed, nor was any decrease seen in GBM area in DM rats at 5 mo. Kf was lower in DM rats than controls after 3 mo, but not after 5 mo. The Lp of DM and control glomeruli did not differ at 3 mo, but was lower in DM at 5 mo. Insulin therapy improved somatic growth and increased kidney and glomerular size in DM rats; the kidney weight/body weight ratio remained elevated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The investigations were performed in a temperature and humidity-controlled laboratory. Intradermal injections of 1 microgram, 2.5 micrograms and 5 micrograms of bradykinin and normal saline (as control) were made into the forearm skin of eight healthy normotensive male volunteers aged 21-33 years (mean 28 years) at baseline, 2, 4, 8, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours after either 2 mg trandolapril or placebo given orally. Skin blood flow outside the induced weal was monitored by laser Doppler flowmetry (mean of recordings at four sites adjacent to the weal within the flare area). Flare area and weal volume were also measured. Trandolapril reduced the mean arterial pressure. However, there was no evidence that this activity was associated with a potentiation of the cutaneous action of bradykinin. In conclusion, it would appear that potentiation of the action of bradykinin may not be an important contributing factor to the fall in total peripheral vascular resistance associated with ACE inhibition in humans in the control of hypertension.",

    "237": "Adriamycin induces proteinuria and glomerular changes in rats similar to those found in human focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). Progression of this lesion may be slowed by use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition. To evaluate this we injected two groups of Sprague-Dawley rats with Adriamycin (2 intravenous doses of 2 mg/kg given at an interval of 3 weeks). One group of rats received enalapril (50 mg/l) in their drinking water. Control rats were injected with saline. After 28 weeks, the mean whole kidney glomerular filtration rate was significantly less and proteinuria and sclerotic index were significantly greater in rats receiving adriamycin compared with controls (P < 0.05). Administration of enalapril did not decrease proteinuria (545 +/- 398 mg/day vs 494 +/- 325 mg/day, P >0.05) or improve the glomerular filtration rate (0.31 +/- 0.18 ml/min per g kidney weight vs 0.41 +/- 0.21 ml/min per g, P = 0.27). However, treatment with enalapril significantly reduced the mean glomerular sclerotic index compared with untreated rats (1.62 +/- 0.88 vs 0.82 +/- 0.49, P = 0.05). Enalapril may be beneficial in preserving glomerular structure in this experimental model of FSGS.",

The drug was given by oral intubation, from 6-15 days of gestation, at the doses of 0, 3, 10 and 30 mg/kg/day. Reduction in body weight and food consumption were observed in the treated dams. However, food efficiency index, assessed at different periods of gestation was found to be unaffected. On day 20 of gestation, all the dams were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and sign of maternal toxicity, reproduction indices and fetal measures were recorded. The dams treated with enalapril at only the doses of 10 and 30 mg/kg, produced significant decrease in numbers of implants, litter size and incidence of reabsorbed fetuses, and also reduced neonatal growth. No such effects were observed at the lowest dose level (3 mg/kg) used. External, visceral and skeletal examinations of the fetuses of enalapril-treated dams showed several types of variations in all groups, but no consistent pattern were observed. However, a slight increase in skeletal variations was seen with the highest dose (30 mg/kg) group. The data of the present study under the conditions described herein and at the doses employed, revealed no evidence of teratogenesis, but numerous deleterious effects on the fetus were evident.", 
    "239": "Captopril is widely used in severe hypertension. Oral administration takes one-two hours to achieve a maximum effect and is not useful in hypertensive crisis. Few reports describe a more rapid effect on blood pressure following sublingual administration. We evaluated the effect of sublingual captopril 50 mg, in 26 patients with hypertensive crisis. Blood pressure levels started to decrease within 10 minutes and the maximum effect was observed 30 minutes after administration of the tablet. In all patients mean (CI 95%) systolic blood pressure dropped from 202.5 (199-206) mmHg to 160.6 (156-165) mmHg and diastolic blood pressure from 105.6 (102-109) mmHg to 86.9 (83-7-90.1) mmHg. This effect was maintained over two hours. There were no side effects. Sublingual captopril is highly effective in hypertensive crisis and its gradual hypotensive action avoid dangerous abrupt fall in blood pressure.",

    "241": "Our study compared the effects of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (captopril) versus a calcium antagonist (nifedipine) on proteinuria and renal function in patients with diabetic nephropathy. A randomized follow-up study was designed. Type 2 diabetic patients, with established diabetic nephropathy (proteinuria greater than 0.5 g/24 h), were treated with nifedipine (10 patients, group A) or captopril (10 patients, group B) for 6 months. Arterial blood pressure, metabolic parameters, proteinuria and renal function were measured and compared. Mean percentage differences for glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow and filtration fraction between the two groups were calculated. No significant differences were observed in serum glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin (hemoglobin A1c), Na+, K+ or albumin in either group or between groups. Blood pressure decreased significantly with both treatments and mean blood pressure was significantly lower in group A compared with group B at 6 months (Mann-Whitney U-test, P = 0.03). Proteinuria was similar in both groups at randomization, but after 3 and 6 months of treatment significant reductions were observed only in the group treated with captopril (P less than 0.01). A significant decrease in filtration fraction was observed in group B with an increase in group A (Mann-Whitney U-test, P = 0.03). Multiple regression analysis identified the therapeutic agent administered as an independent variable for decrease in proteinuria. It is concluded that antihypertensive treatment with captopril, but not with nifedipine, reduced proteinuria in patients with diabetic nephropathy, although a better mean blood pressure was obtained with nifedipine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "242": "In the human brain, receptor binding sites for angiotensin are found in the striatum and in the substantia nigra pars compacta overlying dopamine-containing cell bodies. In contrast, angiotensin-converting enzyme occurs in the substantia nigra pars reticulata and is enriched in the striosomes of the striatum. In this study, using quantitative in vitro autoradiography, we demonstrate decreased angiotensin receptor binding in the substantia nigra and striatum of postmortem brains from patients with Parkinson's disease. In the same brains the density of binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme shows no consistent change. We propose, from these results, that angiotensin receptors in the striatum are located presynaptically on dopaminergic terminals projecting from the substantia nigra. In contrast, the results support previous studies in rats demonstrating that angiotensin-converting enzyme is associated with striatal neurons projecting to the substantia nigra pars reticulata. These findings raise the possibility that newly emerging drugs that interact with the angiotensin system, particularly converting enzyme inhibitors and new nonpeptide angiotensin receptor blockers, may modulate the brain dopamine system.", 
    "243": "To determine the effects of myocardial infarction-induced left ventricular failure on the mechanical characteristics of the remaining viable myocytes, coronary arterial occlusion was performed in rats, and cell function was examined 1 wk later. Moreover, to establish the mechanisms by which treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors ameliorates cardiac dynamics, captopril was administered immediately after surgery, and the contractile behavior of the unaffected cells was similarly analyzed 7 days later. The severe impairment in left-side pump function was found to be associated with a decrease in the velocities of myocyte shortening and relengthening and peak shortening despite a prolongation of contraction duration. In addition, a uniform property was recognized in myocytes from infarcted and noninfarcted hearts. Longer cells manifested greater velocity of shortening, whereas wider cells of identical length exhibited depressed shortening velocity. After infarction, the depression in cell contractility coupled with lateral expansion of myocytes exceeded the influence on cell mechanical behavior linked to myocyte lengthening leading to an overall decrease in contractility of the hypertrophied cells. Captopril therapy preserved, in part, the ability of myocytes to shorten and relengthen, which was accompanied by a decrease in the lateral and longitudinal expansions of these cells.", 
    "244": "We investigated the role of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) and the renin-angiotensin system as well as the effects of losartan in rats with aortocaval (AC) shunts. Right atrial and left ventricular end-diastolic pressures (LVEDP) were higher and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) was lower in AC shunt animals than in their controls. AC shunt rats presented marked cardiac hypertrophy, decreased right atrial ANF concentration, and increased ventricular ANF content and concentration. Plasma ANF levels were elevated, and hematocrit was lower in AC shunt animals than in controls. Captopril or losartan treatment decreased MAP and returned LVEDP to sham-operated control values. A clear regression of cardiac hypertrophy was evident in both treated AC shunt groups, with plasma ANF levels tending to follow those in sham-operated rats. Plasma COOH-terminal ANF levels were decreased and urinary volume and hematocrit were increased in losartan-treated AC shunt animals. We conclude that chronic angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition and angiotension II receptor antagonism improved hemodynamic conditions, diminished water retention, reversed cardiac hypertrophy, and restored plasma and tissue ANF to more \"normal\" levels in rats with moderate high-output heart failure.", 
    "245": "Experiments were performed in anesthetized rats to examine the possibility that endothelin (ET) modifies renal epithelial function in addition to its well-established hemodynamic actions. Infusion of ET-3 at rates between 34 and 178 ng.kg-1.min-1 was in many cases followed by a rise in urine flow and a persistent decrease in urine osmolality, whereas glomerular filtration rate (GFR) did not significantly change. The extent of ET-induced diuresis was dependent on the response of GFR: in rats in which ET-3 infusion caused a marked reduction of GFR (greater than 70%) ET-induced diuresis was not seen, even though urine osmolality still fell significantly. From animal to animal, ET-induced changes of urine flow or GFR did not correlate significantly with the rate of ET-3 infusion. ET-1, another ET isopeptide, also produced water diuresis when administered in GFR-neutral doses. Urinary excretion of total solutes and of sodium was not significantly altered by ET-3. Infusion of vasopressin blunted the diuretic effect of ET-3, whereas ET-3-induced water diuresis was not measurably altered by chronic or acute treatment with a converting enzyme inhibitor or by acute inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. Induction of water diuresis was not secondary to an inhibition of vasopressin secretion since it could be demonstrated in homozygous Brattleboro rats in which antidiuresis was produced by the infusion of vasopressin at a rate of 200 microU.kg-1.min-1. These data suggest that ET may be an inhibitory modulator of the hydrosmotic action of vasopressin at the level of the renal collecting duct.", 
    "246": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may ameliorate experimental glomerular injury by either hemodynamic or nonhemodynamic mechanisms. In a long-term study, we examined the effects of 30 wk of enalapril treatment on the development of glomerular disease in obese Zucker rats (OZR). Enalapril significantly (P less than 0.05) lowered blood pressure, fasting serum cholesterol, and urine albumin excretion in OZR throughout the experimental period. At 38 wk of age, enalapril-treated OZR had a sixfold reduction in the percent glomeruli exhibiting focal glomerulosclerosis and a 20-30% reduction in kidney weight and glomerular area. A separate micropuncture study in 22- to 26-wk-old rats revealed that untreated OZR with albuminuria and increased blood pressure had elevated glomerular capillary pressure (Pgc). Enalapril-treated OZR had less albuminuria and lower blood pressure, but Pgc was not reduced. The value of the transcapillary hydraulic pressure difference (delta P) in enalapril-treated OZR was intermediate between values in untreated OZR and lean Zucker rats. Thus enalapril markedly attenuated the development of glomerular injury in OZR. The salutary effects of enalapril may have involved a reduction in delta P coupled to a nonhemodynamic action, possibly restriction of glomerular growth or lowering of serum cholesterol.", 
    "247": "Angiotensin is generated within the kidney, but the precise loci for the formation of angiotensin I (ANG I) and angiotensin II (ANG II) have not been demonstrated. We performed electron microscopy immunocytochemistry in kidney sections of 10-day-old (newborn) and adult Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats using specific antibodies to renin, ANG I, ANG II, and angiotensinogen (AO). Renin, ANG I, ANG II, and AO were present in juxtaglomerular (JG) cells. Renin was largely confined to cytoplasmic granules; ANG I and ANG II were colocalized to these granules but also were present in the cytoplasm; AO was distributed throughout the cytoplasm. AO also was present in a renal cortical distribution in proximal tubular cells. Northern blot analysis demonstrated AO mRNA in total kidney and liver but not in renal microvessels. Using the reverse hemolytic plaque assay, we demonstrated release of ANG I and renin from individual renocortical cells of adult WKY rats. Under control conditions, the number of releasing cells was 11 +/- 1 for ANG I and 10 +/- 1 for renin. Addition of rat renin inhibitor (RI) (1 x 10(-5) M), which inhibited renin activity in the medium from 37 to 9 pg ANG I.ml-1.h-1, did not alter ANG I plaque number. Addition of rat AO increased ANG I plaque number to 17 +/- 2 (P less than 0.05). Incubation with both RI and AO prevented the increase in ANG I plaque number obtained with AO alone. Enalapril treatment (7 days; n = 5) increased the number of plaque-forming cells to 22 +/- 2 for ANG I (P less than 0.0005) and to 39 +/- 7 for renin (P less than 0.001). The results suggest an intracellular location for AO and angiotensin and release of renin and ANG I by renal cortical cells and suggest that released angiotensin is produced intracellularly and that secretion of ANG I is augmented by converting enzyme inhibition.", 
    "248": "To evaluate platelet activation thromboxane A2 (TxA2) and beta-thromboglobulin (beta TG) were used as markers and in addition we studied the biosynthesis of prostacyclin. Synthesis of TxA2 and prostacyclin was assessed by measurement of urinary metabolites. Fifteen untreated hypertensive patients (HT) and 15 age-matched normotensive controls (NT) were investigated at rest, during and after exercise. HT patients were re-examined after 3 months on enalapril. During basal conditions there was no difference in the excretion of Tx-M, PGI-M or beta TG between the groups. During strenuous exercise HT exhibit a significantly higher increase in prostacyclin synthesis (162%) compared to NT (76%). The levels of beta TG increased with 82% in the HT and 24% in the NT group, Tx-M increased with 27% and 23% respectively. Treatment with the ACE-inhibitor enalapril did not significantly alter these findings. These results indicate that there is no evidence of basal platelet activation in early essential hypertension. Strenuous exercise leads to some increase in Tx-M in both groups, with no pronounced differences between the groups. Hypertensive patients exhibit a significantly increased prostacyclin response to exercise which could be due to differences in vessel-wall reactivity. Enalapril seems to exert no effect on platelet activation or on prostacyclin biosynthesis.", 
    "249": "The role of gastric secretion in drinking was investigated. Treatment of pigs with cimetidine (300 mg IV), which inhibits gastric secretion, did not change the level of feed or water intake, or alter the temporal relationship between eating and drinking. Gastric infusions of 0.15 M HCl (5 ml.kg-1.h-1) did not increase drinking. Pentagastrin infusion (0.05 microgram.kg-1.min-1) increased water intake in some, but not all pigs during a 1-hour infusion. Plasma protein levels increased significantly during 1-hour pentagastrin infusions (0.05 microgram.kg-1.min-1), indicating an estimated fall in blood volume of 2.5%. Captopril (1.75 mg/kg IV), which blocks the renin-angiotensin system, abolished pentagastrin-stimulated drinking. It was concluded that gastric secretion does not play a direct role in normal, periprandial drinking but that in pigs the renin-angiotensin system is involved in pentagastrin-stimulated drinking.", 
    "250": "The effects of total food deprivation on renal function were evaluated in normal Munich-Wistar rats submitted to starvation (S) periods of two to eight days (Groups S2 to S8). A prompt and sustained decrease in renal plasma flow (RPF) and an increase in total renal vascular resistance (TRVR) were observed after the second day, together with a gradual decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) until the fourth day (40% in the S4 group, P less than 0.05). After this period, a spontaneous and progressive increase in GFR occurred in spite of continuing low RPF and high TRVR. Glomerular hemodynamics were evaluated in additional animals from groups S4 and S7. As observed for whole kidney GFR, mean single nephron (SN) GFR was reduced in group S4, but not in group S7. The decline in SNGFR in S4 was the result of a decline (approximately 40%) in glomerular plasma flow rate (QA) and glomerular capillary hydraulic pressure (PGC), due to a predominant increase (approximately 60%) in afferent arteriolar resistance. In S7, SNGFR and its determinants did not differ from the control. Angiotensin II (Ang II), prostaglandin (but not thromboxane A2, TxA2) inhibition blunted the alterations in whole kidney function observed in S4. Conversely in S7, the inhibition of vasoconstrictor agents (Ang II and TxA2) did not normalize GFR, suggesting that the intrarenal vasoconstriction could be an important factor to maintain GFR after a prolonged period of starvation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "251": "A markedly hypertensive, 70-year-old, black man had been on captopril for 2 years when he rapidly developed obstructive angioedema. The initial sign of difficulty in understanding his speech progressed to severe laryngeal and glossal edema over a 3 1/2 h period. His airway became obstructed less than a minute after arrival at the emergency room. Oral intubation was unsuccessful, and a difficult tracheostomy was too late to save the patient. The death was reported to the medical examiner because of its sudden and unusual nature. The risk of angioedema while on angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor therapy has been noted previously in the clinical literature. Because of the sudden onset and possible confusion with an allergic reaction, this entity is brought to the attention of the forensic medical community.", 
    "252": "Increased activity of the renin-angiotensin system may be involved in sodium and water retention during controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). We therefore evaluated renal, hemodynamic, and hormonal effects of an acute angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (ACEI) during PEEP and extracellular volume expansion in five trained chronically tracheotomized dogs. Three protocols were performed: control, 4 h spontaneous breathing with continuous positive mean airway pressure (Paw) of 4 cmH2O (CPAP 4); CMV 20, CPAP for 1st h, CMV with 20 cmH2O Paw for 2 h (2nd and 3rd h), and 1 h of CPAP (4th h); and CMV20-ACEI, ACEI (Ramipril, 2 mg/kg body wt) followed by the same protocol as in CMV 20. During control, sodium excretion (UNaV) and urine volume (V) increased continuously to 56.2 +/- 2.7 (SE) mumol.min-1.kg body wt-1 and 482 +/- 23 microliters.min-1.kg body wt-1, respectively. UNaV and V increased less during PEEP in CMV 20 and CMV 20-ACEI. However, significantly more sodium and water were retained in CMV 20 than in CMV 20-ACEI (2.3 +/- 0.3 vs. 1.0 +/- 0.3 mmol/kg body wt, and 20 +/- 3 vs. 11 +/- 2 ml/kg body wt) because of a decrease of glomerular filtration rate and fractional UNaV in CMV 20. Heart rate did not change in control, CMV 20, or CMV 20-ACEI. Mean arterial pressure increased during control by 13 mmHg, did not change during CMV 20, and was decreased by 7 mmHg in CMV 20-ACEI.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "253": "To study the role of neutral endopeptidase (NEP) on endothelin-1-induced contraction of the airway smooth muscle, we examined the contractile effect of endothelin-1 in the isolated guinea pig trachea and human bronchus in the presence or absence of NEP inhibitor phosphoramidon. After incubation with phosphoramidon (10(-8) to 10(-5) M), we added endothelin-1 cumulatively from 10(-11) to 10(-7) M to the airway tissues in organ baths. Phosphoramidon significantly potentiated the endothelin-1-induced contraction in a concentration-dependent fashion in both guinea pig trachea and human bronchus, and it shifted the concentration-response curves to the left. Because NEP is known to cleave tachykinins, we next studied whether endothelin-1 contracts airway tissues by releasing endogenous tachykinins from bronchial C-fibers. After incubation with phosphoramidon (10(-5) M), we added endothelin-1 cumulatively from 10(-11) to 10(-7) M to the tissues that were treated with capsaicin to deplete the tachykinins. Phosphoramidon significantly potentiated the endothelin-1-induced contraction in the capsaicin-treated tissues, suggesting that endothelin-1 causes the contraction, at least in part, without releasing tachykinins. In contrast to the effect of phosphoramidon, captopril (an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor), leupeptin (a serine protease inhibitor), and bestatin (an aminopeptidase inhibitor) did not modulate the effect of endothelin-1-induced contraction in both guinea pig trachea and human bronchus. From these results, we conclude that NEP plays an important role in regulating endothelin-1-induced contraction in the guinea pig trachea and human bronchus.", 
    "254": "By using biopsies, skeletal muscle metabolism was investigated in 22 patients with severe chronic heart failure. All the patients were in New York Heart Association functional class IV and constituted a subgroup of the previously published CONSENSUS trial. After this initial investigation of muscle metabolism in patients with chronic heart failure, the influence of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril, on skeletal muscle metabolism was studied by randomizing the patients in a double-blind manner to receive either placebo (n = 11) or enalapril (n = 11) in addition to conventional treatment. At the time of inclusion, the muscle content of energy-rich compounds, i.e. glycogen and the high energy phosphates, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and phosphocreatine, was reduced as compared with healthy subjects and muscle lactate content tended to be higher than normal. Following study treatment, no significant changes occurred, neither within nor between the two subgroups. Thus, patients with severe chronic congestive heart failure display metabolic derangement in muscle, which, in this study, was not corrected by treatment with enalapril.", 
    "255": "Methods of glomerular filtration rate measurement by 51Cr EDTA elimination, inulin clearance and creatinine clearance were compared with and without captopril pretreatment in 10 chronic heart failure patients and in 20 patients after transmural myocardial infarction. Strong intermethod correlations were found in chronic heart failure patients (EDTA: inulin r = 0.87; EDTA: creatinine r = 0.84; inulin: creatinine r = 0.9; all P less than 0.00001). Despite this, substantial absolute differences were observed in results obtained by different techniques. In particular, creatinine clearance significantly overestimated both 51Cr EDTA (18.0 +/- 18.4 ml.min-1, mean difference +/- SD, P less than 0.001) and inulin clearance (26.8 +/- 17.0 ml.min-1, P less than 0.001). The slight reduction in 51Cr EDTA elimination on captopril versus placebo (-8.3 +/- 9.2 ml.min-1, P less than 0.05) was related to a similar treatment difference in inulin clearance (r = 0.67, p = 0.03), but changes observed by either method were unrelated to captopril-induced changes in creatinine clearance. Thus, creatinine clearance is an unsatisfactory means of assessing the effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition on glomerular filtration rate in chronic heart failure. In the post-myocardial infarction group, correlations between methods were poorer (EDTA: inulin r = 0.79; EDTA: creatinine r = 0.76; inulin: creatinine r = 0.67). In this group no significant effect of captopril on glomerular filtration rate was detected by any technique. As compared to the chronic heart failure patients, the weaker relationship between techniques post-myocardial infarction may be related to interference by thrombolytic or aspirin treatment.", 
    "256": "Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) are widely used in patients with severe heart failure on the basis of the significant improvement in mortality in the CONSENSUS-I trial in patients with Class IV heart failure. Recent data from the 5-year clinical trial Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD) suggest a role for ACE-I in patients with mild to moderate heart failure as well as in those with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction. The SOLVD treatment trial in patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than or equal to 35% and treated for heart failure with conventional therapy including digitalis, diuretics, or vasodilators demonstrated that the addition of enalapril resulted in a significant reduction in mortality from heart failure as well as in the combined end point of death plus hospitalization from heart failure. These data suggest that ACE-I should be the base of therapy for patients with mild to moderate heart failure, as well as for those with severe heart failure.", 
    "257": "Increases of triglycerides and total cholesterol have been reported during treatment with antihypertensive drugs, most notably with beta blockers and diuretics. ACE inhibitors, on the other hand, are not known for having a negative effect on lipid profile. To evaluate the effects of a fixed combination of captopril and hydrochlorothiazide on lipid metabolism, blood pressure, and quality of life, we performed an open prospective study. A total of 2,154 patients with or without hypercholesterolemia, but not receiving lipid lowering drugs, were enrolled. Of the 1891 evaluable patients at baseline, 34.1% had a moderate risk with total cholesterol between 5.2 and 6.5 mmol/l (mean 5.8 mmol/l) and 41.3% had a high coronary heart disease (CHD) risk with total cholesterol higher than 6.5 mmol/l (mean 7.3 mmol/l). After six months of treatment, the median cholesterol level in the moderate risk group decreased from 5.8 to 5.4 mmol/l (p less than 0.0003) and in the high risk group from 7.3 to 6.3 mmol/l (p less than 0.0001). Triglycerides also decreased, whereas high density lipoprotein (HDL) increased in both risk groups. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure fell as expected and quality of life improved. The fixed combination was well tolerated. We observed a significant improvement of lipid profile in patients with mild to moderate hypertension while undergoing treatment with the fixed combination of captopril and hydrochlorothiazide. We suggest that captopril may balance the negative effects of hydrochlorothiazide on lipid metabolism in patients with hypertension and concomitant hyperlipidemia.", 
    "258": "Nonpeptide angiotensin AT-1 and AT-2 receptor antagonists were administered cerebroventricularly to rats and their effects on various types of angiotensin II (AII)-stimulated water and NaCl intakes examined. The AT-1 receptor blocker, losartan potassium (DUP 753), inhibited water intake evoked by central administration of AII, with the 50% inhibitory dose being less than 0.1 microgram. The functional inhibition by higher doses lasted at least 1 h. The AT-2 receptor antagonist PD 123319 also inhibited AII-induced water intake, but at doses about tenfold higher than losartan. Central, but not peripheral, administration of losartan partially inhibited NaCl intake induced by either sodium depletion, treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (CEIs), or adrenalectomy. PD 123319 partially inhibited NaCl intake induced by both sodium depletion and administration of CEI, but not after adrenalectomy. Another AT-2 receptor antagonist, CGP 42112A, likewise inhibited NaCl intake after sodium deprivation. These data suggest that both AT-1 and AT-2 receptor subtypes in the brain are involved in angiotensin-related water and NaCl intakes.", 
    "259": "1. A scheme for augmented spontaneous reporting of adverse drug events using advanced view data systems was developed and applied to study 67,698 consecutive patients prescribed captopril in general practice for the treatment of hypertension. 2. Captopril was an effective hypotensive agent in this population, as only 1.9% of patients were withdrawn because of apparent inefficacy. 3. Adverse effects of captopril resulted in withdrawal of treatment in 8.9% of recipients, and such effects were more frequent in elderly and female recipients. 4. Skin reactions--usually maculopapular rashes--tended to occur early during therapy whereas cough occurred much later and was reported more frequently in non-smokers. 5. Some 1.1% of recipients died during follow-up. There was no evidence of any unusual or unexpected causes of death which might be partially or totally captopril-related in the study cohort. 6. The study confirms the feasibility of large scale postmarketing surveillance studied in general practice and allowed risk benefit assessments to be made on the use of captopril for treating hypertension.", 
    "260": "This article reports on the effects of captopril on both the prevention and the regression of myocardial cell hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis in experimental animals (rats) with pressure overloaded hearts. Constriction of the abdominal aorta just below the diaphragm during periods of 20 days (prevention experiment) and 40 days (regression experiment) resulted in hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy. In the prevention experiment, captopril was able to inhibit the development of high blood pressure levels and cardiac hypertrophy in aortic-constricted rats. Similarly, the treatment of sham-operated rats with captopril led to a reduction in the weight of the heart and in the myocyte diameter compared with controls. The myocyte volume fraction of the left ventricles of both aortic-constricted and sham-operated animals that were treated with captopril was significantly diminished compared with that of the control group. The interstitial collagen volume fraction of all experimental groups was elevated as compared with the control group. As a consequence, the ratios of myocytes to interstitial collagen in groups of aortic-constricted rats, aortic-constricted rats that were treated with captopril, and sham-operated rats that were treated with captopril were reduced compared with the control group; that is, although captopril was able to prevent myocardial cell hypertrophy after aortic constriction, it could not prevent the maintenance of a normal ratio of myocytes to interstitial collagen, which was due to increased collagen volume fraction. In the regression experiment, captopril lowered high blood pressure levels and augmented heart weights to control values. The mean myocyte transverse diameter in aortic-constricted rats that were treated with captopril was significantly smaller than that of controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "261": "Infarct expansion remains an important sequela of myocardial infarction. Both angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and intravenous nitrates reduce early infarct expansion in humans. This is believed to be caused by the reduction in left ventricular systolic wall stress that results from the arteriolar vasodilatation they produce. Patients are frequently already receiving calcium channel blockers at the time of infarction or these drugs are sometimes administered in the perimyocardial infarction period. The calcium blockers of the dihydropyridine class might be expected to modify infarct expansion. However, their effect on this process has not been studied. We therefore evaluated the effect of early treatment with the calcium blocker amlodipine, a potent arteriolar vasodilator with minimal negative inotropic properties, on chronic myocardial infarction in the rat. Permanent left coronary occlusion was created after pretreatment with amlodipine, 0.25 mg/kg (low dose) or 1.0 mg/kg (high dose), or placebo, intravenously twice a day, and continued for 7 days after infarction. Hearts (n = 50) were perfusion fixed 21 days after infarction and analyzed for infarct extent, scar thickness, left ventricular shape and size, and expansion index. Both doses decreased mean blood pressure (119 +/- 3 to 99 +/- 5 mm Hg low dose, p = 0.004; 110 +/- 5 to 84 +/- 4 mm Hg high dose, p = 0.0003), with reflex tachycardia only after the high dose (heart rate 395 +/- 9 to 434 +/- 11, p = 0.001). Infarct extent was equal in the three groups (39 +/- 2%, 41 +/- 2%, and 41 +/- 3% of left ventricular circumference for control, low, and high doses, respectively). The three groups did not differ significantly with regard to left ventricular cavity cross-sectional area (80 +/- 4, 77 +/- 3, and 87 +/- 3 mm2, control, low, and high doses, respectively; p = 0.07 high dose vs control), mean scar thickness (0.74 +/- 0.06, 0.73 +/- 0.05, and 0.65 +/- 0.06 mm, control, low, and high doses, respectively; p = NS), and expansion index (1.52 +/- 0.10, 1.58 +/- 0.12, and 1.95 +/- 0.19, control, low, and high doses, respectively; p = 0.08 high dose vs control). In the subgroup with larger infarcts (infarct extent greater than 0.39 of left ventricle), the expansion index was higher in the high-dose group (2.37 +/- 0.23 vs 1.64 +/- 0.17 control; p = 0.04). In this model, treatment with amlodipine does not limit infarct extent or reduce early infarct expansion and left ventricular dilatation, even when initiated before infarction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "262": "Each approach to the prevention of sudden death after myocardial infarction should be analysed not only according to its value in the risk stratification of patients but also for its potential impact in guiding therapy. With the results of 2 or more noninvasive tests [assessment of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) by radionuclide ventriculography, grade of ventricular arrhythmias and heart rate variability by Holter monitoring, and ventricular activation by signal averaged electrocardiography], most patients may be stratified into 'very high' and 'very low' risk groups. For patients with 2 or more abnormal noninvasive tests, electrophysiological studies (EPS) may be recommended: if sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) is not induced, patients may be reassured and left without antiarrhythmic therapy other than beta-blockers. For patients with low LVEF, treatment with beta-blockers may be recommended based on post hoc analysis of large prospective trials, while some of the randomised studies with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors suggest that these agents may also reduce the risk of sudden death. For patients with high grade ventricular arrhythmias, beta-blockers and amiodarone may be recommended: the first, based on post hoc analysis of the Beta Heart Attack Trial, while data supporting the use of amiodarone come from prospective, yet small randomised studies. Empirical or Holter-guided therapy with class 1 antiarrhythmic drugs have not been found useful and may indeed be detrimental. For patients with inducible sustained VT, treatment should be guided by repeated EPS, as empirical antiarrhythmic therapy has not been found useful. However, the value of EPS-guided therapy remains to be proven. Patients with inducible sustained VT refractory to antiarrhythmic drugs are at very high risk. Implantation of an automatic defibrillator is an attractive option for these patients, to be confirmed by ongoing trials.", 
    "263": "Considerable evidence now indicates that a separate and distinct renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is present within the brain. The necessary precursors and enzymes required for the formation and degradation of the biologically active forms of angiotensins have been identified in brain tissues as have angiotensin binding sites. Although this brain RAS appears to be regulated independently from the peripheral RAS, circulating angiotensins do exert a portion of their actions via stimulation of brain angiotensin receptors located in circumventricular organs. These circumventricular organs are located in the proximity of brain ventricles, are richly vascularized and possess a reduced blood-brain barrier thus permitting accessibility by peptides. In this way the brain RAS interacts with other neurotransmitter and neuromodulator systems and contributes to the regulation of blood pressure, body fluid homeostasis, cyclicity of reproductive hormones and sexual behavior, and perhaps plays a role in other functions such as memory acquisition and recall, sensory acuity including pain perception and exploratory behavior. An overactive brain RAS has been identified as one of the factors contributing to the pathogenesis and maintenance of hypertension in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) model of human essential hypertension. Oral treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, which interfere with the formation of angiotensin II, prevents the development of hypertension in young SHR by acting, at least in part, upon the brain RAS. Delivery of converting enzyme inhibitors or specific angiotensin receptor antagonists into the brain significantly reduces blood pressure in adult SHR. Thus, if the SHR is an appropriate model of human essential hypertension (there is controversy concerning its usefulness), the potential contribution of the brain RAS to this dysfunction must be considered during the development of future antihypertensive compounds.",

    "265": "The association of hypothyroidism and coronary artery disease is not uncommon. The precipitation of angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, and even myocardial infarction may occur in patients when initiating rapid replacement therapy for hypothyroidism. This is particularly true when replacement therapy is instituted in elderly persons or in patients with preexisting coronary artery disease. A starting daily dose of 12.5 to 25 micrograms and increments of 25 micrograms every 2 to 3 weeks is recommended. Close monitoring of cardiac symptoms is essential to avoid side effects. Medical management of angina pectoris includes administration of beta-blockers, nitrates, or at times combination antianginal therapy may be most effective. Persistence of angina in these patients may require coronary angiography with subsequent angioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery.", 
    "266": "The high mortality rate from coronary heart disease in hypertensives can only be substantially reduced if sudden coronary death rates can be decreased. The aim of this review is to discuss how treatment may be tailored to reduce the risk of sudden death in high-risk patients. Clinical trials have not yet produced long-term primary prevention data on the effects of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium antagonists or alpha-blockers on cardiovascular complications and sudden death in hypertensive patients. Further, the conclusion from large-scale secondary preventive studies presently available on ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists is that their impact on sudden death has been disappointing. By contrast, some beta-blockers have reduced sudden death and other coronary events both in primary and secondary preventive studies. The benefits have been attributed to beta 1-blockade, and seem to be independent of blood pressure control. It cannot be assumed that all beta-blockers are equally effective in preventing ventricular fibrillation, sudden death and other coronary events. To date, the best documented data cover the lipophilic beta-blockers and it is speculated that by increasing levels of cardiac vagal tone and electrical stability in the heart, beta 1-blockade in the brain might contribute to the reduction in sudden death risk seen with these beta-blockers.",

Of all patients, 16 males and 6 females, age 45 +/- 13 years, diabetes duration 19 +/- 11 years, insulin dose 38 +/- 11 U/day, 10 were normotensive and 12 were hypertensive. After 3 months of run-in period the patients were assigned to treatment with 5 mg or 10 mg enalapril based on the presence of normotension or hypertension respectively. Before and after 6 months of treatment, renal function was assessed by evaluation of glomerular filtration rate (99m Tc-DTPA), renal plasma flow (131-I iodohippurate), filtration fraction and renal vascular resistance. Mean arterial pressure, albumin excretion rate, urinary urea excretion and glycated haemoglobin were also determined.", 
    "269": "Administration of enalapril resulted in both groups of patients in a significant fall in mean arterial pressure, albumin excretion rate, glomerular filtration rate, filtration fraction, and renal vascular resistance. Decreasing albumin excretion did not correlate with a drop in systemic blood pressure or filtration fraction.

    "271": "A case of angioedema induced by antihypertensive therapy with lisinopril is presented. The patient was a 70 year old black woman, with a history of hypertension for 15 years. The patient presented with acute onset of swelling involving the oro-facial region and respiratory distress after ingestion of three doses of lisinopril over a three day period. A clinical diagnosis of drug induced angioedema was made based on clinical presentation. The patient was treated with diphenhydramine, 50 mg intravenously, and hydrocortisone 100 mg every eight hours with resolution of her symptoms over a 24 hour period. Angioedema should be recognized as a possible life threatening complication of therapy with lisinopril, and other angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. This usually responds to therapy with antihistamines and steroids if recognized early.", 
    "272": "Inhibitors of metallopeptidases may represent new alternatives in the treatment of cardiovascular disease. Recent investigations have linked the hypotensive properties of the metalloendopeptidase 3.4.24.15 (MEP 24.15) inhibitor c-phenylpropyl-alanyl-alanyl-phenylalanyl-para-aminobenzoate (cFP-A-A-F-pAB) to the attenuation of bradykinin metabolism. However, since angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is widely recognized to contribute to the metabolic clearance of bradykinin, we characterized the specificity of cFP-A-A-F-pAB towards ACE. We also determined whether cFP-A-A-F-pAB inhibits the conversion of angiotensin I (Ang I) to Ang II by pulmonary ACE. The ACE activity toward the synthetic substrate hippuryl-histidine-leucine (Hip-His-Leu) was measured in vitro using both a purified lung preparation and pooled rat serum. The ACE activity was inhibited at increasing concentrations of the MEP 24.15 inhibitor. Kinetic analysis revealed that cFP-A-A-F-pAB competitively inhibited pulmonary ACE with a Ki of 0.19 microM. In rat serum, cFP-A-A-F-pAB also competitively inhibited ACE. The hydrolysis of Ang I into Ang II by pulmonary ACE was inhibited to a similar extent by both cFP-A-A-F-pAB and the ACE inhibitor MK 422. These findings are the first to show that the MEP 24.15 inhibitor cFP-A-A-F-pAB also inhibits ACE. We suggest that the reported hypotensive actions of cFP-A-A-F-pAB may be due to the reduction in both bradykinin metabolism and Ang II generation arising from the blockade of ACE.", 
    "273": "The efficacy and tolerability of Prinivil and Procardia XL were compared in 135 (67 black, 68 white) patients with mild to moderate uncomplicated essential hypertension. The goal of therapy was to achieve and maintain a supine diastolic blood pressure (SDBP) of > 90 mmHg or a decrease in SDBP > or = 10 mmHg. Patients received Prinivil 10 to 40 mg once daily or Procardia XL 30 to 120 mg once daily during a titration period of 2 to 8 weeks to achieve the goal blood pressure before a 4-week maintenance period. The mean baseline supine systolic/diastolic blood pressures were 151/97 mmHg in patients receiving Prinivil and 153/99 mmHg in patients receiving Procardia XL. Ninety-one percent of patients receiving Prinivil and 95% of those receiving Procardia XL achieved SDBP control at the end of titration therapy. At the end of the maintenance treatment period, 79% of patients receiving Prinivil and 80% of those receiving Procardia XL had SDBP control. Mean decreases in SDBP from baseline were comparable for both treatment groups. At the end of the titration period, mean decreases were 9.6 mmHg in patients receiving Prinivil and 11.3 mmHg in patients receiving Procardia XL; at the end of the maintenance period, mean decreases were 10.8 mmHg and 12.1 mmHg, respectively. There were no differences in treatment responses in either the black or white hypertensive subgroups. Thus both drugs were equally effective in black and white patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. Both drugs were generally well tolerated, but the number of adverse experiences requiring discontinuation of therapy was significantly higher (P = 0.03) in patients receiving Procardia XL.", 
    "274": "The pulsatility index (PI) of blood flow velocities has been reported to vary with changes in peripheral vascular resistance. Since blood flow velocities can easily be detected with the Echo-Color-Doppler technique in interlobar arteries of normally positioned kidneys, we tried in six healthy volunteers to estimate pharmacological induced variations in renal plasma flow (RPF) and renovascular resistance (RVR) by means of PI measurements. In this study no significant correlation between the absolute values of PI and RVR was found. In order to correct PI for different blood pressure-inputs to the renal artery, PI was divided by the pulsatility of the systemic arterial pressure, i.e. the 'blood pressure index' [BPI = (SAD-DAP)/MAP)], resulting in the 'velocity blood-pressure index' (VBI = PI/BPI), which was significantly correlated with RVR (r = 0.54, P less than 0.01). The pharmacological induced changes of RPF and RVR (delta RPF, delta RVR) were also correlated to the respective changes of PI and VBI (delta PI, delta VBI), with the highest significance when delta VBI was plotted against delta RVR (r = 0.83, P less than 0.0001). VBI, i.e. the pulsatility index of blood flow velocities as corrected for the pulsatility of the driving force, may be a tool for noninvasive assessment of changes in RVR and thereby of importance for the diagnosis and follow-up of renovascular diseases.", 
    "275": "The hemodynamic effects of imidapril, a novel nonsulfhydryl angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, were examined in anesthetized dogs by the intravenous injection of its active metabolite 6366A ((4S)-3-((2S)-2-[N-((1S)-1-carboxy-3- phenylpropyl)amino]propionyl)-1-methyl-2-oxoimidazolidine-4-carboxylic acid, CAS 89371-44-8) and were compared to those of enalaprilat. 6366A (1-100 micrograms/kg) reduced the blood pressure and total peripheral resistance in a dose-dependent manner, while causing no marked changes in heart rate, LV dp/dtmax, and pulmonary arterial pressure. The cardiac output and stroke volume were slightly increased. Blood flow in the common carotid artery, the vertebral artery, and the femoral artery was reduced or tended to decrease, while the superior mesenteric arterial blood flow was increased. These effects were similar to those of enalaprilat. 6366A did not inhibit the pressor response of angiotensin II, but markedly inhibited that of angiotensin I, and the effects of 6366A on regional blood flow were opposite to those of angiotensin II. Thus, 6366A appears to produce its hemodynamic effects by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition, as does enalaprilat. 6366A also tended to decrease myocardial oxygen consumption. These results suggested that the hemodynamic effects of imidapril on the heart and on regional blood flow are similar to those of enalapril.", 
    "276": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in brain, cerebrospinal fluid (C.S.F.) and peripheral tissues was studied ex vivo after oral administration of ceronapril (SQ 29,852) to male Sprague-Dawley rats. Angiotensin converting enzyme in tissue was measured by in vitro autoradiography or enzymatic assay. In in vitro experiments, ceronapril inhibited ACE in slices of brain with an IC50 of approximately 34 nM, as measured by in vitro autoradiography. In C.S.F. ACE was inhibited with an IC50 of approximately 34 nM, as assessed by a fluorimetric enzyme assay. Ceronapril (100 mg/kg, p.o.) inhibited ACE in plasma, kidney and lung rapidly (3 hr) after administration. Inhibition of ACE in kidney lasted up to 48 hr after administration of ceronapril, whereas the activity of ACE in plasma and lung recovered rapidly (8 hr). In lung and plasma ACE was increased at 72 hr after administration. Therefore, induction of ACE in plasma and lung by the drug may partly obscure the acute inhibition and may contribute to the different time-course of inhibition of ACE from kidney. Ceronapril inhibited ACE in vascular organ of the lamina terminals (OVLT) and subfornical organ (SFO) of the brain slowly (onset at 8 hr) but persistently (from 24 to 48 hr). However the drug did not inhibit ACE in structures of the brain within the blood-brain barrier, such as the caudate-putamen, choroid plexus, globus pallidus, supraoptic nucleus and paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. In C.S.F. ACE was not detectably inhibited by ceronapril but was increased at 72 hr.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "277": "The bindings of perindopril and of its active metabolite perindoprilat to human serum, isolated proteins and to erythrocytes were studied by equilibrium dialysis. Within the therapeutic concentrations range, perindopril was 74% bound to serum involving a non-saturable process, NKa = 2.87. The main binders are serum albumin and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein. The serum binding of perindoprilat involved two successive steps. First, a saturable high-affinity binding (Ka: 2.8 x 10(9) M-1) occurred, involving probably the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). The second binding step was non-saturable with a very weak binding capacity, NKa = 0.15, quite superimposable to the HSA bound perindoprilat. Free fatty acids (FFA) did not alter the binding to HSA. The binding of both compounds to erythrocytes was low especially with perindopril, when measured in the presence of plasma. A significant correlation showed that the overall serum binding percentage of both drugs was essentially determined by HSA concentration. Serum binding was decreased in renal failure or cirrhosis, this result was principally linked to the hypoalbuminemia. Interactions with other drugs were limited to the binding of salicylate, tolbutamide and digitoxin to HSA.",

I.c.v. infusion of captopril at a rate of 1 microgram/microliter per h for 7 days resulted in a 60% reduction in brain ACE activity and an 80% reduction in the drinking response to i.c.v. angiotensin I. Quantitative solution hybridization experiments indicated that brain ACE mRNA levels were decreased by 40%, whereas brain A-ogen mRNA levels were unchanged. These results suggest that ACE and A-ogen mRNA levels are regulated differently in the brain than in the peripheral renin-angiotensin system.",

The combination of the two drugs accelerated the increase of active renin during the first 2 h after drug intake. Whereas no hypertensive effect could be detected after nifedipine or benazepril alone, a significant fall in systolic and diastolic blood pressure was observed for up to 9 to 12 h after the combination. The increase in heart rate induced by nifedipine was minimized by the addition of benazepril. There was no interaction between the pharmacokinetics of benazeprilate and nifedipine which would explain these pharmacodynamic effects.",

The effects of a single oral dose (10 mg) of ramipril on (a) systemic haemodynamics (arterial pressure, cardiac output), (b) carotid artery haemodynamics (blood flow and diameter, pulsed Doppler technique), (c) intracranial haemodynamics (middle cerebral artery mean blood velocity, transcranial Doppler technique), and (d) renin-angiotensin system (plasma converting enzyme and renin activities) have been investigated and compared with those of a placebo during the 24 h period following administration in a randomized, double-blind and cross-over study performed in six healthy volunteers. 2. Ramipril induced a strong and sustained inhibition of plasma converting enzyme activity (-96% at 4 h, -63% at 24 h) and an increase in plasma renin activity (+993% at 8 h). 3. As compared with placebo, ramipril did not significantly affect arterial blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac output and total peripheral resistance. 4. Ramipril significantly increased carotid blood flow (by 27% at 8 h) without significantly changing carotid artery diameter, indicating, given the unchanged arterial pressure, an arteriolar vasodilation in the carotid territory. 5. The middle cerebral artery mean blood flow velocity underwent spontaneous modifications during the placebo period but these changes were not affected by ramipril. This lack of influence of ramipril on intracranial haemodynamics suggests that the drug-induced arteriolar vasodilation and increase in carotid blood flow only concern the extracranial, musculo-cutaneous part of the carotid territory.", 
    "292": "Angioedema of the face and neck is a rare but potentially fatal complication of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) use. We retrospectively reviewed five cases of ACEI angioedema seen at our institution over the past 2 1/2 years. Four of the cases occurred with enalapril and one with lisinopril. Onset of symptoms varied from two days to ten months. Importantly, three of the five patients had been receiving medication three months or longer, suggesting clinicians must consider this complication during long-term administration of these agents. Three of the five patients were markedly obese, had a history of previous face and neck surgery, or had been intubated in the past. Thus, we propose that previous manipulation or trauma of the upper airway, perhaps resulting in airway narrowing, may represent a risk factor for upper airway obstruction secondary to ACEI-induced angioedema.",

During right- and left-sided catheterization, right atrial and left ventricular (LV) pressures, peak positive LV dp/dt, cardiac index, and plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine concentrations were measured at baseline. After a left main intracoronary infusion of dobutamine (25 to 200 micrograms.min-1), beta-adrenergic contractile responsiveness was assessed as the net increase in peak positive LV dp/dt (delta LV dp/dt). After the initial examination, patients were treated with diuretics, digitalis, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and then followed-up. After a mean follow-up period of 13 +/- 7 months, two groups of patients were distinguished: those who responded to medical therapy (group A, n = 26) and those with clinical deterioration (group B, n = 9) leading to death (n = 4) or heart transplantation (n = 5). Initial peak positive LV dp/dt, LV end-diastolic pressure, cardiac index, and LV ejection fraction were better in group A than in group B (p less than 0.001). Initial plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine concentrations were significantly higher and delta LV dp/dt was lower in group B than in group A (p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The single daily dose of captopril (30 mg/kg) produced antihypertensive response equivalent to enalapril (3 mg/kg). Chronic administration of these drugs for 2 weeks revealed that systolic blood pressure was reduced more by captopril than enalapril. We did not find differences in hypotensive activity between Enalapril IF and Renitec Merck as well as Captopril JZF Polfa and Capoten Squibb.", 
    "295": "The effect of captopril on proteinuria was evaluated in twenty patients with various glomerular diseases excreting heavy proteinuria (> 3.0 g/day). Captopril in a daily dose of 37.5 mg was administered orally three times a day to all patients and they were followed for eight weeks. Twenty-four hour urinary excretion of protein, creatinine, sodium, selective protein index (SPI), and blood chemistry including serum electrolytes were measured every two weeks. Twenty-four hour urinary protein excretion per gram creatinine started to fall within two weeks of captopril administration and became nearly stable after four weeks of therapy (p < 0.05). Mean 24-hour urinary protein excretion decreased significantly from a pretreatment value of 9.0 +/- 6.0 gm/gm of cr. to 4.4 +/- 3.5 gm/gm of cr. after eight weeks of captopril treatment. The serum albumin level increased progressively at six and eight weeks after the captopril treatment period and was significantly higher than the pretreatment value (p < 0.05). The decrease in proteinuria did not coincide with a fall in blood pressure or any changes in creatinine clearance. We conclude that captopril does have a significant antiproteinuric effect in patients excreting heavy proteinuria with various glomerular diseases. However, the long term therapeutic efficacy and any renal protective effect of this drug remain to be proven.", 
    "296": "Administration of captopril, a scavenger of oxygen derived radicals as well as an inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme, has been an efficient way of treating diabetic proteinuria. In the present study, we evaluate whether captopril can ameliorate diabetic proteinuria as an effect on oxidative stress in streptozotocin- induced diabetic rats (STZR). At four weeks after the injection of streptozotocin (50 mg/kg, i.v.), STZR (n = 5) exhibited microalbuminuria. The rate of urinary albumin excretion was 0.5 +/- 0.1 and 2.6 +/- 0.3 mg/24hr in age-matched control rats (CR; n = 5) and STZR, respectively. Compared to CR, STZR also showed an extremely increased rate of urinary lipid peroxides (LPO) excretion, an index of oxygen derived radicals generation. The respective values for CR and STZR were 0.6 +/- 0.3 and 6.9 +/- 0.6 mumol/24 hr. Significant amelioration of urinary albumin and LPO excretion rate by the treatment of insulin (2 U/day) suggests that these are associated with the diabetic state induced by streptozotocin rather than a direct effect of streptozotocin. Chronic administration of captopril, which did not cause any discernible effect on CR, significantly reduced the urinary albumin excretion rate and decreased LPO excretion in STZR. The urinary albumin excretion rate was significantly correlated with the LPO excretion rate (p = 0.0004). These results suggest that oxidative stress can be responsible for diabetic microalbuminuria, and captopril could diminish the lipid peroxidation and ameliorate the microalbuminuria in diabetic rats.", 
    "297": "The renin angiotensin system is a negative feed-back system of blood pressure control. A number of concordant experimental and clinical results indicate that the angiotensin family has a trophic effect on the vessel wall. These properties of the angiotensins favorise the proliferation of the cells which make up the vessel wall and also amplify the vascular dysfunction in the absence of the inhibitory regulations. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors could be a valuable therapeutic method of counteracting these deleterious effects on the composition and function of the vessel wall.", 
    "298": "In order to evaluate the action of captopril on left ventricular filling in hypertension, 14 hypertension (158 +/- 10/101 +/- 5 mmHg) patients aged 51 +/- 6 years were investigated by Technetium 99m gamma-angiography. The time/activity curve was used to determine the maximum filling rate (MFR) and maximum filling time (MFT) of the ventricle before and after treatment with captopril (mean dose : 44 +/- 26 mg/day for 7 months). Blood pressure was significantly lowered by treatment and there was a decrease in left ventricular mass from 128 +/- 17 to 118 +/- 15 g/m2 (p = 0.07). Maximum filling rate was accelerated by treatment from 2.27 +/- 0.57 to 2.57 +/- 0.43 VTD . s-1, p = 0.005). This variation was due essentially to half of the patients, suggesting an \"all or nothing\" type response. Maximum filling time did not vary. The basic question raised by this type of study is to know whether the improvement in the available relaxation parameter, MFR, was associated with actual improvement in filling, which is the true aim. Although the explanations offered for the observed findings are hypothetical, taking into account of all the trial data together with the morphological data provided by echocardiography suggests that captopril does have an actual and hemodynamically significant action on filling.",

The inhibition of the angiotensin converting enzyme with perindopril permitted assessment of the role of the renin-angiotensin system. In perindopril-treated guinea-pigs, the activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme was decreased by 90% with simultaneous increases in plasma renin activity and angiotensin I concentration; aldosterone and vasopressin levels, blood pressure and heart rate were not modified. Dopamine depressed mean arterial pressure by 30% and increased heart rate (8%) in controls. Dopamine infusion did not affect either plasma renin activity or angiotensin I concentration or angiotensin-converting enzyme activity in control animals. But in perindopril pretreated animals it further increased plasma renin activity (88%) and angiotensin I concentration (35%). Finally, in controls, dopamine infusion increased plasma vasopressin concentrations (91%) whereas this increase did not occur in perindopril treated animals.", 
    "300": "In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study, 24 essential hypertensive subjects were randomised to receive either placebo or 2, 4, or 8 mg perindopril. Perindopril, its deesterified metabolite, perindoprilat, and perindoprilat glucuronide were separated with an ion-exchange resin and determined by a radioimmunoassay (RIA). Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters were estimated for 96 h after the first dose and after 4-week once-daily treatment. Perindopril peak levels were achieved in less than or equal to 2 h after dosing with an elimination t1/2 of 1-2 h. Peak levels of perindoprilat were achieved more slowly, reaching a maximum level 5-8 h after dosing, and had an elimination t1/2 of 40 h. Levels of the perindopril glucuronide peaked approximately 0.5 h later than perindopril, with an elimination t1/2 of approximately 2 h. Perindopril, perindoprilat, and its glucuronide conjugate followed linear kinetics in the dose range of 2-8 mg, and there was no evidence of accumulation with chronic dosing. Perindopril 4 and 8 mg produced significant decreases in predose blood pressure (BP) with chronic dosing, with maximal decreases occurring 5-7 h after dosing. Perindopril also produced a prolonged dose-dependent inhibition of plasma angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity that was maximum after 4 h and had not fully recovered by 48 h after a single dose.", 
    "301": "We studied the hemodynamic effects of lisinopril and isosorbide-5-mononitrate in rats with permanent coronary occlusion. Rats (n = 35) underwent left coronary occlusion, and ECGs were recorded before and after occlusion. Ventricular arrhythmias were observed in 57% (20 of 35) of animals. Treatment was given immediately after coronary occlusion and for 2 subsequent days. The control group received 100 mg/kg lactose (i.e., 80% vehicle for isosorbide-5-mononitrate). Lisinopril (100 mg/kg body weight) and isosorbide-5-mononitrate (400 mg/kg body weight) reduced systolic blood pressure (SBP) from 134 +/- 9 to 115 +/- 9 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) and from 137 +/- 9 to 126 +/- 9 mm Hg, respectively; the hypotensive effect lasted 2-3 days. No effect on BP was noted in the control group. Overall mortality was 23%; 8 of 35 animals died within 10-15 min of coronary occlusion. Survival after 4 weeks was similar in each group (approximately 80%). Left ventricular pressure (LVP) was measured 4 weeks after coronary artery occlusion and was similar in each group. However, dP/dt was lower in hearts with infarction than in hearts with none (12,608 +/- 906 vs. 8,992 +/- 1,242 mm Hg/s). The extent of the infarction was the same in groups with coronary artery occlusion. Lisinopril is more effective than isosorbide-5-mononitrate in reducing BP after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Medium-term survival (4 weeks) is not jeopardized by effective treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or long-acting nitrates.", 
    "302": "Twenty-two patients with essential hypertension received a single dose of 2.5 mg cilazapril and were then randomised into a double-blind parallel group study to receive either placebo, 1.25 mg cilazapril + 0.5 mg cyclopenthiazide (CPTZ), 2.5 mg cilazapril + 0.5 mg CPTZ, or 2.5 mg cilazapril alone for 1 month. After oral administration of a single dose of 2.5 mg cilazapril, the active diacid cilazaprilat appeared rapidly in the plasma (Tmax 2.0 +/- 0.2 h). With the radioinhibitor assay used in this study, a single elimination phase of cilazaprilat was evident, with a half-life (t1/2) of 2-3 h. At steady state, the pharmacokinetics of cilazaprilat were similar to single-dose administration and were not altered by CPTZ. The Cmax and area under the curve (AUC) of cilazaprilat were directly proportional to dose. Cilazapril administration in the dose range of 1.25-2.5 mg produced a dose-proportional inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity that was maximum 2 h after drug administration. The degree of ACE inhibition correlated with the plasma concentration-time profile of cilazaprilat and the maximum decrease in blood pressure (BP). The EC50 for ACE inhibition by cilazaprilat was 7.7 ng/ml after acute treatment and was not significantly altered during chronic administration or by concomitant administration of CPTZ. There was no evidence of a dose-related antihypertensive effect of cilazapril at steady state and, with the small numbers of subjects used in this study, there was no evidence of 24-h BP control with monotherapy.", 
    "303": "The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of benazepril, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, were investigated after administration of a single oral 5-mg dose and 7 more doses on consecutive days to hypertensive patients with normal renal function (NRF) and those with impaired renal function (IRF). The antihypertensive effect of benazepril was observed as early as 30 min after a single dose, and those effects during consecutive dosing were also sustained for 24 h with a lesser diurnal variation in blood pressure (BP). The time to peak (Tmax) and the apparent elimination half-life (t1/2) for benazepril were 0.6-0.7 h and 0.4-0.8 h, respectively. Tmax for its diacid was 1.5-2.4 h in both groups. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve to 24 h (AUC0-24h) for the diacid was significantly greater in the IRF group than in the NRF group. After consecutive dosing of benazepril, AUC0-24h and plasma peak level (Cmax) were significantly increased in the IRF group. Serum ACE activity was markedly suppressed for 24 h after administration, and the inhibition was closely related to plasma diacid levels. A significant inverse correlation was observed between creatinine clearance and the AUC for the diacid. These results suggest that benazepril is rapidly bioactivated to diacid and exhibits rapid onset and long-lasting antihypertensive effects. Dosage reduction might be required to minimize unnecessary drug accumulation in patients with severe IRF.", 
    "304": "We investigated the effect of sex hormones on the sex-dependent response of rat kidney ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity to cadmium (Cd) administration and the involvement of the renin-angiotensin system in mediating stimulation of the liver enzyme by the metal. The response of renal ODC to Cd, which occurs in intact adult males but not in females, is also detectable in prepubertal and castrated males. Upon treatment with 17 beta-estradiol, the basal levels of enzyme activity in intact or castrated adult males were enhanced and Cd administration failed to increase them further. In adult females the kidney enzyme became responsive after ovariectomy. Also, in prepubertal females renal ODC was induced by Cd, and this was prevented by treatment with 17 beta-estradiol. Under the same conditions, changes in the levels of Cd accumulation within the kidney, that might account for variations in the response of ODC activity, did not occur. Cd caused an increase in renin activity starting minutes after its injection. Captopril, which specifically inhibits the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, prevented completely the induction of liver ODC by this metal; stimulation of the enzyme by Co was not affected by the drug. A similar inhibitory effect was exerted by propranolol. Adrenalectomy had no influence on the response of hepatic ODC to Cd; the decarboxylase was unaffected by aldosterone administration. It is suggested that Cd may induce liver ODC through the increase in angiotensin II following stimulation of renin by the metal.", 
    "305": "The effect on renal function of long-term treatment with either enalapril (n = 123) or placebo (n = 120) in addition to conventional therapy was studied in a randomized trial in patients with severe congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association functional class IV; the Cooperative North Scandinavian Enalapril Survival Study). Enalapril was administered in a dose of 2.5 to 40 mg/day. The analysis was restricted to the first 6 months of treatment. There was an average initial increase of 10 to 15% (10 to 20 mumol/liter) irrespective of baseline serum creatinine within the first 3 weeks of enalapril treatment, whereafter mean serum creatinine remained on a similar level during the first 6 months. Enalapril was well-tolerated by most patients, and serum creatinine was reduced in 24%. Serum creatinine increased by greater than 100% in 13 patients (11%) in the enalapril group (mainly as a consequence of intercurrent disease or severe hypotension, and usually transiently) and in 4 (3%) in the placebo group. The maximal increase in serum creatinine in the enalapril group was inversely correlated to the diastolic blood pressure (p = 0.008) at baseline and to the mean diastolic and systolic blood pressures measured at the time of the maximal increase in serum creatinine (p = 0.0001). According to multivariate regression analysis, the maximal increase in serum creatinine was also slightly influenced by the dose of furosemide taken. The development of hypotension emerged as the strongest factor explaining an abnormal increase in serum creatinine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "306": "Casual as well as ambulatory 24-hour blood pressure (BP) and echocardiographic parameters were studied in 40 patients with untreated or insufficiently treated mild to moderate essential hypertension. Left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy was assessed before and after 24 weeks of therapy with either the converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril or the calcium antagonist nifedipine. The design was a double-blind parallel study with a placebo run-in period. Patients received a daily oral dosage of either 4 to 8 mg of perindopril or 40 to 80 mg of nifedipine in slow-release form. A diuretic (25 mg/day of hydrochlorothiazide) was added in nonresponders (greater than 90 mm Hg casual diastolic BP). Once-daily perindopril and twice-daily nifedipine comparably reduced both casual and ambulatory BP throughout 24 hours (p less than 0.01) without affecting 24-hour heart rate. Six subjects withdrew from the nifedipine group and 4 from the perindopril group. After 12 and 24 weeks of therapy, LV hypertrophy was significantly reduced by both agents. Before active treatment was begun, LV mass index was more closely correlated to 24-hour (p less than 0.001) than to casual BP. This correlation disappeared after treatment with both agents. The correlation between ambulatory systolic day-time BP and LV mass was only still present (r = 0.54; p less than 0.05) after 24 weeks of treatment with nifedipine. It is concluded that regression of LV hypertrophy during converting enzyme inhibition or calcium antagonism may be partly independent of dosage and magnitude of 24-hour BP decrease.",

In order to investigate its cellular processing and its role in B lymphocyte differentiation, a fluorescent derivative of the mercapto NEP inhibitor thiorphan, N-[fluoresceinyl]-N'-[1-(6-(3-mercapto-2-benzyl-1-oxopropyl) amino-1-hexyl]thiocarbamide (FTI), has been synthesized. The fluorescent characteristics of fluorescein were conserved in FTI after linkage with the thiol NEP inhibitor. FTI inhibited NEP with an IC50 value of 10 nM and a good selectivity compared to that of aminopeptidase N (greater than 100 microM) and angiotensin converting enzyme (32 microM). The FTI probe was shown to detect membrane-bound NEP using photomicroscopy on cultured cells or flow cytometry techniques. Using NEP-expressing MDCK cells and episcopic fluorescence microscopy, a specific labeling was obtained with 100 nM FTI which was completely displaced by 10 microM HACBOGly, a specific and potent inhibitor of NEP. Therefore, FTI can be considered a suitable tool for following cellular NEP traffic. In flow cytometry, the fluorescent probe FTI, used at concentrations as low as 1 nM with Reh6 cells, could be very useful for detecting NEP/CALLA on lymphoid cells. In addition, the recognition of FTI is independent of tissues and species, a major advantage of inhibitors over monoclonal antibodies.", 
    "308": "The angiotensin II (AII) receptor antagonist, DuP 753 (10 mg/kg intraduodenal), produced a sustained and long-lasting antihypertensive effect in conscious renin-dependent hypertensive rats. Blood pressures were still reduced markedly 24 to 72 hr after administration of a single dose of DuP 753. However, pressor responses elicited by either angiotensin I or AII were not blocked at these times despite the continued antihypertensive effect of DuP 753. In a model of orthostatic hypotension, DuP 753 and the selective alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin produced a marked orthostatic hypotension response in renin-dependent hypertensive rats as demonstrated by potentiation of the decrease in blood pressure induced by a 90 degrees tilt. The nonpeptide AII receptor antagonist SK&F 108566 (10 mg/kg intraduodenal) did not produce orthostatic hypotension and the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril produced only a slight orthostatic response to tilting. In conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), allowed 3 to 4 days to recover from surgery, administration of either enalapril (1 mg/kg i.v.) or SK&F 108566 (10 mg/kg i.v.) did not significantly effect blood pressure. In SHR tested within 24 hr of surgery, enalapril was effective in lowering blood pressure. In contrast, in surgically recovered SHR, DuP 753 (10 mg/kg i.v.) produced an antihypertensive effect that was slow in onset, sustained and extremely long in duration. Blood pressures did not return to predrug levels until 48 hr after administration of DuP 753. Stimulation of the thoracolumbar sympathetic outflow in pithed rats produced frequency-dependent pressor responses that were significantly potentiated by continuous infusion of a subpressor dose of AII.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "309": "This multicentre, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study compared the antihypertensive effects of equal doses of two long-acting angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. After a two-week, placebo run-in phase, 110 patients with mild to moderate hypertension were randomised to receive 10 mg lisinopril or enalapril, or placebo for 4 weeks. Office BPs were measured at regular intervals throughout the study. Twenty-four hour ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) was measured at baseline and after the first and final doses of study drug. Serum ACE activity and aldosterone were obtained concomitantly with each ABP monitoring. Office BP differences from placebo reached (P less than 0.05) or approached (P less than 0.10) statistical significance at all observations for the lisinopril group but were not significant for any observation in the enalapril group and approached significance on two occasions. After four weeks of treatment, ABP analysis revealed that the lisinopril and enalapril groups, when compared with placebo, had similar and significant systolic and diastolic AUC reductions (P less than 0.01) from baseline over the 24 h dosing interval. During the second half of the dosing interval, 13-24 h post drug administration, the lisinopril group was significantly different from placebo (systolic BP, P = 0.002; diastolic BP, P = 0.005) while the enalapril group was not. Both drugs were well tolerated. The results indicate that monotherapy with 10 mg of lisinopril is as effective as with 10 mg of enalapril, and that ABP monitoring is useful in more precisely depicting the clinical effect of the known pharmacokinetic properties of these two agents.", 
    "310": "The renal actions of atriopeptin III were examined in anaesthetised rats at differing perfusion pressures before and following blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. At normal perfusion pressure 1000 ng kg-1 atriopeptin III caused reversible increases in glomerular filtration rate, of 20%, urine flow, absolute and fractional sodium excretions of 51-93%. Reduction of left renal perfusion pressure to 80 mm Hg decreased glomerular filtration rate by 30% and urine flow, absolute and fractional sodium excretions by 80% while atriopeptin III administration only minimally changed these variables. Concomitantly, right kidney perfusion pressure rose by 15 mm Hg which significantly increased fluid output, while the atriopeptin III induced diuresis and natriuresis were significantly larger. During infusion of captopril 900 micrograms kg-1 h-1 when pressures at the left and right kidneys had been reduced and elevated, respectively, atriopeptin III caused larger excretory responses in both kidneys which were greater than without captopril. These result suggested that the atriopeptin III mediated natriuresis and diuresis were directly proportional to perfusion pressure and attenuated by angiotensin II.", 
    "311": "To evaluate the relationship between urinary albumin excretion and left ventricular hypertrophy in essential hypertension, we studied, cross-sectionally, 64 subjects with essential hypertension and no diabetes. Urinary albumin excretion and Sokolow index correlated significantly (r = 0.483; P = 0.0001). Five subjects were positive for microalbuminuria (> 30 mg/24 h) and Sokolow index (> 35 mm); 43 were negative for both, with a concordance rate of 77 percent (chi-squared test 11.1; P = 0.0009). Stepwise multivariate regression analysis indicated two independent determinants for urinary albumin excretion: Sokolow index (F = 18.29), and diastolic blood pressure (F = 12.23). The relationships between urinary albumin excretion, Sokolow index, and blood pressure were not different in the 18 subjects taking angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitors and in the 46 others. The close relationship between urinary albumin excretion and Sokolow index observed in this study suggests that left ventricular hypertrophy due to hypertension may account for the increased cardiovascular mortality observed in non diabetic subjects with microalbuminuria.",

Studied at pH8, 35 degrees, and using N-(3-[2-furyl]-acryloyl)phe-gly-gly as substrate, the approach to steady-state activity at different substrate concentrations pointed to slow isomerizations in both EI and EIS. While an inhibitory scheme involving a single I-binding site adequately accounts for the data presented, information relating to the primary structure of ACE brings up a two-site alternative which remains to be tested.", 
    "313": "In Denmark, the total sale of medicine increased from 3.1 billion Danish crowns in 1981 to 5.9 billion Danish crowns in 1990. This increase of 91% must be seen in relation to changes in the consumer price index which increased by 77% during the same period. The greatest increase was observed in the sale of antacids and preparations for the treatment of peptic ulceration (189%), drugs for asthma (225%) and antihypertensive drugs (409%). Subdivision of the group of antihypertensive agents reveals an explosive increase in the sale of calcium-blockers (in 1990: a total of 158 million Danish crowns) and angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors (in 1990: 100 million Danish crowns). Both of these therapeutic principles had been introduced in the nineteen eighties. During the same period, slighter decreases were observed in the consumption of diuretics (194 million Danish crowns in 1990) and beta-blockers (204 million Danish crowns in 1990). This development in the sales figures documents an alteration in the patterns of prescription by practitioners. It must, however, be emphasized that the drugs mentioned here have several different therapeutic indications, some of which were first established during the above mentioned decade. No randomized investigations in the treatment of hypertension are available in which recent therapeutic principles with calcium-blockers and ACE-inhibitors were compared with the previously well tested therapeutic principles involved in diuretics and beta-blockers.",

However, important issues such as prevention of early reocclusion, prehospital administration of thrombolytics, adjunctive treatment with beta-blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and early noninvasive detection of reperfusion remained unsolved. Encouraging data have been reported in selected patients for the more aggressive approach of direct angioplasty without thrombolysis. However, the results from large, randomized trials, comparing direct angioplasty with conventional thrombolysis, are still lacking. A postthrombolysis strategy of watchful waiting has been corroborated by new findings.", 
    "315": "The effect of a 6-week treatment with the calcium channel blocker nitrendipine or the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril on blood pressure, albuminuria, renal hemodynamics, and morphology of the nonclipped kidney was studied in rats with two-kidney, one clip renovascular hypertension. Six weeks after clipping of one renal artery, hypertensive rats (178 +/- 4 mm Hg) were randomly assigned to three groups: untreated hypertensive controls (n = 8), enalapril-treated (n = 8), or nitrendipine-treated (n = 10). Sham-operated rats served as normotensive controls (128 +/- 3 mm Hg, n = 8). After 6 weeks of treatment, renal hemodynamics (glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow) were measured in the anesthetized rats. Renal tissue was obtained for determination of glomerular size and sclerosis. Enalapril but not nitrendipine reduced blood pressure significantly. After 6 weeks of therapy, glomerular filtration rate was not different among the studied groups. Renal plasma flow increased, but albumin excretion and glomerulosclerosis did not change after enalapril treatment. In contrast, in the nitrendipine-treated group albuminuria increased from 12.8 +/- 2 progressively to 163 +/- 55 compared with 19.2 +/- 9 mg/24 hr in the hypertensive controls. Furthermore, glomerulosclerosis index was significantly increased in the nitrendipine-treated group compared with the hypertensive controls (0.38 +/- 0.1 versus 0.13 +/- 0.04). In addition, glomerular size was higher in the nitrendipine-treated group (14.9 +/- 0.17 10(-3) mm2) but lower in the enalapril-treated group (11.5 +/- 0.15 10(-3) mm2) compared with the hypertensive controls (12.1 +/- 0.17 10(-3) mm2).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "316": "There is considerable interest in blood pressure reactivity to psychological stressors. Because the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin system are so responsive to stressors and are themselves the targets of many antihypertensive medications, many investigators have wondered if such medications decrease the blood pressure response to stressful stimuli. We studied 25 normotensive and 21 hypertensive men in a double-blind crossover study during which they received either placebo for 4 days or captopril (25 mg b.i.d.) for 4 days while they were hospitalized in a clinical research center. Patients were studied at resting baseline, while performing a mathematics task, and while reading out loud a disturbing newspaper article. Although captopril lowered the resting blood pressure levels, it had no effect on the amplitude of reactivity to stressors.", 
    "317": "The relation between the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) system and carbohydrate metabolism and insulin sensitivity in essential hypertension has not been investigated systematically. Twenty nondiabetic patients (age, 49 +/- 1 years; body mass index (BMI), 26.1 +/- 0.4 kg/m2) with essential hypertension (blood pressure, 155 +/- 3/105 +/- 1 mm Hg) received an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) at the end of a 1-month placebo period and again monthly during 3 months of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition (cilazapril, 5 mg/day). Furthermore, a two-step euglycemic insulin clamp was performed after placebo and again at the end of treatment. Blood pressure fell by 7 +/- 4/10 +/- 3 mm Hg (p less than 0.001), while BMI remained stable. On the euglycemic clamp, insulin-mediated (plasma insulin, 470 pM) whole body glucose use averaged 42.5 +/- 1.6 mumol.min-1.kg-1 before and 43.6 +/- 1.9 after ACE inhibition (p = NS). Substrate concentrations and oxidative rates and energy expenditure (as estimated by indirect calorimetry) were not altered by ACE inhibition, either in the fasting state or in response to insulin. In contrast, oral glucose tolerance was significantly (p less than 0.05) improved after treatment (area under OGTT curve (AUC), 240 +/- 24 versus 282 +/- 23 mmol 2 hr.l-1). The latter change was associated with enhanced (+16%, p less than 0.05) insulin responsiveness to glucose (estimated as the insulin AUC divided by the glucose AUC) throughout the 3 months of ACE inhibition. At baseline, both the OGTT and the clamp had a marked hypokalemic effect (mean decrements in plasma potassium of 0.75 +/- 0.05 and 0.92 +/- 0.05 mmol/l, respectively) in association with plasma aldosterone reductions of 30% and 50%. Chronic ACE inhibition caused a further 20% (p less than 0.03) lowering of plasma aldosterone concentrations but attenuated insulin-induced hypokalemia. Plasma sodium, which was unaltered by the pretreatment tests, fell during the posttreatment tests (by 3 mmol/l, p less than 0.001). In the urine, the ratio of the fractional excretion of potassium to that of sodium was decreased by both oral glucose (-22%, p less than 0.01) and ACE inhibition (-21%, p less than 0.001). Higher plasma potassium levels before treatment predicted a better blood pressure response to ACE inhibition (r = 0.60, p less than 0.005).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "318": "Animal studies suggest that some angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors augment endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation. We aimed to determine if captopril augments endothelium-dependent vasodilation in middle-aged hypertensive patients. By using strain-gauge plethysmography, forearm vasodilation evoked with intra-arterial acetylcholine (4, 8, 16, and 24 micrograms/min) or nitroprusside (0.2, 0.4, 0.8, and 1.2 micrograms/min) was examined before and after captopril administration (25 mg per os). Before captopril, forearm vasodilation with acetylcholine was less in hypertensive patients (n = 12) than in age-matched (n = 7) or young (n = 7) normotensive subjects, but forearm vasodilation with nitroprusside did not differ among the three groups. Captopril improved forearm vasodilation in hypertensive patients (n = 7) with acetylcholine but nitroprusside did not. In contrast, nifedipine (10 mg per os) did not alter forearm vasodilation with acetylcholine or nitroprusside in hypertensive patients (n = 5). The decreases in mean blood pressure caused by captopril and nifedipine in hypertensive subjects were comparable. Captopril did not alter forearm vasodilation with acetylcholine or nitroprusside in young normotensive subjects (n = 7). These results suggest that captopril in hypertensive patients may acutely improve impaired endothelium-dependent forearm vasodilation that does not result from reduction in blood pressure per se.", 
    "319": "The demonstration of all components of the renin-angiotensin system in vascular tissue has raised questions as to the precise location of the local angiotensin II generation within the vascular wall. We investigated the metabolism of angiotensin I to angiotensin II in the vascular wall in the isolated rabbit thoracic aorta. Angiotensin I (3 x 10(-9) M) applied into the aortic lumen was partially converted to angiotensin II (14% after 60 minutes), but most of the luminal angiotensin I was degraded to peptide fragments or diffused as intact angiotensin I, peptide fragments, or both, into the vessel wall. Incubation studies with [3H]angiotensin I revealed that angiotensin I or angiotensin I fragments mainly diffused into the medial layer of the aorta and to a lesser degree into the adventitia and the endothelium. After removal of the endothelium, angiotensin II generation could no longer be detected. Addition of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor ramiprilat (10(-7) M) to the incubation medium led to a complete blockade of angiotensin II generation by endothelial angiotensin converting enzyme. Our results underline the importance of the endothelium for conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II and provide evidence that conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II is predominantly achieved by endothelial cells. They also support the concept of an endocrine versus autocrine/paracrine renin-angiotensin system where the endothelium of the vasculature is the critical target site for angiotensin II production by both systems and, thus, the most important site for the actions of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.",

    "321": "Compared with placebo, 1 mg captopril caused nonsignificant decreases in mean arterial pressure and circulating angiotensin II level and had no effect on glomerular filtration rate as determined by 51Cr-EDTA elimination. Captopril (25 mg) produced marked suppression of serum angiotensin II with or without oral furosemide (both p less than 0.002), a marked decrease in mean arterial pressure (p less than 0.001) that was accentuated by furosemide (p less than 0.00001), and a decrease in glomerular filtration rate (p = 0.0007). No difference from placebo in renal sodium excretion was noted with either 1 or 25 mg captopril in the absence of furosemide. In contrast, while 25 mg captopril caused slight attenuation of the natriuretic response to furosemide, 1 mg captopril significantly enhanced furosemide-induced natriuresis (p less than 0.05). No correlation was found in our patients between the natriuretic effect of furosemide and either absolute mean arterial pressure or change in mean arterial pressure during the furosemide phase of each study session. This suggests that blood pressure is not the important factor mediating the divergent renal responses to furosemide of the two captopril dosage regimens.", 
    "322": "We propose that in the face of furosemide-induced postglomerular vasodilatation in chronic heart failure, captopril at a starting dose of 1 mg (but not 25 mg) preserves enough circulating angiotensin II to maintain efferent arteriolar tone and thus glomerular filtration, while offsetting the antinatriuretic renal tubular effects of angiotensin II.",

Fifty-six patients with mild to moderate heart failure underwent serial radionuclide ventriculograms, and 16 underwent serial left heart catheterizations, before and after randomization to enalapril (2.5-20 mg/day) or placebo. At 1 year, there were significant treatment differences in LV end-diastolic volume (EDV; p less than 0.01), end-systolic volume (ESV; p less than 0.005), and EF (p less than 0.05). These effects resulted from increases in EDV (mean +/- SD, 136 +/- 27 to 151 +/- 38 ml/m2) and ESV (103 +/- 24 to 116 +/- 24 ml/m2) in the placebo group and decreases in EDV (140 +/- 44 to 127 +/- 37 ml/m2) and ESV (106 +/- 42 to 93 +/- 37 ml/m2) in the enalapril group. Mean LVEF increased in enalapril patients from 0.25 +/- 0.07 to 0.29 +/- 0.08 (p less than 0.01). There was a significant treatment difference in LV end-diastolic pressure at 1 year (p less than 0.05), with changes paralleling those of EDV. The time constant of LV relaxation changed only in the placebo group (p less than 0.01 versus enalapril), increasing from 59.2 +/- 8.0 to 67.8 +/- 7.2 msec. Serial radionuclide studies over a period of 33 months showed increases in LV volumes only in the placebo group.

Both drugs lowered (p less than 0.0004) systolic and diastolic blood pressure at rest and during exercise. However, systolic blood pressure lowering during exercise was more pronounced (p less than 0.05) with nadolol than with captopril (difference of 6 mmHg, 16 mmHg, and 21 mmHg at 5.0, 7.0, and 9.0 metabolic equivalents (METS) respectively). Heart rate was lower (p less than 0.05) at rest and during exercise with nadolol as compared with placebo and with captopril.

After randomization, patients were evaluated clinically every 2 weeks during a 12-week, double-blind treatment period. Maximal exercise tolerance was measured before and at specified time points after randomization by graded treadmill exercise testing. At week 12, mean exercise time increased 95 +/- 12 (SEM) seconds in the group receiving benazepril, whereas the increase was 37 +/- 18 seconds in the group receiving placebo (p less than 0.01 for the difference between the groups). There was also greater improvement in overall clinical status and in the signs and symptoms of CHF in benazepril-treated patients than in control subjects. There were 3 deaths in placebo-treated patients and none in benazepril-treated patients (p less than 0.05); the overall incidence of adverse effects was identical in the 2 groups.

The mechanism may involve accumulation of prostaglandins, kinins (such as bradykinin), or substance P (neurotransmitter present in respiratory tract C-fibers); both bradykinin and substance P are degraded by ACE. A 4-day trial of withdrawal of the ACE inhibitor or temporary substitution of another class of antihypertensive agent inexpensively and easily ascertains if the ACE inhibitor caused the cough. Change to another ACE inhibitor or additive therapy with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is not recommended. Prompt recognition of ACE inhibitor-related cough can prevent unnecessary diagnostic testing and treatment. Angioedema occurs in 0.1% to 0.2% of patients receiving ACE inhibitors. The onset usually occurs within hours or, at most, 1 week after starting therapy. The mechanism may involve autoantibodies, bradykinin, or complement-system components. Treatment involves first protecting the airway, followed by epinephrine, antihistamines, and corticosteroids if needed. Therapy is then resumed with an alternate class of antihypertensive agent.", 
    "334": "1. We have examined the baroreceptor-heart rate (HR) reflex in weight-matched conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats during development. 2. Graded steady-state changes in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and the corresponding HR responses before and after vagal blockade with methylatropine were fitted to an S-shaped logistic function. 3. At 6 weeks of age, SHR had a 17% higher MAP than WKY and an increased baroreflex gain (slope) compared with WKY due to an increased curvature of the MAP-HR relationship. The HR range (the difference between the upper and lower HR plateaus) was similar in the two strains at this time. 4. From 9-14 weeks of age, the baroreflex gain progressively increased in WKY and decreased in SHR due to corresponding alterations in HR range. 5. By 20 weeks the baroreflex gain was 23% lower in SHR than WKY due to a 37% lower HR range. 6. There were no differences between the two strains in the sympathetic component of the baroreflex at any age, suggesting that the changes to baroreflex properties were confined to the cardiac vagus. 7. Pretreatment with enalapril from 4-9 weeks reduced the hypertension of SHR at 14 and 20 weeks by 38% and abolished all baroreceptor-HR reflex differences between the two strains. 8. These studies suggest that the major alteration to the baroreceptor-heart rate reflex in the SHR during development was a reduction in the maximum vagal capacity to respond to changes in blood pressure. This effect developed after the onset of hypertension and was prevented by antihypertensive treatment early in life. The lack of effect on the cardiac sympathetic component suggests that altered arterial baroreceptor afferents are not unlikely to be responsible.",

The effects of chronic administration of antihypertensive drugs on the vasodilator response mediated by calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-containing nerves were investigated in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). 2. A 7 week period of antihypertensive treatment with captopril, nicardipine or propranolol during the developmental phase (8-15 weeks of age) significantly lowered the mean blood pressure of SHR when compared with non-treated SHR. 3. The mesenteric vascular beds isolated from SHR, which were chronically administered with captopril, propranolol or nicardipine, were perfused with Krebs' solution containing 7 mumol/L methoxamine to produce active tone and 5 mumol/L guanethidine to block adrenergic neurotransmission. 4. In the mesenteric vascular bed with active tone, perivascular nerve stimulation (PNS; 0.5-8 Hz) caused a frequency-dependent vasodilator response that was abolished by 100 nmol/L tetrodotoxin (neurotoxin) or 1 mumol/L CGRP (8-37), a CGRP receptor antagonist. 5. CGRP-containing nerve-mediated vasodilator responses were significantly greater in captopril-treated SHR and significantly smaller in nicardipine-treated SHR than in non-treated SHR. There was no difference between the response between propranolol-treated SHR and non-treated SHR. 6. These results suggest that chronic treatment with captopril reverses the reduced neurogenic vasodilation mediated by CGRP-containing nerves in SHR.",

At steady state, blood samples were taken from the aorta and various regional veins. Distribution volume of ANG I appeared to be 24% of body weight. After angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor treatment, fractional ANG I metabolism (fraction of arterially delivered ANG I that was metabolized during a single passage of blood) was 10% in the lungs (conversion 4%), compared with 56% in the combined systemic vascular beds (conversion 1%). Fractional ANG I metabolism during ACE inhibition was 93% in the kidney; 50-70% in myocardium, skeletal muscle, head, and skin; 21% in the left cardiac cavity; and 14% in the right cardiac cavity. Without ACE inhibition, fractional ANG I metabolism was 29% in the lungs (conversion 25%); 49% in the combined systemic vascular beds (conversion 10%); 38% in the left cardiac cavity (conversion 11%); and 14% in the right cardiac cavity (conversion 0%). It may thus be concluded that 1) extrapulmonary vascular beds make an important contribution to the conversion of circulating ANG I and 2) there is rapid extrapulmonary ANG I degradation that does not depend on ANG I-II conversion.",

To determine whether specific inhibition of angiotensin (ANG) II activity would decrease albuminuria as occurs after converting enzyme inhibition, rats with passive Heymann nephritis received enalapril or the ANG II receptor antagonist losartan (6 mg.kg-1.day-1) for 4 days. Enalapril reduced both albuminuria (from 583 +/- 53 to 286 +/- 55 mg/day, P less than 0.001) and the fractional clearance of albumin (FCAlb) each day after starting treatment but did not affect glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Losartan reduced albuminuria significantly only after 4 days of treatment, but this value was not different from controls. GFR significantly increased with losartan (from 1.24 +/- 0.09 to 1.73 +/- 0.21 ml/min, P less than 0.05) so that FCAlb was reduced (from 0.0134 +/- 0.0027 to 0.0080 +/- 0.0018, P less than 0.05). Blood pressure decreased only in the enalapril group. Although plasma renin activity increased and the pressor response to ANG I was inhibited by both enalapril and losartan, suggesting effective peripheral blockade of ANG II activity, a third group of nephrotic rats was treated with losartan (18 mg.kg-1.day-1) to ensure that adequate ANG II blockade was achieved. Blood pressure decreased 10 mmHg, GFR increased from 1.35 +/- 0.14 to 1.79 +/- 0.12 ml/min (P less than 0.01), but albuminuria and FCAlb did not change.

All patients received a placebo for 1 week and then captopril, 75 mg b.i.d. for 3 months. After placebo and captopril treatments, the following parameters were evaluated: SBP, DBP, mean blood pressure (MBP), by the formula 1/3 (SBP + 2 x DBP) and basal and minimal vascular resistances, respectively obtained by the ratios MBP/rest flow and MBP/peak flow. Blood flows have been obtained by strain gauge plethysmography. A significant decrease in systolic (P less than 0.025), diastolic (P less than 0.01) and mean blood pressure (P less than 0.01), basal vascular resistances (52 +/- 19 vs 28 +/- 12 A.U., P less than 0.01) and minimal vascular resistances (6.3 +/- 2.2 vs 3.9 +/- 2.8 A.U., P less than 0.025) has been observed after captopril treatment in comparison to placebo, whereas rest (2.9 +/- 0.7 vs 4.1 +/- 0.9 ml.min-1.100 g-1, P less than 0.01) and peak blood flows (21.3 +/- 5.8 vs 29.7 +/- 9.4 ml.min-1.100 g-1) significantly increased. These data seem to indicate that antihypertensive treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, is not only efficacious in inducing a significant blood pressure decrease, consequent to the reduction of basal vascular resistance (due to the vasodilating effects of the drug), but is also able to reduce minimal vascular resistance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over; 11 patients received benazepril 10 mg b.i.d. and nine received 20 mg b.i.d. All patients had a positive treadmill stress test and at least three ischaemic episodes during 24 h of ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring. Benazepril at a dose of 10 mg b.i.d. did not improve the exercise duration, the time taken to reach 1 mm ST depression. Similar findings were observed during treatment with 20 mg b.i.d. Benazepril at a dose of 10 mg b.i.d. was ineffective in improving ischaemic parameters during daily activities. However, among the nine patients who received 20 mg b.i.d. the number of ischaemic episodes was reduced from 142 to 103, and the total duration of ischaemic was reduced from 1099 to 531 min. The number of weekly anginal attacks was reduced from 58 to 33, and the weekly sublingual nitroglycerin tablets consumption was reduced from 31 to 14. When the two doses (10 mg and 20 mg) were combined (N = 20), the number of ischaemic episodes was reduced from 314 to 260 (P = 0.074), and the duration of ischaemic was reduced from 3453 to 2514 min (P = 0.072).",

Bicycle exercise duration improved similarly with flosequinan (+27%) and enalapril (+18%); in patients completing the study, flosequinan produced a significantly greater increase in exercise time at week 12, compared with enalapril (P = 0.02). Improvements in visual analogue scores relating to general health, energy and vitality, ability to perform physical activities and breathing performance, were equivalent for both drugs. Changes in NYHA classification showed that 27 (55%) of 49 patients completing the study had improved by at least one NYHA grade (15 (68%) patients on flosequinan; 12 (44%) on enalapril). The overall safety and tolerability of the two treatments was similar; 18 patients reported adverse effects while on flosequinan, compared with 19 patients on enalapril. Neither treatment was associated with any clinically important changes in haematological or biochemical variables, although some treatment-related effects were observed. This study confirms that flosequinan achieved similar efficacy to enalapril in the symptomatic relief of chronic heart failure. The effect of flosequinan on survival in chronic heart failure has not been tested; pending such studies, our data suggest that it may prove a useful alternative therapy in patients where ACE inhibitors are contraindicated or poorly tolerated.",

Investigation revealed an intrarenal artery aneurysm involving the upper pole of the left kidney, as well as elevated levels of both renin and aldosterone. With ACE inhibitor therapy, blood pressure promptly returned to normal, and subsequent surgical removal of the upper pole of the involved kidney has resulted in normal blood pressure for 9 months of follow-up.

Compared to C, mechanics of left ventricular papillary muscles from PL exhibited a lower maximum unloaded shortening velocity (Vmax) (P less than .01) and normalized peak active force (P less than .05), and a significantly less curved shape of the force-velocity (F-V) relationship (P less than .01). The curvature of the F-V relationship has been proposed as a reflection of the efficiency of muscle contraction. Compared to PL, PE had a 68% inhibition of plasma ACE activity and a greater Vmax (P less than .05), whereas active force (AF) was similar. This resulted in a lesser decrease of the curvature of the F-V relationship compared to that of C (P less than .05). Muscle strips from the ventral costal diaphragm were dissected from the muscle in situ. In both twitch and tetanus modes, intrinsic mechanical performance of diaphragm muscle was markedly decreased in PL compared to C as regards normalized positive (+dF/dtmax/mm2) and negative (-dF/dtmax/mm2) peak rate of force, and normalized peak active force (AF/mm2) (P less than .01 each). In both twitch and tetanus modes, PE had an increased +dF/dtmax/mm2 (P less than .05), -dF/dtmax/mm2 and AF/mm2 (P less than .01 each), compared to PL. These results indicate 1) that the low inotropic state observed in cardiomyopathic Syrian hamsters was associated with decreased myothermal economy of cardiac contraction and with a major impairment of diaphragm intrinsic contractility, and 2) that early therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor helped to preserve myocardial contractility and economy, and diaphragm contractility.",

This incidence is considerably greater than listed in the Physicians' Desk Reference. Reasons for the variability in incidence as reported in the literature are explored. Clinicians must be aware of this potentially disturbing side effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors to avoid expensive and unnecessary diagnostic evaluations.",

Amino acid infusion or protein ingestion also modify renal hemodynamics and increase glomerular filtration rate (GFR). This phenomenon was used to study the influence of two commonly used antihypertensive agents, captopril and nifedipine, on renal hemodynamics at rest and during glomerular hyperfiltration. Thirteen healthy volunteers were studied on three separate days (days A, B, and C) in random sequence: inulin and p-amino hippurate (PAH) clearance were measured first under glucose infusion and afterwards under stimulation by amino acid infusion (0.35 mmol/kg/min; 4 mg/kg/min). Day A served as a control, where no medication was given. On day B, 10 mg nifedipine, and on day C, 25 mg captopril, were administered orally before study. Without premedication (= day A, control) GFR increased from 108.0 +/- 6.9 mL/min (SEM) to 131.7 +/- 7.0 mL/min (P less than 0.05). On day B (nifedipine), GFR before stimulation by amino acids was already elevated to 121.8 +/- 4.2 mL/min (P less than 0.05 compared with day A) and increased to 132.6 +/- 6.3 mL/min with infusion of amino acids, thus to the same range as on day A without medication. On day C, after captopril, GFR did not increase with infusion of amino acids (from 112.5 +/- 7.2 to 117.3 +/- 6.3 mL/min). Our results indicate the calcium channel antagonist nifedipine and the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril differ in their effect on intrarenal hemodynamic parameters.

    "346": "The effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, rampipril, captopril and enalapril, on the renal circulation and function were examined in normotensive dogs, in relation to the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (R-A-A) and kallikrein-kinin (K-K) systems and prostaglandins (PGs). These inhibitors markedly decreased renal vascular resistance (RVR) in parallel with a reduction in systemic blood pressure, and increased renal blood flow (RBF). Captopril exerted its effects rapidly, but its disappearance was also rapid. The onset of ramipril's effects was slightly delayed, but its antihypertensive and RVR-decreasing effects were fairly prolonged. Ramipril showed more potent and longer-lasting RBF-increasing effect and induced marked Na diuresis. Enalapril had no diuretic effect, and captopril's effect was only temporary. Plasma renin activity was increased similarly by the three inhibitors, but only ramipril significantly decreased plasma aldosterone concentration. This aldosterone secretion inhibition by ramipril may be partly involved in the diuretic effect. Involvement of the K-K system and PGs in ramipril's effects on the dog kidney was examined. When systemic PG biosynthesis was inhibited by indomethacin pretreatment, ramipril-induced increases in RBF and urine volume were inhibited about 50%. Inhibition of the K-K system by aprotinin pretreatment resulted in marked inhibition of urine volume increase, but scarcely affected RBF increase. These results indicate that ramipril produces the most potent effect on the renal circulation and function of the dog among the three ACE inhibitors and that its diuretic action is mostly due to kinins and kinin-induced PGs in the kidney and the RBF increase, due to the R-A-A system and PGs.",

Four days after the instillation of ferrimagnetic particles (Fe3O4, 3 mg/kg) into the lower lobe bronchus, AM were harvested by broncho-alveolar lavage. AM were adhered to the bottom of plastic vials (10(6) cells of AM per each vial). Remanent field strength (RFS) from the AM containing Fe3O4 particles was measured immediately after magnetization. RFS decreased with time due to particle rotation (relaxation), which is related to cytoplasmic motility of AM. OZ (1-500 micrograms) decreased lambda 0 (the relaxation rate for the first min) in a concentration-dependent fashion. Neither BW755C (10(-5) M), indomethacin (10(-6) M), leupeptin (10(-5) M), bestatin (10(-5) M), nor superoxide dismutase (1000 U/ml) inhibited OZ (500 micrograms)-induced inhibitory effects on lambda 0, suggesting that cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase products, serine, thiol enzymes, aminopeptidase and superoxide anion wer not responsible for OZ-induced effects. OZ (500 micrograms) significantly increased the intracellular concentration of Ca2+ (P less than 0.01). Likewise, OZ (500 micrograms)-induced effects on lambda 0 of AM were significantly inhibited by replacement of the medium with a Ca2+ free solution (P less than 0.01).

Since angiotensin II (AII) stimulates PRL release and a renin-angiotensin system is expressed in gonadotrophs, LHRH stimulation of PRL release might be mediated by AII. To evaluate this hypothesis, the influence of (Sar1,Ala8)AII and (Sar1,Ile8)AII two peptide AII receptor antagonists, of DUP753, a nonpeptide and stable AII receptor antagonist, of a converting enzyme inhibitor, and of angiotensinogen on LHRH-induced PRL release was tested in various in vitro conditions of 15- to 20-day-old female rat pituitary. In aggregates maintained in serum-free medium with or without dexamethasone (DEX) and triiodothyronine (T3), or maintained in serum-supplemented medium, the effect of LHRH on PRL release was not affected by (Sar1Ala8)AII (0.1 microM), (Sar1,Ile8)AII (10 microM) or DUP753 (10 microM). Only a high dose (10 microM) of (Sar1,Ala8)AII attenuated the LHRH-induced PRL release. The latter attenuation was seen only with aggregates cultured in the DEX/T3 medium and not with aggregates cultured in the presence of serum. A dose of 1 or 10 nM (Sar1,Ala8)AII also failed to block the effect of LHRH used at 1 nM. In contrast, (Sar1,Ala8)AII dose dependently as well as DUP753 (10 microM) abolished the AII-induced PRL release. (Sar1,Ala8)AII also failed to affect the LHRH-induced PRL release in pituitary cell aggregates from 6-week-old male rats. However, in aggregates from both immature and 6-week-old rats, (Sar1,Ala8)AII provoked a small and statistically significant attenuation of the LHRH-induced PRL release when a 100 nM dose of LHRH was used. In freshly isolated hemipituitaries from 5-day-old rats, (Sar1,Ala8)AII (1 or 10 microM) did not affect the LHRH- (10 nM) induced PRL release. In single cells obtained by redispersion of aggregates and mounted in a Biogel P2 column, LHRH still stimulated PRL release. Again this effect could not be blocked by DUP753. Treatment of aggregate cell cultures with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril or with angiotensinogen did not alter the LHRH-induced PRL release. It is concluded that AII is not the paracrine factor mediating the effect of LHRH at low nanomolar doses on PRL release, at least not through the classical AII receptor. The involvement of AII acting on a non-(Sar1,Ala8)AII-sensitive receptor cannot be excluded and warrants further investigation.", 
    "372": "To verify the hypothesis that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors possess a unique renoprotective effect in progressive chronic renal disease, we decided to compare the effects of an ACE inhibitor and a calcium antagonist on both hypertension and the progression of non-diabetic renal insufficiency in a long-term study. A four-year, multicenter, prospective, randomized trial was conducted on 142 hypertensive patients (pts) with established chronic renal failure from six Italian nephrology departments. They were on standard antihypertensive therapy with a low-protein diet and underwent twice-monthly surveillance for a one year pre-randomization period. After that year, 121 pts were randomly allocated to captopril or slow-release nifedipine therapies for a three-year study period. The progression of renal insufficiency was monitored every two months. Blood pressure control was significantly better after randomization than during the year of standard antihypertensive therapy. The progression rate before randomization (BR) was definitely higher before than after randomization (AR): Creatinine clearance (CCr) change BR = -0.46 +/- 0.45 ml/min/month, creatinine clearance change AR = -0.23 +/- 0.43 ml/min/month (P less than 0.01). After randomization, the mean blood pressure values were virtually the same throughout the three year period of the study in the two groups treated by captopril (group I), or nifedipine (group II).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "373": "Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) are believed to protect remnant kidney, but all previous studies used the ligation model which causes severe hypertension, and very few have compared drugs in rats having similar control of blood pressure (BP). We compared rats with uremia obtained by 70% excision of total renal mass, a model which causes mild, late hypertension. Study I compared the effects of enalapril (E), cicletanine (C) and placebo (P) in uremic (U) rats fed a 0.50% (normal-high) Na diet. Study II compared the effects of E, C, P, and guanfacine (G) in U rats fed a diet restricted to 0.25% Na (normal-low). In study I, UP rats developed progressive hypertension (140, 146, 160 and 166 mm Hg at 3, 6, 9 and 12 weeks), proteinuria (240 mg/day at 9 and 12 weeks) which were not affected by E or C. The occurrence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) led to the sacrifice of all rats after three months. All three groups had similar severe renal lesions (over 25% sclerosed glomeruli in 5 of 10 UP, 9 of 14 UE, 7 of 14 UC rats, with huge cystic tubular dilatations). In study II, rats could be sacrificed later (6 months) and had evidence of less severe renal disease. All the drugs tested prevented hypertension throughout the study (P less than 0.001), with lowest values in UE rats. E and G, but not C, reduced proteinuria. Renal damage was reduced with E and G, but not with C, despite similar BP in C and G rats. Thus, in contrast with what was obtained in the ligation model, ACEI affected neither the BP nor the renal lesions of rats made uremic by renal excision and fed a 0.50% Na diet. Moderate Na restriction improved the consequences of nephron loss and restored the anti-hypertensive effect of drugs. However, these drugs had a different effect on renal preservation: it was dramatic with E, good with G, and undetectable with C.", 
    "374": "Total neopterin (T-N), a by-product in the biopterin biosynthesis and an indicator of activation of the cellular immune system, and total biopterin (T-B) levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), were measured in patients with various inflammatory neurological diseases and Parkinson's disease, and the following results were obtained. (1) In patients with neuro-sarcoidosis, neuro-Beh\u00e7et's disease and meningitis, CSF T-N levels were markedly elevated in the exacerbation or acute stages of their neurological symptoms and remarkably decreased in the remission or chronic stages. In the neuro-sarcoidosis and neuro-Beh\u00e7et's disease patients, however, CSF T-B levels showed no substantial change. (2) There was a significant positive correlation between CSF T-N levels and CSF/serum albumin ratios only in the meningitis patients. However, increases of CSF T-N levels were not associated with those of plasma T-N levels. (3) In the Parkinson's disease patients, CSF T-N levels remained normal, although CSF T-B levels significantly decreased. (4) A gradient for the CSF T-N value (lumbar greater than ventricular CSF), being reverse to the CSF T-B value, was observed. These results indicate that the significance of CSF T-N is quite different from CSF T-B, and that CSF T-N appears to be a valuable biochemical marker for evaluating the activity of inflammation within the central nervous system. Its measurement seems useful for therapeutic monitoring, especially of patients showing the chronic exacerbating-remitting course.", 
    "375": "Rat gene for renin-binding protein (RnBP) was shown to be expressed in the kidney, adrenal gland, brain, lung, spleen, ovary, testis, and heart. On sodium depletion and captopril administration, the rat showed a marked increase in the adrenal RnBP mRNA level and a slight decrease in the kidney RnBP mRNA level. In two-kidney, one clip hypertensive rats, the RnBP mRNA levels of the clipped and contralateral kidneys were unchanged and also its adrenal mRNA level was maintained at the control level. The recombinant rat RnBP was synthesized in Escherichia coli cells and purified to apparent homogeneity. The RnBP existed as a homodimer and formed a heterodimer with rat renin to inhibit renin activity extensively. Intravenous injection of the RnBP into rats resulted in a rapid and strong inhibition of plasma renin activity, which persisted at least for 2 h. These results suggest that the expression of RnBP gene in the kidney and adrenal gland is regulated independently, and the function of RnBP is related to electrolyte homeostasis, probably through the interaction with renin.", 
    "376": "1. We have studied the contractile activity of the 39 amino acid precursor of endothelin-1 (ET-1), big endothelin-1 (big ET-1), on human isolated bronchi. The contribution of the metalloproteases, neutral endopeptidase (NEP) and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), in the presence or absence of the epithelium lining, by use of specific inhibitors, was also evaluated on the effects of big ET-1. 2. Big ET-1 elicited a potent contraction of human isolated bronchus. The -log EC50 value for big ET-1 was 7.53 +/- 0.08 (n = 11) and Emax 78.5 +/- 3.8% (% of ACh 3mM). 3. Incubation of human isolated bronchi with the NEP inhibitor phosphoramidon (10(-5) M) induced a rightward shift of the concentration-response curve induced by big ET-1 (10(-9) M to 3 x 10(-7) M). Similar results were observed when human bronchi were incubated with thiorphan (10(-5) M), but the shift to the right was significantly less (P less than 0.01) than that observed in the case of phosphoramidon (-0.35 +/- 0.05 vs -0.67 +/- 0.07 log unit). 4. The two inhibitors of angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE), captopril or enalapril diacid, did not affect the concentration-response curve for contraction induced by big ET-1. 5. When the epithelium was removed, a leftward shift of the concentration-response curve of big ET-1 (10(-9) M to 3 x 10(-7) M) was observed. Incubation of human isolated bronchi with phosphoramidon or thiorphan (10-5M) or with enalapril diacid or captopril did not modify the leftward shift of the concentration-response curve for big ET-1 after epithelium removal.6. These results suggest that big ET-1 elicits potent contractile activity in the human isolated bronchus and that its effect is the consequence of the conversion to ET-1 by a phosphoramidon-sensitive metalloprotease which, although different from NEP and ACE, appears to be similar to the endothelinconverting enzyme (ECE) described in other studies in animals.", 
    "377": "Patients with hypertension tend to be glucose intolerant, hyperinsulinemic, and dyslipedemic. Since all of these changes increase risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), it is important to know what effect antihypertensive treatment has on these variables. The current open-labelled, uncontrolled study was initiated in order to extend our understanding of these issues. This study was performed in 19 patients with hypertension who were started on an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitor, cilazapril, with hydrochlorothiazide (HC) added if needed to control blood pressure. Plasma glucose and insulin responses to oral glucose and lipid concentrations were measured before, 26, and 52 weeks after starting treatment. Patients treated with either cilazapril (n = 9) or cilazapril+HC (n = 10) did not differ in terms of original (mean +/- SEM) blood pressure (159 +/- 5/101 +/- 1 v 156 +/- 4/103 +/- 2 mm Hg), age (53 +/- 2 v 54 +/- 2 years), sex distribution (5M:4F v 7M:3F), or body mass index (24.4 +/- 0.5 v 24.2 +/- 0.9 kg/m2).

Plasma glucose and insulin responses decreased by 8 +/- 3% (P less than .05) and 25 +/- 9% (P less than .002), respectively, in cilazapril-treated patients, but did not change in those treated with cilazapril plus HC.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "378": "Recent studies have suggested the beneficial effects of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors against myocardial ischemic-reperfusion injury. This study was designed to compare the cardioprotective effects of two sulfhydryl ACE inhibitors, captopril and zofenopril, with those of a nonsulfhydryl ACE inhibitor, fosinopril. The efficacy of these ACE inhibitors to scavenge oxygen radicals in vitro were also examined. Isolated rat hearts perfused by the Langendorff technique were preperfused in the presence or absence of ACE inhibitors (50 microns for 15 minutes, and the hearts were then subjected to 30 minutes of ischemia followed by 30 minutes of reperfusion. Zofenopril and captopril, but not fosinopril, improved postischemic left ventricular functions and reduced myocardial cellular injury, as evidenced by improved recovery of the first derivative of left ventricular pressure development and reduced creatine kinase release compared with control (p less than .05). Coronary flow was significantly increased by captopril and zofenopril only. The same two drugs also inhibited the enhanced lipid peroxidation during reperfusion. Although significant differences were not noticed in the postischemic myocardial membrane phospholipid composition, captopril and zofenopril reduced nonesterified fatty acid contents, including palmitic, linoleic, oleic, and arachidonic acids. In vitro studies demonstrated that captopril and zofenopril were able to scavenge hydroxyl radicals. These results indicate that among three ACE inhibitors, two sulfhydryl-containing drugs, captopril and zofenopril, possess cardioprotective as well as free-radical scavenging abilities. Attenuation of phospholipid degradation and lipid peroxidation may be contributory to the protective effects observed in this study.",

Findings of clinical, histologic, and immunofluorescence testing were consistent with a diagnosis of pemphigus vegetans. In addition, Charcot-Leyden crystals were observed within some of the intraepidermal, eosinophilic abscess cavities, which were bordered by granular cells undergoing keratinization. The skin lesions cleared rapidly after discontinuation of captopril. To the best of our knowledge, this report describes the first case of pemphigus vegetans induced by captopril.", 
    "380": "We examined the influence of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) on mortality in patients with heart failure of both ischaemic or non-ischaemic origin. Eleven, randomized, placebo-controlled trials of ACE inhibitors involving 1266 patients were selected. The follow-up period varied from 3 to 6 months. Four different ACE inhibitors were used in the 11 clinical trials. A total of 679 patients presented with an ischaemic heart failure and 587 with a non-ischaemic heart failure. Meta-analysis, performed for both subgroups, showed that mortality was significantly decreased in the ischaemic subgroup only (ischaemic group: odds ratio 0.45; 95% confidence interval 0.28 to 0.71; non-ischaemic subgroup: odds ratio 0.7; 95% confidence interval 0.4 to 1.5). Although the two odds ratio are not significantly different, further randomized, placebo-controlled trials with ACE inhibitors are required in order to determine more precisely the benefit/risk ratio in patients with non-ischaemic heart failure.", 
    "381": "Left ventricular hypertrophy is more common in hypertensive individuals than in normotensive persons. Its presence in hypertensive patients is associated with an increased incidence of ventricular arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, stroke and cardiovascular mortality. Echocardiography is more sensitive than electrocardiography in detecting left ventricular hypertrophy. Echocardiographic evidence of this condition in patients with borderline hypertension may identify those who need treatment. Weight reduction and drug therapy can prevent or reverse ventricular hypertrophy in hypertensive patients. Recent studies suggest that some antihypertensive drugs are more effective than others in reducing left ventricular hypertrophy. These agents include beta-adrenergic blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers and sympatholytic agents. Although little evidence exists to show that reduction of left ventricular mass decreases cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, avoidance of antihypertensive agents that may aggravate hypertrophy would seem prudent.",

    "383": "Substantial removal of the vasoconstrictor peptide endothelin-1 (ET-1) by the pulmonary circulation has been reported to occur in perfused guinea pig and rat lungs. We examined the uptake of ET-1 by coronary and pulmonary circulations of the rabbit by measuring single-pass extraction of ET-1 in the isolated heart and lung. In separate experiments, each organ was perfused at 30 ml/min with Krebs-albumin (3%) solution. A bolus of 125I-ET-1 and [14C]dextran in 0.3 ml Krebs-albumin solution was injected, and extraction of endothelin (EET), relative to that of an intravascular reference indicator, [14C]dextran, was determined by multiple indicator-dilution technique. EET was 5 +/- 2% (SE) in the heart and 49 +/- 4% in the lung. Increasing flow rate in the lung preparation to approximate the mean transit time in the heart preparation did not significantly alter EET. Despite insignificant uptake of ET-1, the coronary circulation extracted an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (351A) and metabolized a synthetic angiotensin-converting enzyme substrate (benzoyl-phenyl-alanyl-proline), both properties of the normal pulmonary circulation. We therefore conclude that there is no significant ET-1 uptake in the coronary vascular bed.", 
    "384": "Haemodynamic comparison of three vasodilation regimens [intravenous (i.v.) hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) combined, i.v. doxazosin, and i.v. enalaprilat] was undertaken in 36 patients with acute left ventricular (LV) failure due to recent myocardial infarction. Each regimen achieved similar reductions in pulmonary artery occluded pressure (PAOP, preload) and systemic arterial pressures (afterload), with increased cardiac and stroke volume (SV) indexes (p less than 0.01). Only the hydralazine and isosorbide combination induced resting tachycardia. Balanced vasodilatation after selective alpha-adrenoceptor blockade (doxazosin) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition (enalaprilat) without increase in heart rate (HR) suggests that these therapies may have definite haemodynamic advantages over the hydralazine/ISDN combination.", 
    "385": "The antihypertensive and hemodynamic effects of lisinopril and atenolol were evaluated in 21 patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. Left ventricular systolic and diastolic performances were assessed prior to and following treatment by first-pass radionuclide cineangiography at rest and during peak upright bicycle exercise. Both lisinopril and atenolol treatment significantly reduced the blood pressure. Lisinopril therapy was associated with a reduction in systemic vascular resistance and left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes but no change in stroke volume, cardiac output, peak ejection rate, peak filling rate, time to peak ejection rate, or time to peak filling rate. In contrast, atenolol therapy was associated with an increase in end-diastolic volume and stroke volume but no change in cardiac output; the left ventricular peak ejection and peak filling rates were decreased by atenolol treatment. Although both lisinopril and atenolol each significantly reduced the blood pressure, lisinopril had no effect on left ventricular systolic or diastolic performance; in contrast, atenolol decreased both systolic and diastolic parameters of ventricular performance. Left ventricular function may be affected in significantly different ways despite apparent similarities in blood pressure control in patients who respond to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition or beta-adrenergic receptor blockade. Differences in hemodynamic response to an antihypertensive agent may be important in the selection of a drug for the treatment of subsets of patients with cardiac function abnormalities.",

In the ACE group, despite a tendency towards improvement, glucose uptake during the euglycaemic insulin clamp procedure did not change significantly from the baseline value of 4.0(0.5-12.9) mg/kg/min, values at 6 and 12 months being 4.8(1.3-14.7) and 4.4(1.5-9.8) mg/kg/min, respectively: the corresponding values for the beta group were 4.2(1.1-15.3), 3.6(1.2-8.9) and 4.0(1.5-12.0) mg/kg/min. The 22Na efflux rate constant, both baseline and follow-up values, was similar in both groups, and unrelated to insulin sensitivity. Owing to the surprisingly great variation in peripheral glucose uptake, the subgroup with values below the median for the population as a whole (4.9 mg/kg/min) was evaluated separately: those switched to captopril treatment manifested a 60% improvement in glucose disposal at 6 months and persisting at 12 months, the respective values being 2.1(0.5-4.8) (baseline), 3.5(1.3-6.3) and 3.4(1.5-6.1) mg/kg/min, (P = 0.012).

The purpose of the present study was assessment of the effect of hydrochlorothiazide in 50 mg daily doses on blood levels of kininogen and prekallikrein and on plasma renin activity (PRA) in hypertensive patients treated during captopril 150 mg daily alone during 3 weeks, without success. The study was carried out on 15 patients with essential hypertension stage III after WHO. A control group comprised 18 healthy subjects. The determinations were done three time: before treatment, after 3 weeks on captopril, and after 2 weeks of combined treatment with captopril and hydrochlorothiazide. It was found combined treatment with captopril and hydrochlorothiazide produced blood pressure normalization in patients insufficiently responding to captopril alone. During the combined treatment normalization of blood pressure was associated with a higher fall of kininogen concentration, higher rise of prekallikrein and PRA in relation to the values obtained with captopril alone. This evidenced a more pronounced reaction of the kinin system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system to the combined treatment as compared with the response of both systems to captopril alone.", 
    "394": "To study the effects of angiotensin (ANG) peptides on airway epithelial ion transport function, we evaluated the bioelectric properties of canine cultured tracheal epithelium under short-circuit conditions in vitro. Addition of ANG I, II and II dose-dependently increased short-circuit current (Isc) and transepithelial potential difference, an effect that was more pronounced with addition to the submucosal solution than to the mucosal solution, with rank order of potency of ANG II greater than or equal to ANG II much greater than ANG I. The ANG-induced increase in Isc was not altered by the Na channel blocker amiloride, but was greatly reduced by the CI channel blocker diphenylamine-2-carboxylate and Cl-free medium. The response of Isc to ANG I was reduced by MK422, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, in a dose-dependent fashion. These results suggest that ANG II and III selectively stimulate Cl secretion across airway epithelium and that ANG I may exert its effect after its conversion to ANG II by angiotensin converting enzyme.", 
    "395": "The role of NO-formation induced by accumulated endogenous bradykinin (BK) via local ACE-inhibition with ramiprilat (RT) or by adding BK exogenously was evaluated in cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) and in isolated rat hearts with post-ischaemic reperfusion injuries. Furthermore we used the n-octyl-ester of ramipril (RA-octil) which was shown to have no ACE-inhibitory action. In BAEC, ACE-inhibition by RT (1 x 10(-8)-1 x 10(-6) mol/l) or addition of BK (1 x 10(-8)-1 x 10(-6) mol/l) stimulated the formation of NO and prostacyclin (PGI2) as assessed by endothelial cyclic GMP- and 6-keto-PGF1a formation. Cyclic GMP and PGI2 synthesis was completely suppressed by the NO synthase inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA, 1 x 10(-5) mol/l) and by the B2 kinin receptor antagonist HOE 140 (1 x 10(-7) mol/l). RA-octil (1 x 10(-8)-1 x 10(-4) mol/l) did not affect endothelial cyclic GMP production in BAEC. In isolated working rat hearts subjected to local ischemia with reperfusion both RT (1 x 10(-8) mol/l) and BK (1 x 10(-9) mol/l) reduced the incidence and duration of ventricular fibrillation. In parallel myocardial function (left ventricular pressure, coronary flow) and metabolism (high energy rich phosphates) were improved showing a comparable fingerprint for RT and BK. Addition of L-NNA (1 x 10(-6) mol/l) or HOE 140 (1 x 10(-9) mol/l) abolished these protective effects of RT and BK. As in the BAEC studies RA-octil was without beneficial effects on the isolated ischaemic rat heart. The findings on BAEC show that inhibition of ACE localized on the luminal side of the vascular endothelium results in increased synthesis of NO and prostacyclin by local accumulation of endothelium-derived BK.

Following a two-week run-in period, patients with a lying DBP between 95 mmHg and 115 mmHg were randomised to either lisinopril 10 mg or placebo once daily for four weeks. Blood pressure measurements were made approximately 24 h after the previous dose of study medication. After four weeks' treatment the dose of study medication was doubled for those patients whose lying DBP was greater than or equal to 90 mmHg and a final assessment was made after a further two weeks of treatment. Overall, six weeks' treatment with lisinopril produced a greater fall in lying blood pressures than placebo when added to atenolol therapy. The difference in favour of the additional ACE inhibitor therapy was 7.1 +/- 2.6/5.4 +/- 1.5 mmHg (mean +/- SEM) (P less than 0.01). Standing blood pressures showed similar behaviour in favour of the additional ACE inhibitor treatment (7.6 +/- 2.4/4.7 +/- 1.6 mmHg) (P less than 0.005). Heart rate was not altered significantly by either lisinopril or placebo treatment. The addition of lisinopril to treatment with atenolol produced a slight increase in the reported number of adverse events compared with placebo. The results of this study indicate that the addition of lisinopril 10-20 mg once daily to treatment with a beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug produces a worthwhile decrease in blood pressure in patients not responsive to beta-blocker therapy alone.", 
    "397": "Experiments were performed in vivo and in vitro to determine the effects of enalaprilat, a specific inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme, on various aspects of the decidual cell reaction in rats. Ovariectomized, adult female rats were sensitized for the decidual cell reaction with steroid treatments. For in vivo experiments, intrauterine infusions of enalaprilat alone, and in combination with angiotensin II and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), were initiated on the day of uterine sensitivity. Enalaprilat inhibited the increases in uterine PG concentrations, endometrial vascular permeability, alkaline phosphatase activity and uterine weight that occurred sequentially following infusion of vehicle. Concurrent infusion of angiotensin II did not reverse any of these inhibitory effects; PGE2 infusion partially, but not completely, reversed the inhibition of increase in uterine weight, although it did not alter the inhibition of endometrial vascular permeability. For in vitro experiments, endometrial stromal cells were obtained from uteri on the day of sensitivity and cultured for up to 3 days in the presence of enalaprilat and angiotensin II. Enalaprilat inhibited in a dose-dependent manner the increases in stromal cell alkaline phosphatase activity and media PGE concentration that occurred in the control cultures; these effects were fully reversed by concurrent treatment with angiotensin II. The inhibition of stromal alkaline phosphatase activity was also reversed by PGE2; conversely, the ability of angiotensin II to reverse the effect of enalaprilat was lost in the presence of indomethacin. These studies provide evidence of a requirement for angiotensin II during the decidual cell reaction in rats and suggest that it acts, at least in part, through a PG-dependent mechanism.",

The aim of this study was to examine the effect of captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, on plasma levels of human brain natriuretic peptide-like immunoreactivity (hBNP-li) in patients with congestive heart failure. 2. Six male patients (aged 52-74 years) with mild to moderate congestive heart failure were studied on two occasions in the semi-recumbent position. After a 30 min rest, patients were randomized to receive oral tablets of either captopril (6.25 mg followed by 25 mg 2 h later) or placebo in a single-blind manner. Plasma hBNP-li, atrial natriuretic peptide-like immunoreactivity (ANP-li) and angiotensin II-like immunoreactivity (ANG II-li) levels and blood pressure were measured. 3.

    "400": "Interactions between angiotensin II and adrenoceptor-mediated effects on peripheral sympathetic neurotransmission were investigated in constant flow blood-perfused canine gracilis muscle in situ, without and with pretreatment by non-competitive alpha-adrenoceptor blockade. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibition by benazeprilat increased nerve stimulation (2 Hz, 4 min)-evoked noradrenaline (NA) overflow (+ 21 +/- 5%) with alpha-adrenoceptors intact, but reduced NA overflow (- 18 +/- 6%) when alpha-adrenoceptors were blocked. Vasoconstrictor responses were slightly reduced by benazeprilat. Subsequent infusion of angiotensin II (Ang II, 20 and 500 ng kg-1 min-1 i.v., raising arterial concentrations from 0.6 +/- 0.2 pM to 1390 +/- 240 and 25,110 +/- 3980 pM, respectively) failed to increase NA overflow or to enhance stimulation-evoked vasoconstriction. Adrenaline (0.4 nmol kg-1 min-1 i.v.) did not change evoked NA overflow before or after benazeprilat, either with or without alpha-adrenoceptor blockade, despite high concentrations (approximately 10 nM) in arterial plasma. Following benazeprilat, propranolol reduced NA overflow (- 24 +/- 3%) only if the alpha-adrenoceptors were blocked. In conclusion, benazeprilat reduced evoked NA overflow in the presence of alpha-adrenoceptor blockade to a similar degree as previously shown in the presence of neuronal uptake inhibition in this model. However, contrasting to our previous findings, benazeprilat enhanced NA overflow and reduced the post-junctional response to nerve stimulation in the absence of alpha-adrenoceptor blockade. This could be related to bradykinin accumulation during ACE-inhibition, in addition to the reduction of Ang II generation. Our data are not compatible with facilitation of NA release by circulating Ang II even at pharmacological dose levels. Although activation of prejunctional beta-adrenoceptors may facilitate evoked NA overflow in this model, circulating adrenaline is ineffective under physiological conditions even after alpha-adrenoceptor blockade. Also, beta-adrenoceptor-mediated prejunctional effects do not seem to involve Ang II in canine skeletal muscle in vivo.", 
    "401": "1. To examine the effect of chronic administration of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor on circulating angiotensin II (AII) concentration, 20 mg of lisinopril was administered once daily for 7 consecutive days to eight healthy volunteers. 2. Plasma ACE activity was inhibited to less than approximately 30% of the pretreatment level during the repeated administration. 3. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was slightly but significantly reduced during the administration period. Plasma AII concentration measured by an established method using high performance liquid chromatography combined with a radioimmunoassay, however, was maintained at approximately the pretreatment level when it was measured at 24 h intervals after each administration of lisinopril. 4. With the gradual recovery of ACE activity following discontinuation of administration, the plasma AII concentration correlated with AI concentration (r = 0.46), and also with the product of AI and ACE activity (AI x ACE; r = 0.80), corresponding to the formula obtained from the kinetics of ACE activity. No correlation was observed between MAP and AII levels throughout the study period. 5. We conclude that in normal subjects repeatedly administered with ACE inhibitor, the AII level in the circulation is still determined by an elevated level of AI and any remaining ACE activity, thus maintaining AII at pretreatment levels. We confirmed that it is not necessary to achieve a decrease in plasma AII concentration through the chronic administration of ACE inhibitor in order to effectively lower blood pressure.",

Nitrendipine 20 mg o.d. and lisinopril 20 mg o.d. were given in a randomized order during a period of each 8 weeks. Nitrendipine and lisinopril decreased systolic and mean arterial blood pressure to a similar level without a significant increase in heart rate. The mean diastolic blood pressure was smaller with the lisinopril treatment than with the nitrendipine treatment. The blood pressure decrease was maintained in the sitting and standing position. Furthermore, only nitrendipine decreased the pulsatility index at the tibial posterior arteries, while lisinopril did not influence it significantly. This finding means that mechanisms other than the blood-pressure lowering effect are involved in the decrease of the pulsatility index.",

At the end of dosing interval angiotensin II had returned to values seen under placebo with the 12.5-mg dose, but at the end of the 24-h period it was still suppressed with the 25-mg dose. Compared with these first-dose responses the initial maximal degree of angiotensin II suppression after 2 weeks administration of either dose was similar, but during the subsequent hours the degree of angiotensin II suppression tended to be less with the lower and was significantly less with the higher dose of spirapril.

Autoradiographic study of renal ACE using 125I-Ro 31-8472 or 125I-351A showed the same distribution of radioligand binding across kidney sections and identical radioligand binding for purified lung and testis ACE by Western blot, confirming that the same protein bound both radioligands. Analysis of displacement of 125I-Ro 31-8472 binding from ACE by ACE inhibitors 351A and lisinopril yielded biphasic curves for pulmonary, renal, and plasma ACE and a monophasic curve for ACE from the testis. Analysis by LIGAND suggested two binding sites in ACE from plasma or somatic sources and one binding site in ACE of testicular origin, as predicted by molecular biology studies. Displacement of 125I-351A binding from lung and testis ACE by Ro 31-8472 and 351A was monophasic.

Previous studies on general populations had established a dogma: most of the major body functions, such as cardiac output, glomerular clearance, muscular strength, visual acuity and so forth, were supposed to decline with age. However, in recent studies on the effects of age on cardiac output all subjects with heart disease were excluded and as a result the negative correlation found between cardiac output and age disappeared, which shows that a phenomenon attributed to ageing was in fact caused by disease. This does not mean that there is no such thing as fundamental ageing, and indeed the mechanisms that maintain cardiac output are different in young and elderly subjects. These data are of more than theoretical interest, since it may be presumed that prevention, the instruments of which are already available in some fields, will modify the profile of ageing. The risk of arterial hypertension is not restricted to the classical cardiovascular diseases: it extends to other diseases, such as vascular dementia, which are potent factors of pathological ageing.

    "440": "Ageing of the kidneys has long been associated with a fall in the number of functioning nephrons resulting in a reduction of renal blood flow and glomerular filtration. This narrow concept of age-related changes in renal function has been developed chiefly during the last few years by Brenner et al. on the basis of experimental studies conducted on rodents. According to these authors, the size and frequency of segmental and focal lesions of glomerulosclerosis increase regularly with age, and in its final phase this pathology results in occlusion of glomerular capillaries. Renal ageing, therefore, can be assimilated to the nephron reduction models obtained by surgical ablation. The hypothesis that hypofiltration in certain nephrons is compensated by hyperfiltration in healthy glomerulis, leading to a vicious circle of self-destruction, was then applied to both ageing and experimental renal impairment: the smaller the number of nephrons, the greater the filtration achieved by the remaining nephrons, a process that accelerates the probability of their destruction. Conversely, any attempt to reduce intracapillary pressure or glomerular filtration slows down the progression of renal failure. This hypothesis is supported by experiments showing that reduction of protein intake or chronic inhibition of angiotensin I-converting enzyme activity are truly capable of limiting the progression of glomerulosclerosis induced in rats by partial renal mass ablation. Similarly, prolonged food restriction increases the life expectancy of rodents and almost totally prevents the occurrence of glomerulosclerosis. The experimental finding that degenerative renal lesions do not necessarily develop with age raises the problem of normal and pathological ageing. With an adequate choice of rats' food, strain and sanitary surroundings it is possible to obtain very old animals devoid of occluded glomerular capillaries and loss of nephron. What about the functional and structural changes due to ageing and not to pathology? This question has given rise to numerous studies which concluded, on the whole, that there exists a normal ageing of the kidneys without loss of nephron and that ageing is expressed by the fact that the kidneys have difficulties in adjusting themselves to disturbances in the inner environment. As regards renal functional reserve, response to the antidiuretic hormone in case of water restriction, or stimulation of the renin-angiotensin system in response to decrease of sodium intake, it is clear that the renal cells responsible for glomerular filtration, tubular transport or synthesis and release of peptidic hormones exhibit functional alterations that are age-related. The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying these physiological changes are little known.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "441": "In subjects without cardiovascular or neuronal diseases ageing does not seem to be accompanied by a significant fall in global cerebral blood flow at rest. Yet non-negligible changes in cerebral blood flow rate can be demonstrated by haemodynamic or metabolic stimuli. Several intra- and extracranial vascular mechanisms may be involved in these changes. During ageing, a decrease of carotid artery compliance due to parietal calcium deposition might be an important factor in the disturbance of cerebral blood flow regulatory mechanisms.",

    "453": "Neutral endopeptidase (NEP; enkephalinase, EC 3.4.24.11) is a cell membrane-associated zinc metalloprotease, which cleaves peptides like atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) on the amino side of hydrophobic amino acids. Although NEP is mainly located in reabsorptive epithelia (kidney proximal tubule), it is also present in non-epithelial cells such as neuronal cells. As the renal NEP cannot account for the entire ANP metabolism, other locations were postulated. The present experiments show its expression in endothelial cells (EC) from arterial (bovine pulmonary, porcine, and human aorta) and venous (human umbilical, rabbit ear marginal) origins. Three different methods were used to demonstrate the presence of the protein and its mRNA. 1) NEP enzymatic activity was estimated using both a synthetic ([D-Ala2,Leu5]enkephalin) and a natural substrate (bradykinin). Using the synthetic substrate, the enzymatic activity in EC was completely blocked by thiorphan, a specific NEP inhibitor with an IC50 value in the nanomolar range. In contrast, captopril, bestatin, [2-guanidinoethylmercapto]succinic acid, inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme, aminopeptidases, and carboxypeptidases, respectively, were 10,000 times less active, revealing an inhibition profile similar to that of the purified enzyme. Bradykinin, a natural substrate of NEP, was in part metabolized by NEP, in the presence of captopril, since 50% of the formation of the major metabolite bradykinin 1-7 was inhibited by thiorphan. 2) Immunoreactive NEP was detected on the plasma membrane of rabbit EC using a monoclonal antibody directed against the homologous renal enzyme. 3) NEP mRNA was detected by Northern blot analysis of rabbit EC as a major transcript of 3.9 kilobases. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction amplification showed the presence of a specific transcript in all EC tested. Therefore, endothelial NEP may play an important role in the inactivation of ANP, bradykinin, and endothelins by its localization facing the circulating vasoactive peptides.", 
    "454": "The left ventricle progressively dilates in some patients after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Both systolic and diastolic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction can be of significance in the development of heart failure. Captopril has been shown to prevent dilatation, but the effect on LV diastolic function is unknown. In a placebo-controlled double-blind parallel study, 58 AMI patients with heart failure or low ejection fraction, or both, were consecutively randomized at day 7 to either placebo or captopril (25 mg twice daily). No differences were present between the groups at baseline. Fifty-three patients completed the 6-month study period. Both LV diastolic and systolic volume indexes increased significantly in the placebo group (17 and 14%, respectively); in the captopril group there was no change in LV diastolic volume index, but a 13% reduction in LV systolic volume index. Ejection fraction increased significantly in the captopril group. The peak flow velocities of the early and atrial filling phases were measured, and the ratio between the velocities was calculated. A significant reduction was observed during the study period in early peak flow velocity (65 to 52 cm/s) and in the ratio between early and atrial peak flow velocity (1.3 to 0.8) in the placebo group (p less than 0.05), but no significant changes occurred in the captopril group. No correlation was found between dilatation of the left ventricle and reduction in early peak flow velocity or the ratio between early and atrial peak flow velocity. In conclusion, captopril prevented LV dilatation, improved ejection fraction and prevented LV diastolic dysfunction in AMI patients with early signs of LV systolic dysfunction.", 
    "455": "Neutral endopeptidase 24.11, also known as the common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen, is a zinc metallopeptidase involved in the inactivation of biologically active peptides, such as the enkephalins and atrial natriuretic peptide. The highly potent radiolabeled inhibitor 2-((3-[125I]iodo-4-hydroxy)phenylmethyl)-4-N-[3-(hydroxyamino-3-oxo-1- phenylmethyl)propyl]amino-4-oxobutanoic acid ([125I]RB104; Ki = 30 pM) has been developed for the enzyme. [125I]RB104 is highly specific, its Ki for another widely distributed zinc peptidase, angiotensin-converting enzyme, being 15 microM. In binding studies using rat brain slices, [125I]RB104 was shown to have a high affinity (Kd = 300 +/- 20 pM) and high specific binding at the Kd concentration (90%). With rat brain homogenates the Kd of [125I]RB104 was 26.8 +/- 0.9 pM, close to the kinetically derived Kd, 7.0 +/- 0.8 pM. Using the inhibitor, we have developed a simple, rapid, and quantitative technique to detect low nanogram quantities of the endopeptidase directly from tissue extracts after SDS/PAGE. The method has been used to show the presence of low quantities of the enzyme in rabbit bone marrow. Apart from its sensitivity, \"inhibitor gel electrophoresis\" using [125I]RB104 has the advantage over immunohistochemical methods of being able to label the enzyme in all tissues and species. It will therefore be of great value in determining the exact role of this important regulatory peptidase in a number of biological systems. Moreover, this one-step characterization of neutral endopeptidase 24.11 could be extended to other zinc metallopeptidases such as angiotensin-converting enzyme or collagenases, and inhibitors with affinities as high as RB104 could open the way to visualization of zinc metallopeptidases in different tissues by electron microscopy.",

Trials of pharmacologic therapy aimed at preventing structural remodeling and repairing altered myocardial structure to or toward normal in the setting of hypertension, heart failure and diabetes are reviewed. It is proposed that these are therapeutic goals that may reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Although this hypothesis remains unproved the primary goal of therapy should be to preserve or restore tissue structure and function.",

    "463": "The endothelial angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE; EC 3.4.15.1) has recently been shown to contain two large homologous domains (called here the N and C domains), each being a zinc-dependent dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase. To further characterize the two active sites of ACE, we have investigated their interaction with four competitive ACE inhibitors, which are all potent antihypertensive drugs. The binding of [3H] trandolaprilat to the two active sites was examined using the wild-type ACE and four ACE mutants each containing only one intact domain, the other domain being either deleted or inactivated by point mutation of the zinc-coordinating histidines. In contrast with all the previous studies, which suggested the presence of a single high affinity inhibitor binding site in ACE, the present study shows that both the N and C domains of ACE contain a high affinity inhibitor binding site (KD = 3 and 1 X 10(-10) M, respectively, at pH 7.5, 4 degrees C, and 100 mM NaCl). Chloride stabilizes the enzyme-inhibitor complex for each domain primarily by slowing its dissociation rate, as the k-1 values of the N and C domains are markedly decreased (about 30- and 1100-fold, respectively) by 300 mM NaCl. At high chloride concentrations, the chloride effect is much greater for the C domain than for the N domain resulting in a higher affinity of this inhibitor for the C domain. In addition, the inhibitory potency of captopril (C), enalaprilat (E), and lisinopril (L) for each domain was assayed by hydrolysis of Hip-His-Leu. Their Ki values for the two domains are all within the nanomolar range, indicating that they are all highly potent inhibitors for both domains. However, their relative potencies are different for the C domain (L greater than E greater than C) and the N domain (C greater than E greater than L). The different inhibitor binding properties of the two domains observed in the present study provide strong evidence for the presence of structural differences between the two active sites of ACE.",

Some patients received oral hypolipidaemic treatment and some did not. Blood pressure and plasma lipids levels were measured before and after 1, 2 and 3 months of treatment. From the first month onward blood pressure decreased more in the treated group than in the placebo group (P < 0.05). Neither the combination nor the placebo altered the following parameters of lipid metabolism: total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein A1 and apolipoprotein B. The combination was well tolerated; 2 patients in each group had one or several adverse events. The results of this study show that treatment with the captopril-HCTZ combination in hypertensive, hyperlipidaemic patients has no influence on the normolipidaemic effects of diet and lipid-lowering treatment.", 
    "465": "Repeated sodium depletions produce a persistent, enhanced need-free salt intake in the rat, particularly in the female. The neurochemical mechanisms underlying the phenomenon are still unknown. The present studies evaluated the effect on the enhanced need-free salt intake of the female rat (1) of pharmacological interference with the natriorexigenic hormones angiotensin II and aldosterone and (2) of the central injection of the tachykinin peptides, which are endowed with antinatriorexic activity. The need-free salt intake of the female rat is not modified by treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril or by the aldosterone receptor antagonist RU-28318. On the other hand, the behavior is highly sensitive to the inhibitory effect of central tachykinins, suggesting the possibility that need-free salt intake might be linked to modification (down-regulation) of the inhibitory tachykininergic system.", 
    "466": "The effect of diuretic dose on the haemodynamic response to captopril was assessed in nine patients with chronic cardiac failure. Each patient was given an intravenous dose of captopril while maintained on (a) a low dose diuretic regime, and (b) a high dose diuretic regime. Activity of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system, as assessed by plasma concentrations of these hormones, was greater when patients were receiving the higher dose diuretic regime. The magnitude of haemodynamic response produced by intravenous captopril was greater when the patients were maintained on the high dose diuretic regime, although no significant correlation was found between resting plasma renin activity and resting plasma angiotensin II concentration and the change produced by captopril in any haemodynamic response on either diuretic regime. An increased dosage of loop diuretic potentiates the haemodynamic effects of captopril in patients with cardiac failure. Reduction of diuretic dose prior to introduction of captopril may protect against severe first dose hypotension.",

We report a single blind, cross-over trial of prolonged treatment with captopril and placebo in 18 Chagas disease patients with class IV NYHA heart failure. Ventricular dimensions, neurohormones, electrolytes and ventricular arrhythmias were analysed in 11 men and seven women receiving stable doses of digoxin and frusemide who were randomly divided into two intervention groups. Group I patients were given increasing doses of captopril up to 150 mg.day-1 maintained for 6 weeks, group II received the placebo. A 24 h Holter, 2-D echocardiogram, urinary catecholamines, plasma renin and electrolyte determinations were performed at the end of each phase. After a 2-week washout period, the two groups crossed over and another period of 6 weeks was observed. Ventricular arrhythmias were analysed by either Mann-Whitney or the Wilcoxon test. Remaining data were assessed by the Student t-test. A significant reduction in heart rate and urinary catecholamine levels, and enhanced plasma levels of renin, together with a reduction in ventricular couplets was found in the captopril-treated group. We conclude that captopril has a beneficial effect on neurohormones with a subsequently reduced heart rate and diminished incidence of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with Chagas disease. This effect might result in a reduction of mortality caused by the disease, suggesting the need for further investigations.", 
    "468": "African Americans have a higher prevalence of hypertension than white Americans. Morbid consequences of hypertensive disease are greater in blacks than whites. For members of high-risk groups such as blacks, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring may be useful in supplementing casual clinic measurements to prevent misdiagnosis, better characterize the temporal topography of blood pressure responses, and improve prediction of left ventricular hypertrophy, hypertensive complications, morbidity, and mortality. In conjunction with other data, laboratory experiments showing that African Americans as a group show greater peripheral resistance and slowed natriuretic responses to behavioral stressors than whites, appear to provide insights as to why blacks generally respond better to diuretics and calcium channel blockers than to beta-adrenergic antagonists or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. It is suggested that ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and behavioral tasks in the laboratory may help predict individual responsiveness to antihypertensive agents.",

It is concluded that enalapril appears to be useful in the treatment of heart failure in hypertensive patients with normal systolic function and diastolic dysfunction.", 
    "470": "In 45 patients with essential hypertension and 15 age-matched normotensive control subjects, the renal resistive index, as an expression of arterial impedance, was determined using Doppler ultrasound. In both kidneys the resistive index was assessed at baseline and after captopril test (50 mg orally). In the moderate and severe hypertensives, compared to mild hypertensives and control subjects, the baseline resistive index was significantly higher (P less than .05). Following captopril, the resistive index increased only in normotensives (P less than .05) and in mild hypertensives (P less than .05). Univariate and multivariate analyses show that the duration and severity of hypertension correlated with an increase of the resistive index both in basal and in dynamic conditions. Thus, the use of the resistive index, as determined by echo-Doppler, could provide useful information for the assessment of renal vascular impedance in essential hypertensive patients. This would help us detect the evolution of hypertensive disease to the higher degrees of severity that are correlated to renal arteriolar damage.", 
    "471": "In order to study the influence of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition on the progression of chronic nephropathy, 70 patients with a median glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 15 (range, 6 to 54) mL/min/1.73 m2 were randomized in an open study to basic treatment with enalapril or conventional antihypertensive treatment. The patients were followed for at least 2 years or until they needed dialysis. The groups were comparable with respect to age and sex distribution, etiology of renal diseases, initial levels of renal function and arterial blood pressure (BP), and protein intake. The therapeutic goal was a BP of 120 to 140/80 to 90 mm Hg. The GFR, estimated by the plasma clearance of 51Cr-EDTA, was measured every third month, and the individual rate of progression was calculated as the slope of the GFR v time plot. In the enalapril group, the median decline in GFR was -0.20 (range, +0.18 to -7.11) mL/min/1.73 m2/month and in the control group it was -0.31 (+0.01 to -1.97) mL/min/1.73 m2/month (P less than .05). There was no significant difference in blood pressure or plasma lipid levels between the groups. Thus, the progression of moderate to severe chronic nephropathy was slower on a basic treatment with enalapril as compared to conventional antihypertensive therapy.", 
    "472": "The hemodynamic, hormonal, and renal effects of angiotensin II-type 1 receptor antagonism (AT1A) have not been documented previously in heart failure (HF) or compared with angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibition (ACEI). Accordingly, we investigated the acute (2-h) response to losartan (1 and 10 mg/kg iv) or vehicle (N saline) followed by captopril (12.5 mg) on separate days in an ovine model of HF induced by 7 days of rapid ventricular pacing. Losartan induced a significant rise in plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma angiotensin II levels (P less than 0.01 and P less than 0.001, respectively), in association with a fall in the plasma aldosterone-to-PRA ratio (P less than 0.001) and plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (P less than 0.05). Mean arterial and left atrial pressure both fell significantly after losartan (P less than 0.001), whereas the rise in cardiac output was not sustained. The response to captopril was similar except for plasma angiotensin II, which declined (P less than 0.001). Glomerular filtration and urine sodium excretion were maintained despite a fall in renal perfusion pressure. In conclusion, the vasodilatation and renal effects of AT1A were similar to ACEI. Thus AT1A may be a useful therapeutic alternative to ACEI in HF.", 
    "473": "Previous studies in experimental models of progressive renal failure have shown that the capacity of antihypertensive drugs to protect glomeruli from sclerosis is often unpredictable from their effect on systemic blood pressure. The present study was undertaken to ascertain whether this systemic blood pressure-independent structure-preserving effect of antihypertensives, particularly angiotensin II converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), is confined to the glomerulus or not, as well as whether this effect is mediated via angiotensin II (Ang II). The following experimental drug regimens were used in the rat model of subtotal nephrectomy (sNPX): so-called triple therapy [TRX; a combination of reserpine 5 mg/liter drinking water (DW), hydralazine 80 mg/liter DW and hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg/liter DW], or ACEI (either captopril, CPL, 600 mg/liter DW, enalapril, ENL, 400 mg/liter DW or lisinopril, LSL, 200 mg/liter DW), or a novel Ang II receptor antagonist (Ang IIR, L-158,809, 20 mg/liter DW). These dosages were identified in pilot studies to be the minimum required to control systemic blood pressure in the early phase up to 12 weeks. In addition, a separate group was treated with a higher dose of L-158,809 (80 mg/liter DW) with equipotent systemic pressor effect. Treatment was initiated eight weeks after subtotal nephrectomy following renal biopsy, and animals were sacrificed at 16 weeks. In ACEI treated rats, carotid arterial wall thickening (WT), defined as ratio of media thickening to radius of outer vessel wall, was similar to normal age-matched control (0.073 in all ACEI treated rats, vs. 0.074 in normal control) and significantly less than with TRX (ratio 0.118) or untreated sNPX (0.130). Even more remarkably, coronary arteriole WT in ACEI-treated rats averaged 0.139, a value less than one half and one third of TRX (0.298) and untreated sNPX control (0.388), respectively. Similar results were obtained for mesenteric artery WT. These findings were closely paralleled by changes of glomerular sclerosis. In untreated sNPX control rats, glomerular sclerosis increased from biopsy to autopsy specimens by an average of 458%. Although TRX dampened the degree of increase in sclerosis to on average 212%, this protective effect was far less than that achieved by ACEI. In the latter, sclerosis increased on average only 65% from biopsy to autopsy. Although all ACEIs were more effective than TRX, captopril and lisinopril groups showed greatest benefit at these doses. Ang IIR also protected renal and extrarenal structures with 34% increase of sclerosis index in low dose and WT 0.088, 0.117 and 0.112, respectively in carotid, mesenteric and coronary arteries.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "474": "1. We studied the renal effects of reinfusing low dose angiotensin II (1 ng kg-1 min-1) into seven salt-replete healthy volunteers after pretreatment with the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril (25 mg) to establish whether the natriuretic and renal haemodynamic responses to ACE inhibition in normal man result from suppression of circulating angiotensin II. In the same subjects we also studied the effect of captopril (25 mg) with and without exogenous angiotensin II (1 ng kg-1 min-1) on the natriuretic response to intravenous frusemide (20 mg). 2. In the pre-frusemide study captopril increased absolute and fractional excretion of sodium and paraaminohippurate clearance but had no effect on inulin clearance. 3. Reinfusion of angiotensin II after captopril pretreatment completely suppressed the renal effects of ACE inhibition, yielding renal vasoconstrictor and antinatriuretic effects equivalent to those produced by infused angiotensin II in the absence of captopril. 4. Frusemide increased renal sodium excretion without affecting paraaminohippurate or inulin clearance. Captopril augmented frusemide-induced natriuresis and again this effect was reversed by angiotensin II reinfusion. 5. We conclude that captopril augments both basal and frusemide-induced renal sodium excretion in normal man. Our findings suggest that these renal responses to ACE inhibition may be mediated by inhibition of circulating angiotensin II, specifically its renal tubular salt-retaining actions, rather than via effects on other neurohumoral systems.",

In conscious rats, the relative potencies (ED50) were 29 micrograms/kg i.v. and 23 micrograms/kg p.o. Duration of action with single i.v. or p.o. doses exceeded 6 hr in rats. In similar experiments using rhesus monkeys, the potencies of L-158,809 were 10 micrograms/kg i.v. and approximately 100 micrograms/kg p.o. In these rats and monkeys, L-158,809 was 10 to 100 times more potent than DuP-753 (losartan) and approximately 3 times more potent than the metabolite, EXP3174. AII-induced elevation of plasma aldosterone in rats was also inhibited by L-158,809. Unlike angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, L-158,809 did not potentiate the hypotensive responses to i.v. bradykinin. L-158,809 was antihypertensive in high renin hypertensive rats (aortic coarction) and volume-depleted rhesus monkeys. The maximum hypotensive responses with acute doses of L-158,809 were equal to those with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor in these renin-dependent animal models. From these in vivo data, L-158,809 is a selective AII receptor antagonist with high potency, good p.o. absorption, long duration and antihypertensive efficacy equal to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition after single doses.",

    "485": "Infrarenal aortic cross-clamping is associated with impairment of renal hemodynamics due to vasoconstriction, the mechanism of which remains under debate. To assess the renal effect of two potent renal vasodilators (enalapril, a converting enzyme inhibitor, and nicardipine, a calcium antagonist), 24 patients scheduled for reconstructive aortic surgery were randomly allocated to one of three treatment groups (n = 8 each) and received either a placebo, nicardipine, or enalapril. Anesthesia consisted of flunitrazepam, fentanyl, pancuronium, and, occasionally, droperidol. Although aortic cross-clamping was associated with no change in mean arterial blood pressure, decreased cardiac output and increased systemic vascular resistance occurred in control patients (33% and 43%, respectively, both P less than 0.05 versus baseline) and nicardipine-treated patients (51.7% and 67.7%, respectively, both P less than 0.05 versus baseline); however, changes in cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance failed to reach significance in enalapril-treated patients. Glomerular filtration rate (technetium 99-diethylenetriaminepentacetic acid clearance) and effective renal plasma flow (iodo-Hippuran 131 clearance) decreased for the duration of aortic cross-clamping in control patients (42.9% and 18.5%, respectively, both P less than 0.05 versus baseline) and enalapril-treated patients (34.0% and 38.1%, respectively, both P less than 0.05 versus baseline), but no change was observed in nicardipine-treated patients. These results suggest that the reninangiotensin system is not an important determinant of the renal vasoconstriction associated with aortic cross-clamping. In contrast, renal dysfunction may be alleviated by the dihydropyridine derivative nicardipine, which probably acts at the level of the preglomerular resistance vessels.", 
    "486": "The objective of the present study was to determine whether pretreatment neurohormonal and renal hemodynamic parameters predict the change in renal function with the administration of quinapril, a new angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Twenty patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III and IV heart failure were evaluated. Following pretreatment determination of renal function and plasma neurohormones, patients were treated daily with 10 mg of quinapril. Measurements of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal plasma flow (RPF) were repeated after 7 weeks to assess changes in function (delta GFR and delta RPF). Mean GFR increased from 49 +/- 6 to 56 +/- 7 ml/min/1.73 m2 (p = 0.10), but decreased in five patients. Mean RPF increased from 235 +/- 23 to 252 +/- 23 ml/min/1.73 m2 (p = 0.08), but decreased in five patients. There was no relation between delta GFR and baseline determinations of GFR, RPF, plasma renin activity, plasma angiotensin II, or serum Na. Only a high filtration fraction (GFR/RPF) predicted a decreased GFR (r = 0.61, p less than 0.005). In contrast, no baseline renal hemodynamic parameter correlated with delta RPF. We conclude that poor renal function does not increase the risk of renal deterioration with quinapril. However, dependence of renal function upon the renin-angiotensin system may be predicted by a high filtration fraction.",

Three systems were used to generate visible fluorescence in albumin and IgG; glycation, exposure to copper/hydrogen peroxide and gamma radiation. All three thiol-containing compounds inhibited fluorescence development in IgG and albumin, when fluorescence was generated by glycation or gamma radiation. Other ACE inhibitors had no effect with IgG. Enalapril and perindoprilat showed less effect than captopril with albumin; enalaprilat had no effect. No compound had any effect on fluorescence generation by copper/hydrogen peroxide. Captopril may have an additional antioxidant effect compared to other ACE inhibitors.",

Patients were monitored after one month and at the end of hypotensive therapy. The study showed a statistically significant reduction of blood pressure in both groups. In the elderly group blood pressure diminished from a mean basal level of 198.8/104.5 mmHg to 140.4/80.5 mmHg, whereas in the adult group pressure values were reduced from 190.1/108.4 mmHg to 134.0/80.6 mmHg. These results match those of an earlier study and, in conclusion, the Authors affirm that this combinations is a suitable \"geriatric drug\" since it responds to the needs of elderly hypertensive patients.

The contractile effect was immediate, and had an amplitude which at the highest concentration used, 10(-5) M, reached 103 +/- 16% of the mean contraction produced by K+ 124 mM (27.6 +/- 1.4 mN). The AtII effect was completely blocked by saralasin 10(-6) M, but was not affected by pre-treatment of the preparations with captopril or enalaprilate. There was a marked tachyphylaxis to the actions of the peptide. AtI (10(-8)-10(-5) M) also caused contractions which were rapidly developing, and subject to a marked tachyphylaxis. At a concentration of 10(-5) M, the mean amplitude was 66 +/- 9% of the K(+)-induced contraction. The contractions were blocked by saralasin 10(-6) M, but not by captopril or enalaprilate 10(-5) M. In contrast, contractions produced by AtI in rabbit mesenteric arteries were practically abolished by the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. The contractions induced by both AtI and AtII were practically abolished after pre-treatment in a nominally calcium-free Krebs solution. However, blockade of L-type calcium channels by nifedipine 10(-6) M reduced the responses to both AtI 10(-6) M (by 38 +/- 4%) and AtII 10(-6) M (by 39 +/- 7%), but never abolished the contractions.

In vitro, short-circuit current (SCC) and potential difference (PD) were measured with the conventional Ussing technique. In vivo, electric parameters and net fluid transport (NFT) were simultaneously recorded with two different techniques. In separate in vivo experiments alkaline secretion (As) was estimated. In vitro, the chloride channel blocking substance 5-nitro-2(-3-phenylpropyl-amino)benzoic acid (NPPB) and the loop diuretic substance furosemide (F) inhibited SCC, whereas the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor acetazolamide (Ace) lacked effect. Noradrenaline inhibited SCC and this effect was antagonized by NPPB and F. In vivo, cholera toxin induced a parallel increase in PD/SCC and fluid secretion. Conversely, mesenteric nerve stimulation (MNS) or administration of the nicotinic antagonist hexamethonium (Hx), concomitantly inhibited PD/SCC and fluid secretion. However, there was a poor correlation between the magnitudes of these effects. F inhibited SCC in vivo and also the SCC-effect of MNS. However, F had no effect on fluid secretion in vivo, nor on the NFT-effect of MNS. Jejunal As was stimulated by cholera toxin and MNS significantly inhibited As.

Four groups of six dogs each were studied. The first group was exposed to saline expansion (8% body weight) (SE).

The third and fourth groups were similar but in dogs treated with high doses of captopril (SE + C and AVD + C). Dogs were anesthetized with phenobarbital. Control measurements were made for 30 minutes before and 60 minutes during saline expansion. Glomerular filtration rate (inulin), renal blood flow (para-aminohippuric acid) and mean arterial pressure were similar in the four groups during the experiment.

In contrast, in the AVD group it only rose from 0.8 +/- 0.2 to 3.5 +/- 0.7% and in the AVD + C group from 1.3 +/- 0.4 to 4.1 +/- 0.6%. Therefore, the increment in sodium excretion during saline expansion was significantly lower in dogs exposed to acute volume depletion, independent of the treatment with captopril. The blunted natriuresis cannot be explained by differences in GFR, RBF or MAP. These results suggest that renin angiotensin system is not the responsible agent of the sodium retention that follows acute volume depletion.",

ANTIHYPERTENSIVE THERAPY: A reduction in arterial pressure can alter the course of human chronic renal disease. However, it is not clear whether any one class of antihypertensive drug is superior to any other class in these patients. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may prevent the progression from incipient to overt diabetic nephropathy and afford better protection than conventional treatment. In patients with non-diabetic renal disease there is no unequivocal evidence for a protective effect. In renal transplant recipients, mainly those taking cyclosporine, ACE inhibitors are equally effective compared to calcium antagonists in the control of hypertension, but their renal effects in transplant recipients without renal artery stenosis have not yet been assessed.", 
    "510": "In hypertension, structural changes in the cardiovascular system affect not only small arteries and the heart but also the large arteries, particularly in elderly people. It has been suggested that structural alterations to the small arteries are responsible for the elevation in mean arterial pressure seen in hypertension, as a result of increased vascular resistance. However, the amplitude of pressure oscillation (pulse pressure) is influenced by other haemodynamic mechanisms that involve large arteries including a decrease in compliance and an increase in wave reflection.", 
    "511": "Structural alterations to the large arteries may, in hypertensive subjects, be responsible for an increase in the amplitude of pressure oscillation, leading to a disproportionate increase in systolic over diastolic blood pressure because of arterial (not arteriolar) changes.

    "517": "The regional vasodilator effects, both arteriolar and arterial, of the major classes of drugs used in the treatment of coronary insufficiency, arterial hypertension and cardiac failure appear to be heterogenous. This heterogeneity is seen with a given drug in different vascular beds; within a class of drugs in a single vascular region; and between the regional vasodilator profiles of different classes of drugs. From the clinical point of view, the consequences of this heterogeneous vasodilation may be either positive (increase in flow, favourable redistribution of flow) or negative (steal phenomenon, opening of shunts).", 
    "518": "In treating hypertension the optimal dose of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor is derived from dose-response curves that relate the quantity of drug taken to the resulting fall in blood pressure; the blood pressure fall reflects a decrease in vascular resistance and hence, a degree of arteriolar vasodilation. However, ACE inhibition dilates not only the small arteries but also the larger calibre arteries, which increases compliance. Given the differences in structure and function of large and small arteries, the optimal drug dose for a given vessel may differ according to the size and structure of the vessel. DOSE-RESPONSE EFFECTS IN CLINICAL STUDIES: Clinical studies indicate that in the brachial artery territory, larger doses are required to obtain arterial dilation than to produce a decrease in vascular resistance. In the aorta, an improvement in arterial compliance and distensibility is governed both by the fall in blood pressure and the drug dose. Finally, for the femoral artery, the degree of arterial dilation is influenced markedly only by the drug dose.", 
    "519": "An understanding of the drug dose required to produce a given change in the hypertensive arterial system may have important implications for the control of blood pressure. For a given mean arterial pressure, systolic blood pressure is lower and diastolic blood pressure higher when aortic compliance is increased, a haemodynamic change commonly seen following ACE inhibition. Recent double-blind studies have shown that ACE inhibitors produced a more pronounced decrease in systolic than diastolic blood pressure.",

Doses were doubled at 4 weeks if the diastolic blood pressure remained above 95 mmHg. At the end of 8 weeks of treatment, there were 9 patients taking hydrochlorothiazide, 10 patients taking timolol and 7 patients taking enalapril. Hydrochlorothiazide significantly lowered both systolic and diastolic blood pressure at 4 and 8 weeks compared with pre-treatment levels. Timolol and enalapril did not significantly lower the systolic blood pressure, but each lowered the diastolic blood pressure at 4 weeks and 8 weeks respectively. More patients on hydrochlorothiazide attained a diastolic blood pressure of less than 90 mmHg while less patients required doubling of dosage compared to timolol and enalapril.

Captopril also significantly reduced the maximal TGF response in both intact and remnant kidneys at 2 (NX from 13 +/- 3 to 7 +/- 1 mm Hg; CNT from 10 +/- 1 to 5 +/- 1 mm Hg) and 8 wk (NX from 15 +/- 1 to 9 +/- 2 mm Hg; CNT from 13 +/- 1 to 7 +/- 1 mm Hg).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "523": "The authors examined the effects of a long-term treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, alacepril, with respect to the reversal of left ventricular hypertrophy and the improvement of left ventricular function. Ten uncomplicated essential hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy, aged 53 +/- 8 years, were treated with alacepril alone for 12 months. All patients underwent echocardiography to to assess left ventricular dimensions and function before and after the treatment. After the treatment, blood pressure was decreased significantly from 163 +/- 14.1/98 +/- 4.2 to 142 +/- 20.3/86 +/- 11.0 mm Hg (each, P less than .01), whereas heart rate did not change (66 +/- 6 versus 69 +/- 8 beats/min). The left ventricular mass index was decreased significantly from 146 +/- 27 to 119 +/- 29 g/m2 (P less than .01). Ejection fraction, fractional shortening, peak shortening rate, and peak lengthening rate all improved significantly after the treatment. There was a significant inverse relationship between fractional shortening and end-systolic wall stress before the treatment (r = .63, P less than .05), and this relationship did not change after the treatment. It is concluded that alacepril improved both left ventricular systolic and diastolic function without causing any consistent augmentation of left ventricular contractility.", 
    "524": "The effects of coadministration of a renin inhibitor, CP-80,794, and an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, on blood pressure of sodium-depleted guinea pigs was studied. Dose-response curves for CP-80,794 (0.3-3.0 mg/kg i.v.) and captopril (0.03-1.0 mg/kg i.v.) were obtained either alone or in the presence of a submaximal dose of the other inhibitor. The hypotensive response calculated for each compound individually was subtracted from the combined dose response. The results showed that statistically significant synergy with captopril and CP-80,794 occurred when the area rather than the peak drop or duration of change in blood pressure was measured. The degree of the synergy indicated that to achieve the same reduction in blood pressure, the dose of each drug, below the high end of its response range, could be decreased approximately sixfold when administered in combination. It was determined that the plasma pharmacokinetics of CP-80,794 were not altered during coadministration, as plasma concentrations of CP-80,794 were similar in the presence and absence of 0.1 mg/kg i.v. of captopril. These results indicate that by inhibiting sequential enzymes in the renin-angiotensin system, synergistic effects can be produced. The relative safety of each inhibitor could be improved by large reductions in dose when used concurrently.", 
    "525": "Long-term treatment with angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) prolongs survival in rats developing congestive heart failure after myocardial infarction (MI). In this experimental model, we investigated at regular intervals the effects of a 1-year oral treatment with trandolapril, a new ACEI, on (a) survival rate and duration and (b) hemodynamic, biological, and cardiac and vascular histomorphological parameters. Control MI rats and sham-operated trandolapril-treated and control rats were simultaneously studied. In MI rats, trandolapril significantly increased the survival rate and duration, increasing the life expectancy by approximately 6 months. It also significantly decreased the arterial blood pressure and increased diuresis. These effects occurred as soon as the treatment was started and persisted throughout the study. Trandolapril significantly limited the development of myocardial hypertrophy, decreasing the heart weight and left ventricular hypertrophic area and increasing the left ventricular myocyte nuclear density, but these effects, starting after 3-6 months, were delayed compared to the hemodynamic ones. Finally, trandolapril limited the development of myocardial (both subendocardial and subepicardial) and aortic fibrosis. It is concluded that the early pre- and afterload effects of trandolapril are initially responsible for its beneficial action on survival, whereas later the drug's antihypertrophic and antifibrotic properties together with persistent hemodynamic effects account for the prolonged survival improvement.", 
    "526": "Idrapril is the prototype of a new chemical class of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, the hydroxamic non-amino acid derivatives. Idrapril strongly inhibited rat and human plasma ACE and rabbit lung ACE (IC50: 7-12 nM) as well as the pressor response induced by angiotensin I in anesthetized rats (ED50: 63 nmol/kg i.v.). Idrapril (0.04-23 mumol/kg i.v.) lowered the blood pressure dose dependently, up to 20-35%, in different models of hypertension (sodium-depleted spontaneously hypertensive rat, two-kidney-one-clip renal hypertensive rat, and aortic-coarctated rat), its profile being similar to that of captopril in terms of potency and efficacy. Idrapril and captopril reduced the blood pressure and potentiated substance P-induced bronchoconstriction in the guinea pig to the same extent, suggesting a similar degree of ACE inhibition in the circulation. However, idrapril potentiated capsaicin-induced bronchoconstriction (a model that has been related to the liability of ACE inhibitors to produce cough in patients) less effectively than captopril. We conclude that effective ACE inhibition in vitro and in vivo can be obtained with this novel class of compounds.", 
    "527": "Blunted cardiac responses to sympathetic and vagal activation are key features of heart failure. Since the modulation of drug effects by a selective autonomic dysfunction is little known, we developed an acute rabbit model imitating these defects. Anesthetized rabbits were subject to cervical vagotomy and propranolol (1 mg/kg i.v.) pretreatment, thus eliminating vagally and sympathetically mediated cardiac responses, while maintaining the responsiveness of the peripheral circulation to these reflexes (\"V-B\" animals). Responses to drugs were altered in V-B compared with normal animals: Ouabain (5-50 micrograms/kg) increased myocardial contractile force more and milrinone (30-300 micrograms/kg) less, yet it increased the heart rate more; the reflex tachycardia to nitroprusside (1-10 micrograms/kg/min) was blunted and spirapril (0.1 and 1 mg/kg, all i.v.) decreased the central venous pressure only in V-B animals. Several drug effects were thus strongly modulated by autonomic dysfunction and responses of V-B animals were closer to those of heart failure patients than the responses of the normal animals, especially for milrinone.", 
    "528": "Inhibitors of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE, EC 3.4.15.1) are important in the treatment of the high blood pressure. The therapeutically used drugs captopril, enalapril and ramipril are enzymatic stable short pseudo-peptides. They are stabilized against enzymatic degradation and therefore usefully for oral application. But for some indications e.g. post operative treatment and shock therapy well dosed infusions are needed. For this purpose we attached nona-, penta- and tripeptide inhibitors of the ACE to immunologically inert dextran polymers. The inhibitors are derived as well from the bradykinin potentiating nonapeptide BPP9 alpha (Pyr-Trp-Pro-Arg-Pro-Gln-Ile-Pro-Pro) and the bradykinin potentiating pentapeptide BPP5 alpha (Pyr-Lys-Trp-Ala-Pro), both originally isolated from snake venoms, as from acylated tripeptides with the structure Acyl-AA1-Arg-Pro. We estimated the influence on the biological activity of two different linkers to the dextran polymers. The coupling to the polymer was achieved on the one hand via the aldehyd moiety (DAD-AK) and on the other hand by the carboxyl residue (KMD). In the case of DAD-AK-polymers the condensation of the peptides was performed by the N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of the polymer. Because of the instability of the KMD-OSU in this case water soluble carbodiimides are used. The polymer bound peptides inhibit the isolated ACE, but in the most cases with a reduced activity. Only the tripeptide DPhe-Arg-Pro has a enhanced activity in the polymer bound state. The polymer bound inhibitors show a prolongated action on normotensive rats by intravenous application.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "529": "Owing to the wide variety of symptoms, the long clinical course, the inadequate knowledge of the points at which therapeutic action is appropriate and the difficulty of obtaining objective measurements of the treatment results, therapy for systemic sclerosis has to be planned individually. Besides basic recommendations (avoidance of noxious substances, sensible diet, keeping warm, active exercises), physiotherapy and psychological guidance, the therapy is directed at three pathogenetic complexes. Among the vasoactive substances the prostacyclins, calcium channel blockers and angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (in the case of complicated renal involvement) are recommended. They inhibit the thrombocyte hyperaggregation and lead to vasodilatation. The anti-inflammatory substances prednisolone and azathioprine also exert immunosuppressant (and cytotoxic) effect. Their use is indicated in inflammatory, immunologically active forms of systemic sclerosis. Antifibrotic agents inhibit cross-link formation, prolylhydroxylase, extrusion of collagen from fibroblasts and, thus, collagen synthesis. In addition, they favour the degradation of collagen via the activation of collagenase. Good results have been reported with penicillamine and penicillin G. Pentoxyphyllin leads to vasodilatation and also inhibits collagen metabolism. Promising agents and procedures for future use include cyclosporin A, CD4 antibodies, photopheresis, interferon gamma and factor XIII. A critical attitude to therapy and a great deal of patience are necessary to avoid harming the patients, especially as it is often some months before any effects of the treatment are seen.", 
    "530": "To investigate the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in the modulation of bronchial reactivity, we tested the effects of a specific ACE inhibitor, captopril (CAP), on the bronchial reactivity to substance P (SP) and methacholine (MCH) in unanesthetized guinea pigs. The relative role of ACE on the vascular endothelium and ACE in the airway tissue was examined by administering CAP as an intravenous infusion and by an inhaled aerosol. Bronchial reactivity was evaluated by a provocative dose of SP or MCH at a concentration that would double the baseline value of the specific airway resistance (PC200 or PD200). Neither pretreatment with infused CAP (10 mg/kg) nor inhaled CAP (5 mg) enhanced bronchial reactivity to inhaled SP, whereas the reactivity to infused SP (7.5 x 10(-3) to 20 nM/kg) was enhanced significantly by pretreatment with infused CAP (10 mg/kg) (p less than 0.05). The infusion of CAP (10 mg/kg) also enhanced the bronchial reactivity to both infused MCH (0.05 to 25 micrograms/kg) and inhaled MCH (0.05 to 25 mg/ml) (both p less than 0.05). However, the inhalation of CAP (5 mg) did not affect the bronchial reactivity to inhaled MCH. These observations suggest that ACE located on the vascular endothelium may modulate bronchial reactivity.",

D-Lactate dehydrogenase (D-LDH) from Staphylococcus epidermidis was chosen as the most appropriate enzyme to carry out the NADH-dependent reduction. Formate dehydrogenase (FDH) was used for NADH regeneration. Detailed kinetic measurements and a mathematical model for the coupled enzyme reactions were applied to calculate the optimal conditions for continuous production of the alpha-hydroxy acid. A mass of 1 kg [corrected] (R)-2-hydroxy-4-phenylbutyric acid was synthesized in a 220 ml enzyme membrane reactor over a period of 4 weeks. A mean space-time-yield of 165 g l-1 d-1 was achieved at low enzyme consumptions of 150 U kg-1 alpha-hydroxy acid for FDH and D-LDH.", 
    "532": "Three experiments that used a latent inhibition procedure to investigate the effects of ceronapril on attentional processes in the rat are reported. Latent inhibition is a behavioural paradigm in which prior exposure to a stimulus with no significant consequences retards subsequent conditioning to that stimulus when it is paired with reinforcement. Latent inhibition reflects a process of learning to ignore, or tune out, irrelevant stimuli, and has been suggested as an animal model of the attentional processes disrupted in the acute phase of schizophrenia. In animals, latent inhibition is disrupted by the administration of low doses of amphetamine and enhanced by the administration of neuroleptics. Ceronapril is an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor that has been shown to retard the breakdown of central cholecystokinin. It has been proposed that elevation of cholecystokinin levels in the brain may possess neuroleptic-like properties. We assessed this possibility by determining the effects of ceronapril on latent inhibition using a conditioned emotional response procedure, consisting of three stages: pre-exposure, in which the to-be-conditioned stimulus, a tone, was repeatedly presented without reinforcement; conditioning, in which the pre-exposed stimulus was paired with shock; and test, where latent inhibition was indexed by animals' suppression of licking during tone presentation. In Experiment 1, 20 tone pre-exposures were given, and conditioning consisted of five tone-shock pairings; we assessed the effects of 0.005 mg/kg, 0.05 mg/kg and 0.5 mg/kg ceronapril, compared with vehicle injections. In Experiment 2, five tone pre-exposures were given, and conditioning consisted of two tone-shock pairings: we assessed the effects of 0.05 mg/kg ceronapril, compared with vehicle injections.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "533": "1. Chymotrypsin (Cht) administration (14 mg/kg, i.v.) to rats always caused hypertension; hypotension preceded this effect in 64% of the observations (n = 11). 2. A 68% reduction of circulating kininogen but not of angiotensinogen was observed after Cht administration. 3. Cht effects were not affected by captopril, [Sar1-Leu8]-angiotensin II and alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists. In 70% of the observations (n = 10) hypotension was abolished by a mixture of histamine H1- and H2-antagonists. Therefore histamine release may explain hypotension. 4. Cht released in vitro from rat plasma, a substance producing hypertension in the rat and contraction of the guinea-pig ileum. Both effects were antagonized by [Sar1-Leu8]-angiotensin II. 5. In spite of this angiotensin release in vitro, the hypertensive component of the in vivo response to Cht seems to be due to some other substance.", 
    "534": "Two endothelial cell lines were derived from grafts of the central nervous system using retrovirus mediated gene transfer to introduce the polyoma middle-T oncogene into fetal rat brain endothelial cells and transplantation of these cells into adult rat brain. In this report, we further characterize these cells and the effect of dexamethasone on the expression of specific enzymatic markers. These cells take up acetylated low density lipoprotein, leucine, and glucose, and express Factor VIII-related antigen, angiotensin converting enzyme, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase, and as yet undescribed aminopeptidase A and B-like enzymes. When grown on semi-permeable membranes, these transformed cells do not spontaneously retain small hydrophilic molecules. In culture, one of the lines (EC 193) forms a confluent monolayer of spindle-shaped cells homogenously expressing gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase at a level comparable to primary cells. The other cell line (EC 219) grows as clusters of elongated cells, and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase activity is expressed mainly in cells forming the clusters. This clustered pattern changes to a confluent one after culture on type-I collagen. Dexamethasone increases angiotensin-converting enzyme activity, and decreases the expression of gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase and aminopeptidase A, whereas the aminopeptidase B activity is little modified. Inhibition of aminopeptidase A activity by amastatin, potentiates angiotensin II effects on DNA synthesis. These results indicate that retrovirally transformed brain endothelial cells are a useful model for studying the blood-brain barrier in vitro and that dexamethasone, an agent with the potential to reduce brain edema, directly affects some blood-brain barrier properties in these endothelial cell lines.",

The major criterion for selection was that the studies be of CHF patients in randomized controlled clinical trials, particularly with a mortality/survival endpoint. Additional clinical trials of nonmortality endpoints in CHF patients and mortality trials in non-CHF patients were also selected to support possible pathophysiological insights for future CHF trials.",

Other systemic vasodilators may also be beneficial. The effects of digitalis on survival and morbidity in CHF are presently uncertain, but should be resolved in the near future. Other inotropic agents, at least in the long term, are clinically detrimental. Diuretics decrease morbidity, but their effect on mortality in CHF remains unknown. Beta-blocker and magnesium therapy offer promise in CHF, but await definitive clinical trials evaluation.", 
    "540": "The current medical therapy of CHF should definitely include ACE inhibitors, probably diuretics and possibly other vasodilators. Further viable trials of promising new, and older heretofore under-evaluated, CHF therapies are needed.

    "541": "This study examines the effects of two converting enzyme inhibitors (captopril and enalaprilat) and two alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonists (phentolamine and phenoxybenzamine) on the pressor response produced by exogenous angiotensin I ([Asp1, Val5, Ser9] ANG I, fowl) and [Val5] angiotensin II (ANG II) in the American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis). Bolus administration of ANG I at 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 micrograms/kg; ANG II at 0.05, 0.1, and 0.5 micrograms/kg; or norepinephrine (NE) at 2 micrograms/kg elicited dose-dependent increases in arterial blood pressure. Captopril (0.5 mg/kg/hr) and enalaprilat (300 micrograms/kg/hr) significantly reduced the response to ANG I, but not ANG II or NE. Both phenoxybenzamine (0.25 mg/kg/min) and phentolamine (1 mg/kg/hr) effectively blocked the NE pressor response (84 and 88%, respectively) and attenuated (42-80%) the pressor effects of ANG I and ANG II. These results support previous work suggesting the alligator may possess a renin-angiotensin system with characteristics similar to those found in mammals and other vertebrates. In addition, the pressor response to exogenously administered ANG I and ANG II was attenuated by alpha adrenergic receptor blockade and thus may be due, in part, to secondary catecholamine release.", 
    "542": "Because physicians have traditionally considered heart failure to be a hemodynamic disorder, they have described the syndrome of heart failure using hemodynamic concepts and have designed treatment strategies to correct the hemodynamic derangements of the disease. However, although hemodynamic abnormalities may explain the symptoms of heart failure, they are not sufficient to explain the progression of heart failure and, ultimately, the death of the patient. Therapeutic interventions may improve the hemodynamic status of patients but adversely affect their long-term outcome. These findings have raised questions about the validity of the hemodynamic hypothesis and suggest that alternative mechanisms must play a primary role in advancing the disease process. Several lines of evidence suggest that neurohormonal mechanisms play a central role in the progression of heart failure. Activation of the sympathetic nervous system and renin-angiotensin system exerts a direct deleterious effect on the heart that is independent of the hemodynamic actions of these endogenous mechanisms. Therapeutic interventions that block the effects of these neurohormonal systems favorably alter the natural history of heart failure, and such benefits cannot be explained by the effect of these treatments on cardiac contractility and ejection fraction. Conversely, pharmacologic agents that adversely influence neurohormonal systems in heart failure may increase cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, even though they exert favorable hemodynamic effects. These observations support the formulation of a neurohormonal hypothesis of heart failure and provide the basis for the development of novel therapeutic strategies in the next decade.", 
    "543": "Renal arterial disease occurs in 3-5% of patients with systemic hypertension. It is important to determine the type of lesion by arteriography to understand the natural history of the specific disease and to choose appropriate therapy. Some have questioned why arteriography should be performed if an operation or percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty is not considered. One must keep in mind that if the arteriographic characteristics are known, the specific lesion and its course may be predicted, resulting in better management of the disease. In patients with a unilateral lesion angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are efficacious, but calcium antagonists may also be used. However, if therapy does not provide optimum control of blood pressure or the impairment of renal function progresses, then percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty or surgery should be reconsidered.", 
    "544": "An acute captopril test with a repeated dynamic renoscintigraphy was made in 27 patients with unilateral diseases of the kidneys complicated by nephrogenic hypertension. The above pharmacotest allows the hypotensive effect of operation to be prognosed by the dynamics of the average arterial pressure, plasma renin and blood aldosterone activity as well as by the dynamics of the rate of glomerular filtration and efficient renal plasma flow in the contralateral kidney.", 
    "545": "The influence of the ACE-inhibitors captopril and lisinopril on parasympathetic activity in normotensive subjects was evaluated. Three cardiovascular tests which explored chiefly parasympathetic function (deep breathing, lying to standing and Valsalva test) were performed in 10 normotensive volunteers (mean age 26.1 years) in both basal conditions and after four days of treatment with either captopril (25 mg twice a day) or lisinopril (20 mg once a day). Mean blood pressure was not influenced by captopril, whereas it was significantly lowered with lisinopril (from 94.4 +/- 6.8 to 88.7 +/- 5.7 mmHg; p < 0.05). Neither drug interfered with heart rate or with the results of the deep breathing and Valsalva tests. The 30/15 ratio, an index of heart rate variability during the lying to standing test, significantly worsened after assumption of both captopril (from 1.37 +/- 0.18 to 1.21 +/- 0.14; p < 0.05) and lisinopril (from 1.31 +/- 0.17 to 1.20 +/- 0.11; p < 0.05). Although our subjects had a lisinopril-induced drop in blood pressure, their heart rate remained steady. This finding confirms previous studies reporting the lack of reflex tachycardia during ACE-inhibition. The slight effect of ACE-inhibitors on the results of deep breathing and Valsalva tests suggests that such drugs do not directly stimulate vagal activity; the significant decrease of the 30/15 ratio may be due to a functional impairment of the baroreflex mechanism.", 
    "546": "A new non-invasive ultrasonic device was developed to characterize the biomechanical properties of medium and large peripheral arteries. Simultaneous recordings of internal diameter and blood pressure over the whole cardiac cycle are used to establish compliance-pressure curves. Since blood pressure, which is an inherent co-determinant of arterial compliance, is taken into account, the comparison of arteries from patients with markedly different blood pressures has become possible. In a first study, the effects of three different antihypertensive drugs (20 mg lisinopril, 100 mg atenolol, 20 mg nitrendipine administered once a day) on arterial compliance and distensibility were investigated in young healthy volunteers.", 
    "547": "After 8 days of treatment, lisinopril induced a significant increase in arterial compliance. Subsequently, we compared the mechanical behaviour of arteries from newly diagnosed hypertensive patients (radial artery) or the carotid artery from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) with that of corresponding arteries in normotensive counterparts. No decrease in arterial distensibility was found in the hypertensive groups over the measured blood pressure range. This result is not totally consistent with previous in vitro or in situ localized studies. Methodological differences, the absence of blood flow and/or denervation may partly explain these contradictory results. Finally, we tested the effects of hydralazine (5 mg/day) and captopril (25 mg/day), administered for 6 weeks in drinking water, on the behaviour of the carotid arteries of 16-week-old SHR. The two drugs effectively reduced blood pressure while shifting the distensibility-pressure curves upward in comparison to the placebo-treated animals, suggesting an improvement in arterial compliance.",

Under the same experimental conditions, saralasin increased carotid compliance by 24% in WKY rats and 23% in SHR relative to control values (P less than 0.05 and P less than 0.001, respectively). Removal of the endothelium induced significant increases in carotid compliance in WKY rats (17%, P less than 0.01) and in SHR (33%, P less than 0.001). After removal of the endothelium, there was no further increase in carotid compliance with lisinopril in either strain. In contrast, saralasin induced further significant compliance increases in both strains (+18%, P less than 0.001, and +11%, P less than 0.01, in WKY and SHR, respectively). After the artery had been poisoned with potassium cyanide, there was no further increase in compliance relative to values obtained with saralasin in either strain with or without the endothelium.",

The inhibitory effects of 6366A on all tissue ACEs from SHRs and WKYs were the most potent among these compounds.

In addition, a very high density of punctate binding was observed interspersed between diffuse moderate labelling in the adventitia. Immunoreactivity was confined to the endothelium of both the intima and the vasa vasorum of the adventitia. The immunostaining correlated well with the autoradiography. The ACE inhibitors lisinopril and perindoprilat displayed similar high affinities in competing for the binding of 125I-351A to the endothelium and adventitia of the sheep aorta, suggesting that at these two sites the radioligand was binding to ACE.", 
    "558": "We find that ACE in the adventitia of large blood vessels is confined to the vaso vasorum. The results of this study help to explain the findings of many studies that ACE activity persists in endothelium-denuded blood vessels and also reveals a source of ACE distant from the luminal endothelial surface.", 
    "559": "We reported earlier that the vasodilator response to acetylcholine (ACh) in lungs exposed to indomethacin and preconstricted with an analog of thromboxane (U46619) is converted to vasoconstriction by brief electrolysis of inflowing perfusion medium and suggested that this effect reflected endothelial injury. The purpose of our present study was 2-fold. First, because captopril, a sulfhydryl-containing inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, prevented this effect (we assumed by scavenging electrolysis generated free radicals of oxygen), we determined whether two angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors lacking this moiety, namely lisinopril and ramiprilat, provided similar protection. Second, we studied whether electrolysis, like other forms of experimental lung injury, impaired uptake of serotonin (5-HT) by the endothelium. Our study confirmed that within 5 min of electrolytic injury, the ACh response is converted to vasoconstriction. This effect was completely prevented by lisinopril (18 microM) or ramiprilat (30 microM), neither of which affected ACh vasodilatation in control lungs. Lower concentrations of either drug exerted lesser degrees of protection. Five or 20 min after electrolysis, single-pass uptake of [14C]5-HT was significantly (P less than .01; N = 11) lower than control (82.4 +/- 3.4% vs. 71 +/- 3.2 and 46.5 +/- 6%, respectively). In contrast, 5-HT uptake was unaltered by electrolysis in the presence of 18 microM lisinopril. We conclude that loss of ACh vasodilation is an early reflection of lung endothelial injury that is accompanied by reduced [14C]5-HT uptake. Also, the protective property of nonsulfhydryl-containing angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may be related to unexpected antioxidant actions.", 
    "560": "The renovascular hypertension of an elderly patient, which was controlled initially with standard-dose therapy with captopril, later responded only to 75 mg given every 3 h without side effects. Changeover to another class of antihypertensives, as is recommended in recalcitrant cases, was not needed. Convenient maintenance therapy with lisinopril (10 mg twice daily) has kept blood pressure under control for a year.", 
    "561": "The contribution of endogenous kinins to the chronic antihypertensive effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors was investigated in two-kidney, one clip hypertensive Wistar rats, using the new bradykinin B2-receptor antagonist HOE 140 (D-Arg, [Hyp3, Thi5, D-Tic7, Oic8]-bradykinin). In a first protocol, rats were pretreated orally with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril (1 mg/kg per day), for 4 weeks. Acute blockade of bradykinin receptors by intravenous injections of HOE 140 at doses of 8.4 and 100 micrograms/kg, which inhibited the depressor responses to exogenous bradykinin, did not affect the antihypertensive effect of ramipril in these animals. Bradykinin receptors were then blocked chronically by subcutaneous infusion of HOE 140 (500 micrograms/kg per day) via osmotic minipumps for 6 weeks, while ramipril treatment was continued. HOE 140 partially reversed the antihypertensive effect of ramipril from 115.3 +/- 4.6 to 123.8 +/- 3.3 mm Hg (mean arterial blood pressure) after 3 weeks and to 121.3 +/- 2.9 mm Hg after 6 weeks. In contrast, in controls (ramipril plus subcutaneous vehicle infusion) mean arterial blood pressure decreased further from 112.0 +/- 6.0 to 110.3 +/- 4.9 mm Hg after 3 weeks and to 103.7 +/- 5.0 mm Hg after 6 weeks (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.01, HOE 140 versus controls). Plasma catecholamines were not significantly different between the two groups at the end of the experiment, indicating that the partial reversal of the antihypertensive effect was not due to a bradykinin-like agonistic effect on catecholamine release.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "562": "Angioedema has been reported to occur in association with all angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors used in the United States. We reviewed nine cases of angioedema associated with lisinopril use seen in the emergency department at our hospital among 1,970 patients that had been prescribed lisinopril from March 1989 to May 1990. Cases were considered as probably (six cases) or possibly (three cases) drug related, depending on the temporal relationship of the initiation of therapy and the onset of angioedema. All of the cases had edema of the lips, buccal mucosa, and or face. None presented with laryngeal edema or stridor. The angioedema resolved within 1 to 2 days with diphenhydramine treatment and discontinuation of lisinopril. Our data suggest that the incidence of angioedema associated with lisinopril is greater than that associated with captopril or enalapril.", 
    "563": "Studies were designed to investigate the mechanisms underlying the augmentation by angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors of the endothelium-dependent relaxations evoked by bradykinin. Isometric tension, tissue levels of cGMP, and transmembrane potential were measured in isolated canine coronary arteries as indications of the respective contribution of nitric oxide and endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor. In rings of coronary artery with endothelium, relaxations to bradykinin were potentiated by the ACE inhibitors cilazaprilat and perindoprilat. NG-Nitro-L-arginine (NLA), a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, impaired relaxations to bradykinin. But the presence of ACE inhibitors partially restored this activity. Bradykinin stimulated the production of cGMP, and this was enhanced significantly by ACE inhibitors, indicating an augmented release of nitric oxide. NLA abolished the increase induced by bradykinin irrespective of the presence of ACE inhibitors. Electrophysiological studies revealed that bradykinin elicited an endothelium-dependent hyperpolarization of vascular smooth muscle that was insensitive to NLA and potentiated by ACE inhibitors. The bradykinin-induced hyperpolarization and NLA-resistant relaxations were transient and impaired by potassium depolarization. Thus, production of endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor may account for the NLA-resistant relaxations of canine coronary arteries. The relaxations induced by bradykinin were unaffected by the B1 kinin receptor antagonist des-Arg9,[Leu8]-bradykinin either in the absence or in the presence of NLA but were antagonized by the B2 kinin receptor antagonist D-Arg[Hyp3,D-Phe7]-bradykinin. Molecular exclusion chromatography of 125I-labeled [Tyr8]-bradykinin and its degradation products demonstrated that the breakdown of the kinin by isolated coronary arteries was prevented in the presence of perindoprilat.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "564": "The short-term hemodynamic effects of intravenous enalaprilat were assessed in 26 infants and children, aged 6 months to 15 years, with intracardiac shunts undergoing cardiac catheterization. Pulmonary and systemic pressure, flow, and resistance indices were measured by the direct Fick method before and 30 min after enalaprilat at 0.06 mg/kg. Aortic and pulmonary artery pressure decreased 15 and 20%, respectively, by 10 min, with little further change at 30 min. The heart rate did not change significantly and there was no reduction in systemic flow. In those with a large ventricular septal defect and normal or near-normal pulmonary resistance (less than 3.5 u.m2, n = 8), the mean pulmonary-systemic flow ratio decreased from 2.9 +/- 0.3 to 2.4 +/- 0.3 (p less than 0.05) and the mean left-to-right shunt from 7.4 +/- 0.8 to 5.9 +/- 0.7 L/min/m2 (p less than 0.02). Those with an elevated pulmonary vascular resistance (greater than 5 u.m2, n = 8) showed a varied response. Two children, both with Down's syndrome, an atrioventricular canal defect, and reversible pulmonary hypertension (as assessed by an infusion of isoproterenol), had no decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance with enalaprilat. There were no adverse effects. Converting enzyme inhibitors may benefit \"heart failure\" associated with large ventricular septal defects and normal or mildly elevated pulmonary resistance.", 
    "565": "Skin blood flow and microvascular resistance were measured in the feet of hypertensive and normotensive subjects by the non-invasive transient thermal clearance method. Skin blood flow decreased and microvascular resistance increased as a function of systolic brachial blood pressure for the non-diabetic subjects who were not treated by vasoactive medication. The relationship between blood flow and systolic blood pressure for diabetic patients and for patients who were treated by enalapril was poor. The average resistance for non-diabetic patients treated by enalapril was lower than that of untreated non-diabetic subjects. For diabetic patients no significant difference in resistance between enalapril treated and untreated patients was found. The results demonstrate that for non-diabetic patients the role of microvascular resistance in hypertension is significant while it is less important in diabetic patients.", 
    "566": "In 2K,1C-RHR (two-kidney, one-clip hypertensive rats) serotonergic mechanisms in blood platelets were studied. The endogenous serotonin (5-HT) concentration in whole blood and in platelets remained unchanged in relation to the sham operated rats. Also the uptake of labelled 5-HT in rats with renal hypertension was not altered. However platelets aggregability was increased in 2K,1C-RHR. Acute administration of captopril (10 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg po) diminished blood pressure but did not change either the concentration of 5-HT in whole blood and in platelets of hypertensive rats or the uptake of this amine. Platelets aggregation and the amplifying effect of 5-HT in hypertensive rats were also unchanged after acute captopril administration. Similar results were observed after its administration in a dose of 30 mg/kg for one week. Our results indicate that captopril did not affect the platelets serotonergic mechanisms in 2K,1C-RHR.", 
    "567": "In anaesthetized and ventilated guinea-pigs, i.v. injection of 1 nmol/kg big endothelin-1 (big ET-1) did not evoke significant changes in pulmonary inflation pressure (PIP) and mean arterial blood pressure (MBP), whereas injection of the same dose of endothelin-1 (ET-1) induced marked and rapid bronchoconstrictor and pressor responses. Administered at the dose of 10 nmol/kg, big ET-1 provoked significant increases in PIP and MBP, which developed slowly and were long-lasting as compared to those evoked by ET-1. When big ET-1 was incubated for 45 min at 37 degrees C with alpha-chymotrypsin (2 mU/nmol) or pepsin (1 microgram/nmol) and then injected into guinea-pigs at the dose of 1 nmol/kg, marked bronchoconstrictor and pressor responses were observed, with kinetics similar to those noted after administration of the same dose of ET-1. The magnitude of the alpha-chymotrypsin- or pepsin-treated big ET-1 responses was similar to that induced by ET-1, incubated or not with the enzymes. Injected i.v. at the dose of 5 mg/kg, 5 min before the challenge, phosphoramidon almost totally inhibited the bronchoconstrictor and pressor responses induced by 10 nmol/kg big ET-1, whereas thiorphan (5 mg/kg) partially reduced the increase in PIP and exerted a minimal effect on the changes in MBP. Administered at the dose of 20 mg/kg per os, 1 h before i.v. administration of 10 nmol/kg big ET-1, enalapril maleate and captopril did not significantly alter the bronchoconstriction and the hypertensive response evoked by the peptide.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "568": "The serotonin (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE) system participate in the control of behavioural functions. The experiments were aimed at the question whether the NE system of the locus coeruleus interferes with the 5-HT activity of the nucleus raphe dorsalis and of which receptors are possibly involved. The alpha 1- and beta-adrenoceptor agonists methoxamine and isoproterenol, as well as a high dose (600 micrograms/kg i.p.) of the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine, increased extraneuronal 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) levels in the nucleus raphe dorsalis as measured by in vivo voltammetry. In contrast, a low dose (60 micrograms/kg i.p.) of clonidine and the alpha 1-, alpha 2- and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, prazosin, piperoxane, and atenolol, reduced the 5-HIAA concentration. In the locus coeruleus, the origin of NE projections to the nucleus raphe dorsalis, clonidine decreased whereas piperoxane enhanced extracellular 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), an index of NE metabolism in the locus coeruleus. The results suggest that 5-HT neurotransmission in the nucleus raphe dorsalis is stimulated by the NE system of the locus coeruleus and that adrenoceptor drugs may affect 5-HT neuronal activity in addition to NE neurotransmission.", 
    "569": "To investigate the role of local renin angiotensin systems in the functional responses to angiotensin I and II, the effects of angiotensin I and angiotensin II on resistance were measured in perfused hindlimbs of rats under normal conditions and during infusion of enalaprilate, lisinopril, zabiciprilate and captopril at two infusion rates. The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors significantly increased ED50 and decreased maximal resistance changes of angiotensin I dose dependently, without effects on angiotensin II responses. Captopril increased the ED50 of angiotensin I significantly more than did the other ACE inhibitors at a low infusion rate. The ACE inhibitors, except for lisinopril, increased the ED50 of angiotensin I pressor responses in vivo to the same extent, and were similarly potent to inhibit plasma ACE activity at 15 min after injection. The ratio of the doses of the ACE inhibitors used in vivo was the same as in perfused hindlimbs. These results suggest that, in the hindlimbs, angiotensin I causes ACE-dependent vasoconstriction. Captopril may be more effective to inhibit local ACE than the other ACE inhibitors investigated.", 
    "570": "A randomized double-blind trial was conducted in 36 leisure-time sportsmen (mean age 40.1 +/- 5.4 years) with mild or moderate essential hypertension (WHO groups I or II) to find out whether an 8-week antihypertensive treatment with daily 10-20 mg enalapril or 100-200 mg metoprolol changed their exercise performance. This was measured by bicycle spiroergometry together with determination of lactate levels, before and at the end of the treatment period. Maximal oxygen uptake rose by 1.86 ml/kg.min during enalapril administration and by 1.06 ml/kg.min at the individual anaerobic threshold. But under metoprolol these parameters fell by 6.57 ml/kg.min and 4.61 ml/kg.min, respectively. After treatment with these two drugs 3 and 15 patients, respectively, had the sensation of greater exercise performance at identical exercise levels. The differences in exercise between the two drugs using the stated three primary criteria were statistically significant. The Watt-time product decreased in only one of the patients of the enalapril group, but in 17 of the metoprolol group. Only metoprolol significantly reduced exercise heart rate. Both drugs caused a similar fall in systolic blood pressure during exercise.", 
    "571": "The action of a kinin-potentiating peptide (KPP) obtained from tryptic digestion of human serum proteins was compared with that of bradykinin-potentiating peptide 9a (BPP9a; obtained from snake venom) and enalaprilat (a synthetic inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme; ACE) as a means of understanding the mechanism of action of KPP on smooth muscle. KPP potentiated bradykinin-induced contractile effects in guinea-pig ileum and rat uterus, but not the bradykinin-induced relaxation of pre-contracted ileum, whereas BPP9a and enalaprilat potentiated both bradykinin effects. The receptor mediating both the contraction and the relaxation elicited by bradykinin in the ileum was found to be of the B2 type. KPP retained its potentiating effect in the presence of enalaprilat in the guinea-pig ileum and rat uterus, whereas the potentiation evoked by BPP9a was abolished. Enalaprilat inhibited the activity of purified ACE, whereas KPP was completely devoid of such an effect. The potentiating effect of KPP, but not that of BPP9a or enalaprilat, was blocked by compounds that inhibit phospholipase A2 and lipoxygenase activity but not by inhibitors of cyclo-oxygenase or phosphodiesterases. The results suggest that the potentiating effect of KPP (i) does not involve inhibition of ACE; (ii) is not due to an increased affinity of the receptor for bradykinin, and (iii) probably involves post-receptor events linked to phospholipase A2 and to the lipoxygenase pathway.", 
    "572": "The hemodynamic determinants of clinical status in patients with left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction have not been established. In the present study, preload reserve--LV distension during exercise--was related to clinical status, and the effect of acute angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition was examined in 97 patients with ejection fraction less than or equal to 0.35 enrolled in the trial, Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD). Sixty-one asymptomatic patients (group I) were compared with 36 patients with symptomatic heart failure (group II). Radionuclide LV volumes were measured at rest and during maximal cycle exercise. Group II patients had higher resting heart rates, end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes, and lower ejection fractions (all p less than 0.005). During exercise, only patients in group I had increased stroke volume (from 35 +/- 8 to 39 +/- 11 ml/m2 [mean +/- SD; p less than 0.0005]) due to an increase in end-diastolic volume (from 119 +/- 29 to 126 +/- 29 ml/m2 [p less than 0.0005]), contributing to a greater increase in LV minute output (p less than 0.0001, group I vs group II). After administration of intravenous enalapril (1.25 mg), LV end-diastolic volume response to exercise was augmented in group II (rest, 140 +/- 42; exercise, 148 +/- 43 ml/m2; p less than 0.0005) and LV output response increased slightly (p less than 0.05). Thus, in patients with asymptomatic systolic dysfunction, recruitment of preload during exercise is responsible for maintaining a stroke volume contribution to the cardiac output response.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "573": "The effect of quinapril on blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR) and their variabilities in 12 patients with severe congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association class III and IV) was assessed using ambulatory electrocardiographic and intraarterial monitoring. Mean +/- standard deviation daytime BP was 122/75 +/- 20/15 mm Hg at baseline and 113/70 +/- 13/16 mm Hg after 16 weeks of therapy with quinapril (p greater than 0.05 for systolic and diastolic BP); mean nighttime BP was 114/69 +/- 19/14 mm Hg at baseline and 107/69 +/- 15/14 mm Hg with quinapril (p greater than 0.05 for systolic and diastolic BP). Mean daytime HR was unchanged but nighttime HR was reduced from 77 +/- 11 to 71 +/- 10 beats/min, p = 0.02. HR variability (difference between the 75th and 25th percentiles of the frequency distribution of RR intervals) increased from 91 +/- 34 to 134 +/- 47 ms, p = 0.008. The variability of successive differences between RR intervals also increased significantly (75th to 25th percentile = 17 +/- 4 ms at baseline and 31 +/- 26 ms with quinapril, p = 0.02). Long-term quinapril caused clinically unimportant decreases in BP in patients with severe congestive heart failure. An increase in vagal activity caused by the reduction in circulating angiotensin II may account for the effect of converting enzyme inhibition on HR and its variability.", 
    "574": "ACE inhibitors elicit the release of endothelium-derived relaxing factors in perfused isolated canine arteries (Mombouli and Vanhoutte, J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1991, 18: 926-927); this action is antagonized by bradykinin-receptor antagonists suggesting that it is mediated by local kinin generation. The effects of exogenous tissular kallikrein (porcine) were examined in vitro in the isolated canine coronary artery. Isometric tension was measured in blood vessel rings (with and without endothelium) contracted with prostaglandin F2 alpha. The kallikrein elicited relaxations in rings with, but not in those without, endothelium. This response was augmented by the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor perindoprilat, and it was antagonized by the selective B2-kinin receptor antagonist HOE 140 and aprotinin, an inhibitor of tissular kallikrein. These data suggest that in the canine coronary artery, kallikrein causes relaxations that may be mediated by kinins generated from endogenous kininogens present in the vascular wall.", 
    "575": "Earlier studies on the cardiovascular effects of intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors implicate angiotensin II (AII) present in the central nervous system in the pathogenesis of hypertension. We have now examined whether central AII contributes to the maintenance of established hypertension in adult stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP). The ACE inhibitor, enalaprilat, was infused i.c.v. for two weeks at a rate of 5 micrograms/h via osmotic minipumps. Control rats were either untreated or infused with saline. Mean arterial pressure (MAP), measured via an indwelling catheter, fell within 24 h in the enalaprilat-treated rats and remained at least 30 mmHg lower than in controls. This difference persisted after intravenous (i.v.) administration of a vasopressin (AVP) antagonist but was eliminated by subsequent ganglion blockade with i.v. pentolinium. Without prior administration of the AVP antagonist, however, the reductions of MAP after pentolinium were smaller. The reduction was still attenuated in treated rats compared with controls but there was a significant difference in the residual MAP. Circulating catecholamine levels were reduced by central ACE inhibition. However, pressor responsiveness to i.v. phenylephrine was unaffected. The results suggest that, in SHRSP, central ACE inhibition lowers blood pressure by reducing sympathetic outflow, implying that central AII has a tonic sympathoexcitatory effect in this strain.", 
    "576": "Although digitalis glycosides were introduced in the treatment of cardiac maladies greater than 200 years ago, controversy persists regarding the precise role of digoxin in any multidrug approach to the treatment of congestive heart failure (CHF). Despite its widespread use for more than 2 centuries, only recently have double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials of digoxin therapy been conducted in patients with moderate CHF and sinus rhythm. These trials demonstrate that digoxin is superior to placebo in improving left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction, increasing exercise capacity, and preventing CHF worsening. Digoxin produces benefits similar to those seen with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors with regard to clinical compensation and improvement in LV function. However, improved survival is demonstrated only in response to ACE inhibitors. The recently completed RADIANCE study addresses the value of combining digoxin with ACE inhibitor therapy in patients with mild-to-moderate CHF. Because increased mortality has been reported with the newer oral inotropic agents, it currently appears that digoxin is the only oral inotropic agent useful in clinical practice in the treatment of CHF. However, the effects of digoxin on mortality in patients with CHF remain unknown. In the large, double-blind, randomized trial conducted by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, the effects of digoxin on mortality in patients with CHF and already being treated with ACE inhibitors are currently being evaluated. Presently, based on the results of placebo-controlled studies, it appears that digoxin, alone or in combination with ACE inhibitors, is beneficial in patients with any signs or symptoms of CHF due to systolic LV dysfunction.", 
    "577": "Therapeutic approaches to the management of heart failure have traditionally focused on shortterm hemodynamic and symptomatic goals, but present evidence suggests that most therapeutic decisions have long-term consequences. Treatment may change the rate of disease progression, modify the need for additional therapy, influence the number of hospitalizations, and alter the risk of death. However, there may be little relation between a drug's short-term effect on cardiac function or cardiovascular symptoms and its long-term effect on survival. Some therapeutic interventions favorably influence the outcome of patients with heart failure, even though they exert negative inotropic effects; others adversely affect the outcome of patients, even though they markedly improve cardiac performance. This discordance might be explained if the most important predictor of response to a therapeutic intervention in heart failure were the effect of the pharmacologic agent on neurohormonal systems rather than on hemodynamic variables. In general, drugs that decrease the effects of the sympathetic nervous system (digitalis glycosides) and the renin-angiotensin system (angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors) reduce the risk of worsening heart failure. Conversely, drugs that potentiate the effects, or increase the activity, of the sympathetic nervous system (phosphodiesterase inhibitors) or the renin-angiotensin system (calcium antagonists) increase cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. These observations suggest that physicians should no longer focus on short-term hemodynamic or symptomatic goals in the treatment of heart failure but, instead, should manage patients to improve both the quality and quantity of life.", 
    "578": "In recent years there have been encouraging developments in the therapy for congestive heart failure. Vasodilator therapy, as an adjunct to digitalis and diuretics, has made a major impact. Vasodilator therapy results in improved left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction, improved functional capacity, and enhanced quality of life. When an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor is used, several studies published since 1988 show that these improvements are accompanied by improved survival. Yet many questions remain. Principal among these is how to approach the patient who has significantly depressed LV function, but is asymptomatic or has only minimal symptoms. In these patients the prognosis cannot be based on New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, but must reflect objective measurements of ventricular function. Any intervention should be specifically designed to improve survival, since functional capacity and quality of life are apparently unimpaired. On the other hand, there are no data at present to suggest that intervention in these patients will improve survival. This article considers the evaluation of such asymptomatic patients and potential therapeutic approaches. These are the use of cardiac glycosides, the use of ACE inhibitors, or their combination. Circumstantial evidence supporting their use in this select patient population is considered. It is stressed that any decision to intervene therapeutically in the asymptomatic patient must be made by the physician on an individual basis.", 
    "579": "A stability-indicating high performance liquid chromatographic method has been proposed to quantify captopril. The method has been used to determine the stability of captopril in oral liquid dosage forms prepared from either commercially available tablets or powder. The dosage forms in water were more stable than when the vehicle was a syrup. Furthermore, the dosage form prepared using powder in water was more stable than when tablets were used. While the decomposition of captopril followed first-order equation when the dosage forms were prepared in syrup (in two of the three solutions studied), this equation was not followed when water was the vehicle. This is probably due to an uncontrolled factor, oxygen, because captopril is very sensitive to oxidation. Captopril solution prepared in water using tablets was stable for about 20 days when stored at 5 degrees C, and that prepared using powder in water was stable for about 27 days. One commercial syrup hastened the process of decomposition with an additional unidentified product of decomposition.", 
    "580": "The effect of enalapril alone and in combination with nadolol on resting and exercising blood pressure, heart rate, plasma renin activity, aldosterone, noradrenaline, and potassium levels was studied in 10 hypertensive patients (diastolic blood pressure between 95 and 114 mmHg). Patients received placebo for 4 weeks, enalapril (mean daily dose 24.5 mg) for 8 weeks, and nadolol, 40 mg once daily, was added for the remaining 8 weeks of the study. Exercise testing (modified Bruce, treadmill) was conducted at the end of the placebo run-in phase and at the end of each treatment period. Enalapril reduced resting and exercising blood pressure independent of any change in heart rate: This effect was increased with combination treatment. Plasma renin activity at rest and during exercise was increased by enalapril. Combination treatment attenuated this response and significantly reduced plasma aldosterone. Neither treatment had any effect on plasma noradrenaline levels. Resting plasma potassium levels were increased with combination treatment, whereas both treatment regimens increased plasma potassium levels during exercise. There were no clinically relevant episodes of hyperkalemia. Further investigation is required to qualify the nature of the blood pressure and plasma potassium response with combination treatment.", 
    "581": "The Authors describe a clinical case of a patient affected by arterial hypertension of severe degree (IV grade OMS) that during therapy with ACE inhibitors and diuretics developed acute renal failure that reversed after stopping treatment. The clinical course was quite similar to acute renal failure induced by ACE inhibitors and diuretics in patient with bilateral renal artery stenosis. In interpreting the pathogenesis, the Authors suppose, beside a reductions of effective plasma flow, the coexistence of hyalinosis of renal arterioles. They underline the necessity of monitoring renal function at least in the first weeks of therapy when a treatment with ACE inhibitors and diuretics is started especially in patients with hypertension of high degree and/or reduced renal function.", 
    "582": "Transgenic rats harboring the mouse ren-2 gene develop severe hypertension in association with suppressed kidney and plasma renin levels. Extra-renal expression of the ren-2 gene occurs in a number of sites, and is particularly high in the adrenal cortex. We have investigated the response of blood pressure and heart rate in ren-2 rats to acute converting enzyme inhibition and to sodium depletion. In response to a single dose of captopril (1 mg/kg i.p.), blood pressure in ren-2 rats was rapidly normalized, whereas normotensive Sprague-Dawley rats were relatively unresponsive to captopril. In response to the sodium depletion protocol (five days on low-sodium diet, with furosemide administered on day 1) both ren-2 rats and normotensive Sprague-Dawley rats underwent similar initial losses of sodium followed by a gradual return to net sodium balance. Diastolic pressure in ren-2 rats fell from 160 +/- 9 mm Hg to 105 +/- 10 mm Hg after 72 hours, whereas blood pressure in Sprague-Dawley rats was essentially unchanged. The response to captopril implies a major role for angiotensin II in sustaining hypertension, and this may result from tissue generation of angiotensin I. The response to sodium depletion suggests a volume-dependent component, which may result from elevated aldosterone levels, possibly due to enhanced adrenal renin expression.", 
    "583": "We have studied prospectively the acute blood pressure lowering effect on an oral dose of captopril, 25 mg in 240 hypertensive patients. The mean relative reduction of systolic and diastolic BP was 16 and 15% respectively and the mean time to the mean arterial pressure nadir was 59 minutes. Systolic BP fell by more than 30% in 4.6% of patients and diastolic BP and mean arterial pressure dropped by more than 30% in 4.2 and 3.3% of patients respectively. Patients over 60 years of age showed a significantly larger fall in systolic and diastolic BP. Patients with renal artery stenosis reached the BP nadir in a significantly shorter time compared with patients with essential hypertension (50.5 vs. 59.7 minutes, P less than 0.05) and showed a significantly larger fall in systolic BP (20.7 vs. 15.4%, P less than 0.05). A forward stepwise regression analysis showed that only baseline plasma renin activity had a significant relation to the fall in BP (P less than 0.01, R = 0.57). We conclude that according to our definition of a greater than 30% decrease of the mean arterial pressure, a first dose hypotension after captopril was seen in 3.3% of 240 patients. Captopril treatment should be introduced carefully since not all those patients at risk of hypotension can be identified in advance.", 
    "584": "We have compared the cardiovascular and metabolic responses to five different ACE inhibitors in 86 patients matched for age, body mass index, blood pressure, fasting plasma glucose and insulin levels in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover, randomised trial. In the active drug treatment phase the patients were randomly assigned to one of five ACE inhibitors: captopril (75 mg/day; n = 16); enalapril (20 mg/day; n = 14); quinapril (20 mg/day; n = 17); ramipril (5 mg/day; n = 21) and lisinopril (20 mg/day; n = 18). Placebo and ACE inhibition phases lasted two weeks and were separated by a one week wash-out period. At the end of each treatment period blood pressure and heart rate were recorded and a fasting sample intravenous glucose tolerance test was conducted. Our study demonstrated that ACE inhibition significantly reduces blood pressure and improves insulin sensitivity. All the ACE inhibitors studied had similar cardiovascular responses but lisinopril displayed the larger metabolic response.", 
    "585": "To determine whether calcium entry is necessary for insulin antinatriuresis, urinary sodium excretion was determined before and during euglycemic insulin administration in rats receiving verapamil (10 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) or vehicle. In vehicle rats, insulin reduced sodium excretion from 2.7 +/- 0.5 to 0.98 +/- 0.2 mu eq/min (P less than 0.05) without altering arterial pressure or inulin clearance. Insulin did not reduce sodium excretion in rats receiving verapamil. Baseline mean arterial pressure was lower in verapamil rats than in vehicle rats. To exclude the possibility that lower baseline arterial pressures prevented insulin antinatriuresis, insulin's effect on sodium excretion was determined in rats receiving captopril at a dose that reduced arterial pressure to the level observed in verapamil rats, and in verapamil rats with angiotensin II levels fixed to maintain arterial pressure equivalent to vehicle rats. In captopril rats, insulin reduced (P less than 0.05) sodium excretion from 1.07 +/- 0.3 to 0.3 +/- 0.01 mu eq/min, even though arterial pressure was not different from that in verapamil rats. Insulin failed to reduce sodium excretion in verapamil rats receiving angiotensin II. Thus verapamil prevents insulin antinatriuresis by renal mechanisms related to inhibition of calcium entry. Additionally, insulin antinatriuresis is independent of angiotensin II.", 
    "586": "The non-sulfhydryl selective angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor benazepril (20 mg daily) was compared with hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg daily) in post-infarction (6-24 months) patients with symptomatic (NYHA functional class 2) mild heart failure. No concomitant drug therapy was given. The study had a double-blind cross-over design with 3-month treatment periods. Both drugs were well tolerated, and both caused a similar reduction in systolic blood pressure. Heart rate was higher with the diuretic. Benazepril improved the NYHA functional class in 17 out of 29 (59%) patients, whereas one patient improved with hydrochlorothiazide (P = 0.0004). With regard to global efficacy score, benazepril was also superior. Thus, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may be superior to diuretics as first-choice therapy in symptomatic mild heart failure.", 
    "587": "The effects of captopril on myocardial segment function in different degrees of transient coronary occlusion were studied using ultrasonic dimension gauges in 15 open-chest dogs. The occlusion procedures (OP) were performed on the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) in eight dogs and on the left circumflex coronary artery (Cx) in seven dogs. To measure the changes in segment shortening in the subendocardium we used eight dogs (ischemic and control zones: four dogs LAD and four dogs Cx). To measure the changes in wall thickening we used seven dogs (ischemic and control zones: three dogs LAD and four dogs Cx). Total coronary OP lasting 1 min and partial OP (70-80%) lasting 1 min and 2 min 30 s, before and after captopril (0.25 mg/kg i.v.) were performed. Left ventricular pressure, dP/dt, coronary flow, and ECG were monitored. Total coronary OP (1 min) changed segment shortening (18% LAD; 14% Cx) and wall thickening (19% LAD; 18% Cx) to values of dyskinesis (-3% and -4% for shortening; -6% and -5% for thickening). Captopril improved regional function maintaining positive values for shortening (4% LAD; 3% Cx) and thickening (0.3% LAD; 4% Cx). Similar responses were obtained during partial OP and captopril. Results suggest that captopril produced a significant improvement in the regional function parameters affected by ischemia both in total and partial obstructions.", 
    "588": "ACE inhibitors have been available by prescription since the marketing of captopril in the early 1980s. Since that time, six additional ACE inhibitors have been marketed, four of which received approval from the Food and Drug Association in 1991. All but one of the new ACE inhibitors are carboxylic-acid compounds, and all of them maintain a pro-drug metabolic pathway. Initially, ACE inhibitors were approved only for the control of high blood pressure. More recently, captopril and enalapril have been approved for use in congestive heart failure. In 1988, ACE inhibitors were one of the recommended first-line therapies for mild-to-moderate hypertension. Their use in patients with hypertension has steadily increased, most likely because of their minimal effect on coexistent cardiovascular risk factors. In CHF, ACE inhibitors are the only single drug class that has been shown to reduce mortality and hospitalizations due to the disease without concomitant administration of another drug. ACE inhibitors are clearly drugs that should be used early in the treatment of most patients with CHF. Differences between ACE inhibitors are often difficult to define. As information regarding the clinical utility of tissue ACE inhibition is unveiled, the ability to use a selected ACE inhibitor based on individual patient characteristics may increase. The future for ACE inhibition looks promising and the cumulative clinical value of ACE inhibition appears to be just beginning.", 
    "589": "To present evidence that enalapril and captopril may produce hepatotoxicity by a common mechanism.", 
    "590": "A case report and review of pertinent literature.", 
    "591": "A patient developed hepatotoxicity once while taking enalapril and again while taking captopril. Hepatotoxicity resolved with cessation of therapy. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with use of captopril, enalapril, and lisinopril. Apparent cross-reactivity has been reported on just one other occasion.", 
    "592": "Because hepatotoxicity is uncommon with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, our observations suggest the possibility that these agents produce hepatotoxicity by a common mechanism. In patients who develop hepatotoxicity while taking one ACE inhibitor, other agents in this class probably should be avoided.", 
    "593": "1. The direct cardiac effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor in 22 hypertensive patients were investigated. Radionuclide ventriculography and echocardiography were performed to measure left ventricular function before and 60 min after administration of a subdepressor dose of captopril. 2. Since the response to ACE inhibitor is not uniform, patients were classified into 12 patients without significant blood pressure change following captopril (group I) and 10 patients with reduction of blood pressure (group II). 3. Clinical and baseline haemodynamic characteristics were similar for the two groups. 4. Ejection fraction (EF) increased without changes of heart rate and end-diastolic dimension after ACE inhibitor in group I as well as group II. The change of EF was not different for the two groups. No correlation was found between changes in EF and blood pressure in group I patients. 5. This study indicates that ACE inhibitor might directly influence left ventricular function independent of systemic haemodynamic changes.", 
    "594": "The properties of a novel nonpeptidic angiotensin II (AII) receptor antagonist, 2,5-dibutyl-2,4-dihydro-4-([2-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)(1,1'-biphenyl) -4'-yl]methyl)-3H-1,2,4-triazol-3-one (SC-51316), are described. SC-51316 inhibited [125I]AII binding selectively to the AT1 receptor with IC50 values of 3.6 and 5.1 nM in rat adrenal cortical and rat uterine membrane preparations, respectively. The compound was a competitive and reversible antagonist of AII-mediated contraction of rabbit aortic rings with a pA2 of 8.86. In addition, SC-51316 inhibited AII-induced aldosterone release from rat adrenal zona glomerulosa cells and blocked inhibition of renin release by AII from rat kidney slices with pA2 values of 8.62 and 8.9, respectively. The agent (0.1 mM) did not inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme or plasma renin activity. These data demonstrate that SC-51316 is a potent AII receptor antagonist which may prove to be useful as a pharmacologic tool for studying the role of the renin-angiotensin system in cardiovascular diseases.", 
    "595": "The pathophysiologic process of ventricular remodeling after AMI involves an alteration in myocardial cell contraction. The stretching and redistribution of myocardial cells in the ischemic area promote dyssynergic contraction and an overall reduction in ventricular function. Expansion of the infarcted area and volume-overload hypertrophy of the uninfarcted area remodel the shape of the ventricle. Ventricular enlargement and dilation are associated with early mortality and morbidity. This has prompted further study to identify measures that can attenuate the process. Limited investigation on human subjects suggests that ACE inhibition reduces ventricular wall stress and preserves ventricular shape and function. A multicenter trial, SAVE, is under way to study the effects of long-term captopril therapy for patients suffering from AMI. This study and future investigations will focus on inhibition of ventricular remodeling following AMI in the hope of reducing symptomatic CHF and mortality.", 
    "596": "Increasing evidence indicates that the adrenal cortex of most mammalian species expresses distinct forms of cytochrome P-450(11 beta), a steroidogenic enzyme that catalyses the terminal steps in the biosynthesis of both glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids. In the human, mouse, and rat, two genes have been isolated, designated CYP11B1 and CYP11B2. The product of CYP11B2 (aldosterone synthase) is required for the successive 11 beta-, 18-hydroxylations and 18-oxidation of deoxycorticosterone that lead to the production of aldosterone in the zona glomerulosa. In contrast, the product of CYP11B1 (11 beta-hydroxylase) mediates only the 11 beta-hydroxylation of deoxycorticosterone and 11-deoxycortisol. The recent identification of these two P-450(11 beta) isozymes mandates further analysis of their expression in different zones of the adrenal cortex, both under basal conditions and in response to conditions known to alter mineralocorticoid biosynthesis. To evaluate the expression of the two isozymes in different adrenocortical zones, we performed Northern blotting analyses with specific oligonucleotide probes that discriminated between the two forms of rat P-450(11 beta). The transcripts detected by the two probes were of similar size (2.7 kilobase), but differed in their zonal distribution: aldosterone synthase P-450 messenger RNA (mRNA) was detected only in zona glomerulosa, whereas 11 beta-hydroxylase P-450 was expressed in both zona fasciculata-reticularis and zona glomerulosa. Next, we analyzed the response of these two genes to various physiological and pharmacological interventions known to affect aldosterone biosynthesis. High potassium or low sodium diet given to rats for 1 week increased aldosterone synthase P-450 mRNA levels by approximately 5- and 6-fold, respectively. These increases, moreover, were significantly attenuated by treatment with captopril, an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme. In contrast, neither dietary manipulation significantly affected 11 beta-hydroxylase P-450 mRNA levels in any zone. Thus, stimulation of the terminal steps of aldosterone biosynthesis by variations in dietary intake of monovalent cations involves regulation of aldosterone synthase P-450 mRNA levels. Finally, captopril inhibited potassium induction of aldosterone synthase P-450 mRNA levels despite the presence of low plasma renin activity in the potassium-treated rats. This finding implicates intraadrenal angiotensin II formation in the effect of potassium on mineralocorticoid production.", 
    "597": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) are increasingly used in the treatment of cardiovascular disease, but recent reports have warned of some hemodynamic risk (hypotension and bradycardia) when associated with anesthesia. To assess the hemodynamic effects of induction of anesthesia in patients chronically treated with ACEIs, 16 hypertensive patients scheduled for coronary artery bypass graft surgery (n = 12) or vascular surgery (n = 4) were studied. Eight of them were chronically treated (for at least 1 mo) with ACEIs (ACEI group), and the remaining eight (control group) were treated with other classes of antihypertensive drugs. Induction of anesthesia, which consisted of flunitrazepam (0.03 mg/kg), fentanyl (0.006 mg/kg), and pancuronium (0.1 mg/kg) IV, was followed by a significant decrease in mean arterial blood pressure from baseline in both groups (by 16.8% in controls [P = 0.001] and 33.5% in ACEI-treated patients [P = 0.001] [P = 0.041 between groups]). In control patients, mean arterial blood pressure decrease was only associated with a significant decrease in cardiac index (-18%, P = 0.014). In ACEI-treated patients, the arterial blood pressure decreases were associated with consistent reductions in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (-26.4%; P = 0.035) and cardiac index (-23.9%; P = 0.001). Systemic vascular resistance index and heart rate were moderately changed (-14.2% and -4.5%, respectively). Rapid restoration of arterial blood pressure was obtained in all ACEI-treated patients, mainly with the intravenous administration of 0.4 to 0.7 L of lactated Ringer's solution. Phenylephrine (0.38 +/- 0.9 mg) was, however, required in four patients when mean arterial blood pressure was less than 60 mm Hg.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "598": "We have previously demonstrated that loss of renal functional reserve (renal response to protein loading) in two-kidney, one clip Goldblatt hypertension is characterized by no change in glomerular filtration rate or single nephron glomerular filtration rate and decreased absolute proximal tubular reabsorption during glycine administration. Captopril restores proximal reabsorption and renal functional reserve in this condition. Because captopril suppresses angiotensin II generation and increases bradykinin, prostaglandins, and potentially nitric oxide, we have investigated the role of angiotensin II blockade in restoring proximal reabsorption and renal functional reserve by comparing captopril with DuP 753, an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, in Goldblatt rats. One month after clipping, two period micropuncture studies (control and glycine) were performed on the unclipped kidney. Normal rats and three groups of clipped rats were studied: an untreated group (HYP), a group treated with captopril (CEI), and a group treated with DuP 753 (DuP) 5 days before micropuncture. Glycine increased glomerular filtration rate, nephron plasma flow, and single nephron glomerular filtration rate in normal rats. Systemic and glomerular hypertension in HYP rats was associated with loss of renal functional reserve and a decrease in absolute proximal reabsorption during glycine. Captopril and DuP 753 normalized systemic and glomerular capillary pressure and prevented the decrease in proximal reabsorption during glycine; however, only CEI rats increased single nephron glomerular filtration rate and glomerular filtration rate after glycine. In conclusion, abnormal responses of both glomerular and tubular function are responsible for the loss of renal functional reserve in Goldblatt rats. Inhibitory angiotensin II activity is responsible for decreasing proximal reabsorption during glycine; however, factors other than angiotensin II limit the glomerular response to glycine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "599": "Controversy exists whether vascular smooth muscle cells in vivo synthesize renin, thereby providing a critical component of the hypothesized vascular renin-angiotensin system. To examine this question, we enzymatically isolated and pooled the medial layer of thoracic aortas from Sprague-Dawley rats that were either untreated or enalapril treated for 3 days, isolated messenger RNA (mRNA), and performed Northern blot analysis with rat complementary DNA (cDNA) probes for renin, cathepsin D, and cathepsin E. Renin mRNA was detected in kidney but was not detected in aortic smooth muscle from the untreated or enalapril-treated groups. Cathepsin E mRNA was detected in enalapril-treated aorta and kidney, and cathepsin D mRNA was detected in all tissues examined. cDNA was synthesized and subjected to polymerase chain reaction analysis by using primers corresponding in sequence to regions conserved throughout the aspartic proteinases. Cathepsins D and E were amplified from kidney and aortic cDNA. Renin was less consistently amplified from the aortic cDNA and was much less abundant than cathepsin E or cathepsin D. These results suggest that 1) renin mRNA is present in aortic smooth muscle cells in vivo in quantities detectable only after multiple rounds of polymerase chain reaction amplification, 2) renin mRNA is not upregulated in aortic smooth muscle after converting enzyme inhibition, and 3) cathepsins D and E are the predominant aspartic proteinases in aortic smooth muscle.", 
    "600": "Endothelin-1 (ET-1), a potent vasoconstrictor peptide synthesized by the vascular smooth muscle endothelium, has been previously shown to produce a sustained, salt-sensitive elevation in mean arterial pressure when chronically infused over a 7-day period into male Sprague-Dawley rats. In addition to other physiological actions, ET-1 has been shown to have potent effects on various renal functions, including renin production. Activation of the renin-angiotensin system, therefore, may contribute to the pressor response induced by ET-1. In this investigation, captopril ([2S]-1-[3-mercapto-2-methylpropionyl]-L-proline), a sulfhydryl-containing angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor, was chronically administered to endothelin-infused rats to elucidate the role of the renin-angiotensin system in this animal model of hypertension. Rats were catheterized, housed in metabolic cages, and maintained on a fixed 6.0 meq.day-1 sodium intake throughout the experiment, with daily measurements taken of mean arterial pressure, heart rate, water intake, urine output, and urinary sodium and potassium excretions. Infusion of ET-1 alone at a rate of 5.0 pmol.kg-1.min-1 for 7 days was associated with a significant and sustained increase in mean arterial pressure; concomitant chronic administration of captopril in another group of rats at a rate of 1.0 mg.kg-1.hr-1 prevented the ET-1-induced hypertension. In an additional study, however, increases in plasma angiotensin II concentration were not observed in rats administered ET-1 alone at 5.0 pmol.kg-1.min-1. These results indicate that endothelin-induced hypertension may involve stimulation of the renin-angiotensin system but not an increase in circulating angiotensin II concentration.", 
    "601": "In vitro data indicate that the activation of A2 adenosine receptors increases renin release by the accumulation of cyclic AMP. Because in human forearm vessels beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation causes the local release of renin and angiotensin II through the increase of cyclic AMP, we evaluated in six essential hypertensive subjects whether adenosine can release vascular angiotensin II. Adenosine was infused into the brachial artery at cumulatively increasing doses (0.5, 1.5, and 5 micrograms/100 ml forearm tissue per minute for 5 minutes each) during saline infusion and in the presence of the adenosine antagonist theophylline (100 micrograms/100 ml forearm tissue per minute for 15 minutes), while venous (ipsilateral deep forearm vein) and arterial (brachial artery) angiotensin II (picograms per milliliter) were measured at the end of each infusion period, and forearm angiotensin II net balance (picograms per minute) was calculated by venous-arterial differences corrected for forearm blood flow (strain-gauge venous plethysmography) and hematocrit. In control conditions, adenosine, at higher doses, caused a dose-dependent vasodilation and increased venous angiotensin II without affecting arterial values; therefore, the calculated angiotensin II net balance showed an adenosine-mediated dose-dependent release. Theophylline pretreatment blunted adenosine-mediated forearm blood flow increments and angiotensin II release. The local origin of angiotensin II was further confirmed in another group of six hypertensive subjects in whom the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril, locally infused at the rate of 2.5 micrograms/100 ml forearm tissue per minute for 15 minutes, abolished the adenosine-mediated venous angiotensin II increments. Our data indicate that exogenous adenosine can stimulate the production of angiotensin II in the forearm vessels of hypertensive patients."
