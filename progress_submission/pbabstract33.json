    "0": "The main pathologic hallmark of systemic sclerosis (SSc) is endothelial derangement; the pathologic alterations of the vessel wall in SSc are strikingly similar to the modification detected in the atherosclerotic lesions, and it is now evident that SSc is also characterized by accelerated macrovascular disease. Peptides related to angiotensin II, the final product of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), play a role as regulators of endothelial cell function. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), the key enzyme in the RAS, is the predominant pathway of angiotensin II formation in blood and tissues. In intron 16 of the gene encoding for ACE an insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism, consisting of the presence or absence of a 287-base pair Alu sequence, has been identified. This polymorphism has been related to ACE enzyme levels, and data from experimental studies reported a functional role for this polymorphism in modulating the angiotensin II levels. We previously documented a high ACE D allele frequency in SSc patients and its role in increasing the risk of SSc, thus suggesting that the I/D polymorphism might be a useful genetic marker to identify SSc patients at risk to develop a severe vascular disease, frequently leading to gangrene. Moreover, our preliminary data, besides supporting the role of ACE I/D polymorphism as a predisposing factor to SSc, demonstrated its involvement in accelerated macrovascular disease by increasing the intima media thickness. Therefore, in SSc, not only endothelial dysfunction, but also vascular damage, linked to ACE I/D polymorphism, may significantly contribute to accelerated macrovascular disease, as the ACE D allele, by regulating both the production of angiotensin II and the degradation of bradykinin, contributes to mechanisms involved in the induction and maintenance of vessel wall modification.", 
    "1": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients have a 3-30-fold increased risk of death compared with the general population. This mortality difference is even more pronounced in younger subjects. Two markers of aortic stiffness--aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) and augmentation index (AIx)--have been prospectively related to all-cause and cardiovascular (CV) mortality in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) populations. The aims of our study were first, to confirm the important deleterious effect of arterial stiffness in uraemia and second, to assess the impact on survival of increased AIx in a relatively young non-diabetic dialysis population, with minimal CV disease.", 
    "2": "Ninety-two patients (mean age 42.6 +/- 11.2 years) were included in the study and followed for a period of 61 +/- 25 months. None of the patients had diabetes mellitus, and only 3.3% had prior history of CV disease. AIx was determined by applantation tonometry using a SphygmoCor device (AtCor, PWV Inc., Westmead, Sydney, Australia).", 
    "3": "Mean AIx in our study population was 19.9 +/- 13.7%; other significant haemodynamic parameters were: systolic blood pressure (SBP) 129 +/- 24 mmHg, pulse pressure 35.3 +/- 17.5 mmHg with 27.2% of the study population receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I). On univariate analysis, in our group AIx correlated with: body weight (P < 0.001), radial SBP (P < 0.001) and haemoglobin levels (P < 0.05). There was no correlation between AIx and any of the echocardiographic parameters. In the stepwise multiple regression analysis, the only independent predictors for AIx were weight (P < 0.001), SBP (P < 0.001) and haemoglobin (P < 0.05) with the model explaining 33% of the AIx variability (adjusted R(2) = 0.33). During the follow-up period, 15 deaths were recorded. In the Cox analysis (P = 0.014; chi square 20.7 for the model) the only independent predictors for all-cause mortality were age (P = 0.001), left ventricular mass index (P = 0.032) and ACE-I therapy (P = 0.039) while AIx did not reach statistical significance. There was no difference in patients' survival when divided by AIx tertiles, assessed by the log rank test (P = 0.78).",

    "5": "Cellulose propionate (CP) microparticles containing captopril (CAP) were prepared by solvent evaporation technique. The effects of polymer molecular weight, polymer composition and drug:polymer ratios on the particle size, flow properties, morphology, surface properties and release characteristics of the prepared captopril microparticles were examined. The anti-hypertensive effect of the selected CAP formulation in comparison with aqueous drug solution was also evaluated in vivo using hypertensive rats. The formulation containing drug:polymer blend ratio 1:1.5 (1:1 low:high molecular weight CP), namely F7, was chosen as the selected formulation with regard to the encapsulation efficiency (75.1%), flow properties (theta=24 degrees, Carr index=5%, Hausner ratio=1.1, packing rate=0.535) and release characteristics. Initial burst effect was observed in the release profile of all examined formulations. DSC and SEM results indicated that the initial burst effect could be attributed to dissolution of CAP crystals present on the surface or embedded in the superficial layer of the matrix. The release kinetics of CAP from most microparticle formulations followed diffusion mechanism. After oral administration of the selected microparticle formulation (F7) to hypertensive rats, systolic blood pressure decreased gradually over 24 h compared to reference drug solution. These results may suggest the potential application of cellulose propionate microparticles as a suitable sustained release drug delivery system for captopril.",

The effect can not be explained by dialysis adequacy since Kt/ V was similar throughout three treatment periods (1.18 +/- 0.24 vs. 1.25 +/- 0.21 vs. 1.25 +/- 0.14; p=ns). Systolic blood pressure was regulated even better with fosinopril than with enalapril (187.5 +/- 21.4 mmHg vs. 160.0 +/- 20.0 mmHg; p=0.01) and this effect was prolonged during period 3 (160.0 +/- 26.1mmHg). Hemoglobin values mainly depended on specific anemia therapy and not on particular ACEi drug.", 
    "14": "Fosinopril carries less risk of hyperkalemia in hypertensive hemodialysis patients than enalapril. Although definite conclusion may be drawn after well-designed studies, the results presented in this pilot study suggest that fosinopril may be recommended for hypertensive hemodialysis patients who are at risk to develop inter-dialytic hyperkalemia.", 
    "15": "Left ventricular hypertrophy refers to a pathologic increase in left ventricular mass and is associated with an increased risk of subsequent cardiovascular morbidity and mortality from any cause. In the development of left ventricular hypertrophy there is growth of cardiomyocytes and accumulation of extracellular matrix and fibrosis. The actions are partly induced by angiotensin II, the principal effector of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, binding to the AT1 receptor. Biochemical markers, some implicated in inflammatory changes, correlate with changes in left ventricular mass. The reduction in left ventricular mass brought about with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) therapy correlates with a reduction in these inflammatory changes, monitored by brain natriuretic peptide. Recent studies incorporating trials of ARBs have found ARBs to be more effective in reducing left ventricular mass than beta blockers and possibly more effective than calcium antagonists. Initial studies suggest that ARBs and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may have similar effects in terms of reducing left ventricular hypertrophy, and the combination of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and ARBs is thought to be synergistic due to a more complete inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. In conclusion, these agents are efficacious in antihypertensive therapy and can play an important role in the prevention or regression of left ventricular hypertrophy due to hypertension.", 
    "16": "Society is ageing. There has been a steady increase in the number of people aged 65 years and over throughout the 20th century and this trend is predicted to continue worldwide. This has resulted in an increase in the incidence of sarcopenia, which is a loss of muscle mass and function with age. Maintenance of muscular function into old age is critical to sustaining normal daily activity and functional independence. Sarcopenia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Till now most efforts to counteract sarcopenia have met with limited success. We postulate that targeting the renin-angiotensin system through angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition could play a role in countering sarcopenia. ACE inhibitors could work by preventing mitochondrial decline and improving endothelial function and muscle metabolism. We describe the literature to support our hypothesis that sarcopenia may be a potential therapeutic target for ACE inhibitors.", 
    "17": "Although recurrent diabetic nephropathy is common in patients with type I diabetes after kidney transplantation, the development of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FGS) is rare, and its development generally takes several years. We report here a case of type I diabetes mellitus with secondary FGS accompanied by proteinuria 10 months following kidney transplantation. Episode biopsy showed secondary FGS, evidenced by glomerular capillary collapse and large epithelial cells with ballooning degeneration. Exudative dense deposition of IgM in a diffuse global mesangial pattern and enlarged glomerular diameters were observed, suggestive of glomerular hyperfiltration which can lead to secondary FGS. An imbalance in body size between donor and recipient and/or uncontrolled diabetes are potential causes of glomerular hyperfiltration. We administered angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin II receptor blocker to reduce hyperfiltration-induced renal damage; the combination therapy reduced proteinuria from 2346 to 258 mg/d. Secondary FGS should be a consideration after kidney transplantation in patients with type I diabetes mellitus.", 
    "18": "A selection of lactoferricin B (LfcinB)-related peptides with an angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory effect have been examined using in vitro and ex vivo functional assays. Peptides that were analyzed included a set of sequence-related antimicrobial hexapeptides previously reported and two representative LfcinB-derived peptides. In vitro assays using hippuryl-L-histidyl-L-leucine (HHL) and angiotensin I as substrates allowed us to select two hexapeptides, PACEI32 (Ac-RKWHFW-NH2) and PACEI34 (Ac-RKWLFW-NH2), and also a LfcinB-derived peptide, LfcinB17-31 (Ac-FKCRRWQWRMKKLGA-NH2). Ex vivo functional assays using rabbit carotid arterial segments showed PACEI32 (both D- and L-enantiomers) and LfcinB17-31 have inhibitory effects on ACE-dependent angiotensin I-induced contraction. None of the peptides exhibited in vitro ACE inhibitory activity using bradykinin as the substrate. In conclusion, three bioactive lactoferricin-related peptides exhibit inhibitory effects on both ACE activity and ACE-dependent vasoconstriction with potential to modulate hypertension that deserves further investigation.",

In univariate analysis, increasing age, NYHA class, creatinine, and decreasing BMI, LVEF, and cholesterol, as well as lack of beta-blocker treatment and ischemic etiology (all p<0.002) related to higher mortality. In multivariable analysis, statin therapy related to lower mortality independently of all these variables (adjusted HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.47-0.93; p=0.017). In the second study CHF patients on statins had lower mortality (adjusted HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.44-0.77; p=0.0001).

The pathophysiology of heart failure is multi-factorial but recent studies suggest that aldosterone plays an important and independent role in its progression. Emerging evidence now suggests that aldosterone exerts renal-independent effects. It binds to its mineralocorticoid receptor to produce direct effects on the myocardium and vasculature, leading to damaging processes such as hypertrophy, necrosis, fibrosis and endothelial dysfunction, factors known to contribute to the pathophysiology of heart failure. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists have thus emerged as a new paradigm for the treatment of heart failure. The benefits of these agents on both morbidity and mortality when used in patients with chronic symptomatic heart failure have been demonstrated by recent trials.",

Normotensive Wistar rats were treated p.o. with CAP (75 mg/kg), ENA (20 mg/kg), PER (2 mg/kg) and QUIN (3 mg/kg) for 10 days. The influence of ACE-Is on coagulation and fibrinolytic systems as well as platelet function was evaluated. The hypotensive effect of ACE-Is was equal in all groups. QUIN maintained the final carotid blood flow at the highest value in comparison to PER and plasma ACE-Is. The arterial thrombus weight was reduced in PER and QUIN groups while venous thrombus weight was also reduced after CAP. Tissue and plasma ACE-Is caused the inhibition of platelet adhesion and aggregation. A reduction of fibrin generation, prolongation of prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and shortening of euglobulin clot lysis time (ECLT) were observed after PER and QUIN treatment. In conclusion, given in equipotent hypotensive doses, tissue ACE-Is exerted more pronounced antithrombotic effect than plasma ACE-Is in experimental thrombosis. The differences between tissue and plasma ACE-Is in terms of their more pronounced inhibition of experimental thrombosis may be related to the intensified activation of fibrinolysis and inhibition of coagulation.",

    "56": "In this cohort of insulin-treated Type 2 diabetic patients, the incidence of severe hypoglycaemia is higher than reported in most studies, corresponding to about one-third of that in Type 1 diabetes. Impaired hypoglycaemia awareness is the most important risk factor for severe hypoglycaemia.", 
    "57": "The cause of proteinuria in renal disease is the subject of intensive research and, latterly, the podocyte, a specialized epithelial cell of the kidney glomerulus, has been the focus of much of this endeavour. It is a complex cell with functions and structural features that have an important role in the development of proteinuria. This review explores some of the characteristics of the podocyte and how abnormalities of its structure and function may have particular relevance to the development and progression of clinical diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "58": "The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays a relevant role not only in the pathophysiology of essential hypertension, but also in the development of hypertensive target organ damage. Different drugs acting on RAAS components are now available: angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II AT1 receptors blockers (ARBs), non-selective and selective aldosterone antagonists. The review will focus on their effects on hypertensive organ damage. In fact, apart from the well known efficacy in reducing blood pressure, all these drugs have been demonstrated to protect against target organ damage, reversing or preventing its development. The main issues addressed will be: effects of the RAAS blockade on heart and kidney disease, protective action against arterial wall damage, with a focus on the endothelial protection. The comparison among ACE inhibitors, ARBs and aldosterone antagonists will be discussed, with specific reference to different class and/or drug effects and to the results of few studies evaluating the effects of combination therapy with different drugs blocking the RAAS.", 
    "59": "Evidence indicates that oxidative stress refers to a condition where cells are subjected to excessive levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Overall vascular function is dependent upon a fine balance between oxidant and antioxidant mechanisms which is required, at least in part, for proper functioning of the endothelium. Considerable experimental and clinical data indicate that the intracellular oxidant milieu is also involved in several redox-sensitive cellular signaling pathways, such as ion transport systems, protein phosphorylation, and gene expression and thus also plays important roles as modulator of vascular cell function, such as cell growth, apoptosis, migration, angiogenesis and cell adhesion. Overproduction of ROS under pathophysiologic conditions is integral in the development of vascular disease. This fact stimulated an intensive search of new pharmacological approaches to improve vascular hemeostasis and, particularly those intended to decrease oxidative stress or augment the antioxidant defense mechanisms.", 
    "60": "Cardiovascular diseases are the major cause of death and a significant cause of disability in the Western world and more recently threaten to pose an increasing health burden on developing nations. People with pre-existent vascular disease are those at highest risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes and require aggressive secondary preventive therapies. Large strides have been made in the development of pharmacologic agents that intervene on various pathways implicated in atherogenesis, thus offering the ability to greatly impact on disease progression and to prevent events. Compelling data derived primarily from randomized controlled trials have shown the benefits of aspirin (or antiplatelet agents) and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (A), beta-blockers and blood pressure (B) and cholesterol-lowering drugs (C), particularly statins, in preventing recurrent events and improving survival. Taken together these data are the foundation for the simple, but important advice for secondary prevention - the ABCs. In addition, the evidence for the central role of lifestyle factors as determinants of risk has lead to increased efforts towards developing interventions aimed at modifying lifestyle patterns. Today, the biggest challenge remains in the implementation of proven effective therapies. Our focus should turn to educating physicians and patients alike regarding available therapies and their indications. In addition systematic, sustainable and globally applicable approaches to the secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases need to be developed to truly realize the vast potential benefits of existing therapies.", 
    "61": "It is known that the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a fundamental role not only as a vasoconstrictor in controlling blood pressure and electrolyte/fluid homeostasis, but also as a mitogenic factor through the Ang-II type-1 (AT1) receptor in smooth muscle cells and cardiac myocytes. Angiotensin II (Ang-II) is indeed thought to be a growth factor, and Ang-II receptor blockers (ARBs), a class of antihypertensive agent, suppress signal transduction pathways mediated by several growth factors or cytokines, through the AT1 receptor. There is increasing evidence that the RAS is implicated in the development of various cancers. We previously demonstrated that ARBs have the potential to inhibit the growth of prostate cancer cells and tumors through the AT1 receptor. This review highlights the possibility of ARBs as novel agents for prostate cancer as well as other cancers, and reviews the literature on this area.",

    "63": "Sixty-seven patients with IgAN were randomly divided into the control group and the astragalus group, both received dipyridamole and benazepril orally, while the astragalus group treated with AI by intravenous dripping additionally. The indices for renal tubular function, including protein in blood and urine, urinary retinol binding protein (RBP) and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (UNAG), were detected. Area of glomerular Bowman capsule, renal tubules, and capillary were measured with color magic image analysis system type CMIAS2000.", 
    "64": "Urinary RBP and UNAG were correlated with tubulointerstitial lesion. Urine protein concentration decreased, blood albumin increased remarkably and renal tubular function improved after treatment in the astragalus group, with the improvement significantly different to those in the control group respectively.",

    "68": "On average, 71% of patients received antiplatelet agents, 56% beta-blockers, 59% statins, and 36% ACE inhibitors. Only 32% received the combination of antiplatelet agents, statins, and beta-blockers, and only 14% all four classes. Practice guidelines were followed more closely in patients diagnosed most recently. Patients receiving all four classes of secondary prevention medication more often has a history of myocardial infarction or were younger. Average doses were consistent with recommendations for beta-blockers, but appeared too low for ACE inhibitors and statins (except for atorvastatin).", 
    "69": "Medical management of patients with chronic coronary artery disease in France, while still suboptimal, is improving. Our findings, which are concordant with previous registry data, emphasize the underuse of recognized secondary prevention medications in very elderly patients and the importance of the initial prescription at diagnosis.",

The aim of this study was to detect whether early ACE inhibitor administration slows recovery from anemia following recent cardiac surgery.", 
    "71": "Forty male patients with anemia (hemoglobin < 12 g/dL) an average of 9 days after cardiac surgery were randomized to receive enalapril (ACE inhibitor group) or not. All of the patients received ferrous sulfate, 525 mg, in addition to standard therapy. Patients with anemia due to other causes were excluded. Blood samples were obtained at baseline, and after 8 days, 16 days, and 60 days. A 6-min walking test and echocardioscan were performed at baseline, and after 16 days and 60 days of treatment, and a chest radiograph was obtained at baseline and after 60 days. The ACE inhibitor group showed a statistically significant lower increase in hemoglobin and RBC values. The peak between-group differences of 1 g/dL of hemoglobin (p = 0.012) and 444 RBCs per milliliter (p = 0.017) were observed on day 16.",

    "73": "The choice is difficult in medicine. But individual physicians and patients must make medical decisions rather than organizations or pharmaceutical companies. The choice concerns the transparency of the decision-making process (evidence based medicine), and mistrust of the methods used in cost-effectiveness analysis. Medicare's policy of paying for any medical advance that has positive benefits, regardless of its costs, is un-sustainable. Cost-effectiveness information may assume a more important role in future coverage decisions with regard to outpatient prescription drugs, but at the private level, rather than at the national one. Functional equivalence of drugs reflects a reference-pricing technique applied to a therapeutic category--reimbursement for compounds of similar efficacy within a therapeutic class set to the lowest-priced product in the class. Essentially, a standard of functional equivalence applies a cost-effectiveness principle: assuming that alternative interventions are equivalent, one should not pay more for one of them.", 
    "74": "High glucose and angiotensin II (Ang II) can activate protein kinase C (PKC) in diabetes mellitus. However, it is not clear which isoform of PKC is activated by glucose or Ang II. Our study focused on the effects of angiotensin blockade, using the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor fosinopril, the Ang II receptor blocker irbesartan and their combination, on the expression and translocation of PKC isoforms alpha and betaII in the renal cortex and medulla in diabetes.", 
    "75": "Hyperglycemia was induced with streptozotocin and diabetic rats were randomized to 4 groups: diabetic control, irbesartan group (40 mg/kg daily), fosinopril group (40 mg/kg daily) and combination group (irbesartan plus fosinopril, 20 mg/kg daily, respectively); age-matched normal rats served as normal control. After 4 weeks, expression and translocation of PKC-alpha and -betaII in the renal cortex and medulla were assessed by immunohistochemistry and Western immunoblotting.", 
    "76": "The expression of PKC-alpha in the membrane and cytosol fractions from the renal cortex was significantly higher in diabetic rats (276.83 +/- 32.44% in membrane, 149.04 +/- 23.42% in cytosol) than that in normal ones. The expression of PKC-betaII in the renal cortex of diabetic rats decreased significantly in the membrane (50.00 +/- 11.68%, p < 0.05) and remained unchanged in the cytosol (94.51 +/- 11.69%, p > 0.05) compared with normal controls. Treatment with irbesartan, fosinopril and their combination partially corrected the abnormalities mentioned above. For the expression of PKC-alpha and -betaII in the medulla, no difference was detected among the 5 groups.",

Alacepril, CV-11974, and spironolactone significantly reduced the enhanced production of MCP-1 and TNF-alpha induced by exogenous Ang II. Specifically, 10 muM of spironolactone significantly reduced cytokine production, compared to the same dose of alacepril or CV-11974. These findings indicate that spironolactone may contribute to ameliorate the prognosis of patients with cardiovascular diseases by reducing Ang II-induced inflammation, although further exploration including determining the mechanisms would be required.",

    "82": "All groups understood that medication was important and had developed methods (dosette boxes, alarm clocks) to cope. Three levels of awareness were identified. People at Level 1 did not know the purpose or possible side effects of their medication; those at Level 2 knew the names and main side effects and relied on doctors to provide detailed information. People at Level 3 understood their diagnosis and were committed to finding out about their illness.", 
    "83": "Knowledge is not the only barrier to informed discussions of heart failure. Although everyone we interviewed knew that they should adhere to their medication regimes, only patients at Level 3 were equipped to discuss their treatment in detail. Patients need to be familiar with symptoms of heart failure, the purpose and side effects of their drugs. Medication reviews and specialist heart failure nurses offer opportunities to improve patients' understanding.", 
    "84": "Water soluble cranberry-based phytochemical combinations with oregano, rosemary, and Rhodiola rosea were evaluated for total phenolic content, related antioxidant activity and inhibition of diabetes management-related alpha -glucosidase, pancreatic alpha-amylase inhibition, and hypertension-related ACE-I inhibitory activities. Water extracts of oregano had 114.9 mg/g DW of phenolics which was highest among all the extracts tested, whereas the 75% cranberry with 25% oregano combinations had the highest phenolics (38.9 mg/g DW) among all the combinations tested. The water extracts of oregano had the highest DPPH radical inhibition activity (73.6 %), whereas among combinations the 75% cranberry and 25% oregano had the highest DPPH radical inhibition activity (50.8 %). These results indicated a correlation between total phenolic content and antioxidant activity. The water extracts of pure Rhodiola rosea had the highest alpha -glucosidase inhibition, whereas the 75% cranberry and 25% Rhodiola rosea combination had the highest inhibition among the combinations. In the case of alpha -amylase inhibition the water extracts of Rhodiola rosea had the highest inhibition, whereas the 75% cranberry with 25% Rhodiola rosea combination had the highest inhibition among the combinations. All the water extracts tested indicated that they had anti-ACE-I inhibitory activity. More specifically, among the water extracts 100% cranberry had the highest ACE-I inhibitory activity and among the combination the 75% cranberry with 25% rosemary had the highest ACE-I inhibitory activity. The analysis of alpha -glucosidase,alpha -amylase, and ACE-I inhibitory activities suggested that inhibition depend on the phenolic profile of each unique extract and by bringing together synergistic combinations to cranberry, health beneficial functionality was enhanced. This enhanced functionality in terms of high alpha -glucosidase and alpha -amylase inhibitory activities indicate the potential for diabetes management, and high ACE-I inhibitory activity indicates the potential for hypertension management.", 
    "85": "In the current study, we investigated 2 species of the genus Rhodiola for the inhibition of alpha-amylase,alpha-glucosidase and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity. Water extracts of Rhodiola crenulata had the highest alpha-amylase inhibitory activity (IC50,98.1 microg total phenolic /ml) followed by ethanol extract of R.crenulata (IC50, 120.9 microg total phenolic/ml) and ethanol extract of R.rosea (IC50, 173.4 microg total phenolic /ml). Ethanol R.rosea (IC50, 44.7 microg total phenolic/ml), water extract of R.rosea (IC50, 52.3 microg total phenolic/ml), water extract of R.crenulata (IC50, 60.3 microg total phenolic /ml) and ethanol extract of R.crenulata (IC50, 60.2 microg total phenolic/ml) also showed significant alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity. The alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity of the extracts was compared to standard tyrosol, which was significantly detected in the extracts using HPLC. Tyrosol had strong alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity (IC50, 70.8 microg total phenolic/ml) but did not have any inhibitory effect on the alpha-amylase activity. Results suggested that alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activities of both Rhodiola extracts correlated to the phenolic content, antioxidant activity and phenolic profile of the extracts. The ability of the above Rhodiola extracts to inhibit rabbit lung angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) was investigated. The ethanol extracts of R.rosea had the highest ACE inhibitory activity (38.5 %) followed by water extract of R.rosea (36.2 %) and R.crenulata (15.4 %).", 
    "86": "The discovery of a new angiotensin II (Ang II) pathway generated by mast cell chymase has highlighted new biological functions for Ang II that is not related to the classic renin-angiotensin system (RAS). The conversion of Ang I to II occurs not only via the plasma angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) or tissue ACE but also via chymase produced in the mast cells of humans, monkeys, dogs, and hamsters. The conversion by chymase has been especially found in morbid tissues following the migration of mast cells. The newly discovered functions of chymase are discussed in this review. During the vascular narrowing that occurs after vein grafting or balloon injury in dogs, chymase activity and Ang II concentrations along with intimal proliferation are significantly increased and chymase inhibitors completely suppressed these increase, though ACE inhibitors are ineffective. Similar results have also been confirmed in the dog arteriovenous fistula stenosis model. In both human and animal aneurysmal aortas, chymase activity is significantly increased, and chymase inhibitor has been shown to prevent the development of aneurysms in dogs. Chymase is activated in diseased hearts, and chymase inhibitors reduce both the mortality rates after acute myocardial infarction and the cardiac fibrosis that leads to the development of cardiomyopathy in hamsters. Chymase is also a pro-angiogenic factor, since the injection of chymase strongly facilitates angiogenesis in hamsters. We propose that chymase inhibitors are effective in the prevention of multiple cardiovascular disorders, especially at the local event level without any effect on the systemic blood pressure.", 
    "87": "Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality in patients with renal failure, accounting for more than 50% of deaths in end-stage renal disease. Risk factor modification with the use of cardioprotective medications such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), beta-adrenergic antagonists (beta-blockers), acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) has been shown to reduce mortality in the general population.", 
    "88": "To determine the extent of use of these medications in a hemodialysis population.", 
    "89": "This was a cross-sectional study of a cohort of 185 prevalent hemodialysis patients. The inclusion criterion was dialysis dependence and there were no exclusion criteria. Data collection was by chart review. Contraindications to individual medication classes were not obtained.", 
    "90": "There were 185 patients enrolled, the mean age was 63.42+/-15.1 years and 126 (68.1%) were male. Sixty-six (35.7%) patients had diabetes and 89 (48.1%) patients had established coronary artery disease (CAD). Forty-six (24.9%) patients were on ACEIs or angiotensin II receptor blockers, 59 (31.9%) were on beta-blockers, 70 (37.8%) were on ASA and 84 (45.4%) were on statins. Although these medications were used in fewer than 60% of patients, those with CAD were more likely to be prescribed an ACEI or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (P=0.026), a beta-blocker (P<0.001), ASA (P<0.001) or a statin (P=0.001) than those without CAD. There were no differences in the use of these medications between diabetic and nondiabetic patients.",

    "92": "Hypertension is prevalent in over 25% of populations in developed countries, and poses an increasing economic burden on health resources. Therefore it is predicted that future medical treatment of hypertension will be increasingly affected by cost considerations. Several classes of antihypertensive drugs are used as first-line agents for the treatment of hypertension, but the economic impact of using these agents in different countries remains to be addressed. In this study, we compared health costs associated with treatment of hypertension using the calcium channel blocker amlodipine and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril in the US and Japan. Pharmaceutical costs and hospitalization costs were analyzed from established databases. The data for the prevalence of myocardial infarction and stroke were derived from the Framingham study and the Hisayama study. Analysis of the economic impacts using relative risk differences between the calcium channel blocker and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor together with regional hospitalization costs resulted in an apparent 11.2 billion yen health cost reduction in favor of the calcium channel blocker in the case of Japan, in contrast to an apparent 5.7 billion yen reduction in favor of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor in the case of the US. The trends in Japan for 2000 and 2004 were similar. These results suggest that there are regional differences in the health costs associated with different classes of hypertensive agents, which could affect national policies on the choice of antihypertensive drugs. It is predicted that future treatment of hypertension will be increasingly tailored to the epidemiologic profiles and medical costs of individual communities.", 
    "93": "Individual markers of inflammation may add incremental predictive value in the context of conventionally available risk factors. We evaluated the ability of 9 inflammatory biomarkers, microalbuminuria, and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (Nt-proBNP) to improve cardiovascular risk prediction beyond that obtained from traditional risk factors in a secondary-prevention population.", 
    "94": "We measured biomarkers representing the acute-phase reaction (C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, and interleukin-6), proinflammatory pathways (soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 and -2, soluble interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, and interleukin-18), endothelial activation (soluble vascular adhesion molecule-1 and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1), Nt-proBNP, and microalbuminuria in 3199 study individuals of the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) Study and assessed their association with risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death (primary outcome, n=501) over 4.5 years of follow-up. In a backward Cox regression procedure that included risk factors and biomarkers, Nt-proBNP (hazard ratio [HR] 1.72 per increment SD, 95% CI 1.39 to 2.12; P<0.0001), soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (HR 1.46, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.80; P=0.0003), microalbuminuria (HR 1.55, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.98; P=0.0004), soluble interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (HR 1.30, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.61; P=0.02), and fibrinogen (HR 1.31, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.62; P=0.02) remained significantly related to the primary outcome. Only inclusion of Nt-proBNP provided incremental information above that obtained by models of traditional risk factors.",

A model consisting of simple traditional risk factors and Nt-proBNP provided the best clinical prediction in the secondary-prevention population.", 
    "96": "The objective of this study was to identify clinical predictors of response to initial mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) therapy for membranous lupus nephritis (MLN). We observed the clinical outcomes of patients in the Hopkins Lupus Cohort within the first year of initiation of treatment with MMF therapy for newly diagnosed MLN, classified according to the new International Society of Nephrology/Renal Pathology Society (ISN/RPS) 2003 classification. Complete renal remission was defined as proteinuria less than 500 mg/24 hours. Demographic, clinical, treatment and laboratory data were examined for their association with renal remission. Twenty-nine MLN patients treated with MMF were identified. Eleven (38%) patients achieved complete renal remission by 12 months. Of those taking hydroxychloroquine, 7/11 (64%) were in remission within 12 months compared to only 4/18 (22%) of those not on hyroxychloroquine (P = 0.036 based on a log-rank test). This association persisted after controlling for the presence of anti-ds-DNA (P = 0.026). Our results provide evidence that hydroxychloroquine has a benefit for renal remission when MMF is used as the initial therapy for MLN. Although hydroxychloroquine is frequently stopped in patients with lupus nephritis, this study suggests it should be started or maintained.", 
    "97": "Although multiple studies suggest a potential role for angiotensin II in inflammation, most were performed either in vitro or in animals with non-immune-complex-mediated diseases. Extrapolation of these findings to humans, particularly patients with lupus, which involves multiple immunoregulatory pathways, is unclear. In autoimmune-prone MRL/lpr mice, angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibition improved survival although to a lesser degree than cyclophosphamide and diminished the glomerular histopathologic damage, proteinuria, lymphoid hyperplasia, dermatitis, and hypergammaglobulinemia, with a reduction in TGF-beta1 and beta 2 expression in the kidneys and renal chemokine mRNA expression. Spleen levels of IL-4 and IL-10 were also reduced. Uncontrolled studies in patients with treatment-refractory lupus nephritis showed a significant reduction in proteinuria with ACE-inhibitors and Angiotensin receptor blockers treatment. The 'masking' effect of ACE-inhibitors should be taken into consideration, as an exacerbation of lupus nephritis may be missed when estimated by the magnitude of proteinuria, which is decreased by these treatments. No single ACE genotype was consistently associated with subsets of SLE patients. In retrospective analyses, ACE-inhibitor use predicted a favourable outcome in 94 cases of pauci-immune vasculitis. The attenuating effect of angiotensin II inhibitors on the progression of chronic renal disease is well recognized. The data on the role of this intervention in lupus is limited.", 
    "98": "Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptide was isolated from the bovine lactoferrin hydrolysate using peptic hydrolysis by 2-step of reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. This peptide was identified as Leu-Arg-Pro-Val-Ala-Ala and it produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of ACE activity in vitro with an IC50 value of about 4.14 microM. Also, this inhibition was identified as noncompetitive from the Lineweaver-Burk plot. Moreover, the antihypertensive activity of Leu-Arg-Pro-Val-Ala-Ala was investigated by the intravenous injection into spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). A dose-dependent reduction of systolic blood pressure by this peptide was observed at 60 min after injection and it maximally decreased the blood pressure at a rate of 1 nmol/ml/kg. The blood pressure lowering activity of this peptide was calculated as 210% of captopril (10 pmol/ml/kg) that was used as positive control. Otherwise, identification of this peptide in the blood of SHRs was carried out chromatographically. Reduction of blood pressure coincides with the peak peptide concentration in the serum. Thus, we conclude that this peptide inhibits ACE activity in vitro and lowers systolic blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rat.", 
    "99": "Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors (ACEIs) like enalapril are extremely effective in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure. One of the most important side-effects of these drugs which can lead to cessation of therapy is a persistant dry cough, induced because of increased bradykinin levels in the lung. Although antitussive alkaloids like codeine are effective in suppressing this cough, they too present a wide range of side-effects, most notably addiction.", 
    "100": "In a previous work we were able to show that noscapine, a non-narcotic antitussive agent, was able to decrease enalapril induced cough in guinea pigs. In this work, papaverine, another non-narcotic alkaloid found in opium latex was tested in the guinea pig model for antitussive activity.",

    "107": "Diabetes was associated with a considerable increase in AER. Both enalapril and MMF retarded the increase in albuminuria, which was nearly completely abrogated by combination therapy. Increased glomerular volume and tubulointerstitial injury index in diabetic rats was attenuated by treatment with either enalapril or MMF and further reduced by the combination of the two. Elevated malondialdehyde levels in renal tissue were reduced by enalapril or MMF and, more effectively, by combined enalapril with MMF. Renal overexpression of ICAM-1 was not retarded by enalapril and attenuated by MMF or combined enalapril with MMF. Combination therapy was associated with a superior suppression of diabetes-induced macrophage recruitment and overexpression of MCP-1 and TGFbeta1 compared to either monotherapy in renal tissue.",

    "109": "Endothelial cells play a vital role in the success or failure of a transplant procedure. The procedure itself can be viewed as a series of insults that damages the endothelium thereby triggering an inflammatory cascade that may, if uncontrolled, drive the proliferative and fibrotic processes characteristic of chronic graft vasculopathy. Unfortunately, many immunosuppressant agents contribute to this process. Glucocorticoids and the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporine induce endothelial dysfunction, and although tacrolimus may not have the same disruptive effects on endothelial function as cyclosporine, its endothelial activity is still being established. In contrast, antiproliferative agents slow the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells and so help protect against graft vasculopathy. Researchers agree that endothelial cell dysfunction is a potentially treatable stage in the multifactorial process of graft vasculopathy and rejection. A number of cardiovascular agents (statins, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers), immunoregulatory drugs, and dietary compounds have been shown to have beneficial effects on endothelial function. We briefly review the evidence supporting their use as protection for endothelial cells in transplant recipients.",

Twenty-six hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes at the baseline were administered 5 mg of enalapril once daily for 12 weeks. At the beginning of the study, the subjects were assigned to receive an add-on of 50 mg of losartan once daily or 5 mg of enalapril once daily for another 12 weeks. Blood samples were collected at the baseline, at the beginning, and at the end of the study for the measurement of laboratory parameters, and these data, including blood pressure, were compared between the two groups. Treatment with 5 mg of enalapril significantly decreased the systolic blood pressure level in both groups, and the addition of losartan and/or enalapril further decreased the levels. There was no difference in blood pressure between the two groups. However, the addition of losartan, but not enalapril, significantly decreased the urinary protein excretion level, plasma aldosterone, and hypersensitive-C-reactive protein at the end of the study. The results established that the dual blockade of angiotensin II with enalapril and losartan has a greater clinical benefit for high-risk patients with hypertension and advanced diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "111": "The expanding clinical indications for the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors during the past three decades to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality across a broad spectrum of cardiovascular diseases have been the consequence of impressively productive interchanges between basic science and clinical medicine. In some areas, the initial discovery from animal investigations produced the hypotheses that were confirmed and expanded in patients with specific disease processes. In the development of ACE inhibitors, there are also important examples where an unexpected discovery from clinical trials spurred a host of laboratory investigations that uncovered novel mechanisms to underpin the clinical observations. Although developed as an antihypertensive agent, these effective interchanges, termed \"translational research,\" have collectively produced convincing data to demonstrate that ACE inhibitors can and should be used to slow progression of renal disease, prevent and treat heart failure, attenuate adverse left ventricular remodeling after myocardial infarction and improve prognosis, reduce atherosclerotic complications in patients with coronary artery disease, and, even more recently, reduce the incidence of Type II diabetes.",

Newer data show that patients with CSX with endothelial dysfunction have an increased risk for future adverse cardiac events. Current hypotheses of CSX pathophysiology emphasize a dysfunctional vascular endothelium that leads to microvascular ischemia. Treatments that target improving endothelial function, such as statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, estrogen, and lifestyle modification, are promising additions to treatment regimens for CSX. The goal of this article is to provide information for improved diagnosis, risk stratification, and therapy for the population with CSX.",

Given the associated co-morbidities of obesity, hypertension and cardiovascular disease, the rising incidence of diabetes has important health consequences and efforts to reduce this incidence are critical. Although lifestyle modifications, including weight loss and exercise, are instrumental in the prevention of diabetes, pharmacological therapies that reduce the incidence of diabetes have the significant potential to lower risk. The results of several large clinical trials have demonstrated that treatment with ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists (angiotensin receptor blockers; ARBs) may prevent or delay the onset of diabetes. These trials have demonstrated an approximately 15-30% reduction in the new onset of diabetes in those receiving ACE inhibitors and ARBs when compared with placebo or other active therapy. Although the exact mechanism underlying the effects are not entirely clear, multiple animal and human studies have demonstrated that the renin-angiotensin system plays an important role in glucose homeostasis. Although future prospective studies to clarify the role of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in preventing diabetes are ongoing, there is substantial existing evidence from completed trials that these agents may prevent the onset of diabetes.",

Serial measurements of cardiac enzymes were also elevated. Acute coronary syndrome was suspected. A cardiac ultrasound revealed left ventricular dilation with akinesia and systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction, 40%). Emergency catheterization revealed normal coronary arteries, suggesting a probable diagnosis of acute myocarditis. From the fourth day, the patient was progressing favorably.

Left atrial diameter was measured with transthoracic echocardiogram at baseline and 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after randomization. The primary endpoint was the incidence of AF documented by 12-lead ECG or Holter after 14 days and within 24 months after randomization. The primary endpoint was reached in 24 patients (41%) in group 1, 11 (19%) in group 2, and 14 (24%) in group 3 (P = 0.02). The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in AF recurrence in group 2 (P = 0.006, log-rank test) as well as in group 3 (P = 0.04, log-rank test) when compared with group 1. No difference in the AF recurrence-free survival was found between group 2 and group 3.

    "132": "Excess body weight may be associated with various functional/structural lesions of the kidney. The spectrum ranges from glomerulomegaly with or without focal or segmental glomerulosclerosis, to diabetic nephropathy, to carcinoma of the kidney and nephrolithiasis. The first sign of renal injury is microalbuminuria or frank proteinuria, in particular in the presence of hypertension. The occurrence of microalbuminuria and/or chronic kidney insufficiency (glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2) is related to the increasing number of components of the metabolic syndrome, ie, central obesity, elevated fasting blood glucose level, hypertriglycerides, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and hypertension. In the long run, end-stage renal failure may develop. An increased body mass index is particularly harmful in patients with reduced renal functional mass (unilateral renal agenesis or nephrectomy) and other renal diseases (immunoglobulin A nephritis and chronic graft dysfunction after kidney transplantation). In the pathogenesis of obesity-associated glomerulopathy, hyperfiltration is of fundamental importance. The factors involved are energy intake (high protein and salt), hyperinsulinemia, and enhanced tubuloglomerular feedback because of increased sodium reabsorption. The adrenergic and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone systems as well as glucocorticoids are stimulated. In addition, several active proteins generated in the central adipose tissue, such as leptin, proinflammatory cytokines, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, angiotensinogen, and growth factors (transforming growth factor-beta1), as well as low levels of the protective adiponectin, may contribute to renal injury. Of greatest importance is the development of hypertension and of diabetes, which are directly related to the severity of central obesity. Obesity-associated renal disease should be prevented or retarded by weight reduction following lifestyle modification (salt restriction, hypocaloric diet, aerobic exercise), or eventually by antiobesity medication or bariatric surgery. In the presence of glomerulopathy and/or hypertension, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II type I receptor blockers are the drugs of choice to improve glomerular hyperfiltration.", 
    "133": "An increased extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover has been associated with poor survival in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) due to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). However, the influence of the accelerated collagen turnover on the progressive large artery stiffening process characterizing CHF has not been clarified. This is relevant because aortic stiffening imposes an additional systolic load and impairs exercise tolerance in CHF patients. Therefore, we investigated whether the serum aminoterminal propeptide of type III collagen (PIIINP), an established marker of ECM turnover and tissue fibrosis in DCM, was associated with aortic stiffness in DCM patients.", 
    "134": "A total of 89 patients with clinical diagnosis of DCM (age 62 +/- 9 years, 80% men, mean ejection fraction 34% +/- 8%) were selected. Aortic pulse-wave velocity (PWV), a well-established marker of aortic stiffness, was measured by Doppler ultrasonography. Serum concentration of PIIINP was determined by radioimmunoassay. Mean aortic PWV was 5.7 +/- 2.3 m/s, and PIIINP was 5.0 +/- 1.3 microg/L. The variables correlated with aortic PWV were age (r = 0.33, P = .002), PIIINP (r = 0.30, P = .005), heart rate (r = 0.27, P = .02), stroke volume (r = -0.24, P = .03) and New York Heart Association class (r = 0.25, P = .02). In a multivariate analysis, age (P = .02) and PIIINP (P = .01) were independently related with aortic PWV, accounting for 27% of its variance.",

    "136": "The effects of an angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor blocker (ARB) on ischemic brain damage induced by middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion were compared with those of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Treatment of male C57BL/6J mice with an ARB, candesartan, reduced the brain ischemic area and neurological deficit after MCA occlusion at a non-hypotensive dose. In contrast, an ACE inhibitor, enalapril, did not reduce the brain ischemic area, and neurological deficit even at a hypotensive dose. Candesartan improved the reduction of brain surface blood flow after MCA occlusion, and inhibited the increase in superoxide production both in the cortex and brain arterial wall at non-hypotensive and hypotensive doses. However, enalapril did not affect the changes in blood flow and superoxide production in the brain after MCA occlusion. AT2 receptor expression in the ischemic area was increased at 3 h after MCA occlusion by pretreatment with candesartan, but not that with enalapril. AT1 receptor expression was neither affected by candesartan nor by enalapril. These results suggest that candesartan attenuated ischemic brain damage, at least partly, through inhibition of oxidative stress.", 
    "137": "The prevalence of primary hyperaldosteronism is 5-10% of all hypertensive patients, and clearly above the estimated prevalence in the past. In nearly 30% of patients with therapy resistant hypertension, primary hyperaldosteronism is detected if they are investigated thoroughly. This will result in 1.5 to 2.5 million people in Germany suffering from primary hyperaldosteronism. Besides efficient diagnostic procedures, an effective treatment is of increasing importance. The aldosterone-producing adenoma (Conn's syndrome) is primarily cured by operation, in most cases performed endoscopically. Bilateral hyperplasia, which is found in two-thirds of primary hyperaldosteronism, is treated primarily by mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist: 12.5-50 mg/day spironolactone (in case of anti-androgenic side-effects alternatively by 50-100 mg/day eplerenone). If the blood pressure can not be lowered by this first-line treatment, an additional treatment with potassium-sparing diuretics, calcium-antagonists, ACE-inhibitors or angiotensin-2-antagonists is necessary. The start of medication should be closely monitored by serum electrolyte and creatinine controls.",

In a subgroup of dogs with concurrent furosemide treatment (pimobendan [n=31], benazepril [n=25]), the Heart Insufficiency Score improved in favor of pimobendan (P=0.0011), equating to a superior overall efficacy rating (P<0.0001) at day 56. Long-term median survival (i.e., death or treatment failure) for dogs receiving pimobendan was 415 days versus 128 days for dogs not on pimobendan (P=0.0022).", 
    "139": "To study if the endogenous renin-angiotensin system affects diabetic retinal leukostasis, rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes were treated with an ACE inhibitor (ramipril), an angiotensin II AT(1) receptor antagonist (losartan) and the Ca channel blocker, (nifedipine). In the diabetic rats, these drug treatments reduced systolic blood pressure by approximately 16 mmHg but did not change blood glucose. After 2 weeks, the rats were examined for retinal leukostasis in vivo with a scanning laser ophthalmoscope (SLO). Retinal leukostasis, which was defined as no movement of arrested leukocytes over 2 min, was markedly higher in diabetic rats than normal controls (P<0.01). Leukostasis was significantly decreased by ramipril and losartan (P<0.01 vs. untreated diabetic rats) but was still higher than normal. Retinal leukostasis after nifedipine treatment was not significantly different than in untreated diabetic rats. The same trend was observed when leukostasis was analyzed on retinal flat mounts with concanavalin A and CD45 immunofluorescence; ramipril and losartan treatment, however, decreased leukostasis to values no different than controls. Retinal leukostasis was lowered by nifedipine (P<0.05, untreated diabetes vs. nifedipine-treated) but was still higher than in normal, ramipril-, or losartan-treated rats. Assays of gene expression of retinal intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1) by semi-quantitative RT-PCR indicated that ICAM-1 mRNA was increased in diabetic rats but was decreased markedly by treatment with losartan or ramipril, and modestly by nifedipine. In summary, suppressing the activity of the endogenous renin-angiotensin system markedly decreases, perhaps even normalizes, the retinal leukostasis that accompanies type I diabetes in rats. These effects seem to be partly independent of blood pressure and to be associated with a decrease in ICAM-1 gene expression. Angiotensin II may, thus, mediate retinal leukostasis in early diabetes.",

Unfortunately, most randomized clinical trials have enrolled few older persons, and, as a result, few data are available to guide clinical practice. As in younger patients, aspirin, beta-blockers, nitrates, clopidogrel, heparin, statins, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are useful, beginning with lower doses and carefully observing the patient for symptoms of toxicity. Similarly, older patients should not be denied the benefit of reperfusion therapy and early invasive strategy because of their age. Although primary angioplasty is an optimal reperfusion strategy, thrombolytic therapy is a beneficial alternative in carefully selected older patients. Although glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors appear to be beneficial in select cases, bleeding concerns exist. Despite a growing body of evidence in support of aggressive ACS care in older persons, evidence-based therapy is underused in older patients. Continued efforts are required to improve the quality of care to this high-risk cohort of ACS patients.",

Percutaneous procedures have previously been limited in their efficacy by restenosis and resulting morbidity, but contemporary stenting procedures appear to show equivalent mortality and morbidity outcomes (to bypass surgery) at 5 years. Drug-eluting stents are the newest percutaneous technique and show significant reduction in restenosis compared with older catheter-based therapies, but further investigation is needed to definitively define the role of drug-eluting stents in the treatment of multivessel CAD.

From these, 190 patients had diabetes (medical, 75 patients; angioplasty, 56 patients; surgery, 59 patients) and comprised the present study population. Mortality rates were analyzed for the entire 5 years of follow-up. Separate analyzes were also performed for mortality at 2 time intervals: during the first year and after the first year of follow-up. We calculated the probability of death conditional on surviving to the start of the interval analyzed. The cumulative 5-year mortality as well as the mortality during the first year of follow-up was not significantly different among treatment groups, both for diabetic and for nondiabetic subjects. Also, during years 2 to 5, the mortality of the 3 treatment groups was not different for nondiabetic subjects. Among diabetic subjects, however, patients randomized to angioplasty or surgery had a significantly lower mortality between years 2 and 5 than those allocated to medical treatment (P=0.039).", 
    "161": "Surgery, angioplasty, and medical treatment appear to be associated with similar mortality rates for non-diabetic subjects. For diabetic subjects, however, coronary revascularization (percutaneous or surgical) significantly decreased the risk of death after the first year and up to 5 years, compared with medical treatment alone.", 
    "162": "Omapatrilat, a vasopeptidase inhibitor, inhibits both neutral endopeptidase and angiotensin-converting enzyme with similar potency. The aim of this study was to investigate whether omapatrilat prevents or reverses cardiovascular remodeling and hypertension in deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt rats. Male Wistar rats (313 +/- 2 g, n = 114) were uninephrectomized (UNX) with or without further treatment with DOCA and 1% NaCl in the drinking water. Compared with UNX control rats, DOCA-salt rats developed hypertension, cardiovascular hypertrophy, perivascular and interstitial cardiac fibrosis and inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and the prolongation of ventricular action potential duration within four weeks. The administration of omapatrilat (40 mg/kg/day po) for two weeks commencing two weeks after surgery attenuated the development of cardiovascular hypertrophy, inflammation, fibrosis, and ventricular action potential prolongation. In contrast, omapatrilat treatment did not lower systolic blood pressure nor improve endothelial dysfunction. This study concludes that the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone, natriuretic peptide, and bradykinin systems are directly involved in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular remodeling in the DOCA-salt model of hypertension in rats, which may be independent of their effects on blood pressure.", 
    "163": "The onset of cardiac cachexia is characterized by a defined severe weight loss in patients with advanced chronic heart failure and it predicts an increased mortality in these patients. Recent studies with potential therapeutics investigated the effects and efficiency of beta-blockers, ghrelin, or ghrelin-agonists in cachexia. These and other new studies, like the influence of heart transplantation on cardiac cachexia, give prospect into potential therapeutic options in the future. General aim of the treatment strategy is to prevent the onset and retard the progress of cachexia. This could be achieved by modifying the metabolic, neurohormonal and immune system abnormalities, e.g. with beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. However, these alterations interact in a complex pathophysiological process, which is supposed to end in a vicious circle and thereby the wasting process is further promoted. To interrupt this, an early start of therapy is important to decelerate the development of cardiac cachexia. Many further investigations are needed to find out more about the pathophysiological pathways, to confirm the previous results, and to evaluate new therapeutics.", 
    "164": "An emerging body of evidence suggests secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) may be an important covariant of congestive heart failure (CHF), especially in African-Americans (AA) where hypovitaminosis D is prevalent given that melanin, a natural sunscreen, mandates prolonged exposure of skin to sunlight and where a housebound lifestyle imposed by symptomatic CHF limits outdoor activities and hence sunlight exposure. In addition to the role of hypovitaminosis D in contributing to SHPT is the increased urinary and fecal losses of macronutrients Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) associated with the aldosteronism of CHF and their heightened urinary losses with furosemide treatment of CHF. Thus, a precarious Ca(2+) balance seen with reduced serum 25(OH)D is further compromised when AA develop CHF with circulating RAAS activation and are then treated with a loop diuretic. SHPT accounts for a paradoxical Ca(2+) overloading of diverse tissues and the induction of oxidative stress at these sites which spills over to the systemic circulation. In addition to SHPT, hypozincemia and hyposelenemia have been found in AA with compensated and decompensated heart failure and where an insufficiency of these micronutrients may have its origins in inadequate dietary intake, altered rates of absorption or excretion and/or tissue redistribution, and treatment with an ACE inhibitor or AT(1) receptor antagonist. Zn and Se deficiencies, which compromise the activity of several endogenous antioxidant defenses, could prove contributory to the severity of heart failure and its progressive nature. These findings call into question the need for nutriceutical treatment of heart failure and which is complementary to today's pharmaceuticals, especially in AA.", 
    "165": "Heart failure (HF) is a prevalent syndrome resulting in a high mortality rate. HF may be associated with zinc deficiency through a reduction in dietary intake, decreased absorption due to gastrointestinal edema, impaired motility or intestinal zinc losses. Diseases concomitant with HF such as diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension may enhance zinc deficiency. Medications given for HF may affect zinc metabolism in different ways. It was shown that thiazides may cause zincuria and a decrease in tissue zinc concentration. There is conflicting evidence about furosemide, even though patients with chronic furosemide treatment showed low tissue zinc levels in autopsies. Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) resulted in zincuria and zinc deficiency, but this outcome was not consistent in all studies. Beta-blockers did not alter plasma zinc concentration. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and ACE are zinc-containing enzymes, which play a role in the process of remodeling in HF. It was shown that ACE inhibitors may inhibit the activity of different MMPs. The exact interrelationship between HF, zinc-containing enzymes, zinc deficiency and the clinical manifestation of HF has to be investigated.",

Treatment of immunocompromised mice bearing MethA tumors or RenCa kidney tumors with captopril did not affect tumor formation nor survival, respectively. Captopril-treated mice immunized with AdLacZ or AdGFP vectors did not generate or generated decreased numbers of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells, respectively.

The Pf-TDH protein has been functionally produced in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. The enzyme has a tetrameric conformation with a molecular mass of approximately 155 kDa. The catalytic activity of the enzyme increases up to 100 degrees C, and a half-life of 11 min at this temperature indicates its thermostability. The enzyme is specific for NAD(H), and maximal specific activities were detected with L-threonine (10.3 U x mg(-1)) and acetoin (3.9 U x mg(-1)) in the oxidative and reductive reactions, respectively. Pf-TDH also utilizes L-serine and D-threonine as substrate, but could not oxidize other L-amino acids.

Such therapies include angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta-blockers, and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). Diuretics are the most commonly prescribed class of drugs in CHF patients and in the short term they remain the most efficacious treatment for relief from fluid congestion. There is, however, scant evidence to suggest that they confer any long term benefit in terms of disease progression or prognosis to the CHF sufferer. Injudicious use of diuretics has been demonstrated to be potentially harmful and consideration should be paid to avoiding dietary salt indiscretion as well as the pharmacokinetic properties of individual diuretics to achieve optimal diuretic response. In this article, we explore the current insight into the use of diuretics in CHF.", 
    "177": "Since the first identification of renin by Tigerstedt and Bergmann in 1898, the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been extensively studied. The current view of the system is characterized by an increased complexity, as evidenced by the discovery of new functional components and pathways of the RAS. In recent years, the pathophysiological implications of the system have been the main focus of attention, and inhibitors of the RAS such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin (ANG) II receptor blockers have become important clinical tools in the treatment of cardiovascular and renal diseases such as hypertension, heart failure, and diabetic nephropathy. Nevertheless, the tissue RAS also plays an important role in mediating diverse physiological functions. These focus not only on the classical actions of ANG on the cardiovascular system, namely, the maintenance of cardiovascular homeostasis, but also on other functions. Recently, the research efforts studying these noncardiovascular effects of the RAS have intensified, and a large body of data are now available to support the existence of numerous organ-based RAS exerting diverse physiological effects. ANG II has direct effects at the cellular level and can influence, for example, cell growth and differentiation, but also may play a role as a mediator of apoptosis. These universal paracrine and autocrine actions may be important in many organ systems and can mediate important physiological stimuli. Transgenic overexpression and knock-out strategies of RAS genes in animals have also shown a central functional role of the RAS in prenatal development. Taken together, these findings may become increasingly important in the study of organ physiology but also for a fresh look at the implications of these findings for organ pathophysiology.", 
    "178": "Congestive heart failure (CHF) is characterized by abnormal vasoconstriction and an impairment in nitric oxide (NO)-mediated vasodilatation. We have previously demonstrated that the decrease in sensitivity to NO lies at least partially at the level of the smooth muscle and is due to a reduction in the relative expression of the leucine zipper positive (LZ(+)) isoform of the myosin targeting subunit (MYPT1) of myosin light chain phosphatase. We hypothesized that since the attenuated vasodilatory response to NO in CHF has been shown to be secondary to an increased activity of the renin-angiotensin system, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition could affect MYPT1 isoform expression. To test this hypothesis, a rat myocardial infarction (MI) model of CHF was used; following left coronary artery ligation, rats were divided into control and captopril-treated groups. A third group of rats was given prazosin for 4 weeks. In the untreated control group, left ventricular function (LVF) was reduced at 2 weeks post-MI and remained at this level. Captopril treatment attenuated the fall in LVF. In the control aorta and iliac artery, the expression of the LZ(+) MYPT1 isoform fell 44-52% between 2 and 4 weeks post-MI, whereas in animals treated with captopril, MYPT1 isoform expression did not change. A decrease in the sensitivity to cGMP-mediated smooth muscle relaxation occurred coincident with the decrease in LZ(+) MYPT1 expression. The change in LZ(+) MYPT1 expression was not due to the decrease in afterload, as prazosin therapy produced an improvement in LVF but did not increase the relative expression of LZ(+) MYPT1 isoform. These data suggest that ACE inhibition, unique from pure afterload reduction, prevents MYPT1 isoform switching, which would preserve normal flow, or NO-mediated vasodilatation.",

Patients with LVH are at increased risk for stroke, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, and sudden cardiac death. Hypertension is a major influence on the development of LVH. The prognostic power of LVH is likely multifactorial. LVH represents both a manifestation of the effects of hypertension and other cardiac risk factors over time as well as an intrinsic condition causing pathologic changes in cardiac structure and function. Angiotensin II plays a central role in the development of LVH. Several antihypertensive treatments, especially angiotensin II receptor blockers, can reverse LVH and improve cardiovascular outcomes independent of blood pressure reduction. Further studies are required to determine if these agents should become first-line therapy for all patients with hypertension and LVH.",

    "200": "It has been well accepted that hepatic drug extraction depends on the blood flow, vascular binding, transmembrane barriers, transporters, enzymes and cosubstrate and their zonal heterogeneity. Models of hepatic drug clearances have been appraised with respect to their utility in predicting drug removal by the liver. Among these models, the \"well-stirred\" model is the simplest since it assumes venous equilibration, with drug emerging from the outflow being in equilibrium with drug within the liver, and the concentration is the same throughout. The \"parallel tube\" and dispersion models, and distributed model of Goresky and co-workers have been used to account for the observed sinusoidal concentration gradient from the inlet and outlet. Departure from these models exists to include heterogeneity in flow, enzymes, and transporters. This article utilized the physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) liver model and its extension that include heterogeneity in enzymes and transporters to illustrate how in vitro uptake and metabolic data from zonal hepatocytes on transport and enzymes may be used to predict the kinetics of removal in the intact liver; binding data were also necessary. In doing so, an integrative platform was provided to examine determinants of hepatic drug clearance. We used enalapril and digoxin as examples, and described a simple liver PBPK model that included transmembrane transport and metabolism occurring behind the membrane, and a zonal model in which the PBPK model was expanded three sets of sub-compartments that are arranged sequentially to represent zones 1, 2, and 3 along the flow path. The latter model readily accommodated the heterogeneous distribution of hepatic enzymes and transporters. Transport and metabolic data, piecewise information that served as initial estimates, allowed for the unknown efflux and other intrinsic clearances to be estimated. The simple or zonal PBPK model provides predictive views on the hepatic removal of drugs and metabolites.",

The captopril treatment (16 and 32 microg/kg; i.v.) resulted in a significant (p < 0.05) increase in survival time of SHR when compared with that of saline-treated control SHR. Kinin B(2) receptor antagonist (4 microg/kg; i.v.) pretreatment abolished (p > 0.05) the beneficial effect of captopril on the survival time when compared with that in saline-treated control SHR. Both the ligation of coronary artery and captopril treatment resulted in a significant (p < 0.001) fall in systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and heart rate (HR) of SHR when compared with those of the saline-treated control SHR. In addition, captopril administration caused a significant (p < 0.05) fall in SBP, DBP, and HR of SHR before ligation of the coronary artery (preligation). However, there was no significant change (p > 0.05) in SBP, DBP, and HR between saline- and kinin B(2) receptor antagonist plus captopril-treated SHR during preligation. These finding might indicate that captopril possesses a cardioprotective property as demonstrated by an increase in the survival time of SHR. This beneficial effect of captopril is mediated via the kinin B(2) receptor pathway because kinin B(2) receptor antagonist pretreatment blocked the captopril-induced increase in the survival time of SHR.", 
    "202": "Progression of sclerosis and stenosis is substantially unpredictable in the individual patient: in some cases it is very slow, in others it is accelerated. In addition, different patterns of progression (linear and non-linear) are possible. It has been suggested that the aortic valve lesion can be considered a form within the spectrum of the same atherosclerotic disease. In this context it seemed reasonable to hypothesize that targeted medical therapy could retard the progression of the disease. In particular HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been tested. The first experimental and clinical studies are now available, even though they are not conclusive to date. Large, prospective, randomized trials are ideally needed, but they are quite difficult, if not even impossible, to realize in practice. The ASSIST study (Asymptomatic aortic Sclerosis/Stenosis: Influence of STatins) of the Italian Society of Cardiovascular Echography aims to create a large, prospective, observational investigation, involving many centers of echocardiography and thousands of patients, in order to provide from the real clinical world at least some of the answers to this unsolved question.",

Patients (n=8290) were randomly assigned to receive trandolapril (target, 4 mg/d) or placebo. Clinical creatinine measures were available for 8280 patients before randomization. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated with the 4-point Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation. Renal function was related to outcomes, and the influence of ACE-inhibitor therapy was assessed with formal interaction modeling. The mean eGFR in PEACE was 77.6+/-19.4, and 1355 (16.3%) patients had reduced renal function (eGFR <60 mg.mL(-1).1.73 m(-2)). We observed a significant interaction between eGFR and treatment group with respect to cardiovascular and all-cause mortality (P=0.02). Trandolapril was associated with a reduction in total mortality in patients with reduced renal function (adjusted HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.54 to 1.00) but not in patients with preserved renal function (adjusted HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.78 to 1.13).",

The more recently developed angiotensin II receptor antagonists appear to yield similar fetal abnormalities. We report a premature infant born to a 41-year-old mother with a long history of infertility who had received losartan therapy for hypertension throughout an undetected pregnancy. Ultrasound examination 2 days prior to delivery identified a single fetus at 29 weeks gestation, anhydramnios, and an empty fetal bladder. The neonatal course was complicated by oliguria, hyperkalemia, marked renal dysfunction, respiratory failure, joint contractures, and a large anterior fontanelle with widely separated sutures. Hypotension (mean arterial pressure<25 torr) on day 1 responded to volume expansion, dopamine, and hydrocortisone. Serum creatinine reached a maximum of 2.7 mg/dL on day 6 and decreased to 0.4 by day 56. No formal urinalysis was performed, but the urine was reported to be visually clear throughout the course. Although a renal ultrasound on day 2 was normal, a follow-up study at 7 months revealed bilateral generalized parenchymal echogenicity, consistent with medical renal disease. Since then, weight and length have been at the 5th percentile or less, with apparent renal tubular acidosis necessitating the addition of sodium citrate supplements. This case emphasizes the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for potential pregnancy when contemplating the use of a drug of this class, and considering serial testing for pregnancy when using such drugs, even in patients with a longstanding history of infertility.", 
    "207": "It had been believed that angiotensin II (Ang II) was produced by the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which was established in the 1950's. After a while, people realized that the multiple functions of Ang II could not be explained by the conventional RAS. We have tried to determine the existence of the tissue Ang II generating system. At first, we found that vascular angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) was increased to generate local Ang II in the vessels of hypertension and was enhanced in lipid-loaded atherosclerosis, to respond to ACE inhibitor or Ang II antagonist (ARB). In both cases, Ang II production in vessels was independent from the systemic RAS that was estimated by the plasma renin activity. On the way to clarifying the roles of the vascular ACE, we noticed that vascular Ang II production was not completely suppressed by ACE inhibitor alone. This evidence led us to discover different types of chymase as a new Ang II producing enzyme. Now, we have obtained a strategy to distinguish the Ang II one by one, that is, circulating RAS derived, tissue ACE derived, and chymase derived. It is essential to understand not only the intracellular mechanisms of Ang II but also the process of Ang II productions in each disease to show accurate indications of the effectiveness of ACE inhibitor, ARB, and chymase inhibitor.", 
    "208": "Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with either an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) was shown to decrease urinary protein excretion and slow the progression of both diabetic and nondiabetic proteinuric renal disease. The safety and efficacy of combined ACE-inhibitor and ARB therapy is not well established. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials evaluating the combination of an ACE inhibitor and an ARB in patients with chronic proteinuric renal disease. Twenty-one randomized controlled studies (n = 654 patients) were identified using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central databases. Five trials had a parallel-group design and 16 trials used a crossover design. Combination therapy with an ACE inhibitor and an ARB resulted in a small, but significant, increase in serum potassium levels (weighted mean difference, 0.11 mEq/L [0.11 mmol/L]; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.05 to 0.17) and a nonsignificant decrease in glomerular filtration rate (weighted mean difference, 1.4 mL/min [0.02 mL/s]; 95% CI, -2.6 to 0.2). Addition of an ARB resulted in a further decrease in proteinuria (weighted mean difference, 440 mg/d; 95% CI, 289 to 591) compared with an ACE inhibitor alone. This effect was observed in patients with diabetic (210 mg/d; 95% CI, 84 to 336) and nondiabetic (582 mg/d; 95% CI, 371 to 793) renal disease. In conclusion, the combination of ACE-inhibitor and ARB therapy in patients with chronic proteinuric renal disease is safe, without clinically meaningful changes in serum potassium levels or glomerular filtration rates. Combination therapy also was associated with a significant decrease in proteinuria, at least in the short term. Additional trials with longer follow-up are needed to determine whether the decrease in proteinuria will result in significant preservation of renal function.", 
    "209": "A correct representation of intermolecular interaction energies is necessary for reliable drug-receptor docking studies. While ab initio quantum chemistry with extended basis sets is the most accurate tool for that purpose, its use is precluded for very large molecular complexes. This constitutes the incentive for the development of accurate molecular mechanics potentials, in which the first-order electrostatic, and the second-order polarization energy contributions, are of essential importance. In this paper, we review the most important steps in the development of anisotropic, polarizable molecular mechanics (APMM) procedures. Among these, we illustrate validation tests of the ab initio-grounded, polarizable molecular mechanics potential, SIBFA (Sum of Interactions Between Fragments Ab initio computed). These are done by comparisons with parallel quantum-chemical (QC) results on representative multiply hydrogen-bonded complexes and polycoordinated complexes of one, or of two, divalent metal cations. For both kinds of complexes, the need to reproduce the non-additivity of the QC interaction energies is emphasized. One difficulty arises upon handling flexible molecules, due to the need to account simultaneously and consistently for the onset of inter- and intra-molecular polarization and charge-transfer effects. A new approach in the context of SIBFA was recently developed towards this aim, and tested in two cases of conformation-dependent cation-ligand interaction energies. The first relates to the complexes formed between the mecapto-carboxamide anion, an essential building-block of several Zn-metalloenzyme inhibitors, and Zn(II). The second relates to the complexes of the tetra-anionic pyrophosphate anion, a key building-block of ATP and GTP, with one or two divalent Zn(II) cations used as a probe. In the domain of applications, two recent studies are then presented. The first is the docking of the captopril drug to the active site of the binuclear Zn(II)- beta-lactamase enzyme. The second is the complex of a non-hydrolyzable analog of ATP with the active site of a binuclear Mg(II)-dependent kinase. An extension to an open-shell cation, Cu(II), is finally presented. The encouraging results presented in this review show that APMM procedures could be used in large-scale studies of ligand and drug-receptor interactions.",

Our objective was to describe the use of in-hospital cardiac medical therapy among patients undergoing open AAA repair and to examine the effect of perioperative cardiac medical therapy on in-hospital mortality. We examined clinical data and in-hospital medication use among 223 patients who underwent open AAA repair at three North American hospitals, all of which used the Transition resource and cost accounting system. Medication use was described [angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, aspirin, ss-blockers, and statins] within the cohort at five specific periods of time: presurgery, day of surgery, 1 day after surgery, postsurgery, and discharge. We then performed a matched case-control study where cases were defined as patients who died in-hospital. We compared medication use between cases and controls to assess its impact on in-hospital mortality. Most patients were elderly (mean age 72.5 +/- 9.8 years), 70.4% were male, and in-hospital mortality within the cohort was 10.8%. Medication use in all periods of administration was low. ss-Blocker use was highest among all classes on the day of surgery, with 20.6% of patients undergoing AAA repair receiving the medication. Less than 50% of patients received any of the medications at discharge. After adjusting for baseline differences, perioperative ACE inhibitor use showed a trend toward a protective effect [odds ratio (OR) = 0.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01-1.31, p = 0.08], and perioperative ss-blocker use was significantly associated with a decrease in mortality (OR = 0.07, 95% CI 0.01-0.87, p = 0.04). Cardiac medical therapy among patients undergoing AAA repair is low throughout all periods of hospitalization.

    "232": "A minor increase in urinary albumin excretion (microalbuminuria) is known to predict adverse renal and cardiovascular events in diabetic and hypertensive patients. Recent intriguing findings show that microalbuminuria is an early and sensitive marker of future cardiovascular events even in healthy subjects. The mechanisms linking microalbuminuria with end-organ damage have not been fully explained yet; however, generalized endothelial dysfunction might play an important role. Prevailing experimental and clinical data suggest that generalized endothelial dysfunction, frequently characterized by decreased nitric oxide bioavailability, actually precedes the development of microalbuminuria. This review summarizes the current knowledge about the intricate relationship between microalbuminuria and endothelial dysfunction. On the basis of the current evidence, we propose that microalbuminuria and endothelial dysfunction are an emerging target for primary prevention strategies in cardiovascular disease. In near future, dietary components improving nitric oxide bioavailability, such as cocoa-derived flavanols may play important role in these preventive strategies.", 
    "233": "The vascular endothelium synthesizes and releases a spectrum of vasoactive substances and therefore plays a fundamental role in the basal and dynamic regulation of the circulation. Nitric oxide (NO)-originally described as endothelium-derived relaxing factor-is released from endothelial cells in response to shear stress produced by blood flow, and in response to activation of a variety of receptors. After diffusion from endothelial to vascular smooth muscle cells, NO increases intracellular cyclic guanosine-monophosphate concentrations by activation of the enzyme guanylate cyclase leading to relaxation of the smooth muscle cells. NO has also antithrombogenic, antiproliferative, leukocyte-adhesion inhibiting effects, and influences myocardial contractility. Endothelium-derived NO-mediated vascular relaxation is impaired in spontaneously hypertensive animals. NO decomposition by free oxygen radicals is a major mechanism of impaired NO bioavailability. The resulting imbalance of endothelium-derived relaxing and contracting substances disturbs the normal function of the vascular endothelium. Endothelin acts as the natural counterpart to endothelium-derived NO. Besides its arterial blood pressure rising effect in humans, endothelin-1 induces vascular and myocardial hypertrophy, which are independent risk factors for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Current therapeutic strategies concentrate mainly on lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and an impressive reduction in the risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has been achieved. Inflammatory mechanisms play an important role in vascular disease and inflammatory plasma markers correlate with prognosis. The production of reactive oxygen species under pathological conditions may represent an important inflammatory trigger. Novel therapeutic strategies specifically targeting inflammation thus bear great potential for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerotic vascular disease. In this context, the vascular actions of flavanol-rich cocoa, particularly with regard to enhanced NO synthesis and endothelial function observed in humans following consumption, warrants further attention. This review discusses pharmacological and dietary intervention.", 
    "234": "Endothelial damage and platelet hyperactivity may play a role in the vascular complications of essential hypertension. Restoration of endothelial function and reduction of increased platelet aggregation in essential hypertension are one of the aims of modern anti-hypertensive therapy. Therefore, the effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on endothelial and platelet functions is of interest. In the present study, 23 healthy normotensives and 23 age- and sex-matched patients with non-treated essential hypertension (1st and 2nd stage according to WHO) were investigated. Measurements of endothelial and platelet functions in hypertensives were carried out before therapy, after 1 week of placebo administration, after 1 week and after 1 month of perindopril therapy in a once daily dose of 4 mg. Plasma thrombomodulin (ELISA method) and beta-thromboglobulin (radio immunoassay method) were assayed and platelet aggregation (spontaneous and induced by adrenaline) was measured. The values of plasma thrombomodulin, a novel marker of endothelial function, were compared between age- and sex-matched normotensives and hypertensives. A significant decrease of adrenaline-induced platelet aggregation was observed after 1 month of perindopril therapy in comparison with the values before therapy or after 1 week of perindopril therapy ( P < 0.02 and P < 0.05 respectively). There were no significant changes in plasma thrombomodulin or beta-thromboglobulin following therapy. We failed to find significant changes of plasma thrombomodulin in patients in the early stages of hypertension, but its tendency to be higher than in normotensives does not rule out some vascular damage. The inhibitory effect of perindopril on platelet aggregation may be a further advantage of this drug. Since no changes were found after 1 week of therapy, the reduction of adrenaline-induced platelet aggregation after 1 month of therapy may be explained by an indirect effect of perindopril on platelet function, probably asa result of protective action on the arterial wall.",

The oedema was refractory to conventional allergy treatment. Shortly thereafter, the patient was treated with fresh frozen plasma, and within a few hours his condition improved, allowing extubation. Familial history and exposure to potentially angio-oedema causative drugs were not evident. The serum complement status was normal, and no IgE sensitisation was detected. We therefore concluded that the patient was suffering from idiopathic non-histaminergic angio-oedema. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of an acute, life-threatening attack of idiopathic non-histaminergic angio-oedema that was successfully treated with fresh frozen plasma.",

He had been taking a Chinese herbal remedy for allergic rhinitis for the past 10 years, together with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I; enalapril, 20 mg daily). After the dosage of enalapril had been reduced to 10 mg daily about 1(1/2) years before the current admission, he had developed persistent constipation. Therefore, he had started taking another traditional Chinese herbal remedy, a laxative, for the constipation, about 4 months prior to this hospitalization. Laboratory data on admission demonstrated marked metabolic alkalosis with severe hypokalemia associated with urinary wasting of potassium and chloride. A diagnosis of pseudoaldosteronism was made based upon his past history of exposure to various traditional Chinese medicines containing glycyrrhizin. Discontinuation of the Chinese remedies and supplementation of potassium successfully normalized the electrolyte imbalance and relieved all symptoms within a short time. The present case describes the occurrence of pseudoaldosteronism induced by a patient taking two traditional Chinese herbs, both containing glycyrrhizin, resulting in an overdose of this causative chemical agent. The development of pseudoaldosteronism appeared to be of particular interest with regard to the interaction of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) system with glycyrrhizin, in which an ACE-I retarded the development of pseudoaldosteronism.", 
    "242": "Hypotension occurs during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), in part because of induction of the inflammatory response, for which nitric oxide and guanylate cyclase play a central role. In this study we examined the hemodynamic effects of methylene blue (MB), an inhibitor of guanylate cyclase, administered during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) to patients taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Thirty patients undergoing cardiac surgery were randomized to receive either MB (3 mg/kg) or saline (S) after institution of CPB and cardioplegic arrest. CPB was managed similarly for all study patients. Hemodynamic data were assessed before, during, and after CPB. The use of vasopressors was recorded. All study patients experienced a similar reduction in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) with the onset of CPB and cardioplegic arrest. MB increased MAP and SVR and this effect lasted for 40 minutes. The saline group demonstrated a persistently reduced MAP and SVR throughout CPB. The saline group received phenylephrine more frequently during CPB, and more norepinephrine after CPB to maintain a desirable MAP. The MB group recorded significantly lower serum lactate levels despite equal or greater MAP and SVR. In conclusion, administration of MB after institution of CPB for patients taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors increased MAP and SVR and reduced the need for vasopressors. Furthermore, serum lactate levels were lower in MB patients, suggesting more favorable tissue perfusion.", 
    "243": "Achieving target blood pressure (BP) levels in clinical practice is one of the main challenges for physicians in the management of patients with hypertension. It is now recognised that the majority of patients will require at least two antihypertensive drugs to achieve optimal BP control; the use of combination therapy as first-line treatment is also increasing as BP goals of antihypertensive therapy become more ambitious. The fixed combination of zofenopril/hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 30/12.5 mg/day is approved in Italy, France, Switzerland and Greece for the management of mild to moderate hypertension. In clinical trials comparing zofenopril/HCTZ with each agent administered as monotherapy, combination therapy was more effective in normalising BP. This effect was particularly evident in one trial in which patients who were nonresponsive to zofenopril monotherapy were studied. In addition, in clinical trials to date, combination therapy provided sustained and consistent BP control over the entire 24-hour dose interval. Despite the greater efficacy of zofenopril/HCTZ 30/12.5 mg/day, when directly compared with each agent administered as monotherapy, there were no significant differences in the nature, severity or incidence of treatment-related adverse events; headache, dizziness, cough and polyuria were most frequently reported. Notably, in one study, fewer patients discontinued treatment with combination therapy than with zofenopril monotherapy due to adverse events. In conclusion, zofenopril/HCTZ 30/12.5 mg/day provides more optimal BP control in a larger proportion of patients than would be achievable with monotherapy, while maintaining the tolerability profile observed with each individual agent, and thereby potentially enhancing patient compliance. The efficacy and safety profiles of this combination shown in clinical trials to date indicate that it will be a useful addition to currently available therapy for patients who have mild to moderate hypertension that is not adequately controlled by monotherapy, as well as for patients who require more rapid, intensive BP control.",

The lag time between onset of symptoms to diagnosis ranged from 1 month to 5 years with mean (+/- SD) of 1.09 +/- 1.02 years. The majority of children presented with hypertension and paroxysms. Paroxysms, characterized by the triad of headache, palpitations and sweating, was present in 13 (68%) of these patients. Twelve (63%) patients had postural fall in blood pressure, ten (53%) had abdominal pain, four (21%) had visual blurring, and three (16%) each had palpable abdominal mass and significant weight loss at presentation. Nausea and vomiting are common symptoms in children with pheochromocytoma and were present in six (32%) and three (16%) patients, respectively. Caf\u00e9-au-lait macule was present in only two (11%) patients. Urinary vanilyl mandelic acid (VMA) was found to be significantly high in ten (53%) patients, and urinary epinephrine and norepinephrine in eight (42%).

    "254": "From the standpoint of health gains, the significant rise in antihypertensive drug utilization represents a potentially favorable development in terms of increased numbers of patients undergoing drug treatment. Compared to other European countries, the data showed greater use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system in Portugal and less use of diuretics and beta-blockers. Most national and international guidelines recommend diuretics as first-line agents in HT treatment. Considering that these drugs have the lowest daily treatment cost, a high, and increasing, rate of utilization would be expected, but this is not the case in Portugal.", 
    "255": "This study reveals not only significant differences in antihypertensive drug utilization at the regional level in Portugal but also a lack of adherence to national and international guidelines, and therefore more attention should be paid to their implementation in order to improve health gains.", 
    "256": "The cardiac conduction system (CCS) is responsible for generation and systematic conduction of cardiac impulses. The Bachmann Bundle (BB), considered one of its several accessory impulse-conducting pathways, plays a fundamental role in interatrial conduction. Delay in this pathway leads to prolongation of the P wave on the electrocardiogram (interatrial delay or block), which in turn is a precursor for atrial tachyarrhythmias, mainly atrial fibrillation and significant left atrial electromechanical dysfunction. As such, the magnitude of its sequelae has necessitated a flurry of investigations that have been targeted toward its prevention and management. Although current studies on the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and atrial pacing have indeed shown some promise, it would be shortsighted to overlook and circumvent the actual underlying lesion-BB abnormality. Thus, a thorough understanding of the CCS and interatrial conduction is essential. We review current literature on the BB and discuss potential mechanisms that affect its conduction.", 
    "257": "Chymase is a chymotrypsin-like serine protease stored as an inactive enzyme within the secretory granules of mast cells. An important action of chymase is the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-independent synthesis of angiotensin II, which occurs immediately after its release into the interstitial tissues after vascular injury. Under physiological conditions, the role of chymase is uncertain, but under pathologic situations, chymase may have an important role. Pharmacologic strategies that serve to inhibit chymase function may prove to be useful in the setting of vascular injury.", 
    "258": "Recent articles have inquired about the quality of care for women presenting with cardiovascular disease. The Cooperative Cardiovascular Project and the National Heart Failure Project, 2 Medicare databases, provide national data to address concerns that women receive poorer quality care than men. In these databases, sex was not independently associated with the use of beta-blockers, assessment of left ventricular ejection fraction, or use of fibrinolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction (MI), nor of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor prescription for heart failure. Women with MI were slightly less likely to receive aspirin and slightly more likely to receive ACE inhibitors. Among patients with equivocal indications, men were significantly more likely than women to undergo cardiac catheterization, whereas there were no sex differences among patients with strong indication. Women were more likely than men to undergo percutaneous coronary intervention and less likely to receive coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Short-term mortality rates after MI and readmission rates after heart failure did not vary significantly by gender; however, risk of mortality after heart failure was slightly lower for women. Within multivariate models, gender differences in treatment were small and in many cases insignificant. These national datasets fail to reveal a strong sex bias in treatment among patients aged > or = 65 years.", 
    "259": "Most cases of nephrotic syndrome following stem cell transplantation (SCT) occur 6 months after SCT. The patients are treated with immunosuppressive therapies; however, in some cases treatment is not effective. We used enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and candesartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), for the control of proteinuria in a case of immunosuppressive treatment (IST)-resistant nephrotic syndrome. A 15-year-old boy with acute lymphoblastic leukemia underwent allogeneic peripheral blood SCT from a completely HLA-matched sibling after completion of a conditioning regimen composed of 12-Gy doses of total-body irradiation, 600 mg/m2 thiotepa, and 140 mg/m2 melphalan. Twenty-eight months after SCT, minimal-change nephrotic syndrome was diagnosed on the basis of biopsy findings. Although neither cyclosporine (trough level, 100-150 ng/mL) nor corticosteroid was effective, proteinuria disappeared 2 months after the beginning of treatment with tacrolimus (trough level, 13-20 ng/mL), and remission was maintained for 23 months. Nephrotic syndrome recurred, however, and was resistant to tacrolimus. Findings at the second renal biopsy revealed membranous nephropathy. An ARB (candesartan, 4 mg/ day) in combination with an ACEI (enalapril, 5 mg/day) was started. Proteinuria improved within 2 weeks. We suggest that ARB combined with ACEI can be used to control proteinuria in patients with IST-resistant nephrotic syndrome after SCT.", 
    "260": "Renin is the rate-limiting enzyme in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAS) which controls blood pressure and volume. The biological function of renin is to cleave the N-terminus of angiotensinogen releasing the decapeptide, angiotensin I (ANGI). Subsequently, angiotensin I is further processed by the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) to produce angiotensin II (ANGII). The RAS cascade is a major target for the clinical management of hypertension. Current clinical treatments include angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and ANGII receptor blockers (ARBs). As the rate-limiting enzyme in ANGII production, renin inhibitors have been pursued as an additional class of anti-hypertensives. Clinical studies conducted with renin inhibitors have shown them to be as effective as ACE inhibitors in lowering blood pressure. Most importantly, inhibitors of renin may have a number of potential advantages over ACEi and ARBs. Renin is specific for angiotensinogen and will not carry the ancillary pharmacology associated with ACEi or ARBs. To date, no renin inhibitors have made it to market. The development of these inhibitors has been hindered by poor bioavailability and complex synthesis. However, despite the pharmacokinetic challenges of designing renin inhibitors, the enzyme remains a promising target for the development of novel treatments for hypertension. This review will consist of an overview of renin biology, the pharmacology of renin and RAS and focus in on renin as a target for blood pressure regulation. We also cover the evaluation of renin inhibitors in animal models and clinical studies. Presently a number of new generation inhibitors of renin are in development with at least one in the clinic and these will be discussed. Finally we will discuss what might distinguish renin inhibitors from current therapeutic options and discuss other therapeutic indications renin inhibitors might have.", 
    "261": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduce morbidity, mortality, hospital admissions, and decline in physical function and exercise capacity in congestive heart failure (CHF) patients. These therapeutic effects are attributed primarily to beneficial cardiovascular actions of these drugs. However, it has been suggested that ACE inhibitor-induced positive effects may also be mediated by direct action on the skeletal muscle. In particular, two recently published observational studies documented that among hypertensive subjects free of CHF, treatment with ACE inhibitors was associated with better performance and muscular outcomes and genetic studies also support the hypothesis that the ACE system may be involved in physical performance and skeletal muscle function. Effects on the skeletal muscle are probably mediated by mechanical, metabolic, anti-inflammatory, nutritional, neurological and angiogenetic actions of these drugs. These studies may have major public health implications for older adults, as consequence of the fact that, in this population, gradual loss of muscle mass and muscle strength can play a key role in the onset and progression of disability. Therefore, if findings of observational studies will be later confirmed in randomized controlled trials, ACE inhibitors could represent an effective intervention to prevent physical decline in the elderly, leading to greater autonomy in this growing population.", 
    "262": "The assay of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition by food-derived peptides is usually carried out by using soluble ACE in a batch process. The purification of this enzyme from tissues is not an easy task, and the resulting preparation loses activity very fast. In addition, ACE commercial preparations are very expensive. In this work the immobilization of ACE, through lysine amino groups, to 4% beads cross-linked (4 BCL) glyoxyl-agarose is described. The amount of immobilized enzyme increased with increasing concentrations of enzyme and with incubation time until a saturation point was reached at 50 mg protein/mL gel and 3.5 hours, respectively. The IC50 values for a noncompetitive sunflower peptide inhibitor were similar for the soluble (30.56 microM) and immobilized (32.7 microM) enzymes. An immobilized derivative was obtained that was 60 times more stable than the soluble enzyme at 60 degrees C. This procedure yields a derivative that can be reused and has increased thermal stability compared to that of the soluble enzyme. Thus, ACE immobilization is a good alternative to using soluble freshly prepared or commercial preparations because of economical and practical reasons.", 
    "263": "Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE), a dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase, catalyzes the conversion of Angiotensin I to the potent vasoconstrictor Angiotensin II and plays an important physiological role in regulating blood pressure. Inhibitors of angiotensin 1-converting enzyme derived from food proteins are utilized for pharmaceuticals and physiologically functional foods. ACE inhibitory properties of different enzymatic hydrolysates of glycinin, the major storage protein of soybean, have been demonstrated. The IC50 value for the different enzyme digests ranges from 4.5 to 35 microg of N2. The Protease P hydrolysate contained the most potent suite of ACE inhibitory peptides. The ACE inhibitory activity of the Protease P hydrolysate after fractionation by RP-HPLC and ion-pair chromatography was ascribed to a single peptide. The peptide was homogeneous as evidenced by MALDI-TOF and identified to be a pentapeptide. The sequence was Val-Leu-Ile-Val-Pro. This peptide was synthesized using solid-phase FMOC chemistry. The IC50 for ACE inhibition was 1.69 +/- 0.17 microM. The synthetic peptide was a potent competitive inhibitor of ACE with a Ki of 4.5 +/- 0.25 x 10(-6) M. This peptide was resistant to digestion by proteases of the gastrointestinal tract. The antihypertensive property of this peptide derived from glycinin might find importance in the development of therapeutic functional foods.", 
    "264": "Clinical-and-hemodynamic effects were studied of a supplementary use of a selective beta-adrenoblocker metoprolol in an ongoing therapy of chronic cardiac insufficiency (CCI) with inhibitors of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACEI) and diuretics. It has been found out that long (over 8 weeks) course of therapy supplemented with metoprolol results in improvement of the left ventricular systolic function and lowering of the functional class. Long-term administration of metoprolol enhances tolerance to a graded physical exercise in CCI patients, which observation is accompanied by a more economic character of its performance. The findings secured validate the expediency of a supplementary use of the beta-adrenoblocker metoprolol in the routine regimen of the supporting treatment of CCI patients involving the use of ACEI plus a diuretic.", 
    "265": "Medication choices for the treatment of elevated blood pressure have a large potential impact on both patient outcomes and health care costs. Historic trends of prescribing for hypertension will advance the understanding of physician practice of evidence-based medicine. This study describes both long- and short-term trends in US antihypertensive prescribing from 1990 through 2004. Data were extracted from the National Disease and Therapeutic Index, a continuing survey of a national sample of US office-based physicians. Cox and Stuart and z tests were performed. Diuretics ranked among the top 3 antihypertensive drug classes throughout the entire study time span. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) were preferred over diuretics beginning in 1993, with diuretics surpassing CCBs in 2000. Beta-blockers were consistently the fourth most common class until 2002, when exceeded by angiotensin II receptor antagonists (ARBs). Most recent trends indicated an immediate but short-lived increase in the prescription of thiazide diuretics after the new clinical evidence released in December 2002 demonstrating clinical equivalence of thiazides to ACE inhibitors and CCBs. In contrast, prescription of ACE inhibitors declined, accompanied by continuation of a pre-existing increase in the prescription of ARBs, whereas prescription of CCBs remained essentially stable after the new evidence was released. The recorded long- and short-term trends indicate that evidence-based clinical recommendations had an impact on antihypertensive prescribing practices, but the magnitude of impact may be smaller and of more limited duration than desired.", 
    "266": "Lowering elevated blood pressure (BP) in diabetic hypertensive individuals decreases cardiovascular events. We questioned whether remodeling of resistance arteries from hypertensive diabetic patients would improve after 1 year of tight BP control with addition of either the angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) valsartan or the beta-blocker (BB) atenolol to previous therapy, which included angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and/or calcium channel blockers. Twenty-eight hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients treated with oral hypoglycemic and antihypertensive agents (not receiving ARBs or BBs) were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment for 1 year with valsartan (80 to 160 mg) or atenolol (50 to 100 mg) daily, added to previous therapy. Resistance arteries dissected from gluteal subcutaneous tissues were assessed on a pressurized myograph. After 1 year of treatment, systolic and diastolic BP and glycemia were equally well controlled in the valsartan and atenolol groups. Endothelium-dependent and independent relaxation did not change in the treated groups. After 1 year of treatment, resistance artery media:lumen ratio decreased in the valsartan group (7.9+/-0.5% after versus 9.8+/-0.6% before; P < 0.05) but not in the atenolol-treated group (9.9+/-0.9% versus 10.6+/-1%; P value not significant). Artery walls from atenolol-treated patients became stiffer, with no change in the valsartan-treated patients. In conclusion, similar intensive BP control for 1 year with valsartan was associated with improved structure of resistance arteries in diabetic hypertensive patients, whereas vessels from atenolol-treated patients exhibited unchanged remodeling and a stiffer wall. The addition of ARBs but not BBs to antihypertensive medications that may include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and/or calcium channel blockers results in an improvement in resistance artery remodeling in diabetic hypertensive patients.", 
    "267": "Inflammation is a key mechanism in the initiation, progression, and clinical sequelae of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), including atherosclerosis, nephropathy, and cardiomyopathy. Angiotensin II, the major effector peptide of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), plays a significant role in the advent and perpetuation of these inflammatory diseases, most notably in atherogenesis. Consequently, suppression of the influence of angiotensin II by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers may reduce or potentially reverse atherosclerosis and other inflammation-associated CVDs. Angiotensin II receptor blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors exert anti-inflammatory actions and prevent or reduce the development of atherosclerosis in animal models. Clinically, RAAS suppression reduces common carotid and femoral artery intima-media thickness, thus indicating moderation of the vascular disease process. These clinical benefits likely involve restraint of the deleterious effects of angiotensin II in addition to, or independent of, lowering blood pressure. Increasing evidence that the detection and monitoring of vascular inflammation are important tools in the management of atherosclerosis also implicates the RAAS in this pathogenic process. Inflammatory molecules such as intercellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and C-reactive protein have potential diagnostic and prognostic values in CVD and are modified by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. Monitoring these markers may be crucial for determining which agents, or combinations of agents, will result in the most clinically beneficial outcomes for patients. Large-scale trials are still required to determine the effects of the long-term suppression of inflammation on CVDs through the use of RAAS modulating agents, as well as to determine how closely markers of inflammatory activity may correlate with CVD outcomes.", 
    "268": "Whether angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are interchangeable and equally efficacious after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is controversial. We assessed whether ramipril was superior to other ACE inhibitors after AMI as suggested by a previously published study. We performed a retrospective cohort study using linked administrative databases on >1.4 million elderly residents in the province of Ontario who were admitted to the hospital for AMI, survived >or=30 days after discharge, and were initiated on an ACE inhibitor after AMI and remained on the same ACE inhibitor from April 1, 1997 to March 31, 2000. We followed patients for 2 years and measured readmission for AMI or mortality, together or alone. Our cohort included 5,408 elderly patients. Compared with patients on enalapril, there was no significant difference for the combined end points of readmission for AMI or mortality across users of ramipril (adjusted hazard ratio 0.95, 95% confidence interval 0.79 to 1.15), lisinopril (adjusted hazard ratio 1.02, 95% confidence interval 0.84 to 1.25), or other ACE inhibitors (adjusted hazard ratio 1.08, 95% confidence interval 0.88, 1.32). In conclusion, the findings of this study support a class effect among ACE inhibitors in treatment after AMI.",

This study was designed to investigate the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition on endothelial function in people who were obese but otherwise healthy. We performed a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study examining the effect of the ACE inhibitor perindopril (4 mg per day) on flow-mediated vasodilatation (FMD) of the brachial artery, arterial blood pressure, glucose homeostasis and inflammatory cytokines. Eighteen obese subjects (all body mass index > 30 kg/m2) were randomised to receive perindopril or placebo for four weeks. Perindopril led to a fall in systolic blood pressure from 131 (standard error of mean [SEM] 3) to 117(5) mmHg and diastolic blood pressure from 74(4) mmHg to 68(4) mmHg, both p<0.001. Despite this fall in blood pressure, ACE inhibition had no effect on FMD, 8.2 (1.2)% versus 8.3 (1.5)%, p=0.9. ACE inhibition had no effect on insulin, lipids or circulating cytokines. In healthy obese humans, despite a significant reduction in blood pressure, ACE inhibition had no effect on FMD.",

Cardiovascular morbidity appears to be similar in blacks and whites and depends on the classic cardiovascular risk factors. Kidney damage leading to end-stage renal disease is more frequent in blacks. Reduced salt intake improves drug efficacy. Diuretics and calcium channel blockers are more effective in lowering blood pressure, while angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors may be more effective in preventing organ damage. Specific trials are needed to evaluate therapeutic benefits in blacks.",

Two or even three different drugs are often necessary to reach this rather difficult goal. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are preferred for patients with renal damage. Proteinuria should be reduced to less than 0.5 g/day. Associated risk factors should be treated with equal effectiveness. In particular, LDL cholesterol should be lowered to less than 1 g/L when additional risk factors are present. Aspirin (0.75 mg a day) should be given routinely as soon as blood pressure is controlled.", 
    "274": "G-protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) 2 regulates a plethora of cellular processes, including cardiac expression and function of key seven-transmembrane receptors (7TM receptors) such as the beta-adrenergic and angiotensin receptors (Penela P, Murga C, Ribas C, et al.: 2006. Mechanisms of regulation of G-protein-coupled receptor kinases [GRKs] and cardiovascular disease. Cardiovasc Res 69:46-56, Rockman HA, Koch WJ, Lefkowitz RJ: 2002. Seven-transmembrane-spanning receptors and heart function. Nature 415:206-212). Interestingly, these two G-protein-coupled receptor systems are targeted by modern heart failure treatment including beta-adrenergic blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers. Although GRK2 is ubiquitously expressed, its particular importance in the heart has been demonstrated by interesting phenotypes of genetically altered mice that suggest GRK2 inhibition can ameliorate heart failure. In essence, this work suggests GRK2 could be an endogenous receptor blocker targeting both the beta-adrenergic and angiotensin receptors in the heart. This notion immediately suggests it is important to understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate GRK2 activity in the heart. In this review, we provide a detailed presentation of the tight regulation of GRK2 expression levels and protein activity, and we discuss the cardiovascular GRK2 functions and possible therapeutic perspectives.",

Prespecified outcomes were COPD hospitalization, MI, and total mortality.", 
    "278": "These drugs reduced both CV and pulmonary outcomes, with the largest benefits occurring with the combination of statins and either ACE inhibitors or ARBs.

    "280": "In women, breast cancer is the second most common form of cancer and the leading cause of death caused by malignancy. The anthracycline antibiotics are potent anti-tumor agents used in a wide spectrum of malignancies. They are part of the gold standard adjuvant therapy for breast cancer and in metastatic disease they provide significant increases in response rate, time to disease progression, and overall survival. The addition of trastuzumab augments the effects of anthracycline-based therapy in both the adjuvant and metastatic settings. The successful use of anthracyclines is, however, restricted by the risk of developing life-threatening congestive heart failure. This risk increases exponentially with cumulative dose, and is further augmented by the addition of trastuzumab. Studies have reported that 10% to 26% of patients administered cumulative anthracycline doses above those recommended (> or =500 mg/m2 for doxorubicin and 1,000 mg/m2 for epirubicin) develop congestive heart failure, and that more than 50% of patients administered these doses will experience measurable functional impairment months to years after the end of therapy. The susceptibility of patients to anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity varies widely, with a dramatic increase with advancing age. The onset of clinical and subclinical cardiac damage is delayed and occurs more than 3 months after the cessation of treatment, indicating a crucial time for functional impairment to occur and highlighting the ineffectiveness of monitoring left ventricular ejection fraction as an endpoint during anthracycline therapy. Possible future treatment options for managing anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity include agents such as dexrazoxane that prevent oxygen-free radical generation. Further investigation is required into the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors to redress cardiac damage and new methods of identifying patients at high risk of congestive heart failure before cardiac damage has occurred.", 
    "281": "The use of anthracyclines in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia is limited by associated cardiotoxic effects, which can result in cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure, and may be irreversible. Anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity in long-term survivors of childhood cancer is characterized by reduced left ventricular wall thickness and mass, which is indicative of decreased cardiac muscle and depressed left ventricular contractility which is indicative of unhealthy heart muscle. Risk factors for anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity include high cumulative anthracycline doses, high anthracycline dose intensity, and radiotherapy. Radiotherapy in patients with cancer treated with anthracyclines can exacerbate anthracycline-induced cardiac tissue damage. Several studies have shown that cardiomyopathy disease progression can be delayed in adults by using angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors such as enalapril. Studies in long-term survivors of pediatric cancer showed that enalapril has significant benefits in preventing cardiac functional deterioration on a short-term basis, but this is not sustained. Anthracycline-associated cardiotoxic effects can be combatted by preventing cardiac injury during chemotherapy administration. There is evidence that dexrazoxane significantly reduces the cardiotoxicity associated with anthracyclines such as daunorubicin, doxorubicin, and epirubicin in adult patients with a wide range of tumor types. A study of the efficacy of dexrazoxane in reducing doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in children and adolescents with high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia, showed that significantly fewer dexrazoxane-treated patients (21%) had elevated serum cardiac troponin (a biomarker of acute myocardial injury) levels than patients treated with chemotherapy alone (50%; P <.001). Dexrazoxane was also shown to have no effect on the event-free survival rate at 2.5 years, emphasizing that it does not detrimentally affect the efficacy of anthracycline therapy.", 
    "282": "It has been hypothesized that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition, independent from its effect on ventricular function and blood pressure, could affect the atherosclerotic process and reduce the incidence of ischemic events and its complications. Several large clinical outcome trials were designed to test this hypothesis: QUIET, HOPE, EUROPA, PEACE, and IMAGINE. The results of the PEACE study were recently reported, leaving the IMAGINE study as the last chapter in our efforts to evaluate the role of ACE inhibition in coronary artery disease with preserved left ventricular function. In this report, we compare these studies with respect to their methodology and patient population and analyze the unique nature of the last ongoing study, IMAGINE. The reported studies show that patients with coronary artery disease who are at low-to-moderate or high risk should receive an ACE inhibitor if tolerated. However, when the absolute risk of a patient decreases, and intensive contemporary management is given, with good control of risk factors, the absolute and perhaps relative benefits of an ACE inhibitor decrease and their routine use in these patients may not be warranted. The role of ACE inhibition started early post-coronary artery bypass graft in patients with preserved left ventricular function, and intensive contemporary management remains to be determined and should get answered by the IMAGINE study. Moreover, the IMAGINE population is not only a lower risk population than those enrolled in HOPE or EUROPA, but also the risk for this population is bimodal in nature (early post-revascularization inflammation and thrombosis vs long-term atherosclerosis progression) and may provide further insight into underlying mechanisms.", 
    "283": "Our aim was to investigate the changes in renal blood flow during brief exposure of the renal vasculature to angiotensin IV (Ang IV). Total renal blood flow was measured by electromagnetic flowmetry in pentobarbital-anesthetized male Sprague Dawley rats. Intrarenal injection of Ang I, Ang II and Ang III produced a dose-dependent vasoconstriction. In contrast, Ang IV and Ang-(3-10) produced a dose-dependent rapid vasoconstriction (lasting seconds) followed by a transient vasodilatation (lasting minutes). The biphasic response to Ang IV was unchanged in rats pre-treated with captopril, whereas the Ang-(3-10) response was abolished implying that its vasoactive activity was due to the generation of Ang IV. The vasodilatory component of Ang IV was unaffected by indomethacin. The biphasic vasoactive response of Ang IV was unaffected by divalinal-Ang IV (AT(4) receptor antagonist) or PD 123319 (AT(2) receptor antagonist), but greatly reduced by losartan or L-158,809 (AT(1) receptor antagonists). These results suggest that Ang IV is distinct from other angiotensins in that it possesses non-prostaglandin mediated renal vasodilatory activity that is apparently linked to the renal vascular AT(1) receptor.", 
    "284": "The quality of chronic kidney disease (CKD) care and the control of CKD progression factors and of comorbid conditions according to current recommendations in primary care were investigated in this retrospective cohort study of 127 consecutive CKD patients. CKD was advanced (glomerular filtration rate 21 +/- 10 ml/min). Fifty-seven per cent of patients had been evaluated to clarify CKD aetiology. Blood pressure was substantially elevated (148 +/- 20/83 +/- 11 mmHg) and only 39% of patients achieved target blood pressure levels. At a mean HbA(1c) of 6.5 +/- 1.1%, glycaemic control was good in 63% of diabetics. Mean haemoglobin was 10.8 +/- 1.8 g/dl, and anaemia was adequately controlled in 49%. In 42% the management of bone disease and in 80% the nutritional status was sufficient. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-2-receptor blockers was used in 59% of patients with diabetic nephropathy or proteinuria above 1 g/day. High-total quality of care was only achieved in 35% which suggests that the management of advanced CKD in primary care is suboptimal.", 
    "285": "Recent large hypertension trials have shown great differences in incidence of new-onset diabetes mellitus among patients receiving different antihypertensive drug therapies. The incidence of diabetes is unchanged or increased by the use of thiazide diuretics and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (beta-blockers) and unchanged or decreased by ACE inhibitors, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), and angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists (angiotensin receptor blockers). Recent results from ASCOT (Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial) showed superiority of the 'new' combination of CCBs and ACE inhibitors over the 'old' or 'conventional' combination of beta-blockers and diuretics. In this review, the results from some of the large hypertension trials are discussed, and the hypotheses on how different antihypertensive drug regimens can affect glucose homeostasis are considered. The question now is whether the results from these recent trials should affect the choice of antihypertensive treatment, particularly for special groups. However, the key goal is still to reduce BP, and this usually requires combinations of drugs.", 
    "286": "In the Hungarian population, there is also a growing number of patients with hypertension. In order to prevent the target organ's damage or in order to slow down the process, it is indispensable to reach the therapeutic target blood pressure. An opportunity for reducing the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. So far, we have had three large families, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers and aldosterone antagonists, to our disposal. The above are the key molecules for the hypertension treatment, but their application is accompanied by plasma renin level elevations, and thus, increase of plasma renin activation. The protection against increased plasma renin activation is helped by the renin inhibitors. Several decades were needed for their clinical introduction, till a non-peptide, safety medicament was successfully produced, which can be administered orally in small once-per-day doses. Their most promising representative is aliskiren. Still an open question is the mapping of the advantage of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blockers combination with aliskiren. The morbidity and mortality investigations are still missing and we curiously await them.", 
    "287": "The aim of this health economic modelling study was to investigate the effect of irbesartan combined with conventional antihypertensive medications compared to conventional antihypertensive therapy alone on the progression of nephropathy in patients with hypertension, type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria in a Swiss setting.", 
    "288": "In simulated patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes, treatment of microalbuminuria with irbesartan 300 mg daily plus conventional antihypertensive medications was compared to a control regimen (conventional medications excluding angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, other angiotensin-2-receptor antagonist and dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers). Progression from microalbuminuria to nephropathy, doubling of serum creatinine, ESRD, and all-cause mortality was simulated over a 25-year time horizon using a published Markov model adapted to a Swiss setting. Transition probabilities were based on the Irbesartan in Reduction of Microalbuminuria-2 Study, Irbesartan in Diabetic Nephropathy Trial and other sources. Costs and clinical outcomes were discounted at 5% annually according to Swiss guidelines, and a third party payer perspective was taken.", 
    "289": "Treatment with irbesartan was projected to improve mean life expectancy by 0.57 years compared to conventional antihypertension treatment (undiscounted 1.22 years). Irbesartan treatment was associated with cost savings of CHF 21,488 per patient over the 25-year time horizon. Sensitivity analysis showed that irbesartan therapy remained dominant to conventional antihypertension treatment over a range of plausible assumptions.",

    "291": "Nitric oxide (NO) is produced from amino acid L-arginine via the catalytic action of NO synthases, which use dioxygen and NADH or NADPH as cofactor. This simple molecule acts at nanomolar concentrations and demonstrates a wide spectrum of physiological effects, a primary of which is vasodilatation. The production of NO in endothelium cells is induced by mechanical action (increased blood-vessels wall tension) and chemical agents (catecholamines, acetylcholine, bradykinin, histamine). The endothelium-released NO easily diffuses to the underlying smooth muscles and triggers their relaxation by increasing cyclic guanosine monophosphate level and subsequent opening of endothelial potassium channels (K(ATP), K(Ca)). NO on the endothelium surface inhibits adhesion and aggregation of platelets, regulates the main functions of myocardium, modulates the permeability of endothelium, and weakens the interaction of endothelium cells and leukocytes by reducing the expression of adhesion-stimulating proteins. Direct evidence suggests that free radicals and related reactive oxygen species mostly as O2-, HO-, ONOO-, ROO- are associated with an endothelium dysfunction, which manifests itself as an impairment of endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation. Though reactive oxygen species in a small amount are produced constantly, the decreased metabolic turnover of homocysteine, poor performance of antioxidants or high level of angiotensin II alters the balance between production of free radicals and their neutralization. Such events decrease NO bioavailability and thus condition the development of various diseases like arteriosclerosis, hypertension, diabetes, heart and renal failure. Agents increasing NO bioavailability and depressing the endothelial dysfunction would be the most useful for the treatment above-mentioned pathologies.", 
    "292": "Left ventricular hypertrophy is considered to be a major cardiovascular risk factor in hemodialysis patients. Not only high blood pressure but also humoral factors such as angiotensin II and aldosterone are thought to contribute to the increase in left ventricular mass. We examined the effects of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, imidapril, on left ventricular mass in patients with end-stage renal diseases on maintenance hemodialysis. Thirty patients on chronic hemodialysis were randomly divided into 2 groups of 15 patients each and given placebo or 2.5 mg imidapril once daily for 6 months. Before and after the 6-month period, left ventricular mass was evaluated by echocardiography, and circulating factors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system were measured. Background characteristics such as age, gender ratio, causes of renal failure, duration of hemodialysis, body mass index and pre-dialysis blood pressure were comparable between the placebo and the imidapril groups. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were not significantly changed in either group during the study period. In the imidapril group, serum ACE was reduced (12 +/- 1 to 5 +/- 2 U/l, p < 0.01) and plasma renin activity was increased (3.3 +/- 0.8 to 8.1 +/- 3.2 ng/ml/h, p < 0.01), but plasma angiotensin II and aldosterone were not significantly changed after 6 months (13 +/- 3 to 17 +/- 3 pg/ml and 365 +/- 125 to 312 +/- 132 pg/ml, respectively). On the other hand, left ventricular mass index was significantly decreased in the imidapril group (132 +/- 10 to 109 +/- 6 g/m2, p < 0.05) but was unchanged in the placebo group (129 +/- 6 to 126 +/- 5 g/m2). These results suggest that an ACE inhibitor reduces left ventricular mass in hemodialysis patients by a mechanism that is independent of changes in blood pressure.", 
    "293": "There is increasing evidence that aldosterone exerts major adverse cardiovascular effects through classical mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) in nonepithelial tissues such as the brain and heart. This nonepithelial role of aldosterone has been underscored by the recent Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES) and the Eplerenone Post-AMI Heart Failure Efficacy and Survival Study (EPHESUS). These studies also showed that when using MR antagonist as an \"organ protecting\" drug, further organ protection could be derived by the addition of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker (ARB). The long-term effect of aldosterone was not inhibited in some subjects, so the possibility of organ damage due to so-called \"breakthrough\" aldosterone cannot be ignored. Nonepithelial MR-mediated effects played a major role in this aldosterone effect. These effects can be inhibited by MR antagonist at a small dose, not lower blood pressure. Therefore, the idea is now to combine a small dose of MR antagonist with an ACE inhibitor or ARB. However, warnings have been given recently due to the emergence of hyperkalemia and other adverse effects associated with inappropriate combination therapy. It is important to note that, if the eligibility criteria of RALES and EPHESUS are fulfilled, the potassium level will rarely become problematic. Therefore, the recent increase in the incidence of adverse effects can be attributed to the incorrect application of combination therapy. Elderly patients or those with dehydration, renal dysfunction, and aggravated heart failure require further close monitoring or termination of spironolactone administration. The combination of an MR antagonist and renin-angiotensin inhibitors should be a useful strategy if subjects are carefully selected, and carefully monitored. Adverse effects will occur only if the usage recommendations based on previous researches are not followed.",

    "295": "One hundred and eighty-one patients with idiopathic PAF were included in the study and randomly divided into three groups: group 1 (amiodarone group, n = 61) was treated with amiodarone alone, group 2 (amiodarone plus losartan, n = 59) was treated with amiodarone and perindopril in combination, and group 3 (amiodarone plus perindopril group, n = 61) was treated with amiodarone and perindopril in combination. The left atrial diameter (LAD) was measured with transthoracic echocardiogram at before and after 6, 12, 18 and 24-month of treatment. The duration of observation was up to two years and the primary end point of the study was the first recurrence of AF.", 
    "296": "During the 6 month following up, there was no difference in LAD among the three groups. After 12 months, LAD in group 1 was significantly larger than group 2 and group 3 (P < 0.05). At 7th-month, the sinus rhythm maintenance of group 1 was lower significantly than group 2 and group 3. At the end of the study, the maintenance of sinus rhythm in group 2 and group 3 was higher significantly than in group 1 (83.05% and 80.33% vs 59.01%, P < 0.05), nevertheless, there was no significant difference between group 2 and group 3.", 
    "297": "The results of this study suggest that the combination of amiodarone with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril or with angiotensin II receptor antagonist losartan are more effective than amiodarone alone in sinus rhythm maintenance for idiopathic PAF. ACEI and ARB can inhibit the enlargement of left atrium and reduce recurrence rate in patients with idiopathic PAF.", 
    "298": "Diabetes, which is frequently associated with hypertension, accelerates the development of hypertension-induced cardiovascular disease. Thus, the prevention of diabetes is important in the management of hypertension. Recent clinical megastudies have suggested that the blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) inhibits new onset of diabetes. Thus, the agents to inhibit the RAS should be beneficial for glucose metabolism. However, the cardiovascular protective effects of ACE inhibitors and ARBs are not always superior to other classes of drugs. Further long-term clinical trials are necessary to clarify the anti-diabetic effect of the RAS-inhibiting agents.", 
    "299": "Age-related arterial stiffness is more pronounced in diabetics compared to non-diabetics, which could explain the prevalence of isolated systolic hypertension (ISH, systolic blood pressure > or =140 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure <90 mmHg) being approximately twice that of the general population without diabetes. Large-scale interventional outcome trials have also shown that diabetics usually have higher pulse pressure and higher systolic blood pressure than non-diabetics. Advanced glycation end-product formation has been implicated in vascular and cardiac complications of diabetes including loss of arterial elasticity, suggesting possibilities for new therapeutic options. With increasing age, there is a shift to from diastolic to systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure as predictors of cardiovascular disease. This may affect drug treatment as different antihypertensive drugs may have differential effects on arterial stiffness that can be dissociated from their effects on blood pressure. While thiazide diuretics are associated with little or no change in arterial stiffness despite a robust antihypertensive effect, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers and calcium-channel blockers have been shown to reduce arterial stiffness. However, combination therapy is nearly always necessary to obtain adequate blood pressure control in diabetics. There are no randomized controlled trials looking specifically at treatment of ISH in diabetics. Recommendations regarding treatment of ISH in diabetes mellitus type 2 are based on extrapolation from studies in non-diabetics, post-hoc analyses and prespecified subgroup analysis in large-scale studies, and metaanalysis. These analyses have clearly demonstrated that blood pressure lowering in ISH confers improved prognosis and reduced cardiovascular and renal outcomes in both diabetics and non-diabetics.", 
    "300": "The accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGE) is a key factor in diabetic nephropathy (DN). Pyridoxamine inhibits AGE formation and protects against type I DN. Herein we tested: (1) whether C57BL6 db/db mice as a model of established type II DN resembled patients treated with drugs which inhibit angiotensin II action; (2) whether pyridoxamine was effective as a single therapy; and (3) whether pyridoxamine would add to the benefit of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (ACEi) by enalapril. In first set of experiments mice were treated with ACEi (benazepril) and an angiotensin II receptor blocker (valsartan) combination for 16 weeks after the onset of diabetes. In second group, mice with established DN were treated with pyridoxamine for 8 weeks. In a third set, mice with established DN were treated with pyridoxamine and enalapril combination for 16 weeks. Benazepril and valsartan combination partially prevented the development and progression of DN. Pyridoxamine treatment, as single therapy, decreased the progression of albuminuria and glomerular lesions. The combination of pyridoxamine with enalapril reduced both mortality and the progression of DN. In conclusion, (1) C57 BL6 db/db mice are a model of progressive type II DN; (2) The combination of pyridoxamine with enalapril decreased progression of type 2 DN and overall mortality. Thus, pyridoxamine could be a valuable adjunct to the current treatment of established type II DN.", 
    "301": "Reduction of nephrotic range albuminuria is associated with markedly improved renal and cardiovascular outcome in patients with diabetic nephropathy. Aldosterone has been suggested to play a role in the progression of diabetic nephropathy. We therefore aimed to evaluate the short-term effect of aldosterone antagonism with spironolactone on nephrotic range albuminuria and blood pressure in diabetic nephropathy. Twenty Caucasian patients with diabetic nephropathy and nephrotic range albuminuria (>2500 mg/24 h) despite recommended antihypertensive treatment completed this double-masked, randomized crossover trial. Patients were treated in random order with spironolactone 25 mg once daily and matched placebo for 2 months, on top of ongoing antihypertensive treatment, including an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker in maximally recommended doses. Median (range) number of antihypertensive drugs was 3 (2-5). After each treatment period, albuminuria, 24-h ambulatory blood pressure, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were determined. Spironolactone on top of recommended renoprotective treatment induced a 32% (95% confidence interval (CI): 21-42%) reduction in albuminuria from (geometric mean (95% CI)) 3718 (2910-4749) mg/24 h on placebo treatment (P<0.001). There was a significant reduction in 24-h blood pressure of 6 (2-10)/4 (2-6) mm Hg and day blood pressure of 7 (3-12)/5 (3-7) mm Hg (P<0.01), whereas night blood pressure remained unchanged. Spironolactone induced an insignificant reversible reduction in GFR of 3 ml/min/1.73 m2 from 64 (27) ml/min/1.73 m2. No patients were excluded due to adverse events. Our results suggest that spironolactone treatment on top of recommended renoprotective treatment including maximal renin-angiotensin system blockade may offer additional renoprotection in patients with diabetic nephropathy and nephrotic range albuminuria.", 
    "302": "The aim of this study was to determine if myocardial inflammation is increased after myocardial ischemia and whether angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, or diuretics decrease mediators of inflammation in rats with induced myocardial ischemia. Changes in cardiac interstitial fluid (CIF) levels of nitric oxide metabolites (NOX), cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP), angiotensin II (Ang II), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were monitored with/without oral administration of benazepril, amlodipine, combined benazepril-amlodipine, or hydrochlorothiazide. Using a microdialysis technique, levels of several mediators of inflammation were measured after sham operation or 30-minute occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Compared with sham animals, levels of CIF NOX and cGMP were decreased in animals with ischemia (P < 0.001). Benazepril or amlodipine significantly increased NOX levels (P < 0.05 vs. untreated ischemia), but only benazepril significantly increased cGMP (P < 0.05). Combined benazepril-amlodipine further increased CIF NOX and cGMP (P < 0.001), compared with either drug alone. CIF Ang II and TNF-alpha in sham animals did not change significantly. In animals with ischemia, CIF Ang II and TNF-alpha increased progressively. Amlodipine alone, benazepril alone, or combined benazepril-amlodipine significantly reduced TNF-alpha (P < 0.01 for monotherapies and P < 0.001 for combination therapy). Hydrochlorothiazide did not cause significant changes in NOX, cGMP, or TNF-alpha. Combination benazepril-amlodipine may be beneficial for managing cardiac ischemia.", 
    "303": "HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) is now the third leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in African Americans between the ages of 20 and 64 years. Statistics in the United States estimate the incidence of HIVAN to be between 3.5% and 12%. The estimated number of those living with HIV worldwide is 37.4 million, with 26 million in Africa. If the US data for HIVAN were extrapolated to Africa, between 0.9 and 3.1 million people would be predicted to have HIVAN. These figures predict an unprecedented (and possibly underestimated) burden of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in Africa, especially if we take into account the socioeconomic associations with CKD for the African continent. This potentially large number of patients poses daunting logistic, financial, and ethical issues for physicians and nephrologists practicing in Africa. Preventing chronic kidney disease due to HIV in Africa should become a major priority. This would enable early detection and treatment of HIVAN in order to prevent or delay progression to ESRD. As HIV infection is a risk factor for the development of CKD, the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends screening for CKD in HIV-infected patients; screening tests should be similar to those for patients with diabetes mellitus to detect early renal involvement. Preventive strategies need to be determined; prospective studies including antiretroviral therapy, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and other therapeutic agents are required.", 
    "304": "We aimed to test if fosinopril reduces urinary protein excretion and alleviates renal tubular damage in normotensive children with steroid-resistant idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (SRINS). We also aimed to evaluate whether there are changes in steady-state blood pressure and serum concentrations of serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and plasma renin activity or angiotensin II (AT-II) in children under this treatment. Forty-five normotensive patients with SRINS were randomly divided into two groups. Group I was treated with fosinopril and prednisone for 12 weeks, while group II was treated with prednisone alone for the same duration. The values of 24-h urinary protein excretion were 1.25+/-0.64 vs 2.52+/-0.56 g/24 h (P<0.05), 1.16+/-0.45 vs 2.42+/-0.24 g/24 h (P<0.05), and 1.10+/-0.41 vs 2.05+/-0.46 g/24 h (P<0.05) in group I and group II patients, respectively, at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. Patients in group I showed lower serum concentrations of urinary retinol-binding protein and beta(2)-microglobulin (P<0.01) at the end of the study, but the patients' blood pressure and components of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) had no change during treatment. The result suggested that fosinopril significantly reduced proteinuria and alleviated renal tubular damage, but did not influence blood pressure and components of systemic RAS in normotensive children with SRINS.",

We determined the extent to which patients with diabetes and SMI, relative to diabetes patients without SMI, met American Diabetes Association goals for cholesterol and blood pressure, met criteria for the metabolic syndrome, and were prescribed medications known to reduce cardiovascular events. We found that less than half of diabetes patients, both with and without SMI, met recommended goals for cholesterol levels; even fewer had adequate blood pressure control. In addition, a substantial proportion of all diabetes patients met metabolic syndrome criteria. However, diabetes patients with SMI were less likely to be prescribed cholesterol-lowering statin medications, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blocking agents than diabetes patients without SMI. Patients with both diabetes and SMI are treated less aggressively for high cardiovascular risk than diabetes patients without mental disorders.",

    "310": "Bradykinin 1-5 is a major stable metabolite of bradykinin, formed by the proteolytic action of angiotensin-converting enzyme. In vitro and animal studies suggest that bradykinin 1-5 possesses biological activity. This study tests the hypothesis that bradykinin 1-5 affects vasodilation, fibrinolysis, or platelet aggregation in humans. Graded doses of bradykinin (47-377 pmol/min) and bradykinin 1-5 (47-18,850 pmol/min) were infused in the brachial artery in random order in 36 healthy subjects. Forearm blood flow (FBF) was measured, and simultaneously obtained venous and arterial plasma samples were analyzed for tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) antigen. In seven subjects each, alpha- and gamma-thrombin-induced platelet aggregation was measured in platelet-rich plasma obtained from antecubital venous blood at baseline and during peptide infusions. Bradykinin caused dose-dependent increases in FBF and net t-PA release (P < 0.001 for both). Bradykinin 1-5 did not affect FBF (P = 0.13) or net t-PA release (P = 0.46) at concentrations >1500 times physiologic. In contrast, both bradykinin and bradykinin 1-5 inhibited alpha-and gamma-thrombin-induced platelet aggregation (P < 0.01 versus baseline). Bradykinin 1-5 inhibited gamma-thrombin-induced platelet aggregation 50% at a calculated dose of 183 +/- 3 pmol/min. Neither bradykinin nor bradykinin 1-5 affected thrombin receptor-activating peptide-induced platelet aggregation, consistent with the hypothesis that bradykinin and bradykinin 1-5 inhibit thrombin-induced platelet aggregation by preventing cleavage of the thrombin receptor and liberation of thrombin receptor-activating peptide. This study is the first to demonstrate biological activity of bradykinin 1-5 following in vivo administration to humans. By inhibiting thrombin-induced platelet aggregation without causing vasodilation, bradykinin 1-5 may provide a model for small molecule substrate-selective thrombin inhibitors.",

    "315": "It has been postulated that hypertension and interdialytic weight gain in hemodialysis patients are related to the activation of the renin-angiotensin system. Angiotensin II type 1 (ATI) receptor antagonists are new anti-hypertensive agents and are currently the most specific means of blocking the renin-angiotensin enzymatic cascade. Recent studies show that candesartan cilexetil regulates thirst and hypertension in rodents, via cerebral AT1 receptor blockade. We therefore conducted a prospective open study of candesartan cilexetil in 21 hypertensive patients on long-term hemodialysis during 6 weeks, focusing on thirst regulation. We also performed a prospective follow-up study of tolerance of candesartan and its anti-hypertensive efficacy after this 6-week study, while the patients remained on this therapy. Weight gain between hemodialysis sessions did not differ between the periods before and during candesartan cilexetil therapy. Median absolute interdialytic weight gain was 2.35 kg (range: 0.55-5) before therapy, compared to 2.25 kg (range: 0.35-4.65) during therapy (p > 0.05, Wilcoxon test). The median interdialytic weight gain/dry weight index was 3.7% (range: 1.15-7) before therapy and 3.6% (range: 0.7-6.6) during candesartan therapy (p > 0.05, Wilcoxon test). The median dose of candesartan cilexetil was 12 mg/day (range: 4-24). The median total duration of therapy with candesartan (including the 6 weeks of the thirst study) was 12 months (range: 2-25). During candesartan cilexetil therapy, the number of concomitant anti-hypertensive drugs per patient fell significantly (median number of anti-hypertensive drugs before candesartan =2 (range: 1-6); during candesartan =1 (range: 1-5) (p < 0.02, Wilcoxon test). No anaphylactoid reactions occurred. A total of 161 episodes of hypotension (5%) occurred during 3074 hemodialysis sessions (including the 6 weeks of the thirst study) We conclude that, like angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and the other angiotensin receptor antagonists, candesartan cilexetil is unable to reduce interdialytic weight gain in hemodialysis patients. This study also shows that the irreversible angiotensin II receptor antagonist candesartan cilexetil is a safe and effective therapeutic option for hypertensive hemodialysis patients.", 
    "316": "Type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic vascular disease develop in parallel. Prospective epidemiologic studies have shown a striking communality of major risk factors for both diseases. This raises the question of a \"common soil\". The traits of the metabolic syndrome including dyslipidemia, visceral obesity and hypertension are predictors of type 2 diabetes as well as coronary heart disease. The same applies to the environmental factors: overnutrition, physical inertia and smoking. Visceral obesity, insulin resistance and low-grade inflammation are known as major components of the common soil for metabolic syndrome and coronary heart disease. Depending on the quality of metabolic control diabetes will accelerate the progression of atherosclerosis via unstable plaque formation. The \"common soil\" concept provides a paradigm for an integrated therapeutic approach. This applies to a lifestyle intervention as well as a rational use of drugs in diseases of the metabolic syndrome. The medication should consider coexisting disorders of the metabolic syndrome to use pleiotropic effects. On the other hand, side effect such as the worsening of blood glucose levels caused by beta-blockers and diuretics should be avoided. The following medication should be preferred in context of the metabolic syndrome: oral antidiabetics such as acarbose, metformin and thiazolidinediones, antihypertensives such as ACE inhibitors and ARBs (angiotensin receptor blockers) and lipid-lowering drugs such as atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, and the modern nicotinic acid derivative Niaspan, respectively. The strategy using synergies in drug treatment can reduce polypharmacy and costs and improve the patients' compliance.", 
    "317": "1. The potential cardioprotective effect of ACE inhibitors has been attributed to the inhibition of bradykinin degradation. Recent data in rats documented a kallidin-like peptide, which mimics the cardioprotective effect of ischaemic preconditioning. This study investigates in isolated Langendorff rat heart the effect of the ACE inhibitor captopril, the role of bradykinin, kallidin-like peptide, and nitric oxide (NO). 2. The bradykinin level in the effluent of the control group was 14.6 pg ml(-1) and was not affected by captopril in the presence or absence of kinin B2-receptor antagonist, HOE140. 3. The kallidin-like peptide levels were approximately six-fold higher (89.8 pg ml(-1)) and increased significantly by treatment with captopril (144 pg ml(-1)), and simultaneous treatment with captopril and HOE140 (197 pg ml(-1)). 4. Following 30 min ischaemia in the control group, the creatine kinase activity increased from 0.4 to 53.4 U l(-1). In the captopril group and in the captopril+L-NAME group, the creatine kinase activity was significantly lower (18.5 and 22.8 U l(-1)). This beneficial effect of captopril was completely abolished by the kinin B2-receptor antagonist, HOE140, as well as by the kallidin antiserum. 5. Perfusion of the hearts with kallidin before the 30 min ischaemia, but not with bradykinin, yielded an approximately 50% reduction in creatine kinase activity after reperfusion. 6. Pretreatment with L-NAME alone and simultaneously with captopril, and with kallidin, respectively, suggests a kinin-independent action of NO before the 30 min ischaemia on coronary flow and a kinin-dependent action after ischaemia. 7. These data show that captopril increases kallidin-like peptide in the effluent. Kallidin-like peptide via kinin B2 receptor seems to be the physiological mediator of cardioprotective actions of captopril against ischaemic reperfusion injury. HOE140 as well as the kallidin antiserum abolished the cardioprotective effects of captopril.", 
    "318": "The Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) published its main findings in December, 2002. It recommended thiazide diuretics as a first-line treatment of hypertension. The current study describes the prescribing patterns of thiazide diuretics in four regions of Kaiser Permanente, a large national United States Health Maintenance Organization--two regions that had an ALLHAT clinical center and two that did not. We tested the hypothesis that participation in a clinical trial leads to quicker and greater adoption of study recommendations than non-participation in a trial. The relative percentage of filled outpatient prescriptions for the period 2 or 3 years before the ALLHAT main publication through December 31, 2004 was calculated by region for thiazide-type diuretics and for calcium channel blockers (CCBs), beta-blockers, central alpha-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and other antihypertensive diuretics. In the 2 years after publication of the ALLHAT trial findings, the percentage of all prescriptions for thiazide diuretics increased from 11.2% to 12.4% in the two regions with an ALLHAT clinical site and from 8.9% to 10.1% in the two regions without an ALLHAT clinical site (p > 0.05). The percentage of new prescriptions for thiazide diuretics increased from 13.7% to 16.6% in the two regions with an ALLHAT clinical site and from 10.8% to 13.0% in the two regions without an ALLHAT clinical site (p > 0.05).

    "319": "Angiotensin II is a key mediator in the mechanism of hypertension and plays a pathophysiological role for the development of ischemic stroke. Activation of AT1 receptors by angiotensin II initiates a complex signaling cascade via in part reactive oxygen species produced by the enzyme NADPH oxidase in blood vessels and induces vasoconstriction, vascular proliferation, and inflammation leading to cerebrovascular insufficiency. On the other hand, AT2 receptors are potentially protective. Recently, many clinical trials showed inhibition of renin-angiotensin system(AT1 receptor blockers and ACE inhibitors) has beneficial effect on stroke prevention independent of blood pressure lowering. Inhibition of renin-angiotensin system is a new promising strategy for stroke prevention.", 
    "320": "Based on the RALES study, in patients with moderate to severe chronic heart failure and reduced left ventricular function, the nonselective aldosterone antagonist spironolactone has a well-established role in combination with ACE inhibition, beta-blockade and diuretics. This indication was recently reinforced by the guideline for chronic heart failure therapy of the German Cardiac Society, although there is no formal approval for spironolactone for this indication in Germany.", 
    "321": "Heart failure after acute myocardial infarction represents a new indication for aldosterone receptor blockade. In the EPHESUS trial of patients with acute myocardial infarction, reduced ejection fraction, and clinical signs of heart failure, the selective aldosterone antagonist eplerenone in combination with ACE inhibition and beta-blockade significantly reduced mortality. The best benefit was achieved by early treatment, i. e., starting 3-7 days post myocardial infarction. In addition, as early as after 30 days, eplerenone-treated patients had significantly reduced mortality and hospitalization. Eplerenone was approved for the indication heart failure after acute myocardial infarction in late 2004 in Germany.", 
    "322": "The present review summarizes the pathophysiological basis, the experimental and clinical trials that constitute the rationale for therapy with aldosterone antagonists in patients with acute myocardial infarction and heart failure. Tips for use in clinical practice are given which allow to profit from the effective potential for mortality and morbidity reduction of aldosterone receptor blockade and to minimize the risk of serious hyperkalemia.", 
    "323": "Determination of microalbuminuria has been shown to be useful to identify patients with type 2 diabetes (DM2) at high risk of renal and cardiovascular (CV) diseases. The determination of the albumin/creatinine (Cr) ratio in an isolate sample of urine has been shown to be sufficient for the diagnosis as well as for the evaluation of the efficacy of the therapy employed to reduce microalbuminuria. Values of urinary albumin >30 mg/g of Cr or 3,4 mg/mmol of Cr are evidence of microalbuminuria. This condition is frequently associated with high blood pressure levels, which increases dramatically not only the progression of renal disease but also de risk of a CV event. Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that the presence of microalbuminuria is predictive of higher morbi-mortality independent of the presence of other CV risk factors. It appears to reflect a generalized vascular lesion not confined to the glomeruli. The capacity of reducing blood pressure, intraglomerular pressure and the permeability of the glomerular membrane, which are important factors in the progression of renal disease, may explain the renoprotective effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and the angiotensin II receptors blockers (ARBs). In the treatment of diabetic nephropathy, the control of blood pressure, which has to be maintained near or below 130/80 mmHg associated to the blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with ACEIs or BRAs are the best strategies to promote renal and CV protection.", 
    "324": "We investigated whether long-term treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor imidapril or the calcium channel antagonist nifedipine increases systemic nitric oxide (NO) production in patients with essential hypertension. Twenty-nine patients with essential hypertension were randomly divided into two groups, and they were treated with either imidapril or nifedipine once daily p.o. for 4 weeks. Long-term treatment with imidapril significantly decreased blood pressure and increased plasma NOx concentration. Long-term treatment with nifedipine also caused a comparable extent of significant decrease in blood pressure, but failed to alter plasma NOx levels. The imidapril treatment significantly inhibited serum ACE activity and increased plasma bradykinin concentration. Furthermore, the extent of inhibition of serum ACE activity and the extent of increase in plasma bradykinin concentration in response to the imidapril treatment were both significantly correlated with the extent of increase in plasma NOx concentration. In contrast, no such changes were noted after the nifedipine treatment. These results provide the first evidence that long-term treatment with imidapril enhances plasma NOx concentration in patients with essential hypertension. This effect does not seem to be due to the decrease in blood pressure. The increase in bradykinin concentration may be involved in the enhancing effect of the ACE inhibitor on NOx production in vivo.", 
    "325": "The generation of the Lew.Tg(mRen2) congenic hypertensive rat strain, developed through a backcross of the hypertensive (mRen2)27 transgenic rat with normotensive Lewis rats, provides a new model by which primary hypertension can be studied without the genetic variability found in the original strain. The purpose of this study was to characterize the Lew.Tg(mRen2) rats by dually investigating the effects of type 1 angiotensin II (ANG II) receptor (AT(1)) blockade and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity inhibition on the ANG-(1-7)/ACE2 axis of the renin-angiotensin system in this new hypertensive model. The control of blood pressure elicited by 12-day administration of either lisinopril (mean difference change = 92 +/- 2, P < 0.05) or losartan (mean difference change = 69 +/- 2, P < 0.05) was associated with 54% and 33% increases in cardiac ACE2 mRNA and 54% and 43% increases in cardiac ACE mRNA, respectively. Lisinopril induced a 3.1-fold (P < 0.05) increase in renal cortical expression of ACE2, whereas losartan increased ACE2 mRNA 3.5-fold (P < 0.05). Both treatment regimens increased renal ACE mRNA 2.6-fold (P < 0.05). The two therapies augmented ACE2 protein activity, as well as increased cardiac and renal AT(1) receptor mRNAs. ACE inhibition reduced plasma ANG II levels (81%, P < 0.05) and increased plasma ANG-(1-7) (265%, P < 0.05), whereas losartan had no effect on the peptides. In contrast with what had been shown in normotensive rats, ACE inhibition decreased renal ANG II excretion and transiently decreased ANG-(1-7) excretion, whereas losartan treatment was associated with a consistent decrease in ANG-(1-7) urinary excretion rates. In response to the treatments, the expression of both renal cortical renin and angiotensinogen mRNAs was significantly augmented. The paradoxical effects of blockade of ANG II synthesis and activity on urinary excretion rates of the peptides and plasma angiotensins levels suggest that, in Lew.Tg(mRen2) congenic rats, a failure of compensatory ACE2 and ANG-(1-7)-dependent vasodepressor mechanisms may contribute both to the development and progression of hypertension driven by increased formation of endogenous ANG II.", 
    "326": "Hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) are major cardiovascular risk factors, and often cluster in the same individual in the context of the metabolic syndrome. Management of hypertension in the diabetic patient is extremely important, and agents from all major antihypertensive classes are effective towards this goal. Conventional beta-blockers are associated with detrimental effects on insulin sensitivity, glycaemic control, and the incidence of type 2 DM and thus are less often used in hypertensive patients with DM. In contrast, the newer vasodilating beta-blockers appear to be free of adverse effects on the above metabolic parameters, and could be a valuable tool for hypertension treatment in patients with DM or the metabolic syndrome. This review summarizes the evidence on the effects of antihypertensive treatment with both traditional and vasodilating beta-blockers on parameters related to carbohydrate metabolism, and discuss the pathophysiological mechanisms that may be responsible.", 
    "327": "Various mechanisms have been argued for skin wrinkling, one of the hallmarks of aging. We hypothesize that chronic sympathetic bias is a previously unrecognized mechanism for wrinkling. In the acute setting of water immersion, reversible skin wrinkling is a well-known reflex mediated by the autonomic nervous system. We postulate that skin wrinkling results as a local maladaptive manifestation of a global chronic sympathetic bias that emerges during aging. The persistence of such changes may induce additional compensatory remodeling to cause permanent alteration of the skin. Sympatholytic agents may prove beneficial for arresting or ameliorating the development of wrinkles. Conditions that amplify sympathetic bias such as stress, smoking, amphetamine abuse, HIV, heart failure, and transplantation may accelerate wrinkling. Other common diseases of the skin may also arise as particular manifestations of aberrant autonomic activity through induction of vascular and immune dysfunctions. The temporal and spatial distribution of these dermatologic conditions may reflect variation of autonomic balance, which also regulates T helper immune balance. For all of these dermatologic conditions, local and systemic administration of drugs and medical devices that pharmacologically or electrically modulate autonomic nervous system activity may yield benefits as well.", 
    "328": "In this study, the interaction of the anion of quinapril (QUIN), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, with cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) was investigated. The effect of cationic micelles on the spectroscopic and acid-base properties of QUIN was studied at pH 8. The binding of QUIN anion to CTAB micelles implied a shift in drug acidity constant (pK(a)(water)-pK(a)(micelle)=1.39) proving the great affinity of negatively charged QUIN ion for the positively charged CTAB micelle surface. The strong dependence of the partition coefficient K(x) on QUIN concentration, obtained by using pseudo-phase model, is consistent with an adsorption-like phenomenon. From the dependence of differential absorbance at lambda=272 nm on CTAB concentration, by using mathematical model that treats the solubilization of QUIN anion as its binding to specific sites in the micelles (Langmuir adsorption isotherm), the binding constant K(b)=(2.3+/-0.4)x10(3) mol(-1)dm(3) was obtained. QUIN-CTAB binding constant was also calculated from micellar liquid chromatography (MLC) and this method was found to be not accurate enough for its determination.", 
    "329": "The presence of unknown impurity of the order of 0.2% was identified in benazepril using liquid chromatographic technique employing binary gradient system comprising acetic acid and ammonia in water and acetonitrile as the mobile phase. LCMS data corresponds to hydroxylated benazepril (OHB) derivative possessing the molecular formula C(24)H(28)N(2)O(6). This impurity was isolated using isocratic system containing ammonium acetate and acetonitrile and the product was characterized using FT-IR, (1)H and (13)C NMR and mass spectroscopy to ascertain the structure of the impurity. The spectroscopic analysis revealed the presence of hydroxyl function on C(17) carbon atom of benazepril molecule. The plausible mechanism for the formation of OHB species is proposed.",

After 6 weeks of treatment, the reductions in diastolic blood pressure were significantly greater in patients carrying the TT or CT genotype compared with those carrying the CC genotype (9.1+/-7.0 mm Hg or 8.9+/-7.0 mm Hg versus 5.1+/-7.3 mm Hg, respectively; P=.001, ANOVA). Regarding the A6547G polymorphism, we observed the AA genotype in 19 patients (3.7%), the AG genotype in 184 (36.2%), and the GG genotype in 306 (60.1%). There were no significant differences in the blood pressure reductions after treatment among the 3 genotype groups, and there was no interaction between it and the -344C/T polymorphism. Stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that the significant predictors of diastolic blood pressure reduction at 6 weeks were baseline diastolic blood pressure (P<.001), -344C/T genotype (P=.007), and sex (P=.033).",

We evaluated 45,744 patients with NSTE ACS (positive cardiac markers and/or ischemic ST-segment changes) who were treated at 424 hospitals in the CRUSADE Quality Improvement Initiative between March 2000 and March 2003. Treatment patterns and in-hospital outcomes in patients with signs of CHF on presentation and those who developed in-hospital CHF were compared with those in patients without CHF. In total, 10,398 patients (22.7%) had signs of CHF on presentation, and 1,664 patients (3.6%) later developed in-hospital CHF. Compared with patients without CHF, early (<24 hours from presentation) medications and invasive cardiac procedures were used less often in patients with signs of CHF on presentation. Likewise, patients with in-hospital CHF were less likely than those without CHF to receive acute antiplatelet agents and undergo cardiac catheterization but more likely to receive acute beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and heparin and to undergo coronary artery bypass grafting. Adjusted mortality was higher in patients with signs of CHF on presentation (odds ratio 2.64, 95% confidence interval 2.31 to 3.01) and those with in-hospital CHF (odds ratio 4.93, 95% confidence interval 4.05 to 5.99) than in patients without CHF. In conclusion, CHF occurs frequently in patients with NSTE ACS but is associated with less aggressive treatment and a higher risk of mortality. Further study is needed to determine the causes of these treatment differences and the optimal therapeutic approach for patients with NSTE ACS and concomitant CHF.",

The patients were followed for about 5.5 years. The doses chosen for this trial were biased in favour of amlodipine, in terms of expected effects on blood pressure, cardiovascular mortality and strokes. However, amlodipine was not associated with a reduction in overall mortality or with a lower frequency of the primary outcome (non fatal myocardial infarction or coronary death). (2) In practice, the best first-line treatment for preventing the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality associated with hypertension remains a diuretic (chlortalidone or hydrochlorothiazide).", 
    "336": "To develop angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory chitin derivatives based on the properties of ACE inhibitors, chitins with different degree of deacetylation were chemically modified by grafting 2-chloroethylamino hydrochloride onto chitin at the C-6 position. Three kinds of chitin derivatives were prepared and designated as aminoethyl-chitin (AEC) with 10% degree of deacetylation, aminoethyl-chitin with 50% degree of deacetylation (AEC50), and aminoethyl-chitin with 90% degree of deacetylation (AEC90). IC50 values of three chitin derivatives on ACE were 0.064 microM (AEC), 0.038 microM (AEC50), and 0.103 microM (AEC90). The results of Dixon plots revealed that AEC50 was a competitive inhibitor, and the inhibition constant (Ki) value was 0.021 microM. In addition, the antihypertensive effect of AEC50 on spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) was evaluated, and the result showed that it effectively decreased systolic blood pressure (SBP) in a dose-dependent manner.",

There is general consensus that hydration protocols implemented before and after imaging with contrast medium may be effective in preventing contrast medium-induced nephropathy. However, definitive and convincing data related to amounts to be infused, infusion timing, and type of solutions (half-isotonic, isotonic saline solution, or bicarbonate) are lacking. Forced diuresis with furosemide or mannitol and use of dopamine, together with concomitant hydration, have been proved to be ineffective or even more risky in the event of inadequate maintenance of euvolemia. Various direct or indirect vasodilators have been investigated (atrial natriuretic peptide, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and endothelin receptor antagonists), yet results have been inconsistent and inconclusive. Recent large meta-analyses concerning the protective role of antioxidant action of N-acetylcysteine have led to the conclusion that the statistical significance of the results is borderline.

Seven transgenic lines developed dilated cardiomyopathy and premature death from congestive heart failure. One founder line that survived long enough to propagate had extremely high-level Cre recombinase expression. Transgenic lines that expressed low levels remained healthy. The high-expressing strain developed heart failure over a very predictable and reproducible time course. Detailed examination of the high-expressing strain revealed important molecular, cellular, and pharmacologic hallmarks of cardiomyopathy. First, \"fetal genes\" such as atrial natriuretic factor and brain natriuretic protein were expressed, a marker of pathologic cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. Second, an increased incidence of cardiac myocyte apoptosis was present. Third, treatment of mice with captopril or metoprolol, drugs that delay the progression of heart failure, improved survival.",

However, these two classes of agents do interfere in different stages of the renin-angiotensin system. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, advantages for ARBs over conventional (non-ACE inhibitor) therapy on progression from micro- to macroalbuminuria and overt nephropathy and end-stage renal disease have been shown in clinical trials. In patients with type 2 diabetes and end-stage renal disease, the need for dialysis and/or transplantation results in the use of major healthcare resources. This paper reviews the available economic evidence on treatment with ARBs in type 2 diabetic patients with advanced renal disease.Within-trial analytic and Markov model economic evaluations of the RENAAL (Reduction of Endpoint in Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus with Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan), IDNT (Irbesartan Diabetic Nephropathy Trial) and IRMA (IRbesartan in type 2 diabetes with MicroAlbuminuria)-2 studies suggest that treatment with ARBs in patients with type 2 diabetes with overt or incipient nephropathy confers health gains and net cost savings compared with conventional (non-ACE inhibitor) therapy. For reimbursement and reference pricing decisions, there is a need for a head-to-head comparison of an ACE inhibitor with ARBs to model all possible costs and effects of ACE inhibitors and ARBs.

Furthermore, a genotype-phenotype interaction analysis in the normoalbuminuric patients revealed no differences in sex distribution, age, duration of diabetes, blood pressure, HbA(1c,) or urinary albumin excretion rate across genotypes. In the observational follow-up study, the rate of decline in GFR did not differ between groups of patients with different -344T/C genotype (P = 0.41).

The analysis included a subset of 44 patients who participated in both trials and were not receiving epoetin in the period (median, 12 months; range 5-15) between the trials due to epoetin shortage. Two co-primary outcomes were average weekly hemoglobin difference from the baseline and average weekly epoetin dose.",

Average weekly epoetin dose of 107 IU/kg in T2 was higher than 96 IU/kg in T1 (ratio, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.04-1.24; P=0.009). With additional adjustment for within-subject changes in baseline covariates from T1 to T2 (baseline hemoglobin, body mass index, serum albumin, ferritin and transferrin saturation, intact parathormone, C-reactive protein, dialysis dose, and use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors), hemoglobin response remained lower (adjusted difference, -0.44 g/dL; 95% CI, -0.73 to -0.16; P=0.004) and weekly epoetin dose remained higher in T2 than inT1 (adjusted ratio, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.03-1.34; P=0.016).", 
    "370": "In patients with ESRD, responsiveness to epoetin was lower in T2 after a period of epoetin therapy discontinuation than in T1 epoetin trial. Since this could not be explained by within-subject changes in factors known to affect response to epoetin, a prolonged withdrawal of epoetin in patients with ESRD might independently contribute to a reduced responsiveness to epoetin at a later re-exposure.",

    "372": "Diabetic patients are often treated with a lipid lowering statin and an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor antagonist against hypertension or albuminuria. These drugs may also improve glucose tolerance, but the mechanism for this remains elusive. We now studied whether these drugs and the fatty acid palmitate influence insulin secretion in vivo in rats through effects on islet blood perfusion. Whole pancreatic blood flow was markedly increased by captopril and irbesartan, and decreased by palmitate. Islet blood flow was significantly and preferentially enhanced by captopril, irbesartan, and pravastatin, and suppressed by palmitate. Both captopril and irbesartan raised serum insulin concentrations significantly. However, glycemia was not affected in any group. In conclusion, the present study suggests that a local pancreatic RAS and pravastatin may be selectively controlling pancreatic islet blood flow and thereby influencing insulin secretion. The antidiabetic actions of statins and RAS inhibitors might in part occur through the beneficial direct islet effects shown here. Conversely, free fatty acids that are elevated in type 2 diabetic patients may contribute to an impaired nutritive islet blood flow and thereby further aggravate the diabetic state by limiting the supply of insulin needed to curb hyperglycemia.",

The groups were comparable in age, sex, AH duration, as well as office systolic and diastolic arterial pressure. The study demonstrated comparable hypotensive effects of both pharmaceuticals, although moxonidine had an effect on target organs (left ventricular myocardial hypertrophy).

Treatment thresholds and targets should take into account each individual's global atherosclerotic risk, target organ damage and comorbid conditions. BP should be lowered to less than 140/90 mmHg in all patients, and to less than 130/80 mmHg in those with diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease (regardless of the degree of proteinuria). Most adults with hypertension require more than one agent to achieve these target BPs. For adults without compelling indications for other agents, initial therapy should include thiazide diuretics. Other agents appropriate for first-line therapy for diastolic hypertension with or without systolic hypertension include beta-blockers (in those younger than 60 years), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (in nonblack patients), long-acting calcium channel blockers or angiotensin receptor antagonists. Other agents for first-line therapy for isolated systolic hypertension include long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers or angiotensin receptor antagonists. Certain comorbid conditions provide compelling indications for first-line use of other agents: in patients with angina, recent myocardial infarction or heart failure, beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors are recommended as first-line therapy; in patients with diabetes mellitus, ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor antagonists (or in patients without albuminuria, thiazides or dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers) are appropriate first-line therapies; and in patients with nondiabetic chronic kidney disease, ACE inhibitors are recommended. All hypertensive patients should have their fasting lipids screened, and those with dyslipidemia should be treated using the thresholds, targets and agents recommended by the Canadian Hypertension Education Program Working Group on the management of dyslipidemia and the prevention of cardiovascular disease.

These new recommendations still need to be incorporated into what remain as the older but still important considerations for the diagnosis, management and treatment of the patient with hypertension, namely, to assess blood pressure in all adults at all appropriate visits, to expedite the diagnosis of hypertension, to assess and manage global cardiovascular risk, to emphasize that lifestyle modifications are the cornerstone of antihypertensive therapy, to treat to target, and to use combinations of antihypertensive medications and lifestyles to achieve recommended targets.

Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors improve mortality and morbidity in systolic heart failure. However, the risk/benefit relationship of angiotensin-converting-enzyme therapy in the elderly has not been adequately determined. Angiotensin II receptor blockers improve morbidity in elderly and non-elderly chronic heart-failure patients; however, data are limited regarding mortality in these patients. Aldosterone receptor antagonists provide significant mortality benefit to elderly chronic heart-failure patients. Digoxin is beneficial as an additive therapy in the treatment of systolic heart failure regardless of advanced age.", 
    "392": "Agents that provide substantive clinical benefit overall also appear to do so in the elderly, based on subgroup analysis of major trials. There have been very few prospective, placebo-controlled trials specifically in elderly heart-failure patients.

There are ten completed prospective clinical trials with atrial fibrillation as a secondary endpoint or assessed in post-hoc analysis. Five of these studies have reported a positive impact of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers on atrial fibrillation burden.

The purported superiority of specific drug classes, notably angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers, is increasingly debated. Conversely, the benefits of calcium channel blockers are increasingly recognized. Irrespective of differences, all three agents are frequently required to achieve blood pressure targets. Beyond blood pressure reduction, statin therapy is undoubtedly the single most important risk factor intervention. New studies suggest that intensive lipid lowering and greater reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol will further reduce major cardiovascular events. Finally, the impact of smoking cessation, exercise, and diet is often underestimated.",

Over the past several years, a number of trials have tested the hypothesis that an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) could be as effective as, or more effective than, ACE inhibitors in these clinical settings. The results of these trials, while establishing a clear role for ARBs, have been subtly different in distinct patient populations.", 
    "401": "The most recent trials of ARBs in heart failure and myocardial infarction patients suggest a role for angiotensin receptor blockers in patients with heart failure who are intolerant to ACE inhibitors and who are on optimal ACE inhibitor therapy. In patients with acute high-risk myocardial infarction, the VALIANT trial has established that the ARB was as effective as an ACE inhibitor following myocardial infarction. These studies have thus provided clinicians with alternatives to ACE inhibitors in these important clinical syndromes.", 
    "402": "Although recent clinical trials have shown that amlodipine exerts antiatherogenic effects, the mechanism of these effects remains unknown. This study was designed to examine which signal transduction pathway might be important for the antiatherogenic property of amlodipine, as assessed by aortic smooth muscle cell (SMC) phenotypes in hypertension in vivo. Stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) were randomly treated with a vehicle, amlodipine, or enalapril while Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) used as controls were treated with only the vehicle. Both drugs were equally effective at reducing systolic blood pressure, and inhibiting the progression of aortic remodeling and fibrosis in comparison to those of vehicle-treated SHRSP. In the aortas of vehicle-treated SHRSP, the level of contractile-type smooth muscle (SM) myosin heavy chain (MHC) SM2 was significantly lower, whereas the level of synthetic-type MHC NMHC-B/SMemb was significantly higher compared with those in the WKY aortas. Compared to the vehicle-treated SHRSP group, both drugs significantly and equally shifted the aortic SMC phenotype in SHRSP toward the differentiated state by reducing NMHC-B/SMemb and increasing SM2. The levels of MKK6, p38 MAPK, MEK1 and p-42/44 ERK were significantly higher in the vehicle-treated SHRSP than in the WKY. Both drugs significantly reduced these values in the SHRSP aorta. Furthermore, the levels of MEK1 and p-42/44 ERK were significantly lower in the amlodipine- than in the enalapril-treated SHRSP group, whereas enalapril was more effective than amlodipine at increasing p-Akt and endothelial NO synthase in SHRSP aortas, which were significantly lower in the vehicle SHRSP group than in the WKY group. Thus, the MEK-ERK pathway might be one of the crucial determinants of the aortic SMC phenotype activated by amlodipine treatment of hypertension in vivo.",

We performed cross-sectional studies on the current status of BP control and the prescription and efficacy of antihypertensive drugs in hypertensive patients in Japan. The data were also evaluated in subgroups with or without diabetes mellitus (DM) and in winter and summer. Analyses were performed on the collected data of 12,437 treated hypertensive patients in winter and 5,972 in summer 2002. In winter, 50.3% of patients received calcium channel blockers (CCBs), 15.3% received angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and 11.0% received angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). In the patients receiving monotherapy, 69% of patients received a CCB, 13% an ACEI and 11.0% an ARB. A total of 2,918 patients received combination therapy, and CCBs were the most frequently (89.6%) prescribed component of such therapy. Prescriptions of beta-blockers (BBs) decreased and those of CCBs and diuretics (D) increased with age (p<0.001). The rate of patients with adequately controlled BP less than 140/90 mmHg was 40.3% in the CCB group, 37.6% in the D group, and 36.9% in the BB group (p<0.001). In patients receiving combination therapy, those with CCB+D had the best rate of BP control (40.7%). The rate of patients with adequately controlled BP was lower in winter than in summer at both a target BP of 140/90 mmHg (36.2% vs. 43.8%, p<0.001) and a target BP of 130/85 mmHg in patients younger than 60 years old (15.5% vs. 18.6%, p<0.02). In diabetic patients, the target BP (130/80 mmHg) was achieved in only 11.3%, which was lower (p<0.05) than the rate in non-diabetic patients (13.1%). In conclusion, the present cross-sectional study showed that CCBs were the most frequently prescribed agent for the treatment of hypertension in Japan. The rate of adequate BP control was less than 50% and was even worse in patients with DM and in winter. Our results indicate that physicians should treat hypertension more intensively to achieve the target BP.", 
    "404": "We previously reported that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) promote collateral circulation in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). There have been many reports on the beneficial effects of angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) on the cardiac microvasculature. Therefore, the following studies were performed to evaluate the association between treatment with an ARB and the enhancement of coronary collateral circulation as assessed by the Rentrop Score (RS) (Study 1) and to compare these results to those obtained with an ACE-I (Study 2). The subjects were 456 patients with angina who underwent coronary angiography. Study 1: Those who had one (1-V), two (2-V) or three significantly stenosed vessels (3-V) and who received only an ARB without any other anti-hypertensive medication were defined as the ARB group (n=81), and age-, sex- and body mass index-matched subjects (n=146) were selected as a comparative group. There were no significant differences in the percentage of patients with RS>or=1 between the two groups. Study 2: Those who received an ACE-I as the only anti-hypertensive treatment were defined as the ACE-I group (n=67), which was matched to the ARB group in Study 1. The percentage of patients with RS>or=1 in the ACE-I group was significantly higher than that in the ARB group as assessed by a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel analysis. In addition, patients with 3-V disease who were treated with an ACE-I, but not an ARB, were most likely (odds ratio [confidence Interval]): 27.7 [4.8-161.0]) to show enhanced collateral circulation, as assessed by a multiple logistic regression analysis. These results suggest that treatment with an ACE-I, but not treatment with an ARB, was associated with the enhancement of collateral circulation in patients with CAD.",

We evaluated the effect of long-term and strict antihypertensive therapy with and without the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) imidapril on left ventricular hypertrophy using a novel indicator of chronic burden on the left ventricle, the area under the blood pressure curve x the duration of high blood pressure (AUSBP and AUDBP), in patients with essential hypertension. The patients were divided into 2 groups: an ACEI group, in which imidapril was used in addition to antihypertensive drugs such as Ca channel blockers, beta-blockers, diuretics or angiotensin II antagonist; and a non-ACEI group, in which Ca channel blockers and diuretics were used. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures (SBP and DBP) were both maintained at below 140 and 90 mmHg, respectively, for 2 years. There was no significant difference in the left ventricular mass (LVM) assessed by echocardiography at baseline and that at 2 years of follow-up in the non-ACEI group. However, the LVM in the ACEI group was significantly decreased at 2 years of follow-up as compared to that at the baseline visit. There was no difference in the mean AUSBP and AUDBP between the ACEI and non-ACEI groups. Changes in the LVM were not correlated with the AUSBP or AUDBP in both the ACEI and non-ACEI groups. These findings suggest that the decrease in the LVM in the ACEI group was mediated through mechanisms other than the blood pressure lowering-effect and that AUSBP and AUDBP may be novel indicators of the long-term burden on the left ventricle.",

Hypertension is an extremely common comorbidity in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The coexistence of hypertension in patients with type 2 diabetes is particularly destructive because of the strong linkage of the two conditions with CVD, stroke, progression of renal disease, and diabetic nephropathy.

The inflammatory reaction in the heart was investigated 7 days post-MI by determination of macrophage infiltration and the expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-6 at mRNA and protein levels. Six weeks post-MI, cardiac function was measured following chronic implantation of catheters in the LV and femoral artery, and cardiac morphology and coronary structure were investigated in picrosirius-red stained hearts. In placebo-treated rats, macrophage infiltration was accompanied by upregulation of IL-1beta and IL-6 mRNA in the peri-infarct zone. TNF-alpha and IL-1beta mRNA and protein were also upregulated in the non-infarcted myocardium. Whereas both treatment regimes significantly reduced IL-6 upregulation, olmesartan additionally reduced macrophage infiltration and IL-1beta expression. Six weeks post-MI, placebo-treated MI animals developed an impaired cardiac function with structural remodeling of the myocardium and coronaries. While olmesartan and ramipril both improved cardiac function and reduced infarct size and myocardial/coronary remodeling, olmesartan was more effective not only in increasing vascular perimeter, inner vascular diameter and septal thickness but also in lowering media thickness of coronary arteries, inner left ventricular diameter, left ventricular circumference and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure than ramipril. Thus, following MI the AT1 receptor blocker, olmesartan, attenuated cardiac inflammatory reactions and protected myocardial/coronary structure and function of the failing heart proving to be of similar, in some cases superior effectiveness in this respect than the ACE inhibitor, ramipril.",

The cost-effectiveness of screening for albumnuria was determined to be euro 16,700/LYG for the study population. Stochastic analysis indicated that the probability of the cost-effectiveness being below the suggested Dutch threshold of euro 20,000/LYG was 59% in the baseline analysis. The probability of cost-effectiveness below euro 20,000/LYG would increase to 91% if only subjects with UAE >50 mg/d were treated with fosinopril.

The etiology of acute coronary syndrome during pregnancy can be divided into two main groups: atherosclerotic mechanisms, more common in older mothers, and non-atherosclerotic mechanisms like dissection, coronary spasm and thrombosis. Management of these patients remains difficult; the treatment should follow the usual principles of care for acute coronary syndrome but taking in account that many standard treatments, such the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, are contraindicated.

In patients with diastolic blood pressure > 90 mmHg after 2 weeks of treatment, the dose of barnidipine or benazepril was increased by 5 or 10 mg, respectively. Both the barnidipine-treated group (n = 43) and the benazepril-treated group (n = 42) showed significant mean reductions from baseline in sitting systolic and diastolic blood pressures. The decrease in diastolic blood pressure with benazepril was significantly greater than with barnidipine treatment. Sitting heart rate was not changed by either drug.

Clinical signs of severe infarction, moreover, were more common among the aged patients (pulmonary congestion 45.4 vs 19.7%; left bundle branch block 12.7 vs 3.6%). Pre-hospital time was prolonged (2.8 vs 2 h) and guideline-recommended therapy was applied significantly less frequently to AMI patients over 75 (reperfusion therapy 39.8 vs 71.7%, beta-blockers 62.8 vs 78.3%, statins 26.5 vs 45.5%). Multivariate analysis revealed the following factors to be independent predictors of hospital mortality in patients over 75: age (OR 1.05 per year), acute heart failure (OR 2.39), pre-hospital resuscitation (OR 10.6), cardiogenic shock (OR 2.73), pre-hospital delay >12 h (OR 1.68), and ST elevation in the first ECG (OR 2.09).

Atherosclerotic plaques in these mice contain large numbers of T cells and macrophages. Crossbreeding apolipoprotein E-deficient mice with T-cell-deficient mice and mice with impaired macrophage function (osteopetrotic op/op mice) disclosed the important impact of immune cells on atherosclerotic lesion development. In contrast to the detrimental role of T cells and macrophages, B cells appear to be atheroprotective. These basic experimental findings have partly been confirmed in studies of the human carotid artery system. Inflammation is not only instrumental in the development of human atheromatous plaques, but, importantly, plays a crucial role in the destabilization of internal carotid artery plaques, thus converting chronic atherosclerosis into an acute thrombo-embolic disorder. Humoral factors involved in internal carotid artery destabilization include cytokines, cyclooxygenase-2, matrix metalloproteinases, and tissue factor. Antibodies to oxidized LDL can reflect disease activity on one hand, but can also confer atheroprotection. Novel MRI techniques may aid in the in vivo assessment of acute plaque inflammation in humans.",

The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of this triple vasopeptidase inhibitor (VPI) on the hemodynamic profile of instrumented, conscious, and unrestrained Dahl salt-sensitive (DSS) rats, a gene-prone, high-salt diet-induced low-renin hypertension model. Male DSS rats (mean weight [+/-SEM], 385 +/- 10 g) were fed a normal diet (Group 1) or a high-salt diet (Groups 2 and 3; 8% NaCl in food) for 6 weeks and then instrumented with a carotid catheter and placed individually in metabolic cages for 30 days. The hemodynamic, hematological, and biochemical profiles were assessed daily. Dose-dependent treatment started after a 7-day stabilization period in Groups 1 and 2 (vehicle dosage, 250 microl/hr) and Group 3 (CGS 35601 dosages of 0.1, 1, and 5 mg/kg/day for 6 days per dose by means of constant intra-arterial infusion), followed by a 5-day washout period. Two additional groups included normotensive Wistar rats (Group 4) and DSS rats that received a double high-salt solid (8% NaCl) and liquid (1% NaCl) diet (Group 5). The MABP in rats receiving CGS 35601 decreased in a dose-dependent fashion toward the baseline level observed in DSS rats receiving a normal diet. The heart rate was unaffected. The hemodynamic profile returned to normal during the washout period. This novel triple VPI is a potent and effective antihypertensive agent with a safe short-term profile that may be of interest for treating hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases.

The aim of the present study was to establish the hemodynamic profile of Zucker diabetic fatty (Zdf)-Fatty rats, a high-fat diet gene-prone model developing spontaneous Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and the effects of CGS 35601. Male Zdf-Fatty (14 weeks, n = 17-23), Zdf-Lean (14 weeks, n = 8-10), and Wistar (14 weeks, n = 9-10) rats on distinct diets were implanted with a catheter in the left carotid and placed individually in a metabolic cage for 30 days. The hemodynamic profile and some metabolic biomarkers were assessed daily. After a 7-day stabilization period, the Zdf-Fatty rats were divided into two groups: Group 1, controls (n = 7-10) receiving vehicle-saline (250 microl/hr) and Group 2, (n = 10-13) receiving increasing doses of CGS 35601 (0.1, 1, and 5 mg/kg/day x 6 days each, intra-arterially) followed by a 5-day washout period. Mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) of young Zdf-Fatty rats was compared with age-matched Zdf-Lean and Wistar rats, which were found similar. MABP decreased by 5.9% (from baseline at 102 +/- 5 to 96 +/- 4 mmHg), 12.7% (to 89 +/- 6 mmHg) and 21.6% (to 80 +/- 4 mmHg), at 0.1, 1, and 5 mg/kg/day, respectively, in CGS 35601-treated Zdf-Fatty rats. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were similarly reduced. The heart rate was not affected. Hyperglycemic status and insulin-resistance were not modulated by short-term treatment. CGS 35601 presented an excellent short-term safety profile. This novel molecule and class of VPI may be of interest for lowering vascular tone. Further long-term studies, once cardiovascular and renal complications have developed in this T2D rat model are warranted to define the efficacy of this class of VPI.",

Bradykinin, a peptide released from kininogen by kallikreins, stimulates vasodilatation and endothelial cell proliferation. Various classes of substances can potentiate these biological actions of bradykinin. Among them, the best studied are bradykinin potentiating peptides (BPPs) derived from snake venom, which can also strongly inhibit angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) activity. We identified and synthesized sequences resembling BPPs in the vicinity of potential proteolytic cleavage sites in the collagen XVIII molecule, close to endostatin. These peptides were screened as inhibitors of human recombinant wild-type ACE containing two intact functional domains; two full-length ACE mutants containing only a functional C- or N-domain catalytic site; and human testicular ACE, a natural form of the enzyme that only contains the C-domain. The BPP-like peptides inhibited ACE in the micromolar range and interacted preferentially with the C-domain. The proteolytic activity involved in the release of BPP-like peptides was studied in human serum and human umbilical-vein endothelial cells. The presence of enzymes able to release these peptides in blood led us to speculate on a physiological mechanism for the control of ACE activities.",

The prorenin-to-active renin ratio significantly increases in diabetes, and prorenin binding to its receptor in diabetic animal kidney induces the nephropathy without its conventional proteolytic activation, suggesting that angiotensin II (AngII) may not be the decisive factor causing the nephropathy. For identification of an AngII-independent mechanism, diabetes was induced in wild-type mice and AngII type 1a receptor gene-deficient mice by streptozotocin treatment, and their development and progression of diabetic nephropathy were assessed. In addition, prolonged inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme and prolonged prorenin receptor blockade were compared for their efficacy in preventing the nephropathy that occurred in diabetic AngII type 1a receptor gene-deficient mice. Only the prorenin receptor blockade with a short peptide of prorenin practically abolished the increased mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation and nephropathy despite unaltered increase in AngII in diabetic kidney. These results indicate that the MAPK activation signal leads to the diabetic nephropathy but not other renin-angiotensin system-activated mechanisms in the glomeruli.

    "468": "In this observational study, aspirin use was not associated with an increase in mortality rates or HF readmission rates, and aspirin did not attenuate the benefits of ACE inhibitors, even in patients without coronary disease, patients with renal dysfunction, or patients treated with high-dose aspirin and low-dose ACE inhibitors.", 
    "469": "Twenty-one cats with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were enrolled in this study to determine if the administration of benazepril (0.5 mg/kg body weight [BW], PO, q24h) to cats with subclinical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy improves cardiac diastolic function and reverses left ventricular hypertrophy when compared with diltiazem controlled delivery (CD) (10 mg/kg BW, PO, q24h). Cats were evaluated at day 0 and after 3 and 6 months of therapy. In the benazepril group (n = 11), the diastolic transmitral flow of the E and A waves ratio (E/A ratio) increased significantly between 0 and 6 months (P = 0.009) and the thickness of the left ventricular free wall in systole (LVFWs) decreased significantly between 0 and 3 months (P = 0.04). In the diltiazem CD group (n = 5), none of the parameters varied significantly throughout the study. There was no difference between the benazepril and the diltiazem CD group throughout the study. Therefore, the variations observed for the E/A ratio and the LVFWs may have been incidental. Further studies will be needed to establish the role of benazepril in subclinical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in cat.", 
    "470": "Ramipril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor for use in dogs, is converted in vivo to its active form, ramiprilat, which is eliminated in the bile and urine in the dog. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics (PKs) and pharmacodynamics (PDs) of ramipril and ramiprilat. Ten adult Beagle dogs were used. PK/PD studies were performed before and after the induction of subclinical renal impairment. Ramiprilat was given at 0.25 mg/kg by a single IV bolus. After a 2-week washout period, ramipril was administered PO at 0.25 mg/kg once daily for 8 days. Ramipril and ramiprilat PKs were studied by using a physiologically based model. The relationship between free plasma ramiprilat concentration and ACE activity was described by using the fractional Hill model. Glomerular filtration rate was decreased by 58%. No biologically relevant changes in usual plasma variables were observed between the 1st and the 8th day of oral treatment with ramipril under either condition. After an IV bolus of ramiprilat, the only changes in renal-impaired dogs were a 14 and 49% decrease in clearance of the free fraction of ramiprilat (P < .01) and free plasma concentration required to produce 50% of the maximal effect (P < .05), respectively. After repeated PO administration of ramipril, there were no alterations in any of the PK and PD parameters in healthy or renal-impaired dogs. No adjustment of the recommended PO dosage of ramipril is needed in dogs with moderate renal impairment.", 
    "471": "Most of the interest in the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) stems from the observation that it undergoes morphological changes in renal disease. Studies on persistent proteinuria in experimental animal models have shown that the permeability properties of the GBM have been altered as a result of protein degradation and cross-linking of type IV collagen via its NC1 domains promoted by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and extrusion of tubular cell contents. We used the in vitro ultrafiltration technique to assess permeability properties of bare isolated GBM films to water and albumin in the Munich Wistar Fromter rat model of glomerular injury. Hydraulic permeability for water and albumin solutions and albumin fractional clearances were measured for rats treated with lisinopril [an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor] and were compared with those measured for rats treated with dimethylthiouria (an ROS scavenger) and their control groups, at four pressure levels (50, 100, 200, and 300 mmHg). The ACE inhibitors and ROS scavengers treatment regimens for studied rats in addition to significantly lowering their systolic blood pressure and urinary protein excretion values to normal levels, have significantly increased their in vitro hydraulic and Darcy permeability, which is a measure of the intrinsic hydraulic conductance of the GBM, either in the absence or presence of albumin; in comparison with control animals. We believe that these favorable effects may derive from ROS scavenging beneficial effects that preserve the GBM protein structure by reducing entactin and laminin degradation and type IV collagen cross-linking.",

In acute experiment, Ang II (30 to 480 ng/kg intravenous) was given in LH rats treated acutely with perindopril (1.5 mg/kg, intravenous bolus).", 
    "474": "Administration of Ang II induced dose-dependent decreases in MBF, which were greater in LH than in LL rats. In LL rats, the initial and short-lasting (<1 min) medullary vasoconstriction evoked by Ang II was followed by a long-lasting (>2 min) and dose-dependent medullary vasodilation, which was blunted in LH rats. Chronic perindopril treatment normalized the blood pressure level in LH rats and corrected their blunted medullary vasodilation, whereas the same treatment had no significant effect in LL rats. In chronically perindopril-treated LH rats, indomethacin decreased by 90% the medullary vasodilation induced by Ang II. Acute perindopril treatment did not modify the medullary responses to Ang II in LH rats.", 
    "475": "Chronic ACE inhibition restores the vasodilator response of MBF to Ang II in LH rats. This effect, which is not observed after acute inhibition, is mainly mediated through the release of prostaglandins.",

Increased matrix synthesis has been well documented but the effects of diabetes on degradative pathways, particularly in the in vivo setting. The renal protective effect of these pathways on matrix accumulation has not been fully elucidated. The present study was undertaken to investigate the activity of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), the expression of MMP-2 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2) in kidney tissues of diabetic rats, and to explore the degradative pathway of type IV collagen (IV-C) and the renal protective effects of ACE inhibition-benazepril.", 
    "477": "Twenty-four healthy male Wistar rats were divided randomly into normal control group (NC group), untreated diabetes mellitus group (DM group), and diabetes mellitus group treated with benazepril (DL group). The rat model of diabetes mellitus was induced by intraperitoneal injection of streptozocin (60 mg/kg). After the establishment of DM model, benazepril (10 mg.kg(-1).d(-1)) was given to the DL group for 12 weeks, and the same volume of water was given to the other two groups. At the end of 12 weeks, renal function was evaluated with 24-hour urinary protein (Upro), clearance of creatinine (Ccr), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). MMP-2 activity was determined by gelatin zymography. The levels of MMP-2, TIMP-2 and collagen IV (IV-C) protein in the kidney tissue were assessed by immunohistochemistry. The gene expression of MMP-2 and TIMP-2 was measured by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).", 
    "478": "The levels of BUN, Upro and Ccr in the DM group were higher than those in the NC group. In the DM group, the mRNA, enzymatic activity and proteins of MMP-2 decreased, but the expressions of IV-C and TIMP-2 increased. All diabetes-associated changes in renal function and MMP/TIMP were attenuated after benazepril treatment with reduced IV-C accumulation.", 
    "479": "The changes of MMP-2 and TIMP-2 expressions in kidney tissues of diabetes rats may contribute to the occurrence and progression of diabetic nephropathy. Benazepril could exert protective effects on diabetic nephropathy, owing to the upregulation of MMP-2 and downregulation of TIMP-2 expressions, which further inhibits the excessive deposition of extracellular matrix in the glomerulus.", 
    "480": "The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system plays a key role in the regulation of fluid and electrolyte balance. Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) inhibit angiotensin II type 1 receptors and large clinical trials have shown that they are effective in many cardiovascular diseases including hypertension, heart failure, myocardial infarction and diabetic nephropathy. They lower blood pressure effectively, are very well tolerated and can be used as monotherapy or in combination with other drug classes for the treatment of hypertension. ARBs are particularly suitable for hypertensive patients with co-morbidities such as diabetes, microalbuminuria, proteinuria, left ventricular hypertrophy and heart failure. Unlike angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, ARBs do not cause persistent dry cough. For patients in whom angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are indicated but not tolerated, an ARB should be considered. Periodic monitoring of renal function and electrolytes is required in patients treated with an ARB.", 
    "481": "The overall incidence of heart failure increases with age, affecting up to 10% of people >65 years of age. Diastolic heart failure is also age-dependent, increasing from <15% in middle-aged patients to >40% in patients > or =70 years of age. Elderly patients usually have other co-morbid conditions such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation that can adversely affect the diastolic properties of the heart. The clinical manifestations of diastolic heart failure are similar to those of systolic heart failure. In practice, the diagnosis is generally based on the finding of typical symptoms and signs of heart failure with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction and no valvular abnormalities on echocardiography. Altered ventricular relaxation and abnormal ventricular filling are the hallmarks of diastolic heart failure. Cardiac fibrosis and cellular disarray lead to the alterations in the diastolic properties of the heart. Diffuse foci of fibrosis in the myocardium have been reported with advancing age. Aldosterone has been shown to play a crucial role in the development of cardiac fibrosis via a direct effect on the mineralocorticoid receptors within the myocardium. Unlike the situation with treatment of systolic heart failure, few clinical trials are available to guide the management of patients with diastolic heart failure. In the absence of controlled clinical trials, patient management is based on control of the physiological factors (blood pressure, heart rate, blood volume and myocardial ischaemia) that are known to exert important effects on ventricular relaxation. Aldosterone antagonists inhibit the deposition of collagen matrix in the myocardium, thereby targeting the basic pathophysiological mechanism of diastolic dysfunction. Thus, they appear to represent a promising therapeutic approach for this condition. Currently, only small clinical trials supporting this therapy are available and large clinical trials evaluating long-term outcomes in diastolic dysfunction are therefore needed.", 
    "482": "The purpose of this study was to assess patients' and physicians' compliance with ACE inhibitor treatment, by measuring an endogenous biomarker of ACE inhibition, urinary N-acetyl-Ser-Asp-Lys-Pro (AcSDKP), in the Noninsulin-Dependent Diabetes, Hypertension, Microalbuminuria, Proteinuria, Cardiovascular Events, and Ramipril (DIABHYCAR) trial, which compared ramipril (1.25 mg o.d.) with placebo in 4,912 patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria/proteinuria.",

Urinary AcSDKP-to-creatinine ratios displayed a bimodal distribution in both groups, with a very large intergroup overlap. Based on cluster analysis, we defined truly adherent ramipril patients as those with a ratio > or =4 nmol/mmol and truly adherent placebo patients as those with a ratio < 4 nmol/mmol. After excluding patients withdrawing prematurely from the study or known to have used a nonstudy ACE inhibitor, 27.3% of the 597 ramipril patients had ratios <4, indicating poor compliance, and 9.7% of the 621 placebo patients had ratios > or =4, indicating intake of a nonstudy ACE inhibitor. Correcting for compliance by using AcSDKP-guided analysis affected surrogate outcome results (decrease in systolic blood pressure and urinary albumin excretion) only slightly.", 
    "485": "The systematic use of spot urinary AcSDKP determination facilitated the detection of defects in compliance with ACE inhibitor treatment in both patients and physicians. Urinary AcSDKP measurement could be a useful biomarker for assessing compliance with ACE inhibition in the routine care of diabetic patients.", 
    "486": "We present a case of potentially life-threatening postoperative swelling of the tongue and oropharynx that developed in the postanesthesia care unit in a patient taking lisinopril. The principal treatment of angioedema is the discontinuation of the precipitating agent and airway management. Patients with swelling limited to the face and oral cavity may only require monitoring. However, those with swelling in the floor of the mouth, tongue, and supraglottic or glottic areas should have their airway secured by tracheal intubation immediately. Early intubation in patients displaying these characteristics may decrease the incidence of emergent surgical airways. Angioedema is self-limiting, and the swelling usually resolves spontaneously in two to 3 days. Proper identification of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-associated angioedema requiring a timely airway intervention may reduce mortality, and recognition of its self-limiting course can prevent unnecessary tracheostomy.",

Average age was 55 years, 61% were men, and the mean of the first glomerular filtration rate in the study was 46 mL/min/1.73 m2 (0.76 mL/s). No significant differences in HRQOL were seen between the low- and usual-blood-pressure groups. Reported side effects also were similar between blood-pressure groups. Mean Physical Health Component (PHC) and Mental Health Component (MHC) scores had a significantly smaller decrease in the ramipril than metoprolol group in both the initial period from baseline to year 1 (PHC, 2.08 +/- 0.56; MHC, 1.89 +/- 0.62) and during the first 4 years of follow-up (PHC, 1.60 +/- 0.44; MHC, 1.48 +/- 0.48).

Risk has been shown to increase continuously with increasing urinary albumin levels, starting at levels that once were considered normal. This association is maintained even after adjusting for numerous other factors. Studies also established that a decrease in albuminuria leads to improvement in both cardiovascular and renal outcomes. These data suggest that urinary albumin should be measured routinely and treated to afford cardiovascular and renoprotection.",

Reconstruction was achieved by near complete resection of the anterior mitral valve leaflet and retention of the peripheral margin of coaptation including primary and secondary chordae. The body of the anterior mitral valve leaflet was reconstructed using fresh autologous pericardium, a technique not previously reported in an infant of this size.

    "493": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV). SARS-CoV spike (S) protein, a type I membrane-bound protein, is essential for the viral attachment to the host cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). By screening 312 controlled Chinese medicinal herbs supervised by Committee on Chinese Medicine and Pharmacy at Taiwan, we identified that three widely used Chinese medicinal herbs of the family Polygonaceae inhibited the interaction of SARS-CoV S protein and ACE2. The IC(50) values for Radix et Rhizoma Rhei (the root tubers of Rheum officinale Baill.), Radix Polygoni multiflori (the root tubers of Polygonum multiflorum Thunb.), and Caulis Polygoni multiflori (the vines of P. multiflorum Thunb.) ranged from 1 to 10 microg/ml. Emodin, an anthraquinone compound derived from genus Rheum and Polygonum, significantly blocked the S protein and ACE2 interaction in a dose-dependent manner. It also inhibited the infectivity of S protein-pseudotyped retrovirus to Vero E6 cells. These findings suggested that emodin may be considered as a potential lead therapeutic agent in the treatment of SARS.", 
    "494": "The role of the alpha-adrenergic system in the control of cardiac preload (central venous blood pressure; P(ven)) and venous capacitance during exercise was investigated in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). In addition, the antihypotensive effect of the renin-angiotesin system (RAS) was investigated during exercise after alpha-adrenoceptor blockade. Fish were subjected to a 20-min exercise challenge at 0.66 body lengths s(-1) (BL s(-1)) while P(ven), dorsal aortic blood pressure (P(da)) and relative cardiac output (Q) was recorded continuously. Heart rate (f(H)), cardiac stroke volume (SV) and total systemic resistance (R(sys)) were derived from these variables. The mean circulatory filling pressure (MCFP) was measured at rest and at the end of the exercise challenge, to investigate potential exercise-mediated changes in venous capacitance. The protocol was repeated after alpha-adrenoceptor blockade with prazosin (1 mg kg(-1)M(b)) and again after additional blockade of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) with enalapril (1 mg kg(-1)M(b)). In untreated fish, exercise was associated with a rapid (within approx. 1-2 min) and sustained increase in Q and P(ven) associated with a significant increase in MCFP (0.17+/-0.02 kPa at rest to 0.27+/-0.02 kPa at the end of exercise). Prazosin treatment did not block the exercise-mediated increase in MCFP (0.25+/-0.04 kPa to 0.33+/-0.04 kPa at the end of exercise), but delayed the other cardiovascular responses to swimming such that Q and P(ven) did not increase significantly until around 10-13 min of exercise, suggesting that an endogenous humoral control mechanism had been activated. Subsequent enalapril treatment revealed that these delayed responses were in fact due to activation of the RAS, because resting P(da) and R(sys) were decreased further and essentially all cardiovascular changes during exercise were abolished. This study shows that the alpha-adrenergic system normally plays an important role in the control of venous function during exercise in rainbow trout. It is also the first study to suggest that the RAS may be an important modulator of venous pressure and capacitance in fish.",

    "496": "The risk factors for hypertension are only partly known, and accounts for the some of the deficiencies in current primary prevention strategies and in the design of new drugs for the management of this common condition. Recently, chronic low grade low-grade inflammation has been identified as an integral part in the pathogenesis of vascular disease. Of note, inflammation may also be implicated in the development of hypertension, either as a primary or secondary event. Indeed, several clinical studies have demonstrated increased numbers of well recognised pro-inflammatory markers, such as high sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), in patients with hypertension, even after adjustment for potential confounding factors. Furthermore, elevated hsCRP levels have also been shown to be predictive for the development of hypertension in prehypertensive and normotensive patients. Pathophysiologically, inflammation has been implicated in both endothelial (dys)function and arterial stiffness in hypertension, with reduced availability of nitric oxide (NO) being integral to this process. Oxidative stress also appears to be a key feature in the reduced availability of NO and is aggravated by increased circulating angiotensin II (Ang II). Importantly, there is some evidence that drugs commonly used in the management of hypertension, such as statins, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and Ang II receptor blockers have anti-inflammatory properties that can positively influence outcomes in patients with hypertension. The inflammatory state in hypertension may pose a new therapeutic target for future drug design.", 
    "497": "While symptoms are common during the detection and treatment of hypertensive patients it is rarely the case that either uncomplicated essential hypertension (of whatever severity) or treatment presents insurmountable problems. Unfortunately they frequently result in changes in effective therapy or encourage clinicians and prescribers to settle with altered and inadequate treatment goals. This review considers the association of patients' symptoms in the management of hypertension. It considers the relationship of symptoms at the time of diagnosis and the impact of symptoms voiced during active drug treatment. The data relating antihypertensive therapy to adverse symptoms during chronic therapy and the consequences of this on treatment goals are summarised.", 
    "498": "In patients with heart failure (HF), peak exercise oxygen consumption (VO2) is an important prognostic tool on which critical clinical decisions are made. However, recent retrospective data have suggested that ventilatory equivalent (VE = ventilation [liters per minute]/VO2 [liters per minute]) may be a stronger predictor of outcomes than VO2 in patients with HF on modern medical therapies. We prospectively collected baseline demographics, cardiovascular history, hemodynamics, and exercise ventilatory data from 221 consecutive patients with HF who underwent treadmill exercise VO2 testing. The composite primary end point was death or heart transplantation. Mean follow-up was 508 days, during which 27 events occurred (13 deaths and 14 transplantations). One-year event-free survival was 88% (n = 104 with 1-year follow-up). Mean age was 49 years, 68% were men, 84% were taking beta blockers, 82% were taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and 21% had an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. Mean VO2 was 16 +/- 5 ml/kg/min. Mean VE was 47.4 +/- 15.2. Univariate predictors of events included lower VO2 (p <0.0001), higher heart rate at rest (p = 0.05), and presence of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (p = 0.024). Higher VE (p = 0.10) and lower maximum systolic blood pressure (p = 0.09) were of borderline significance. Age, gender, HF etiology or severity, and other ventilatory parameters were not significant predictors. Multivariate models that incorporated VE, VO2, or their combination confirmed VO2 as an independent predictor of event-free survival (p < or =0.0002); VE did not independently predict outcomes. Other independent predictors were higher heart rate at rest (p < or =0.02) and presence of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (p < or =0.04). In conclusion, peak VO2, but not VE, predicts clinical outcomes of patients with HF who are treated with contemporary medical therapies.",

The aim of this study was investigate whether the alpha-adducin G460W polymorphism or angiotensinogen M235T polymorphism has an effect on the mean difference in blood pressure in subjects using antihypertensive drugs. Data from the Rotterdam Study, a population-based prospective cohort study in the Netherlands, was used. This study started in 1990 and included 7983 subjects of 55 years and older. Data from three examination rounds were used. Subjects were included when their blood pressure was elevated at 1 or more examinations and/or a diuretic, beta-blocker, calcium antagonist, or ACE inhibitor was used. A marginal generalized linear model was used to assess the drug-gene interaction. In total, 3025 hypertensives were included. No drug-gene interaction on blood pressure levels was found. The mean difference in systolic blood pressure (SBP) between subjects with the W-allele and GG genotype of the alpha-adducin gene was for diuretic users 1.25 mmHg (95% CI:-2.86 to 5.35), for beta-blockers 0.02 mmHg (95% CI:-3.39 to 3.42), for calcium antagonists -0.70 mmHg (95% CI:-5.61 to 4.21), and for ACE inhibitors -3.50 mmHg (95% CI:-9.02 to 2.02).

    "504": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is often accompanied by high blood pressure (BP) and the clustering of several cardiovascular risk factors, and is the most frequent cause of end-stage renal disease. The stages of development of overt nephropathy in T2DM patients range from an initial alteration in renal function with an increased GFR, followed by the development of microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria or proteinuria, featuring an established diabetic nephropathy, which eventually progresses to end-stage renal disease. Early intervention is needed to prevent the development of diabetic nephropathy and requires effective control of the different risk factors, and in particular high BP. In the initial stages of the disease, strict BP control is crucial to prevent the development of initial renal and vascular damage. Adequate BP control is particularly difficult in T2DM patients and in most cases requires the use of combination therapy. Preterax, a fixed-dose combination of perindopril 2 mg and indapamide 0.625 mg, allows BP to be significantly reduced compared with conventional strategies; this combination can be uptitrated to BiPreterax when further BP control is needed. In the PREMIER study performed in T2DM over 12 months, the perindopril/indapamide combination brought about, in addition to excellent BP control, a significant reduction in urinary albumin excretion, compared with monotherapy with enalapril. In more advanced degrees of renal damage, higher doses of the fixed combination have to be considered. The pharmacological basis of the renoprotective effect of perindopril/indapamide is the demonstration that this combination prevented nephropathy as well as proteinuria in obese Zucker rats, independently of BP control. Strict BP control from the initial stages of nephropathy together with inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system is mandatory to prevent albuminuria. The fixed combination of perindopril/indapamide can greatly help clinicians in achieving the above goals, using Preterax in the early and BiPreterax in the late stages of nephropathy.", 
    "505": "Pharmacological treatment of hypertension represents a cost-effective way of preventing cardiovascular and renal complications. To benefit maximally from antihypertensive treatment, blood pressure should be brought to below 140/90 mmHg in every hypertensive patient, and even lower (< 130/80 mmHg) if diabetes or renal disease co-exists. Such targets cannot usually be reached using monotherapies. This is especially true in patients who present with a high cardiovascular risk. The co-administration of two agents acting by different mechanisms considerably increases the blood pressure control rate. Such combinations are not only efficacious, but are also well tolerated, and some fixed low-dose combinations even have a placebo-like tolerability. This is the case for the preparation containing the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril (2 mg) and the diuretic indapamide (0.625 mg), a fixed low-dose combination that has been shown in controlled trials to be more effective than monotherapies in reducing albuminuria, regressing cardiac hypertrophy and improving the stiffness of large arteries. Using this combination to initiate antihypertensive therapy has been shown in a double-blind trial (Strategies of Treatment in Hypertension: Evaluation; STRATHE) to normalize blood pressure (< 140/90 mmHg) in significantly more patients (62%) than a sequential monotherapy approach based on atenolol, losartan and amlodipine (49%) and a stepped-care strategy based on valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide (47%), with no difference between the three arm groups in terms of tolerability. An ongoing randomized trial (Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron Modified Release Controlled Evaluation; ADVANCE) is a study with a 2 x 2 factorial design assessing the effects of the fixed-dose perindopril-indapamide combination and of the intensive gliclazide modified release-based glucose control regimen in type 2 diabetic patients, with or without hypertension. A total of 11 140 patients were randomly selected. Within the first 6 weeks of treatment (run-in phase), the perindopril-indapamide combination lowered blood pressure from 145/81 +/- 22/11 mmHg (mean +/- SD) to 137/78 +/- 20/10 mmHg. Fixed-dose combinations are becoming more and more popular for the management of hypertension, and are even proposed by hypertension guidelines as a first-line option to treat hypertensive patients.", 
    "506": "Brachial pulse pressure (PP) is now a well-established cardiovascular risk factor. Central rather than peripheral PP should be measured to determine the 'true' haemodynamic effects of antihypertensive agents on target organs. Peripheral PP, measured at the brachial artery, does not reflect central PP (either carotid or ascending aorta), because their determinants are different and pathophysiological conditions and drugs may change central PP without changing peripheral PP. Central PP (i.e. carotid artery or ascending aorta) has shown an independent predictive value for all-cause mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease and in the hypertensive patients of the CAFE study. Antihypertensive treatment has repeatedly demonstrated its ability to prevent cardiovascular events. Whether the effect on cardiovascular events in clinical trials comparing two pharmacological classes or two therapeutic strategies is, at least partly, the result of differential effects on PP remains to be demonstrated. It is therefore of major importance to determine which therapeutic strategies may differentially lower central PP, and in turn reduce cardiovascular events. In clinical practice, lowering PP is often a difficult task, particularly in diabetic hypertensive individuals. In the PARADIS study, we aimed to determine, in a population of hypertensive patients with both type 2 diabetes and PP greater than 60 mmHg, which clinical characteristics predict the fall in PP on treatment and a reduction in cardiovascular events. The reinforcement of therapeutic measures, including a fixed low-dose perindopril/indapamide combination, made possible the effective lowering of PP and cardiovascular events in type 2 diabetic hypertensive patients, under conditions of usual care by general practitioners and specialists.",

In theory, combining an ACEI and ARB might be beneficial, whereas clinical evidence for this approach in hypertension is lacking. An ACEI-ARB combination is likely to be useful in proteinuric renal disease, but recent experimental evidence suggests that very high dose monotherapy with an ARB may be the best approach. However, the results of large outcome studies for combinations vs. ACEI or ARB monotherapy are still awaited.", 
    "517": "This study describes the development of a CE method for the analysis of the antihypertensive drug captopril using LIF detection. The method is based on the derivatization of captopril with the fluorescent label 5-iodoacetamidofluorescein. The optimization of the electrophoretic electrolyte composition together with other variables, such as applied voltage and injection time, resulted in a solution of 20 mM phosphate buffer adjusted to pH 12.0. The calibration curve for the fluorescent captopril derivative was linear in the concentration range 3.5-6000 ng/mL with a detection limit of 0.5 ng/mL. Intra- and interday precision (at a concentration of about 100 times the LOD) were less than 0.86 and 1.16%, respectively, both expressed as RSD. The assay was successfully used for quantification of captopril in some marketed pharmaceutical preparations and urine samples.", 
    "518": "AT1 receptor blockers and ACE inhibitors decrease the risk for new onset diabetes mellitus. The phenomenon could be related to a direct angiotensin II effect on tissue metabolism. To address the issue, we recruited eighteen obese hypertensive patients. Patients were randomized to double-blind treatment with either valsartan (n = 8) or atenolol (n = 10) for thirteen weeks. They underwent an oral glucose tolerance test before and during active treatment, while metabolism was monitored through subcutaneous and intramuscular microdialysis and indirect calorimetry. After glucose ingestion, venous glucose and insulin concentrations increased rapidly while systemic free fatty acid concentrations were suppressed. Dialysate glucose and lactate concentrations increased briskly in adipose tissue and in skeletal muscle. Dialysate glycerol decreased profoundly in both tissues. Respiratory quotient increased markedly after glucose ingestion. These responses were identical at baseline and during active treatment either drug. We conclude that AT1 receptor blockade in obese hypertensive patients has no effect on interstitial glucose supply, lipolysis, and substrate oxidation. One possible explanation is that angiotensin II levels in obese hypertensives are not sufficient to elicit the metabolic changes that have been observed after direct angiotensin II application. The exact mechanism by which inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system decreases the diabetes risk remains unresolved and requires further study.",

    "520": "Sesame peptide powder (SPP) exhibited angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity, and significantly and temporarily decreased the systolic blood pressure (SBP) in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) by a single administration (1 and 10 mg/kg). Six peptide ACE inhibitors were isolated and identified from SPP. The representative peptides, Leu-Val-Tyr, Leu-Gln-Pro and Leu-Lys-Tyr, could competitively inhibit ACE activity at respective Ki values of 0.92 microM, 0.50 microM, and 0.48 microM. A reconstituted sesame peptide mixture of Leu-Ser-Ala, Leu-Gln-Pro, Leu-Lys-Tyr, Ile-Val-Tyr, Val-Ile-Tyr, Leu-Val-Tyr, and Met-Leu-Pro-Ala-Tyr according to their content ratio in SPP showed a strong antihypertensive effect on SHR at doses of 3.63 and 36.3 microg/kg, which accounted for more than 70% of the corresponding dosage for the SPP-induced hypotensive effect. Repeated oral administration of SPP also lowered both SBP and the aortic ACE activity in SHR. These results demonstrate that SPP would be a beneficial ingredient for preventing and providing therapy against hypertension and its related diseases.", 
    "521": "This article examines evidence-based findings in the literature on the efficacy of perindopril 2 mg/indapamide 0.625 mg, a first-line, low-dose antihypertensive drug combination. In regulatory Phase II and III trials, perindopril/indapamide significantly lowered blood pressure compared with other first-line therapies (atenolol, losartan and irbesartan). This was also the case in STRAtegies of Treatment in Hypertension: Evaluation, a postregistration study versus current monotherapies and stepped-care therapy with different classes of antihypertensive agents. The efficacy/safety ratio (both clinical and with regard to laboratory parameters) of perindopril/indapamide was good. Perindopril/indapamide provides additional antihypertensive efficacy compared with each component used alone and with current monotherapies, with major efficacy on systolic blood pressure, an important predictor of cardiovascular risk. It also reduces pulse pressure, an independent cardiovascular risk factor, large-vessel arterial stiffness and microcirculatory alterations. The fixed dosage of a once-daily tablet, ensures optimal ease of use and enhances patient compliance. Perindopril/indapamide also reduces target organ damage in patients at high cardiovascular risk, such as patients with cardiac hypertrophy and Type 2 diabetics with albuminuria. These benefits, together with the good efficacy/tolerability ratio, fulfill the requirements of the European Society of Hypertension and of the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure guidelines for low-dose, first-line combination therapy in hypertension.",

ABI was measured in 5,646 Chinese patients at high CV risk, and PAD was defined as an ABI<0.9 in either leg. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with PAD. A total of 5,263 patients were analyzed, 52.9% male, mean age 67.3 years, mean body mass index (BMI) 24.2 kg/m2, mean systolic/diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP) 139/80.7 mmHg. The prevalence of PAD in the total group of patients was 25.4%, and the prevalence was higher in females than in males (27.1% vs. 23.9%; odds ratio [OR]: 1.64). Patients with PAD were older than those without PAD (72.3+/-9.9 years vs. 65.6+/-11.7 years; OR: 1.06), and more frequently had diabetes (43.3% vs. 31.3%; OR: 2.02), coronary heart disease (CHD) (27.0% vs. 18.8%; OR: 1.67), stroke (44.4% vs. 28.3%; OR: 1.78), lipid disorders (57.2% vs. 50.7%; OR: 1.3) and a smoking habit (42.7% vs. 38.6%; OR: 1.52). The ORs for the PAD group compared with the non-PAD group demonstrated that these conditions were inversely related to ABI. Statin, angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitors and antiplatelet agents were only used in 40.5%, 53.6% and 69.1% of PAD patients, respectively. The data demonstrated the high prevalence and low treatment of PAD in Chinese patients at high CV risk. A lower ABI was associated with generalized atherosclerosis. Based on these findings, ABI should be a routine measurement in high risk patients. Aggressive medication was required in these patients.",

Surprisingly, large clinical trials have shown that ROS scavenging by antioxidant vitamins is ineffective or harmful. Therefore, prevention of ROS formation, by targeting specific sources of superoxide anion and other ROS, might prove beneficial. Potential targets include the NADPH oxidases (Nox enzymes), xanthine oxidase, endothelial nitric oxide synthase and mitochondrial oxidases. Nox enzymes play a central role because they can regulate other enzymatic sources of ROS. Statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists block upstream signaling of Nox activation, which contributes to their clinical effectiveness.

The attenuated responses of ACh and L-SNC in SH rats were not improved by hydralazine. The vasodilator effects of MAHMA NONOate, which were substantially augmented in SH rats, were not affected by captopril, enalapril or hydralazine.

For recurrence prevention, beta blockers are the first-choice drugs. In patients with no structural heart disease, class IC antiarrhythmic agents, in those with structural heart disease only amiodarone, may be considered.

    "536": "In clinical practice, Astragali Radix (Astragalus), the root of Astragalus membranaceus Bunge, has been widely applied to treat patients with viral diseases, including viral myocarditis in China. The present study was designed to evaluate the protective effects of Astragalus on the function of sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA2) activity and endothelin system at acute and chronic periods of myocarditis mice induced by CVB(3) infection. Astragalus feeding (2.2 mg/kg/day) could significantly increase the survival rate, alleviate pathological alterations and serum cardiac troponin I (cTnI), as well as restore impaired SERCA activity at the acute stage. Low affinity and capacity of ETR were reversed with Astragalus after the first CVB(3) inoculation up to 7 days and after the second virus inoculation up to 150 days. In the meantime, the contents of cardiac ET-1 and ANP were reduced. Comparison the myocarditis mice treated with Perindopril (0.44 mg/kg/day), an ACE inhibitor, shows that Astragalus achieved a similar effect on survival rate, SERCA2 and ET system. These results indicated that the beneficial effects of Astragalus and Perindopril for treating viral myocarditis might be partly mediated by preserving the functions of SERCA 2 activity and ET system.", 
    "537": "Arterial hypertension (AH), either primary or secondary, is an important issue in childhood for its short- and long-term cardiovascular morbidity. Renal diseases are the most frequent causes of AH in children, but essential hypertension can also be detected early in life. It is important for blood pressure (BP) to be checked regularly (at least once every 5 years) in healthy children and adolescents and every year in those belonging to at-risk categories (family history of AH, low birth weight, obesity, etc). In children, AH is defined as BP recorded in three non-consecutive measurements with an appropriate device and cuff size > or = 95th centile for age, gender and height. Ambulatory BP monitoring is a valuable diagnostic tool and once AH is confirmed, a specific primary cause should always be ruled out (renovascular, cardiac, vascular, endocrine, pharmacologic, other). In case of border-line or significant AH (between 90th and 99th centile) a non-pharmacological treatment should be considered, whereas severe hypertension (>99th centile for height and age) will require pharmacological treatment (Diuretics, Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors, Angiotensin Receptor Blockers, beta - and Calcium blockers).", 
    "538": "Although angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are well-established drugs in the treatment of hypertension, they are not supposed to be sufficient in the inhibition of aldosterone formation. The present study analyzes the effect of aldosterone receptor antagonist, spironolactone and ACE inhibitor, captopril on nitric oxide (NO) and S-nitrosothiol formation in the kidney of N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME)-treated rats. Male Wistar rats were divided into six groups: (1) controls, (2) L-NAME (40 mg/kg/day), (3) spironolactone (200 mg/kg/day), (4) captopril (100 mg/kg/day), (5) L-NAME+spironolactone, and (6) L-NAME+captopril. After 4 weeks, NO synthase (NOS) activity, protein expression of endothelial NOS, inducible NOS and concentration of thiol and S-nitrosothiol groups were determined in the kidney. Besides the increase in systolic blood pressure (by 32%) and the decrease in NOS activity (by 37%), L-NAME treatment lowered the concentration of thiols (by 32%) and S-nitrosothiols (by 36%) in the renal tissue. Simultaneous treatment with spironolactone preserved NOS activity and S-nitrosothiols on the control level, whereas captopril did not affect these parameters modified by L-NAME treatment. Moreover, spironolactone increased expression of endothelial NOS protein without affecting inducible NOS protein expression. In conclusion, both captopril and spironolactone prevented L-NAME-induced hypertension and the decline of the antioxidant potential of the kidney tissue. However, only spironolactone improved NOS activity which led to the S-nitrosothiols formation. Both NO itself and S-nitrosothiols may contribute to the preventive effect of spironolactone against development of L-NAME-induced hypertension.", 
    "539": "Declining kidney function predicts increasing cardiovascular risk in people with hypertension. Microalbuminuria is a marker for cardiovascular risk and declining kidney function. Agents that block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), notably angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), reduce proteinuria and microalbuminuria, lower blood pressure and slow the progression of proteinuric kidney disease. Evidence is accumulating that the combination of an ACE inhibitor and an ARB is the optimal means of RAAS blockade in this setting, slowing the progression of nephropathy independently of blood pressure lowering to a greater degree than can be achieved using maximum approved doses of either agent alone. However, the emerging therapeutic potential of ACE inhibitor/ARB combination therapy in hypertensive kidney disease requires further characterization. The Irbesartan in the Management of PROteinuric patients at high risk for Vascular Events trial aims to determine definitively whether the combination therapy of an ARB, irbesartan and an ACE inhibitor, ramipril, is more effective than ramipril alone in reducing the urinary albumin excretion rate in patients at high cardiovascular risk with hypertension and proteinuria or microalbuminuria.",

The aim of this article is to describe the experience with neonatal arterial hypertension, in newborns with nephro-urological malformations, in a tertiary care referral Nursery, in a period of 4 years. Newborn medical records from the Nursery Annex to the Maternity of Hospital das Clinicas, School of Medicine, University of Sao Paulo, with the diagnosis of nephro-urological malformations and systemic arterial hypertension (SAH) at hospital discharge, in a period from January 1999 to January 2003, were retrospectively analysed. Among 10.278 live newborns in the studied period, 15 (0.15%) newborns were compatible with our inclusion criteria. Of these 15 newborns, 12 (80%) were male and three were premature (20%). In relation to aetiology, 13 (87%) showed urological malformations, 1 (6%) chronic renal insufficiency secondary to kidney dysplasia and one (6%) autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease. SAH control was achieved with monotherapy in eight patients (53%), five patients (33%) needed an association of two drugs (calcium-channel blocker and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor), one child used three types of antihypertensive drugs (calcium-channel blocker, ACE inhibitor and hydrochlorothiazide) for pressoric control and one child's blood pressure (BP) was controlled exclusively by peritoneal dialysis. The incidence of nephro-urological malformations in our service during the studied period was 0.89%. SAH incidence among these newborns was 19%. Our data reinforce previous studies pointing to the necessity to consider children with nephro-urological malformations as a risk group for SAH, who should have the BP evaluated since the neonatal period.", 
    "541": "Hypertrophy of left ventricular myocardium observed in 15-20% of patients with arterial hypertension is an independent factor which elevates considerably risk of complications of hypertension (ischemic heart disease, chronic heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias). Regression of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) at the background of hypotensive therapy is associated with additional lowering of cardiovascular risk. This should be taken into consideration in selection of a hypotensive preparation. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) are believed to have most pronounced ability to cause reverse development of LVH. It has been shown in recently finished PIXEL trial that administration of fixed combination of ACEI perindopril and diuretic indapamide reduced LVH more effectively than monotherapy with high doses of ACEI enalapril and provided better blood pressure control. Therefore in a patient with hypertension and LVH it is expedient to consider combined therapy with ACEI and diuretic including use of their fixed combinations as treatment of choice.",

During 12-month therapy with combination of perindopril and indapamide target blood pressure (<140/90) was achieved in 74.4% of patients, during monotherapy with enalapril--in 27.3% of patients. Significant decrease of left ventricular myocardial mass index (LVMMI) with combination therapy was observed by 6th month of treatment (from 260 to 234 g), with monotherapy within same period of time--from 267 to 260 g. As a result of 12 months therapy of patients with I-II degree of hypertension with perindopril and indapamide LVMMI decreased by 17.5% while monotherapy with enalapril was associated with 5.6% decrease of LVMMI. Lowering of LVMMI occurred mainly at the account of decrease of left ventricular wall thickness.",

Ramipril was used as internal standard (IS). The extraction of perindopril, perindoprilat and ramipril from the plasma involved treatment with phosphoric acid followed by solid phase extraction (SPE) using hydrophilic lipophilic balance HLB cartridge. The SPE eluate without drying were analyzed by LC-MS/MS, equipped with turbo ion spray (TIS) source, operating in the negative ion and selective reaction monitoring (SRM) acquisition mode to quantify perindopril and perindoprilat in human plasma. The total chromatographic run time was 1.5 min with retention time for perindopril, perindoprilat and ramipril at 0.33, 0.35 and 0.30 min. The developed method was validated in human plasma matrix, with a sensitivity of 0.5 ng/ml (CV, 7.67%) for perindopril and 0.3 ng/ml (CV, 4.94%) for perindoprilat. This method was extensively validated for its accuracy, precision, recovery, stability studies and matrix effect especially because the pattern of elution of all the analytes appears as flow injection elution. Sample preparation by this method yielded extremely clean extracts with very good and consistent mean recoveries; 78.29% for perindopril, 76.32% for perindoprilat and 77.72% for IS. The response of the LC-MS/MS method for perindopril and perindoprilat was linear over the range 0.5-350.0 ng/ml for perindopril and 0.3-40 ng/ml for perindoprilat with correlation coefficient, r>/=0.9998 and 0.9996, respectively. The method was successfully applied for bioequivalence studies in human subjects samples with 4 mg immediate release (IR) formulations.",

    "562": "It has been reported that matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) disrupts basement membrane and increases vascular permeability. MMP-9 therefore might participate in the pathogenesis of severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). Captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, could reduce MMP-9 expression. However, the effect of captopril on the outcome of SAP is not ascertained. The aim of this study was to determine whether captopril attenuates the severity of SAP by reducing MMP-9 expression. Thirty Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 3 groups (n = 10 for each). Rats were given intraperitoneal injection of saline (SAP group) or captopril (4 mg/kg) (treated group), and then given retrograde infusion of 5% sodium taurocholate (1.5 ml/kg) into the pancreatic duct under laparotomy to induce SAP. One group of rats, injected with saline, underwent only sham operation (Control). Experimental samples were collected at 24 hrs after the induction of SAP or sham operation. Various markers of severity of SAP, such as serum levels of amylase and trypsinogen activation peptide and the vascular permeability, were increased in rats with SAP, but were significantly decreased in captopril-treated rats (p < 0.01). Likewise, the serum MMP-9 levels and expression levels of pancreatic tissue MMP-9 were significantly higher in rats with SAP than those in captopril-treated rats and control rats (p < 0.01 for both parameters), but showed no difference between captopril-treated and control rats. These results suggest that captopril may attenuate vascular permeability by reducing MMP-9 expression in SAP, thereby ameliorating severity of the disease. The use of captopril might become a new therapeutic agent for SAP.",

We characterized the safety profile and toxicity of escalating doses of CGS 35601 over a 20-day period in chronically instrumented, unrestrained, conscious, male, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Once instrumented with an arterial catheter, the SHR were placed in metabolic cages allowing daily assessment of hemodynamics and blood sampling for biochemical and hematological measurements. After a 7-day stabilization period, the SHR were divided into 2 groups: Gr. 1, (n = 13 to 18) receiving CGS 35601 at 0.01, 0.1, 1 and 5 mg kg(-1) day(-1) (continuous i.a. infusion) for 5 consecutive days/dose, followed by a 5-day washout; and Gr. 2, (n = 10) receiving vehicle (saline). The highest dose of CGS 35601 dose-dependently reduced MABP from 156 +/- 4 up to 94 +/- 5 mm Hg, whereas heart rate, metabolic, electrolytic, and hematological profiles, growth, diuresis, and renal activity were unaffected, and no hepatic or liver toxicities were observed. These results suggest that this novel triple VPI presents no safety concerns at this stage and may become of interest for the treatment of hypertension and other cardiovascular disorders. Long-term chronic experiments are needed to assess possible angioedema and increases in vascular permeability.",

However, recent data show that the rate of ACEI prescriptions in West Virginia Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with heart failure is not increasing. Data from the charts of patients who were discharged from 44 acute care hospitals during 2000 and 2001 were obtained, and these data were matched with current beneficiary data to determine if and when the patient died subsequent to the hospitalization of record. We examined data from 5,144 patients with heart failure for whom we had information on ACEI use, comorbidities, and contraindications, in addition to basic demographics. Patients who received angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) were excluded. Of these patients, 863 were eligible for ACEls, and 716 (83%) were discharged on an ACEI. Logistic regression showed that being discharged on an ACEI had a significant negative association with mortality one year later (P = .0009), reducing mortality in patients with heart failure by about one third.", 
    "565": "Arterial wall injury caused by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) triggers transient platelet activation and mural thrombosis; these effects are superimposed on the preexisting platelet hyperreactivity associated with underlying atherothrombosis. Platelet activation has been implicated in the major complications of PCI: acute and subacute thrombosis and restenosis. Antithrombotic and anticoagulant therapy minimizes thrombotic complications after PCI. Aspirin plus a thienopyridine (ticlopidine or clopidogrel) is more effective than aspirin plus heparin and extended warfarin therapy in preventing periprocedural ischemic events and subsequent stent thrombosis and results in less major and minor bleeding. Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel (the preferred thienopyridine because of its superior hematologic safety) is recommended for at least 4 weeks to prevent subacute stent thrombosis with bare-metal stents and 3 to 6 months to prevent late-stent thrombosis with drug-eluting stents. Coronary atherothrombosis is a diffuse vascular disease, and reduction of the risk of future ischemic events requires strategies that extend beyond the focal treatment of stenotic lesions. Optimal long-term care after PCI requires aggressive systemic pharmacotherapy (antiplatelet agents, statins, beta-blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme Inhibitors) in conjunction with therapeutic lifestyle changes (smoking cessation, weight reduction, dietary measures, and exercise). In this context, dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin plus clopidogrel) is recommended for at least 12 months after PCI for prophylaxis of future atherothrombotic events.",

Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and prostaglandin synthesis inhibition along with supportive albumin infusion therapy, with or without unilateral nephrectomy, has allowed management of the disease without dialysis until transplantation in some cases of congenital nephrotic syndrome. Reported here is a case of heterozygous NPHS1 mutation, with normal NPHS2 gene structure, presenting during prenatal screening and developing nephrotic syndrome within days of birth. The patient has responded well to very low doses of ACE inhibitors and indomethacin alone. This case illustrates the importance of an initial trial of conservative medical therapy in milder presentations of the congenital nephrotic syndrome, especially given the current limitations of diagnostic testing and our inadequate knowledge of the complete spectrum of disorders of podocyte proteins.", 
    "571": "The incidence of pediatric hypertension (HTN) is increasing, mainly due to an increase in primary (essential) HTN, or PH. There are only a limited number of studies assessing the characteristics and treatment efficacy of PH versus secondary HTN (SH). We conducted a retrospective analysis of 158 pediatric patients (mean age: 10.8 years; sex ratio: 51.1% female, 48.9% male) with HTN of whom 34.4% had PH and 65.6% had SH. The vast majority were either African-American or Caucasian. Among all patients, therapy induced a significant decrease in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) (both p<0.0001). SBP (p<0.0001) and DBP (p=0.002) declined significantly in PH patients. PH and SH patients with a body mass index (BMI) >95th percentile (%) had a significantly higher post-therapy SBP (both p<0.05) than those with a BMI <95th%. SBP declined similarly in PH patients treated with calcium-channel blockers (CCB) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI). DBP declined only in PH patients treated with ACEI. SBP and DBP (both p<0.0001) declined significantly in SH patients. Post-therapy BP was similar in SH patients treated with either CCB or ACEI. Post-therapy SBP and DBP were significantly lower in SH patients than in PH patients; moreover, therapy induced a greater decline in SBP and DBP in the SH patients. Compared to PH patients, SH patients were twofold more likely to achieve a SBP less than the 95th% after therapy. We conclude that (1) significant lowering of BP with either CCB or ACEI is achievable in most children with HTN, and (2) SH patients respond better to therapy than those with PH.", 
    "572": "Patients with left ventricular dysfunction who are undergoing major noncardiac vascular surgery are at increased risk of adverse postoperative events. We sought to evaluate whether perioperative medication use, including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta-blockers, statins, and aspirin, was associated with a reduced incidence of postoperative in-hospital mortality in these high-risk patients. The study enrolled 511 patients with left ventricular dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction <30%) who were undergoing major noncardiac vascular surgery. Cardiac risk factors and medication use were noted before surgery. Preoperative dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) was performed to identify patients with stress-induced myocardial ischemia. The end point was postoperative in-hospital mortality. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the relation between perioperative medication use and mortality. The mean age of the study population was 64 +/- 11 years, and 75% were men. Perioperative use of ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, statins, and aspirin was recorded in 215 (48%), 139 (27%), 107 (21%), and 125 patients (24%), respectively. Stress-induced myocardial ischemia occurred in 82 patients (16%). Sixty-four patients (13%) died. Perioperative use of ACE inhibitors (odds ratio [OR], 0.33; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.12-0.91), beta-blockers (OR, 0.03; 95% CI, 0.01-0.26), statins (OR, 0.06; 95% CI, 0.01-0.53), and aspirin (OR, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.03-0.55), was significantly associated with a reduced incidence of mortality, after adjusting for cardiac risk factors and DSE results. In conclusion, the present study showed that the perioperative use of ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, statins, and aspirin is independently associated with a reduced incidence of in-hospital mortality in patients with left ventricular dysfunction who are undergoing major noncardiac vascular surgery.",

    "577": "It is now well known that congestive heart failure (CHF) is invariably associated with cardiac hypertrophy, and changes in the shape and size of cardiomyocytes (cardiac remodeling) are considered to explain cardiac dysfunction in CHF. However, the mechanisms responsible for the transition of cardiac hypertrophy to heart failure are poorly understood. Several lines of evidence both from various experimental models of CHF and from patients with different types of CHF have indicated that the functions of different subcellular organelles such as extracellular matrix, sarcolemma, sarcoplasmic reticulum, myofibrils, mitochondria, and nucleus are defective. Subcellular abnormalities for protein contents, gene expression, and enzyme activities in the failing heart become evident as a consequence of prolonged hormonal imbalance, metabolic derangements, and cation maldistribution. In particular, the occurrence of oxidative stress, development of intracellular Ca2+ overload, activation of proteases and phospholipases, and alterations in cardiac gene expression result in changes in the biochemical composition, molecular structure, and function of different subcellular organelles (subcellular remodeling). Not only does subcellular remodeling appear to be intimately involved in the transition of cardiac hypertrophy to heart failure, the mismatching of the function of different subcellular organelles leads to the development of cardiac dysfunction. Although blockade of the renin-angiotensin system, sympathetic nervous system, and various other hormonal actions have been reported to produce beneficial effects on cardiac remodeling and heart dysfunction in CHF, the actions of various cardiac drugs on subcellular remodeling have not been examined extensively. Some recent studies have indicated that both the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists attenuate changes in sarcolemma, sarcoplasmic reticulum, and myofibril enzyme activities, protein contents, and gene expression, and partly improve cardiac function in the failing hearts. It is suggested that subcellular remodeling is an excellent target for the development of improved drug therapy for CHF. Furthermore, extensive studies should investigate the effects of different agents individually or in combination on reverse subcellular remodeling, cardiac remodeling, and cardiac dysfunction in various experimental models of CHF.", 
    "578": "Several studies have shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers are useful in the treatment of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic heart failure, and some types of nephropathy. In this context, dual renin-angiotensin system blockade with both angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers may be more effective than treatment with each agent alone. Many clinical trials have demonstrated the beneficial effect of this combined treatment on proteinuria, hypertension, heart failure, and cardiovascular events. Moreover, these studies demonstrated that dual renin-angiotensin system blockade is generally safe and well tolerated. Long-term studies are under way to confirm these effects and also investigate the effectiveness of dual renin-angiotensin system blockade on cerebrovascular disease and prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus. These studies are expected to define the optimal use of combination treatment in everyday clinical practice. This review considers the most important clinical trials that evaluated the effect of dual renin-angiotensin system blockade on blood pressure, heart failure, and renal function.", 
    "579": "In a double-blind, outcome trial conducted in hypertensive patients randomized to chlorthalidone (C), amlodipine (A), lisinopril (L), or doxazosin (D), the alpha-adducin Gly460Trp polymorphism was typed (n=36 913). Mean follow-up was 4.9 years. Relative risks (RRs) of chlorthalidone versus other treatments were compared between genotypes (Gly/Gly+Gly/Trp versus Trp/Trp). Primary outcome was coronary heart disease (CHD). Coronary heart disease incidence did not differ among treatments or genotypes nor was there any interaction between treatment and genotype (P=0.660). Subgroup analyses indicated that Trp allele carriers had greater CHD risk with C versus A+L in women (RR=1.31) but not men (RR=0.91) with no RR gender differences for non-carriers (gender-gene-treatment interaction, P=0.002). The alpha-adducin gene is not an important modifier of antihypertensive treatment on cardiovascular risk, but women Trp allele carriers may have increased CHD risk if treated with C versus A or L. This must be confirmed to have implications for hypertension treatment.", 
    "580": "This study was designed to study the effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) following treatment with trandolapril (0.3 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) on carotid arterial responsiveness in normotensive Wistar rats. Carotid arteries were obtained from control or trandolapril-treated animals and mounted in an isolated organ bath. Reactivity to angiotensin II (Ang II), phenylephrine (Phe) and KCl was studied. Agonist concentration-response curves were constructed in either the absence or presence of the endothelium or after incubation with L-NAME (10(-6) M), HOE140 (10(-7) M) or indomethacin (10(-5) M). Trandolapril treatment decreased the Ang II and Phe potencies in carotid arteries, but did not affect the maximal response. The KCl responses (potency and Emax) were similar in both control and trandolapril-treated arteries. The absence of endothelium increased the response to both agonists in control and trandolapril-treated arteries; however, the inhibitory component from the endothelial layer of the Phe response was greater in trandolapril-treated animals than in control animals. The presence of L-NAME or HOE140 abolished the changes in the potency values of trandolapril-treated animals. The presence of indomethacin did not change the effect of trandolapril on the potency values of both agonists. We conclude that trandolapril treatment decreased the carotid arterial reactivity in normotensive rats and that this effect is endothelium-dependent. Furthermore, the involvement of B(2)-receptors and NO production, but not of prostaglandins, is suggested in this mechanism.", 
    "581": "Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) is synthesized during the methylation of protein arginine residues by protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMT) and is released during proteolysis. ADMA is a competitive inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase and may decrease NO availability. ADMA is eliminated by renal excretion or is metabolized by dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH) to citruline and dimethylamine. Two other endogenous methylarginines are also synthesized by PRMT: N-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) and symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA). L-NMMA inhibits NO synthase but its concentrations in circulation are much lower than ADMA whereas SDMA is inactive. Plasma concentration of ADMA is markedly increased in patients with chronic renal failure and moderately increased in patients with many other diseases including hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, hyperhomocysteinemia and heart failure. The increased concentration of ADMA is positively correlated with markers of atherosclerosis, such as carotid artery intima-media thickness and has a predictive value for acute cardiovascular events in prospective studies. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonists, vitamin E and, according to some studies, estrogens used in hormonal replacement therapy reduce plasma ADMA concentration, which may contribute to their beneficial effect on NO synthesis and endothelial function. However, in some states associated with excess of NO, such as septic shock or excitotoxic neuronal injury ADMA may be protective by limiting toxic effect of high concentrations of NO. This article reviews the effect of pharmacotherapy on ADMA metabolism and its possible clinical implications.", 
    "582": "Hypertension and diabetes are associated with an increased arterial stiffness. A direct blood pressure-independent effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors on arterial stiffness has never been unequivocally demonstrated. In this mechanistic study, we used an experimental design in which patients responding to 1 month treatment with 4 mg perindopril were randomized double-blind to either 4 mg perindopril or 8 mg perindopril for 6 months. We determined carotid distensibility with echotracking and applanation tonometry at baseline and after the 7-month treatment period in 57 essential hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes (age 63+/-7 years). We monitored ambulatory blood pressure at baseline and after treatment. After 7 months treatment, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure significantly decreased, with no significant difference between 4 mg and 8 mg perindopril. Carotid distensibility increased more after 8 mg perindopril compared with 4 mg perindopril (8 mg: from 13.1+/-5.9 to 16.0+/-6.7 kPa(-1)x10(-3); 4 mg: from 13.2+/-5.2 to 12.7+/-5.9 kPa(-1)x10(-3); ANOVA, dose-period interaction, P<0.05). Carotid internal diameter and elastic modulus were significantly lower after 8 mg perindopril compared with 4 mg perindopril, independent of blood pressure reduction. These results indicate a dose-dependent and blood pressure-independent reduction in carotid stiffness under chronic treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. They suggest that arterial distensibility was increased through an inward remodeling, leading to a reduction in wall stress, thus reducing elastic modulus. They also suggest that long-term administration of high doses (8 mg) of perindopril is required to improve carotid structure and function in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes.", 
    "583": "In heart failure lung dysfunction is frequent and is greater the greater the heart failure severity. It can be evaluated in terms of lung mechanics and gas diffusion. Indeed heart-lung interaction is related to heart dimensions and lung fluid content; furthermore heart-lung interaction is influenced by the body position. Lung diffusion is also altered in patients with chronic heart failure, and a low gas diffusion is associated with a reduced performance. During exercise, heart-lung interaction becomes more evident. Heart failure patients show an abnormal hyperventilation due to a progressively increased respiratory rate, and a lower tidal volume; hyperventilation is due to different causes including enhanced responses from chemo- and metabolo-receptors, increased CO(2) production and increased dead space ventilation. Several drugs affect the ventilatory pattern in heart failure patients: ACE-inhibitors and anti-aldosteronic drugs improve lung diffusion and ventilatory efficiency during exercise; beta-blockers reduce exercise-induced hyperventilation. Furthermore, ultrafiltration improves lung mechanics, both at rest and during exercise, through body fluid content reduction.",

In the present study, we assessed a potential renal benefit of additional aldosterone blockade with spironolactone in hypertensive diabetic patients treated with ACEI showing the phase of aldosterone escape. 3. The present clinical study was a randomized prospective study to assess difference between the clinical effects of spironolactone and furosemide. Thirty hypertensive type II diabetics (DM2) with a urinary alubumin:creatinine ratio (ACR) above 30 mg/g creatinine (showing albuminuria) and plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels above 100 pg/mL (showing mild heart failure) were treated with an ACEI (imidapril 5 mg/day) for 1 year and then randomly divided into two groups, one group receiving additional spironolactone (25 mg/day) treatment and the other receiving furosemide (20 mg/day) treatment. Blood pressure, ACR and plasma BNP levels were monitored in both groups. 4. Treatment with the ACEI reduced ACR initially but, in 1 year, ACR tended to increase. Additional spironolactone treatment progressively reduced ACR, whereas furosemide treatment did not show any effect. Plasma BNP levels were reduced by ACEI and were further reduced by additional spironolactone treatment, but not furosemide treatment. Blood pressure levels in both groups were comparable. 5. In conclusion, additional therapy with spironolactone in ACEI treatment exerts a renoprotective, as well as cardioprotective, effect in hypertensive diabetes.", 
    "585": "Over the past years, there has been an explosive increase in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and this is expected to continue, entailing associated morbidity and mortality. An increasing number of studies explore the different ways T2DM could be prevented. On-going lifestyle modifications need to be addressed. High-risk patients should be given counselling on weight loss, possibly using a low glycaemic index diet, with a target of around 7-10% over 6-12 months, as well as instruction for increasing physical activity to around 150 min of physical exercise weekly (NNT = 4-8). Moderate alcohol consumption and coffee consumption may also be of benefit (NNT = 89 and 66, respectively). Metformin (NNT = 14), acarbose (NNT = 11) and troglitazone (NNT = 6) have been shown to prevent/delay T2DM and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and statins appear to have an adjunctive role (NNT = 42 and 112, respectively). Trials with orlistat and bariatric surgery have also prevented T2DM (NNT = 36 and 6, respectively), and forthcoming treatment with GLP1 mimetics appears promising. Diabetes prevention studies should help create well-defined strategies for screening and treating high-risk populations in the real world, as prevention is our only chance to alleviate the ever growing burden of diabetes mellitus in the world.", 
    "586": "Severe pulmonary hypertension (SPH) is characterized by precapillary arteriolar lumen obliteration, dramatic right ventricular hypertrophy, and pericardial effusion. Our recently published rat model of SPH recapitulates major components of the human disease. We used this model to develop new treatment strategies for SPH. SPH in rats was induced using VEGF receptor blockade in combination with chronic hypoxia. A large variety of drugs used in this study, including anticancer drugs (cyclophosphamide and paclitaxel), the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril, the antiangiogenic agent thalidomide, and the peroxisome proliferator-actived receptor-gamma agonist PGJ2, failed to decrease mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) or right ventricular hypertrophy. In contrast, treatment of rats with established SPH with simvastatin markedly reduced mean PAP and right ventricular hypertrophy, and this reduction was associated with caspase-3 activation and pulmonary microvascular endothelial cell apoptosis. Simvastatin partially restored caveolin-1, caveolin-2, and phospho-caveolin expression in vessel walls. In rat primary pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells, simvastatin induced caspase 3 activation and Rac 1 expression while suppressing Rho A and attenuated levels of Akt and ERK phosphorylation. We conclude that simvastatin is effective in inducing apoptosis in hyperproliferative pulmonary vascular lesions and could be considered as a potential drug for treatment of human SPH.",

No established disease modifying treatments retard progression of the stenotic process. Recent insights into the pathogenesis of calcific aortic stenosis suggest that the disease mimics atherosclerosis. The natural history and progression of calcific aortic stenosis are described with particular emphasis on new and emerging medical treatments that may modify the disease process. In particular, statins and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors appear to hold promise but definitive evidence from large clinical trials is awaited.", 
    "588": "Although angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), and beta-blockers have been proved to reduce mortality in patients with heart failure post-acute myocardial infarction (AMI), studies show that these agents are consistently underused in this population. Further, morbidity and mortality remain high even when standard-of-care therapies are applied. Thus, new strategies have been sought to better counteract the maladaptive effects of neurohormonal stimulation in post-AMI heart failure. The Eplerenone Post-Acute Myocardial Infarction Heart Failure Efficacy and Survival Study (EPHESUS) demonstrated that the selective aldosterone blocker eplerenone, when used in addition to standard therapy, results in significant incremental improvements in survival and morbidity and is safe and well tolerated in this setting. Based on this, major therapeutic guidelines in the United States and Europe now strongly recommend that all eligible patients with concomitant heart failure post-AMI be treated with an aldosterone blocker in addition to an ACE inhibitor (or an ARB) and a beta-blocker. To achieve needed improvements in outcomes in this population, early and consistent initiation of these evidence-based, guideline-recommended therapies in all eligible patients is crucial.", 
    "589": "Captopril is an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) that is largely used in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Several previous studies have demonstrated that captopril exhibits a wide variety of biological activities, including an anti-inflammatory action, on which we focused our attention. The aim of the present study was to investigate the efficacy of captopril on endotoxin induced uveitis (EIU) in rats. We investigated its effect upon cellular infiltration and protein leakage, as well as on the concentration of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) in the anterior chamber. In addition, we checked its effect on activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) in iris and ciliary body (ICB) cells in vivo. EIU was induced in male Lewis rats by a footpad injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). One hour after the LPS inoculation, either 1mg/kg, 10mg/kg or 100mg/kg captopril were injected intravenously. 24h later, the aqueous humor was collected from both eyes, and the number of infiltrating cells and protein concentration in the aqueous humor were determined. Levels of TNF-alpha, PGE2, NO and MCP-1 were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. On some eyes, after enucleation, immunohistochemical staining with a monoclonal antibody against activated NF-kappaB was performed. Captopril treatment significantly decreased the inflammatory cells infiltration, the level of protein, concentrations of TNF-alpha, PGE2, NO and MCP-1 in the aqueous humor. The number of activated NF-kappaB-positive cells was lower in ICB of the rats treated with captopril 3h after the LPS injection. The present results indicate that captopril suppresses the inflammation in EIU by inhibiting the NF-kappaB-dependent pathway and the subsequent production of pro-inflammatory mediators.",

Therapy with amiodarone and therapy with implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) have developed specifically to prevent sudden death by life-threatening arrhythmias. But recently many large-scale clinical trials have proved that ICD therapy improves prognosis of patients with heart failure better than amiodarone therapy. Because ICD is not a treatment to prevent the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias, it may not necessarily improve quality of life of patients. In that respect catheter ablation may play a role in preventing life-threatening arrhythmias.",

Therefore, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) have been expected to improve the mortality and morbidity in patients with heart failure more effectively strict elimination of the effects of angiotensin II compared with angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEI). Here, we summarize the current clinical outcomes obtained from large scale trials using ARBs as a strategy of the treatment of heart failure, and discuss the pharmacological differences between ARB and ACEI and the future direction of the treatment of heart failure.", 
    "597": "Chronic heart failure (CHF) is a clinical complex showing end -stage of several cardiovascular disorders. Patients with CHF are disclosed to both of high mortality and high morbidity. Most of them repeat frequently the hospitalization. In CHF patients, neurohumoral factors such as renin -angiotensin -aldosterone systems (RAAS) are enhanced, and they result in high level of angiotensin, aldosterone and catecholamine in the cardiovascular tissue. Most of the hormones are known as cardiotoxic agent. The activated RAAS is closely linked with progression of cardiac remodeling. Thus, ACE inhibitor can block this linkage. Recently, several randomized controlled trials in large scale reveal that the ACE inhibitor is a beneficial tool for not only CHF therapy but also CHF prevention. The blocking effects by ACE inhibitor are playing a crucial role in releasing the CHF patients from several burdens.", 
    "598": "Pharmacological treatment of chronic heart failure has considerably changed according as a shift of the pathophysiological concept. During the past two decades, it became clear that neurohumoral stimulations play an important role in the progression of heart failure by promoting cardiac remodeling. Administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and beta blockers is now an essential treatment that reduces morbidity and mortality. In spite of an increase in available treatments, the prognosis of symptomatic heart failure remains to be poor. To establish newer and successful treatments, further advancement in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of heart failure will be required. Currently, several novel approaches are being tested targeting prevention of cardiac remodeling and myocardial dysfunction. Cardiomyocyte protection by hematopoietic cytokines and stem cell-based therapy may have a promising therapeutic potential.",

To achieve this goal, new pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches have been developed. ACE inhibitor - and beta-blocker-treatment added to the standard therapy has been established to improve the prognosis, and ICD, cardiac resynchronization treatment (CRT) with biventricular pacing and LV assist device also contribute to the advances in the therapeutic progress. However, recent clinical trials for the new drugs which antagonize the endothelin receptors and TNF receptors failed to demonstrate the benefit of these new drugs. Establishment of the therapeutic strategies for treatment of diastolic heart failure is also another problem to be solved.",

In a prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded-end point trial, patients (> or =60 years of age) with predominantly systolic hypertension received telmisartan 40-80 mg or amlodipine 5-10 mg for 8 weeks, before the addition of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 12.5 mg for a further 6 weeks. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring showed that telmisartan plus HCTZ (n=448) and amlodipine plus HCTZ (n=424) changed systolic blood pressure for the last 6 hours of the dosing interval by -18.3 and -17.4 mm Hg, respectively (p=0.2520). Over the 24-hour period, telmisartan plus HCTZ was superior (-19.3 and -17.2 mm Hg, respectively; p=0.001) and provided higher systolic control rates (65.9% and 58.3%, respectively; p=0.0175). Adverse events (41.2% and 53.7%, respectively) and discontinuations (5.0% and 11.3%, respectively) were lower (p<0.0001) with telmisartan than with amlodipine, mainly due to peripheral edema (1.2% and 24.3%, respectively).",

Older-generation antihypertensive drugs (central-acting, beta blockers, diuretics) negatively affect erectile function, while newer-generation agents (calcium antagonists, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) seem to have neutral effects. Preliminary data with the latest drugs (angiotensin receptor blockers) point to a beneficial effect on erectile function. Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, can be safely and effectively administered to hypertensive patients (even when on multiple-agent antihypertensive therapy), with a caution regarding alpha blockers. In the case when erectile dysfunction is considered to result from antihypertensive therapy, the treating physician may either add phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors or substitute current treatment with angiotensin receptor blockers.",

Many factors are now implicated in the development of hypertensive vascular disease, and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) appears to be one of the most significant. Angiotensin II, the principal effector peptide of the RAAS, has far-reaching effects on vascular structure, growth and fibrosis, and is a key regulator of vascular remodeling and inflammation. Reactive oxygen species and a network of signaling pathways mediate angiotensin II and cellular mechanisms that promote remodeling and inflammation. The involvement of aldosterone in vessel-wall and myocardial remodeling has also come under intensive research scrutiny.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers, and aldosterone antagonists have had a substantial impact on reducing mortality and morbidity in patients with HF and low left ventricular ejection fraction. These treatments delayed the progression toward advanced intractable HF but did not arrest progressive worsening of the disease. Patients on optimal medical therapy continued to deteriorate, albeit at a much slower pace, ultimately requiring further intervention. This gave rise to a host of device-based therapies that emerged in recent years to address this unmet need. Device therapies such as cardiac resynchronization, the CorCap cardiac support device (Acorn Cardiovascular, Inc., St. Paul, MN), and the OPTIMIZER System (Impulse Dynamics USA, Inc., Orangeburg, NY) are a few examples. This review addresses the progress made to date in the development and implementation of cardiac contractility modulation (CCM) as a device-based therapy for the treatment of patients with advanced HF. Treatment of patients with HF using CCM electrical signals is at present an investigational form of therapy.", 
    "636": "The resistance to thrombolytic agents and delays in reperfusion occur in more than 30% after acute myocardial infarction. This may play an important role in the unsuccessful recanalization after thrombolytic therapy. The aim of this study is to assess the clinical and biochemical markers of reperfusion after different types of thrombolytic therapy and to find out the relationship between PAI-1 and ACE serum levels and the short-term outcome. Pretreatment ACE and PAI-1 plasma levels of 184 patients with acute myocardial infarction, treated with thrombolytic therapy were determined. Failure of thrombolysis was considered when reperfusion was delayed as assessed by noninvasive reperfusion criteria, reinfarction, and impaired left ventricular function. High plasma level of ACE (> 50 U/L), PAI-1 (> 43 ng/ml) and both was found in 57, 108 and 32 patients respectively. Subjects with high ACE plasma levels were characterized by impaired LV systolic function (79.0% vs. 75.0%), new Q-wave (88.4% vs. 74.2%), less reperfusion arrhythmia (19.3% vs. 22.8%) and prolonged hospitalization (70% vs. 66%) but no statistical significance was observed. High enzymes levels of PAI-1 were observed with higher incidence of anterior myocardial infarction (50.0% vs. 41.0%), lesser ST segment resolution (65.6% vs. 58.8%), reinfarction (6.3% vs. 5.9%), and impaired LV systolic function (90.6% vs. 76.0%), and prolonged hospitalization (70.4% vs. 63.4). There was a statistically significant difference between thrombolytic agents in the presence of high ACE regarding hospital overstay (p = 0.02). While the presence of high PAI-1 was significantly affect the degree of ST-segment resolution (p = 0.03).",

Nevertheless, there is a lack of clear and concise comparative study of their effects on the modulation of cardiomyocyte morphology and function. Here, we assessed the tissue-protective actions of 2 of these drugs, the calcium channel blocker lacidipine (3 mg/kg/day) and the angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitor enalapril (10 mg/kg/day) in vivo, after 8 weeks of treatment of 12-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats, as well as in vitro, after short-term (4 min) application to isolated cardiomyocytes. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) was compared at organ, tissue, and single-cell level. Our data showed that both drugs prevented the LVH of 20-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats, but only lacidipine significantly decreased the cardiomyocyte size. Similarly, the single-cell contractility was significantly lowered in lacidipine-treated rats only. The effect of lacidipine was initiated shortly after exposure to the drug in a dose-dependent manner at 0.5 Hz, as well as at 2 Hz, with EC(50) of 10(-7) mol/L.

    "646": "Observational studies have shown that the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors is associated with the maintenance of greater muscle strength and physical performance in older subjects. However, the mechanism that underlies these beneficial effects remains poorly understood. Because ACE inhibitors block the production of angiotensin II, which is a potent inhibitor of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) production, it was hypothesized that treatment with ACE inhibitors is associated with higher levels of IGF-1. This hypothesis was tested in 745 subjects (417 women, 328 men) enrolled in the Invecchiare in Chianti study. Of these, 160 were receiving ACE inhibitors. The association between ACE inhibitor use and serum IGF-1 was tested by linear regression models. After adjusting for multiple potential confounders, serum levels of total IGF-1 were significantly higher in participants receiving ACE inhibitors (mean +/- SD 129.0 +/- 56.1 ng/ml) compared with the rest of the study population (mean +/- SD 116.5 +/- 54.8 ng/ml) (p <0.001). Participants with short (<3 years) and long (3 to 9 years) treatment durations had higher serum IGF-1 levels than participants who were not receiving ACE inhibitor treatment, but the difference was statistically significant only for the short-duration group (p <0.05). In conclusion, in older subjects, treatment with ACE inhibitors for <3 years is associated with significantly higher levels of IGF-1. This may be 1 of the mechanisms by which ACE inhibitors might slow the decreases in muscle strength and physical function that are often observed in older subjects.",

We then identified a comparator group of patients not using fibrates, matching them to fibrate users based on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglyceride (TG) levels, age, sex, and year of HDL-C and TG measurement. Subjects were followed until a CVD hospitalization, termination from the health plan, or December 31, 2003, whichever came first.

The patients who had newly initiated fibrate pharmacotherapy had low baseline HDL-C levels (mean, 37.4 mg/dL) and very high TG levels (617 mg/dL). The 2 groups were similar overall, with the only significant differences between fibrate users and nonfibrate controls being a greater prevalence of diabetes (37.7% vs 34.3%, respectively; P=0.040) and greater use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin-receptor blockers (56.6% vs 51.6%, respectively; P=0.003), beta-blockers (53.7% vs 49.0%; P=0.006), calcium channel blockers (25.1% vs 20.9%; P=0.004), and niacin (11.7% vs 7.4%; P<0.001).

    "656": "There is growing evidence indicating that oxidative stress is a key contributor to the pathogenesis and progression of Parkinson's disease. The brain, and particularly the basal ganglia, possesses a local rennin-angiotensin system. Angiotensin activates NAD(P)H-dependent oxidases, which are a major intracellular source of superoxide, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) have shown antioxidant properties. We treated mice with MPTP and the ACEI captopril to study the possible neuroprotective and antioxidant effects of the latter on the dopaminergic system. Pre-treatment with captopril induced a significant reduction in the MPTP-induced loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and a significant reduction in the loss of dopaminergic terminals in the striatum. Furthermore, captopril reduced the MPTP-induced increase in the levels of major oxidative stress indicators (i.e. lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation) in the ventral midbrain and the striatum. Captopril did not reduce striatal MPP(+) levels, MAO-B activity or dopamine transporter activity, which may reduce MPTP neurotoxicity. Our results suggest that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may be useful for treatment of Parkinson's disease, and that further investigation should focus on the neuroprotective capacity of these compounds.",

However, whether the beneficial effect of enalapril is mediated in part through endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) has yet to be elucidated. This study investigated the role of the CD26/dipeptidylpeptidase IV (DPP IV) system in enalapril-modulated EPC mobilization. C57 BL/6 mice were divided into control and enalapril-treated groups. Peripheral EPCs were enumerated before and after ischemic stress. CD26/DPP IV activity and stroma-derived factor-1alpha (SDF-1alpha) levels were measured in the blood and the bone marrow. In response to ischemic stress, the enalapril group displayed a significant increase in circulating EPCs (with a 3.6-fold increase of sca-1+KDR+ cells and a 2.2-fold increase of c-kit+CD31+ cells versus controls at 12 h). Enalapril also caused a sixfold increase in the contribution of bone marrow-derived EPCs to the ischemia-induced neovascularization. In the bone marrow, enalapril did not alter CD26+ cell numbers; however, it did amplify DPP IV activity. In the blood, through the anti-inflammatory effect, enalapril significantly decreased CD26+ cell numbers, leading to a decrease in total DPP IV activity. These phenomena were associated with a lower SDF-1alpha concentration in the bone marrow but higher in the blood in the enalapril group, compared to the controls. All these findings were not demonstrated without ischemic stress. The effect of enalapril on EPC mobilization could be substantially blocked by Diprotin-A, a DDP IV antagonist. This study demonstrates that one of the pleiotropic effects of enalapril on the cardiovascular system involves the modulation of circulating EPC numbers via the CD26/DPP IV system, which may serve as a potential target for mobilizing EPCs for therapeutic purposes.",

Thirty-six children fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The mean age was 13.9+/-4.4 yr; the mean time after renal transplantation was 2.7+/-2.4 yr (0.5-10.1). Hypertension was defined as a mean ambulatory BP > or =95th centile for healthy children and/or requiring antihypertensive drugs. Hypertension was regarded as controlled if the mean ambulatory BP was <95th centile in children already on antihypertensive drugs, or uncontrolled if the mean ambulatory BP was > or =95th centile in treated children. Hypertension was present in 89% of children. Seventeen children (47%) had controlled hypertension, and 14 (39%) had uncontrolled hypertension. One child (3%) had untreated hypertension, and only four children (11%) showed normal BP without antihypertensive drugs. The efficacy of hypertensive control was 55% (17 of 31 children on antihypertensive drugs had a BP<95th centile), i.e. 45% of treated children still had hypertension. Children with uncontrolled hypertension had significantly higher cyclosporine doses (6.1 vs. 4.3 mg/kg/day, p=0.01) and tacrolimus levels (9.2 vs. 6.1 microg/L, p<0.05), and there was a tendency toward use of lower number of antihypertensive drugs (2.0 vs. 1.5 drugs/patient, p=0.06) and lower use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (7 vs. 35%, p=0.09) and diuretics (29 vs. 59%, p=0.14) than in children with controlled hypertension. In conclusion, nearly 90% of our children after renal transplantation are hypertensive and the control of hypertension is unsatisfactorily low. The control of hypertension could be improved by increasing the number of prescribed antihypertensive drugs, especially ACE inhibitors, and diuretics, or by using higher doses of currently used antihypertensives.",

Live bacteria were recovered from the subcutaneous perichamber and abdominal spaces (spreading), and from the blood (disseminating) of infected mice.

Death from a non CV disease was also studied for comparison. Revascularization procedure was defined as percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). The exposure to cardioprotective drugs was defined as the number of cardioprotective drug classes (Acetylsalicylic Acid (ASA), Beta-Blockers, Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors, Statins) claimed within the index period (first 30 days after the index hospitalization).

For patients without revascularization, the CV survival rate increases with the number of cardioprotective drug classes claimed. Finally, Cox proportional hazard models, regression tree and logistic regression analyses all revealed that the absence of revascularization and, to a lower extent, absence of cardioprotective drugs were major predictors for CV death, even after adjusting for age, gender and comorbidity.",

Seventy hypertensive type II diabetic individuals were treated with three antihypertensive strategies in a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy design. Blood pressure was titrated to levels below 130/85 mm Hg or a decrease in systolic pressure of 10% with a diastolic pressure below 85 mm Hg. After titration, patients were treated for 12 months.

About 70% reached target blood pressures, with the median use of three antihypertensive drugs. Left ventricular mass index and all estimates of arterial stiffness showed significant improvement after 12 months: that is, LVM index (-11 g/m(2); -8%); carotid distensibility coefficient (DC; +2.8 x 10(-3) kPa(-1); +27%), compliance coefficient (CC; +0.13 mm2/kPa; +21%) and elastic modulus (-0.19 kPa; -16%); femoral DC (+1.6 x 10(-3) kPa(-1); +50%) and CC (+0.08 mm2/kPa; +26%); brachial DC (+2.1 x 10(-3) kPa(-1); +39%) and CC (+0.03 mm2/kPa; +27%) and total systemic arterial compliance (+0.29 ml/mm Hg; +16%).

    "673": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a homolog of ACE, which is not blocked by ACE inhibitors. High amounts of ACE2 are present in the proximal tubule, and ACE2 catalyzes generation of angiotensin 1-7 (Ang-(1-7)) by this segment. Ang-(1-7) binds to a receptor distinct from the AT1 or AT2 Ang II receptor, identified as the mas receptor. We studied the effects of Ang-(1-7) on Ang II-mediated cell signaling pathways in proximal tubule. In primary cultures of rat proximal tubular cells, activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) was detected by immunoblotting, in the presence or absence of agonists/antagonists. Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Ang II (5 min, 10(-7) M) stimulated phosphorylation of the three MAPK (p38, extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK 1/2), and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)). While incubation of proximal tubular cells with Ang-(1-7) alone did not significantly affect MAPK phosphorylation, Ang-(1-7) (10(-7) M) completely inhibited Ang II-stimulated phosphorylation of p38, ERK 1/2, and JNK. This inhibitory effect was reversed by the Ang-(1-7) receptor antagonist, D-Ala7-Ang-(1-7). Ang II significantly increased production of TGF-beta1 in proximal tubular cells, an effect that was partly inhibited by Ang-(1-7). Ang-(1-7) had no significant effect on cyclic 3',5'-adenosine monophosphate production in these cells. In summary, Ang-(1-7) inhibits Ang II-stimulated MAPK phosphorylation in proximal tubular cells. Generation of Ang-(1-7) by proximal tubular ACE2 could thereby serve a protective role by counteracting the effects of locally generated Ang II.",

After a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period, benazepril (10-20 mg/day) or imidapril (5-10 mg/day) was administered for 6 weeks to 509 patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. Polymerase chain reaction combined with restriction enzyme digestion was used to detect the polymorphism, and the patients were classified as having the TT, TC, or CC genotype. The achieved changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP) were analyzed to determine their association with genotypes at the AGT gene locus. In the total 509 patients, the TT genotype was observed in 44 patients (8.7%), the TC genotype in 214 patients (42.0%), and the CC genotype in 251 patients (49.3%). The SBP reductions in patients with the TT genotype, TC genotype, and CC genotype were -15.3+/-12.7 mmHg, -14.0+/-12.7 mmHg, and -14.4+/-12.4 mmHg, respectively (p=0.809). The DBP reductions in patients with the TT genotype, TC genotype, and CC genotype were -8.5+/-8.1 mmHg, -8.3+/-7.5 mmHg, and -8.9+/-6.6 mmHg, respectively (p=0.638). There were no significant differences in the changes in SBP or DBP after treatment among the three genotype groups.

The prevalence of ADPKD is more common than Huntington disease, haemophilia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis, myotonic dystrophy and Down syndrome combined. In recent years there have not only been advances in the understanding of the genetic and molecular events involved in ADPKD, but some diagnostic and therapeutic advances have also emerged. In the genetics area, the gene for PKD1 was localised to chromosome 16, is associated with polycystin-2 protein, and found to account for approximately 85% of patients with ADPKD. The gene for PKD2, found in chromosome 4, accounts for approximately 15% of ADPKD, and is associated with the polycystin-2 protein. While these genetic and molecular biology findings have stimulated a great deal of exciting basic research in ADPKD, therapies to decrease morbidity and mortality in ADPKD patients have yet to emerge from these findings. In contrast, the early diagnosis and treatment of hypertension with inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system have the potential to decrease or prevent left ventricular hypertrophy cardiac complications and slow the progression of the renal disease.",

Studies performed over the last decade have demonstrated that (1) angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are as effective as ACE inhibitors in reducing morbidity and mortality in cardiac failure; and (2) inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system provides beneficial effects in patients at high cardiovascular risk without cardiac failure. This review focuses on the applicability of the results of the main trials with ACE inhibitors and ARBs to the elderly population.", 
    "693": "Although elderly patients represent a rapidly growing population often requiring multiple drug treatment, the evidence of effectiveness is limited for many interventions and therapies in this age group. Only during the last 30 years has a requirement to incorporate evidence into the treatment of older subjects become part of the pre- and postmarketing regulatory process in Europe and the United States. Recently, elderly patients have been shown to benefit comparably from several treatments. These studies have supported the validity of an increasingly interventional approach to disorders common in late life. However, an important issue is the applicability of the growing body of clinical trials to 'real life' patients. This is particularly true in very old (i.e. >80 years) patients and those with significant comorbidities. We review the current evidence and controversies related to the effectiveness and safety of several therapeutic strategies in cardiovascular disease (i.e. statins, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-adrenoceptor blockers, and thrombolytic agents) and bone health (i.e. vitamin D and bisphosphonates).", 
    "694": "There is sound evidence that the cardiovascular and the renal systems are well organized in time. Mechanisms of regulation and pathophysiological events are not evenly distributed over the 24-h scale. Moreover, certain diseases may even alter the physiological circadian pattern both in the cardiovascular system and in the kidneys. This observation bares implications for drug treatment, e.g., regarding drug formulations and dosing time intervals. Pitfalls may arise from neglecting circadian phase-dependency in pharmacokinetics and in the concentration-effect relationship. Moreover, different types of drugs may be superior to others when circadian time-related symptoms are concerned. No doubt, \"time-of-day\" has to be included in our diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.", 
    "695": "Vascular damage occurring after cerebral ischemia may lead to a worse outcome in patients with ischemic stroke, as it facilitates edema formation and hemorrhagic transformation. There are several phases in the development of vascular injury (acute, subacute and chronic) and different mediators act in each one. Therapeutic options to avoid vascular injury must be focused on acting in each phase. However, even though experimental studies have demonstrated the benefit of therapeutic interventions both in the acute and chronic phases of cerebral ischemia, only the chronic phase offers a therapeutic window sufficiently wide enough to provide vascular protection in clinical practice. Several drugs including erythropoietin and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), antihypertensive (angiotensin modulators), antibiotics (minocycline) and antihyperglycemic drugs (thiazolidinediones) have been proved to provide vascular protection in patients with ischemic stroke. Anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antiapoptotic actions are responsible for the vascular protective effect related to these drugs.", 
    "696": "It is widely accepted that a high sodium intake triggers blood pressure rise. However, only one-third of the normotensive subjects were reported to show salt-sensitivity in their blood pressure. Many factors have been proposed as causes of salt-sensitive hypertension, but none of them provides a satisfactory explanation. We propose, on the basis of accumulated data, that the reduced activity of the kallikrein-kinin system in the kidney may provide this link. Renal kallikrein is secreted by the distal connecting tubular cells and all kallikrein-kinin system components are distributed along the collecting ducts in the distal nephron. Bradykinin generated is immediately destroyed by carboxypeptidase Y-like exopeptidase and neutral endopeptidase, both quite independent from the kininases in plasma, such as angiotensin converting enzyme. The salt-sensitivity of the blood pressure depends largely upon ethnicity and potassium intake. Interestingly, potassium and ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channel blockers accelerate renal kallikrein secretion and suppress blood pressure rises in animal hypertension models. Measurement of urinary kallikrein may become necessary in salt-sensitive normotensive and hypertensive subjects. Furthermore, pharmaceutical development of renal kallikrein releasers, such as K(ATP) channel blockers, and renal kininase inhibitors, such as ebelactone B, may lead to the development of novel antihypertensive drugs.",

    "698": "ALLHAT was a double-blind, randomized, clinical trial in 33,357 high-risk hypertensive patients aged > or =55 years. Hospitalized/fatal HF outcomes were examined with proportional-hazards models. Relative risks (95% confidence intervals; P values) of amlodipine or lisinopril versus chlorthalidone were 1.35 (1.21 to 1.50; <0.001) and 1.11 (0.99 to 1.24; 0.09). The proportional hazards assumption of constant relative risk over time was not valid. A more appropriate model showed relative risks of amlodipine or lisinopril versus chlorthalidone during year 1 were 2.22 (1.69 to 2.91; <0.001) and 2.08 (1.58 to 2.74; <0.001), and after year 1, 1.22 (1.08 to 1.38; P=0.001) and 0.96 (0.85 to 1.10; 0.58). There was no significant interaction between prior medication use and treatment. Baseline blood pressures were equivalent (146/84 mm Hg) and at year 1 were 137/79, 139/79, and 140/80 mm Hg in those given chlorthalidone, amlodipine, and lisinopril. At 1 year, use of added open-label atenolol, diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers in the treatment groups was similar.", 
    "699": "HF risk decreased with chlorthalidone versus amlodipine or lisinopril use during year 1. Subsequently, risk for those individuals taking chlorthalidone versus amlodipine remained decreased but less so, whereas it was equivalent to those given lisinopril. Prior medication use, follow-up blood pressures, and concomitant medications are unlikely to explain most of the HF differences. Diuretics are superior to calcium channel blockers and, at least in the short term, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in preventing HF in hypertensive individuals.",

Each group was studied at different time points: 0, 2, 4, 8, and 24 hours after instillation of meconium. Experiments were done at the University of Illinois and Michael Reese Hospital at Chicago. After treatment and instillation of meconium, the right lung was fixed with formalin, and 2-mum slices were obtained for immunohistochemistry. The left lung was used for obtaining of lung lavage and measurement of total proteins (for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and mRNA (for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) purification.", 
    "702": "We found that meconium induces inflammatory cytokine expression and apoptotic lung cell death. In situ end labeling revealed a dramatic DNA fragmentation in the meconium group, which supports the presence of apoptosis. Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we demonstrated increase of interleukin 6 and interleukin 8 cytokines in meconium-instilled lungs, which were significantly decreased in captopril-pretreated lungs. Captopril pretreatment also decreased meconium-induced cell death and angiotensinogen expression. We believe this effect is explained by the ability of captopril to decrease processing of ANGEN to angiotensinogen (ANG) I and finally to ANG II. It suggests that captopril inhibits ANG II-induced lung cell apoptosis.",

The SHR had significantly higher IASP (21.7 +/- 0.8 mm Hg) than the WKY (14.7 +/- 0.9 mm Hg), which was associated with the higher levels of angiotensin II (Ang II) in plasma (50.3 +/- 0.9 pg/ml) and in muscle bath perfusates (72.7 +/- 11.8 pg/ml) compared with the WKY (p < 0.05). Captopril and losartan decreased the IASP in SHR and WKY, but they were more potent in SHR. Captopril and losartan normalized the IASP in the SHR, whereas these agents may compromise rectoanal continence in the WKY. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blots showed higher levels of angiotensinogen, renin, ACE, and AT1-R in the internal anal sphincter (IAS) of SHR. Ang II caused concentration-dependent contraction of IAS smooth muscle strips from WKY (pEC50 = 8.5 +/- 0.1) and SHR (pEC50 = 8.6 +/- 0.2). Losartan (100 nM) significantly (p < 0.05) inhibited this effect. From these data, we conclude that 1) hypertensive IAS in SHR is primarily the result of renin-angiotensin system up-regulation, 2) ACE inhibitors and AT(1)-R antagonists simply relieve the hypertensive IAS, and 3) the differential effect of these inhibitors in the hypertensive versus the normotensive IAS may explain the lack of incontinence as a side effect in hypertensive patients receiving ACE inhibitors and AT1-R antagonists.", 
    "719": "Angiotensin-(1-7), a biologically active peptide of the renin-angiotensin system, is cardioprotective following ischemia/reperfusion and reduces cardiac hypertrophy. A recently discovered homolog of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), ACE2, is present in the heart and synthesizes angiotensin-(1-7) from angiotensin II. Cardiac ACE2 is elevated following inhibition of Ang II subtype 1 (AT(1)) receptors or blockade of angiotensin II production, suggesting that angiotensin-(1-7) plays a role in the beneficial effects of AT(1) receptor antagonists and ACE inhibitors in the heart. An increase in ACE2 activity and the production of angiotensin-(1-7) may thus represent a novel therapy for heart failure following myocardial infarction.", 
    "720": "The objective of the present study was to retrospectively examine whether the addition of minoxidil to patients who were already treated with maximum doses of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers but who had not achieved target blood pressures, has any detrimental effect on proteinuria or renal function or whether its effect on blood pressure prove salutary. The clinical records of the patients seen at the Hypertension, Nephrology, Dialysis and Transplantation Clinic from June 1982 through May 2005 were reviewed to identify 54 patients (78% men, 82% African-American) who had taken minoxidil (with and without angiotensin inhibition and blockade) and who had documented 24-hour urines for creatinine clearance and quantification of proteinuria before the initiation of minoxidil and after the blood pressure had stabilized on its final dose. The study was done at the Hypertension, Nephrology, Dialysis and Transplantation Clinic, the regional referral center for renal problems in eastern Alabama, USA. Minoxidil, whether alone or in combination with maximum doses of ACEIs and ARBs, was very successful in reduction of mean arterial pressure, but there was a tendency towards an increase in proteinuria. When minoxidil was given alone, patients demonstrated a trend towards reduction of proteinuria associated with blood pressure reduction; however, when minoxidil was added after the maximal doses of ACEIs and ARBs had been reached there was a significant increase in proteinuria (p = 0.017) on paired comparison in the same patients whose proteinuria had already demonstrated a significant decrease (p = 0.02) on the ACEI and ARB alone despite further significant reduction of blood pressure with the minoxidil (p = 0.003). Renal function deterioration to end stage renal disease correlated with increase in proteinuria (p = 0.03). We conclude that minoxidil was very effective in lowering systemic blood pressure but when given to patients already on maximum doses of ACEI and ARBs, there was an increase in proteinuria which could be interpreted as a detrimental effect having in mind that the blood pressure was significantly lowered.",

Systolic blood pressure values were determined at the beginning of the study by the tail-cuff pletysmographic method, at the 7th and 14th day of the treatment, as well as 14 days after the end of the drug administration. For evaluation of the effect of omapatrilat, candoxatril and enalapril on the investigated parameters (plasma atrial natriuretic peptide and serum ACE), 10 animals from the control group were sacrificed at the beginning of the study, and afterwards 10 animals from each group were also sacrificed on the 7th and 14th day of the treatment, as well as 14 days after the end of the drug administration (28th day).",

A prospective study to record all cases of adverse cutaneous reactions presenting with pityriasis rosea like manifestations was conducted at the center for drug-surveillance of the dermatology department of Cagliari University. We developed an intensive surveillance program from June 2002 to May 2005, adopting the WHO Collaborating center for Drug Monitoring causality assessment criteria and algorithm. Eight cases, six male and two female, were studied in a 3-year period. None had previously suffered from drug intolerance or allergy. Clinical manifestations were very similar to pityriasis rosea. Responsible drugs were mainly angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, alone or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide, followed by one case each for hydrochlorothiazide plus sartan, allopurinol, nimesulide, acetyl salicylic acid. Recovery was obtained in all cases with drug withdrawal. Final causality assessment was probable for all eruptions. Frequency of drug pityriasis rosea-like eruptions is probably underreported.

    "766": "Nephrin, podocin, CD2AP, and alpha-actinin-4 are important podocyte proteins that help maintain the integrity of the slit diaphragm and prevent proteinuria. Studies have shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, glucocorticoids, and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) have antiproteinuric effects. However, it is still unclear whether these drugs, with different pharmacological mechanisms, lead to a reduction in proteinuria by changing the expression and distribution of these important podocyte proteins. In this study, changes in the expression and distribution of nephrin, podocin, CD2AP, and alpha-actinin-4 were dynamically detected in Adriamycin-induced nephrotic (ADR) rats treated with three different drugs: lisinopril, prednisone, and ATRA. Nephropathy was induced by an intravenous injection of Adriamycin. After Adriamycin injection, rats received lisinopril, prednisone, and ATRA treatment, respectively. Renal tissues were collected at Days 3, 7, 14, and 28. The distribution and the expression of messenger RNA and protein of nephrin, podocin, CD2AP, and alpha-actinin-4 were detected by indirect immunofluorescence, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and Western blotting, respectively. With the intervention of lisinopril, prednisone, and ATRA, changes in the expression of nephrin, podocin, and CD2AP were diverse, which was different from that detected in ADR rats. After lisinopril and prednisone intervention, podocin exhibited prominent earlier changes compared with those of nephrin and CD2AP, whereas CD2AP showed more prominent changes after ATRA intervention. There was no change in the expression of alpha-actinin-4 molecule. In summary, we conclude that the antiproteinuric effects of lisinopril, prednisone, and ATRA were achieved by changes in the expression and distribution of the important podocyte molecules nephrin, podocin, CD2AP, and alpha-actinin-4. The pattern in the change of podocyte molecules after lisinopril and prednisone intervention was similar, but the pattern in the change of podocyte molecules after ATRA intervention was different from that of lisinopril or prednisone intervention.",

Patients reported optimal quality of life on the sub maximal dose bumetanide. Bumetanide decreased left ventricular function and increased heart rate and plasma noradrenaline in a dose dependent manner. Doses of bumetanide of more than 0.5 mg, given twice daily significantly decreased the quality of life and increased diuresis. Weight loss was maximal on 0.5 mg bumetanide twice daily. Trandolapril significantly reduced systolic blood pressure with the maximal effect at 0.5 mg daily. Both drugs significantly increased renin concentration with a significant potentiating interaction. It was not possible to detect beneficial effects of combination therapies. The optimal dosage of Bumetanide appeared to be 0.5 mg twice daily based on its effect on quality of life and weight loss.

By tradition and according to guideline recommendations, an ACEI is usually initiated first, followed by a beta-blocker after a varying time period based on clinical judgement. Early beta-blockade has several theoretical advantages, and two surrogate end point studies have indicated that initiation of CHF treatment with a beta-blocker may be superior to an ACEI. The Cardiac Insufficiency Bisoprolol III trial was the first trial investigating the optimum sequence of initiating treatment of CHF in terms of mortality and morbidity. The results indicated that, in stable, mildly to moderately symptomatic patients with systolic CHF, initiation of therapy with the beta-blocker bisoprolol followed by the ACEI enalapril was similarly efficacious to the opposite sequence in terms of combined mortality and all-cause hospitalisation. However, initiating therapy with bisoprolol showed a trend towards better survival, but also towards further worsening of CHF.

Newsletter and prescribing feedback was mailed in October 1999, September 2001 (newsletter only) and August 2003. Approximately a third of general practitioners (GPs) in Australia undertook at least one active educational activity (clinical audit, educational visit or case study) during the period October 1999-April 2004. National dispensing data from 1996 to 2004 were analysed using time series methodology with a decay term for intervention effect, to assess trends in prescribing of various classes of antihypertensives. In particular, the program aimed to increase the prescribing of thiazide diuretics and beta blockers.",

    "790": "Cardiac remodeling is a physiologic or pathologic condition that occurs after myocardial infarction, pressure overload, myocardial inflammatory diseases, idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy or volume overload. In spite of different etiologies, molecular, biochemical and mechanical processes are the same. The change in left ventricular function brings about a complex neuro-hormonal disorder, and disease progression is due to the combined action of several biological factors with toxic effects on the heart and vessels. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is very important in this process, through the effects on hydro-saline balance or through direct processes on myocardium. A direct effect of aldosterone in myocardial fibrosis after the detection of heart tissue aldosterone production has been demonstrated. In the past, the attention of physicians and researchers was focused on angiotensin II inhibition; and therefore, on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, considering them sufficient to antagonize the effects of aldosterone. Nevertheless, this theory has been confuted in recent studies, with the evidence of elevated plasmatic aldosterone levels in patients treated with ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers. This phenomenon probably is due to the activation of secondary ACTH mediated pathways of trial aldosterone production. It has been demonstrated that aldosterone receptor inhibition is effective in reducing cardiac remodeling and mortality. AREA-IN CHF is the first multicentric, double blind, randomized, placebo control study to compare canrenone, an aldosterone receptor blocker, with placebo. The primary end point is the echocardiographic evaluation of left ventricular remodeling. Secondary end points are left ventricular end-systolic volume, ejection fraction, diastolic filling patterns, NYHA functional class, and mortality and hospitalizations of cardiac origin. In addition, bio-humoral effects of aldosterone receptor blocker therapy will be investigated. The study results will be available at the end of 2006.", 
    "791": "In the 1980s congestive heart failure (CHF) was exclusively interpreted in hemodynamic terms. In accordance with this pathophysiologic hypothesis, cardiovascular drugs, mainly positive inotropics and/or vasodilators were used but not with significant results. From the mid 1980s, attention started focusing on the neurohumoral asset, strongly activated in patients suffering from CHF, and that it was itself the cause of CHF and responsible for the poor prognosis in these patients; therefore, to become the therapeutic target and to represent the rationale for using angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I), beta-blockers and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). Evidence has been provided that these drugs can reduce morbidity and mortality. However, this evidence derives only from studies on the general population. In uremic patients, there are no dedicated controlled trials, assuming that the effect can be extended to these patients, but this is not necessarily true. The evidence based on retrospective analysis is a better survival in patients using ACE-I, but there are no prospective trials on mortality and morbidity available. Even less evidence is available on ARBs, in spite of their favorable pharmacokinetic characteristics. Uremia has been suggested as state of excess sympathetic activation; therefore, the benefit derived from beta-blockers should be even greater in uremic than in non-renal patients. Therapy with beta-blockers significantly reduces morbidity and mortality in the general population. These results are also specifically demonstrated in dialysis patients. Finally, only specifically designed trials will be able to answer the questions that cardiologists and nephrologists ask themselves in their daily practice.", 
    "792": "Hypertension is defined by the Joint National Committee (JNC 7) as blood pressure (BP) > or =Y130/80 mmHg. It affects up to 70% of patients with type 2 diabetes and is twice as prevalent in diabetics as in non-diabetics. Due to its contribution to renal and cardiovascular disease, hypertension increases diabetic mortality four to five-fold. Therefore, a BP goal of 130/80 mmHg or less (125/75 mmHg in patients with proteinuria >1 g/die and increased creatinemia), is recommended. For isolated systolic hypertension, defined as a systolic BP > or =Y180 mmHg with normal diastolic BP, the treatment goal is to reduce systolic BP to <160 mmHg. The evidence from most trials suggests that there are only minimal differences between the various antihypertensive drugs, and that almost all agents are capable of successfully reducing adverse clinical events. Nevertheless, there is evidence that certain drugs are more useful in preventing damage to a specific organ system; and therefore, the selection of the therapy should be guided by the presence of concomitant disease and the protection of the organ system that is most at risk. Beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers are effective antianginals; diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blockers are useful for heart failure; ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers are especially effective in preserving renal function. Adequate BP control, irrespective of the type of antihypertensive drugs used, should replace the academic debate on what is the best antihypertensive agent.", 
    "793": "Nitrate tolerance is associated with an enhanced superoxide anion (O(2)(-)) production and may be attenuated by statins as they interact with the two main endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) and NAD(P)H oxidase pathways involved in this oxidative stress. Groups of wild-type (wt, C57Bl/6J) and eNOS knock-out mice (eNOS(-/-)) received rosuvastatin (20 mg kg(-1) day(-1) p.o.) for 5 weeks and a cotreatment with the statin plus nitroglycerin (NTG; 30 mg kg(-1) day(-1), subcutaneous injections b.i.d.) for the last 4 days. Another group received only NTG (30 mg kg(-1) d(-1), b.i.d. for 4 days) and finally control mice from both strains received no treatment. Rings of thoracic aortas from these groups were studied in organ baths. Relaxations to NTG (0.1 nM-0.1 mM) were determined on thromboxane analogue (U44619)-precontracted rings and O(2)(-) production (RLU 5 s(-1) mg(-1) of total protein content) was assessed in aorta homogenates with the lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence technique. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis was performed on aortas from both mice strains. In vivo NTG treatment induced a significant rightward shift of the concentration-effect curve to NTG compared to control group. There was, however, no cross-tolerance with non-nitrate sources of NO (unaltered response to acetylcholine in wt group). The rosuvastatin + NTG cotreatment was able to protect against the development of nitrate tolerance in both mice strains and L-mevalonate abolished this protective effect of rosuvastatin. In vivo treatment with apocynin, a purported NAD(P)H oxidase inhibitor, also produced a similar protection to that observed with rosuvastatin in both strains. Superoxide anion formation was increased after NTG treatment in both mice strains and the rosuvastatin + NTG cotreatment was able to reduce that production. Moreover, rosuvastatin treatment abolished the increase in gp91phox mRNA (an endothelial membrane NAD(P)H oxidase subunit) expression induced by in vivo exposure to NTG. These findings suggest that long-term rosuvastatin treatment protects against nitrate tolerance by counteracting NTG-induced increase in O(2)(-) production, probably via a direct interaction with the NAD(P)H oxidase pathway.", 
    "794": "Changes in proteolytic activity of the myocardium during the development of heart failure after left coronary artery ligation (CAL) of rats were examined. Hemodynamics of the rats at the eighth week (8w-CAL rat), but not at the second week (2w-CAL rat), after CAL showed the symptoms of chronic heart failure. Contents of mu-calpin and m-calpain, but not an intrinsic calpain inhibitor calpastatin, in the viable left ventricular muscle (viable LV) and the right ventricular muscle (RV) of the 2w-CAL and 8w-CAL rats were increased, which was associated with an elevation of intrinsic activities of leupeptin-sensitive, Ca(2+)-activated proteolysis in the cytosolic fractions of the viable LV and RV. Oral administration of 3 mg/kg/d trandolapril or 1 mg/kg/d candesartan from the second to eighth week after CAL improved the hemodynamics of 8w-CAL rats. The drug treatment attenuated the increases in mu-calpain and m-calpain contents and the elevation of the proteolytic activity of the viable LV and RV in the 8w-CAL rat. The drug treatment increased calpastatin content of the RV in the 8w-CAL rat. These results suggest that sustained activation of calpain is involved in the development of chronic heart failure and that trandolapril and candesartan prevent the activation of calpains after CAL.", 
    "795": "The relation between hypertension and the urinary excretion of calcium, citrate, and other factors is unclear. It has been proposed that increased urinary calcium excretion is a central feature of essential hypertension. Metabolic acidosis also may be associated with hypertension and decreases urinary citrate levels.",

Urinary calcium levels were not related consistently to hypertension. Excluding participants with single 24-hour urine collections and those administered thiazide diuretics or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors did not change the results.",

Macroscopic hematuria was the modality of clinical presentation in 51% of patients with familial IgA nephropathy and 39% of patients with sporadic IgA nephropathy. At univariable analysis, the sporadic form of IgA nephropathy was associated significantly with increased risk for renal death. However, patients with the sporadic form tended to be more hypertensive and diagnosed later, with signs of more advanced renal disease than those with familial disease at baseline. In the regression model, form of disease lost any independent effect. Only male sex, lower baseline glomerular filtration rate, greater proteinuria, and histopathologic score proved to be independent predictors of disease progression. Treatment with steroids or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors was associated with improved outcomes.",

    "804": "All elective patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting surgery between April 1996 and September 2002 were investigated. Patients were grouped according to their preoperative cardiac rhythm: sinus rhythm (SR) or preexisting atrial fibrillation (AF). In-hospital clinical outcomes and 5-year patient survival and cardiac-related event-free survival were compared using regression methods to adjust for differences between the groups. In all, 5,092 patients were identified, 175 (3.4%) with a history of preexisting AF. These patients were older (median, 64 versus 68 years) and had higher Parsonnet scores (median, 4 versus 8) than the SR group. Previous myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, renal impairment, peripheral vascular disease, ejection fraction less than 50%, previous surgery, congestive heart failure, and use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were also more common in the AF group.", 
    "805": "There were 60 in-hospital deaths (1.2%), with no difference between the two groups (odds ratio 1.02, 95% CI: 0.35 to 2.94). Atrial fibrillation patients were more likely to need intraoperative inotropes (p = 0.044), postoperative intra-aortic balloon pump (p = 0.038), and were less likely to be discharged within 6 days (p = 0.017). The risk of death in the 5 years after surgery was higher in the AF group (relative risk 1.49, 95% CI: 1.06 to 2.08, p = 0.020). In the AF group, 109 (62.2%) patients were cardioverted spontaneously by surgery, but only 69 (39.4%) remained in SR until discharge. Longer-term rhythm follow-up data were available for 48 of these 69 patients, and only 36 remained in SR at a median follow-up of 1,483 days (interquartile range, 1,120 to 2,209). Spontaneous conversion to SR after surgery did not confer a midterm survival benefit (p = 0.91).", 
    "806": "Preexisting AF in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery is not associated with increased in-hospital mortality and major morbidity; however, it is a risk factor for reduced 5-year survival. Spontaneous cardioversion to SR during surgery is transient in the majority of patients and is not associated with midterm survival benefit.", 
    "807": "Pax2 is a transcription factor with important functions during kidney development . Ectopic expression of Pax2 in podocytes has been reported in various glomerular diseases , but the functional relevance remains unknown. We developed an inducible mouse model that allows activation of Pax2 specifically in podocytes. Persistent expression of Pax2 did not interfere with the initial differentiation of podocytes, but mice ectopically expressing PAX2 developed end-stage renal failure soon after birth. Similarly, activation of PAX2 in healthy adult animals resulted in renal disease within 3 weeks after podocyte-specific induction of a deleter Cre. PAX2 activation caused repression of the podocyte key regulator molecule Wt1 and consequently a dramatic reduction of nephrin expression. Recruitment of the groucho-related protein TLE4 may be involved in converting Pax2 into a transcriptional repressor of Wt1. Finally, treatment of mice with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor normalized renal function and induced upregulation of the important structural molecule nephrin via a Wt1-independent pathway. Our data demonstrate the functional significance of PAX2 reexpression in mature podocytes for the development of glomerular diseases and suggest that reactivation of PAX genes in terminally differentiated cells leads to a more dedifferentiated phenotype.", 
    "808": "The oxidative modification of low-density lipoproteins (LDL) is a key event in the formation of atheromatous lesions. Indeed, oxidized derivatives accumulate in the vascular wall and promote a local inflammatory process which triggers the progression of the atheromatous plaque. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) has been mentioned as a major contributor to this oxidative process. It takes part in the oxidation both of lipids by chlorination and peroxidation and of apolipoprotein B-100. Based on recent observations with several anti-inflammatory and thiol-containing drugs, the present study was designed to test the hypothesis that anti-hypertensive agents from the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors group inhibit the oxidative modifications of Apo B-100 caused by MPO. Captopril, ramipril, enalapril, lisinopril and fosinopril were assessed by measuring: their inhibiting effect on the MPO/H(2)O(2)/Cl(-) system, the accumulation of compound II, which reflects the inhibition of the synthesis of HOCl and the LDL oxidation by MPO in presence of several concentrations of ACE inhibitors. Only captopril, a thiol-containing ACE inhibitor, was able to significantly decrease the oxidative modification of LDL in a dose dependent manner and this by scavenging HOCl. This efficient anti-hypertensive drug therefore appears to also protect against the atherosclerotic process by this newly documented mechanism.",

Of 61 potentially relevant articles screened, 6 trials met the inclusion criteria.

We performed random-effect model meta-analyses and quantified between-studies heterogeneity with I(2).", 
    "812": "There were 16,772 patients randomized to ACEI and 16,728 patients randomized to placebo. Use of ACEIs was associated with a decrease in cardiovascular mortality (relative risk [RR] 0.83, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.72 to 0.96, p = 0.01), nonfatal MI (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.94, p = 0.003), all-cause mortality (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.94, p = 0.0003), and revascularization rates (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.00, p = 0.04).

Nonetheless, heart failure often progresses despite treatment with diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-adrenergic blockers, aldosterone antagonists, and digoxin. Further, despite a steady decline in the risk of death from pump failure, many patients remain at high risk for sudden cardiac death. The annual incidence of sudden cardiac death in the U.S. alone has been estimated at 184,000 to over 400,000 cases. During the past decade, substantial advances have been made in the use of device-based therapy for this population. The role of the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) continues to evolve in routine heart failure management. The current status of ICD therapy in the treatment of heart failure patients based on randomized clinical trial results and published practice guidelines is summarized in this review.",

Renal cortical slices were incubated for 90 min in media containing 5 (normal) or 20 mmol/L (high) glucose. Superoxide anion (O2*-) and nitrate + nitrite (NO(X)) levels were measured in the media. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and NT content were measured in the tissue homogenate.", 
    "817": "In the UNTR group, high glucose increased O2*- and NO(X) production by the renal cortex (P < 0.05 vs. normal glucose). Likewise, NT content and SOD activity of the renal cortex augmented (P < 0.05 vs. normal glucose). In the ENAL group, O2*- production and NT content were glucose-insensitive, but high glucose exerted an exaggerated impact on NO(X) production and SOD activity (P < 0.01 vs. UNTR in high glucose).", 
    "818": "Accelerated NT content in the renal cortex during high-glucose conditions was prevented by ACE inhibitor treatment. It was suggested that, apart from its anti-hypertensive effect, the mechanism of suppressed NT degradation in the renal cortex by the ACE inhibitor enhances both O2*- degradation per se and antioxidative effects including SOD activation.",

If severe systolic HF persists, an aldosterone antagonist should be added. If HF persists, isosorbide dinitrate plus hydralazine should be added. Calcium channel blockers should be avoided if systolic HF is present. Digoxin should be avoided in men and women with diastolic HF if sinus rhythm is present and in women with systolic HF. Digoxin should be given to men with systolic HF if symptoms persist, but the serum digoxin level should be maintained between 0.5 and 0.8 ng/mL.",

The Eisai hyperbilirubinemic rat (EHBR) that lacks Mrp2 (multidrug resistance-associated protein 2) was used to appraise the role of Mrp2 in the excretion of [3H]EN and its metabolite [3H]ENA in single-pass rat liver preparations. Although the total and metabolic clearances and hepatic extraction ratios at steady-state were virtually unaltered for EN in EHBR compared with published values of Sprague-Dawley rats, the biliary clearances of EN and ENA were significantly reduced almost to zero (P<0.05). Involvement of human OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and MRP2 in EN transport was further assessed in single- or double-transfected mammalian cells. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells that expressed OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 showed that OATP1B3 transport of EN (20-500 microM) was of low affinity, whereas transport of EN by OATP1B1 was associated with the Km of 262+/-35 microM, a value similar to that for Oatp1a1 (214 microM). The transcellular transport of EN via human OATP1B1 and MRP2, investigated with the double-transfected Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) II cells in the Transwell system, showed that the sinusoidal to canalicular flux of EN in the OATP1B1/MRP2/MDCK cells was significantly higher (P<0.05) than that of mock/MDCK and OATP1B1/MDCK cells.

All experiments were performed in 18-week-old female spontaneously hypertensive rats arranged in three experimental groups: intact; ovariectomized (OVX); and ovariectomized plus treatment with 17beta-oestradiol (OVX + E2). These groups were used to evaluate the effects of captopril administration alone, or following bradykinin B2 receptor blockade or nitric oxide synthase inhibition, on a number of haemodynamic parameters (mean arterial pressure, cardiac index, vascular resistance and heart rate). The drop in mean arterial pressure and vascular resistance index in response to captopril was more pronounced in intact and ovariectomized rats treated with 17beta-oestradiol than in ovariectomized animals. Blockade of bradykinin B2 receptors or inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis attenuated the synergy between 17beta-oestradiol and captopril. It is concluded that ovariectomy blunted the blood pressure and vascular resistance index drop observed in intact rats in response to captopril. Treatment with 17beta-oestradiol prevented the blunted response to captopril in ovariectomized rats. Kinins and nitric oxide may be involved in the mechanisms of 17beta-oestradiol potentiation of the haemodynamic effects of captopril.",

In this area, there is an urgent need for improvement. Also difficult to understand is the fact that the guidelines for the treatment of chronic cardiac failure issued by the German Cardiology Society pay so little attention to cardiovascular research of cardiac insufficiency in old age, and thus bear indirect responsibility for the less than optimal treatment of this condition, which can be so severe in the old patient.

In all the patients, ABPM was performed and other parameters, including age, body mass index (BMI), waist/hip ratio (WHR), haemoglobin A1c (HbA(1c)), serum lipids and creatinine were also evaluated. The Pro12Ala polymorphism was analysed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Two subgroups of patients were compared: (a) Pro/Pro: homozygotic Pro/Pro (n=154) and (b) Ala: Ala allele carriers (Ala/Ala+Ala/Pro) (n=60). The studied groups were not different when age, BMI, WHR, HbA(1c), lipids, creatinine and frequency of hypertension were compared. A similar ratio of patients from both groups were treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, diuretics, beta-blockers and alpha-blockers. A difference was observed in a mean 24-h (Ala: 71.9+/-8.1 vs Pro/Pro: 69.4+/-7.8 mm Hg, P=0.034) and a mean night time (Ala: 67.1+/-7.8 vs Pro/Pro: 64.5+/-8.4 mm Hg, P=0.025) diastolic blood pressure, which was significantly higher in patients with Ala variant. There was also a trend towards a higher mean daytime diastolic blood pressure in this group. It seems that the Pro12Ala variant is associated with an increased mean 24-h diastolic blood pressure in obese diabetic patients. Different reaction for antihypertensive medication depending on a variant of the PPAR-gamma2 gene should also be considered as a possible cause of the presented results.",

    "846": "In 35 pigs (29+/-4 kg), myocardial infarction was generated by inflation of an over-the-wire angioplasty balloon in the circumflex artery for 60 min and 5 further pigs were sham-operated. Ten minutes after reperfusion, the pigs were randomized (2:1) to either growth hormone (1 IU/kg) (n=23) or normal saline (n=12), delivered via the balloon catheter. All survivors were treated with captopril and were sacrificed 4 weeks after myocardial infarction.",

Growth hormone increased wall thickness in the infarct (6.0+/-1.8 in controls versus 9.9+/-3.7 in treated animals, p=0.004) and non-infarct zones (10.6+/-1.8 in controls versus 15.5+/-3.8 in treated animals, p=0.0006) and produced higher (p<0.05) microvascular density in both zones.",

    "849": "We investigated the effects of salt loading on blood pressure, cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis as well as on the effectiveness of various antihypertensive therapies in young spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Twenty-five male SHR were salt-stimulated by drinking 1% NaCl from 3 to 6 months of age. Eighteen of them were treated for the last 2 weeks of salt loading with either the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril, the beta-adrenergic receptor blocker propranolol or the calcium-channel antagonist verapamil. Age-matched male Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats and SHR drinking only water served as controls. At the age of 6 months, SHR had significantly elevated blood pressure that was unchanged by salt loading. Relative heart weight was increased in SHR without (3.3) and even more so with salt intake (3.6 vs. 2.4 in WKY). Left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy was accompanied by a 17-fold increase in the expression of mRNA for atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) both in untreated and salt-loaded SHR compared to WKY (p<0.001). Collagen I and III mRNA increased 1.7-1.8-fold in SHR without and with additional salt intake (p<0.01). None of the therapies significantly reduced blood pressure or hypertrophy. Although captopril had no antihypertensive effect, it reduced ANF, collagen I and III mRNA in LV to control level. Less pronounced effects were achieved with verapamil. These findings emphasize the cardioprotective role of captopril which may not be fully expressed in the presence of elevated salt intake.", 
    "850": "Production of specific antibodies to haptens, especially antipeptides, without interference by carrier protein, is desirable. The bradykinin-potentiating peptides (BPPs) are a family of pyroglutamyl proline-rich oligopeptides with strong antihypertensive properties. In this work, the production of antibodies to BPPs by use of an efficient immunization protocol in mice genetically modified for the high antibody responsiveness (H(III) line) is described. Although it was possible to induce antibody production by single-dose administration of free BPPs, higher antibody titers were obtained in mice preimmunized with carrier protein before administration of peptides conjugated to this carrier. Interestingly, both mouse groups had a higher titer of IgG(1) than IgG(2a) isotypes, regardless of prior immunization with the carrier protein. However, a lower titer of IgG(2a) was observed in unprimed mice. A single band of about 27kDa corresponding to the BPP precursor protein was recognized by these antibodies in the cytosol of the Bothrops jararaca venom gland. This work proposes an efficient immunization protocol based on classic studies described for the hapten-carrier effect for generating specific antibodies against biologically active peptides.", 
    "851": "Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is a common primary disease that can cause acute renal failure in childhood. Renal disease is the most important long-term complication in patients who survived the acute stage of HUS. Use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and a restricted protein intake may be beneficial to the patients. However, it is not established whether such patients should be treated with steroids and immunosuppressors. The present study aimed to probe into the benefit of using steroid and immunosuppressor in patients after acute stage of HUS.", 
    "852": "The subjects included 17 patients (aged 9 months to 15 years, 12 males, 5 females) with HUS. Thirteen patients recovered from the acute stage of HUS, and underwent continuative treatment and follow-up. All the patients were treated with ACEI and early restriction of protein intake. Additionally, 2 children manifested as glomerulonephritis, one was treated with triperygium glycosides. Other 11 children who manifested as nephrotic syndrome were treated with prednisone, among them 5 children had no response or had incomplete response to prednisone, for these children short-term high dose cyclophosphamide or methylprednisolone pulse treatment were added; in 3 of the children short-term high dose methylprednisolone treatment was applied additionally for membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis and/or focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and crescentic glomerulonephritis.", 
    "853": "After follow-up for 2 months to 8 years, 4 patients with milder disease recovered, their blood pressure, renal function and urinalysis became normal, but 1 patient had recurrence. Among 9 patients with severe disease, 6 maintained normal blood pressure, recovered renal function and urinalysis, the other 3 patients failed to comply with treatment protocol and died during the 3rd, 9th and 13th month. The remainder (4 cases) gave up therapy and died on the 27th to 48th days of the course.", 
    "854": "The treatment applied in this study could improve the prognosis of patients after acute phase of HUS evidently by using the steroid and immuno suppressor according to clinical classification and pathological findings. It is recommended that triperygium glycosides is beneficial to children with glomerulonephritis, proteinuria and hematuria after acute stage of HUS. Adjustment of therapeutic schedule based on pathological findings after renal biopsy is helpful. To the patients with progressive renal failure who have no response to the steroid and immunosuppressors, steroid and immunosuppressor should be discontinued and dialysis treatment should be applied. Protocol compliance is also an important factor.", 
    "855": "Somatic angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) contains two homologous domains, each bearing a functional active site. Studies on the selectivity of these ACE domains towards either substrates or inhibitors have mostly relied on the use of mutants or isolated domains of ACE. To determine directly the selectivity properties of each ACE domain, working with wild-type enzyme, we developed an approach based on the combined use of N-domain-selective and C-domain-selective ACE inhibitors and fluorogenic substrates. With this approach, marked differences in substrate selectivity were revealed between rat, mouse and human somatic ACE. In particular, the fluorogenic substrate Mca-Ala-Ser-Asp-Lys-DpaOH was shown to be a strict N-domain-selective substrate of mouse ACE, whereas with rat ACE it displayed marked C-domain selectivity. Similar differences in selectivity between these ACE species were also observed with a new fluorogenic substrate of ACE, Mca-Arg-Pro-Pro-Gly-Phe-Ser-Pro-DpaOH. In support of these results, changes in amino-acid composition in the binding site of these three ACE species were pinpointed. Together these data demonstrate that the substrate selectivity of the N-domain and C-domain depends on the ACE species. These results raise concerns about the interpretation of functional studies performed in animals using N-domain and C-domain substrate selectivity data derived only from human ACE.", 
    "856": "Standards for secondary prevention in patients after acute coronary syndromes have been recently published by the European Society of Cardiology. They do not differ between patients without or with renal failure, but it may be suggested that the later group deserves special attention and more aggressive treatment. Both after myocardial infarction and unstable angina, practically all patients are supposed to receive antiplatelet therapy, statins, beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. They also are submitted to intensive coronary risk factor modifications. In recently undertaken Polish registry study of secondary prevention in acute myocardial infarction/unstable angina survivors and post-revascularization patients (STOK--Standard Terapii i Opieki Kardiologicznej trial) over 31,000 records of individual patients discharged from internal disease or cardiologic wards in Poland in 2002 were gathered. When records of 2,780 patients with concomitant elevated serum creatinine were compared with data of 28,585 patients with normal renal function, some interesting conclusions were drawn. Firstly, the group of patients with suspected renal dysfunction was characterized with more often recognized: diabetes, heart failure and peripheral vessel disease. Secondly paradoxically--they were less often prescribed with antiplatelet drugs, statins, beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors. Thus theory do not translate into practice.", 
    "857": "The term microalbuminuria stands for an increased urinary excretion of albumin undetectable by routine methods for determination of proteinuria. Microalbuminuria is found in a substantial proportion of patients with diabetes, arterial hypertension and in the elderly. New data has provided strong evidence that albuminuria not only indicates early glomerular damage but also widespread endothelial dysfunction, early atherogenesis and increased cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk. It has been shown that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors have a potential to decrease urinary albumin excretion, which confirms their well-established nephro- and vasoprotective action.", 
    "858": "Arterial stiffness is a dynamic property which depends on structure and function of arteries. Arterial stiffness progresses with age and it is an important factor leading to increase of systolic and pulse pressure and decrease in diastolic blood pressure. Increased arterial stiffness was also found in hypertension, chronic renal failure and diabetes. Arterial stiffness is an independent prognostic factor of mortality in hypertension and end-stage renal disease. Arterial stiffening leads to cardiovascular complications such as left ventricular hypertrophy. Many methods to assess different aspects of arterial stiffness: systemic, regional and local were developed. Various indicies of arterial stiffness were defined and are used in clinical investigations. Arterial stiffness is a dynamic parameter. Decrease in blood pressure leads to decrease of arterial stiffness. Many authors suggest, that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors may exert favourable effect, irrespective of blood pressure. Arterial stiffness assessment may become a cardiovascular risk parameter and a therapeutic goal.",

    "861": "Nineteen patients with a mean age of 56 years (range 38-76 years) were recruited for this study. All patients had confirmed intracranial aneurysms. A double-blind, randomized, crossover study was performed using perindopril, irbesartan, isosorbide mononitrate, and a placebo. Blood pressure and pulse pressure waveforms were assessed at the end of each 4-week treatment period. Perindopril and irbesartan were well tolerated. For all measured parameters except heart rate (p = 0.03), no significant difference between baseline and placebo was identified. Each drug when compared with placebo reduced peripheral arterial blood pressure. Perindopril significantly decreased mean blood pressure by 10 mm Hg (p = 0.004), irbesartan by 9 mm Hg (p = 0.004), and isosorbide mononitrate by 13 mm Hg (p = 0.005). The administration of each drug effected a significant reduction in the carotid artery augmentation index (AIX) compared with baseline values (perindopril p = 0.01, irbesartan p = 0.0002, and isosorbide mononitrate p = 0.03). There was also a significant difference in the AIX between irbesartan and the placebo (p = 0.05). Compared with the placebo, there was a significant difference in AIX (adjusted for heart rate) following the administration of irbesartan (p = 0.003) and isosorbide mononitrate (p = 0.01), but not with perindopril (p = 0.17).",

Forty-four patients (43%) had anemia at the time of hospital admission, 34 of them had true anemia and 10spurious anemia caused by hemodilution. Patients taking preadmission angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors had more severe anemia than those not taking them (p<0.01).

    "867": "With the introduction of the aldosterone/renin ratio as a screening test, the detection rate of primary aldosteronism has increased considerably. Nevertheless, no consensus has so far been reached regarding the cutoff points, operating characteristics or indeed even the reference values for reporting the aldosterone/renin ratio using plasma active renin (ng/l or mU/l) measured by immunoradiometric assay. We review the characteristics of this ratio in normal individuals, essential hypertension and primary hyperaldosteronism in an attempt to reach an agreement regarding its optimum use and interpretation - both using the renin activity or concentration. It seems that the optimal cutoff for patients with primary aldosteronism is above 30 ng/dl per mug/l/h or 800 pmol/l per mug/l/h or 130 pmol/ng or 80 pmol/mU. We explore enhancing measures such as captopril loading or use with a plasma aldosterone cutoff as well as pitfalls with the test such as confounding medications or the need for confirmatory testing. For the latter, demonstration of autonomous aldosterone production via salt loading is widely used, but may not be most advantageous and may even be contraindicated in patients with severe hypertension. The renin stimulation test may be an alternative being safe, well tolerated, and cost effective.", 
    "868": "A novel strategy for screening the enzyme inhibitors from the complex mixtures by capillary electrophoresis with an on-column immobilized enzyme microreactor created by an ionic binding technique is reported. The enzyme microreactor was prepared in two steps: First, the capillary wall was dynamically coated with a polycationic electrolyte hexadimethrine bromide (HDB) by simply flushing the column using the HDB solution. Subsequently, a plug of the enzyme solution was injected and incubated for 5 min to permit the enzyme molecules to immobilize on the positively charged coating via ionic binding. To demonstrate this strategy, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) was employed as a model for the enzyme immobilization, inhibition study, and inhibitor screening. It has been proved that such a prepared immobilized ACE microreactor displays a high enough activity and stability. Furthermore, the immobilized enzyme microreactor could be easily renewed. The inhibition study or inhibitor screening was accomplished through the following procedure: (i) the substrate solution was injected and incubated within the microreactor for a short time span; (ii) subsequently, the voltage was applied to separate the product of the enzyme reaction from the unreacted substrate based on their different mobilities, the peak area of the product representing the enzyme activity; (iii) a certain amount of enzyme inhibitor or candidate compound was spiked into the substrate solution to assay the reduction of the immobilized enzyme activity. Thus, the inhibitors can be easily identified if the reduced peak area of the product is observed in electropherograms. Because the injection volume of the capillary was only 9.8 nL and the enzyme could be reusable, the assay cost could be dramatically reduced. The screening of a small compound library containing natural extracts and commercially available inhibitors was performed. The present approach has proved to be simple, rapid, and robust.", 
    "869": "CGS 35601 (L-tryptophan, N-[[1-[[(2S)-2-mercapto-4-methyl-1-oxopentyl]amino]-cyclopentyl]carbonyl]) is one of a few single molecules capable of inhibiting the activities of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), neutral endopeptidase (NEP) and endothelin converting enzyme (ECE) simultaneously, with IC(50) values of 22, 2, and 55 nM, respectively. Through the inhibition of ACE and ECE, it blocks the conversion of angiotensin I (AI) and big endothelin-1 (big ET-1) into the two most potent peptidic vasoconstrictors, angiotensin II (AII) and ET-1, respectively. By inhibiting NEP, CGS 35601 also prevents the degradation of peptidic vasodilators such as bradykinin (BK), natriuretic peptides (NPs) and adrenomedullin (ADM) and, hence, modulates the secondary release of other vasoactive mediators such as nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandins. In chronic (30 days) experiments, CGS 35601 is well tolerated with a very good safety profile in healthy normotensive, hypertensive and type 2 diabetic rats. The antihypertensive efficacy of CGS 35601 was demonstrated in chronically instrumented, unrestrained and conscious rat models of hypertension (SHR and DSS) and type 2 diabetes (ZDF-fatty). It lowered blood pressure effectively as well as modulated plasma concentrations of a number of circulating vasoactive peptidic mediators that are keys to the regulation of the vascular tone. These data suggest that CGS 35601, a triple vasopeptidase inhibitor (VPI), may represent a novel class of antihypertensive drugs and may have the potential to reduce morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disorders, diabetes and subsequent renal complications. Similar in vivo ACE, NEP, and ECE inhibitory activities were also observed with the orally active prodrug, CGS 37808 (L-tryptophan, N-[[1-[[(2S)-2-(acetylthio)-4-methyl-1-oxopentyl]amino]cyclopentyl]-carbonyl]-, methyl ester.", 
    "870": "Heart failure is associated with alterations in cardiac and skeletal muscle energy metabolism resulting in a generalized myopathy. We investigated the molecular and cellular effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (ACEi) on skeletal muscle metabolism in infarcted animals. Myocardial infarction (MI) was obtained by left descending coronary artery ligation. Sham, MI, and MI-treated rats (perindopril, 2 mg.kg(-1).day(-1) given 7 days after MI) were studied 1 and 4 mo after surgery. Oxygen consumption of white gastrocnemius (Gas) muscle was studied in saponin-permeabilized fibers, using the main substrates of mitochondrial respiration. mRNA expression of nuclear factors (PGC-1alpha, NRF-2alpha, and mtTFA), involved in the transcription of mitochondrial proteins, and of MCIP1, a marker of calcineurin activation, were also determined. Echocardiographic left ventricular fractional shortening was reduced in both MI and perindopril group after 1 and 4 mo, whereas systemic blood pressure was reduced by 16% only in the MI group after 4 mo. The capacity of Gas to oxidize glutamate-malate, glycerol-triphosphate, or pyruvate (-30%, P < 0.01; -32%, P < 0.05; -33%, P < 0.01, respectively), was greatly decreased. Furthermore, PGC-1alpha (-54%), NRF-2alpha (-45%), and MCIP1 (-84%) gene expression were significantly downregulated. ACEi improved survival, left ventricular function, and blood pressure. Perindopril protected also totally the Gas mitochondrial function and preserved the mRNAs concentration of the mitochondrial transcriptional factors. Moreover, PGC-1alpha correlated with Gas oxidative capacity (r = 0.48), mitochondrial cytochrome-c oxidase (r = 0.65), citrate synthase (r = 0.45) activities, and MCIP1 expression (r = 0.44). Thus ACEi totally prevented MI-induced alterations of skeletal muscle mitochondrial function and protein expression, halting the development of this metabolic myopathy.", 
    "871": "Inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) protects against the progression of several cardiovascular diseases. Because of its dual role in regulating angiotensin II and bradykinin levels, the positive clinical effects of ACE inhibitors were thought to be the consequence of concomitant reductions in the production of angiotensin II and the degradation of bradykinin. Recent evidence suggests that some of the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors on cardiovascular function and homeostasis can be attributed to novel mechanisms. These include the accumulation of the ACE substrate N-acetyl-seryl-aspartyl-lysyl-proline, which blocks collagen deposition in the injured heart, as well as the activation of an ACE signaling cascade that involves the activation of the kinase CK2 and the c-Jun N-terminal kinase in endothelial cells and leads to changes in gene expression. Moreover, at least one other ACE homologue (ACE2) is proposed to counteract the detrimental effects associated with the activation of the classical renin-angiotensin system. These data reveal hitherto unexpected levels of internal regulation of the renin-angiotensin system.",

The release layer contained captopril and various polymers such as HPMC-K15M, PVP-K30 and Carbopol 934p, alone or in combination with the drug. The floating behavior and in vitro dissolution studies were carried out in a USP 23 apparatus 2 in simulated gastric fluid (without enzyme, pH 1.2). Final formulation released approximately 95% drug in 24 h in vitro, while the floating lag time was 10 min and the tablet remained floatable throughout all studies. Final formulation followed the Higuchi release model and showed no significant change in physical appearance, drug content, floatability or in vitro dissolution pattern after storage at 45 degrees C/75% RH for three months. Placebo formulation containing barium sulphate in the release layer administered to human volunteers for in vivo X-ray studies showed that BFT had significantly increased the gastric residence time.",

Angiotensin II(Ang II), major substrate in RAS, stimulates atherosclerosis through various processes such as endothelial dysfunction, cellular proliferation and inflammation. Recently, local RAS in vasculature is reported to play an important role. Many of these atherogenic effects of Ang II are mediated by reactive oxygen species(ROS). Investigation of the role of ROS and inflammation induced by RAS may provide a clue to understanding the pathophysiology of atherosclerotic diseases, and may lead to a new therapeutic strategy.",

Advances in the management of patients with ACS have evolved dramatically. Recently the concept of interventional cardiology expand beyond mechanical revascularization to embrace preventive interventions that forestall future cardiac and vascular events. The pleiotropic effect of preventive agents contributes to early and significant risk reduction in high-risk patients and also after being suffered from ACS.",

Angiotensin II is deeply involved in vasoconstriction, oxidative stress, inflammation, thrombosis, vascular remodeling, and sympathetic nerve activity. Many studies have documented the favorable effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor(ACE-I) and angiotensin receptor blocker(ARB) on cardiovascular disease in basic and clinical trials. Now accumulated evidences suggest ACE-I and ARB potentially prevent coronary plaque rapture, thrombosis and myocardial remodeling with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). ACS is occurred from plaque rupture on mild to moderate coronary atherosclerosis. Therefore, on treatment of ACS, it is important to prevent the plaque rupture and thrombosis by pharmacological intervention with ACE-I and ARB than coronary artery intervention which is down stream therapy for coronary artery stenosis.",
