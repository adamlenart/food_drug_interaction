    "0": "Diabetes mellitus is increasingly common worldwide and is expected to affect 592 million people by 2035. The kidney is often involved. A key goal in treating diabetes is to reduce the risk of development of kidney disease and, if kidney disease is already present, to delay the progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). This represents a social and ethical issue, as a significant proportion of patients reaching ESRD in developing countries do not have access to renal replacement therapy.", 
    "1": "The present review focuses on novel therapeutic approaches for diabetic nephropathy (DN), implemented on the basis of recent insights on its pathophysiology, which might complement the effects of single inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), the cornerstone of renoprotective interventions in diabetes, along with glycemic and blood pressure control.", 
    "2": "Although a plethora of new treatment options has arisen from experimental studies, the number of novel renoprotective molecules successfully implemented in clinical practice over the last two decades is disappointingly low. Thus, new investigational strategies and diagnostic tools - including the appropriate choice of relevant renal end points and the study of urinary proteome of patients - will be as important as new therapeutic interventions to fight DN. Finally, in spite of huge financial interests in replacing the less expensive ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers with newer drugs, any future therapeutic approach has to be tested on top of - rather than instead of - optimal RAAS blockade.",

About ninety ACS patients were consecutively enrolled from each hospital since April 15, 2012 according to a standard protocol. Totally, 3 253 patients with complete data were analyzed in this study.", 
    "5": "(1) The average age of male patients with ACS was lower than that of female patients (60.4 years vs 66.2 years, P < 0.01). Nearly 60% of ACS patients were under the age of 65 years. Early onset of ACS accounted for one-third of male (< 55 years of age) and two-fifthes of female patients (< 65 years old). (2) Among the four ACS major risk factors (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking and diabetes), hypertension was with the highest prevalence (68.4%). More than 90% of ACS patients had at least one risk factor and about two-thirds of them had at least two. (3) As for the application of evidence-based drugs, the top one was aspirin with 95.3% of ACS patients reseiving it. The second was statins (90.1%). Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotension II receptor blocker (ARB) was the lowest (53.6%). Multivariable analysis indicated that, in contrast to that in ACS patients without percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), the drug usage rates were increased by more than 30% for ACEI or ARB and \u03b2 receptor blockers, by more than 50% for statins, and by 4-7 times for antiplatelet agents among ACS patients with PCI.",

    "7": "Discovering ways to control the activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), zinc-dependent enzymes capable of degrading extracellular matrix proteins, is an important field of cancer research. We report here a novel strategy for assembling MMP inhibitors on the basis of oligopeptide ligands by exploring the pattern known as the zinc finger motif. Advanced molecular modeling tools were used to characterize the structural binding motifs of experimentally tested MMP inhibitors, as well as those of newly proposed peptidomimetics, in their zinc-containing active sites. The results of simulations based on the quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) approach and Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics with QM/MM potentials demonstrate that, upon binding of Regasepin1, a known MMP-9 inhibitor, the Zn(2+)(His3) structural element is rearranged to the Zn(2+)(Cys2His2) zinc finger motif, in which two Cys residues are borrowed from the ligand. Following consideration of the crystal structure of MMP-2 with its inhibitor, the oligopeptide APP-IP, we proposed a new peptidomimetic with two replacements in the substrate, Tyr3Cys and Asp6Cys. Simulations show that this peptide variant blocks an enzyme active site by the Zn(2+)(Cys2His2) zinc finger construct. Similarly, a natural substrate of MMP-2, Ace-Gln-Gly \u223c Ile-Ala-Gly-Nme, can be converted to an inhibiting compound by two replacements, Ile by Cys and Gly by the d isomer of Cys, favoring formation of the zinc finger motif.",

About 20 years have passed since COL4A3, COL4A4, and COL4A5 were identified and the first Alport mouse model was developed using a knockout approach. The phenotype of Alport mice is similar to that of Alport patients, including characteristic thickening and splitting of the glomerular basement membrane. Alport mice have been widely used to study the pathogenesis of AS and to develop effective therapies. In this review, the newer therapies for AS, such as pharmacological interventions, genetic approaches and stem cell therapies, are discussed. Although some stem cell therapies have been demonstrated to slow the renal disease progression in Alport mice, these therapies demand continual refinement as research advances. In terms of the pharmacological drugs, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been shown to be effective in Alport mice. Novel therapies that can provide a better outcome or lead to a cure are still awaited.",

Whether socioeconomic factors influence prescription patterns and blood pressure control differently in women and men has not been investigated. This cross-sectional study performed in a cohort of hypertensive patients from the Swedish Primary Care Cardiovascular Database (SPCCD) examined the influence of educational level, country of birth, gender and concomitant psychiatric disorder on prescription pattern and blood pressure control in 40,825 hypertensive patients. Men were more often than women treated with calcium channel blocker and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), irrespective of education, country of birth and psychiatric disorder. Educational level influenced the prescription pattern to some extent, where the gender differences were reduced in patients with a higher educational level. In women, but not in men, high educational level and concomitant psychiatric disorder were associated with a higher proportion reaching target blood pressure. The predominant use of ACEI and calcium channel blockers in men is not influenced by educational level, country of birth or psychiatric disorder. Thus other explanations must be considered such as gender differences in side effects. Educational level seems to have a greater impact on reaching target blood pressure in women compared with men.",

The study was conducted on male Wistar rats. All experimental procedures were carried out under full anaesthesia. The principal experiment included a 2 hour observation period in haemorrhagic shock. Drugs used - a selective 5-HT1A agonist 8-OH-DPAT (5 \u03bcg/5 \u03bcl); V1a receptor antagonist [\u03b2-mercapto-\u03b2, \u03b2-cyclo-pentamethylenepropionyl(1),O-me-Tyr(2),Arg(8)]AVP (10 \u03bcg/kg); angiotensin type I receptor antagonist (AT1) ZD7155 (0.5 mg/kg, i.v.); angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor captopril (30 mg/kg, i.v.); melanocortin type 4 (MC4) receptor antagonist HS014 (5 \u03bcg, i.c.v.). There was no influence of ZD715, captopril or blocking of the V1a receptors on changes in the heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), peripheral blood flow or resistance caused by the central stimulation of 5-HT1A receptors (P\u22650.05). However, selective blocking of central MC4 receptors caused a slight, but significant decrease in HR and MAP (P<0.05). POMC derivatives acting via the central MC4 receptor participate in the resuscitative effects of 8-OH-DPAT. The angiotensin and vasopressin systems do not participate in these actions.",

High urinary output secondary to polydipsia was associated with proximal tubule dysfunction. Compared to controls, dTGM had a lower hyperglycemia induced by an intraperitoneal glucose administration. This decrease was not due to changes in insulin sensitivity and/or secretion. dTGM had an increased creatinine production and a lower epididymal fat mass. Acute inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme with ramipril did not suppress this improved glucose tolerance profile.",

    "23": "Because the effects of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitors on blood pressure are controversial, we examined the long-term effects of sitagliptin (80 mg/kg per day) on blood pressure (radiotelemetry) in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), Wistar-Kyoto rats, and Zucker Diabetic-Sprague Dawley rats (metabolic syndrome model). In SHR, chronic (3 weeks) sitagliptin significantly increased systolic, mean, and diastolic blood pressures by 10.3, 9.2, and 7.9 mm Hg, respectively, a response abolished by coadministration of BIBP3226 (2 mg/kg per day; selective Y1-receptor antagonist). Sitagliptin also significantly increased blood pressure in SHR treated with hydralazine (vasodilator; 25 mg/kg per day) or enalapril (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor; 10 mg/kg per day). In Wistar-Kyoto rats, chronic sitagliptin slightly decreased systolic, mean, and diastolic blood pressures (-1.8, -1.1, and -0.4 mm Hg, respectively). In Zucker Diabetic-Sprague Dawley rats, chronic sitagliptin decreased systolic, mean, and diastolic blood pressures by -7.7, -5.8, and -4.3 mm Hg, respectively, and did not alter the antihypertensive effects of chronic enalapril. Because DPP4 inhibitors impair the metabolism of neuropeptide Y1-36 (NPY1-36; Y1-receptor agonist) and glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1(7-36)NH2 (GLP-1 receptor agonist), we examined renovascular responses to NPY1-36 and GLP-1(7-36)NH2 in isolated perfused SHR and Zucker Diabetic-Sprague Dawley kidneys pretreated with norepinephrine (to induce basal tone). In Zucker Diabetic-Sprague Dawley kidneys, NPY1-36 and GLP-1(7-36)NH2 exerted little, if any, effect on renovascular tone. In contrast, in SHR kidneys, both NPY1-36 and GLP-1(7-36)NH2 elicited potent and efficacious vasoconstriction.", 
    "24": "(1) The effects of DPP4 inhibitors on blood pressure are context dependent; (2) The context-dependent effects of DPP4 inhibitors are due in part to differential renovascular responses to DPP4\u2019s most important substrates (NPY1\u201336 and GLP-1(7\u201336)NH2) [corrected]; (3) Y1 receptor antagonists may prevent the prohypertensive and possibly augment the antihypertensive effects of DPP4 inhibitors.", 
    "25": "In the digestive tract of humans, bioactive peptides, i.e. protein fragments impacting the physiological activity of the body, may be released during the digestion of food proteins, including those of fish. The aim of the study was to establish the method of human ex vivo digestion of carp muscle tissue and evaluate the angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory and antioxidant activities of hydrolysates obtained after digestion. It was found that the hydrolysates of carp muscle tissue obtained with the three-stage method of simulated ex vivo digestion showed ACE inhibitory as well as antioxidative activities. It was demonstrated that the degree of hydrolysis depended on the duration of individual stages and the degree of comminution of the examined material. Although the applied gastric juices initiated the process of hydrolysis of carp muscle tissue, the duodenal juices caused a rapid increase in the amount of hydrolysed polypeptide bonds. The antihypertensive and antioxidative activities of the hydrolysates of carp muscle tissue increased together with progressive protein degradation. However, the high degree of protein hydrolysis does not favour an increase in the activity of free radical scavenging. The presented results are an example of the first preliminary screening of the potential health-promoting biological activity of carp muscle tissue in an ex vivo study.",

Peptide fractions of molecular weight lower than 3 and 3-10\u00a0kDa were further subjected to the RP-HPLC. Separated preparations were investigated for their potential as the natural inhibitors of dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP-IV), \u03b1-glucosidase and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). WPC-80 hydrolysate showed higher inhibitory activities against the three tested enzymes than \u03b2-lactoglobulin hydrolysate.

We have previously characterized and demonstrated mitigation of single organ injuries, such as radiation pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis or nephropathy by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Our current work extends this research to examine the potential for mitigating multiple organ dysfunctions occurring in the same irradiated rats. Using total body irradiation (TBI) followed by bone marrow transplant, we tested four doses of X radiation (11, 11.25, 11.5 and 12 Gy) to develop lethal late effects. We identified three of these doses (11, 11.25 and 11.5 Gy TBI) that were lethal to all irradiated rats by 160 days to test mitigation by ACE inhibitors of injury to the lungs and kidneys. In this study we tested three ACE inhibitors at doses: captopril (88 and 176 mg/m(2)/day), enalapril (18, 24 and 36 mg/m(2)/day) and fosinopril (60 mg/m(2)/day) for mitigation. Our primary end point was survival or criteria for euthanization of morbid animals. Secondary end points included breathing intervals, other assays for lung structure and function and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) to assess renal damage. We found that captopril at 176 mg/m(2)/day increased survival after 11 or 11.5 Gy TBI. Enalapril at 18-36 mg/m(2)/day improved survival at all three doses (TBI). Fosinopril at 60 mg/m(2)/day enhanced survival at a dose of 11 Gy, although no improvement was observed for pneumonitis.

Genetic polymorphisms may partially account for the interindividual variability and abnormal response to antihypertensive drugs. Candidate gene and genome-wide approaches have identified common genetic variants associated with response to antihypertensive drugs. However, there is no currently available pharmacogenetic test to guide hypertension treatment in clinical practice. In this review, we aimed to summarize the recent findings on pharmacogenetics of the most commonly used antihypertensive drugs in clinical practice, including diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers, beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers. Notably, only a small percentage of the genetic variability on response to antihypertensive drugs has been explained, and the vast majority of the genetic variants associated with antihypertensives efficacy and toxicity remains to be identified. Despite some genetic variants with evidence of association with the variable response related to these most commonly used antihypertensive drug classes, further replication is needed to confirm these associations in different populations. Further studies on epigenetics and regulatory pathways involved in the responsiveness to antihypertensive drugs might provide a deeper understanding of the physiology of hypertension, which may favor the identification of new targets for hypertension treatment and genetic predictors of antihypertensive response.",

Using a novel experimental design, the present experiments investigated whether putative molecular markers of neural plasticity and changes in the message for components of the brain renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS) accompany the sensitization of sodium appetite. An initial set of experiments examined whether the glutamatergic N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist MK-801 would attenuate sodium appetite sensitization and prevent changes in mRNA expression associated with sensitization. Rats with repeated sodium depletions exhibited enhanced sodium appetite and mRNA expression for components of the RAAS in areas along the lamina terminalis (LT), a region of the brain that is important for the regulation of body fluid homeostasis, and these effects were significantly attenuated by MK-801 pretreatment. A second set of experiments investigated whether successive sodium depletions would elevate sodium intake and induce a pattern of fos-B staining consistent with the \u0394fos-B isoform in areas along the LT. The pattern of fos-B staining in the subfornical organ was consistent with the characteristics of \u0394fos-B expression. Specifically, fos-B/\u0394fos-B expression was increased 4 days after the last of a series of sodium depletions, fos-B/\u0394fos-B expression was nearly absent in control rats, and the quantity of fos-B/\u0394fos-B staining was directly associated with a history of sodium depletions. These findings demonstrate that the sensitization of sodium appetite is associated with sustained molecular alterations in the LT that are indicative of neural plasticity and upregulation of the central RAAS.",

These reactions are the first steps of N-linked glycan processing and are essential for proper folding and function of many glycoproteins. Because most of the viral envelope glycoproteins contain N-linked glycans, inhibition of ER glucosidases with derivatives of 1-deoxynojirimycin, i.e., iminosugars, efficiently disrupts the morphogenesis of a broad spectrum of enveloped viruses. However, like viral envelope proteins, the cellular receptors of many viruses are also glycoproteins. It is therefore possible that inhibition of ER glucosidases not only compromises virion production but also disrupts expression and function of viral receptors and thus inhibits virus entry into host cells. Indeed, we demonstrate here that iminosugar treatment altered the N-linked glycan structure of angiotensin I-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which did not affect its expression on the cell surface or its binding of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) spike glycoprotein. However, alteration of N-linked glycans of ACE2 impaired its ability to support the transduction of SARS-CoV and human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) spike glycoprotein-pseudotyped lentiviral particles by disruption of the viral envelope protein-triggered membrane fusion. Hence, in addition to reducing the production of infectious virions, inhibition of ER glucosidases also impairs the entry of selected viruses via a post-receptor-binding mechanism.",

The aim of this study was to obtain ACE inhibiting peptide from peanut protein and provide insight on the molecular mechanism of its ACE inhibiting action. Peanut peptides having ACE inhibitory activity were isolated through enzymatic hydrolysis and ultrafiltration. Further chromatographic fractionation was conducted to isolate a more potent peanut peptide and its antihypertensive activity was analyzed through in vitro ACE inhibitory tests and in vivo animal experiments. MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS was used to identify its amino acid sequence. Mechanism of ACE inhibition of P8 was analyzed using molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation. A peanut peptide (P8) having Lys-Leu-Tyr-Met-Arg-Pro amino acid sequence was obtained which had the highest ACE inhibiting activity of 85.77% (half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50): 0.0052 mg/ml). This peanut peptide is a competitive inhibitor and show significant short term (12 h) and long term (28 days) antihypertensive activity. Dynamic tests illustrated that P8 can be successfully docked into the active pocket of ACE and can be combined with several amino acid residues. Hydrogen bond, electrostatic bond and Pi-bond were found to be the three main interaction contributing to the structural stability of ACE-peptide complex. In addition, zinc atom could form metal-carboxylic coordination bond with Tyr, Met residues of P8, resulting into its high ACE inhibiting activity. Our finding indicated that the peanut peptide (P8) having a Lys-Leu-Tyr-Met-Arg-Pro amino acid sequence can be a promising candidate for functional foods and prescription drug aimed at control of hypertension.",

Due to the lack of clear-cut symptoms and optimal diagnostic method, the actual prevalence of NAFLD and its pathogenesis remains unclear, especially in the early stages of progression. In the presented work confocal Raman microspectroscopy was used to investigate alterations in the chemical composition of the NAFLD-affected liver. We have investigated two NAFLD models, representative for macrovesicular and microvesicular steatosis, induced by High Fat Diet (60 kcal %) and Low Carbohydrate High Protein Diet (LCHP), respectively. In both models we confirmed the development of NAFLD, manifested by the presence of lipid droplets (LDs), but of different sizes. Model of macrovesicular steatosis was characterized by large LDs, whereas in the microvesicular steatosis model small droplets were found. In both models, however, we observed a significant decrease in the degree of unsaturation of lipids, in comparison to the control. In addition, for both models, the impact of medical treatment with selected drugs (perindopril and nicotinic acid, respectively) was tested, indicating a significant influence of medicine not only on the occurrence and size of the droplets, but also on their composition. In both cases the drug treatment resulted in an increase of the degree of unsaturation of lipids forming droplets.

What advances does it highlight? It highlights the potential role of neuropeptide\u00a0Y in reducing vagal neurotransmission and directly influencing ventricular myocyte excitability in the presence of \u03b2-receptor blockade. Acute myocardial infarction and congestive cardiac failure are characterized by high levels of cardiac sympathetic drive. In these conditions, sympathetic neurotransmitters such as neuropeptide\u00a0Y (NPY) can be released in addition to noradrenaline, and plasma levels correlate with infarct size and mortality. Even in the presence of \u03b2-blockers, NPY is able to bind to its own receptors located on cholinergic ganglia and ventricular myocytes. In this symposium report, I review the evidence that NPY can inhibit acetylcholine release during vagus nerve stimulation and limit the subsequent bradycardia. I also present preliminary, as yet unpublished data, demonstrating that NPY may be pro-arrhythmic by directly influencing ventricular electrophysiology. Targeting NPY receptors pharmacologically may therefore be a useful therapeutic strategy both to reduce heart rate and to prevent arrhythmias in the setting of myocardial infarction and chronic heart failure. Such medications would be expected to act synergistically with \u03b2-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and implantable cardiac devices, such as defibrillators and vagus nerve stimulators.",

Podocytes are differentiated cells necessary for the development and maintenance of the glomerular basement membrane and the capillary tufts, as well as the function of the glomerular filtration barrier. The epithelial glomerular cells express a local renin-angiotensin system (RAS) that varies in different pathological situations such as hyperglycemia or mechanical stress. RAS components have been shown to be altered in diabetic podocytopathy, and their modulation may modify diabetic nephropathy progression. Podocytes are a direct target for angiotensin II-mediated injury by altered expression and distribution of podocyte proteins. Furthermore, angiotensin II promotes podocyte injury indirectly by inducing cellular hypertrophy, increased apoptosis, and changes in the anionic charge of the glomerular basement membrane, among other effects. RAS blockade has been shown to decrease the level of proteinuria and delay the progression of chronic kidney disease. This review summarizes the local intraglomerular RAS and its imbalance in diabetic podocytopathy. A better understanding of the intrapodocyte RAS might provide a new approach for diabetic kidney disease treatment.", 
    "108": "Both the processing and release of secretory granules involve water movement across granule membranes. It was hypothesized that the water channel aquaporin (AQP)1 directly contributes to the recruitment of renin-positive cells in the afferent arteriole. AQP1(-/-) and AQP1(+/+) mice were fed a low-salt (LS) diet [0.004% (wt/wt) NaCl] for 7 days and given enalapril [angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), 0.1 mg/ml] in drinking water for 3 days. There were no differences in plasma renin concentration at baseline. After LS-ACEI, plasma renin concentrations increased markedly in both genotypes but was significantly lower in AQP1(-/-) mice compared with AQP1(+/+) mice. Tissue renin concentrations were higher in AQP1(-/-) mice, and renin mRNA levels were not different between genotypes. Mean arterial blood pressure was not different at baseline and during LS diet but decreased significantly in both genotypes after the addition of ACEI; the response was faster in AQP1(-/-) mice but then stabilized at a similar level. Renin release after 200 \u03bcl blood withdrawal was not different. Isoprenaline-stimulated renin release from isolated perfused kidneys did not differ between genotypes. Cortical tissue norepinephrine concentrations were lower after LS-ACEI compared with baseline with no difference between genotypes. Plasma nitrite/nitrate concentrations were unaffected by genotype and LS-ACEI. In AQP1(-/-) mice, the number of afferent arterioles with recruitment was significantly lower compared with AQP1(+/+) mice after LS-ACEI. We conclude that AQP1 is not necessary for acutely stimulated renin secretion in vivo and from isolated perfused kidneys, whereas recruitment of renin-positive cells in response to chronic stimulation is attenuated or delayed in AQP1(-/-) mice.",

CVD and kidney disease are closely interrelated and disease of one organ cause dysfunction of the other, ultimately leading to the failure of both organs. Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are at much higher risk of mortality due to CVD. Traditional CVD risk factors viz., hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes do not account for the high cardiovascular risk in CKD patients and also standard clinical interventions for managing CVD that are successful in the general population, are ineffective to lower the death rate in CKD patients. Nontraditional factors, related to disturbed mineral and vitamin D metabolism were able to provide some explanation in terms of vascular calcification, for the increased risk of CVD in CKD. Fibroblast Growth Factor 23, a bone-derived hormone that regulates vitamin D synthesis in renal proximal tubules and renal phosphate reabsorption, has been suggested to be the missing link between CKD and CVD. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is strongly related to the progress of CVD and its early diagnosis and treatment has significant positive effect on the outcomes of CVD in the affected patients. Besides this, non-dialysable protein-bound uraemic toxins such as indoxyl sulfate and p-cresyl sulfate, produced by colonic microbes from dietary amino acids, appear to cause renal dysfunction. Thus, therapeutic approaches targeting colonic microbiota, have led to new prospects in early intervention for CKD patients. Intervention targets for preventing CVD events in CKD patients ideally should include control of blood pressure and dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, lowering proteinuria, correction of anemia, management of mineral metabolism abnormalities and life style changes including smoking cessation, decreased consumption of salt, and achievement of normal body mass index. Use of \u03b2-blockers, renin-angiotensin blockers, diuretics, statins, and aspirin are helpful in the early stages of CKD. In this review, we will address the biological, pathological and clinical relationship between CVD and CKD and their therapeutic management.", 
    "114": "The Renin-Angiotensin system plays an important role in the regulation of systemic blood pressure as well as in fluid and electrolyte balance. It is divided into two described axes, the ACE - Ang II - AT1 receptor, with Ang II as the main mediator, and the ACE2 - Ang-(1-7) - Mas receptor, with Ang-(1-7) responsible for the main effects. The main vascular effect induced by Ang II is contraction, while Ang-(1-7) includes relaxation in several vascular beds. Ang II also activates several cytokines that are important in the genesis of vascular inflammation and hypertrophy. In this context, Ang-(1-7) seems to have a protective role. Both AT1 and Mas receptors modulate, in different ways, the generation of, which are involved in the control of vascular tone and the genesis of vascular dysfunction triggered by several diseases, including diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension and atherosclerosis.

Sixteen months later she was found in cardiorespiratory arrest and died on arrival in hospital. The last transcranial Doppler scan performed 6 months before her death and a brain MRI were reported normal. The autopsy discovered massive subarachnoid haemorrhage in association with vascular damage in the circle of Willis arteries.

    "122": "Coronary atherosclerosis progresses both as slow, gradual enlargement of focal plaque and also as a more dynamic process with periodic abrupt changes in plaque geometry, size, and morphology. Systemic vasculoprotective therapies such as statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and antiplatelet agents are the cornerstone of prevention of plaque rupture and new adverse clinical outcomes, but such systemic therapies are insufficient to prevent the majority of new cardiac events. Invasive imaging methods have been able to identify both the anatomic features of high-risk plaque and the ongoing pathobiological stimuli responsible for progressive plaque inflammation and instability and may provide sufficient information to formulate preventive local mechanical strategies (eg, preemptive percutaneous coronary interventions) to avert cardiac events. Local endothelial shear stress (ESS) triggers vascular phenomena that synergistically exacerbate atherosclerosis toward an unstable phenotype. Specifically, low ESS augments lipid uptake and catabolism, induces plaque inflammation and oxidation, downregulates the production, upregulates the degradation of extracellular matrix, and increases cellular apoptosis ultimately leading to thin-cap fibroatheromas and/or endothelial erosions. Increases in blood thrombogenicity that result from either high or low ESS also contribute to plaque destabilization. An understanding of the actively evolving vascular phenomena, as well as the development of in vivo imaging methodologies to identify the presence and severity of the different processes, may enable early identification of a coronary plaque destined to acquire a high-risk state and allow for highly selective, focal preventive interventions to avert the adverse natural history of that particular plaque. In this review, we focus on the role of ESS in the pathobiologic processes responsible for plaque destabilization, leading either to accelerated plaque growth or to acute coronary events, and emphasize the potential to utilize in vivo risk stratification of individual coronary plaques to optimize prevention strategies to preclude new cardiac events.",

To investigate the impact of genetic influences on postpartum haemorrhage, in association with maternal and intrapartum risk factors, using a candidate gene approach. All women (n\u00a0=\u00a06694) who underwent a vaginal delivery at the Obstetric Unit of a large University hospital in Milan (Italy) between July 2007 and September 2009 were enrolled. The first consecutive 3219 women entered the genetic study. Postpartum haemorrhage was defined as \u2265500\u00a0mL blood loss. Eight functional polymorphisms in seven candidate genes were chosen because of their potential role in predisposing to or protecting from haemorrhagic conditions: tissue factor (F3), factor V (F5), tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), platelet glycoprotein Ia/IIa (ITGA2), prothrombin (F2), platelet glycoproteins Ib\u03b1 (GP1BA) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). After correction for the already known PPH risk factors, only the promoter polymorphism of the tissue factor gene (F3 -603A>G) showed a significant association with PPH, the G allele exerting a protective effect (P\u00a0=\u00a00.00053; OR\u00a0=\u00a00.79, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.69-0.90).

The effect of BP changes from baseline in relation with the subsequent risk of stroke and myocardial infarction (MI) is unknown. Of the 25 620 patients randomized in the Ongoing Telmisartan Alone and in combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET) study, we selected 19 102 patients with coronary artery disease at baseline. BP at entry was 141/82 mm Hg, and its average decrease during follow-up was 7/6 mm Hg. BP entered the analysis as time-varying variable modeled with restricted cubic splines. After adjustment for several potential determinants of reverse causality, a change in BP from baseline by -34/-21 mm Hg (10th percentile) was associated with a lesser risk of stroke without any significant increase in the risk of MI. A rise in systolic/diastolic BP from baseline by 20/10 mm Hg (90th percentile) was associated with an increased risk of stroke, whereas the risk of MI increased with systolic BP and not with diastolic BP. In conclusion, in patients with coronary artery disease and initially free from congestive heart failure, a BP reduction from baseline over the examined BP range had little effect on the risk of MI and predicted a lower risk of stroke. An increase in systolic BP from baseline increased the risk of stroke and MI. The relationships of BP with risk were much steeper for stroke than for MI. A treatment-induced BP reduction over the explored range seems to be safe in patients with coronary artery disease.",

The current treatment threshold for hypertensive adults without diabetes or cardiovascular or renal disease is blood pressure above 160/100 mmHg or 160/90 mmHg, with some uncertainty over which diastolic threshold should be used. Apart from certain diuretic-based combinations, the use of combinations of antihypertensive drugs as first-line therapy has not been evaluated in terms of the complications of hypertension. A number of systematic reviews with meta-analyses of data on tens of thousands of patients have compared the main classes of antihypertensive drugs against each other and against placebo. Compared with placebo, only low-dose thiazide diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to reduce all-cause mortality in hypertensive patients. They prevented about 2 to 3 deaths and 2 strokes per 100 patients treated for 4 to 5 years. Several systematic reviews concluded that neither calcium-channel blockers, ACE inhibitors nor beta-blockers are more effective than thiazide diuretics in reducing mortality or the incidence of stroke. The efficacy of the thiazide diuretic chlortalidone is supported by the highest-level evidence, from three comparative clinical trials versus placebo, an ACE inhibitor, or a calcium-channel blocker, in more than 50 000 patients. In one of these trials, chlortalidone was superior to the ACE inhibitor lisinoprilin preventing stroke. It was also superior to the calcium-channel blocker amlodipine in preventing heart failure. The effect of hydrochlorothiazide, combined with amiloride or triamterene, on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has been demonstrated in three comparative clinical trials versus placebo, a beta-blocker, or a calcium-channel blocker. Hydrochlorothiazide appeared more effective than the beta-blocker atenolol in reducing the incidence of coronary events. The addition of a potassium-sparing diuretic (amiloride or triamterene) to first-line hydrochlorothiazide therapy has not been demonstrated to provide clinical benefit. The evaluation of indapamide, another thiazide diuretic, is less convincing. Since no head-to-head trials have been conducted, there is no evidence that it is more effective than chlortalidone or hydrochlorothiazide. None of the antihypertensive drugs appears to have a better overall adverse effect profile than the others. Thiazide diuretics can provoke hyperglycaemia and diabetes, although this does not reduce their efficacy in the prevention of cardiovascular events. As of early 2014, the first-choice treatment for hypertension in nondiabetic adults without cardiovascular or renal disease should be chlortalidone. If chlortalidone is not available, it appears reasonable to choose another thiazide diuretic, hydrochlorothiazide, possibly combined with amiloride or triamterene. When a diuretic cannot be used, it is better to choose an ACE inhibitor: captopril, lisinopril or ramipril.",

However, its effect is occasionally not sufficient and additional treatments may be required. Recently, we reported that nicorandil exhibited renoprotective effects in a mouse model of diabetic nephropathy. Here we examined if nicorandil can provide an additive protection on enalapril in chronic kidney disease. Single treatment with either enalapril or nicorandil significantly ameliorated glomerular and tubulointerstitial injury in the rat remnant kidney while the combination of these two compounds provided additive effects. In addition, an increase in oxidative stress in remnant kidney was also blocked by either enalapril or nicorandil while the combination of the drugs was more potent. A mechanism was likely due for nicorandil to preventing manganase superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and sirtuin (Sirt)3 from being reduced in injured kidneys. A study with cultured podocytes indicated that the antioxidative effect could be mediated through sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) in the mitochondrial KATP channel since blocking SUR with glibenclamide reduced MnSOD and Sirt3 expression in podocytes. In conclusion, nicorandil may synergize with enalapril to provide superior protection in chronic kidney disease.",

The brain damage intensity during hypoperfusion of reperfusion period was measured by analyzing its damage markers. It was determined that the activation of kinins' formation by tripsin has a detrimental effect during ischemia/reperfusion of brain, producing an early development of hypoperfusion in reperfusion period, aggravating a brain damage. The depression of kinins' disruption by ACE-inhibitors leads to superfluous decreasing of local cerebral blood flow during hypoperfusion of reperfusion period. The inhibition of kinins' formation by contrykal improves the flow of reperfusion period, preventing the appearance of hypoperfusion and decreasing the brain damage intensity in comparison with a control group. On the whole an activation of the kinin system during ischemia/reperfusion of brain plays mostly pathogenetic role making worse the flow of reperfusion period and aggravating a brain damage.",

Conversely, AVR was protective (hazard ratio 0.25, p = 0.01). The magnitude of the protective effect of AVR seemed to be relatively more important in patients with atrial fibrillation than in those in sinus rhythm, independently of the severity of symptoms. Age >70 years showed a trend toward being a prognostic predictor (p = 0.082). In conclusion, in patients with low-gradient aortic stenosis despite a preserved left ventricular ejection fraction, AVR was strongly correlated with a better prognosis.

Patients with higher uric acid levels were older, previous smokers, with higher prevalence of hypertension and diabetes, but with lower family history of CAD. They had more often history of a previous CABG and baseline renal dysfunction. Patients of the third Tertile had also higher levels of white blood cells, higher triglycerides and lower HDL-cholesterol and higher percentage of dilated cardiomyopathy/valvular disease as indication for angiography and consequently a lower prevalence of PCI. Patients with higher SUA were more often on therapy with ACE inhibitors and diuretics, but less often with statins, nitrate, ASA and Clopidogrel at admission.

It is, however, unclear whether non-nephrotic proteinuria at the time of diagnosis is also associated with good prognosis since a reasonable number of these patients develop nephrotic syndrome despite blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. No clinical or laboratory parameters are available, which allow the assessment of risk for development of nephrotic proteinuria. Phospholipase A2 Receptor antibodies (PLA2R-Ab) play a prominent role in the pathogenesis of primary MN and are associated with persistence of nephrotic proteinuria. In this study we analysed whether PLA2R-Ab levels might predict development of nephrotic syndrome and the clinical outcome in 33 patients with biopsy-proven primary MN and non-nephrotic proteinuria under treatment with blockers of the renin-angiotensin system. PLA2R-Ab levels, proteinuria and serum creatinine were measured every three months. Nephrotic-range proteinuria developed in 18 (55%) patients. At study start (1.2\u00b11.5 months after renal biopsy and time of diagnosis), 16 (48%) patients were positive for PLA2R-Ab.

We sought to identify which patients benefit most from such treatment in a large clinical trial in type 2 diabetes mellitus. In Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron MR Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE) participants (n=11 140), we estimated the individual patient 5-year absolute risk of major adverse cardiovascular events with and without treatment by perindopril-indapamide (4/1.25 mg). The difference between treated and untreated risk is the estimated individual patient's absolute risk reduction (ARR). Predictions were based on a Cox proportional hazards model inclusive of demographic and clinical characteristics together with the observed relative treatment effect. The group-level effect of selectively treating patients with an estimated ARR above a range of decision thresholds was compared with treating everyone or those with a blood pressure >140/90 mm Hg using net benefit analysis. In ADVANCE, there was wide variation in treatment effects across individual patients. According to the algorithm, 43% of patients had a large predicted 5-year ARR of \u22651% (number-needed-to-treat [NNT5] \u2264100) and 40% had an intermediate predicted ARR of 0.5% to 1% (NNT5=100-`200).

The objective was to explore the effect of high hydrostatic pressure (HP) on proteolysis by different proteases and the release of bioactive peptides from lentil proteins. Pressurisation (100-300 MPa) enhanced the hydrolytic efficiency of Protamex, Savinase and Corolase 7089 compared to Alcalase. Proteolysis at 300 MPa led to a complete degradation of lentil proteins and increased peptide (<3 kDa) concentration by all enzymes. Proteolysis at 300 MPa by Savinase gave rise to lentil hydrolysates (S300) with the highest ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant activities that were retained upon in vitro gastrointestinal digestion. The peptides responsible for the multifunctional properties of S300 hydrolysate were identified as different fragments from storage proteins and the allergen Len c 1.

The ATP content of the reperfused tissue was significantly elevated after captopril treatment compared to control group (24 \u00b1 2 vs. 16 \u00b1 2 \u03bcmol/g, p = 0.033), whereas the level of MDA was substantially decreased (0.58 \u00b1 0.163 vs. 1.5 \u00b1 0.28 \u03bcmol/g, p = 0.009). ACE inhibition leads to a significantly greater and faster recovery of myocardial contractility after prolonged cardiac arrest with Bretschneider solution. Due to decreased oxygen consumption, myocardial protection is enhanced. The association between ACE and ischemia cannot be clarified by selective blockade of angiotensin-II receptor type 1 (AT1-R) or ETa receptor (ETa-R).",

The structures of the most potent peptides were identified as Val-Glu-Leu-Tyr-Pro, Ala-Phe-Val-Gly-Tyr-Val-Leu-Pro and Glu-Lys-Ser-Tyr-Glu-Leu-Pro. The first peptide displayed the highest ACE inhibitory activity with an IC50 of 5.22\u03bcM. Lineweaver-Burk plots suggest that Val-Glu-Leu-Tyr-Pro acts as a non-competitive inhibitor against ACE.

The Medline, Cochrane Library and Embase databases were searched for clinical studies published up to May 2014. Studies that evaluated the effects of preoperative RASI therapy in cardiac surgery were included. Odds ratio (OR) estimates were generated under a random-effects model. After a literature search in the major databases, 18 studies were identified [three randomized prospective clinical trials (RCTs) and 15 observational trials] that reported outcomes of 54 528 cardiac surgery patients with (n = 22 661; 42%) or without (n = 31 867; 58%) preoperative RASI therapy.

The mortality rate in patients with ARVD is high, especially with other cardiovascular or renal comorbidities. Recent clinical studies have provided substantial evidence concerning medical therapy and endovascular interventional therapeutic approaches for ARVD. Despite previous randomized clinical trials, the optimal therapy for ARVD remained uncertain until the results of the Cardiovascular Outcomes in Renal Atherosclerotic Lesions (CORAL) trial were released recently.

Whether this side effect might represent a class effect of all DPP-4 inhibitors remains to be seen. Results of randomized prospective multicenter trials with the DPP-4 inhibitors alogliptin and vildagliptin have in fact generated new uncertainties and clearly not totally excluded the possibility of a class side effect. A meta-analysis of 59 randomized controlled trials with various DPP-4 inhibitors evaluating data from 36,620 patients with diabetes and a minimal observation period of 24\u00a0weeks, confirmed a 21\u00a0% increase of heart failure events compared to placebo treatment, however, not in comparison to treatment with other blood glucose lowering drugs. German registry data also did not show an increased risk for heart failure for the latter comparison. Potential interactions of DPP-4 inhibitors with other drugs, e.g. ACE inhibitors, have been discussed in relation to the increased heart failure risk, as well as interactions with peptides regulating cardiovascular functions that are also split by DPP-4 enzymes such as BNP, substance P, and NPY. Results from ongoing large multicenter trials with the DPP-4 inhibitors sitagliptin and linagliptin are expected to clarify the potential heart failure issue related to treatment with DPP-4 inhibitors.",

His identical twin brother (T2), on subsequent investigation, harbours a compositionally identical lesion in a proximal coronary vessel that has not yet ruptured or provoked a clinical event.

Two common antihypertensive drug classes including thiazide diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors affect different enzymes in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). In the RAAS, angiotensinogen is converted into angiotensin II which increases blood pressure through vasoconstriction. Using a case-only design with 3448 high-risk hypertensive individuals from the Genetics of Hypertension Associated Treatment (GenHAT) study, we examined whether seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the angiotensinogen gene (AGT) interact with three classes of antihypertensive drugs including chlorthalidone (a thiazide diuretic), lisinopril (an ACE inhibitor), and amlodipine (a calcium channel blocker) to modify the risk of incident coronary heart disease (CHD) and heart failure (HF) among Caucasian and African American participants, separately. We found no gene by treatment interactions to be statistically significant after correction for multiple testing. However, some suggestive results were found. African American participants with the minor allele of rs11122576 had over two-fold higher risk of CHD when using chlorthalidone compared to using amlodipine, or lisinopril compared to amlodipine (p = 0.006 and p = 0.01, respectively). Other marginal associations are also reported among both race groups. The findings reported here suggest that rs11122576 could contribute to future personalization of antihypertensive treatment among African Americans though more studies are needed.",

Seventy-one of the 564 patients in the total cohort were on \u03b2-blockers. They were older, had higher prevalence of comorbidities, and were more often on diuretics, digoxin, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. The severity of PAH and right ventricular failure was similar between those with and without \u03b2-blocker use.

The current study attempted to demonstrate the role of insulin receptor substrate-2 (Irs2) in endothelial cells with regard to insulin secretion. Endothelial cell-specific Irs2 knockout (ETIrs2KO) mice exhibited impaired glucose-induced, arginine-induced, and glucagon-induced insulin secretion and showed glucose intolerance. In batch incubation and perifusion experiments using isolated islets, glucose-induced insulin secretion was not significantly different between the control and the ETIrs2KO mice. In contrast, in perfusion experiments, glucose-induced insulin secretion was significantly impaired in the ETIrs2KO mice. The islet blood flow was significantly impaired in the ETIrs2KO mice. After the treatment of these knockout mice with enalapril maleate, which improved the islet blood flow, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was almost completely restored to levels equal to those in the control mice. These data suggest that Irs2 deletion in endothelial cells leads to a decreased islet blood flow, which may cause impaired glucose-induced insulin secretion. Thus, Irs2 in endothelial cells may serve as a novel therapeutic target for preventing and ameliorating type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome.",

However, the management of arterial hypertension is still insufficient and more efforts are needed to improve both non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatment of this widely prevalent disease.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and/or sartans block RAAS incompletely. Aliskiren is one of the novel drugs that has been introduced to antihypertensive therapy recently. Up to now no trial has confirmed that aliskiren is efficacious in reducing cardiovascular events. Double RAAS blockade with aliskiren was not always safe.

Older adults (n = 7396) had a longer history of hypertension (8.7 vs 4.7 years; P < 0.0001), lower mean diastolic blood pressure (DBP; 87.7 \u00b1 11.0 vs 92.1 \u00b1 11.0 mm Hg) and more renal (12.0 vs 5.6%; P < 0.0001) or cardiovascular disease (44.0 vs 18.9%; P < 0.0001); 4548 received aliskiren (68.8%), 1215 ACEi/ARBs (18.4%) and 850 non-RAS treatments (12.9%). Office BP at 1 year was reduced by 18.4 \u00b1 21.5/7.2 \u00b1 12.0 mm Hg. BP reductions were greater (19.5 \u00b1 21.7/7.6 \u00b1 12.1 mm Hg) in the aliskiren group than in the ACEi/ARB (15.6 \u00b1 20.9/6.4 \u00b1 11.9) and non-RAS groups (16.1 \u00b1 20.7/6.5 \u00b1 11.7 mm Hg), respectively (P<0.0001 for systolic BP (SBP) and <0.01 for DBP). After multivariable adjustment, differences in SBP reductions were clinically irrelevant and no differences were noted for DBP. Adverse effects were higher in older adults with no differences between treatment groups. In conclusion, the present analysis of a large, unselected cohort of patients in clinical practice from the 3A study, offers real-life evidence of the effectiveness and safety of aliskiren for the treatment of hypertension in older adults.",

Male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with FURO+CAP combined with bilateral injections of vehicle or moxonidine (0.5 nmol/0.2 \u03bcl) into the LPBN. Bilateral injections of moxonidine into the LPBN increased FURO+CAP-induced 1.8% NaCl intake, without changing water intake.

Streptozotocin (55mg/kg, i.p., once)-administered diabetic rats were allowed for 10 weeks to develop nephropathy. Diabetic rats after 10 weeks developed nephropathy with discernible renal structural and functional changes as assessed in terms of increase in kidney weight to body weight ratio (KW/BW), and elevations of serum creatinine, urea and uric acid, which accompanied with elevated serum triglycerides and decreased high-density lipoproteins. Hematoxylin-eosin, periodic acid Schiff and Masson trichrome staining confirmed renal pathological changes in diabetic rats that included glomerular capsular wall distortion, mesangial cell expansion, glomerular microvascular condensation, tubular damage and degeneration and fibrosis. Low-dose fenofibrate (30mg/kg, p.o., 4 weeks) and low-dose dipyridamole (20mg/kg, p.o., 4 weeks) treatment either alone or in combination considerably reduced renal structural and functional abnormalities in diabetic rats, but without affecting the elevated glucose level. Fenofibrate, but not dipyridamole, significantly prevented the lipid alteration and importantly the uric acid elevation in diabetic rats. Lisinopril (5mg/kg, p.o., 4 weeks, reference compound), prevented the hyperglycemia, lipid alteration and development of diabetic nephropathy. Lipid alteration and uric acid elevation, besides hyperglycemia, could play key roles in the development of nephropathy.

Although \u03b2 blockers have long been used for the treatment of SCHD, their efficacy was established in the era before widespread use of reperfusion interventions, modern medical therapy (e.g., angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers), or preventive treatments (e.g., aspirin, statins). On the basis of these older data, \u03b2 blockers are assumed beneficial, and their use has been extrapolated beyond patients with heart failure and previous myocardial infarction, which provided the best evidence for efficacy. However, there are no randomized clinical trials demonstrating that \u03b2 blockers decrease clinical events in patients with SCHD in the modern era. Furthermore, these agents are associated with weight gain, problems with glycemic control, fatigue, and bronchospasm, underscoring the fact that their use is not without risk. In conclusion, data are currently lacking to support the widespread use of \u03b2 blockers for all SCHD patients, but contemporary data suggest that they be reserved for a well-defined high-risk group of patients with evidence of ongoing ischemia, left ventricular dysfunction, heart failure, and perhaps some arrhythmias.",

The disproportionally greater decrease in systolic office BP compared with ABP was dependent on the level of the pretreatment BP, which was consistently higher for office BP than ABP. The white coat effect (difference between office BP and ABP) was on average 10/5 mm Hg lower 1 year after intensifying treatment and the magnitude of that was also dependent on pretreatment BP.

Renal manifestations include varying degrees of kidney injury, urinary tract infections, kidney stones, and hematuria. Extrarenal manifestations can include pain, hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, hepatic cysts, intracranial aneurysm, diverticulosis, and abdominal and inguinal hernias. The progression of ADPKD cannot be reversed with current treatment modalities; therefore, therapies target the resulting clinical manifestations. Early detection and management of hypertension are important to delay the progression of renal dysfunction and development of cardiovascular complications. Pain management includes evaluation of concomitant illnesses, use of analgesics, and adjuvant therapy. Fluoroquinolones may be the most useful class of antibiotics for the treatment of urinary tract infections because of their lipophilic properties and bactericidal action against gram-negative pathogens. Nephrolithiasis is twice as common in persons with ADPKD compared with the general population and is suggested by flank pain with or without hematuria. Cystic hemorrhages usually resolve within one week, although microscopic hematuria may still be present. Because of the proliferative effect of estrogen on hepatic cysts, oral contraceptives containing estrogen and menopausal estrogen therapy should be administered at the lowest effective dose or avoided in patients with ADPKD. Intracranial aneurysms are at least twice as common in patients with ADPKD than in the general population. Renal ultrasonography is the diagnostic modality of choice to screen at-risk individuals for ADPKD.",

    "335": "The purpose of the present review article is to update the information regarding pharmacokinetics of drugs in patients with heart failure that has accumulated since the last review article published in 1988 in Clinical Pharmacokinetics. Since this last review, our understanding of the pathophysiology of heart failure has changed from the cardio-renal model to the neuro-humoral model, and the pharmacologic approach to treatment of heart failure has been shifted from inotropic agents to those acting on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. The pharmacologic agents now used for heart failure include many important classes of drugs, such as ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (antagonists) (ARBs), and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. In Part 1 of this review, we summarized the pharmacokinetic properties of relevant drugs administered intravenously. In Part 2, the present article, we describe pharmacokinetics of drugs following oral administration. For this purpose we conducted a systematic search of literature using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Japan Centra Revuo Medicina (in Japanese). We retrieved a total of 110 relevant publications for 49 drugs and updated the information for ten drugs and provided new information for 31 drugs. We recognized that the pharmacokinetic data were obtained primarily from stable heart failure patients with moderate severity [New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II or III]. In addition, most patients were classified as heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Furthermore, because most of the studies retrieved had no comparative groups of healthy subjects or patients without heart failure, historical controls from previous studies were used for comparisons. In Part 2, we also discuss the pharmacokinetics of active metabolites as well as parent drugs, because many drugs given by oral administration for the treatment of heart failure are prodrugs (e.g., ACE inhibitors and ARBs). The pharmacokinetic changes of drugs in patients with heart failure are discussed in the light of a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model. In addition, we discuss the effects of intestinal tissue heart failure-associated edema on drug absorption as it relates to the biopharmaceutical classification system, particularly for drugs demonstrating reduced systemic exposure as measured by the area under the plasma concentration-time curve after oral administration (AUCpo) in patients with heart failure as compared with healthy subjects. After review of the available data, it was seen that among patients with asymptomatic or compensated chronic heart failure there seemed to be no or minimal alterations in the maximum concentration (C max) and AUCpo of the included drugs, unless there was concurrent liver and/or renal dysfunction. In contrast, the AUCpo of at least 14 drugs (captopril, cilazaprilat, enalapril/enalaprilat, perindopril, carvedilol, candesartan, pilsicainide, felodipine, furosemide, enoximone, milrinone, flosequinan, molsidomine, and ibopamine) were suspected or documented to increase after oral administration by 50% or more in patients with symptomatic or decompensated heart failure.", 
    "336": "Right ventricular (RV) function after ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) has important prognostic implications. However, the changes in RV function over time after STEMI and the incidence of RV remodeling remain unknown. The present study evaluated changes in RV dimensions and function in contemporary patients with first STEMI and assessed the independent determinants of RV dysfunction at follow-up. Patients with first STEMI (n = 940, 60 \u00b1 11 years, 77% men) treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention underwent echocardiography at baseline and 6- and 12-month follow-up. The prevalence of RV dysfunction (tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion [TAPSE] \u226415 mm) decreased significantly at 6 months follow-up (from 15% to 8%, p <0.001) and the incidence of RV remodeling (increase in RV end-diastolic area [RVEDA] \u226520%) was observed in 200 patients (25%). Absolute changes in RVEDA were independently associated with absolute changes in wall motion score index and left ventricular (LV) remodeling (p <0.001 for both parameters), whereas absolute changes in TAPSE were independently related with absolute changes in wall motion score index and mitral regurgitation grade (p <0.001 for both parameters). Independent correlates of RV dysfunction at 6 months follow-up were multivessel coronary disease (odds ratio [OR] 2.13), peak cardiac troponin T (OR 1.05), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin receptor blockers use (OR 0.27), baseline LV ejection fraction (OR 0.96) and baseline TAPSE (OR 0.88). In conclusion, despite the non-negligible incidence of RV remodeling in patients with first STEMI, RV function improves early after STEMI. Multivessel coronary disease, infarct size, baseline LV ejection fraction and TAPSE and the nonuse of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin receptor blockers are independent determinants of RV dysfunction.",

Based on the echocardiographic left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), patients were divided into 2 groups, group 1 (<50%) and group 2 (\u226550%). Of 2212 patients with HF, 20% were in group 2. Patients in group 2 were more likely to be older, females, Arabs, hypertensive, and obese (P = .001). Patients in group 1 were mostly Asians and had more troponin-T positivity (P = .001). Inhospital cardiac arrest, shock, and deaths were significantly greater in group 1. On multivariate analysis, age, ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, lack of on-admission \u03b2-blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors use were independent predictors of mortality. HFPEF is associated with less mortality compared to those who presented with reduced LVEF. On admission, use of evidence-based medications could in part predict this difference in the hospital outcome.",

Males younger than age ten years may manifest only low molecular-weight (LMW) proteinuria and/or hypercalciuria, which are usually asymptomatic. Thirty to 80% of affected males develop end-stage renal disease (ESRD) between ages 30 and 50 years; in some instances ESRD does not develop until the sixth decade of life or later. Rickets or osteomalacia are occasionally observed, and mild short stature, although underappreciated, may be a common occurrence. Disease severity can vary within the same family. Males with Dent disease 2 (caused by mutation of OCRL) are at increased risk for intellectual disability. Due to random X-chromosome inactivation, some female carriers may manifest hypercalciuria and, rarely, renal calculi and moderate LMW proteinuria. Females rarely if ever develop CKD.", 
    "339": "The diagnosis is based on renal findings and/or a family history consistent with X-linked inheritance. A pathogenic variant in CLCN5 accounts for approximately 60% of those with Dent disease (known as Dent disease 1); a pathogenic variant in OCRL accounts for approximately 15% of those with Dent disease (known as Dent disease 2).", 
    "340": "Treatment of manifestations: The primary goals of treatment are to decrease hypercalciuria, prevent kidney stones and nephrocalcinosis, and delay the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). No randomized controlled trials have been performed. Although thiazide diuretics can decrease urinary calcium excretion in boys with Dent disease, side effects limit their use. The effectiveness of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) in children with proteinuria to prevent or delay further loss of kidney function is unclear. Renal replacement therapy is necessary in those with ESRD. Prevention of secondary complications: Bone disease, when present, responds to vitamin D supplementation and phosphorus repletion. Growth failure may be treated with human growth hormone without adversely affecting kidney function. Surveillance: Monitor at least annually urinary calcium excretion, renal function (glomerular filtration rate [GFR]), and the parameters used to stage CKD (i.e., blood pressure, hematocrit/hemoglobin, and serum calcium and phosphorous concentrations). Monitor more frequently when CKD is evident. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Exposure to potential renal toxins (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, aminoglycoside antibiotics, and intravenous contrast agents). Evaluation of relatives at risk: Clarify the genetic status of at-risk male relatives either by molecular genetic testing (if the pathogenic variant in the family is known) or by measurement of urinary excretion of low molecular-weight proteins (LMWPs).", 
    "341": "Dent disease is inherited in an X-linked manner. The father of an affected male will not have the disease nor will he be a carrier of the pathogenic variant. If the mother of the proband has a pathogenic variant, the chance of transmitting it in each pregnancy is 50%. Males who inherit the pathogenic variant will be affected; females who inherit the pathogenic variant will be carriers and will usually not be significantly affected. Affected males pass the pathogenic variant to all of their daughters (who become carriers) and none of their sons. Carrier testing for at-risk female relatives and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if the pathogenic variant in the family has been identified.",

In 2013, in the British Medical Journal, we described accelerated post-operative acute kidney injury (AKI) in CKD patients concurrently on 'triple whammy' medications, a new syndrome that we aptly named 'quadruple whammy'.",

Outpatient medications included Lisinopril-Hydrochlorothiazide and Nabumetone (NSAID). SCr rapidly more than doubled with metabolic acidosis and hyperkalemia within 24 hours, peaking at 4.02 mg/dL. 'Triple whammy' medications were promptly stopped and the hypotension was corrected. SCr was 1.64 mg/dL and stable, after three months. II. A 46-year-old Caucasian male, hypertensive CKD II, SCr 1.21 mg/dL, developed accelerated AKI after elective right hip arthroplasty. Outpatient medications included Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide. Celecoxib (200 mg) was given pre-operatively. Within 36 hours, SCr rapidly more than doubled to 2.58 mg/dL, with metabolic acidosis. 'Triple whammy' medications were promptly stopped and the hypotension was corrected. SCr was 0.99 mg/dL, and stable, after one month.",

We dubbed this new syndrome \"Quadruple Whammy\". It is not uncommon. 'Renoprevention', the pre-emptive withholding of (potentially nephrotoxic) medications, including 'triple whammy' medications, pre-operatively, in CKD patients, together with the simultaneous avoidance of peri-operative hypotension would help reduce, if not eliminate such AKI - a call for more pharmacovigilance.",

It is caused by vasoactive substances that produce a transient increase in endothelial permeability. Angioedema involving the laryngeal components is a life-threatening situation for the patient,and it is a challenge for the emergency medicine physician to rapidly achieve a safety airway. Most cases of laryngeal angioedema are induced by histamine release; but 10% are bradykinin induced, which does not respond to the conventional algorithm of treating allergic induced angioedema. We present a case report of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor\u2013induced laryngeal angioedema alleviated only after treatment with the new bradykinin receptor inhibitor medication icatibant which was licensed only for use in hereditary angioedema. We reviewed the literature for the use of icatibant in acquired drug-induced angioedema; and because of the similar pathogenesis between the hereditary angioedema and the ACE inhibitor\u2013induced angioedema,we propose an algorithm for careful use of icatibantin life-threatening angioedema in the emergency department.",

Carnosine treatment normalized CN1 abundance and reduced glucosuria, blood concentrations of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), carboxyl-methyl lysine (CML), N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNac; all p<0.05 vs. non-treated STZ rats), reduced cataract formation (p<0.05) and urinary albumin excretion (p<0.05), preserved podocyte number (p<0.05) and normalized the increased renal tissue CN1 protein concentration. Treatment with lisinopril had no effect on HbA1C, glucosuria, cataract formation and CN1 concentration, but reduced albumin excretion rate more effectively than carnosine treatment (p<0.05). Treatment with both carnosine and lisinopril combined the effects of single treatment, albeit without additive effect on podocyte number or albuminuria.

    "390": "Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a major safety concern during drug development and remains one of the main reasons for withdrawal of drugs from the market. Although it is crucial to develop methods that will detect potential hepatotoxicity of drug candidates as early and as quickly as possible, there is still a lack of sensitive and specific biomarkers for DILI that consequently leads to a scarcity of reliable hepatotoxic data. Hence, in this study, we assessed characteristic molecular signatures in rat liver treated with drugs (pyrazinamide, ranitidine, enalapril, carbamazepine and chlorpromazine) that are known to cause DILI in humans. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis of transcriptome changes induced by DILI-causing drugs resulted in three different subclusters on dendrogram, i.e., hepatocellular, cholestatic and mixed type of DILI at early time points (2 days), and multiclassification analysis suggested 31 genes as discernible markers for each DILI pattern. Further analysis for characteristic molecular signature of each DILI pattern provided a molecular basis for different modes of DILI action. A proteomics study of the same rat livers was used to confirm the results, and the two sets of data showed 60 matching classifiers. In conclusion, the data of different DILI-causing drug treatments from genomic analysis in a rat model suggest that DILI-specific molecular signatures can discriminate different patterns of DILI at an early exposure time point, and that they provide useful information for mechanistic studies that may lead to a better understanding of the molecular basis of DILI.",

We previously reported that decreased ACE2 expression and activity contributes to the development of Ang-II-mediated hypertension in mice. The present study aimed to investigate the mechanisms involved in ACE2 downregulation during neurogenic hypertension. In ACE2-transfected Neuro-2A cells, Ang-II treatment resulted in a significant attenuation of ACE2 enzymatic activity. Examination of the subcellular localization of ACE2 revealed that Ang-II treatment leads to ACE2 internalization and degradation into lysosomes. These effects were prevented by both the Ang-II type 1 receptor (AT1R) blocker losartan and the lysosomal inhibitor leupeptin. In contrast, in HEK293T cells, which lack endogenous AT1R, Ang-II failed to promote ACE2 internalization. Moreover, this effect could be induced after AT1R transfection. Furthermore, coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that AT1R and ACE2 form complexes, and these interactions were decreased by Ang-II treatment, which also enhanced ACE2 ubiquitination. In contrast, ACE2 activity was not changed by transfection of AT2 or Mas receptors. In vivo, Ang-II-mediated hypertension was blunted by chronic infusion of leupeptin in wildtype C57Bl/6, but not in ACE2 knockout mice. Overall, this is the first demonstration that elevated Ang-II levels reduce ACE2 expression and activity by stimulation of lysosomal degradation through an AT1R-dependent mechanism.",

Recent data demonstrated that moderately lower sodium intake in CKD patients is associated with substantially better long-term outcome of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)-blockade, in diabetic and nondiabetic CKD, related to better effects of RAAS-blockade on proteinuria, independent of blood pressure. This is in line with better short-term efficacy of RAAS-blockade during moderate sodium restriction in diabetic and nondiabetic CKD. This effect of sodium restriction is likely mediated by its effects on volume status. Sustainable sodium restriction can be achieved by approaches on the basis of behavioral sciences.",

In this study, we investigated antihypertensive mechanisms of six BPL peptides isolated from neo-FBS (FBPs) by a vasorelaxation assay and conventional in vitro, in vivo, and a new ex vivo ACE inhibitory assays. Some FBPs demonstrated moderate endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation in SHR thoracic aorta and all FBPs mildly inhibited ACE in vitro. Orally administered FBPs strongly inhibited ACE in SHR tissues. To investigate detailed ACE-inhibitory mechanism of FBPs in living body tissues, we performed the ex vivo assay by using endothelium-denuded thoracic aorta rings isolated from SHRs, which demonstrated that FBPs at low concentration effectively inhibited ACE in thoracic aorta tissue and suppressed angiotensin II-mediated vasoconstriction directly associated with BPL. These results indicate that the main BPL mechanism of FBP was ACE inhibition in living body tissues, suggesting that high FBP's bioavailability including absorption, tissue affinity, and tissue accumulation was responsible for the superior ACE inhibition in vivo. We propose that our ex vivo assay is an efficient and reliable method for evaluating ACE-inhibitory mechanism responsible for BPL activity in vivo.",

One subgroup received estrogen plus progestin therapy (EPT+), the other subgroup received no hormone replacement (EPT-). Combined hormone replacement with transdermal patches releasing 17\u03b2-estradiol and norethisterone was used. Office and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure was measured at baseline and during follow-up. Renal plasma flow (RPF) was measured using the clearance of [125I]-iodohippuran. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) was determined with an automatic device.",

Perindopril (4\u00a0mg/day) and hydrochlorothiazide (25\u00a0mg/day) were equally effective in reducing blood pressure in postmenopausal, hypertensive subjects. In these females, perindopril increased RPF and decreased PWV and plasma insulin levels. These effects of the ACEI were not altered by estrogen plus progestin therapy. Hydrochlorothiazide decreased RPF and increased plasma insulin and uric acid concentrations in hypertensive subjects whom were not receiving estrogen plus progestin therapy.",

Though left atrial pressure is often monitored during test occlusion of a defect, it is not clear at what cut-off value device implantation is contraindicated. We report successful closure of an atrial septal defect in a 73-year-old patient, even though the mean left atrial pressure increased from 18 to 25\u2005mm\u2005Hg with device implantation. Although a fenestrated device was used, this did not prevent the rise in left atrial pressure. The patient was supported with mechanical ventilation, milrinone and intravenous diuretics following the procedure and did not develop pulmonary oedema. Her dyspnoea improved and her functional status increased from New York Heart Association (NYHA) III to NYHA II. In conclusion, successful device closure can be accomplished even with high left atrial pressure.",

However, HS impaired whole body and skeletal muscle glucose uptake, in addition to a loss of insulin-stimulated microvascular recruitment. These effects were present despite enhanced insulin signalling (Akt) in both liver and skeletal muscle. Constant-flow pump-perfused hindlimb experiments revealed normal insulin-stimulated myocyte glucose uptake in HS-fed rats. Quinapril treatment restored insulin-mediated microvascular recruitment and muscle glucose uptake in vivo.",

CUSP9* drugs--aprepitant, artesunate, auranofin, captopril, celecoxib, disulfiram, itraconazole, sertraline, ritonavir, are all widely approved by regulatory authorities, marketed for non-cancer indications. Each drug inhibits one or more important growth-enhancing pathways used by glioblastoma. By blocking survival paths, the aim is to render temozolomide, the current standard cytotoxic drug used in primary glioblastoma treatment, more effective. Although esthetically unpleasing to use so many drugs at once, the closely similar drugs of the original CUSP9 used together have been well-tolerated when given on a compassionate-use basis in the cases that have come to our attention so far. We expect similarly good tolerability for CUSP9*.

Patients initiated on enalapril or candesartan treatment in 71 Swedish primary care centers between 1999 and 2007 were included. Medical records data were extracted and linked with nationwide hospital discharge and cause of death registers. The 11,725 patients initiated on enalapril and 4265 on candesartan had similar baseline characteristics. During a mean follow-up of 1.84 years, 36,482 patient-years, the risk of new diabetes onset was lower in the candesartan group (hazard ratio (HR) 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69-0.96, P=0.01) compared with the enalapril group. No difference between the groups was observed in CVD risk (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.87-1.13, P=0.86). More patients discontinued treatment in the enalapril group (38.1%) vs the candesartan group (27.2%).

In this review, we focus on the emerging markers that might be predictive or related to CKD progression physiopathology as well as those related to a different pattern of response to treatment, such as inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers; the vitamin D receptor agonist; salt sensitivity hypertension; and progressive kidney-disease markers with identified genetic polymorphisms). Candidate-gene association studies and genome-wide association studies have analyzed the genetic basis for common renal diseases, including CKD and related factors such as diabetes and hypertension. This review will, in brief, consider genotype-based pharmacotherapy, risk prediction, drug target recognition, and personalized treatments, and will mainly focus on findings in CKD patients. An improved understanding will smooth the progress of switching from classical clinical medicine to gene-based medicine.", 
    "469": "Somatic angiotensin-I converting enzyme (sACE) has an essential role in the regulation of blood pressure and electrolyte fluid homeostasis. It is a zinc protease that cleaves angiotensin-I (AngI), bradykinin, and a broad range of other signalling peptides. The enzyme activity is provided by two homologous domains (N- and C-), which display clear differences in substrate specificities and chloride activation. The presence of chloride ions in sACE and its unusual role in activity was identified early on in the characterisation of the enzyme. The molecular mechanisms of chloride activation have been investigated thoroughly through mutagenesis studies and shown to be substrate-dependent. Recent results from X-ray crystallography structural analysis have provided the basis for the intricate interactions between ACE, its substrate and chloride ions. Here we describe the role of chloride ions in human ACE and its physiological consequences. Insights into the chloride activation of the N- and C-domains could impact the design of improved domain-specific ACE inhibitors.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of different doses of soybean \u03b2-conglycinin, one of the main storage proteins in soy, on diabetic nephropathy in the rat. We used 40 Wistar rats with eight rats in each group. Diabetes mellitus was induced in rats by an intravenous injection of streptozotocin. The groups included a control group (Ctrl) fed with the standard AIN93-M diet, while other groups were fed with AIN-93M with the addition of NaCl to induce diabetic nephropathy (DN). DN rats were divided into the DN control (DN) group, the soy protein (DN + SP) group, the low-dose \u03b2-conglycinin (DN + B) group, and the high-dose \u03b2-conglycinin (DN + 2B) group. After a 27 weeks experimental period, we found that soy protein and \u03b2-conglycinin decreased blood glucose via increasing the insulin sensitivity, with an enhanced cholesterol-lowering effect of \u03b2-conglycinin-mediated hepatic LDL receptor protein expression. Otherwise, there were beneficial effects of soy protein and \u03b2-conglycinin on renal function markers. Through the inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), soy protein and \u03b2-conglycinin retarded the progression of diabetic nephropathy by decreasing the blood pressure and histological changes. In conclusion, soy protein and \u03b2-conglycinin may retard the progression of diabetic nephropathy by increasing insulin sensitivity, regulating lipid metabolism, improving renal function markers, and inhibiting ACE activity.",

Respiratory failure and heart failure undergo simultaneously and affect each other. After dissemination of mechanical ventilation, heart failure is the main cause of death in DMD. Regular assessment of cardiopulmonary function, early introduction of cardioprotective therapy and intensive respiratory care are the key issues in medical managements of DMD. In DMD, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARB) are used as the first line drugs. Beta-blockers (BB) are usually added to ACEI/ARB, when they cannot achieve sufficient effects. Although high dose of BB might be required for functional improvements, even a low dose BB can reduce cardiac events. Recent meta-analyses reported heart rate reduction is more important than BB dose for reducing mortality. Thus heart rate monitoring is essential for titration of BB. Tachycardia under optimal respiratory care can also be an indicator of BB. Although the introduction of BB is relatively safe under gradual dose-escalation from a low dose, hospitalization during uptitration should be considered in advanced cases.",

We compared hereditary and AAE with uncertain aetiopathogenesis: the FXII-HAE and U-HAE groups pooled (FXII/U-HAE) versus InH-AAE. The median age at onset of FXII/U-HAE and InH-AAE was 26 and 38\u00a0years, respectively. In addition, 56% of patients with FXII/U-HAE and 81% of those with InH-AAE reported more than five attacks per year (median duration of 48\u00a0h). The location of angioedema in patients with FXII/U-HAE versus those with InH-AAE was the following: face, 70% versus 86%; tongue, oral cavity or larynx, 55% versus 68%; limbs, 70% versus 56%; and gastrointestinal mucosa, 50% versus 20%. Prophylaxis with tranexamic acid was effective in all six patients with U-HAE and in 37 of 38 with InH-AAE who were started on this treatment.",

The clinical presentation and histopathology of the skin biopsy specimen were consistent with the inflammatory variant of peeling skin syndrome (PSS). She also had a single ventricle with pulmonary stenosis, for which a bidirectional Glenn shunt had been placed. The renal biopsy specimen showed immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy. She responded well to enalapril and steroids, with a decrease in proteinuria. IgA nephropathy has not been previously reported in PSS. Complications such as IgA nephropathy in children with PSS would help to further delineate the diverse clinical presentations and the clinical course of this rare dermatosis.

Third branch mesenteric arteries isolated from lisinopril treated SHR rats (20 mg/kg/day for ten weeks, SHR-T) or untreated (SHR-UT) or normotensive WKY rats were mounted on tension myograph and ACh concentration-response curves were obtained. Westernblotting of eNOS and K(Ca) channels was performed. ACh-induced relaxations were similar in all groups while L-NMMA and indomethacin caused significant rightward shift only in SHR-T group. Apamin and TRAM-34 (SK(Ca) and IK(Ca) channels blockers, respectively) significantly attenuated ACh-induced maximal relaxation by similar magnitude in vessels from all three groups. In the presence of L-NMMA, indomethacin, apamin and TRAM-34 further attenuated ACh-induced relaxation only in SHR-T. Furthermore, lisinopril treatment increased expression of eNOS, SK(Ca) and BK(Ca) proteins. Lisinopril treatment increased expression of eNOS, SK(Ca), BK(Ca) channel proteins and increased the contribution of NO to ACh-mediated relaxation. This increased role of NO was apparent only when EDHF component was blocked by inhibiting SK(Ca) and IK(Ca) channels. Such may suggest that in mesenteric arteries, non-EDHF component functions act as a reserve system to provide compensatory vasodilatation if (and when) hyperpolarization that is mediated by SK(Ca) and IK(Ca) channels is reduced.",

    "506": "Diabetic nephropathy is the most common cause of end-stage renal disease requiring chronic dialysis or renal transplantation, resulting in high morbidity, mortality and societal costs to Canadians. Unfortunately, glycemic targets are often not achieved, and existing medications that block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system only offer partial protection against the development of renal and cardiovascular complications. As a consequence, in type 1 diabetes mellitus, 20% of patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition still have progressive nephropathy over 10 years. More recent work has suggested that blockade of renal sodium-glucose cotransport-2 (SGLT2) improves glycemic control and also reduces blood pressure, suggesting a potential for protective effects. Furthermore, in patients with type 1 diabetes, we have shown that SGLT2 inhibition reduces hyperfiltration, which is a risk factor for diabetic kidney disease and vascular dysfunction. Because primary prevention with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockers have been ineffective in type 1 diabetes, early intervention studies that target alternative pathogenic mechanisms are of the utmost importance. SGLT2 inhibition may represent a safe, novel therapy that simultaneously reduces hyperglycemia, hyperfiltration and blood pressure, leading to renal and cardiovascular protection.",

The AH patients with LF<350 ms2 and S<30% in vertical body's position require \u03b2-blocker treatment. The AH patients with S>25% and LF>250 ms2 in horizontal body's position do not require any ACE-Is or \u03b2-blocker treatment.

    "519": "Complement and the kallikrein-kinin cascade system are both activated in injured tissues. Little is known about their partnership in the immunopathogenesis of Chagas disease, the chronic infection caused by the intracellular protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi. In this study, we show that pharmacological targeting of the C5a receptor (C5aR) or the bradykinin B2 receptor (B2R) inhibited plasma leakage in hamster cheek pouch topically exposed to tissue culture trypomastigotes (TCTs). Further, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors potentiated TCT-evoked paw edema in BALB/c, C57BL/6, and C5-deficient A/J mice through activation of joint pathways between C5aR/B2R or C3aR/B2R. In addition to generation of C5a and kinins via parasite-derived cruzipain, we demonstrate that macrophages internalize TCTs more efficiently through joint activation of C5aR/B2R. Furthermore, we found that C5aR targeting markedly reduces NO production and intracellular parasitism in macrophages. We then studied the impact of C5aR/B2R cross-talk in TCT infection on the development of adaptive immunity. We found that IL-12p40/70 expression was blunted in splenic dendritic cells by blocking either C5aR or B2R, suggesting that codominant signaling via C5aR and B2R fuels production of the Th1-polarizing cytokine. Finally, we assessed the impact of kinins and C5a liberated in parasite-laden tissues on Th cell differentiation. As predicted, BALB/c mice pretreated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors potentiated IFN-\u03b3 production by Ag-specific T cells via C5aR/B2R cross-talk. Interestingly, we found that B2R targeting upregulated IL-10 secretion, whereas C5aR blockade vigorously stimulated IL-4 production. In summary, we describe a novel pathway by which C5aR/B2R cross-talk couples transendothelial leakage of plasma proteins to the cytokine circuitry that coordinates antiparasite immunity.", 
    "520": "Coupled arterial and left ventricular properties are poorly documented in acute heart failure. The aim of this prospective noninvasive study was to document early changes in ventricular-arterial coupling in patients with acutely decompensated HF (ADHF).", 
    "521": "We studied 19 patients hospitalized for ADHF (age 62 \u00b1 15 years, NYHA class 3 or 4). Patients with shock and sustained arrhythmias were excluded. All the patients received intravenous loop diuretics, and none received intravenous vasodilators or inotropes. Ongoing chronic treatments were maintained. Echocardiography and radial artery tonometry were performed simultaneously on admission and after clinical improvement (day 4 \u00b1 1 after admission). Classical echocardiographic parameters were measured, including stroke volume (SV). End-systolic pressure (Pes) was derived from reconstructed central aortic pressure, and arterial elastance (Ea) was calculated as Ea = Pes/SV. End-systolic LV elastance (Ees) was calculated with the single-beat method. Ventricular-arterial coupling was quantified as the Ea/Ees ratio. Following IV diuretic therapy, mean weight loss was 5 \u00b1 2 kg (P < 0\u00b701) and BNP fell from 1813 (median) (IQR = 1284-2342) to 694 (334-1053) pg/mL (P < 0\u00b701).

    "523": "Common adverse effects of angiogenesis inhibition are hypertension and renal injury. To determine the most optimal way to prevent these adverse effects and to explore their interdependency, the following drugs were investigated in unrestrained Wistar Kyoto rats exposed to the angiogenesis inhibitor sunitinib: the dual endothelin receptor antagonist macitentan; the calcium channel blocker amlodipine; the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril; and the phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor sildenafil. Mean arterial pressure was monitored telemetrically. After 8 days, rats were euthanized and blood samples and kidneys were collected. In addition, 24-hour urine samples were collected. After sunitinib start, mean arterial pressure increased rapidly by \u224830 mm Hg. Coadministration of macitentan or amlodipine largely prevented this rise, whereas captopril or sildenafil did not. Macitentan, captopril, and sildenafil diminished the sunitinib-induced proteinuria and endothelinuria and glomerular intraepithelial protein deposition, whereas amlodipine did not. Changes in proteinuria and endothelinuria were unrelated. We conclude that in our experimental model, dual endothelin receptor antagonism and calcium channel blockade are suitable to prevent angiogenesis inhibition-induced hypertension, whereas dual endothelin receptor antagonism, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibition can prevent angiogenesis inhibition-induced proteinuria. Moreover, the variable response of hypertension and renal injury to different antihypertensive agents suggests that these side effects are, at least in part, unrelated.", 
    "524": "Jellyfish (Rhopilema esculentum) was hydrolyzed using alcalase, and two peptides with angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory and antioxidant activities were purified by ultrafiltration and consecutive chromatographic methods. The amino acid sequences of the two peptides were identified as VKP (342 Da) and VKCFR (651 Da) by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. The IC50 values of ACE inhibitory activities of the two peptides were 1.3 \u03bcM and 34.5 \u03bcM, respectively. Molecular docking results suggested that VKP and VKCFR bind to ACE through coordinating with the active site Zn(II) atom. Free radical scavenging activity and protection against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced rat cerebral microvascular endothelial cell (RCMEC) injury were used to evaluate the antioxidant activities of the two peptides. As the results clearly showed that the peptides increased the superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-px) activities in RCMEC cells), it is proposed that the R. esculentum peptides exert significant antioxidant effects.",

The most common lesion associated with HIV is a focal segmental glomeruloscelerosis, but several times, other biopsy findings may also be seen. Our patient had lupus nephritis like pathology picture.

Both antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapy should be adopted for patients with arteriovenous embolism. Balancing the risk of ischemia and hemorrhage is especially challenging in these patients in order to achieve an optimal clinical benefit. We report on a 55-year-old female with acute pulmonary embolism (PE), subsequently diagnosed as having acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and a cerebral infarction. Examinations had been carried out, excluding potential arteriovenous shunts, cancer, antiphospholipid syndrome and other common hypercoagulable states. A combination of an anticoagulant drug (rivaroxaban, an Xa inhibitor) and an antiplatelet agent (clopidogrel, an ADP receptor inhibitor) was prescribed with a \u03b2-blocker and atorvastatin. The embolus was gradually shrunk during the next 10 months, and then it turned back into expanding. During the 16 months' follow-up, an aneurysm of left ventricular apex was found through an echocardiogram and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor was administered. We conclude that combined anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy significantly relieved the symptoms and improved the prognosis in patients suffering from arteriovenous embolism without any major clinical bleeding events.", 
    "529": "With the rising prevalence of cognitive impairment worldwide, clinicians are facing important challenges managing dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease, the most prevalent dementia subtype. Given that current treatments mainly offer symptomatic improvement, without altering disease progression, the challenge now is to identify and integrate new therapeutic strategies. Hypertension is increasingly recognized as a modifiable risk factor for mild cognitive impairment (MCI), the precursor of dementia. The renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) is central to blood pressure regulation and medications targeting RAAS inhibition are associated with reduced rates of both cognitive and functional decline in those with MCI and dementia. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers are widely prescribed anti-hypertensives acting on the RAAS, and there is growing evidence that they act centrally, possibly exerting their effects independent of their blood pressure lowering properties. The relationship is complex however, and given the risks associated with hypotension particularly in older adults, treatment with these agents may not benefit all. Additionally, current evidence is limited to preclinical and observational studies such that there is now a pressing need to confirm preliminary studies with properly conducted randomized control trials. Here, we review some of the salient and complex aspects of these observations to date.",

The primary endpoint was defined as meeting predetermined discharge eligibility criteria within 6 hours of study drug administration. Discharge criteria included improvement of edema, stable vital signs, absence of stridor, absence of dyspnea or use of accessory muscles during respiration, absence of drooling, and ability to drink without difficulty.", 
    "532": "An interim analysis showed that a high percentage of subjects met the primary endpoint, and the study was halted. Overall, 79 subjects were randomized and 76 had data for analysis.

This difference in meeting discharge eligibility endpoint criteria between treatment groups was not statistically significant. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was similar between placebo and active-treatment groups.", 
    "533": "The addition of ecallantide to standard therapy does not appear to improve angioedema compared with placebo in ED patients with ACEIA. Our data suggest that most ED patients presenting with mild to moderate ACEIA are likely to meet our discharge eligibility criteria within 6 hours of treatment, regardless of intervention. Further studies to assess the utility of ecallantide in patients with more severe angioedema may be useful. No new safety signals related to ecallantide administration were identified.", 
    "534": "Currently, peptides and peptidomimetics are the main focus in attempts to identify inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), the dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase that causes blood vessels to constrict and blood pressure to increase. This study was conducted to identify the most potent ACE-inhibitory tripeptides with a proline C-terminus, using a novel three-step (tautomerization-docking-ADME simulation) virtual screening process and in vitro assays. Sixteen candidates were identified, and their IC50 values ranged from 5.6 to 274.4\u03bcM. ACE inhibition activity for 14 of the 16 tripeptides was reported for the first time. We also found that changing from the L-form to the D-form of the amino acid at the amino and carboxyl termini resulted in a decrease of inhibition, but a greater decrease was observed for C-terminal changes. With low IC50 values and high-predicted bioavailability, the peptides identified by our protocol are comparable in terms of ACE-inhibition to those derived from costly and time-consuming wet screening. Our in vitro and docking results showed that the configuration of the C-terminus is a critical parameter contributing to the inhibitory activity of tripeptides with proline at this position. These findings will contribute to the use of simulation tools for rational drug design, especially for ACE inhibitors.",

In this study, we used reishi's own proteases to hydrolyze its protein and obtained auto-digested reishi (ADR) extract. The extract was subjected to in vitro assays and administered to spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHRs) to determine its potential for use as a hypotensive medication. Bioassay-guided fractionation and de novo sequencing were used for identifying the active compounds. After 4 h administration of ADR, the systolic pressure of SHRs significantly decreased to 34.3 mmHg (19.5% change) and the effect was maintained up to 8 h of administration, with the decrease reaching as low as 26.8 mmHg (15% reduction-compare to base line a decrease of 26.8 mmHg is less than a decrease of 34.3 mmHg so it should give a smaller % reduction). Eleven peptides were identified and four of them showed potent inhibition against ACE with IC50 values ranging from 73.1 \u03bcM to 162.7 \u03bcM. The results showed that ADR could be a good source of hypotensive peptides that could be used for antihypertensive medication or incorporation into functional foods.",

Changes of some echocardiographic parameters correlated with severity of subsequent remodeling of the heart, development of chronic heart failure (CHF), myocardial infarction, and recurrent episodes of UA. In UA rate of unfavorable outcomes was related to degree of ischemic myocardial remodeling.

    "546": "Diabetes mellitus is a multifactorial disorder of hyperglycemia caused by a combination of biochemical, molecular and genetic factors, which leads to the dysfunction of various organs including kidneys. Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is one of the microvascular complications of diabetes that results due to poor glycemic control. Several molecular and biochemical pathways have been implicated in the pathogenesis of DN. Of these, the Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone System (RAAS) is considered as a key pathway. RAAS involves various subsystems which contribute to the development of DN. Mutations in several genes of the RAAS pathway have been associated with the development of DN. These genes or their products present them as therapeutic targets for potent drugs to control or prevent DN, and development of new drugs for targeting the RAAS. Drugs in use for DN are mainly the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, Angiotensin Receptors Blockers (ARB) and renin inhibitors which play important roles in reducing DN. Hence, the present review is focused on the pathophysiology and genetic factors for DN by exploring the RAAS pathway and emphasizing the benefits of blocking this pathway to control and prevent DN.",

Formerly, it was the most severe complication in scleroderma and was the most frequent cause of death in these patients. More than 30years ago, with the development of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, SRC became a very treatable complication of scleroderma. Although there are still many patients who do not survive and have poor outcomes, early diagnosis of renal crisis and prompt therapeutic intervention can achieve excellent outcomes. Renal abnormalities independent of renal crisis have been noted, but can usually be attributed to other problems. Further understanding of the pathogenesis of renal disease in scleroderma may lead to additional improvement in the therapy of renal crisis and perhaps the disease in general.

The total amount of ACE-I peptides was in the range 0.87-331mgkg(-1). VPP and IPP largely prevailed in almost all cheeses. Following in vitro static gastrointestinal digestion of Cheddar, Gorgonzola, Maasdam and Grana Padano cheeses, type and amount of ACE-I peptides changed, and only VPP, IPP, HLPLP and LHLPLP were detected in the intestinal digestates. The results evidenced that the degree of proteolysis itself cannot be regarded as a promoting or hindering factor for ACE-I peptide release during cheese digestion. Moreover, the data indicated that the ACE-I potential of cheeses cannot be inferred based on the type and amount of ACE-I peptides present in undigested samples.",

Existing pharmacological studies have previously shown that HTRP could inhibit in vitro thrombosis, delay platelet adhesion, dilate blood vessels, and improve the microcirculation disturbances. In this paper, we chiefly concerned about the potential targets of HTRP and tried to figure out the active components of it. Computer-aided drug design method was emploied to search for the active components and explain the mechanism between the targets and the small molecules at molecular lever. The potential targets of this compound pharmaceutics were searched through relevant pharmacological studies and three pharmacophore models which involved the platelet activating factor (PAF) receptor, the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor (5-HT2A) were constructed by Discotech method of Sybyl. Thus, the candidate compounds which agreed with the pharmacophore models were obtained by the virtual screening to the known ingredients of HTRP. Based on that, sequence and structure prediction of the unknown targets were realized by homology modeling which were used for molecular docking with those candidate compounds. Results showed that three compounds, which may prove to be valid to these targets, got higher scores than the existing corresponding inhibitors after molecular docking, including ferulic acid, onjixanthone I and albiflorin. And the three molecules may refer to the singificant substances to the total compounds of HTRP which were effective to the disease.",

From these single SNP analyses, we derived a summary statistic for the degree of association at the gene and gene complex levels. This was done by grouping SNPs using information on gene locations and defining gene complexes on the basis of protein-protein interactions. To assess the statistical significance of the observed test statistic, we derived an empirical P-value by simulating data under the null hypothesis.",

    "566": "The compound 4-tert-butyl-2,6-bis(thiomorpholin-4-ylmethyl)phenol (TBTIF) has molecular characteristics similar to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors of the sulfhydryl subclass. To assess its value as a new therapeutic agent, we performed a comparative analysis of the effect of TBTIF versus captopril on the circulating levels of angiotensin (Ang) peptides and bradykinin as well as ACE and ACE2 expression after myocardial infarction. Male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: (1) sham-operated rats; (2) rats subjected to 48 h of coronary artery ligation; (3) rats administered captopril (1 mg/kg, i.m.), and (4) a similar group of rats given TBTIF (1 mg/kg, i.m.). Both drugs were administered 30 min before coronary artery ligation and again 24 h later. Acute myocardial infarction lowered both systolic and left ventricular systolic blood pressures compared to the sham group and increased plasma levels of Ang I, Ang II, Ang(1-7) and Ang(1-12). Administration of either captopril or TBTIF reversed the increases in plasma angiotensins. Interestingly, the levels of plasma Ang(1-7) achieved by administration of TBTIF reached values higher than those recorded with captopril. Both agents reversed the decreases in plasma concentrations of bradykinin; in addition, TBTIF upregulated ACE expression, while both agents suppressed the ACE2 upregulation induced by myocardial infarction. These results demonstrate a beneficial effect of the novel compound TBTIF in suppressing the acute surge in the circulating renin-angiotensin system activity induced by myocardial infarction. The greater effects of this compound in augmenting plasma Ang(1-7) concentrations may be highly significant as drugs which augment the concentration of this heptapeptide will exert cardioprotective actions in part by suppressing the hypertrophic and profibrotic actions of Ang II.",

In univariate analysis, old age, female sex, presence of hypertension, presence of diabetes, use of thiazide diuretics, use of angiotensin receptor blocker or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, lung metastasis, and hyponatremia and lower estimated glomerular filtration rate at the start of RAI therapy were significantly associated with hyponatremia in patients undergoing RAI therapy after total thyroidectomy. Multivariate analysis showed that old age, female sex, use of thiazide diuretics, and hyponatremia at the initiation of RAI therapy were independent risk factors for the development of hyponatremia.",

    "571": "The world population is aging and the number of old people is continuously increasing. Arterial structure and function change with age, progressively leading to arterial stiffening. Arterial stiffness is best characterized by measurement of pulse wave velocity (PWV), which is its surrogate marker. It has been shown that PWV could improve cardiovascular event prediction in models that included standard risk factors. Consequently, it might therefore enable better identification of populations at high-risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The present review is focused on a survey of different pharmacological therapeutic options for decreasing arterial stiffness. The influence of several groups of drugs is described: antihypertensive drugs (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, diuretics, and nitrates), statins, peroral antidiabetics, advanced glycation end-products (AGE) cross-link breakers, anti-inflammatory drugs, endothelin-A receptor antagonists, and vasopeptidase inhibitors. All of these have shown some effect in decreasing arterial stiffness. Nevertheless, further studies are needed which should address the influence of arterial stiffness diminishment on major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE).",

Most data suggest that current therapy, especially renin-angiotensin system inhibition alone, is not sufficient to initiate and maintain long-term regression of glomerular structural injury. In this article, we review the potential reversal of glomerulosclerosis and evidence from both human and animal studies. We discuss mechanisms that involve matrix remodeling, capillary reorganization, and podocyte reconstitution. In the future, a multipronged strategy including novel anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic molecules should be considered to potentiate regression of glomerulosclerosis.",

Clinically, adults with FSGS present with proteinuria that may be accompanied by the nephrotic syndrome. Once identifiable (secondary) causes are excluded, the diagnosis of idiopathic FSGS, a challenging glomerular disease to understand and manage, is made. On the basis of mostly retrospective data, first-line treatment for idiopathic FSGS patients with nephrotic-range proteinuria is a prolonged course of corticosteroids. However, steroid resistance is common and portends an increased risk of long-term decline in kidney function and end-stage kidney disease in these patients compared with responders. Multiple other immunosuppression regimens have been used in steroid-resistant FSGS, some of which have been studied in randomized controlled trials. Here, we review the data on the treatment for idiopathic FSGS in adults.",

Among them, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) with calcium channel blockers (CCBs) or diuretics are the representative recommended combination since each drug has evidence of reducing cardiovascular events. Recent studies using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring have also suggested that the fixed-dose ARB-based combination therapies with either CCBs or diuretics are well tolerated and effectively lower the BP throughout a 24-hour interval by their long-acting half-lives, nighttime BP lowering effect and improving adherence. It will become more important to use these fixed-dose antihypertensive drugs adequately for controlling the 24-hour blood pressure.", 
    "575": "Sarcopenia, the loss of muscle mass and function with age, is highly relevant to clinical practice as it has been associated with a wide range of ageing outcomes including disability and shorter survival times. As such it is now a major focus for research and drug discovery. There has been recent progress in the development of consensus definitions for the diagnosis of sarcopenia, taking the form of measurements of muscle mass and strength or physical performance. These definitions form potential inclusion criteria for use in trials, although the optimum choice of outcome measures is less clear. Prevalence estimates using these new definitions vary, although they suggest that sarcopenia is a common (approximately 13% from one study) clinical problem in older people. A range of lifestyle factors have been investigated in regard to the development of this condition, and progressive resistance training is the most well-established intervention so far. There is also marked research interest in the role of diet, although so far the value of supplementation is less clear. Other potential treatments for sarcopenia include the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, with some evidence that they can improve physical performance in older people. Future research directions include an increased understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms of sarcopenia and the use of a life course approach to explore the possibility of earlier intervention and prevention.", 
    "576": "Dimerization of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is crucial for receptor function including agonist affinity, efficacy, trafficking and specificity of signal transduction, including G protein coupling. Emerging data suggest that the cardiovascular system is the main target of apelin, which exerts an overall neuroprotective role, and is a positive regulator of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in heart failure. Moreover, ACE2 cleaves off C-terminal residues of vasoactive peptides including apelin-13, and neurotensin that activate the apelin receptor (APJ) and neurotensin receptor 1 (NTSR1) respectively, that belong to the A class of GPCRs. Therefore, based on the similar mode of modification by ACE2 at peptide level, the homology at amino acid level and the capability of forming dimers with other GPCRs, we have been suggested that APJ and NTSR1 can form a functional heterodimer. Using co-immunoprecipitation, BRET and FRET, we provided conclusive evidence of heterodimerization between APJ and NTSR1 in a constitutive and induced form. Upon agonist stimulation, hetrodimerization enhanced ERK(1/2) activation and increased proliferation via activation of Gq \u03b1-subunits. These novel data provide evidence for a physiological role of APJ/NTSR1 heterodimers in terms of ERK(1/2) activation and increased intracellular calcium and induced cell proliferation and provide potential new pharmaceutical targets for cardiovascular disease.", 
    "577": "Primary aldosteronism (PA) is common in young or middle-aged hypertensive patients, but PA among the elderly has recently become more common. As salt sensitivity increases with age, plasma renin activity (PRA) tends to decrease, whereas the aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR) tends to increase in the elderly. The aim of this study was to clarify the influence of aging on the diagnosis of PA. We retrospectively evaluated 155 consecutively admitted patients who were not taking antihypertensive medications or calcium channel blockers and \u03b1 blockers that underwent PRA and plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) measurements. The study subjects included 13 PA and 69 essential hypertensive (EHT) patients aged over 65 years, and 32 PA and 41 EHT patients under aged 65 years. Our study clarified the influence of aging through screening and confirmatory tests for the diagnosis of PA. Our results showed the ARR cutoff value for a screening test to be 556 (area under the curve: AUC=0.906), its sensitivity and specificity to be 84.6% and 89.9%, respectively, and the likelihood ratio to be 8.34 in the elderly, whereas the ARR cutoff value was 272 in the non-elderly. In the saline infusion test, the mean PAC was 86.6 \u00b1 41.8 pg ml(-1) in the elderly and 158.1 \u00b1 116.5 pg ml(-1) in the non-elderly (P = 0.04). There was no influence from age in both the captopril challenge test and the furosemide upright test. Aging may influence PA screening and saline infusion tests; thus, we should consider the influence of aging in the diagnosis of elderly subjects with PA.", 
    "578": "In recent years, treatment strategies for hypertension have often focused on combination therapies that include diuretics and renin angiotensin aldosterone system blockers such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. However, in clinical practice, a significant number of patients do not respond completely to these combination treatments, and long-term reduction of cardiovascular risk remains insufficient. The particularly high residual cardiovascular risk of hypertensive patients, even when adequately treated with strategies based on renin angiotensin aldosterone system blockers, speaks in favor of new, innovative strategies. Thus, it has become relevant to consider whether it is always necessary to block plasma renin activation and whether other guideline-approved combinations should be considered routinely. Diuretic/calcium channel blocker combinations, which are supported by significant long-term evidence, are put forth as a preferred combination in the main guidelines, but are still underused by physicians who do not yet have easy access to such treatments. Fixed-dose indapamide sustained release/amlodipine is the first such single-pill combination to become available. Complementary mechanisms of action of these two molecules are expected to lead to greater and longer-term reductions in systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure and potentially to the reduction of cardiovascular risk.",

This approach represents systematic methodologies that integrate structure-activity and structure-metabolism relationships and are aimed to design safe, locally active compounds with an improved therapeutic index. It embraces two distinct methods, chemical delivery systems and a soft drug approach. Present review recapitulates an impression of RMDD giving reflections on the chemical delivery system and the soft drug approach and provides a variety of examples to embody its concepts. Successful application of such design principles has already been applied to a number of marketed drugs like esmolol; loteprednol etc., and many other candidates like beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, alkylating agents, antimicrobials etc., are also under investigation.",

    "584": "Proteinuria is a relatively frequent complication in children after renal transplantation (40-80 %). It is usually mild and non-nephrotic in nature and predominantly tubular in origin. The major causes of post-transplant proteinuria are recurrence of primary glomerulonephritis [mostly focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS)], rejection (acute and chronic), mTOR inhibitors or hypertension. Proteinuria is a risk factor for graft loss and patient death in adults, and even a mild proteinuria (0.1-0.2 g/day) is associated with impaired graft and patient survival. In children, proteinuria seems to be associated with graft but not patient survival. Proteinuria (protein/creatinine ratio) should be assessed regularly in all children. In children with prior chronic kidney disease due to idiopathic FSGS, proteinuria should be assessed daily during the first month after transplantation to enable early diagnosis of recurrence. The cause of proteinuria should be identified, and graft biopsy should be considered in children with unexplained proteinuria, especially with new onset proteinuria or deterioration of previously mild proteinuria. Treatment must be primarily targeted at the cause of proteinuria, and in normotensive children symptomatic antiproteinuric therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor antagonists should also be initiated. Other antihypertensive drugs should be used to achieve target blood pressure of\u2009<75th percentile. Target proteinuria should be\u2009<20 mg/mmol creatinine.", 
    "585": "The aim of this study was to investigate the renal protective effect of icariin in 5/6 nephrectomized rats and the molecular mechanisms involved. Forty male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 5 groups: sham-operated group, 5/6 nephrectomy model group, icariin groups (20 and 40 mg/kg), and benazepril group. After 12-weeks treatment, 24-h urine and serum were collected, and urine protein, serum creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen were determined. The rats were then sacrificed and fresh kidney tissues were prepared to obtain single cell suspensions. Cell cycle distribution and cell apoptosis were determined by annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide (PI) double staining using a flow cytometer. mRNA expression of Bcl-2 and Bax was examined using quantitative real-time PCR. After 12-weeks treatment, urinary protein, serum creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen in the icariin-treated group were much lower than in the untreated group compared with 5/6 nephrectomy model. Icariin reduced the percentage of S phase cells, increased the percentage of G0/M phase cells, and inhibited apoptosis in the renal cells. mRNA expression of Bcl-2 and Bax was decreased. In conclusion, icariin has a renal protective effect in 5/6 nephrectomized rats, which may be related mainly to alterations in cell cycle distribution and expression of apoptotic genes.",

Our objective is to explore sources of this heterogeneity by applying a common protocol in different data settings. We conducted ten case-control studies using data from five different health care databases. Databases varied on type of patients (hospitalised vs. GP), level of case validity, and mode of exposure ascertainment (prescription or dispensing based). Identified CAP patients and controls were matched on age, gender, and calendar year. Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (OR) for the associations between the drugs of interest and CAP. Associations were adjusted by a common set of potential confounders. Data of 38,742 cases and 118,019 controls were studied. Comparable patterns of variation between case-control studies were observed for ACEi, statins and PPI use and pneumonia risk with adjusted ORs varying from 1.04 to 1.49, 0.82 to 1.50 and 1.16 to 2.71, respectively. Overall, higher ORs were found for hospitalised CAP patients matched to population controls versus GP CAP patients matched to population controls. Prevalence of drug exposure was higher in dispensing data versus prescription data. We show that case-control selection and methods of exposure ascertainment induce bias that cannot be adjusted for and to a considerable extent explain the heterogeneity in results obtained in case-control studies on statins, ACEi and PPIs and CAP. The common protocol approach helps to better understand sources of variation in observational studies.",

The traditional ACE inhibitory peptides screening method is both time consuming and money costing, to the contrary, virtual screening method by computation can break these limitations. We establish a virtual screening method to obtain ACE inhibitory peptides with the help of Libdock module of Discovery Studio 3.5 software. A significant relationship between Libdock score and experimental IC(50) was found, Libdock score = 10.063 log(1/IC(50)) + 68.08 (R(2) = 0.62). The credibility of the relationship was confirmed by testing the coincidence of the estimated log(1/IC(50)) and measured log(1/IC(50)) (IC(50) is 50% inhibitory concentration toward ACE, in \u03bcmol/L) of 5 synthetic ACE inhibitory peptides, which was virtual hydrolyzed and screened from a kind of seafood, Phascolosoma esculenta. Accordingly, Libdock method is a valid IC(50) estimation tool and virtual screening method for small ACE inhibitory peptides.",

The inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is an effective target to manage essential hypertension. In this study, the fermentation properties (titratable acidity, free amino nitrogen, and fermentation time) and ACE-inhibitory (ACEI) activity of fermented milks produced by 259 Lactobacillus helveticus strains previously isolated from traditional Chinese and Mongolian fermented foods were determined. Among them, 37 strains had an ACEI activity of over 50%. The concentrations of the antihypertensive peptides, Ile-Pro-Pro and Val-Pro-Pro, were further determined by ultra performance liquid chromatography with quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The change of ACEI activity of the fermented milks of 3 strains exhibiting the highest ACEI activity upon gastrointestinal protease treatment was assayed. Fermented milks produced by strain H9 (IMAU60208) had the highest in vitro ACEI activity (86.4 \u00b1 1.5%), relatively short fermentation time (7.5 h), and detectable Val-Pro-Pro (2.409 \u00b1 0.229 \u00b5M) and Ile-Pro-Pro (1.612 \u00b1 0.114 \u00b5M) concentrations.

However, individual patient responses to these pharmacotherapies vary widely. The variability in response cannot be explained entirely by clinical characteristics, and genetic variation may play a role. The purpose of this chapter is to examine the current knowledge in the field of beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor pharmacogenetics in HF. \u03b2-blocker and ACE inhibitor pharmacogenetic studies performed in patients with HF were identified from the PubMed database from 1966 to July 2011. Thirty beta-blocker and 10 ACE inhibitor pharmacogenetic studies in patients with HF were identified.The ACE deletion variant was associated with greater survival benefit from ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers compared with the ACE insertion. Ser49 in the \u03b21AR, the insertion in the \u03b12CAR, and Gln41 in G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) kinase (GRK)-5 are associated with greater survival benefit from \u03b2-blockers, compared with Gly49, the deletion, and Leu41, respectively. However, many of these associations have not been validated. The HF pharmacogenetic literature is still in its very early stages, but there are promising candidate genetic variants that may identify which HF patients are most likely to benefit from beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors and patients that may require additional therapies.", 
    "597": "Using embryonic chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus), we examined the role of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in cardiovascular and osmotic homeostasis through chronic captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Captopril (5 mg kg\u207b\u00b9 embryo wet mass) or saline (control) was delivered via the egg air cell daily from embryonic day 5-18. Mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (\u0192(H)), fluid osmolality and ion concentration, and embryonic and organ masses were measured on day 19. Exogenous angiotensin I (ANG I) injection did not change MAP or \u0192(H) in captopril-treated embryos, confirming ACE inhibition. Captopril-treated embryos were significantly hypotensive, with MAP 15% lower than controls, which we attributed to the loss of vasoconstrictive ANG II action. Exogenous ANG II induced a relatively greater hypertensive response in captopril-treated embryos compared to controls. Changes in response to ANG II following pre-treatment with phentolamine (\u03b1-adrenergic antagonist) indicated a portion of the ANG II response was due to circulating catecholamines in captopril-treated embryos. An increase in MAP and \u0192(H) in response to hexamethonium indicated vagal tone was also increased in the absence of ACE activity. Captopril-treated embryos had lower osmolality, lower Na\u207a and higher K\u207a concentration in the blood, indicating osmoregulatory changes. Larger kidney mass in captopril-treated embryos suggests disrupting the RAS may stimulate kidney growth by decreasing resistance at the efferent arteriole and increasing the fraction of cardiac output to the kidneys. This study suggests that the RAS, most likely through ANG II action, influences the development of the cardiovascular and osmoregulatory systems.",

Of the included studies, five reported data on total mortality, three reported data on total cardiovascular events, and four reported data on cardiovascular mortality. No study separately reported cardiovascular morbidity. In contrast, eight studies contributed data on WDAE. Included studies were of good to moderate quality. There was no evidence of a difference between ACE inhibitors and ARBs for total mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.98; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88 to 1.10), total cardiovascular events (RR 1.07; 95% CI 0.96 to 1.19), or cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.98; 95% CI 0.85 to 1.13).

The quality of the evidence for mortality and cardiovascular outcomes was limited by possible publication bias, in that several studies were initially eligible for inclusion in this review, but had no extractable data available for the hypertension subgroup. To this end, the evidence for total mortality was judged to be moderate, while the evidence for total cardiovascular events was judged to be low by the GRADE approach.",

Although ACE inhibitors have shown efficacy in these outcomes over placebo, our results cannot be used to extrapolate the same conclusion for ARBs directly, which have not been studied in placebo-controlled trials for hypertension. Thus, the substitution of an ARB for an ACE inhibitor, while supported by evidence on grounds of tolerability, must be made in consideration of the weaker evidence for the efficacy of ARBs regarding mortality and morbidity outcomes compared with ACE inhibitors. Additionally, our data mostly derives from participants with existing clinical sequelae of hypertension, and it would be useful to have data from asymptomatic people to increase the generalizability of this review. Unpublished subgroup data of hypertensive participants in existing trials comparing ACE inhibitors and ARBs needs to be made available for this purpose.",

In this study, the effect of ACE inhibitors and AT1 receptor antagonists on tubular cell apoptosis and interstitial fibrosis in obstructive nephropathy after UUO in rats was investigated. The study was conducted on Wistar rats with unilaterally ligated ureter and sham operated animals (control group). The rats with UUO were treated with ACE inhibitor (cilazapril) or AT1 receptor antagonists (losartan) and control group was treated with H2O. Sham-operated animals were treated in the same way. Tubular and interstitial cell apoptosis was detected morphologically by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end-labeling (TUNEL). The area of intersitial fibrosis was determined using computer-assisted image processing after Gomory silver impregnation of paraffin sections. All experimental animal groups with unilateral ureter ligation showed a significantly increased number of apoptotic tubular and interstitial cells in the obstructed kidney compared with the contralateral, unobstructed kidney. Histomorphometric analysis of renal interstitial fibrotic changes in the groups of rats treated with losartan or water showed a statistically significant difference (p < 0.05) between the operated and sham--operated animals. In conclusion, following UUO there is a significantly increased number of apoptotic tubular cells and interstitial fibrosis in the ipsilateral kidney compared with the contralateral kidney.

The angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) benazepril has been shown to slow the progression of chronic renal disease and have beneficial effects in patients with a combination of chronic renal disease and cardiovascular disease. Transforming growth factor-\u03b2(1) (TGF-\u03b2(1)) plays a central role in the pathogenesis and progression of DN. Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) can modulate TGF-\u03b2(1)-induced glomerular mesangial cell (GMC) injury, which is a prominent characteristic of renal pathology in kidney diseases. As an integrin cytoplasmic-binding protein, ILK regulates fibronectin (FN) matrix deposition and the actin cytoskeleton.

Ang II increased ERK and Akt phosphorylation in the HG group, and benazepril could not completely block these responses, suggesting that other molecules might be involved in the progression of DN.

The oyster hydrolysate with the lowest 50% ACE inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.40 mg/mL was obtained by two-step hydrolysis of the cross-linked oyster protein using Protamex and Neutrase. Five ACE inhibitory peptides were purified from the oyster hydrolysate using a multistep chromatographic procedure comprised of ion-exchange, size exclusion, and reversed-phase liquid chromatography. Their sequences were identified as TAY, VK, KY, FYN, and YA, using automated Edman degradation and mass spectrometry. These peptides were synthesized, and their IC50 values were measured to be 16.7, 29.0, 51.5, 68.2, and 93.9 \u03bcM, respectively. Toxicity of the peptides on the HepG2 cell line was not detected. The oyster hydrolysate also significantly decreased the systolic blood pressure of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR).

    "631": "Despite current practice, patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at increased risk of progression to end-stage renal disease and cardiovascular events. Neprilysin inhibition (NEPi) is a new therapeutic strategy with potential to improve outcomes for patients with CKD. NEPi enhances the activity of natriuretic peptide systems leading to natriuresis, diuresis and inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which could act as a potentially beneficial counter-regulatory system in states of RAS activation such as chronic heart failure (HF) and CKD. Early NEPi drugs were combined with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors but were associated with unacceptable rates of angioedema and, therefore, withdrawn. However, one such agent (omapatrilat) showed promise of NEP/RAS inhibition in treating CKD in animal models, producing greater reductions in proteinuria, glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis compared with isolated RAS inhibition. A new class of drug called angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor (ARNi) has been developed. One such drug, LCZ696, has shown substantial benefits in trials in hypertension and HF. In CKD, HF is common due to a range of mechanisms including hypertension and structural heart disease (including left ventricular hypertrophy), suggesting that ARNi could benefit patients with CKD by both retarding the progression of CKD (hence delaying the need for renal replacement therapy) and reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease.

We review the pathophysiology of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis in Addison's disease and how this is altered in the setting of hypertension and heart failure. An essential first step in management in both conditions is optimizing glucocorticoid replacement and considering dose reduction if excessive. Following this, if a patient with Addison's disease remains hypertensive, the fludrocortisone dose should be reviewed and reduced if there are clinical and/or biochemical signs of mineralocorticoid excess. In the absence of such signs, where the renin is towards the upper end of the normal range or elevated, an angiotensin II (AII) receptor antagonist or angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor is the treatment of choice, and the fludrocortisone dose should remain unchanged. Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are clinically useful as second line agents, but diuretics should be avoided. In the setting of heart failure, there is an increase in total body sodium and water; therefore, it is appropriate to reduce and rarely consider ceasing the fludrocortisone. Loop diuretics may be used, but not aldosterone antagonists such as spironolactone or eplerenone. Standard treatment with ACE inhibitors, or as an alternative, AII receptor antagonists, are appropriate.

A pre-experiment conducted to verify the effectiveness and toxicity of enalapril (0.5\u00a0mg/kg LW) and valsartan (2.2\u00a0mg/kg LW) showed that, in the doses used, these drugs were effective in reducing blood pressure without producing toxic effects. In the experiment, all animals were subjected to oestrous synchronization protocol during 12\u00a0days. On D10, D11 and D12, animals received saline, enalapril or valsartan (same doses of the pre-experiment), according to the group randomly divided.

It is concluded that valsartan and enalapril are safe and effective subcutaneously for use in sheep and that the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition with enalapril leads to an increase in oestradiol production near ovulation without changing the concentration of progesterone. This shows that ACE inhibition may be a useful tool in reproductive biotechnologies involving induction and synchronization of oestrus and ovulation in sheep.",

In addition, all individuals are generally believed to be salt sensitive and, thus, severe restriction of salt intake is recommended to all. Nevertheless, the physiological defense mechanisms in the kidney against excess salt intake have not been well clarified. The present review article demonstrated that the renal (tissue) kallikrein-kinin system (KKS) is ideally situated within the nephrons of the kidney, where it functions to inhibit the reabsorption of NaCl through the activation of bradykinin (BK)-B2 receptors localized along the epithelial cells of the collecting ducts (CD). Kinins generated in the CD are immediately inactivated by two kidney-specific kinin-inactivating enzymes (kininases), carboxypeptidase Y-like exopeptidase (CPY), and neutral endopeptidase (NEP). Our work demonstrated that ebelactone B and poststatin are selective inhibitors of these kininases. The reduced secretion of the urinary kallikrein is linked to the development of salt-sensitive hypertension, whereas potassium ions and ATP-sensitive potassium channel blockers ameliorate salt-sensitive hypertension by accelerating the release of renal kallikrein. On the other hand, ebelactone B and poststatin prolong the life of kinins in the CD after excess salt intake, thereby leading to the augmentation of natriuresis and diuresis, and the ensuing suppression of salt-sensitive hypertension. In conclusion, accelerators of the renal kallikrein release and selective renal kininase inhibitors are both novel types of antihypertensive agents that may be useful for treatment of salt-sensitive hypertension.",

Despite the large number of HF patients with frequent hospitalizations for decompensation, only a few studies have evaluated the management of oral chronic therapies in the clinical setting of ADHF.

Since aldosterone plays a key role in vascular injury, the aim of this study was to determine whether mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) blockade improves CFR in individuals with T2DM. Sixty-four men and women with well-controlled diabetes on chronic ACE inhibition (enalapril 20 mg/day) were randomized to add-on therapy of spironolactone 25 mg, hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 12.5 mg, or placebo for 6 months. CFR was assessed by cardiac positron emission tomography at baseline and at the end of treatment. There were significant and similar decreases in systolic blood pressure with spironolactone and HCTZ but not with placebo. CFR improved with treatment in the spironolactone group as compared with the HCTZ group and with the combined HCTZ and placebo groups. The increase in CFR with spironolactone remained significant after controlling for baseline CFR, change in BMI, race, and statin use. Treatment with spironolactone improved coronary microvascular function, raising the possibility that MR blockade could have beneficial effects in preventing cardiovascular disease in patients with T2DM.", 
    "673": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) have immunomodulating properties and have been suggested to protect against endothelial injury, for example myocardial infarction and reperfusion injury. We tested whether two ACEi (captopril and enalapril), differing in a thiol group, protected human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) from cytotoxicity induced by polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) in vitro, when cells were activated by tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) or the arachidonate derivative lipoxin-A4 (LXA4 ), using separate cytotoxicity pathways. When (51) Cr labelled HUVEC were treated with captopril (0-500\u00a0\u03bcm) or enalapril (0-100\u00a0\u03bcm) for 2\u00a0h and then activated by TNF\u03b1 (100\u00a0ng/ml) for 24\u00a0h, a significant, dose-dependent reduction of (51) Cr release was observed. Similarly, captopril reduced (51) Cr release when LXA4 (0.1\u00a0\u03bcm) was used to stimulate PMN for 4\u00a0h. Among previously defined mechanisms of significance for the cytotoxic reaction, expression of ICAM-1, but not intracellular Ca(2+) changes in PMN or PMN adherence to HUVEC, were reduced by ACEi treatment. Moreover, both ACEi inhibited HUVEC surface expression of TNF\u03b1 receptor I (but not II). Thus, these ACEi, particularly captopril, interfere with PMN-induced cytotoxicity for endothelial cells by modulating pro-inflammatory surface receptors, which is a novel effect that might be explored for further therapeutic approaches.",

Angioedema is a known, but rare, adverse effect of ACEIs and ARBs. Therefore, it is important for clinicians to have a thorough understanding of risks and benefits of prescribing these medications, particularly in patients with a history of angioedema.

Secondly, to evaluate the ACE inhibitory activity of generated hydrolysates. A two-step ex vivo and in vitro model digestion was performed to simulate the human digestion process. Salmon proteins were degraded more efficiently by porcine enzymes than by human gastrointestinal juices and sarcoplasmic proteins were digested/hydrolyzed more easily than myofibrillar proteins. The ex vivo digested myofibrillar and sarcoplasmic duodenal samples showed IC50 values (concentration required to decrease the ACE activity by 50%) of 1.06 and 2.16 mg/mL, respectively. The in vitro hydrolyzed myofibrillar and sarcoplasmic samples showed IC50 values of 0.91 and 1.04 mg/mL, respectively. Based on the results of in silico studies, it was possible to identify 9 peptides of the ex vivo hydrolysates and 7 peptides of the in vitro hydrolysates of salmon proteins of 11 selected peptides. In both types of salmon hydrolysates, ACE-inhibitory peptides IW, IY, TVY and VW were identified. In the in vitro salmon protein hydrolysates an ACE-inhibitory peptides VPW and VY were also detected, while ACE-inhibitory peptides ALPHA, IVY and IWHHT were identified in the hydrolysates generated with ex vivo digestion. In our studies, we documented ACE inhibitory in vitro effects of salmon protein hydrolysates obtained by human and as well as porcine gastrointestinal enzymes.",

The improvement of QSYQ was accompanied with a restoration of angiotensin II-NADPHoxidase-ROS-MMPs pathways. In addition, \"therapeutic\" QSYQ administration can reduce both TNF-\u03b1-NF-B and IL-6-STAT3 pathways, respectively, which further proves the beneficial effects of QSYQ.",

The effects of ASS and enalapril were assessed in vitro and in a transgenic mouse model of pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (pNENs). The effects of enalapril and ASS on proliferation and expression of the AGTR1A and its target gene vascular endothelial growth factor (Vegfa) were assessed in the neuroendocrine cell line BON1. Rip1-Tag2 mice were treated daily with either 0.6\u200amg/kg bodyweight of enalapril i.p., 20\u200amg/kg bodyweight of ASS i.p., or a vehicle in a prevention (weeks 5-12) and a survival group (week 5 till death). Tumor surface, weight of pancreatic glands, immunostaining for AT1-R and nuclear factor kappa beta (NFKB), and mice survival were analyzed. In addition, sections from human specimens of 20 insulinomas, ten gastrinomas, and 12 non-functional pNENs were evaluated for AT1-R and NFKB (NFKB1) expression and grouped according to the current WHO classification. Proliferation was significantly inhibited by enalapril and ASS in BON1 cells, with the combination being the most effective. Treatment with enalapril and ASS led to significant downregulation of known target genes Vegf and Rela at RNA level. Tumor growth was significantly inhibited by enalapril and ASS in the prevention group displayed by a reduction of tumor size (84%/67%) and number (30%/45%). Furthermore, daily treatment with enalapril and ASS prolonged the overall median survival compared with vehicle-treated Rip1-Tag2 (107 days) mice by 9 and 17 days (P=0.016 and P=0.013). The AT1-R and the inflammatory transcription factor NFKB were abolished completely upon enalapril and ASS treatment. AT1-R and NFKB expressions were observed in 80% of human pNENs. Enalapril and ASS may provide an approach for chemoprevention and treatment of pNENs.",

We identified 42 studies that provided relevant information on acute hospital care (25 LMICs; 232,550 patients) and 11 studies on the management of chronic heart failure in primary care or outpatient settings (14 LMICs; 5,358 patients). The mean age of patients studied ranged from 42 y in Cameroon and Ghana to 75 y in Argentina, and mean age in studies largely correlated with the human development index of the country in which they were conducted (r = 0.71, p<0.001). Overall, ischaemic heart disease was the main reported cause of heart failure in all regions except Africa and the Americas, where hypertension was predominant. Taking both those managed acutely in hospital and those in non-acute outpatient or community settings together, 57% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 49%-64%) of patients were treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, 34% (95% CI: 28%-41%) with beta-blockers, and 32% (95% CI: 25%-39%) with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. Mean inpatient stay was 10 d, ranging from 3 d in India to 23 d in China. Acute heart failure accounted for 2.2% (range: 0.3%-7.7%) of total hospital admissions, and mean in-hospital mortality was 8% (95% CI: 6%-10%).

    "692": "Several recent clinical trials show that blocking agents of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) reduce cardiovascular events in patients with metabolic syndrome based on insulin resistance and obesity, especially accumulated visceral fat. Our laboratory has focused on the relationship between the vascular RAAS and the action of insulin on the vasculature. We first revealed that the addition of insulin to cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) markedly increases angiotensinogen and angiotensin II (Ang II) expression and production. Insulin addition also induces VSMC growth that is inhibited by the blockade of the RAAS by either ACEI or ARB which suggests a role for the RAAS in insulin-mediated growth. Insulin has a quite different effect on cultured vascular endothelial cells (EC) as it reduces angiotensinogen and renin expression. However, insulin added to EC induces a marked activation of ACE and the activated ACE promotes the conversion of Ang I to Ang II and cell growth under conditions of high insulin concentration. Ang II induces the progression of atherosclerosis through the production of oxidative stress that blocks insulin signaling and accelerates atherosclerosis. In this paper, we attempt to clarify the relationship between insulin resistance, the RAAS, and oxidative stress in vascular tissues to mimic in vivo conditions found in patients with metabolic syndrome and obesity-related hypertension as previously I reviewed in \"Current Hypertension Reviews\" in 2010 [1]. In addition, I update the relationships between vascular RAAS and insulin resistance for the last 4 years. JSH-2014 [2] states that the target goals of blood pressure (BP) for diabetes patients is lower than 130/80 mmHg, whereas updated JNC 8 [3] and ESH-ESC 2013 [4] recommends the target BP was changed to <140/90 mmHg for hypertensive patients with diabetes. Patients with diabetes and hypertension have reduced mortality as well as improved cardiovascular and cerebrovascular outcomes with treatment to a goal SBP <150 mm Hg, but no randomized controlled trials support a goal <140/90 mm Hg. Despite this, the panel opted for a conservative recommendation in patients with diabetes and hypertension, opting for a goal level of <140/90 mm Hg in adult patients with diabetes and hypertension rather than the evidence based goal of <150/90 mm Hg [3, 5]. JSH-2014 recommends that the first choice of antihypertensive medication should be RAAS blockers such as ACE inhibitor or ARB. For the last several years, several large cohort clinical studies using ACEI and ARB have shown more favorable effects, but aldosterone receptor inhibitor (mineral corticoid receptor inhibitors; MR inhibitors) and Renin Inhibitors have been withdrawn. Some studies showed the strong support to use these medications for diabetic patients. This review will discuss the relationships between vascular RAAS and insulin resistance in patients with hypertension and diabetes as previously reviewed with new updated findings for the last 4 years, and clinical implications based on updated JNC-8, ESH-ESC2013 and JSH-2014.", 
    "693": "The presence of a tissue-based renin-angiotensin system, independent of the systemic one, has been identified in several organs including the brain. Experimental models have suggested the involvement of the renin-angiotensin system in neurogenic inflammation, susceptibility to oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, and neuromodulation of nociceptive transmission, thus potentially contributing to the pathogenesis of migraine. Genetic factors that increase susceptibility to migraine may include angiotensin-converting enzyme polymorphism, although available data are controversial. Clinical studies have suggested that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers may be effective in migraine prophylaxis. However, further research should clarify whether the postulated preventive effect is attributable to a pharmacological action over and above the antihypertensive effect and should test their tolerability in subjects with normal blood pressure values. In patients with contraindications or not responding to conventional prophylactic drugs and in patients with comorbid arterial hypertension, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers may be used for migraine prophylaxis.",

A heightened awareness among health care providers can result in early diagnosis of heart failure in late pregnancy and the early postpartum period. Though the symptoms of dyspnea and fatigue can result from normal physiologic changes during pregnancy, an electrocardiogram and brain natriuretic peptide level should be obtained in these patients, in addition to baseline laboratory tests such as a complete blood count, and basic metabolic and hepatic function panels. If the electrocardiogram and brain natriuretic peptide level are abnormal, an echocardiogram should be obtained. The role of endomyocardial biopsy for the diagnosis of PPCM is controversial. Patients should be started on diuretics if volume overloaded, and beta-blockers (preferably metoprolol) if no contraindications exist; angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers should be avoided during pregnancy or lactation. There are no standard, universally accepted guidelines for the management of PPCM. Although experimental therapies like bromocriptine, pentoxifylline and immunoglobulins have shown promising results, large double-blind randomized trials are essential to confirm the results of smaller studies. In patients with persistent severe left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, advanced therapies like mechanical circulatory support and heart transplantation should be considered.

This study investigated whether hypertension induced by continuous light (24 hours/day) exposure induces heart and aorta remodelling and if these alterations are prevented by melatonin or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril. Four groups of 3-month-old male Wistar rats (10 per group) were treated as follows for six weeks: untreated controls, exposed to continuous light, light-exposed, and treated with either captopril (100\u2009mg/kg/day) or melatonin (10\u2009mg/kg/day). Exposure to continuous light led to hypertension, left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy and fibrosis, and enhancement of the oxidative load in the LV and aorta. Increase in systolic blood pressure by continuous light exposure was prevented completely by captopril and partially by melatonin. Both captopril and melatonin reduced the wall thickness and cross-sectional area of the aorta and reduced the level of oxidative stress. However, only captopril reduced LV hypertrophy development and only melatonin reduced LV hydroxyproline concentration in insoluble and total collagen in rats exposed to continuous light. In conclusion, captopril prevented LV hypertrophy development in the continuous light-induced hypertension model, while only melatonin significantly reduced fibrosis. This antifibrotic action of melatonin may be protective in hypertensive heart disease.",

Over the past decade we have come to realise that permselectivity depends on size and not necessarily charge, that the molecular sieve depends on the podocyte contractile apparatus and is highly dynamic, and that protein uptake by proximal tubular epithelial cells stimulates signalling and the production of transcription factors and inflammatory mediators. Alport syndrome is the second commonest monogenic cause of renal failure after autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Eighty per cent of patients have X-linked disease caused by mutations in the COL4A5 gene. Most of these result in the replacement of the collagen IV \u03b13\u03b14\u03b15 network with the \u03b11\u03b11\u03b12 heterotrimer. Affected membranes also have ectopic laminin and increased matrix metalloproteinase levels, which makes them more susceptible to proteolysis. Mechanical stress, due to the less elastic membrane and hypertension, interferes with integrin-mediated podocyte-GBM adhesion. Proteinuria occurs when urinary levels exceed tubular reabsorption rates, and initiates tubulointerstitial fibrosis. The glomerular mesangial cells produce increased TGF\u03b2 and CTGF which also contribute to glomerulosclerosis. Currently there is no specific therapy for Alport syndrome.

    "727": "The present investigation examined the effects of supplementation of milk peptide fractions produced by enzymatic hydrolysis on the fermentation of reconstituted skim milk (RSM). Changes in pH, cell growth, proteolytic activity, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity were monitored during fermentation of RSM by pure cultures of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, and Streptococcus thermophilus. The study showed that supplementation with peptide fractions of different molecular weights did not significantly affect the bacterial growth in RSM. All bacteria showed an increased proteolytic activity in RSM supplemented with large peptides (>10\u2009kDa), and L. helveticus in general exhibited the highest proteolytic activity among the bacteria studied. The ACE-inhibitory activity was observed to be the maximum in RSM supplemented with larger peptides (>10\u2009kDa) for all bacteria. The results suggest that proteolysis by bacteria leads to increased production of ACE-inhibitory peptides compared to the supplemented peptides produced by enzymatic hydrolysis.",

Impaired PCM was detected in 90 (70.3%) of the examined patients. According to the pattern of the previous therapy, all the 90 CKD patients with PCM disorders were divided into 3 groups: 1) 32 patients with Stages IIIB-V CKD who had taken oral alfacalcidol 0.25 microg/day; 2) 28 patients with Stages IIIB-V CKD who had used oral paricalcitol 1 microg/day; 3) 30 patients with Stages IIIB-V CKD who had not received, as self- motivated, active vitamin D metabolites at the predialysis stage.",

After 3 months of initiation of the use of these agents, Groups 1 and 2 patients with predialysis CKD and baseline elevated blood intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels could not only achieve, but also maintain target blood iPTH levels. In the patients taking paricalcitol, the urinary protein level decreased more promptly; moreover, by the end of month 6 the reduction in blood pressure (BP) was more significant than in those using alfacalcidol (p < 0.05). Comparison of the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in combination with alfacalcidol or paricalcitol on BP changes and left ventricular mass index indicated that the most pronounced positive changes occurred when angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were used in combination with paricalcitol.", 
    "731": "The use of paricalcitol in predialysis CKD with PTH hyperproduction results in not only normalization of the levels of both PTH and osseous isoenzyme of alkaline phosphatase, but also in significantly reduced daily proteinuria and regression of left ventricular hypertrophy and chronic heart failure.", 
    "732": "Food proteins are the source of peptides with many biological activities. One of them is their impact on blood circulatory system. This group of peptides includes the ones with the ability to reduce the blood pressure (inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme--ACE), antithrombotic, and to lower the cholesterol level. Among the above-mentioned peptides' bioactivities, the most of them act as the ACE inhibitors. Some of them are the functional food components and nutraceuticals and possess the status of food with special use. The main known source of antithrombotic and cholesterol lowering peptides are milk and soy proteins, respectively. However, the scientists make the efforts to find new alternative sources of peptides with the above-mentioned activities. It should be noted, that although the bioactive peptides are considered as the safe food components and thus be supportive in the cardiovascular diseases therapy, they cannot substitute the drugs. This review shows the characteristics of selected peptides with: blood pressure reducing, antithrombotic, and cholesterol level reducing activities. We focused on the sequences that were identified in food proteins as well as were tested on humans or animals.", 
    "733": "Heart rate is an easily accessible clinical variable with wide-ranging prognostic impact. Elevated resting heart rate predicts an elevated cardiovascular risk. Epidemiological studies demonstrate a relevant association between heart rate and survival in individuals without diagnosed cardiovascular disease and with cardiovascular disease like hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD) and heart failure. Whereas a goal directed pharmacological heart rate reduction is not supported by clinical evidence for primary prevention it plays a prognostic role for patients with CAD\u200a and chronic heart failure. Moreover heart rate can be characterized as an independent risk factor for patients with heart failure and potentially for those with CAD. As a result the common guidelines recommend heart rate reduction as a target of therapy.", 
    "734": "Open-heart surgery has become a common procedure. Postcardiac surgery management is a critical issue and represents a crucial period in terms of physical recovery. Cardiac rehabilitation is increasingly considered as an integral component of the continuum of care for patients with cardiovascular disease. Its usefulness is now widely accepted, and therefore, it is recommended in most contemporary cardiovascular clinical practice guidelines. Similarly, early pharmacological management can modulate the pathophysiological alterations after cardiac surgery, leading to an improvement in the early and long-term outcome. In this review, we will present recent advances in postcardiac surgery management, focusing on the pathophysiology of the perioperative period and on recent evidences in pharmacological and rehabilitative strategies.", 
    "735": "Glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL) is a heterodimer enzyme composed of a catalytic subunit (GCLC) and a modifier subunit (GCLM). This enzyme catalyses the synthesis of \u03b3-glutamylcysteine, a precursor of glutathione. cDNAs of the putative glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic (Ace-GCLC) and modifier subunits (Ace-GCLM) of Ancylostoma ceylanicum were cloned using the RACE-PCR amplification method. The Ace-gclc and Ace-gclm cDNAs encode proteins with 655 and 254 amino acids and calculated molecular masses of 74.76 and 28.51kDa, respectively. The Ace-GCLC amino acid sequence shares about 70% identity and 80% sequence similarity with orthologs in Loa loa, Onchocerca volvulus, Brugia malayi, and Ascaris suum, whereas the Ace-GCLM amino acid sequence has only about 30% sequence identity and 50% similarity to homologous proteins in those species. Real-time PCR analysis of mRNA expression in L3, serum stimulated L3 and adult stages of A. ceylanicum showed the highest level of Ace-GCLC and Ace-GCLM expression occurred in adult worms. No differences were detected among adult hookworms harvested 21 and 35dpi indicating expression of Ace-gclc and Ace-gclm in adult worms is constant during the course of infection. Positive interaction between two subunits of glutamate-cysteine ligase was detected using the yeast two-hybrid system, and by specific enzymatic reaction. Ace-GCL is an intracellular enzyme and is not exposed to the host immune system. Thus, as expected, we did not detect IgG antibodies against Ace-GCLC or Ace-GCLM on days 21, 60 and 120 of A. ceylanicum infection in hamsters. Furthermore, vaccination with one or both antigens did not reduce worm burdens, and resulted in no improvement of clinical parameters (hematocrit and hemoglobin) of infected hamsters. Therefore, due to the significant role of the enzyme in parasite metabolism, our analyses raises hope for the development of a successful new drug against ancylostomiasis based on the specific GCL inhibitor.",

After the endometriotic implants were formed surgically, the 24 rats were randomly divided into three groups. Group 1 (captopril group, eight rats) were given 50 mg kg(-1)d(-1) of oral captopril for 21 d. Group 2 (leuprolide acetate group, eight rats) were given a single 1 mg kg(-1) subcutaneous injection of leuprolide acetate. Group 3 (control) were given no medication and served as controls (eight rats). The surface area of the endometriotic implants and the score of histologic analysis. Also, VEGF and MCP-1 levels in peritoneal fluids and bloods were analyzed.", 
    "738": "At the beginning of the medical treatment, the mean surface areas of the endometriotic implants were comparable in all three groups. At the end of the treatment the mean implant surface area in the captopril group and leuprolide acetate group was less than that in the control group. Mean histopathological examination score for the implants post treatment was lower in the captopril and leuprolide acetate groups. Peritoneal fluids VEGF level in the captopril and leuprolide acetate groups was lower than that in the control group. The post-treatment MCP-1 level was also lower in the captopril and leuprolide acetate groups than in the control group. The serum VEGF and MCP-1 levels post treatment were significantly lower in the captopril and leuprolide acetate groups than in the control group.",

The mutant D-nLDHY52L/F299Y was then coexpressed with formate dehydrogenase in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) to construct a novel biocatalyst E. coli DF. Thus, a novel bio-reduction process utilizing whole cells of E. coli DF as the biocatalyst and formate as the co-substrate for cofactor regeneration was developed for the production of (R)-HPBA from OPBA. The biocatalysis conditions were then optimized.",

    "743": "The thioredoxin system, which consists of thioredoxin (Trx), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), has emerged as a major anti-oxidant involved in the maintenance of cellular physiology and survival. Dysregulation in this system has been associated with metabolic, cardiovascular, and malignant disorders. Thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP), also known as vitamin D-upregulated protein or thioredoxin-binding-protein-2, functions as a physiological inhibitor of Trx, and pathological suppression of Trx by TXNIP has been demonstrated in diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Furthermore, TXNIP effects are partially Trx-independent; these include direct activation of inflammation and inhibition of glucose uptake. Many of the effects of TXNIP are initiated by its dissociation from intra-nuclear binding with Trx or other SH-containing proteins: these effects include its migration to cytoplasm, modulating stress responses in mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum, and also potentially activating apoptotic pathways. TXNIP also interacts with the nitric oxide (NO) signaling system, with apparent suppression of NO effect. TXNIP production is modulated by redox stress, glucose levels, hypoxia and several inflammatory activators. In recent studies, it has been shown that therapeutic agents including insulin, metformin, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium channel blockers reduce TXNIP expression, although it is uncertain to what extent TXNIP suppression contributes to their clinical efficacy. This review addresses the role of TXNIP in health and in cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. Finally, the potential advantages (and disadvantages) of pharmacological suppression of TXNIP in cardiovascular disease and diabetes are summarized.",

In clinics, Uremic Clearance Granules (UCG), a compounded Chinese patent medicine, has been frequently used to treat chronic renal failure (CRF) patients for nearly 30 years, however, the deep therapeutic mechanisms involved in vivo remain a challenge. This study aims to demonstrate the effects and mechanisms of UCG on renal dysfunction and tubulointerstitial fibrosis by regulating extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1/Smad signaling activity in vivo, compared with enalapril.",

The rats with renal failure were induced by adenine (150 mg/kg/day) and unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO), and killed on day 35 after the administration. Proteinuria, urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (UNAG), blood biochemical parameters, renal morphological changes, collagen type IV (CIV), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9 and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1, as well as the key molecular protein expressions in TGF-beta1/Smad signaling pathway were observed, respectively.",

UCG treatment, however, significantly not only attenuated renal dysfunction and tubulointerstitial fibrosis, but also improved the protein expressions of MMP-2, TIMP-1, TGF-beta1, TGF-beta RI, p-Smad2/3, Smad4 and Smad7 in the kidney. Besides, the effects of UCG were stronger than those of enalapril partly.", 
    "747": "UCG similar to enalapril, is renoprotective via ameliorating renal dysfunction and tubulointerstitial fibrosis in the renal failure model. The potential mechanisms by which UCG exerts its therapeutical effects in vivo are through promoting ECM degradation and regulating MMP-2/TIMP-1 balance or signaling molecular activity in TGF-beta1/Smad pathway in the kidney. These findings suggest that UCG treatment is undoubtedly useful in preventing the progression of CRF.", 
    "748": "The angiotensin type 2 receptor, AT2R, has been described as having opposite effects to the angiotensin type 1 receptor, AT1R. Although the quantities of the AT2R found in the adult are low, its expression rises in pathological situations. The AT2R has three major signaling pathways: activation of serine/threonine phosphatases (promoting apoptosis and antioxidant effects), activation of the bradykinin/NO/cGMP pathway (promoting vasodilation), and activation of phospholipase A2 (associated with regulation of potassium currents). The AT2R appears to have effects in vascular remodeling, atherosclerosis prevention and blood pressure lowering (when associated with an AT1R inhibitor). After myocardial infarction, the AT2R appears to decrease infarct size, cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, and to improve cardiac function. However, its role in the heart is controversial. In the kidney, the AT2R promotes natriuresis. Until now, treatment directed at the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system has been based on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin type 1 receptor blockers. The study of the AT2R has been revolutionized by the discovery of a direct agonist, C21, which promises to become part of the treatment of cardiovascular disease.", 
    "749": "While conventional parameters used to detect hepatotoxicity in drug safety assessment studies are generally informative, the need remains for parameters that can detect the potential for hepatotoxicity at lower doses and/or at earlier time points. Previous work has shown that metabolite profiling (metabonomics/metabolomics) can detect signals of potential hepatotoxicity in rats treated with doxorubicin at doses that do not elicit hepatotoxicity as monitored with conventional parameters. The current study extended this observation to the question of whether such signals could be detected in rats treated with compounds that can elicit hepatotoxicity in humans (i.e., drug-induced liver injury, DILI) but have not been reported to do so in rats. Nine compounds were selected on the basis of their known DILI potential, with six other compounds chosen as negative for DILI potential. A database of rat plasma metabolite profiles, MetaMap(\u00ae)Tox (developed by metanomics GmbH and BASF SE) was used for both metabolite profiles and mode of action (MoA) metabolite signatures for a number of known toxicities. Eight of the nine compounds with DILI potential elicited metabolite profiles that matched with MoA patterns of various rat liver toxicities, including cholestasis, oxidative stress, acetaminophen-type toxicity and peroxisome proliferation. By contrast, only one of the six non-DILI compounds showed a weak match with rat liver toxicity. These results suggest that metabolite profiling may indeed have promise to detect signals of hepatotoxicity in rats treated with compounds having DILI potential.",

This study investigated the ability of the highly intriguing amino acid L-arginine to influence endothelial function. Its therapeutic potential is also compared to that of known cardiovascular medications, namely nitroglycerin [a nitric oxide (NO) donor] and enalapril [an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor]. Fifty male New Zealand rabbits were included in the study, divided into 5 equal groups: control, hypercholesterolemia (untreated), hypercholesterolemia (+L-arginine), hypercholesterolemia (+enalapril), and hypercholesterolemia (+nitroglycerin). Biochemical investigations included measurement of circulating NOx, malondialdehyde (MDA), and lipid profile markers, as well as dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH) and ACE activities. Furthermore, aortic ACE activity and blood platelet aggregation were estimated. A histopathological examination and intimal thickness measurement were also conducted. Compared to the untreated hypercholesterolemic group, all agents were capable of positively influencing MDA levels, platelet aggregation and intimal thickness; however, only the L-arginine group was capable of beneficially and significantly altering both NOx levels and serum and aortic ACE activities. No agents were capable of modulating serum DDAH activity inhibited by hypercholesterolemia. Based on the results of this study, L-arginine appears to be a novel cardio-protective agent, illustrated by its ability to ameliorate the deleterious effects of hypercholesterolemia on endothelial function, in a manner comparable to, and sometimes more potent than, commonly used cardiovascular medications.",

Experiments on 'spontaneously hypertensive rats' (SHRs) were carried out to test the anti-hypertension activity in vivo, which confirmed that the hydrolysates played a significant role in reducing both diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and systolic blood pressure (SBP). Consistently, the in vivo anti-hypertensive activity of the hydrolysis products of pepsin and trypsin used together was also higher than that by using pepsin hydrolysis products alone. As stated in both sets of results, we believe that P. esculenta is an excellent resource of antihypertensive peptides and warrants further investigation.", 
    "773": "Renal transplantation is the treatment of choice in patients with end-stage renal disease. Major adverse cardiac events (MACE) are common after renal transplant, especially in the perioperative period, leading to excess morbidity and mortality. The predictors and long-term prognostic implications of MACE are poorly understood. We analyzed predictors and implications of MACE in a cohort of 321 consecutive adult patients, who received renal allograft transplantation between 1995 and 2003 at our institution. The characteristics of 321 patients were: age at transplant 44\u2009\u00b1\u200913 years, 60% male, 36% diabetes mellitus (DM), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 60\u2009\u00b1\u200916%. MACE occurred in 21 patients with cumulative rate of 6.5% over 3 years after renal transplant, 57% occurring within 30 days, 67% within 90 days, and 86% within 180 days. MACE was not predicted by any clinical or pharmacological variables including age, gender, hypertension, DM, prior myocardial infarction, smoking, duration of dialysis, LVEF, or therapy with \u03b2-blockers (BB), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, or calcium channel blockers. However, a clinical decision to perform a stress test or a coronary angiogram was predictive of higher MACE rate. MACE, irrespective of type, was independently associated with higher mortality over a period up to 15 years and this seemed to be blunted by BB therapy. MACE rate after renal transplantation decreases over time, most occurring in the first 90 days and is not predicted by any of the traditional risk factors or drug therapies. It is associated with higher long-term mortality.", 
    "774": "Although the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) was classically considered as a circulating system that regulates blood pressure, many tissues are now known to have a local RAS. Angiotensin, via type 1 receptors, is a major activator of the NADPH-oxidase complex, which mediates several key events in oxidative stress (OS) and inflammatory processes involved in the pathogenesis of major aging-related diseases. Several studies have demonstrated the presence of RAS components in the basal ganglia, and particularly in the nigrostriatal system. In the nigrostriatal system, RAS hyperactivation, via NADPH-oxidase complex activation, exacerbates OS and the microglial inflammatory response and contributes to progression of dopaminergic degeneration, which is inhibited by angiotensin receptor blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Several factors may induce an increase in RAS activity in the dopaminergic system. A decrease in dopaminergic activity induces compensatory upregulation of local RAS function in both dopaminergic neurons and glia. In addition to its role as an essential neurotransmitter, dopamine may also modulate microglial inflammatory responses and neuronal OS via RAS. Important counterregulatory interactions between angiotensin and dopamine have also been observed in several peripheral tissues. Neurotoxins and proinflammatory factors may also act on astrocytes to induce an increase in RAS activity, either independently of or before the loss of dopamine. Consistent with a major role of RAS in dopaminergic vulnerability, increased RAS activity has been observed in the nigra of animal models of aging, menopause and chronic cerebral hypoperfusion, which also showed higher dopaminergic vulnerability. Manipulation of the brain RAS may constitute an effective neuroprotective strategy against dopaminergic vulnerability and progression of Parkinson's disease.",

No statistical significant difference was detected in the mean level of serum ACE of the two groups (t-test, P = 0.11). The mean ACE level was significantly lower in male patients compared with male controls (P = 0.04). Moreover, a significant higher serum ACE level of patients with cutaneous involvement was observed compared to patients with mucosal involvement (P = 0.02).", 
    "779": "Despite lack of any significant difference of serum ACE level between pemphigus and control group, the serum ACE level was considerably lower in male pemphigus vulgaris patients compared with male controls.

Moreover, increased blood pressure often coexists with additional cardiovascular risk factors such as insulin resistance. As a result the need for a comprehensive management of hypertensive patients is critical. However, the various antihypertensive drug categories have different effects on glucose metabolism. Indeed, angiotensin receptor blockers as well as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors have been associated with beneficial effects on glucose homeostasis. Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) have an overall neutral effect on glucose metabolism. However, some members of the CCBs class such as azelnidipine and manidipine have been shown to have advantageous effects on glucose homeostasis. On the other hand, diuretics and \u03b2-blockers have an overall disadvantageous effect on glucose metabolism. Of note, carvedilol as well as nebivolol seem to differentiate themselves from the rest of the \u03b2-blockers class, being more attractive options regarding their effect on glucose homeostasis. The adverse effects of some blood pressure lowering drugs on glucose metabolism may, to an extent, compromise their cardiovascular protective role. As a result the effects on glucose homeostasis of the various blood pressure lowering drugs should be taken into account when selecting an antihypertensive treatment, especially in patients which are at high risk for developing diabetes.",

In this comprehensive review, we would like to summarize the potential relationship between diabetes and atrial remodeling, including structural, electrical, and autonomic remodeling. Also, some upstream therapies, such as thiazolidinediones, probucol, ACEI/ARBs, may play an important role in the prevention and treatment of AF.

    "795": "Albeit hypertension is a leading risk factor for an initial stroke, the role of blood pressure (BP) lowering to prevent a subsequent stroke is controversial. The present systematic review searched randomized trials published from January 1990 to January 2014 with the aim to assess antihypertensive treatment effects on recurrent stroke prevention. Seven randomized placebo-controlled trials enrolling 49,518 patients, two randomized trials not placebo controlled comparing antihypertensive drugs, and one randomized trial that compared the effects of intensive systolic BP lowering with a more conservative systolic BP management, were identified. The placebo-controlled trials had substantial methodological differences, explaining the difficulties to compare their results. An important obstacle arises from the large dispersion in the window's time between the qualifying stroke and randomization. Another barrier is the variation among studies in the recruited patient's stroke subtypes. Differences between trials could not be attributed to disparity in lowering BP or to different degrees of no adherence. The American Heart Association/American Stroke Association stated that although an absolute target of BP level has not been clearly defined, a reduction in recurrent stroke has been associated with an average lowering of 10/5\u00a0mm Hg. It should be taken into account that it is not advisable to reduce BP levels to <120/80 mm Hg. It should carry out an individualized selection, based on demographic characteristics and comorbidities (cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and chronic disease) among diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, or calcium channel blockers.",

Twenty-four 10-week-old male SHRs were divided into fosinopril and non-fosinopril groups (n\u2009=\u200912 each). Twelve 10-week-old Wistar-Kyoto rats were used a control group. Left ventricular mass index and ventricular fibrillation threshold (VFT) were measured after 8 weeks of fosinopril or saline treatment. L-type calcium current (I CaL), sodium current (I Na), and transient outward potassium current (I to) were measured in left ventricular myocytes after 8 weeks of fosinopril or saline treatment using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. VFT was higher in the fosinopril group than in the non-fosinopril group (17.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.2 mA vs. 15.6\u2009\u00b1\u20091.1 mA, P\u2009<\u20090.01).

However, for the change in central aortic diastolic pressure, the least squares mean between-treatment difference (-3.6 mmHg [95% confidence interval, -6.76, -0.43; P=0.0263]) was in favor of aliskiren, while the other changes were comparable between the two groups with a trend in favor of aliskiren for CASP as well (-2.6 mmHg [95% confidence interval, -7.38, 2.19; P=0.2855)]. Correlation coefficients for change from baseline between CASP and systolic BP and between central aortic pulse pressure and PP (r=0.8, P<0.0001) were highly significant.",

    "802": "The epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) of the kidney is necessary for extracellular volume homeostasis and normal arterial BP. Activity of ENaC is enhanced by proteolytic cleavage of the \u03b3-subunit and putative release of a 43-amino acid inhibitory tract from the \u03b3-subunit ectodomain. We hypothesized that proteolytic processing of \u03b3ENaC occurs in the human kidney under physiologic conditions and that proteinuria contributes to aberrant proteolytic activation. Here, we used monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with specificity to the human 43-mer inhibitory tract (N and C termini, mAbinhibit, and mAb4C11) and the neoepitope generated after proteolytic cleavage at the prostasin/kallikrein cleavage site (K181-V182 and mAbprostasin) to examine human nephrectomy specimens. By immunoblotting, kidney cortex homogenate from patients treated with angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists (n=6) or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (n=6) exhibited no significant difference in the amount of full-length or furin-cleaved \u03b3ENaC or the furin-cleaved-to-full-length ratio of \u03b3ENaC compared with homogenate from patients on no medication (n=5). Patients treated with diuretics (n=4) displayed higher abundance of full-length and furin-cleaved \u03b3ENaC, with no significant change in the furin-cleaved-to-full-length \u03b3ENaC ratio. In patients with proteinuria (n=6), the inhibitory tract was detected only in full-length \u03b3ENaC by mAbinhibit. Prostasin/kallikrein-cleaved \u03b3ENaC was detected consistently only in tissue from patients with proteinuria and observed in collecting ducts. In conclusion, human kidney \u03b3ENaC is subject to proteolytic cleavage, yielding fragments compatible with furin cleavage, and proteinuria is associated with cleavage at the putative prostasin/kallikrein site and removal of the inhibitory tract within \u03b3ENaC.", 
    "803": "Acute reduction of portal vein blood flow (Qpv) increases hepatic arterial perfusion (Qha) [the hepatic arterial buffer response (HABR)]. Angiotensin II (AT-II) reduces Qpv, but its effect on HABR is not known. We explored interactions of AT-II and enalapril with hepatic blood flow regulation. Twenty healthy anesthetized pigs were randomized to receive AT-II (n = 8) from 5 to 61 ng/kg per min, enalapril (n = 8) from 3 to 24 \u03bcg/kg per h, or saline (n = 4). HABR was assessed by occluding portal vein and expressed as 1) ratio between changes in Qha and Qpv, 2) hepatic arterial conductance (Cha). AT-II infusion increased mean arterial blood pressure from 74 (66-77) mmHg to 116 (109-130) mmHg (median, IQR; P < 0.0001) and decreased cardiac output, Qpv, and renal artery flow (-24%, -28% and -45%, respectively). The fraction of cardiac output of Qha, carotid, and femoral flows increased. With enalapril, blood pressure decreased, whereas cardiac output was maintained with flow redistribution favoring hepatic and renal arteries. In AT-II group, dQha/dQpv increased from 0.06 (0.03, 0.17) to 0.24 (0.13, 0.31) (P = 0.002), but Cha during acute portal vein occlusion decreased from 4.3 (1.6, 6.6) to 2.9 (1.2, 3.7) ml/mmHg (P = 0.003). Both variables remained unchanged in the enalapril group and in controls. AT-II infusion reduces portal flow in parallel with cardiac output and induces a dose-dependent redistribution of flow, favoring brain, hepatic artery, and peripheral tissues at the expense of renal perfusion. During HABR, AT-II decreases Cha but increases Qha compensation, likely as result of increased hepatic arterial perfusion pressure. Enalapril had no effect on HABR.",

Because cough and angioedema are considered class adverse effects, switching treatment to other ACE-I agents is not recommended. Angioedema due to ACE-I has a low fatality rate, although deaths have been reported when the angioedema involves the airways. Here, we review the role of bradykinin in the development of angioedema in patients treated with ACE-I, as well as the incidence, risk factors, clinical presentation, and available treatments for ACE-I-induced angioedema. We also discuss the risk for recurrence of angioedema after switching from ACE-I to angiotensin receptor blockers treatment.", 
    "814": "The sodium-coupled neutral amino acid transporter 2 (SNAT2) translocates small neutral amino acids into the mammary gland to promote cell proliferation during gestation. It is known that SNAT2 expression increases during pregnancy, and in vitro studies indicate that this transporter is induced by 17\u03b2-estradiol. In this study, we elucidated the mechanism by which 17\u03b2-estradiol regulates the transcription of SNAT2. In silico analysis revealed the presence of a potential estrogen response element (ERE) in the SNAT2 promoter. Reporter assays showed an increase in SNAT2 promoter activity when cotransfected with estrogen receptor alpha (ER-\u03b1) after 17\u03b2-estradiol stimulation. Deletion of the ERE reduced estradiol-induced promoter activity by 63%. Additionally, EMSAs and supershift assays showed that ER-\u03b1 binds to the SNAT2 ERE and that this binding competes with the interaction of ER-\u03b1 with its consensus ERE. An in vivo ChIP assay demonstrated that the binding of ER-\u03b1 to the SNAT2 promoter gradually increased in the mammary gland during gestation and that maximal binding occurred at the highest 17\u03b2-estradiol serum concentration. Liquid chromatography-elevated energy mass spectrometry and Western blot analysis revealed that the SNAT2 ER-\u03b1-ERE complex contained poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1, Lupus Ku autoantigen protein p70, and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) proteins and that the silencing of each of these proteins nearly abolished 17\u03b2-estradiol-stimulated SNAT2 promoter activity. Nuclear levels of GAPDH increased progressively during gestation in the mammary gland, and GAPDH binding was nucleotide-specific for the SNAT2 ERE. Thus, this study provides new insights into how the mammary epithelium adapts to control amino acid uptake through the transcriptional regulation of the SNAT2 transporter via 17\u03b2-estradiol.",

Compared with the control group, the levels of blood glucose, triglycerides, and creatinine were significantly increased in the ICH group, along with a marked reduction in nocturnal BP drop (P<.05). Multivariate logistic regression indicated that blood glucose, creatinine, and nocturnal mean arterial pressure were risk factors for ICH, and the magnitude of nocturnal BP drop was negatively related to the risk for ICH. There was no significant difference in the prevalence of reverse dippers between the large hematoma volume group and the small hematoma volume group (\u03c7(2) =2.529, P=.112), nor among the patients taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or calcium channel blockers (\u03c7(2) =1.981, P=.371).

In fully adjusted models, APOL1 risk variants were significantly associated with lower levels of carotid artery-calcified plaque (\u03b2=-0.42, s.e. 0.18; dominant model) and marginally lower coronary artery plaque (\u03b2=-0.36, s.e. 0.21; dominant model), but not with aorta-calcified plaque, CRP, UACR, or eGFR. By the end of a mean follow-up of 5.0 years, 89 participants had died. APOL1 nephropathy risk variants were significantly associated with improved survival (hazard ratio 0.67 for one copy; 0.44 for two copies). Thus, APOL1 nephropathy variants associate with lower levels of subclinical atherosclerosis and reduced risk of death in AAs with type 2 diabetes mellitus.", 
    "817": "Somatic angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) contains two active sites, the C- and N-domain, from which the C-domain is supposed to play a major role in blood pressure regulation and is therefore a promising pharmacological target to reduce blood pressure without side-effects. We report for the first time that tryptophan-containing dipeptides such as Ile-Trp or Val-Trp, which were recently found in food protein hydrolysates, are selective and competitive inhibitors for the C-domain with a selectivity factor of 40 and 70, respectively. Structure-activity studies showed that an N-terminal aliphatic amino acid and a tryptophan moiety in the P2' position are favourable structures for C-domain inhibition in dipeptides. In contrast, the lactotripeptides Ile-Pro-Pro and Val-Pro-Pro, which were widely used as ingredients for hypotensive food, showed a slight selectivity for the N-domain. Hence, tryptophan containing dipeptides are interesting ingredients for functional foods as a natural prevention for hypertension with reduced side effects due to its selective inhibition of the C-domain.",

Forty-one type 2 diabetic patients with uncontrolled hypertension in spite of using angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) were enrolled in the study. The patients were randomized in two groups. First group received amlodipin (5-10 mg/d) and second group verapamil (120-240 mg/d) for 6 weeks. The difference between two calcium channel blocker treatments was investigated by analyzing urinary albumin excretion and plasma PEDF levels of patients at the end of 6 weeks. Urinary microalbumin/creatinine values were decreased in both amlodipin and verapamil groups but it was not statistically significant. Plasma PEDF levels also decreased significantly in both groups at the end of the treatment (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). At the end of the treatment there was no significant difference between changes in values of systolic BP, diastolic BP, microalbumin/creatinine and PEDF percentage in both groups (p = 0.788, p = 0.926, p = 0.908, p = 0.140, respectively). PEDF values showed a positive correlation with microalbumin/creatinine, hb A1c, FBS, systolic and diastolic BP levels. It was observed that both of the drugs have similar effects on nefhropathy and PEDF at the end of the treatment. In this study, we suggest that calcium channel blockers may have renoprotective effects by different mechanisms except their antihypertensive effects and this may be important to determine the selection of antihypertensive drug combinations in diabetic nephropathy.",

A single-center, retrospective analysis of 1003 adult RTRs from January 1, 2000 to May 1, 2008 to inspect the impact of race on post-transplant CV events, treatment of CV risk factors and their independent influence on graft outcomes was performed. AAs experienced a higher incidence of late graft loss, with 1- and 5-year graft survival rates of 93% and 76% vs 95% and 84% in the non-AA group, respectively. AA patients had a higher prevalence of hypertension (HTN) and diabetes mellitus (DM) and demonstrated reduced control of DM post-transplant (AA 74% vs non-AA 82%, p = 0.053). Multivariate analysis for graft survival indicated acute rejection, delayed graft function (DGF) and incidence of CV events were significant risk factors for graft failure, while the use of beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors were protective. In conclusion, after controlling for CV risk factors and events, race did not have an independent effect on outcomes, suggesting CV risk factors and events contribute to this disparity. Clinical summary. AAs experienced a higher rate of graft failure and CV events; after adjusting for multiple immunological and CV risk factors, race no longer remained an independent risk factor for post-transplant CV events or graft failure; although disparities in post-transplant outcomes remain, race alone does not account for the disparity; the racial disparity is due to the higher incidence of DGF and acute rejection, as well as traditional CV risk factors, including HTN and DM.", 
    "829": "Hyperkalemia is a common clinical condition that can be defined as a serum potassium concentration exceeding 5.0\u00a0mmol/L. Drug-induced hyperkalemia is the most important cause of increased potassium levels in everyday clinical practice. Drug-induced hyperkalemia may be asymptomatic. However, it may be dramatic and life threatening, posing diagnostic and management problems. A wide range of drugs can cause hyperkalemia by a variety of mechanisms. Drugs can interfere with potassium homoeostasis either by promoting transcellular potassium shift or by impairing renal potassium excretion. Drugs may also increase potassium supply. The reduction in renal potassium excretion due to inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system represents the most important mechanism by which drugs are known to cause hyperkalemia. Medications that alter transmembrane potassium movement include amino acids, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, suxamethonium, and mannitol. Drugs that impair renal potassium excretion are mainly represented by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-II receptor blockers, direct renin inhibitors, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, calcineurin inhibitors, heparin and derivatives, aldosterone antagonists, potassium-sparing diuretics, trimethoprim, and pentamidine. Potassium-containing agents represent another group of medications causing hyperkalemia. Increased awareness of drugs that can induce hyperkalemia, and monitoring and prevention are key elements for reducing the number of hospital admissions, morbidity, and mortality related to drug-induced hyperkalemia.", 
    "830": "Previous studies showed that chronically stressed and myocardially infarcted rats respond with exaggerated cardiovascular responses to acute stress. The present experiments were designed to elucidate whether this effect can be abolished by treatment with the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril. Sprague Dawley rats were subjected either to sham surgery (Groups 1 and 2) or to myocardial infarction (Groups 3 and 4). The rats of Groups 2 and 4 were also exposed to mild chronic stressing. Four weeks after the operation, mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) and heart rate (HR) were measured under resting conditions and after application of acute stress. The cardiovascular responses to the acute stress were determined again 24\u2009h after administration of captopril orally. Captopril significantly reduced resting MABP in each group. Before administration of captopril, the maximum increases in MABP evoked by the acute stressor in all (infarcted and sham-operated) chronically stressed rats and also in the infarcted nonchronically stressed rats were significantly greater than in the sham-operated rats not exposed to chronic stressing. These differences were abolished by captopril. The results suggest that ACE may improve tolerance of acute stress in heart failure and during chronic stressing.",

Moreover, the bacterial tumor delivery was significantly increased by a nitric oxide (NO) donor nitroglycerin (NG, 10-70 times) and an angiotensin II converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril (6-18 times). Consequently significant suppression of tumor growth was found in a colon cancer C26 model, and more remarkable antitumor effect was achieved when L. casei was combined with NG, probably by modulating the host nonspecific immune responses; tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 significantly increased in tumor after the treatment, as well as NO synthase activity and myleoperoxidase activity.

Based on the outcome of these studies, a new type of fermentation bed composed of rice bran and white miso has been successfully developed. The advantage of such pickles is that they not only contain both GABA and ACE-inhibitory peptides, but also that their taste and flavor are excellent, with colors close to the original ones. The new type of pickles could temporarily reduce blood pressure in two types of rats, spontaneously hypertensive rats and NaCl-sensitive model rats. Thus, the newly developed pickles appear to be beneficial for pickle business.",

However, other adverse effects of upper airways such as postnasal drainage, rhinitis and nasal blockage, are less frequently recognised. These might share the same pathophysiological mechanism: bradykinin accumulation. We present two patients with ACE inhibitor-induced upper respiratory symptoms that improved after the discontinuation of ACE-inhibitors and substitution with angiotensin II receptor blockers. The incidence of these adverse events is not accurately known, since these are not required to be reported, but it is estimated to be low. This presents challenges to the physician and demonstrates the importance of keeping it as a differential diagnosis. Most physicians are aware of ACE inhibitor-induced cough but not of ACE inhibitor-induced nasal blockage, rhinitis or postnasal drainage. Identifying these can avoid unnecessary diagnostic tests and inappropriate treatment.",

This increase in oxidative damage was also accompanied by a rise in catalase activity (P\u200a<\u200a0.05) and low-molecular-weight antioxidants only when they were measured as total antioxidant capacity (P\u200a<\u200a0.01). In order to establish the specific oxidative status of each group, new indexes of oxidative damage and antioxidant defense were calculated with all these markers following a mathematical and statistical approach. Although both pro-oxidant and antioxidant indexes were significantly increased in patients with albuminuria, only the oxidative damage index positively correlated with the increase of albumin/creatinine ratio (P\u200a=\u200a0.0024).",

This was the last in a series of trials on the value of dual versus single blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in patients at risk for renal or cardiovascular complications. From these studies, the picture has emerged that dual blockade is hardly effective and increases the risk of hyperkalaemia and renal failure. Background use of beta blockers - little recognised indirect renin inhibitors - may play a role in the detrimental effects of dual blockade. Aldosterone antagonists in combination with one of the RAAS inhibitors may confer some benefit, but have not been studied sufficiently.

The aim of the study was to examine whether angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) or renin inhibitors protect against ADR-induced mitochondrial function impairment. Rats were divided into five groups as control, ADR, co-treatment ADR with captopril, co-treatment ADR with aliskiren, co-treatment ADR with both captopril and aliskiren. Left ventricular function and blood pressures were assessed at the end of treatment period. Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and ATP levels were determined. ADR treatment decreased the left ventricular pressure and increased the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. ADR decreased MMP and ATP levels in myocyte mitochondria due to increasing oxidative stress. ADR decreased MMP and ATP levels due to increased oxidative stress in the heart. Inhibitors of ACE and renin caused the elevation of the decreased of MMP and ATP levels. The pathologic changes in electrocardiogram, blood pressure and left ventricular function were decreased by inhibition of Ang-II production. We concluded that inhibitors of angiotensin II are effective against ADR cardiotoxicity via the restoration of MMP and ATP production and prevention of mitochondrial damage in vivo.",

The receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed 76% sensitivity and 82% specificity for a GSM of 29 (p < 0.001) as a cutoff point for unstable plaques. A logistic regression model indicated that a GSM <29, male gender and not having been treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were independently associated with an unstable plaque classification. A probability model for unstable plaques was achieved by combining the strength of each variable (high blood pressure, hypercholesterolemia, smoking, previous stroke, anti-hypertensive drugs, calcium channel blockers, intima-media thickness). The model was tested with receiver operating characteristic curve analysis (p < 0.001) and validated by the leave-one-out cross-validation method (p < 0.001).

The aim of this work was to utilize known in silico methodologies, peptide databases and software including ProtParam (http://web.expasy.org/protparam/), Basic Local Alignment Tool (BLAST), ExPASy PeptideCutter (http://web.expasy.org/peptide_cutter/) and BIOPEP (http://www.uwm.edu.pl/biochemia/index.php/pl/biopep) to assess the release of potentially bioactive DPP-IV, renin and ACE-I inhibitory peptides from bovine and porcine meat proteins including hemoglobin, collagen and serum albumin. These proteins were chosen as they are found commonly in meat by-products such as bone, blood and low-value meat cuts. In addition, the bioactivities of identified peptides were confirmed using chemical synthesis and in vitro bioassays. The concentration of peptide required to inhibit the activity of ACE-I and DPP-IV by 50% was determined for selected, active peptides. Novel ACE-I and DPP-IV inhibitory peptides were identified in this study using both in silico analysis and a literature search to streamline enzyme selection for peptide production. These novel peptides included the ACE-I inhibitory tri-peptide Ile-Ile-Tyr and the DPP-IV inhibitory tri-peptide Pro-Pro-Leu corresponding to sequences f (182-184) and f (326-328) of both porcine and bovine serum albumin which can be released following hydrolysis with the enzymes papain and pepsin, respectively.

    "906": "Using adult Cav1(-/-) mice, we revealed a marked reduction in the left ventricular conduction velocity in the absence of myocardial Cav1, which is accompanied with increased inducibility of ventricular arrhythmias. Further studies demonstrated that loss of Cav1 leads to the activation of cSrc tyrosine kinase, resulting in the downregulation of connexin 43 and subsequent electric abnormalities. Pharmacological inhibition of cSrc mitigates connexin 43 downregulation, slowed conduction, and arrhythmia inducibility in Cav1(-/-) animals. Using a transgenic mouse model with cardiac-specific overexpression of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE8/8), we demonstrated that, on enhanced cardiac renin-angiotensin system activity, Cav1 dissociated from cSrc because of increased Cav1 S-nitrosation at Cys(156), leading to cSrc activation, connexin 43 reduction, impaired gap junction function, and subsequent increase in the propensity for ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Renin-angiotensin system-induced Cav1 S-nitrosation was associated with increased Cav1-endothelial nitric oxide synthase binding in response to increased mitochondrial reactive oxidative species generation.", 
    "907": "The present studies reveal the critical role of Cav1 in modulating cSrc activation, gap junction remodeling, and ventricular arrhythmias. These data provide a mechanistic explanation for the observed genetic link between Cav1 and cardiac arrhythmias in humans and suggest that targeted regulation of Cav1 may reduce arrhythmic risk in cardiac diseases associated with renin-angiotensin system activation.",

Proteolysis was monitored by urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (urea-PAGE) and reversed phase-HPLC (RP-HPLC) of water-insoluble and -soluble fractions of the cheeses, respectively. Urea-PAGE patterns of the samples revealed that the intensities of the bands representing casein fractions decreased in the experimental cheeses, being more pronounced in the cheeses made with adjunct cultures. Similarly, peptide profiles and the concentrations of individual and total free amino acids were influenced by both the adjunct cultures and ripening temperatures. The ACE-inhibitory activity of the water-soluble extracts of the cheeses were higher in the cheeses made using adjunct cultures (especially Lb. helveticus) and ripened at 12\u00a0\u00b0C. The ACE-inhibitory activity did not decrease during ripening. The contribution of Lb. helveticus to the development of proteolysis and ACE-inhibitory peptide activities were higher than that of Lb. casei. To conclude, the use of Lb. helveticus as adjunct culture in white-brined cheese and ripening at 12\u00a0\u00b0C would be recommended to obtain white-brined cheese with high ACE-I-inhibitory peptides activity and higher levels of preoteolysis.",

    "913": "Hyperkalemia commonly limits optimizing treatment to slow stage 3 or higher chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression. The risk of hyperkalemia is linked to dietary potassium intake, level of kidney function, concomitant diseases that may affect potassium balance such as diabetes, and use of medications that influence potassium excretion. The risk predictors for developing hyperkalemia are an estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m(2) and a serum potassium level greater than 4.5 mEq/L in the absence of blockers of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Generally, monotherapy with RAAS blockers does not increase risk substantially unless hypotension or volume depletion occur. Dual RAAS blockade involving any combination of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin-receptor blocker, renin inhibition, or aldosterone-receptor blocker markedly increases the risk of hyperkalemia in patients with stage 3 or higher CKD. Moreover, dual RAAS blockade further reduces albuminuria by 25% to 30% compared with monotherapy, it has failed to show a benefit on CKD progression or cardiovascular outcome, and thus is not indicated in such patients because of its marked increase in hyperkalemia potential. Although sodium polystyrene resins exist to manage hyperkalemia in patients requiring therapy that increases serum potassium levels, they are not well tolerated. Newer, more predictable, better-tolerated polymers to bind potassium are on the horizon and may be approved within the next 1 to 2 years.", 
    "914": "Although blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers has become standard therapy for chronic kidney disease (CKD), renewed interest in the role of aldosterone in mediating the injuries and progressive insults of CKD has highlighted the potential role of treatments targeting the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR). Although salt restriction is an important component of mitigating the profibrotic effects of MR activation, a growing body of literature has shown that MR antagonists, spironolactone and eplerenone, can reduce proteinuria and blood pressure in patients at all stages of CKD. These agents carry a risk of hyperkalemia, but this risk likely can be predicted based on baseline renal function and mitigated using dietary modifications and adjustments of concomitant medications. Data on hard outcomes, such as progression to end-stage renal disease and overall mortality, still are lacking in patients with CKD.",

    "931": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays an important role in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disorders. Pharmacologic interventions targeting the RAS cascade have led to the discovery of renin inhibitors, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and AT(1) receptor blockers (ARBs) to treat hypertension and some cardiovascular and renal disorders. Mutagenesis and modeling studies have revealed that differential functional outcomes are the results of multiple active states conformed by the AT(1) receptor upon interaction with angiotensin II (Ang II). The binding of agonist is dependent on both extracellular and intramembrane regions of the receptor molecule, and as a consequence occupies more extensive area of the receptor than a non-peptide antagonist. Both agonist and antagonist bind to the same intramembrane regions to interfere with each other's binding to exhibit competitive, surmountable interaction. The nature of interactions with the amino acids in the receptor is different for each of the ARBs given the small differences in the molecular structure between drugs. AT(1) receptors attain different conformation states after binding various Ang II analogues, resulting in variable responses through activation of multiple signaling pathways. These include both classical and non-classical pathways mediated through growth factor receptor transactivations, and provide cross-communication between downstream signaling molecules. The structural requirements for AT(1) receptors to activate extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 through G proteins, or G protein-independently through \u03b2-arrestin, are different. We review the structural and functional characteristics of Ang II and its analogs and antagonists, and their interaction with amino acid residues in the AT(1) receptor.",

However, the specific effects of local ACE on renal function and, by extension, BP control are not completely understood. We previously showed that mice lacking renal ACE, are resistant to the hypertension induced by angiotensin II infusion. Here, we examined the responses of these mice to the low-systemic angiotensin II hypertensive model of nitric oxide synthesis inhibition with L-NAME. In contrast to wild-type mice, mice without renal ACE did not develop hypertension, had lower renal angiotensin II levels, and enhanced natriuresis in response to L-NAME. During L-NAME treatment, the absence of renal ACE was associated with blunted GFR responses; greater reductions in abundance of proximal tubule Na(+)/H(+) exchanger 3, Na(+)/Pi co-transporter 2, phosphorylated Na(+)/K(+)/Cl(-) cotransporter, and phosphorylated Na(+)/Cl(-) cotransporter; and greater reductions in abundance and processing of the \u03b3 isoform of the epithelial Na(+) channel. In summary, the presence of ACE in renal tissue facilitates angiotensin II accumulation, GFR reductions, and changes in the expression levels and post-translational modification of sodium transporters that are obligatory for sodium retention and hypertension in response to nitric oxide synthesis inhibition.",

As there have been no randomized trials of treatment for TRH, the physician confronted with such cases must devise treatments on the basis of observational data and pathophysiological reasoning (volume status considering renin levels, sympathetic blockade, vasodilatation).

Patients with ventricular dysfunction had greater infarct size, assessed by the measurement of total and isoenzyme MB creatine kinase enzymes, than patients without dysfunction. Additionally, 24.5% of patients that initially had systolic dysfunction showed recovery within 6 months after AMI. Patients who recovered ventricular function had smaller infarct sizes, but larger values of ejection fraction and E-wave deceleration time than patients without recovery.

Firstly, the protein fractions (caseins and whey proteins) were separated by ultrafiltration through a 0\u00b714\u00a0\u03bcm ceramic membrane. The casein fraction obtained in the retentate stream of the above filtration step was subsequently hydrolysed with a combination of subtilisin and trypsin. After 3\u00a0h of reaction, the hydrolysate produced presented an IC50 of 218\u00b750\u00a0\u03bcg/ml, which represent a relatively high ACE inhibitory activity. Finally, this hydrolysate was filtered through a 50\u00a0kDa ceramic membrane until reaching a volume reduction factor of 3. The permeate produced presented an improvement of more than 30% in the ACE inhibitory activity. In contrast, the retentate was concentrated in larger and inactive peptides which led to a decrease of more than 80% in its inhibitory activity. The process suggested in this work was suitable to obtain a potent ACE inhibitory activity product able to be incorporated into food formulas intended to control or lower blood pressure. Moreover, the liquid product could be easily stabilised by spray dried if it would be necessary.",

Functionally, these monocytes revealed significantly increased adhesion and transmigration through endothelial monolayers. Overexpression of ACE in transfected monocytes or THP-1 cells led to development of more differentiated, macrophage-like phenotype with up-regulated expression of Arg1, MCSF, MCP-1 and CCR2. Expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFa and IL-6 were also noticeably up-regulated. ACE overexpression resulted in significantly increased adhesion and transmigration properties. Transcriptional screening of ACE-overexpressing monocytes revealed noticeably increased expression of Angiotensin II receptors and adhesion- as well as atherosclerosis-related ICAM-1 and VCAM1. Inhibition of monocyte ACE or AngII-receptor signalling led to decreased adhesion potential of ACE-overexpressing cells.",

Ambulatory treatment with hypotensors, mainly angiotensin-renin system inhibitors, can be associated in these patients with potassium retention and risk of hyperkalemia. In pre-dialysis stage-5 CKD patients, the use of medication accompanied by hyperkalemia increases risks of developing it. Using diuretics like spironolactone also increases this risk. Serum potassium can also increase in case of inappropriate consumption of potassium-rich food (bananas). Since ambulatory care does not always rigorously control hyperkalemia in CKD patients we consider it is useful to screen patients when they are referred to dialysis services. The screening can reflect the management of ambulatory CKD patients under treatment with ACE-I and ARB hypotensors.

    "979": "A best evidence topic in cardiac surgery was written according to a structured protocol. The question addressed was 'which patients should be on renin-angiotensin system blockers after coronary surgery?' Using the reported search, 12 papers represented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. The authors, journal, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes and results of these papers are tabulated. The 12 studies included 5 prospective randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 1 meta-analysis. One RCT of 2553 stable patients post-coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) with left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction \u226440% showed that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (ACEI) therapy can and probably should be delayed beyond 7 days due to increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality associated with immediate postoperative initiation of ACEI treatment. Another study showed that the cardioprotective benefits of ACEI following CABG are persistent with respect to an LV ejection fraction below or above 40% and whether percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or CABG was performed. A large multicentre international study of 4224 patients undergoing CABG looking at a composite outcome of rates of cardiac, cerebral and renal events and in-hospital mortality showed that continuous treatment with ACEI compared with no ACEI was associated with reductions of risks of non-fatal events (P = 0.009, odds ratio 0.69, 95% confidence interval 0.52-0.91). Addition of ACEI de novo following surgery was also associated with significant reduction in the risk of the composite outcome (P = 0.004) and of a cardiovascular event (P = 0.04). We conclude that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor treatment plays an important role in minimizing ischaemic events after CABG even in low-risk patients. The cardioprotective benefits of these drugs are persistent at mid- and long-term follow-up, with respect to LV ejection fraction below or above 40% and whether PCI or CABG was performed. Not only continuation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition early after surgery but also adding ACEI de novo postoperatively can be associated with better cardiovascular and renal outcomes.",

Bradykinin is the end-product of the kallikrein/kinin system, which has been recognized as an endogenous target for combating CNS inflammation. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors influence the kallikrein/kinin system and reportedly have immunomodulatory characteristics. The objectives of this study were to determine whether bradykinin is involved in the pathogenesis of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS, and whether bradykinin control by the ACE inhibitor could be a therapeutic target in MS. The ACE inhibitor enalapril (1\u00b70 or 0\u00b72\u2009mg/kg/day) was administered orally to EAE mice and the serum levels of bradykinin and cytokines in EAE mice were analysed. As a result, the administration of enalapril increased serum bradykinin levels, decreased the clinical and pathological severity of EAE and attenuated interleukin-17-positive cell invasion into the CNS. Additionally, bradykinin receptor antagonist administration reduced the favourable effects of enalapril. Our results suggest that bradykinin is involved in the pathomechanism underlying CNS inflammation in EAE, possibly through inhibiting cell migration into CNS. Control of the kallikrein/kinin system using ACE inhibitors could be a potential therapeutic strategy in MS.",

Chronic urticaria in particular is rarely due to allergy. Equally for angioedema, many will consider the exceptionally rare hereditary angioedema (HAE), but in fact other medical causes are the most likely, in particular the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) drugs. Approximately 3-5% of patients receiving ACE-I will develop angioedema at some time in the course of their treatment.1 Stress is a major contributor to both chronic urticaria and recurrent angioedema. Treatment needs to focus on the use of long-acting, non-sedating, antihistamines. Corticosteroids may be used acutely but not long term.",

We compared the obtained data with the effect of N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) (a nonselective NOS inhibitor) and L-N(G)-(1-iminoethyl)lysine (L-NIL) (a relatively selective inhibitor of iNOS activity) on cells in this model. To investigate the involvement of an exogenous NO on IL-12 and TNF-\u03b1 production we used NO donor-S-nitrosocaptopril (S-NO-Cap). The most potent inhibitor of NO generation was 1400\u2009W. This compound also markedly increased IL-12 p40 secretion and decreased TNF-\u03b1 release. L-NIL suppressed both NO and TNF-\u03b1 production, but it did not change IL-12 p40 synthesis. The effect of L-NMMA on NO generation was weaker than other inhibitors. Moreover, it decreased TNF-\u03b1 secretion slightly but not significantly. IL-12 p40 production by stimulated cells was inhibited by S-NO-Cap in a dose dependent manner, but no effect on TNF-\u03b1 release was observed. The potency and selectivity of 1400\u2009W as an inhibitor of iNOS and cytokine release modifier are encouraging for therapeutic use.", 
    "983": "Aspiration pneumonia is common in older people. To reduce the risk of aspiration pneumonia, maintenance of good oral hygiene is important and medications affecting salivary flow or causing sedation are best avoided, if possible. The use of H2 blockers and proton-pump inhibitors should be minimised. Different compensatory and facilitation techniques can be applied during oral feeding. Hand feeding should be tried before consideration of tube feeding. The use of tube feeding is the last resort and is mainly for improving nutrition and hydration. Prevention of aspiration pneumonia and increasing survival rates should not be the rationales for tube feeding. Feeding via both gastrostomy and nasogastric tube has similar risks for aspiration pneumonia, and continuous pump feeding is not better than intermittent feeding. Jejunal feeding might decrease the chance of aspiration pneumonia in selected high-risk patients. If older patients are on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors without intolerable cough, continuing the drug may be beneficial. Folate deficiency, if present, needs to be promptly corrected. Further better-designed studies are warranted to find the best ways for prevention of aspiration pneumonia.", 
    "984": "Heart Failure (HF) is a progressive and fatal disorder, which ranks among the major public health problems in Brazil and worldwide. However, survival for patients who developed the syndrome after myocardial infarction (MI) enhanced significantly, as a result of an improvement of pharmacological therapies. A medical breakthrough was the discovery that remodelling of the left ventricle (LV) may be limited by the blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), at the level of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and binding of angiotensin (Ang) II to its AT1 receptor. This review shows that the therapeutic effects of both ACE inhibitors and the angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) go beyond the interference in the biochemical pathway ACE-Ang II AT1-receptor. Such effects are also related to the potentiation of bradykinin and increased beneficial effects mediated by the AT2 receptor. Therefore, the results of five randomized trials were presented, which evaluated the use of losartan, valsartan or candesartan, considering their effects on survival and risk of clinical deterioration in patients with symptomatic HF after MI. These studies confirmed the advantage of ARBs over inhibitors in case of cough, rashes and angioneurotic edema, despite similar adverse effects, such as hyperkalemia, renal failure and hypotension. Thus, in this article we have discussed with patents that ACE inhibitors also appear as the first option as RAS inhibitors in search of relevant results for the patient, allowing the alternative use of ARBs to those patients with intolerance.",

We aimed to study the effectiveness of two consecutive sessions of cryosurgery for actinic keratosis and investigate factors associated with its therapeutic success. Hence, we conducted a longitudinal study including 92 patients of both sexes, aged 50-75 years with 5-50 actinic keratosis on the face and forearms, who underwent cryosurgery and treatment with sunscreen SPF 30, at baseline and after 120 days. The lesions were counted in duplicate by the same examiner before the start of treatment and after 120 (N=92) and 300 days (N=33), represented by their medians and quartiles and compared using the generalized linear mixed effects model (negative binomial). Treatment behavior was investigated in relation to sex, age, education, skin type, smoking, sun exposure at work and the use of aspirin, anti-inflammatory and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. There was a significant reduction in the actinic keratosis count on the face and forearms (p<0.05). Our results confirmed the effectiveness of cryosurgery for actinic keratosis, with a 57% reduction in the number, and size of the lesions. Higher education levels (p=0.02) and less sun exposure at work (p=0.02) independently promoted a significant reduction in the actinic keratosis count. Different population groups showed characteristic responses to the treatment, which may be explained by the degree of adherence to the use of photoprotection. In two sessions, cryosurgery with liquid nitrogen reduced the actinic keratosis count.",

Several common genetic variants of the CES1 and CES2 genes have been shown to influence drug metabolism and clinical outcomes. Polymorphisms of the CES1 gene have been reported to affect the metabolism of dabigatran etexilate, methylphenidate, oseltamivir, imidapril, and clopidogrel, whereas variants of the CES2 gene have been found to affect aspirin and irinotecan. Although the findings of these studies may be preliminary, they demonstrate the potential clinical utility of CES polymorphisms; however, more research is required, especially with respect to CES2. In this review, we outline the functional, molecular, and genetic properties of CES1 and CES2, and highlight recent studies that have shown relations between CES1 and CES2 variants and contemporary pharmacotherapy.",

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin receptor blockers have been considered effective at slowing the progression of kidney function deterioration. However, these drugs cannot sufficiently halt the progression of nephropathy to the extent that is required. A low-protein diet (LPD) is believed to be a nutritional intervention that may slow kidney disease progression. In fact, preclinical animal experiments have demonstrated excellent renoprotective effects of an LPD. However, in human clinical trials, analyses of the effects of protein restriction on diabetic nephropathy have not yet revealed consistently positive outcomes of this nutritional intervention. In this review, we analyze the potential renoprotective effects of an LPD on diabetic nephropathy and summarize the outcomes of clinical trials that have systematically investigated the efficacy of an LPD in diabetic nephropathy. In addition, we discuss some potential approaches associated with nutritional interventions to combat progressive kidney disease.",

Treatment of heart failure in diabetics is not substantially different from the treatment of heart failure in non-diabetic patients. It is based on ACE-inhibitors, beta-blockers and mineralocorticoid receptor blockers. In advanced heart failure the treatment with various devices reaches importance, for example biventricular pacing for cardiac resynchronization. Recently, it has been discussed the question of long-term cardiovascular safety of hypoglycaemic drugs. Older anti-diabetic agents such as insulin, metformin, and sulfonylurea are considered to be cardiovascular safe. However, rosiglitazone from thiazolidinedione class increases incidence of cardiovascular events, resulting in cancellation of its registration in Europe and its considerably limited use in the United States. Therefore, cardiovascular safety is tested very carefully in clinical trials in new anti-diabetic agents that affect incretin system. Recently, saxagliptin has shown to increase incidence of heart failure in diabetic patients.",

After the above analysis, 353 peptides were identified and the molecular biological functions of 239 proteins have been known. The identified molecular biological functions of these proteins mainly included binding activity, enzyme activity, transporter activity, inhibitor activity and so on. Five peptides were obtained after the screening and appropriate amino acid modification among the identified 353 peptides, according to the relationship between the sequence structure of the bioactivity peptide and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor activity. The five peptides were speculated to have ACE inhibitor activity and synthesized to detect ACE inhibitor activity. The results showed that all of the five peptides had good ACE inhibitor activity. The peptides of AELDIVLALF and LAVNLIPFP among the five peptides displayed especially good ACE inhibition with half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of (10.65 +/- 0.50) micromol/L and (23.66 +/- 1.08) micromol/L, respectively.

In the present study, we identified angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory peptides from Mactra veneriformis hydrolysate using a nano-LC-MS/MS method. Mactra veneriformis hydrolysate was first separated into four fractions (F1-F4) based on molecular weight by ultrafiltration. The fraction with molecular weight lower than 1 kDa (F1) showed the highest ACE inhibitory activity. F1 was then analyzed by a high throughput nano-LC-MS/MS method and sequences of peptides in F1 were calculated accordingly. The 27 peptides identified as above were chemically synthesized and tested for ACE-inhibitory activity. The hexapeptide VVCVPW showed the highest potency with an IC50 value of 4.07 \u03bcM. We then investigated the interaction mechanism between the six most potent peptides and ACE by molecular docking. Our docking results suggested that the ACE inhibitory peptides bind to ACE via interactions with His383, His387, and Glu411 residues. Particularly, similar to the thiol group of captopril, the cysteine thiol group of the most potent peptide VVCVPW may play a key role in the binding of this peptide to the ACE active site.",

The effects of the direct renin inhibitor aliskiren on microvascular structure were never previously evaluated. Therefore, we investigated the effects of aliskiren in comparison with those of an extensively used angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, ramipril, on peripheral subcutaneous small-resistance artery morphology, retinal arteriolar structure, and capillary density in a population of patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Sixteen patients with mild essential hypertension and with a previous diagnosis of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus were included in the study. Patients were then randomized to 1 of the 2 active treatments (aliskiren 150 mg once daily, n=9; or ramipril 5 mg once daily, n=7). Each patient underwent a biopsy of the subcutaneous fat from the gluteal region, an evaluation of retinal artery morphology (scanning laser Doppler flowmetry), and capillary density (capillaroscopy), at baseline and after 1 year of treatment. Subcutaneous small arteries were dissected and mounted on a pressurized micromyograph, and the media-to-lumen ratio was evaluated. A similar office blood pressure-lowering effect and a similar reduction of the wall-to-lumen ratio of retinal arterioles were observed with the 2 drugs. Aliskiren significantly reduced media-to-lumen ratio of subcutaneous small-resistance arteries, whereas ramipril-induced reduction of media to lumen ratio was not statistically significant. No relevant effect on capillary density was observed. In conclusion, treatment with aliskiren or ramipril was associated with a correction of microvascular structural alterations in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.",

MCF-7 cells were continuously exposed to 1 \u03bcmol/L TAM to develop TAM resistant cells (TAM-R). MTT cell viability assay was used to determine the growth response of MCF-7 and TAM-R cells, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to assess angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE), angiotensin II receptor type-1 and type-2 (AGTR1 and AGTR2) mRNA expressions. Preventive and therapeutic effects of RAS blockers - captopril and losartan - were examined on MCF-7 and TAM-R cells.

In this study, we characterized changes in hepatic copper concentrations and hepatic oxidative milieu, in rats with the metabolic syndrome and NAFLD as a result of FED with pharmacological manipulations to reduce blood pressure or plasma triglycerides. Changes in plasma and hepatic copper concentrations were correlated with changes observed in the immunohistochemical hepatic expression of copper-zinc-superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD; SOD1), metallothionein (MT) and nitrotyrosine (NITT). FED administration was associated with a 2.2-fold reduction in hepatic copper concentrations, a decrease in the hepatic SOD1 expression, disappearance of the hepatic MT expression and increase in the hepatic NITT expression. Bezafibrate administration restored the hepatic copper concentrations and the hepatic SOD1 expression to levels that were observed in the control rats. A significant positive correlation between hepatic copper concentrations and the values of hepatic SOD1 expression of each animal included in this study was found. Administration of either captopril or bezafibrate increased hepatic MT expression, however, to levels that were lower than those observed in the control group. Administration of either amlodipine, or captopril or bezafibrate to the FED rats, had no effect on hepatic NITT expression. NAFLD development in FED rats is associated with a decrease in hepatic copper concentrations that is associated with a decrease in the hepatic SOD1 expression. Bezafibrate administration increases hepatic copper concentrations and restores the hepatic SOD1 expression.",

We compared the effect of anticoagulant treatment, clopidogrel, salicylate, nitrate, beta-blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, statin and trimetazidine therapy on mortality in function of the type of myocardial infarction. There were no differences between mortality of patients with STEMI and NSTEMI with respect of use of heparine, salicylate, nitrate, beta-blocker, ACE inhibitor, statin and trimetazidine. While examining the effect of clopidogrel, we observed a significantly lower mortality rate in patients with NSTEMI compared to the STEMI group (p = 0.005). These differences are due to the known variability in clopidogrel absorption and metabolism, which could be influenced by the type of myocardial infarction.",

The composite response element (CoRE) region was identified in the promoter, whereas the presence of mature microRNA sequences improves the knowledge on the factors putatively involved in the gene regulation. A total of 46 polymorphic sites have been detected. The transition g.2126A>G falls within the TATA-box of dromedary CSN2 promoter with a putative influence on the transcription factor binding activity. The frequency of the G allele is 0.35 in a population of 180 she-camels belonging to 4 different ecotypes. In the same population, a conservative SNP (g.4175C>A) was found at the codon 7 of the signal peptide, whereas a comparative analysis with a cDNA sequence available in the database evidenced a missense SNP (g.4180T(Leu)>G(Arg)) at exon 2. Four SNPs were found in the bactrian camel. The SNP c.666G>A is responsible for the amino acid change Met(201)\u2192Ile and it represents the first missense allele at the \u03b2-casein in camels. Finally, five interspersed repeated elements were identified at intronic level, whereas the presence of putative bio-functional peptides belonging to ACE-inhibitor and anti-oxidative families confirms the potential protective role of the camel milk for the human nutrition.",

Serum concentrations of enalapril and enalaprilat were determined for pharmacokinetic analysis. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity, serum ureic nitrogen (SUN), creatinine and electrolytes were measured, and blood pressure was monitored for pharmacodynamic analysis. The elimination half-lives of enalapril and enalaprilat were 0.67 and 2.76\u2009h respectively after IV enalapril. Enalapril concentrations after PO administrations were below the limit of quantification (10\u2009ng/ml) in all horses and enalaprilat concentrations were below the limit of quantification in 4 of the 7 horses.

Yet overall incidence and pattern of DDIs in Iran has not been well documented and little information is available about the strategies that have been used for their prevention. The purpose of this study was to systematically review the literature on the incidence and pattern of DDIs in Iran as well as the used strategies for their prevention. PubMed, Scopus, electronic Persian databases, and Google Scholar were searched to identify published studies on DDIs in Iran. Additionally, the reference lists of all retrieved articles were reviewed to identify additional relevant articles. Eligible studies were those that analyzed original data on the incidence of DDIs in inpatient or outpatient settings in Iran. Articles about one specific DDI and drug interactions with herbs, diseases, and nutrients were excluded. The quality of included studies was assessed using quality assessment criteria. Database searches yielded 1053 potentially eligible citations. After removing duplicates, screening titles and abstracts, and reading full texts, 34 articles were found to be relevant. The quality assessment of the included studies showed a relatively poor quality. In terms of study setting, 18 and 16 studies have been conducted in inpatient and outpatient settings, respectively. All studies focused on potential DDIs while no study assessed actual DDIs. The median incidence of potential DDIs in outpatient settings was 8.5% per prescription while it was 19.2% in inpatient settings. The most indicated factor influencing DDIs incidence was patient age. The most involved drug classes in DDIs were beta blockers, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), diuretic agents, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Thirty-one studies were observational and three were experimental in which the strategies to reduce DDIs were applied. Although almost all studies concluded that the incidence of potential DDIs in Iran in both inpatient and outpatient settings was relatively high, there is still no evidence of the incidence of actual DDIs. More extensive research is needed to identify and minimize factors associated with incidence of DDIs, and to evaluate the effects of preventive interventions especially those that utilize information technology.", 
    "1040": "Antihypertensive drugs have been linked to new-onset atrial fibrillation (NAF); however, the way in which these drugs affect the development of NAF in hypertensive patients has not been thoroughly examined. Herein, we report a population-based study in which we investigated the relationship between antihypertensive drug therapy and the risk of NAF. The population sample consisted of 47\u2009682 hypertensive patients identified from claim forms provided to the central regional branch of the Bureau of National Health Insurance in Taiwan between January 2005 and December 2010. Prescriptions for antihypertensive drugs prescribed before the index date were retrieved from a prescription database. From these data, we estimated the hazard ratio (HR) of NAF associated with antihypertensive drug use; non-NAF subjects served as the reference group. After adjusting for age and sex, we observed that the risk of NAF was higher among the patients taking diuretics (HR, 1.39; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.06-1.82) compared with the patients not taking diuretics. Patients who took angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.65-0.97) showed a lower risk of developing NAF compared with the nonusers of ACE inhibitors. Angiotensin receptor blockers, alpha-blockers, beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers were not associated with a risk of NAF. The results of this study suggest that hypertensive patients who take diuretics have a significant increase in the risk of NAF, whereas patients who take ACE inhibitors are at lower risk of NAF.",

We examined the relationship between blood pressure (BP) and vascular function in SV from 94 male patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Patients were pretreated with respect to cholesterol (3.4\u00b11.2 mmol/L) and BP (systolic 139\u00b122 mmHg, diastolic 74\u00b113 mmHg). All patients were taking aspirin, 85% statins, 50% angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and 70% beta-blockers. We demonstrate in human SV rings ex vivo that increased BP has no effect on acetylcholine-mediated vasodilatation (p=0.58), nor on the constrictor response to L-NMMA (p=0.98), but has a positive association with the constrictor response to phenylephrine (p=0.008) and a negative correlation with the vasodilator response to sodium nitroprusside (p=0.03).

    "1072": "Metabolic syndrome (Mets), including diabetes and hypertension, increases the risk of colorectal cancer via the induction of chronic inflammation, acceleration of oxidative stress, and activation of the renin-angiotensin system. The present study examined the possible inhibitory effects of captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and antihypertensive drug, on the development of azoxymethane (AOM)-induced colonic premalignant lesions, aberrant crypt foci (ACF), in SHRSP.Z-Lepr(fa) /IzmDmcr (SHRSP-ZF) diabetic and hypertensive rats. Male 6-week-old SHRSP-ZF rats were administered two, weekly intraperitoneal injections of AOM (20 mg/kg body weight). Following the second injection, the rats received drinking water containing captopril (8 mg/kg/day) for two weeks. At sacrifice, captopril administration significantly lowered the blood pressure and reduced the total number and size of ACF compared with those observed in the untreated group. The serum levels of angiotensin-II and the expression levels of ACE and angiotensin-II type 1 receptor mRNA on the colonic mucosa decreased following captopril treatment. Captopril also reduced the urinary 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine levels and the serum derivatives of reactive oxygen metabolites levels, both of which are oxidative stress markers, but increased the mRNA levels of catalase, an antioxidant enzyme, in the colonic epithelium. Moreover, the expression levels of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin-18, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, inducible nitric oxide synthase, vascular endothelial growth factor and proliferating cell nuclear antigen mRNA in the colonic epithelium were decreased significantly following captopril administration. These observations suggested that captopril prevents the development of ACF by inhibiting renin-angiotensin system activation and attenuating inflammation and oxidative stress in SHRSP-ZF rats. Therefore, targeting Mets-related pathophysiological conditions, including renin-angiotensin system activation, may be an effective strategy to prevent colorectal carcinogenesis in patients with Mets, particularly those with hypertension.", 
    "1073": "Hepatic uptake and efflux transporters govern the systemic and hepatic exposure of many drugs and metabolites. Enalapril is a pharmacologically inactive prodrug of enalaprilat. Following oral administration, enalapril is converted to enalaprilat in hepatocytes and undergoes translocation into the systemic circulation to exert its pharmacologic effect by inhibiting angiotensin-converting enzyme. Although the transport proteins governing hepatic uptake of enalapril and the biliary excretion of enalapril and enalaprilat are well established, it remains unknown how hepatically derived enalaprilat translocates across the basolateral membrane into the systemic circulation. In this study, the role of ATP-binding cassette transporters in the hepatic basolateral efflux of enalaprilat was investigated using membrane vesicles. ATP-dependent uptake of enalaprilat into vesicles expressing multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) 4 was significantly greater (\u223c3.8-fold) than in control vesicles. In contrast, enalaprilat was not transported to a significant extent by MRP3, and enalapril was not transported by either MRP3 or MRP4. The functional importance of MRP4 in the basolateral excretion of derived enalaprilat was evaluated using a novel basolateral efflux protocol developed in human sandwich-cultured hepatocytes. Under normal culture conditions, the mean intrinsic basolateral efflux clearance (CLint ,basolateral) of enalaprilat was 0.026 \u00b1 0.012 \u00b5l/min; enalaprilat CLint,basolateral was significantly reduced to 0.009 \u00b1 0.009 \u00b5l/min by pretreatment with the pan-MRP inhibitor MK-571. Results suggest that hepatically derived enalaprilat is excreted across the hepatic basolateral membrane by MRP4. Changes in MRP4-mediated basolateral efflux may alter the systemic concentrations of this active metabolite, and potentially the efficacy of enalapril.", 
    "1074": "Not all hypertensive patients respond well to ACE inhibition. Here we determined whether renin-angiotensin system (RAS) phenotyping, i.e., the measurement of renin or ACE, can predict the individual response to RAS blockade, either chronically (enalapril vs. enalapril\u2009+\u2009candesartan) or acutely (enalapril\u2009\u00b1\u2009hydrochlorothiazide, HCT).", 
    "1075": "Chronic enalapril\u2009+\u2009candesartan induced larger renin rises, but did not lower blood pressure (BP) more than enalapril. Similar observations were made for enalapril\u2009+\u2009HCT vs. enalapril when given acutely. Baseline renin predicted the peak changes in BP chronically, but not acutely. Baseline ACE levels had no predictive value. Yet, after acute drug intake, the degree of ACE inhibition, like \u0394renin, did correlate with \u0394BP. Only the relationship with \u0394renin remained significant after chronic RAS blockade. Thus, a high degree of ACE inhibition and a steep renin rise associate with larger acute responses to enalapril. However, variation was large, ranging >50\u00a0mm Hg for a given degree of ACE inhibition or \u0394renin. The same was true for the relationships between \u0394renin and \u0394BP, and between baseline renin and the maximum reduction in BP in the chronic study.", 
    "1076": "Our data do not support that RAS phenotyping will help to predict the individual BP response to RAS blockade. Notably, these conclusions were reached in a carefully characterized, homogenous population, and when taking into account the known fluctuations in renin that relate to gender, age, ethnicity, salt intake and diuretic treatment, it seems unlikely that a cut-off renin level can be defined that has predictive value.", 
    "1077": "Most patients with essential hypertension do not exhibit substantial renal damage. Renal autoregulation by preventing glomerular transmission of systemic pressures has been postulated to mediate this resistance. Conversely, malignant nephrosclerosis (MN) has been postulated to develop when severe hypertension exceeds a critical ceiling. If the concept is valid, even modest blood pressure (BP) reductions to below this threshold regardless of antihypertensive class (1) should prevent MN and (2) lead to the healing of the already developed MN lesions. Both predicates were tested using BP radiotelemetry in the stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats receiving 1% NaCl as drinking fluid for 4 weeks. Severe hypertension (final 2 weeks average systolic BP, >200 mm Hg) and MN (histological damage score 36\u00b15; n=27) developed in the untreated stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats but were prevented by all antihypertensive classes (enalapril [n=15], amlodipine [n=13], or a hydralazine/hydrochlorothiazide combination [n=15]) if the final 2-week systolic BP remained <190 mm Hg. More impressively, modest systolic BP reductions to 160 to 180 mm Hg (hydralazine/hydrochlorothiazide regimen) initiated at \u22484 weeks in additional untreated rats after MN had already developed (injury score 35\u00b14 in the right kidney removed before therapy) led to a striking resolution of the vascular and glomerular MN injury over 2 to 3 weeks (post-therapy left kidney injury score 9\u00b12, P<0.0001; n=27). Proteinuria also declined rapidly from 122\u00b19.5 mg/24 hours before therapy to 20.5\u00b13.6 mg 1 week later. These data clearly demonstrate the barotrauma-mediated pathogenesis of MN and the striking capacity for spontaneous and rapid repair of hypertensive kidney damage if new injury is prevented.", 
    "1078": "Adiponectin is the most abundant peptide secreted by adipocytes, being a key component in the interrelationship between adiposity, insulin resistance and inflammation. Central obesity accompanied by insulin resistance is a key factor in the development of metabolic syndrome (MS) and future macrovascular complications. Moreover, the remarkable correlation between coronary artery disease (CAD) and alterations in glucose metabolism has raised the likelihood that atherosclerosis and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) may share a common biological background. We summarize here the current knowledge about the influence of adiponectin on insulin sensitivity and endothelial function, discussing its forthcoming prospects and potential role as a therapeutic target for MS, T2DM, and cardiovascular disease. Adiponectin is present in the circulation as a dimer, trimer or protein complex of high molecular weight hexamers, >400 kDa. AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 are its major receptors in vivo mediating the metabolic actions. Adiponectin stimulates phosphorylation and AMP (adenosin mono phosphate) kinase activation, exerting direct effects on vascular endothelium, diminishing the inflammatory response to mechanical injury and enhancing endothelium protection in cases of apolipoprotein E deficiency. Hypoadiponectinemia is consistently associated with obesity, MS, atherosclerosis, CAD, T2DM. Lifestyle correction helps to favorably modify plasma adiponectin levels. Low adiponectinemia in obese patients is raised via continued weight loss programs in both diabetic and nondiabetic individuals and is also accompanied by reductions in pro-inflammatory factors. Diet modifications, like intake of fish, omega-3 supplementation, adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern and coffee consumption also increase adiponectin levels. Antidiabetic and cardiovascular pharmacological agents, like glitazones, glimepiride, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers are also able to improve adiponectin concentration. Fibric acid derivatives, like bezafibrate and fenofibrate, have been reported to enhance adiponectin levels as well. T-cadherin, a membrane-associated adiponectin-binding protein lacking intracellular domain seems to be a main mediator of the antiatherogenic adiponectin actions. The finding of novel pharmacologic agents proficient to improve adiponectin plasma levels should be target of exhaustive research. Interesting future approaches could be the development of adiponectin-targeted drugs chemically designed to induce the activaton of its receptors and/or postreceptor signaling pathways, or the development of specific adiponectin agonists.",

This study describes recent outpatient heart-failure management in the United States. We analyzed data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey of 2006-2008, a multistage random sampling of non-Federal physician offices and hospital outpatient departments. Annually, 1.7% of all outpatient visits were for heart failure (51% females and 77% non-Hispanic whites; mean age, 73 \u00b1 0.5 yr). Typical comorbidities were hypertension (62%), hyperlipidemia (36%), diabetes mellitus (35%), and ischemic heart disease (29%). Body weight and blood pressure were recorded in about 80% of visits, and health education was given in about 40%. The percentage of patients taking \u03b2-blockers was 38%; the percentage taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (ACEI/ARBs) was 32%. Medication usage did not differ significantly by race or sex. In multivariate-adjusted logistic regression models, a visit to a cardiologist, hypertension, heart failure as a primary reason for the visit, and a visit duration longer than 15 minutes were positively associated with ACEI/ARB use; and a visit to a cardiologist, heart failure as a primary reason for the visit, the presence of ischemic heart disease, and visit duration longer than 15 minutes were positively associated with \u03b2-blocker use. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was negatively associated with \u03b2-blocker use. Approximately 1% of heart-failure visits resulted in hospitalization. In outpatient heart-failure management, gaps that might warrant attention include suboptimal health education and low usage rates of medications, specifically ACEI/ARBs and \u03b2-blockers.",

The method was validated to demonstrate the specificity, lower limit of quantitation, accuracy and precision of measurements. The validated LC-MS-MS method has been successfully applied to study the pharmacokinetics of zofenopril calcium in healthy Chinese volunteers."
