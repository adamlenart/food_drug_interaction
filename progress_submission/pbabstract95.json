    "0": "A multicentre study was undertaken to determine whether side effects induced by hypotensive drugs could be reduced by replacement with low dose captopril. There were 100 patients on combinations of drugs, including diuretics, beta-blocking agents, methyldopa, clonidine and vasodilators. A questionnarie to obtain information on quality of life was completed by the patients. Each patient had major drugs, possibly responsible for side effects, withdrawn. Captopril was added at an initial dose of 12.5 up to 25 mg b.i.d. and titrated to a maximum of 50 mg t.i.d., until the blood pressure was equal to or lower than the level on entry into the study. Blood pressure was measured every two weeks and questionnaries were completed a number of times during the treatment period and scored at random, not in chronological order. A marked drop in blood pressure was obtained: mean systolic blood pressure went down from 173.4 +/- 2 to 154.5 +/- 2 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure dropped from 104.5 +/- 11 to 9l.5 +/- 12 mm Hg. Neither tachycardia nor orthostasis was observed. Side effects, including inability to concentrate, nightmares, dizziness and sexual dysfunction, were reduced in 36% of the patients. Captopril itself produced no significant additional adverse reactions. It is concluded that captopril is a safe and effective drug, which can replace antihypertensive drugs that have deleterious side effects.", 
    "1": "In order to assess the effect of captopril on bronchial reactivity, 16 consecutive patients with asthma and hypertension were randomized in a double-blind crossover study, with increasing doses of placebo or captopril for 4 week periods. Forced expiratory flow (FEV1) and a dose-response curve with methacholine (PD20) were measured before and after treatment . Effective control of hypertension was achieved in all patients on captopril (P less than 0.05), while no changes in FEV1 and PD20 were observed. We conclude that captopril can be used as a first step in the treatment of asthmatic patients with hypertension.", 
    "2": "Approximately 80% of the hydrolysis of [leu]enkephalin in rat plasma can be attributed to bestatin-sensitive aminopeptidase activity, and an additional 5% is due to angiotensin converting enzyme. Thiorphan-sensitive enkephalinase hydrolysis of [leu]enkephalin could not be detected in plasma. On the other hand, 2-d-ala-l-[leu]enkephalin is metabolized approximately 35% by an unidentified bestatin-sensitive enzyme and approximately 15% by thiorphan-sensitive enkephalinase in rat plasma, while captopril-sensitive angiotensin converting enzyme is without measurable activity against this substrate.", 
    "3": "To determine the role of the kallikrein-kinin (KK) system in patients with diabetes mellitus in relation to nephropathy and/or hypertension, the single-dose effects of captopril (25 mg, p.o.) were examined in 9 control subjects and 32 diabetics (group 1; 11 normotensives without nephropathy, group 2;10 hypertensives without nephropathy, group 3; 11 hypertensives with nephropathy). Significant hypotensive effects of captopril were found in groups 1 and 2 as well as in the control group, but not in group 3. These hypotensive effects were completely blocked by the infusion of ethyl-p-(6-guanidinohexanoyloxy) benzoate methanesulfonate (FOY), a kallikrein inhibitor. The administration of captopril during vehicle infusion induced a significant elevation of plasma renin activity (PRA) at 60 and 120 min after captopril in each group, except for group 3. FOY cancelled these captopril-induced effects on PRA in those groups. No correlation was found between pretreatment PRA and the changes in mean blood pressure (MBP) after captopril during vehicle infusion in whole diabetics. In addition, the daily urinary excretion of kallikrein in group 3 was significantly lower than that in groups 1 and 2 as well as in the control group. These results suggest that the hypotensive action of captopril in diabetics without nephropathy may be largely due to activating the KK system, and that the KK system may be suppressed in hypertensive diabetics with nephropathy.", 
    "4": "Psychiatric patients presenting with chronic psychogenic polydipsia are often difficult to treat with standard psychiatric interventions. Pharmacologic intervention was attempted in three patients and was successful in one. One patient had a significant and sustained reduction of water intake while on 160 mg of propranolol. One patient did not improve with either propranolol or captopril while a third patient showed no improvement of serum sodium with demeclocycline nor reduction of water intake with propranolol. The potential mechanisms by which these pharmacologic agents might alter thirst in patients with primary polydipsia are discussed.", 
    "5": "In dogs with maximal subpression of endogenous angiotensin II (AII) production due to a high-salt diet and converting enzyme inhibition (CEI, SQ 14,225, 15 micrograms X kg-1 X min-1 i.v.), infusion of a subpressor dose of angiotensin II (1 ng X kg-1 X min-1) did not change contralateral kidney function. In the infused kidney, a decrease in renal blood (RBF) by 24% and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by 9% with an increase in filtration fraction (FF) by 20% occurred. Similarly, the increase in single nephron (SN) RBF was greater than in SNGFR, thus rising SNFF by 8%. Glomerular capillary pressure (GCP) did not change significantly; a decrease by 20% in proximal tubule pressure thus resulted in an increase in delta HP by 22%. This increase counterbalanced the profound drop in ultrafiltration coefficient (Kf) (57%) making the decrease in GFR and SNGFR relatively small. Total arteriolar resistance (RT) rose by 26%, the rise being due mainly to an increase in efferent (RE, 50%) rather than afferent (RA, 4%) resistance. If the AII infusion was carried out during concomitant infusion of CEI and indomethacin (1 mg X kg-1 X min-1) or aspirin (5 mg X kg-1 X min-1), RBF decreased by 36%, GFR by 25%, thus increasing FF by 18%; corresponding SN values underwent similar changes. Drop in Kf amounted to 62% and hydraulic pressure difference (delta HP) increased by 11% with unchanged GCP. The increase in RT (72%) was now due to a very similar increase in both RA (68%) and RE (76%). In conclusion, a very small dose of AII exhibits-at least in superficial nephrons-a typical preferential efferent effect which disappears after inhibition of prostanoid synthesis, indicating a protective effect of vasodilatory prostaglandins mainly on the afferent arteriole.", 
    "6": "We describe a new principle for measuring concentrations of pharmacologically active captopril or other angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in blood. Serum is incubated with 125-I-labeled ACE inhibitor (substance 351A, a lisinopril analogue, Merck Sharp & Dohme) in a nonequilibrated system, in which label and ACE inhibitor compete for binding to added serum ACE. Free label is separated by adsorption to coated charcoal. Concentration of captopril or other ACE inhibitor is calculated from a standard curve. Results in healthy volunteers showed rapid absorption of captopril with maximal concentration of active drug within 1 h, and fast disappearance within 2.5 h. Stability of captopril was improved by immediate 1:100 dilution of blood samples with assay buffer. In spite of this precaution, analysis should be performed within two days to avoid loss of active drug due to polymerization and protein binding. Samples of other tested ACE inhibitors can be frozen and later analyzed at convenience. The new principle is simple, sensitive, and specific.", 
    "7": "The antihypertensive and hormonal effects of a new ACE-inhibitor, lisinopril (MK-521), was studied in 11 patients with renal arterial stenosis (bilateral in 1). Oral doses exceeding 5 mg a day significantly reduced blood pressure (BP), the maximum fall occurring 6 h after taking the drug. At higher doses (20-80 mg/day) sustained antihypertensive effects persisted for 24 h. Lisinopril was equally effective in lowering supine and standing BP. When the drug was given stepwise in increasing doses, (5, 10, 20, 40, and in 5 cases 80 mg/day) the BP was successively normalized in 10 of 11 patients (supine BP less than 90 mmHg). 3 patients with low renin hypertension (LRH) responded less well to monotherapy on long-term treatment with lisinopril than the others. A significant increase in heart rate was observed, initially and after 1 month of treatment. After 5 days treatment with increasing doses the plasma concentrations of angiotensin II (AII) and aldosterone (Aldo) fell significantly to very low concentrations. However, on long term treatment (3 months) suppression of AII and Aldo did not always take place. A concomitant decrease in 24 h urinary aldosterone excretion occurred. No changes in renal function or other biochemical tests except for a slight increase in S-K were observed. There were no adverse side-effects. We conclude that lisinopril is an effective and safe medication for renovascular hypertension.", 
    "8": "In patients with moderate to severe CHF, enalapril improves symptoms and is well tolerated. It increases functional capacity in the form of exercise time and reduces the left ventricular dimensions. Enalapril also has favourable effects on electrolytes and, although it increases renal blood flow, it reduces the glomerular filtration rate.", 
    "9": "The pharmacokinetics of the converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril were studied in an open, randomised, balanced crossover design in 12 hospitalised patients with stable, chronic congestive heart failure (CHF). Enalapril maleate is a prodrug requiring in vivo hepatic esterolysis to yield the active diacid inhibitor enalaprilat. CHF results in changes in regional blood flow that may affect the gastrointestinal absorption, hepatic hydrolysis and renal excretion of enalapril and enalaprilat. In order to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of enalapril in CHF, the following treatments were given: enalapril 10 mg orally, enalapril 5 mg intravenously and enalaprilat 5 mg intravenously. Each dose was followed by a 72-hour period with frequent blood sampling and fractionated urine collection for the radioimmunoassay of both enalapril and enalaprilat. Mean absorption for the oral dose was 69%, hydrolysis 55%, bioavailability 38%, urinary recovery 77% and estimated first-pass effect 10%. The results were compared with available data in normal subjects. After oral administration of 10 mg enalapril, the extent of absorption, the degree of hydrolysis and the bioavailability in CHF patients appear to be similar to those in normal subjects, with differences less than 10%. The rates of absorption and hydrolysis appear to be slightly slower in CHF. The serum concentrations of enalaprilat were consistently greater in CHF, and maximal concentrations were reached at 6 hours in CHF compared with 4 hours in normal subjects. The maximal hypotensive responses were similar for all three treatments, although the onset of action was rapid following intravenous enalaprilat. It is concluded that the presence of CHF does not appreciably alter the pharmacokinetic behaviour of enalapril.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "10": "The central role of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in the regulation of fluid balance and haemodynamics was not fully appreciated until the discovery and clinical application of inhibitors of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Captopril, the first orally active compound has proved to be highly effective in mild, intermediate and severe hypertension and in congestive heart failure. This is also true for enalapril, the first of the second generation (non-sulfhydryl) of ACE inhibitors. Both compounds combine a high degree of clinical efficacy with a low rate of side effects, and both are eliminated via renal excretion. Thus, reduced doses are required in renal failure. Captopril has a shorter half-life and requires more frequent dosing than enalapril. Whether long-acting ACE inhibitors carry distinct advantages or disadvantages compared with short-acting ones is not clear, but both possibilities must be considered. Among many new ACE inhibitors being developed, compounds eliminated via hepatic routes, such as fosfenopril and zofenopril, may prove advantageous in renal failure. Very long-acting ones, such as lisinopril, a potent ACE inhibitor already shown to be clinically effective, may add value to this group of therapeutic agents. Drug compliance may be easily tested by measuring ACE activity in serum from patients treated with stable ACE inhibitors, such as enalapril and lisinopril, which is an obvious advantage compared with other antihypertensive compounds. The presence of ACE in sites not associated with regulation of fluid balance or blood pressure, such as macrophages and reproductive organs, and the possibility that new functions of ACE may be discovered, call for vigilance regarding possible long term side effects of ACE inhibitors.", 
    "11": "In 12 patients with essential hypertension who remained hypertensive despite chronic chlorthalidone treatment, the effect of 2 weeks of additional therapy with the converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI) enalapril on blood pressure and body fluid volumes has been evaluated. The objective was to examine the influence of a diuretic-stimulated renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) on haemodynamics and body fluid volume. Mean arterial pressure (MAP -21%), total peripheral resistance index (TPRI -22%) and plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC -39%) were decreased, and plasma renin activity (PRA 660%) was increased. The average heart rate (HR), cardiac index (CI), plasma volume (PV), blood volume (BV), extracellular fluid volume (ECFV) and body weight (BW) remained unchanged. A negative correlation was found between the per cent changes in ECFV and PAC. Thus, body fluid volumes during chronic diuretic treatment are well preserved even when the RAAS with its sodium retaining properties is suppressed by CEI. Possible mechanisms are a volume (not angiotensin II) - dependent stimulation of aldosterone and a fall in blood pressure.", 
    "12": "The therapeutic profile of enalapril in mild to moderate uncomplicated essential hypertension was assessed in 265 patients who participated in a multicenter, open-label, prospective study lasting eight weeks. There were 54 younger (aged 39 years or less), 136 middle-aged (40 to 59 years), and 75 older patients (60 years or over). Monotherapy with enalapril in a single daily dosage regimen ranging between 5 and 40 mg resulted in normotension (in the sitting position) in 73% of the younger, 50% of the middle-aged, and 56% of the older patients. Normotension was achieved with 5 mg/day of enalapril in 41%, 18%, and 37% of the subgroups, respectively. Both systolic and diastolic pressures at the end of eight weeks of treatment were significantly lower (P less than 0.01) in the younger patients than in the other two age groups. White patients had significantly greater (P less than 0.001) response of both systolic and diastolic blood pressures than did black patients and required significantly smaller (P less than 0.01) average daily dosages of enalapril (14 mg versus 22 mg, respectively). The overall incidence of side effects was 14% among all 276 patients enrolled in the study. Most were mild and transient, but six patients discontinued enalapril during the first week of therapy because of side effects. There were no cases of rash, dysgeusia, hematological disorders, or deterioration in renal function, but there were two cases of pruritus, one of glossitis associated with an upper respiratory infection, and three of dry cough or wheezing. Angioedema was not observed. Monotherapy with enalapril, usually in a single daily dose of 10 to 20 mg, was effective in inducing normotension in approximately half of the middle-aged and older hypertensive individuals and in nearly three fourths of those below age 40. In this study it was generally well tolerated, with a relatively small incidence of side effects.", 
    "13": "Infusion of bradykinin (1 microgram/min) or saline vehicle for 30 minutes into alloxan-diabetic rats produced no change in the very high levels of blood glucose. Furthermore, intravenous injection of captopril (3 mg/Kg body weight) into the diabetic rats did not result in a significant change of glucose concentrations over a period of 60 minutes. However, infusion of bradykinin 15 minutes after intravenous injection of captopril resulted in a marked decrease of glucose levels (p less than 0.01, compared to pretreatment) by 20 minutes after the start of the infusion. Thus, the captopril potentiated the effect of the kinin, possibly by inhibition of kininase II. Using a spectrophotometric assay with Bz-Gly-Gly-Gly as substrate insulin was shown to be an inhibitor of kininase II purified from hog lungs with an I50 of 1.6 X 10(-5)M compared to captopril with I50 of 2.2 X 10(-9)M. Furthermore, it was found that in vivo infusion of as little as 50 mU insulin over a period of 30 minutes, a dose that by itself was ineffective, potentiated the glucose-lowering activity of a bradykinin infusion in alloxanized rats. Interestingly, the infusion of insulin 15 minutes after injection of captopril, at doses of each compound which alone were inactive, did produce a significant fall (p less than 0.005) in glucose concentrations. Overall, the results show that captopril, insulin and bradykinin can interact to promote a reduction in blood glucose of alloxan-diabetic rats.", 
    "14": "In order to investigate the relationship between the kallikrein-kinin (K-K) system and renin-angiotensin (R-A) system, plasma kinin (pKIN), plasma angiotensin II (pAII), plasma renin activity (PRA) and angiotensin converting enzyme activity (ACEA) were determined in 19 essential hypertensives (EHT). pKIN and pATII measurements were performed by highly sensitive radioimmunoassay (RIA), both of which were established in our laboratory. The assay sensitivity of pKIN and pAII were 0.5 pg/tube and 0.1 pg/tube, respectively. In pKIN RIA, pKIN was extracted by ethanol from 0.8 ml of plasma obtained with a syringe containing kinin generating and destroying enzyme inhibitors. In pAII RIA, pAII was measured directly in small amounts of 50-100 microliter, unextracted plasma samples. The level in pAII was significantly higher (p less than 0.05) in the normal renin group (NRH: n = 13) as compared with low renin group of EHT (LRH: n = 6). However, no significant difference was found in pKIN and ACEA between these two groups. Although a significantly positive correlation was observed between pAII and PRA (p less than 0.001) in EHT, the ratio of pAII/PRA tended to be higher in LHR than in NRH. ACEA correlated positively with pAII (p less than 0.01) or PRA (p less than 0.02), respectively. On the other hand, a significant negative correlation was also found between pKIN and pAII (p less than 0.05). From these findings, it was assumed that there was a closed relationship between R-A and K-K systems, and that angiotensin converting enzyme (kininase II) might play some role in the interrelation between both systems.", 
    "15": "\"Enkephalinase\", a peptidase capable of degradating enkephalins, has been recently characterized in man, in both plasma and cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF). This study was designed to evaluate the ability of putative \"enkephalinase\" inhibitors, D-phenylalanine, captopril and thiorphan to decrease \"enkephalinase\" activity (EKA) in plasma and CSF in human sufferers. All drugs studied decreased plasma EKA. Captopril and thiorphan also decreased CSF EKA. Of the three drugs tested thiorphan proved to be the most potent \"enkephalinase\" inhibitor in both plasma and CSF. These results show the usefulness of EKA assessment as a procedure for evaluating the potency and specificity of putative \"enkephalinase\" inhibitors in man.", 
    "16": "Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) from rat testes and lung was purified to homogeneity and partially characterized with respect to physicochemical parameters. Additionally, the biological regulation of testicular ACE by gonadotropins and androgens was investigated was investigated and the cell type with which ACE is associated in testes was identified. Rat testicular ACE is a lower molecular weight, isozymic version of the lung enzyme. Partial proteolysis of each isozyme produces different peptide maps, suggesting unique primary structures for each protein. The sensitivity of each isozyme to Co2+, chelators and thermal denaturation is different, a finding that further supports the hypothesis that structural differences exist between the two isozymes. The pituitary gland is essential for the development during puberty and maintenance during adulthood of testicular ACE. In hypophysectomized mature rats, gonadotropins or androgen can maintain ACE activity to near sham-operated levels. ACE activity in testes appears to be associated almost entirely with various stages of germinal cell development. The function(s) of testicular ACE awaits definition. The mechanism of androgen-maintenance of testicular ACE is unclear. Whether androgen specifically induces gene expression of testicular ACE or simply allows for ACE activity to develop in parallel with spermatogenesis is an unresolved question.", 
    "17": "The investigations were carried out with partially purified angiotensin converting enzyme (E.C.3.4.15.1) from human seminal plasma and from human blood plasma. The Km-constants for angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) from both sources, estimated by the use of synthetic substrates, were in the same order. The catalytic properties of the enzymes were characterized by a series of known peptidase inhibitors. The male antifertility drug gossypol (1,1',6,6',7,7'-hexahydroxy-3,3'-dimethyl-5,5'-bis-isopropyl-(2,2' -naphthalene)--8,8'-dicarboxaldehyde) was identified as a potent ACE-inhibitor. The inhibitory constants of several kinins and other biologically active peptides were determined. Any regulatory influence of the peptides investigated on the ACE-activity in vivo is not probably. The inhibitor of Zn-containing metalloproteases 2-(N-hydroxycarboxamido)-4-methylpentanoyl-L-alanylglycin e amide) (Zinkov) selectively inhibited ACE from blood plasma, whereas ACE from seminal plasma was not influenced. In seminal plasma the majority of the enzyme is associated with macromolecular structures, identified as membrane vesicles. These vesicles contain also other enzymatic activities usually detectable in seminal plasma. In the male genital tract ACE is synthesized in the prostate, epididymis and testis. As our data indicate ACE seems not to be involved in the regulation of sperm motility.", 
    "18": "The activity of kininase II in crude human sperm was measured continuously by measuring the hydrolysis of a blocked tripeptide 3-(2-furylacryloyl)-L- phenylalanyl-glycyl-glycine (1 mmol/l). Mean seminal plasma activity was 335 +/- 61 U/g protein; the Km was 0.7 mmol/l; pH optimum was 8.8 in a 50 mmol/l HEPES buffer and the chloride optimum was 300 mmol/l. This male genital tract enzyme is inhibited by several kininase II inhibitors. Captopril (SQ 14225) showed IC50 = 1.6 X 10(-8) mol/l, with a competitive pattern (Ki = 7.3 X 10(-9)). 3-(Mercaptomethyl)-oxo-piperidineacetic acid showed the same kind of inhibition with an IC50 = 1.8 X 10(-6) mol/l (Ki = 6.8 X 10(-7) mol/l). Enalapril diacid was the most potent inhibitor and had an IC50 of 4.1 X 10(-9) mol/l and showed a mixed competitive and non-competitive inhibition (Ki = 10(-9) mol/Ki' = 9.5 X 10(-10) mol/l). These in vitro inhibition data suggest that, in vivo, such drugs may effect the function of kininase II in the male reproductive system. The observed 50% inhibition constants are comparable to those observed in lung enzyme suggesting similar kinetic properties.", 
    "19": "We present two methods for calculating Ki values of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, such as captopril, in anesthetized or conscious rabbits. Both methods are based on indicator-dilution type determinations of single pass transpulmonary metabolism of the ACE substrate benzoyl-phe-ala-pro (BPAP). The first method involves two determinations of Michaelis-Menten constants Km and Amax (product of Vmax and lung capillary plasma volume) of endothelial-bound ACE for BPAP. Thirty seconds before the second determination of kinetic constants, the inhibitor is administered iv (e.g. captopril, 12 nmol/kg). Comparisons of the apparent Km and Amax values, obtained after the inhibitor to the control values obtained from the first determination, provide Ki values. With the second method, the ratio Amax/Km is obtained, under first-order reaction conditions, before and 30 sec after administration of inhibitor. These apparent and control ratios are used to calculate Ki values. In both methods, plasma levels of the inhibitor at the time of the determination of apparent kinetic constants are estimated by injecting radio-labelled inhibitor (e.g. 3H-captopril), analyzing radioactivity in arterial samples and correcting for plasma protein binding. These methods are potentially applicable to the clinical evaluation of new ACE inhibitors, in vivo, under normal or pathologic conditions.", 
    "20": "Bradykinin (BK) is widely believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of anaphylaxis. To help clarify any such roles, we examined for effects of inhibitors of kininase II (angiotensin converting enzyme, ACE) and \"kininase I\" (carboxypeptidase N, CPN), on the early course of egg albumin-induced aggregate anaphylaxis in anesthetized guinea pigs. In this model, pulmonary and systemic arterial blood pressure (BP) rise (unless pulmonary fibrillation occurs), lung wgt increases by approximately 60% and pulmonary microvessels are occluded by cell-rich thrombi, all within 5 min of i.v. antigen. The 30 min mortality rate is approximately 2%. ACE inhibitors (BPP9a, Captopril and MK 422; doses up to 140 mumol/kg) do not make anaphylaxis more nor less severe in terms discernible by changes in BP, lung wgt, EKG or intravascular coagulation. In marked contrast, an inhibitor of CPN (2-mercaptomethyl-3-guanidinoethylthiopropionic acid, 2-MGP; 8-16 mumol/kg) increases the 30 min mortality rate to 94% and lung wgt to 180% of control. The animals die in ventricular fibrillation. Given the enormous BK potentiating effects of BPP9a, Captopril and MK 422, it seems likely that little if any BK is formed in the early min of anaphylaxis. 2-MGP does not potentiate BP effects of BK but markedly potentiates effects of C3a anaphylatoxin. Thus, our data support the views that BK is neither a primary nor secondary mediator of aggregate anaphylaxis, and the adverse effects of 2-MGP are best explained in terms of preservation of anaphylatoxins and not in terms of preservation of kinins.", 
    "21": "Six [3H]benzoyl-tripeptides were prepared and tested as substrates for angiotensin converting enzyme. Each was prepared first as its [4-iodo]-benzoyl-analog, and an atom of 3H per molecule was introduced by catalytic dehalogenation in 3H2-gas. Kinetic parameters were measured at 37 degrees C using as buffer 0.05 M Hepes, pH 8.0 containing 0.1 M NaCl and 0.6 M Na2SO4. When the substrates were used at concentrations far below their respective Km values, fractional rates of substrate utilization per unit time for constant enzyme concentration were direct function of respective second order rate constants (Kc/Km). Although absolute values of Kc/Km differed for human enzyme as opposed to rabbit enzyme, relative values of Kc/Km were virtually identical. Similarly, relative rates of substrates utilization during passage through lungs of anesthetized rats were similar to relative values of Kc/Km measured in vitro. Thus, there is now a range of ACE substrates usable, in vitro and in vivo, under conditions of first order enzyme kinetics, conditions under which values of V/Km and Ki can be measured directly.", 
    "22": "We have found that apparent Ki values of some, but not all, carboxyalkyl-dipeptide inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme decrease as a function of incubation time. The most potent of the ACE inhibitors tested so far is RAC-X-65 (N-[1(S)-carboxy-3-carboxanilidiopropyl]-L-Ala-L-Pro). When RAC-X-65 is not preincubated with human serum ACE (2.4 X 10(-11) M), the apparent Ki value is 4.4 X 10(-10) M. Preincubation of RAC-X-65 with ACE for 15 min before addition of substrate yields an apparent Ki of 4.1 X 10(-11) M. a 90 min preincubation of the inhibitor with ACE yields an apparent Ki of 1.2 X 10(-11) M, i.e., the reaction of the inhibitor with enzyme is virtually stoichiometric. The enzyme:inhibitor complex is poorly separated by molecular sieve chromatography or by dilution. That such tightly bound complexes are formed in vivo is suggested by the following results: The intravenous ED50 (anesthetized rats) of RAC-X-65 is 9.43 nmol/kg, and the time for half recovery (t1/2) of responsiveness to i.v. angiotensin I, 120 ng/kg, following a cumulative dose of 240 nmol/kg of the inhibitor is 165 min. For comparison, the i.v. ED50 of captopril is 105 nmol/kg, and its t1/2 following a cumulative dose of 240 nmol/kg is 16 min. Implied is the possibility that slow tight binding inhibitors of ACE may be used in a 1 pill per day regimen for the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "23": "Heretofore, carboxyalkyl peptide inhibitors of kininase II (e.g. N-[1-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl]-Ala-Pro, \"enalaprilic acid\") have been synthesized by means that yield racemic product. Typically, the secondary amine bond is formed by reacting an amino acid or dipeptide with a 2-keto carboxylic acid ester or imide. The group providing the 2-keto function must be used in excess, and the desired S,S,S isomer must be obtained by resolution procedures. We have developed a procedure whereby enalaprilic acid, RAC-X-64 and related compounds are synthesized stereospecifically and in relatively high yields.", 
    "24": "Acute left ventricular failure was induced in anesthetized dogs by left coronary embolization. Treatment with the converting enzyme inhibitor enalaprilat (MK-422) was then given. Hemodynamic registrations confirmed the development of left ventricular failure. Plasma concentrations of angiotensin II and aldosterone rose significantly. Treatment with enalaprilat was accompanied by significant reductions in heart preload and afterload and in plasma hormone concentrations.", 
    "25": "Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of captopril were studied in 5 continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients (including 2 hypertensive patients) after single oral administration of 50 mg captopril. The pharmacokinetic parameters for plasma free unchanged captopril were time to maximal concentration 1.1 +/- 0.3 h, maximal plasma concentration 387 +/- 75 ng X ml-1, elimination half-life 1.0 +/- 0.3 h, and the area under the concentration-time curve 711 +/- 144 ng X h X ml-1. For plasma total captopril (the sum of free unchanged captopril and its disulfide compounds) the values were time to maximal concentration 3.5 +/- 0.6 h and maximal plasma concentration 2,777 +/- 429 ng X ml-1. Captopril was detected in the dialysis fluid in all CAPD patients. Blood pressures in the 2 hypertensive CAPD patients were lower at 24 h after than before captopril administration. These results suggest that captopril may be eliminated by CAPD. In addition, there is a possibility that the antihypertensive effects of captopril may be prolonged in hypertensive CAPD patients.", 
    "26": "We investigated the effects of inhibition of angiotensin II (ANG II) formation with an ANG I converting enzyme inhibitor, namely Enalapril, on circulating levels of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). Seven normal volunteers received a low sodium diet in order to stimulate the renin-angiotensin system (period I). Subsequently, subjects maintained their low dietary sodium intake and received Enalapril perorally (period II). Each study period lasted for 6 days. Results indicated that subjects maintained a low dietary sodium intake with expected changes of the renin system before and during ANG I converting enzyme inhibition. Enalapril elicited a substantial fall in circulating ANP levels in six of the seven subjects studied. The causes of this change will have to be established but may possibly relate to hemodynamic consequences of Enalapril.", 
    "27": "This study investigates the acute haemodynamic effects of Quinapril (CI-906) a new non-sulphydryl angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor in 15 patients with refractory congestive cardiac failure. There were 14 males and 1 female mean age 59.5 years. After administration of Quinapril there was a significant reduction in mean arterial pressure (MAP) from 93.1 to 79 mmHg, systemic vascular resistance (SVR) from 1887 to 1349 dyn s cm-5 and PCW from 27.3 to 15.3 mmHg. This was accompanied by an increase in CO from 3.7 to 4.71/min, cardiac index (CI) from 1.97 to 2.51/min/m2 and Stroke volume index from 21.1 to 28.7 ml/m2. There was no significant change in heart rate (HR), right atrial pressure (RAP), or pulmonary vascular resistance. The peak effect on pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCW) and cardiac output (CO) occurred at 75-120 min after Quinapril administration. The maximum effect on mean arterial pressure (MAP) occurred slightly later at 120-150 min. SVR and CI exhibited 2 periods of peak effects, at 90 and 180 min. This time course is very similar to that observed in studies on the acute effects of Captopril. The significant improvement in haemodynamic measurements acutely, following administration of Quinapril 5 mg orally, suggests that this drug is worthy of further study in the management of patients with refractory congestive cardiac failure, in particular its long term effects.", 
    "28": "With orally active angiotensin converting inhibitors it is now possible to block the renin-angiotensin system chronically. These agents given alone normalize blood pressure of many hypertensive patients. In the remaining, an additional salt subtraction, induced for example by diuretics, is necessary to further reduce blood pressure. In patients with congestive heart failure, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors increase cardiac output and exercise capacity, both acutely and chronically. Adverse reactions resulting from blockade of the renin-angiotensin system can be predicted to a large extent and therefore are most often easily avoided. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors like captopril and enalapril, because of their efficacy and good acceptability are likely to become important drugs for the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure.", 
    "29": "In chronic congestive heart failure, there is stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, in addition to other homeostatic mechanisms. In addition to increased tone in the arteriolar and venous beds, there is salt and water retention by the kidney and excitation of the central nervous system by angiotensin. Interference with the generation of angiotensin reduces preload and afterload without a reflex tachycardia as the effects of angiotensin on the central nervous system are reduced. ACE inhibition is, therefore, a logical approach to the management of chronic congestive heart failure.", 
    "30": "Although it has been recognized that enalapril lowers blood pressure by reducing the total peripheral vascular resistance, its direct effect on blood vessels is largely unknown. Little information is available about the influence of enalapril on the different vascular regions. Ten patients with moderate essential hypertension were treated with enalapril 20 mg daily in a double-blind, placebo controlled cross-over study for six weeks during each period. Blood pressure and heart rate were measured in supine, sitting and standing position. Venous capacity was derived from pressure volume curves plotted simultaneously at forearm and calf. Arterial blood flow at rest and during reactive hyperemia was measured at calf and finger by plethysmography. Enalapril increases venous capacity in upper and lower limbs in patients with moderate essential hypertension. Also, there is vasodilation of calf and finger arteries both at rest and during reactive hyperemia. Finger and calf arteries contribute to the decrease of the total peripheral vascular resistance during treatment with enalapril; thus, ACE inhibition is capable of correcting the increased peripheral resistance which often is the main cause of arterial hypertension.", 
    "31": "Enalapril is a new angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor which, when absorbed by the digestive tract, is converted to enalaprilat. This metabolite is, in fact, the active form of enalapril. Its duration of action is sufficiently long so that enalapril can be administered in a single daily dose. Enalapril has been proved to be a highly effective therapeutic agent which is well tolerated by patients with arterial hypertension or severe congestive heart failure.", 
    "32": "Although the therapeutic usefulness of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in patients with hypertension and congestive heart failure has been clearly demonstrated, important unanswered questions remain about these drugs, including patient selection criteria, side effects, long-term effects, and especially their precise mechanism of action. The principal explanation of the effect of ACE inhibitors remains the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). However, in chronic treatment with ACE-inhibitory drugs, this relationship may not held true. Additional mechanisms of action postulated to explain the effect of ACE-inhibitors include inhibition of angiotensin II formation in the central RAS, neutralization of renin activity in the vascular wall, blockade of vasoconstrictor response to sympathetic nerve stimulation, and possible involvement of prostaglandins linked, for instance, to bradykinin accumulation. The search for additional mechanisms of action should lead to clinically important findings, provide a better understanding of the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease, and improve patient treatment with ACE inhibitory drugs.", 
    "33": "Peripheral glucose metabolism was studied during the influence of elevated systemic kinin levels by either application of exogenous bradykinin (BK) or inhibition of endogenous kinin degradation by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI). In infusion experiments in streptozotocin-diabetic rats, both BK (0.3 micrograms/min) and ACEI (300 micrograms captopril/100 g) showed a significant reduction of elevated blood glucose levels. In man, non-insulin dependent diabetics (NIDD) and healthy subjects in postoperative (POP) stress were examined. Peripheral insulin-sensitivity and muscular glucose balance were determined using the glucose clamp technique and the forearm technique. In NIDD as well as in POP subjects, impaired peripheral insulin responsiveness, as evaluated by whole body glucose consumption, was improved up to 50% by application of BK (80 micrograms/h i.v.) or ACEI (25 mg captopril p.o.), respectively. This was most probably due to accelerated muscular glucose uptake which was assessed in the same experiment and found to be increased 2- to 3-fold under these conditions. As a molecular basis for the observed effects on muscular glucose uptake, phosphofructokinase was found to be markedly stimulated by BK (8 X 10(-10)mol/l) in the isolated perfused rat heart, suggesting accelerated glycolytic flux. It may be concluded that ACEI increase muscular insulin responsiveness, thus being beneficial in insulin-resistant states as well as in hypertension. This metabolic effect is most probably due to elevated systemic kinin levels. Further investigations are required to evaluate the clinical relevance of these findings.", 
    "34": "The effects of captopril have been studied in 19 patients suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In 9 of these patients with pulmonary hypertension (mean pulmonary artery pressure greater than 20 mm Hg), we studied the effects of the drug on pulmonary haemodynamics, blood gases and systemic circulation. Haemodynamic data were recorded before oral captopril 50 mg and for the next 60 minutes. Following captopril administration, significant reductions in mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) (P less than 0.05), in mean pulmonary wedge pressure (PWP) (P less than 0.05) and in total pulmonary resistance (TPR) were noted; significant reductions in mean brachial artery pressure (BAP) and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) were also recorded, while cardiac output, heart rate and blood gas tensions showed no significant changes. Furthermore, the higher the hypoxaemia was, the greater the reduction in BAP (P less than 0.05). In the other 10 COPD patients with moderate essential hypertension, captopril was given as monotherapy (75-10 mg/day) for 60 days. We found no significant modification of the various respiratory function tests except for an increase in the vital capacity (P less than 0.05). Systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure were reduced both in the supine and in the standing position and there were no side effects, in particular no bronchospasm even in the patients responsive to bronchodilator drugs. Our data suggest that captopril is an effective and safe drug when administered to COPD patients with essential hypertension. Moreover, in these patients, it may protect the pulmonary circulation from hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction.", 
    "35": "Although converting-enzyme inhibition is of established value in the management of patients with severe chronic congestive heart failure, troublesome adverse reactions occur frequently during the course of treatment and may cause physicians to interrupt effective therapy. The three most common adverse reactions that are seen in patients with heart failure following treatment with captopril and enalapril (symptomatic hypotension, functional renal insufficiency, hyperkalaemia) are predictable consequences of interfering with the homeostatic functions of the renin-angiotensin system, which evolved millions of years ago to preserve life in sodium-depleted states. It is not surprising, therefore, that these untoward effects can be prevented or reversed by increasing the dietary intake of salt or reducing the dose of concomitantly administered diuretics; their occurrence rarely requires discontinuation of drug therapy. Recognition of this link between sodium balance and the adverse effects of converting-enzyme inhibition is important, because most patients with severe heart failure who experience such untoward reactions can nevertheless be expected to improve clinically during long-term therapy, if effective treatment is not interrupted.", 
    "36": "Nifedipine, in a slow release preparation, was given at a mean daily dosage of 47 +/- 4 mg to 12 patients with severe hypertension in whom arterial pressure was not satisfactorily controlled (mean blood pressure, 172 +/- 6/111 +/- 4 mmHg) by the association of a converting enzyme inhibitor and a diuretic. Nifedipine administration induced a marked decrease in blood pressure (to 133 +/- 3/85 +/- 3 mmHg), serum potassium and plasma aldosterone. Following adequate control of hypertension and because of severe hypokalaemia in some patients, the diuretic was discontinued in 10 subjects. After 1.7 +/- 0.5 months of treatment by the converting enzyme inhibitor and nifedipine, no change in arterial pressure occurred whilst serum potassium returned to normal in most patients. These results demonstrate that nifedipine may be useful in patients with residual elevation of arterial pressure when treated by converting enzyme inhibitor and diuretic. However, in such patients serum potassium level should be carefully monitored. In addition, our observations suggest that calcium blockers may be an effective alternative to diuretics in patients receiving a converting enzyme inhibitor.", 
    "37": "The effects of a prolonged treatment with prolactin on the morphology and hormone secretion of adrenal zona glomerulosa of gonadectomized testosterone-replaced rats were investigated by coupled morphometric and radioimmunologic techniques. The dexamethasone/captopril-induced atrophy of zona glomerulosa cells (-42%) and fall in the blood level of aldosterone (-37%) were partially counteracted by chronic prolactin administration: the values had increased by about 15% and 17%, respectively, but remained lower than in the control animals. The prolonged treatment with prolactin of dexamethasone/captopril-administered ACTH/angiotensin II-replaced rats provoked a striking increase in the zona glomerulosa cell volume (24%) and in the blood level of aldosterone (33%) above the control values. The possibility is discussed whether prolactin may be directly involved in the stimulation of the growth and steroidogenic capacity of rat zona glomerulosa, without interacting with the gonads and interfering with the hypothalamo-hypophyseal axis and the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "38": "The time course of the blood pressure lowering effect and the dose-response relationship of the new angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril (HOE 498) were studied in 8 patients, with essential hypertension. As compared with placebo, a single oral dose of 2.5 mg ramipril lowered systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The antihypertensive action of single oral doses of 5, 7.5 and 10 mg ramipril was more pronounced. No change in heart rate occurred. Angiotensin converting enzyme activity was suppressed after all doses of ramipril studied. Plasma renin activity increased after 2.5 mg and 5 mg ramipril. Plasma aldosterone was not affected by 2.5 mg, but it fell after 5 mg ramipril. Thus, ramipril produced prolonged inhibition (more than 12 hours) of angiotensin converting enzyme activity and lowered blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension.", 
    "39": "The non-sulfhydryl converting enzyme inhibitor Ramipril (HOE 498) is characterized by long lasting antihypertensive activity in man. To examine its cardiovascular potential in heart failure, ramipril was administered during acute ischemic left ventricular failure in pentobarbital anesthetized dogs, induced by repeated injections of plastic microspheres into the left main coronary artery. Repeated embolizations produced stable left ventricular (LV) pump failure characterized by LV enddiastolic pressure of 22 mmHg, reductions in LV dp/dt max and cardiac output. Blood pressure and heart rate were not changed while total peripheral resistance increased. After a stabilization period ramipril was administered in two doses at 30 or 100 micrograms/kg as an intravenous bolus followed by continuous infusion of 3 or 10 micrograms/kg/min for 150 min. Ramipril in the lower dose decreased LV enddiastolic pressure by 8 mmHg, mean pulmonary artery pressure by 4 mmHg, systemic blood pressure by 40 mmHg and total peripheral resistance by 1280 dyn x sec x cm-5. LV dp/dt max, heart rate and cardiac output remained unchanged during ramipril administration. More pronounced effects were obtained with the higher dose. In conclusion, the improvements of hemodynamics produced by ramipril during acute ischemic left ventricular failure in anesthetized dogs are best explained by a reduction in both preload and afterload.", 
    "40": "Thirty-nine hypertensive patients were entered into a randomized, double-blind protocol to assess the effects of enalapril (10-20 mg b.i.d.), or combined enalapril (10-20 mg b.i.d.) and hydrochlorothiazide (25-50 mg b.i.d.) therapy on renal function and hemodynamics. Enalapril, either alone or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide, effectively controlled blood pressure. In patients with an initial inulin clearance less than or equal to 80 ml/min/1.73 m2, inulin and p-aminohippurate clearances were markedly improved toward normal following either drug therapy. The filtration fraction was either unchanged (monotherapy) or increased (combination therapy), suggesting a direct glomerular effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition. Renal vascular resistance was decreased in all patients. These observations suggest that enalapril, either alone or in combination with a diuretic, has the potential to reverse renal function abnormalities encountered in the hypertensive state.", 
    "41": "This prospective, double-blind, multicenter study compared enalapril plus hydrochlorothiazide with standard triple therapy (STT; hydrochlorothiazide, timolol, and hydralazine) with regard to safety, tolerability, antihypertensive efficacy, and effect on renal function in 75 patients with documented renovascular hypertension. Both groups showed a significant mean decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure during the double-blind study, with the enalapril group showing a mean 12 mm greater decrease in systolic blood pressure as compared to STT (less than 0.05). Effective treatment of diastolic hypertension was noted in 96% of the enalapril group as compared to 82% on STT (p less than 0.05). STT failure was seen exclusively in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis of high grade and frequently in association with impaired renal function. cPAH, a measure of effective renal plasma flow, showed a significant increase in the enalapril group, as compared to the STT (p less than 0.05). In contrast, there was a bimodal response of CIn (GFR): 80% of patients in the enalapril group showed no significant change while 20% (10 patients) showed a mean decrease of 28% along with a 12% increase in CPAH (p less than 0.01). No acute renal failure or toxic side effects were noted in the enalapril group. Enalapril plus hydrochlorothiazide is very effective in treating renovascular hypertension and is without significant toxic side effects. The self-limited increase in serum creatinine seen in 20% of renovascular hypertensive patients receiving enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide may identify a subset of patients with unilateral or bilateral high grade renal artery stenosis who should be treated with angioplasty or operative intervention.", 
    "42": "All four factors which theoretically may affect the renal vein renin ratio in unilateral renal artery stenosis--increased renin secretion and diminished renal plasma flow on the stenotic side; suppressed renin secretion and renin extraction on the contralateral side--have been assessed. In a series of patients with unilateral renal artery stenosis, the renal vein ratio of active renin was more closely related to the reduction of renal plasma flow than to renin secretion rate on the affected side. On the contralateral side renin secretion was suppressed while angiotensin II was extracted. During long-term treatment with the converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril, peripheral plasma angiotensin II was lowered, while active renin concentration was markedly elevated, both in arterial plasma and in renal venous plasma of the stenotic kidney; the contralateral kidney became a net extractor of active renin. Thus, all 4 factors which theoretically affect the renal vein renin ratio can operate clinically. Both before and during enalapril, the affected kidney secreted inactive renin.", 
    "43": "Increased sympathetic activity occurs in congestive heart failure and may have deleterious effects. To examine the effects of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition on sympathetic activity in heart failure, the noradrenaline response to exercise was measured in 18 patients given enalapril or placebo in double-blind trial. The plasma noradrenaline response to graded exercise was significantly reduced after 4 weeks on active treatment but was unchanged by placebo treatment. The rate-pressure product at maximal exercise was significantly reduced after 4 weeks in the enalapril group but unchanged in the placebo group. These results suggest that ACE inhibition reduces sympathetic activity in patients with heart failure.", 
    "44": "The efficacy of enalapril, a new angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, was investigated in a double-blind placebo-controlled study in 24 patients with chronic heart failure. The patients belonging to NYHA functional class II-IV and treated with digoxin and diuretics were randomized to enalapril (12 patients) or placebo (12 patients) treatment for a 12-week period. Assessments were carried out at baseline and at 4 and 12 weeks during the treatment period. Complete data could be obtained on 10 patients receiving enalapril and on 11 patients receiving placebo. NYHA functional class improved by at least one class in 6 of 10 patients in the enalapril group, but only in 1 of 11 patients in the placebo group (chi 2 = 6.54; p less than 0.05). Duration of bicycle ergometer exercise increased significantly in the enalapril group from 8.8 +/- 3.4 to 11.3 +/- 4.2 (4 weeks) and to 11.2 +/- 3.6 min (12 weeks; p less than 0.05 for both), whereas it remained unchanged in the placebo group. Left ventricular ejection fraction by radionuclide ventriculography in the enalapril group increased significantly (baseline: 33.5 +/- 19.9%, 4 weeks: 40.0 +/- 20.0% (p less than 0.001), 12 weeks: 39.6 +/- 20.1% (p less than 0.01], whereas in the placebo group it did not change significantly from the baseline of 48.8 +/- 16.7%. The results indicate that enalapril induces a sustained relief of symptoms and improves exercise capacity in patients with heart failure. This subjective improvement appears to be accompanied by an increase in ejection fraction.", 
    "45": "Sixteen patients with an established diagnosis of renovascular hypertension were entered in an open study of enalapril (MK421), an oral angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, for treatment of their hypertension. Initial blood pressure was 178.9 +/- 6.3/106.2 +/- 3.1 mm Hg during conventional therapy on a median of 3 different antihypertensive agents. All antihypertensive therapy was ceased and the patients admitted to hospital. Following introduction of enalapril, blood pressure fell to 161.5 +/- 6.9/90.6 +/- 4.1 mm Hg at 24 h (p less than 0.01 systolic and diastolic). Blood pressure control (diastolic blood pressure, phase V, less than 95 mm Hg) was achieved with monotherapy in 7 patients and in a further 5 patients with addition of a diuretic. Renal function was compromised in 4 patients, requiring cessation of enalapril in 2 instances. Enalapril is an oral ACE inhibitor useful in the treatment of renovascular hypertension. Close monitoring of renal function is necessary during the introduction of enalapril therapy in patients with renovascular hypertension.", 
    "46": "CHF may activate the RAS by various mechanisms. Acute CHF is associated with high PRA, whereas chronic, stable disease is combined with normal values. The response to ACEI is affected by blood pressure, degree of activation of the RAS, salt balance and degree of possible renal failure. It may also be affected by concomitant diuretic or, e.g., digoxin therapy. ACEI improves RPF, GFR may remain normal or may increase, if it was previously impaired due to reduced RPF. Severe hypotension in combination with decreased autoregulatory capacity may decrease GFR. Generally, renal excretion of sodium and water increase. These changes in renal handling of salt and water are primarily caused by decreased AII. They are also augmented by inhibited sympathetic tone and thirst and decreased release of ADH and aldosterone. Increased synthesis of vasodilating and natriuretic PGs is probably also of some importance. Dilutional hyponatremia may be corrected by combined ACE inhibitor and furosemide treatment. Water and sodium excretion increase and sodium is redistributed from the intracellular space. Low serum sodium values increase and azotemia may be corrected, if ACE inhibitor doses are carefully titrated to avoid severe hypotension. These effects are ascribed mainly to a decrease of AII, thirst and ADH release. The effect of furosemide is improved since increased amounts of salt are delivered to the loop of Henle and access of furosemide to its site of action is facilitated by increased RPF. ACEI does not cause any obvious negative effects on renal handling of salt and water.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "47": "During development of heart failure there are marked changes in the peripheral circulation. The renal and splanchnic circulations are reduced early. The cerebral circulation is maintained by autoregulation. Skeletal muscle blood flow is reduced in relation to the decrease of cardiac output. There are also important metabolic changes in these muscles with reduced mechanical efficiency. Treatment with arterial vasodilators increase cardiac output. However, most of this increase is usually shunted, probably in the splanchnic circulation. If any, only small increases in muscle blood flow have been reported. ACE-inhibition has been shown to have beneficial acute effects on the renal, cerebral and skeletal muscle blood flow with improved flow in these areas. This treatment seems to be the most beneficial vasodilatory alternative available so far.", 
    "48": "The acute and long-term efficacy, tolerance and safety of two orally active angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, captopril (C) and enalapril (E) were compared in patients on regular haemodialysis (RHD). C and E were successively administered for 6 months to 8 RHD patients with hypertension unresponsive to fluid withdrawal and conventional antihypertensive therapy. The fall in blood pressure after a starting dose of 25 mg C or 5 mg E was of the same magnitude. It was not correlated with the initial PRA levels, which were normal in all patients. The mean daily dose of ACE inhibitor was 45 +/- 28 mg during the C period and 19.4 +/- 17.6 mg at the end of the E period. Three patients required additional treatment, comprising beta-blockers and/or calcium antagonists. The individual daily dose of ACE inhibitor, the need for additional treatment and the antihypertensive response achieved were highly correlated during both study periods. During C administration 4 out of 8 patients presented a taste disturbance, which disappeared 2 weeks after substituting E for C. Serum electrolytes, liver enzymes, haemoglobin concentration and white cell and platelet counts remained unchanged throughout both study periods. It is concluded that RHD patients with hypertension are responsive to ACE inhibitors, C and E being equally effective.", 
    "49": "Systemic administration of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) to non-deprived rats increased saline (0.9%) consumption (5-HT hyperdipsia), without altering saline preference in two-bottle test. When sodium saccharin (0.1%) was the test solution 5-HT suppressed both consumption and preference. 5-HT saline hyperdipsia was blocked by pretreatment with an angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor (MK421) and mimicked by isoprenaline-induced stimulation of renin production; saccharin consumption and preference were unaffected by either drug. However, methysergide (a 5-HT antagonist) attenuated the effects of 5-HT on saccharin consumption and preference, thus confirming that these effects are mediated via peripheral 5-HT receptors. It is suggested that the effects of 5-HT on saline consumption are mediated via stimulation of the renin-angiotensin system, but its effects on saccharin consumption and preference are mediated by a separate mechanism at some point subsequent to peripheral 5-HT receptors.", 
    "50": "The effect of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, perindopril, on autonomic function was assessed in a double blind, placebo controlled, crossover study in 10 normotensive males. Eight milligram of perindopril given orally lowered blood pressure without a change in heart rate. Perindopril enhanced the vagally mediated heart rate variation with deep breathing. There was no impairment of the responses to either bicycle exercise at 175 W for 5 min or isometric handgrip. The pressor response to cold was not changed and the response to the Valsalva manoeuvre was unaltered. These results suggest that the absence of tachycardia after perindopril may be in part related, as has been reported with other converting enzyme inhibitors, to enhanced cardiac parasympathetic tone. Vagomimetic action may be a property of converting enzyme inhibitors in general.", 
    "51": "Aldosterone suppression is said to play a major role in the long term hypotensive efficacy of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. However, in previous reports from other laboratories, plasma volume has been found mostly increased and sodium balance sometimes positive. The effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril (10-40 mg/day, p.o., for 6 weeks) on blood pressure, body fluid volumes, renal function and plasma aldosterone were compared to those of hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg/day, p.o.) alone for 2 weeks and in association with propranolol (80-160 mg/day, p.o.) for 4 more weeks during a randomized double-blind parallel study in 14 essential hypertensives. Hydrochlorothiazide alone and in combination with propranolol induced slight and not significant change in either blood pressure and body fluids. The maximum hypotensive response to enalapril was achieved only after 2 weeks of continuous treatment possibly because after 1 week the hypotensive efficacy was lessened by a significant (P less than 0.05) fluid retention secondary to a transient and not significant fall in renal perfusion. At this time aldosterone was not significantly changed compared to pretreatment values. After 6 weeks on enalapril, blood pressure was significantly reduced, plasma aldosterone further but not significantly decreased and extracellular fluid volume was normal. These findings indicate that aldosterone suppression contributes to the blood pressure lowering effect of enalapril by offsetting the salt and water retention observed on starting treatment and due to direct vasodilation.", 
    "52": "The development of proteinuria, and more rarely nephrotic syndrome, has been seen with the use of the first orally active converting-enzyme inhibitor captopril. Both of these side effects appear to occur more frequently when the drug is used at higher dose, particularly in the presence of renal impairment. We have used enalapril, a new orally active converting-enzyme inhibitor in the treatment of a patient with drug-resistant hypertension and renal impairment who previously developed nephrotic syndrome with captopril. Recurrence of the nephrotic syndrome was not seen in this patient during a period of 20 months on enalapril. On the contrary, urinary protein excretion over the same period was reduced to around 1 g in 24 hours. Our experience would suggest that enalapril may usefully be substituted for captopril in the treatment of hypertensive patients in whom the latter has caused proteinuria or nephrotic syndrome.", 
    "53": "Autoregulatory efficiency of renal blood flow (RBF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was evaluated in 12 anesthetized dogs that had been maintained on low-sodium diet during control conditions and following infusion of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (captopril). Converting enzyme inhibition (CEI) decreased systemic blood pressure by 15.5 +/- 3.5%, increased RBF by 36.3 +/- 6.5%, and increased GFR by 25.9 +/- 10.7%. In response to reductions in renal arterial pressure, RBF was efficiently autoregulated and did not change significantly until the 89- to 75-mm Hg range during the control period and the 74- to 54-mm Hg range during CEI. Overall GFR autoregulatory efficiency was generally well maintained during CEI; however, evaluation of the coupled autoregulatory efficiency of RBF and GFR indicated that during angiotensin blockade, there was a greater incidence of a dissociation between RBF and GFR autoregulatory efficiency. Six of the 12 dogs showed reduced GFR autoregulatory efficiency at renal arterial pressures where RBF was still well maintained. Thus, while the data indicate that blockade of the renin-angiotensin system does not abolish the basic capability of the kidney to autoregulate either RBF or GFR efficiently, more subtle influences on the coupling of RBF and GFR autoregulatory efficiency were observed at the lower level of the autoregulatory range.", 
    "54": "In 40 patients with essential hypertension, enalapril was compared with propranolol as an antihypertensive agent in a double-blind study. The patients were randomly given either enalapril 5-10-20 mg bid or propranolol 40-80-120 mg bid in a treatment consisting of step-by-step increases in dosage. When the diastolic blood pressure remained greater than 90 mm Hg on the highest dosage, hydrochlorothiazide was added. Both enalapril and propranolol reduced blood pressure, although the patients tended to achieve lower blood pressures while on enalapril. More patients on propranolol required additional diuretic therapy than patients on enalapril. Propranolol reduced heart rate; with enalapril there were no changes in heart rate. Both drugs increased serum potassium and urea. Plasma renin substrate was reduced by enalapril, but raised by propranolol. Enalapril increased plasma renin activity and angiotensin I, while propranolol reduced both. Converting enzyme activity was lowered with enalapril but was unchanged with propranolol. Both drugs reduced angiotensin II. Plasma aldosterone concentration was more suppressed with propranolol than with enalapril.", 
    "55": "Bradykinin and 22 of its analogs were evaluated for their abilities to inhibit the hydrolysis of [3H]hippurylglycylglycine by purified porcine kidney angiotensin I converting enzyme. The mean inhibitory concentration (IC50) for bradykinin was 1.2 +/- 0.2 X 10(-6) M. Except for Ile-Ser-bradykinin and [Sar4]-bradykinin, none of the kinin analogs were more potent in this regard than bradykinin. Bacitracin, gamma-aminobutyric acid, epsilon-aminocaproic acid, and structurally related compounds were also tested. The IC50 value for bacitracin was 1.9 +/- 0.4 X 10(-4) M, gamma-aminobutyric acid, 83.4 +/- 7.2 mM, and for epsilon-aminocaproic acid, 7.0 +/- 1.4 mM. Compounds were also evaluated for their abilities to prevent 125I-labelled [Tyr1]-kallidin binding to angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibited by EDTA. The IC50 values for bradykinin, bacitracin, gamma-aminobutyric acid, and epsilon-aminocaproic acid were 1.6 +/- 0.3 X 10(-8) M, 2.6 +/- 0.9 X 10(-6) M, greater than 291 mM, and 13.2 +/- 3.9 mM, respectively.", 
    "56": "Perfusion of carbogen gas through the lumen of the rat caudal artery abolished the dilator response to acetylcholine (1 mumol 1(-1) in artery segments which had been precontracted with noradrenaline (50 nmol 1(-1]. Hence, it was assumed that gas perfusion was effective in removing the vascular endothelium. Angiotensin I (30 nmol 1(-1] and angiotensin II (10 nmol 1(-1] enhanced the responses of artery segments to field stimulation of their sympathetic nerves (0.5 Hz, 10 s). In arteries with an intact endothelium the ability of each peptide to enhance responses to stimulation was the same whether applied through the lumen or to the adventitial surface. Removal of the endothelium, by gas perfusion, did not significantly alter the facilitatory effects of extraluminally or intraluminally applied angiotensin I or angiotensin II. The converting enzyme inhibitor enalaprilat was equally effective in inhibiting the facilitatory effect of angiotensin I in the presence and absence of an intact endothelium. It is concluded that in the rat caudal artery, conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II does not depend on an intact endothelium and that the facilitatory effect of angiotensin II on noradrenergic neuroeffector transmission is not modified by, or dependent on, an intact endothelium.", 
    "57": "The effects of 1-[(S)-3-acetylthio-2-methylpropanoyl]-L-prolyl-L-phenylalanine (alacepril, DU-1219), an orally active angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, on humoral factors which participated in the blood pressure control were examined with various experimental animals. In conscious renal hypertensive dogs, alacepril (3 mg/kg p.o.) showed decreases in plasma ACE activity and plasma aldosterone concentration, and increases in plasma renin activity and plasma angiotensin I concentration accompanied by a significant reduction in blood pressure. In conscious normotensive dogs, alacepril (1 and 3 mg/kg p.o.) showed an increase in urinary excretion of bradykinin accompanied by increases in urinary water and sodium excretion. In spontaneously hypertensive rats, alacepril (30 and 100 mg/kg p.o.) showed increases in urinary excretion of bradykinin and 6-keto-prostaglandin Fl alpha, and a decrease in that of aldosterone accompanied by increased in excretion of water and sodium. These results indicate that the antihypertensive activity of alacepril is due to the suppression of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and the enhancement of kallikrein-kinin-prostaglandin system through the inhibition of ACE (kininase II) activity in vivo.", 
    "58": "The fate of protein conjugate of desacetyl-alacepril (DU-1227) and its effect on angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) activity in renal hypertensive rats were studied. [14C]DU-1227-protein conjugate was prepared by ultrafiltration method and administered intravenously in rats. Elimination of radioactivity of [14C]DU-1227-protein from plasma after injection seemed much slower than that reported of [14C]alacepril (1-[(S)-3-acetylthio-2-methylpropanoyl]-L-prolyl-L-phenylalanine, DU-1219) given orally. In the plasma unbound fraction, captopril and captopril-cysteine were detected. Most tissue levels were higher than plasma levels. Significant reduction of tissue ACE activity was seen after administration of the conjugate. Radioactivity was mostly excreted in feces. Captopril, captopril disulfide and captopril-cysteine were found as urinary metabolites. These findings indicate that protein-bound DU-1227 readily dissociated and released DU-1227 was converted to captopril in vivo and can therefore participate in prolonged hypotensive effect exerted by alacepril.", 
    "59": "Tissue levels, tissue angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and hypotension were examined 20 min, 1, 5 and 14 h after oral administration of 1-[(S)-3-acetylthio-2-methylpropanoyl]-L-prolyl-L-phenylalanine (alacepril, DU-1219) (37.5 mg (92 mumol)/kg) or 1-[(S)-3-mercapto-2-methylpropanoyl]-L-proline (captopril) (20.0 mg (92 mumol)/kg) in renal hypertensive rats, using 14C-labeled compounds. Alacepril exerted a more gradual and more sustained antihypertensive effect than captopril. The maximal hypotension was observed 1 and 5 h after administration of captopril and alacepril, respectively. After administration of [14C]captopril, serum level reached the maximum at 20 min and then decreased rapidly. After administration of [14C]alacepril, serum level reached the maximum at 1 h and decreased more slowly than after [14C]captopril. Time course patterns of tissue levels were essentially in parallel with those of serum levels. Captopril exerted the maximal reduction of ACE activity in tissues 20 min after oral administration and thereafter, the reduction was diminished with time rapidly. [14C]Alacepril showed gradual reduction (the maximum at 1 h) and recovery of ACE activity relative to captopril. After oral administration of [14C]alacepril, tissue unbound fractions contained captopril and its derived metabolites while serum unbound fraction contained the intermediate metabolite desacetyl-alacepril (DU-1227) as well. Correlations between ACE inhibition and tissue levels and between changes in tissue ACE inhibition and in blood pressure with time after oral administration of the two agents were discussed. Furthermore, the direct comparison of alacepril and captopril was attempted by the difference in blood pressures and in ACE inhibitions induced after oral administration of the agents.", 
    "60": "In 24 patients with mild/moderate essential hypertension, we studied the effects of captopril with/without hydrochlorothiazide (Htz) on blood pressure, the renin-angiotensin system, blood bradykinin concentration (BBK), plasma volume, exchangeable sodium and glomerular filtration. Daily captopril doses of 75 and 150 mg were equally effective in reducing the blood pressure. Addition of Htz caused further blood pressure reductions. Nineteen patients attained a diastolic blood pressure less than or equal to 90 mmHg. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition with captopril led to a fall in plasma concentrations of angiotensin II (PAII) and renin substrate, and an increase in plasma concentrations of renin and angiotensin I. Patients starting with Htz had a higher PAII and subsequently a larger fall in blood pressure on captopril than untreated patients. BBK remained unchanged, indicating that the hypotensive action of captopril does not involve an accumulation of circulating kinin. Body fluid volumes and renal function were not affected by the various treatment regimens.", 
    "61": "The effect of bilirubin on serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity was studied with spectrophotometric and radionuclide assays. In the spectrophotometric assay addition of bilirubin to normal serum from dog, mouse, and human produced a dose-related inhibition of ACE activity. A 50% decrease in human ACE activity was produced by the addition of approximately 250 mg/L in vitro. Serum from icteric patients with elevated bilirubin was also associated with a reduction in ACE activity in the spectrophotometric assay. A 50% decrease in ACE activity in these samples was associated with a serum bilirubin of approximately 220 mg/L. In the radionuclide assay, however, addition of bilirubin to normal human serum failed to reduce measured ACE activity. The use of a radionuclide assay for serum ACE in clinical samples offers the advantage of less interference from serum bilirubin.", 
    "62": "Urinary excretion of thromboxane B2 (TXB2), a stable metabolite of thromboxane A2 (TXA2), was measured by radioimmunoassay in 7 essential hypertensive patients before and after a converting enzyme inhibitor, SQ 14225, administration. When a single oral dose of SQ 14225 (50mg) was given to 7 patients with essential hypertension, urinary excretion of TXB2 was increased significantly (from 58.9 +/- 18.1 to 116.1 +/- 20.7 pg/min, mean +/- SE, P less than 0.02) with simultaneous increase in plasma renin activity, urine volume, urinary sodium, urinary potassium and urinary excretion of PGE (from 58.8 +/- 12.8 to 135.1 +/- 30.0 pg/min, mean +/- SE, P less than 0.05). These results indicate that SQ 14225 stimulates vasoconstricting TXA2 production as well as vasodilating PGE production.", 
    "63": "The role of the brain renin-angiotensin system in the ACTH response to ether stress in rats was investigated by injecting the angiotensin II receptor blocking drug saralasin, the angiotensin II converting enzyme inhibitors enalaprilat and captopril, and the renin inhibitor L 363714 intraventricularly and measuring the ACTH and corticosterone concentration in plasma 10 min after ether stress. ACTH and corticosterone were elevated to at least the same level in rats treated with the inhibitors as they were in rats treated with the corresponding vehicles; indeed, ACTH values were somewhat greater in stressed rats treated with the converting enzyme inhibitors and the renin inhibitor. ACTH values in the absence of ether were not affected by saralasin, enalaprilat, and captopril and were increased by L 363714. The data do not support the hypothesis that the brain renin-angiotensin system is involved in the maintenance of ACTH secretion or that it mediates the increase produced by ether stress.", 
    "64": "Enalaprilat (MK-422), an intravenously administered angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, which is the parent compound of the oral angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril (MK-421), was studied in 11 patients with asymptomatic accelerated hypertension. Each patient received an initial intravenous dose of 1 mg, followed at one-hour intervals by enalaprilat 10 mg, furosemide 40 mg, and enalaprilat 40 mg. Six of 11 patients responded with a drop in mean arterial pressure greater than 15 mm Hg to diastolic levels below 110 mm Hg; there were four partial responders and one nonresponder. Pretreatment renins were not predictive of blood pressure response. No patient had any adverse reaction to the drug; there were no significant changes in posttreatment laboratory values. We conclude that enalaprilat is an effective, well-tolerated agent for the treatment of uncomplicated accelerated hypertension and its use does not imperil nonresponding uncomplicated patients.", 
    "65": "A novel inhibitor of angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE), designated K-26, was isolated from the broth filtrate of an actiomycete K-26. K-26 is a water soluble, acidic peptide composed of an equal mol of L-isoleucine, L-tyrosine and 1(R)-1-amino-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-ethylphosphonic acid. The IC50 of K-26 for ACE inhibition was 6.7 ng/ml when hippuryl-L-histidyl-L-leucine was used as a substrate of ACE. K-26 possesses hypotensive activity in vivo.", 
    "66": "To investigate whether dopamine plays a role in the regulation of aldosterone secretion during long-term blockade of the renin-angiotensin system, we studied the effect of metoclopramide, a competitive antagonist of dopamine, in 6 patients with essential hypertension chronically treated with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril. All but one of these patients received a diuretic in addition to enalapril. Six hours after the daily morning dose of enalapril (10-40 mg p.o.) a 10 mg bolus dose of metoclopramide was injected intravenously. In one patient a hypotensive episode developed following metoclopramide administration. In the 5 other patients plasma aldosterone significantly rose within 30 min after metoclopramide from 51 +/- 8.7 to 128.2 +/- 29.2 pg/ml. This metoclopramide-induced release of aldosterone occurred in the absence of concomitant changes in circulating angiotensin 11, potassium and ACTH levels. Metoclopramide given during chronic blockade of the renin-angiotensin system caused anxiety and agitation in 2 patients. The increase in plasma aldosterone following competitive dopamine blockade in the face of chronic angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition, unchanged plasma potassium and ACTH levels strongly suggests that in hypertensive patients, dopamine exerts a direct inhibitory effect on aldosterone secretion.", 
    "67": "The pharmacokinetics of enalaprilat were studied after administration of single and multiple doses of enalapril maleate to people with normal and impaired renal function. Renal impairment was associated with higher serum concentrations of enalaprilat, longer times to peak concentrations, slower decline of serum concentrations and with reduced urinary elimination. Urinary elimination of enalaprilat was closely related to renal function. In patients with severe renal impairment (GFR values below 30 ml min-1 1.73 m-2) significantly smaller doses of enalapril maleate will be required than in patients with normal or less severely impaired renal function.", 
    "68": "To investigate conformations of peptide inhibitors of the angiotensin-converting enzyme in the enzyme-inhibitor complex, the synthesis, studies of inhibitory activity, and conformational calculations of analogues of bradykinin-potentiating peptides with N-methylalanine or D-alanine in place of L-proline or L-alanine residues have been carried out. All the analogues showed a sharp decrease of inhibitory activity in comparison with the natural peptides, that might be considered as an indirect confirmation of the earlier proposed \"conformation of inhibition\" of the above-mentioned peptides.", 
    "69": "Acute and 1-month toxicity studies with SCH 31846, a nonsulfhydryl anti-hypertensive agent which acts by inhibiting angiotensin-converting enzyme, were initiated to evaluate its toxicity. The oral LD50s in mice and rats were approximately 1.8 and 2.5 g/kg, respectively, while the iv LD50 was approximately 450 mg/kg in mice and 150 mg/kg in rats. Signs of acute toxicity in rats and mice included salivation, hypoactivity, ataxia, prostration, and convulsions. In a 1-month dog study at oral doses of 25, 75, or 150 mg/kg, there was a dose-related increase in emesis between 1 and 2 hr after dosing. Absorption studies showed peak blood concentrations occurring in dogs between 0.3 and 1 hr after dosing. No other noteworthy antemortem changes were observed. In a 1-month rat study at oral doses of 30, 180, or 600 mg/kg, the hematocrit and hemoglobin values of the 600 mg/kg-dosed female rats were slightly but significantly (p less than 0.05) decreased and the blood urea nitrogen was slightly but significantly (p less than 0.05) increased in all SCH 31846-dosed male rats and the 600 mg/kg-dosed female rats. Absorption studies in male rats at doses of 30, 180, and 600 mg/kg indicate that SCH 31846 is well absorbed in rats. The 150 mg/kg-dosed dogs and the 180- and 600 mg/kg-dosed rats had a slight increase in the number of renin-containing granules in the renal juxtaglomerular cells. No other compound-related microscopic changes were observed. These data are similar to data reported for Captopril and suggest that in the dog and rat the toxicity of ACE inhibitors is not dependent upon the presence or absence of a sulfhydryl group.", 
    "70": "We evaluated the effect of additional chlorthalidone therapy on blood pressure and body fluid volumes in 10 patients with essential hypertension who did not respond to chronic converting enzyme inhibition with enalapril. Values assessed after 3 days and 6 weeks of combined enalapril and chlorthalidone therapy were compared with initial values during enalapril monotherapy. After 3 days the mean arterial pressure (MAP), plasma volume (PV), blood volume (BV), and extracellular fluid volume (ECFV) decreased. There was a positive correlation between the percentage decreases in MAP and BV. After 6 weeks the MAP decreased further, but the decreases in PV, BV, and ECFV were less pronounced. At this time there was a positive correlation between the percentage decreases in MAP and ECFV. Our results support the hypothesis that contraction of the ECFV is an antihypertensive mechanism of diuretics. The antihypertensive effect of diuretics is enhanced during converting enzyme inhibition, while the body remains protected against volume deficits, possibly by the lower blood pressure itself.", 
    "71": "Essential components of the renin-angiotensin system such as renin enzymes, angiotensinogen, converting enzyme, and angiotensin receptors have been found in vascular tissues. Locally generated angiotensin (ANG) II may regulate vascular tone by contracting vascular smooth muscle or potentiating sympathetic activity. Recently it was suggested that beta-adrenoceptor-induced enhancement of noradrenergic neurotransmission is mediated by the vascular renin-angiotensin system. The present study was designated to obtain direct evidence for the release of ANG II from the vasculature by beta-adrenoceptor activation. Isolated rat mesenteric arteries were perfused in vitro with Krebs-Ringer solution, and released ANG II was concentrated in a Sep-Pak C-18 cartridge connected to the perfusion system. High-pressure liquid chromatography combined with radioimmunoassay clearly demonstrated the presence of ANG I, II, and a small amount of ANG III in the perfusate. Isoproterenol (10(-9) - 10(-6) M) induced the enhancement of pressor responses to nerve stimulation. This effect was markedly suppressed by propranolol (5 X 10(-7) M), captopril (2 X 10(-6) M), or [Sar1-Ile8]ANG II (10(-6) M). Isoproterenol (10(-9) - 10(-6) M) caused increase in the release of ANG II from mesenteric arteries. The increase in ANG II release during isoproterenol (10(-6) M) infusion was blocked by propranolol (10(-6) M). Captopril (2 X 10(-6) M) also inhibited the increase in ANG II induced by isoproterenol. These results indicate that locally generated ANG II is released from isolated perfused rat mesenteric arteries and its release is mediated by beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "72": "We investigated the effects of angiotensin peptides on the breakdown of specific membrane phospholipids, the inositol lipids, in anterior pituitary cells in culture, measuring the water-soluble products (inositol phosphates) produced during the cleavage of phosphoinositides by phospholipase C. Both angiotensin II and angiotensin I in the presence of 10 mM LiCl potently increased, in a concentration-dependent manner, total [3H]inositol phosphate and PRL release in cultured rat anterior pituitary cells. The release of LH, TSH, or GH was not significantly enhanced by the peptides. The effect on inositol phosphate accumulation was significant at 0.01 nM, and maximal stimulation (approximately 5-fold increase) occurred at 10 nM, with an ED50 of about 0.3 nM. The stimulatory effects of both angiotensin II and angiotensin I were antagonized by the receptor antagonists saralasin and Sar1,Ile8-angiotensin II. Moreover, 1 microM captopril, an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme, antagonized the effects of 0.1 and 1 nM angiotensin I, suggesting that the effect of angiotensin I on phosphoinositide breakdown and PRL release is dependent on prior conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. The effect of angiotensin II was very rapid. Fractionation of the water-soluble inositol phosphates showed that angiotensin II significantly increased inositol bisphosphate and inositol triphosphate at 10 sec, whereas inositol monophosphate was increased only after 40 sec. These data indicate that in the pituitary, and presumably in the lactotroph, the binding of angiotensin II to specific membrane receptors provokes increased polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis, leading to increased production of intracellular messengers, i.e. inositol triphosphate and 1,2-diacylglycerol, responsible for the stimulation of PRL release.", 
    "73": "Adult rats treated neonatally with guanethidine had normal arterial blood pressures, but these were more dependent on the renin-angiotensin system than in control animals. Antagonism of V1-receptors (with d(CH2)5DAVP) enhanced the depressor effects of captopril in guanethidine-treated animals, but blood pressure was unaffected by this manoeuvre in control animals. Although there is evidence that sympathetic efferent vasomotor function is abolished following the schedule of neonatal guanethidine treatment used, pentolinium had a hypotensive effect in the presence of d(CH2)5DAVP and captopril, indicating that the adrenal medulla could have been contributing to the maintenance of blood pressure. This is consistent with the finding of marked supersensitivity to exogenous adrenaline in guanethidine-treated rats.", 
    "74": "This study was performed to assess myocardial involvement in 18 children with severe hypertension (HT), using two dimensional (2D) guided M mode echocardiography, prior and during therapy. All patients but 2 had renal or renovascular disease. Septal diastolic thickness (SDT) was utilized as a serial marker. Except for one case, all patients had increased SDT initially (1.03 +/- .26 cm/m2, p less than .01 vs normal). Evolution under therapy allowed subdivision of patients: Group I: 12 patients showed left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy regression, within a follow-up period of 20 +/- 9 months (final SDT: .78 +/- .12 cm/m2 vs initial 1.09 +/- .28, p less than .01). Blood pressure (BP) was normalized in 9 patients, and borderline in 3. Therapy consisted on acebutolol (n = 10), captopril (n = 1), and renal artery surgery (n = 1). Group II: LV hypertrophy was unchanged (n = 3) or increased (n = 3), within a follow-up period of 19 +/- 8 months, with persistent severe (n = 3) or mild (n = 3) HT, under acebutolol (n = 5). Treatment was changed to captopril with subsequent normal BP and echocardiogram improvement (n = 3). In the overall population, final SDT was significantly correlated to the final BP (r = .69, p less than .01). In conclusion, echocardiographic follow-up allowed serial non invasive assessment of LV hypertrophy in our severely hypertensive pediatric population. At first echocardiogram, LV hypertrophy was present in all patients but one. Antihypertensive therapy allowed simultaneous decrease of BP and LV hypertrophy in 12 patients, 10 under acebutolol.", 
    "75": "To test the hypothesis that acute angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition might predict the postoperative blood pressure outcome, a single oral dose of captopril ranging from 12.5 to 100 mg, was given to 26 patients with renovascular disease and its hypotensive effect was compared with that of surgery (21 patients) or of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) (5 patients). Both systolic and diastolic blood pressure fell significantly (p less than 0.001) from 179.9 +/- 5.4/114.1 +/- 2.1 to 148.4 +/- 3.8/94.1 +/- 1.9 after captopril and to 141.1 +/- 3.7/88.9 +/- 2.0 at least 3 months after operation. Postoperative pressure values were directly related to those after captopril (SBP: r = 0.65, p less than 0.001; DBP: r = 0.45, p less than 0.05) as were their absolute decrements (SBP: r = 0.70, p less than 0.001; DBP: r = 0.64, p less than 0.001). However, after captopril, individual pressure tended to be higher (and their decrements to be lower) than after operation. 12 out of 19 patients cured by surgery were considered cured by captopril, while 5 out of the remaining 7 were improved and 2 not cured. The 6 patients improved by surgery or PTA were also improved by captopril and the only patient not cured by surgery was not cured by captopril. Therefore, if we consider both cure and improvement as a positive result, the captopril test gave 23 true-positive, 1 true-negative and 2 false-negative responses. Taken together, these data suggest that acute ACE inhibition may be an useful tool in predicting postoperative blood pressure of patients with renovascular disease.", 
    "76": "In 60 patients with hypertension and unilateral renal artery stenosis (URAS) radio-hippuran renograms were performed before and 6 weeks after anatomically adequate percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA). Two characteristics of the renographic curves have been analyzed: the difference in time to peak (DTP) between the affected and contralateral kidneys, which would be expected to be positive in blood flow impairment, and the relative hippuran uptake (RHU) in the second minute by the affected kidney as compared with the total uptake by both kidneys: this would be less than 50% in the case of stenosis. Before PTA, both variables were predominantly abnormal. The DTP did not predict the blood pressure response to PTA. The group of patients with a RHU between 25 and 45% comprised all cured patients and predicted a more favorable response of the blood pressure than a RHU of less than 25% and especially more than 45% which group contained 83% patients whose blood pressure failed to respond after PTA. After PTA the DTP did normalize in the majority of patients, but this was not related to the blood pressure response. The RHU increased in patients in whom it had been low initially, but frequently remained low (less than 45%). The increase of the RHU was significantly higher in patients with a favorable blood pressure response. Pretreatment with captopril did intensify the abnormal curves of hippuran and of DTPA renograms in 6 patients with URAS who did respond favorably to PTA. There was no such deterioration in 2 patients whose blood pressure did not change sufficiently after PTA or in 4 patients without renal artery stenosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "77": "Endogenous opioid peptides, by modulating the release of sympathetic transmitters, may play a role in the pathogenesis of migraine and related headaches which are considered hypernociceptive syndromes. Hypoendorphinaemia has been demonstrated in migraine attack. Captopril, a drug able to potentiate morphine analgesia in rats and inhibit enkephalinase in animals and in man, improves the clinical course of migraine. In the present research the cerebrospinal fluid and plasma beta-endorphin (beta-EP) levels have been evaluated following a single oral dose of captopril. The drug increased plasma beta-EP levels in migraine sufferers, and these data may be relevant in the mechanism of action of this drug in migraine and related headaches.", 
    "78": "To characterize the decrease in glomerular permeability that occurs in contralateral kidney of renovascular hypertension, glomerular hemodynamics were studied in Goldblatt hypertensive and normotensive control rats. The effects of converting enzyme inhibition (captopril) and renal vasodilatation induced with hyperoncotic plasma were evaluated: in addition, glomerular morphometry was performed. In hypertension, glomerular capillary pressure was increased, ultrafiltration coefficient was decreased, single-nephron filtration rate was normal and afferent resistance was elevated. Captopril rose glomerular filtration rate only in normotensive rats, but ultrafiltration coefficient increased in both groups. Hyperoncotic plasma induced a 98% increment in filtration rate and ultrafiltration coefficient rose by 48% in normotensive group. In hypertensive rats, filtration rate increased only 15% and ultrafiltration coefficient diminished 6%, morphometric studies showed dilatation of capillary loops and a larger glomerular volume. Similar response to captopril in both groups of rats suggest that the reduction in ultrafiltration coefficient in hypertension is not dependent of angiotensin; lack of response to hyperoncotic plasma suggests that it could be produced by structural changes in capillary wall that diminish hydraulic permeability since the larger glomerular volume indicates a greater area for filtration.", 
    "79": "Plasma concentrations of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) were measured in 8 patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) of NYHA functional class III-IV, before and during treatment with captopril, 6.25-25.0 mg t.i.d., added to their drug regimen. Before captopril treatment, plasma ADH was high, 2.5 times the upper limit of normal reference values. During treatment with captopril, plasma ADH levels were normalized, and remained so throughout the study, for at least 6 months. Plasma levels of angiotensin II were also reduced to a normal level. Reduction of plasma ADH during captopril treatment in CHF may partly depend on reduced angiotensin II formation, and may be beneficial by improving water balance. Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), was measured by radioimmunoassay in 17 patients with CHF. The highest levels were measured in the most severe CHF cases, and intermediate high values on NYHA functional class I-II patients. Plasma ANP concentrations in control patients (n = 18) without cardiac diseases ranged between 0 and 30 pg/ml. In two patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, associated with transient polyuria, high plasma ANP concentrations were noticed during tachycardic episodes. Thus, ANP appears to be a circulating hormone in humans, and is released into the blood in clinical conditions associated with raised preload and atrial wall stretch.", 
    "80": "The renal glomeruli are vulnerable to injury by a number of drugs and other toxic agents. These agents may lead to damage by one of two basic mechanisms: direct, dose-related toxic injury; indirect, immunologically mediated injury, largely dose-independent. Proteinuria is the simplest and most important functional indicator of glomerular injury. It occurs almost immediately in direct toxic injury, but there is a latent period of weeks to months with immunologically mediated processes. Of the two mechanisms, the second is by far the more common in clinical settings. The best studied experimental agent causing direct toxic injury is the aminonucleoside of puromycin. Clinically, perhaps the most important agent is Cyclosporine A. Although this agent is usually thought of primarily as a tubular toxin, it is capable of giving rise to a microangiopathic glomerular lesion similar to that in the hemolytic uremic syndrome. The classic model for immunologic glomerular lesion is Heymann nephritis, which produces a membranous glomerulopathy. Clinically, most drug mediated glomerulopathies also take the form of a membranous nephropathy, usually with a frank nephrotic syndrome. Among the more common offenders are penicillamine, gold salts used in rheumatoid arthritis, and captopril used in hypertension. The other common type of drug-related glomerulopathy occurs as part of a lupus-like syndrome induced by a variety of drugs, including hydralazine, procainamide, and penicillamine. All of these give rise to a variety of antibodies, most prominently antinuclear antibodies, and in the more severe cases there may be lupus-like glomerular lesions as well.", 
    "81": "The mechanisms of blood pressure regulation in periarteritis nodosa and systemic sclerodermia are discussed in the light of results of personal studies. Hypertension during PAN may be divided into two groups: hypertension related to renal microangiopathy responsible for stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system which often runs a severe course, sometimes accompanied by renal insufficiency and requiring treatment with beta-blocking agents or angiotensin conversion enzyme inhibitors; secondly, hypertension may not be linked to the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and the prognosis is then better. In systemic sclerodermia, a similar pattern may be found but it would also seem that the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system may be stimulated in the absence of any hypertension. This rise in plasma renin activity and aldosterone preceding the onset of an acute sclerodermic renal episode has a very poor prognosis. Corticosteroid therapy may favour such a process. Other regulation mechanisms are also discussed: prostaglandins, bradykinin system.", 
    "82": "The study was performed to determine whether the brain renin angiotensin system may contribute to the acceleration in hypertension following long-term salt loading in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Five weeks old SHR and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) were given 1% NaCl solution or plain tap water as drinking for 7 weeks. The salt treatment exaggerated the development of hypertension in SHR, but did not change the blood pressure (BP) in WKY. The hypotensive actions of intracerebroventricular (ICV) captopril was greater in SHR treated with salt than in those without treatment, whereas ICV AII increased BP to a similar degree between salt and control SHR. In WKY, the effects of ICV captopril and AII were not altered by the salt loading. The increases in BP induced by ICV hypertonic saline were not different between the rats with and without saline drinking in either SHR or WKY. The intravenous (IV) hexamethonium led to a greater fall in BP in SHR treated with saline than in those without salt, while it tended to produce a smaller decrease in BP in WKY with salt overload than in those without loading. Both duration and magnitude of the depressor effects of IV captopril were reduced by the chronic saline treatment in SHR. The plasma renin concentration (PRC) in both SHR and WKY was significantly suppressed by the salt load. The present results suggest that long-term salt overload may result in the enhanced activity of brain renin angiotensin system, which could be responsible for the exaggerated development of hypertension in SHR. Our observations also provide further evidence that the central renin angiotensin system is independent of the peripheral system.", 
    "83": "We report on 29 treatment courses in 25 children aged 1.5-18 years who received captopril because of severe renal hypertension. The mean initial dosage was 1.3 (0.5 to 3) mg/kg/day and the mean sustaining dose 2.2 mg/kg/day. The treatment was followed for 2-40 (mean 15) months. We observed a lowering of both systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) from 26% at the 2nd day to 65% at the 6th month. The isolated use of captopril was ineffective in 13% of cases, but blood pressure dropped in all of them after addition of beta blocking agents. No clear-cut relation was found between response of blood pressure and etiology, degree of HT or plasma renin activity (PRA). No side effects occurred during treatment except for one case of reversible acute renal failure in a transplanted patient with renal artery stenosis.", 
    "84": "Captopril (CA), a specific inhibitor of kininase II, did not alter osmotic water permeability (Posm) when present in the mucosal bath of the urinary bladder isolated from the toad Bufo arenarum at a concentration of 2.3 X 10(-3) M. This treatment, however, caused a 65% enhancement in the increase in Posm following serosal exposure to vasopressin, oxytocin or theophylline, agents that increase intracellular cyclic AMP levels. The effect of captopril was prevented by procedures that reduce the kallikrein (KK)-like alkaline esterase activity present in the bladder (such as simultaneous exposure to 2.3 X 10(-5) M aprotinin, or pretreatment of the toads with 0.1 N NaCl for several days before the experiment) or by replacing the mucosal bath with fresh solution of identical composition after exposure to captopril. In contrast, changing the serosal bath did not alter the effect of the drug. These results are consistent with an effect of CA at a step beyond cAMP generation, and suggest it is mediated by release of a soluble factor, probably a kinin, into the mucosal bath. These observations, together with data previously published, suggest that the KK-kinin system may participate in the control of epithelial water and electrolyte permeability in the toad bladder. In particular, under environmental stress, it may become important in the regulation of the animal's extracellular fluid volume, thus exhibiting an adaptive value.", 
    "85": "The development of new vasoactive drugs has increased the possibilities to treat patients with digital vasospasm, known as Raynaud's phenomenon. The purpose of this paper is to give a review of recent clinical trials and also a short review of the pathophysiological reasons for each type of pharmacological treatment.", 
    "86": "Chronic somatostatin administration was found to partially reverse the ACTH-enhanced growth of the rat zona glomerulosa. The effect of somatostatin was completely superposable to that of captopril, a specific inhibitor of the angiotensin-converting enzyme, and the inhibitory actions of these two agents did not cumulate. Neither somatostatin nor captopril counteracted the ACTH-induced stimulation of the growth and steroidogenic capacity of the rat zona fasciculata. These findings support the view that somatostatin acts as an exclusive and specific modulator of the adrenoglomerulotrophic action of the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "87": "Angiotensin converting enzyme activity (ACEA) was determined in serum, kidney, whole skin and isolated epithelia homogenates of the South American toad Bufo arenarum. ACEA was present in the tissues and serum of the toad. The activity was higher in the kidney, as compared to that of the whole skin or isolated epithelium. Captopril, teprotide and EDTA, caused a significant decrease in the ACEA. Possible physiological roles for the presence of ACEA in the toad are discussed.", 
    "88": "The diverse potential etiologies and varying degrees of severity at the time of presentation suggest that primary pulmonary hypertension is a spectrum of disease states, all of which share the hemodynamic and pathologic correlates of pulmonary hypertension without a demonstrable cause. The course is variable, but manifestations of a low cardiac output or right ventricular failure imply a poor prognosis; the median survival is 2 to 3 years from the time of diagnosis. Although several systemic vasodilators have been demonstrated to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and ameliorate symptoms in some cases, these drugs may produce undesirable adverse effects, including death, in unresponsive patients. Additionally, the impact of vasodilator therapy on mortality from PPH has not been assessed. Combined heart-lung transplantation should be considered in patients who are unresponsive to vasodilators and who manifest the indicators of a poor prognosis.", 
    "89": "Enkephalin had been shown to be almost exclusively hydrolyzed by three peptidases in the previous studies. In the present investigation, the relative importance of three enzymes in the inactivation of [Leu5]-enkephalin was examined in three isolated preparations. Results showed that amastatin-sensitive aminopeptidase played the greatest role in both guinea-pig ileum and rat vas deferens while it played the similar role to either phosphoramdidon-sensitive endopeptidase-24.11 or captopril-sensitive peptidyl dipeptidase A in mouse vas deferens.", 
    "90": "An investigation of the therapeutic effect of a once daily dose of captopril was carried out on 19 patients with essential hypertension. Captopril was administered at a dose of 50 mg/day for 2 weeks. If blood pressure was not reduced to less than 160/95 mm Hg in that time, the dose was increased to 100 mg/day for a further 2 weeks (5 patients). If blood pressure remained high, 50 mg chlorthalidone/day was added (4 patients). Only 1 patient was not controlled. The drugs were administered in the morning. Blood pressure and serum angiotensin converting enzyme activity (SACE) were measured 24 hours after the last dose, and patients were followed up to 3 months. The basal SACE decreased 24 hours after the first captopril dose but 3 months later, when blood pressure was controlled, the mean level was back to baseline values. Our results show that once-daily captopril is efficacious in hypertension and its hypotensive effect appears to be independent of ACE inhibition.", 
    "91": "Components of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) have been found in heart tissue and it is likely that angiotensin II (ANG II) is generated locally in the heart as in other organs. Pharmacological interference with converting enzyme (CE) inhibitors reduced CE activity and ANG II generation in the heart. To investigate whether local inhibition of CE in the heart with the CE inhibitor ramipril might contribute to the therapeutic effects, experiments were performed in isolated perfused working rat hearts. Acute regional myocardial ischemia was induced by occlusion of the left coronary artery followed by reperfusion. In ischemic isolated rat hearts, both single oral pretreatment with ramipril (1 mg/kg) or perfusion with the active moiety, ramiprilat (10 micrograms/ml), protected against ventricular fibrillation, which invariably occurred in control hearts during reperfusion. Reperfusion arrhythmias were aggravated by perfusion with ANG I and ANG II, but prevented by bradykinin. ANG I-enhanced ventricular fibrillations were completely eliminated during local CE inhibition with ramipril. The CE inhibitor also improved cardiodynamics. Coronary flow, left ventricular pressure, dp/dtmax, and myocardial oxygen consumption were increased in comparison to controls without changes in heart rate. In the perfusate of treated hearts, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase activities and lactate production, were reduced. Myocardial tissue levels of glycogen, ATP, and creatine phosphate were increased in ramipril-pretreated hearts whereas lactate was decreased. The results of these experiments in rat hearts suggest that local inhibition of CE by ramipril exerts protective effects after ischemia and reperfusion by reducing arrhythmias and improving cardiac function and metabolism, thus probably contributing to the therapeutic effects of CE inhibitors in cardiovascular diseases.", 
    "92": "The spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) has many characteristics indicative of an overactive brain-angiotensin system. Since converting enzyme inhibitors are powerful hypotensive agents, the SHR was used to study the mechanisms of blood pressure reduction with MK421, MK422, Hoe498, and ramiprilat. A comparison of intraventricular (i.v.t.) to intravenous (i.v.) routes of administration showed that with MK421 the i.v.t. route was far more potent than the i.v. area. MK421 i.v.t. produced a profound and prolonged lowering of blood pressure in SHR. The blood pressure was reduced for a longer period than angiotensin II (ANG II) formation was inhibited. Ramiprilat decreased blood pressure in SHR for a prolonged period but was not significantly effective in the Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). The inhibition of ANG I pressor action correlated to the depressor effect. Brain ANG II was measured in different parts of the brain and plasma. With Hoe498 i.v. 50 micrograms/kg, there was an increase in hypothalamic angiotensin and plasma angiotensin. With MK422 i.v.t., there was a decrease in brain ANG II. Ramiprilat i.v.t. increased plasma ANG II and the variability of brain ANG II in different brain regions. In the SHR, ramiprilat decreased brainstem ANG II but did not change hypothalamic ANG II. High-pressure liquid chromatography characterization showed that the ANG II measured was authentic. In the SHR brain, ANG II was significantly higher in certain regions than in WKY. The results showed an increase of brain ANG II in normotensive animals with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor but a reduction of brainstem ANG II in the SHR. This may indicate the mechanism of lowering blood pressure in SHR is by disinhibition of the baroreflex.", 
    "93": "The discovery of tissue renin-angiotensin systems (RAS) in organs controlling the cardiovascular system has opened new perspectives for our understanding of the cardiovascular actions of converting enzyme (CE) inhibitors. Direct application of CE inhibitors to the brain and heart entails distinct cardiovascular effects. Systemic treatment with CE inhibitors leads not only to an inhibition of the plasma RAS, but it also inhibits tissue CE in various organs and reduces local angiotensin II concentrations. Evidence is presented that oral CE inhibitor treatment markedly influences organ function of the heart, brain, and vascular wall independently of the plasma RAS. These findings are compatible with the concept that tissue CE inhibition contributes to the beneficial actions of CE inhibitors in cardiovascular disease.", 
    "94": "The possible role of vascular angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is examined in vitro and in vivo. In helically cut strips of arteries isolated from dogs, contractions induced by angiotensin (ANG) I are suppressed by ACE inhibitor or ANG II antagonist. This indicates that vascular ACE contributes to the local formation of ANG II. In two-kidney, one-clip hypertensive rats, plasma-renin activity (PRA) rises rapidly with the elevation of blood pressure, then decreases gradually, despite sustained high blood pressure. Renin activity in the aorta also increases with the development of hypertension and then decreases in parallel with PRA. ACE activity in plasma does not change before or after the unilateral occlusion of the renal artery until after 16 weeks, whereas the enzyme activity in the aorta significantly increases. The conversion rate calculated from the pressor responses, and from the constricting effects of ANG I and ANG II, both in situ and in helically cut strips obtained from chronic hypertensive rats with increased vascular ACE activities, are significantly higher than those obtained from normotensive rats. Vascular ACE, which can effectively produce ANG II from ANG I locally, appears to play an important role in the maintenance of chronic hypertension.", 
    "95": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) was isolated from rabbit lung tissue by affinity chromatography on an N-(1-carboxy-5-aminopentyl)-L-alanylglycine resin. The molecular weight of the enzyme was determined to be 140,000, and upon isoelectric focusing a set of bands between pH 4.3-4.7 was observed. When the enzyme was treated with endoglycosidase F the molecular weight decreased to 100,000, and a virtually identical molecular weight was found for the in vitro translated form of ACE. The ACE-catalyzed hydrolysis of angiotensin I was followed by high-performance liquid chromatography separation and fluorescence monitoring of substrate and products. The kinetic parameters of the angiotensin I hydrolysis were KM = 17 mumol/L and kcat = 420 min-1 at pH 7.5. By the same analytical method the metabolism of angiotensin I by cultured endothelial cells and by the isolated, perfused rabbit aorta was investigated. Only a small fraction of angiotensin I was converted to angiotensin II; the larger part was directly degraded to small peptides. In the presence of ACE inhibitors no angiotensin II was formed but the rate of the angiotensin I hydrolysis was virtually unchanged. Thus, the action of ACE is critical to the generation of angiotensin II but not to the degradation of angiotensin I, and during ACE inhibition no accumulation of angiotensin I occurs.", 
    "96": "Studies were performed in normotensive volunteers and hypertensive subjects to examine the effect on forearm blood flow (FBF) of brachial artery infusions of angiotensin I (ANG I), angiotensin II (ANG II), and ramiprilat [the active metabolite of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, ramipril]. Ramiprilat (10 mcg/min for 10 min) produced a 71% mean increase in FBF (n = 8; range, 26-130%; p less than 0.001) in vessels preconstricted with ANG I (64-128 pmol/min), with the effect maximal at the end of ramiprilat infusion and subsiding over 30 min. Doses of ANG I required to produce equivalent reductions of FBF were 2 to 4 times those of ANG II before ramiprilat, but after ramiprilat the dose of ANG I required to produce equivalent constriction was increased 20-fold (n = 6; p = 0.01) while that of ANG II was unaltered. Ramiprilat given alone produced only a small nonsignificant increase in FBF of 7 +/- 4% (n = 12; p = 0.29), though this increase did correlate significantly with plasma renin (r = 0.60; p = 0.04). These results confirm the presence of ACE within human resistance vessels and suggest the possibility that inhibition of ACE at sites other than the pulmonary bed might contribute to the hypotensive action of ACE inhibitors.", 
    "97": "In order to gain insight into the local actions of angiotensin II (ANG II) we have determined the distribution of a component of the effector system for the peptide, the ANG II receptor, and that of an enzyme-catalysing ANG II formation, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), by in vitro autoradiography in several target tissues. The superagonist ANG II analog, 125I[Sar1]ANG II, or the antagonist analog, 125I[Sar1,Ile8]ANG II, were used as specific radioligands for ANG II receptors. A derivative of the specific ACE inhibitor, lysinopril, called 125I-351A, was used to label ACE in tissues. In the adrenal, a high density of ANG II receptors occurs in the glomerulosa zone of the cortex and in the medulla. ACE is also localized in these two zones, indicating that local production of ANG II may occur close to its sites of action in the zona glomerulosa and adrenal medulla. In the kidney, a high density of ANG II receptors is associated with glomeruli in the cortex and also with vasa recta bundles in the inner stripe of the outer medulla. ACE is found in very high concentration in deep proximal convoluted tubules of the cortex, while much lower concentrations of the enzyme occur in the vascular endothelium throughout the kidney. In the central nervous system three classes of relationships between ANG II receptors and ACE are observed: In the circumventricular organs, including the subfornical organ and organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis, a high concentration of both components occurs. Since these structures have a deficient blood-brain barrier, local conversion of circulating angiotensin I (ANG I) to ANG II may contribute to the action of ANG II at these sites.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "98": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is one of a class of zinc peptidases that utilize glutamic acid as a catalytic residue. ACE also has important arginine and tyrosine residues that are involved in substrate binding and a lysine that binds chloride. Chloride activation of ACE depends on the particular substrate employed. It is an essential activator of class I substrates and a nonessential activator of class II substrates. Radiationless energy transfer using substrates labeled with the fluorescent dansyl group indicates that chloride promotes a two-step binding process. The second step is a change in protein conformation that can be monitored using fluorescent inhibitors. The chloride binding constant for the ACE-inhibitor complex at pH 7.5 is 2.2 mM.", 
    "99": "Previous studies have indicated that intrarenal converting enzyme (CE) inhibition had no influence on renal blood flow (RBF). The present study examined the effect of intrarenal CE inhibition with captopril on the distribution of left (L) RBF in the anesthetized rabbit. Systemic arterial blood pressure and LRBF were measured in pentobarbital anesthetized rabbits, the latter by electromagnetic flowmetry. Radiolabeled 15-mu microspheres (85Sr and 141Ce) were used to determine RBF distribution. A dose of captopril that blocked the LRBF response to angiotensin I (ANG I), 0.3 microgram/kg/min i.a., but had no effect on the response to ANG I i.v. was established. Captopril administered i.a. at 0.2 microgram/kg/min for 20 min into the left renal artery decreased the response to ANG I i.a. by 71% without any effect on the response to ANG I i.v. The deep to superficial cortical blood flow ratio was unaffected by infusion of captopril i.a. in normal rabbits. In animals treated with furosemide, the ratio was increased by captopril infusion. However, the ratio change occurred in the infused and noninfused kidneys, negating a selective intrarenal effect. In the second part of this investigation the influence of a maximally effective i.a. dose of captopril was determined on intrarenal CE and RBF. The dose of 6.4 micrograms/kg/min of captopril increased LRBF slightly, but decreased the RBF response to ANG I i.a. only by 30%. Induction of a secondary pathway of intrarenal conversion of ANG I to ANG II is suggested by the latter results.", 
    "100": "On the isolated perfused rat kidney, the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity was evaluated with two approaches: one, pharmacological, through the vasoconstrictor response to angiotensin I (ANG I), and the other, biochemical, through the measurements of the enzymatic activity on renal homogenate. ANG I and angiotensin II (ANG II) induced a concentration-dependent renal vasoconstriction (EC50 = 10.5 +/- 1.8 X 10(-9) and 1.1 +/- 0.5 X 10(-9) M, respectively). Both responses were competitively antagonized by an ANG II receptor antagonist, saralasin (pA2 = 8.65 +/- 0.63 and 8.94 +/- 0.28, respectively). The effects of ACE inhibitors were studied in vitro after addition of captopril and ramiprilat (10(-5) M) directly to the perfusion medium, and ex vivo, after pretreatment of the rats with ramipril (50 mg/kg, i.p. the day before or 10 mg/kg/day, per os, over 3 weeks). In spite of the high doses of ACE inhibitors used, the ANG I concentration-response curve was only shifted to the right by a factor of 4, although renal tissue ACE activity was completely inhibited. Saralasin (10(-5) M) totally abolished the ANG I-induced vasoconstriction elicited in the presence of ACE inhibitors, this response being therefore linked to a generation of ANG II from ANG I. Our results suggest that, on the isolated perfused rat kidney, ANG II may be formed from ANG I by a peptidyl dipeptidase different from the ACE.", 
    "101": "The effect of a beta-adrenoceptor agonist on the release of the components of the vascular renin-angiotensin system was examined in vitro. Isolated rat mesenteric arteries were perfused in an open system with Krebs-Ringer solution and released immunoreactive angiotensin II (ANG IIir) into the perfusate was directly determined using a Sep-Pak C-18 cartridge connected to the perfusion system. Renin activity in the concentrated perfusate was also determined. Isoproterenol (1 nM-1 microM) increased the release of ANG IIir in a dose-dependent manner. The increase in ANG IIir release during isoproterenol (1 microM) infusion was inhibited by propranolol (1 microM) or captopril (2 microM). Isoproterenol-induced increment of ANG IIir release was blocked by the selective beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, ICI 118,551 (1 microM), but not by the selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, atenolol (1 microM). Renin activity in the perfusate was measurable, but did not increase in response to isoproterenol (1 microM) infusion. There was no significant difference in the response of ANG IIir release to isoproterenol between spontaneously hypertensive rats and Wistar-Kyoto rats. The present results indicate that locally generated ANG II is released by beta 2-adrenoceptor activation. The beta-adrenoceptor agonist and the vascular renin-angiotensin system may play an important role for the regulation of peripheral vascular tone.", 
    "102": "The effect of circulating arginine vasopressin (AVP) on blood pressure, heart rate, and skin blood flow was assessed in normotensive subjects, mild hypertensive patients, and patients with congestive heart failure, utilizing the specific antagonist of AVP at the vascular receptor level, d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)AVP (5 micrograms/kg i.v.). The renin system of the normal volunteers treated with the AVP antagonist was either intact or acutely blocked with the angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitor captopril (25 mg p.o.). In some volunteers, the cardiovascular effect of AVP released by Finnish sauna or cigarette smoking was studied. In patients with congestive heart failure, hemodynamic measurements (pressures and cardiac output) were obtained invasively. Acute blockade of AVP vascular receptors produced no cardiovascular effect unless plasma AVP levels were markedly elevated. In our experience, abnormally high circulating AVP appears to be responsible for the decrease in skin blood flow induced by cigarette smoking and to some extent for the maintenance of vascular tone in the rare patients with particularly severe congestive heart failure.", 
    "103": "The increasing number of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors means that compounds with different enzyme kinetics, pharmacokinetics, bioavailability, and pharmacodynamics will appear. They will, however, all inhibit ACE, and their hypotensive effect will be a consequence of this action. Enalapril (MK-421) is an esterified prodrug, which in man is converted by the liver to the bioactive potent ACE inhibitor enalaprilate (enalaprilic acid, MK-422). This probably accounts for the slower plasma appearance of MK-422 and the longer duration of action of enalapril. The clinical significance of deesterification by the liver needs further study but minor abnormalities of liver function, such as occur in congestive heart failure, do not affect the rate of deesterification and hence the plasma enalaprilat levels. A close relationship between the plasma drug level, degree of ACE inhibition, and the hormonal and hypotensive effect can be demonstrated after both acute and chronic enalapril administration to hypertensive patients. Chronic therapy with enalapril leads to induction of ACE but in humans this is not sufficient to lead to resistance or tolerance to the drug. Enalapril offers an exciting new approach to the treatment of hypertension with some distinct advantages over conventional antihypertensive therapy.", 
    "104": "The renin-angiotensin system is activated in the majority of patients with chronic congestive heart failure. This may be part of the pathophysiology of the disease, a secondary phenomenon, or the result of intense diuretic therapy. Irrespective of the mechanism of renin-angiotensin activation, converting enzyme inhibitors are an effective form of therapy as well as a means to evaluate pathophysiologic mechanisms of congestive heart failure. Because of the activation of the renin-angiotensin system, angiotensin-mediated vasoconstriction and aldosterone-mediated sodium retention can be suppressed and, in some individuals, completely blocked by converting enzyme inhibitors. Improved forward cardiac flow and reduction of pulmonary congestion occur with reversal of vasoconstriction, so that relief of edema, due to enhanced sodium and water excretion, will occur. While it is easy to identify a close correlation between markers of renin-angiotensin activity and the initial response to converting enzyme inhibitors, it is more difficult to identify this response long-term. This may be due to changes in dietary sodium intake, intensity of diuretic therapy, or alteration in renal blood flow and function. Clinically, however, the response to converting enzyme inhibitors is favorable in the majority of people.", 
    "105": "There is no doubt that cardiac function can be restored to a great degree in congestive heart failure treated with converting-enzyme inhibitors, but the mechanism of improvement involves the correction of peripheral abnormalities rather than a direct cardiac effect of the drug. There is some evidence that deterioration of cardiac function and progressive cardiac dilation following myocardial infarction can be prevented by treatment with converting-enzyme inhibitors. Regression of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) has been obtained by converting-enzyme inhibitors, both in man and in experimental animals. In animal studies, this regression of LVH was associated with restoration of contractile reserve and of coronary flow reserve to normal. The final significance of this restoration of structure and its functional aspects still needs further studies.", 
    "106": "Essential hypertension is characterized by increased renal vascular resistance, which also has definite implications for renal sodium handling. We studied the possibility of correcting these abnormalities by inhibiting angiotensin-converting enzyme with enalapril. Enalaprilic acid produced renal vasodilation. This, particularly postglomerular, vasodilation was accompanied with an increase in sodium excretion. The natriuresis was positively correlated to initial plasma renin activity. During continuous treatment with enalapril up to 12 weeks, this vasodilation persisted in 22 patients with essential hypertension. We also showed that orally administered enalapril induces natriuresis, both during a 50-mmol and during a 200-mmol sodium intake a day. This natriuresis caused a net negative sodium balance of approximately 120-140 mmol Na after 1 week of enalapril therapy. This was accompanied with a fall in body weight. We conclude that enalapril in essential hypertension alleviates the angiotensin-II-mediated abnormalities in renal hemodynamics and sodium excretion.", 
    "107": "To assess dose-related effects of enalapril, we treated eight hospitalized hypertensive patients receiving constant sodium intake with incremental doses of this new angiotensin converting-enzyme blocking drug. After a few days of placebo treatment, enalapril was given in single daily doses, starting with 1.25 mg and increasing dosage until blood pressure was adequately controlled. At the lowest dose, converting enzyme activity was reduced by 50%, but angiotensin II and blood pressure did not change significantly. There were, however, significant increases in norepinephrine, renin, and aldosterone. With higher doses there was a more pronounced reduction in converting enzyme activity, whereas angiotensin II, aldosterone, and blood pressure all fell significantly. Renin levels rose, but norepinephrine and epinephrine were reduced. In a second study 20 hypertensive subjects were studied before and after 10 days of continued treatment with enalapril. Again, systolic and diastolic pressure were significantly reduced. Tachycardia or orthostatic hypotension did not occur. Endocrine changes were similar to those after a single effective dose of enalapril. In addition, we found renal vasodilation and enhanced natriuresis together with a 1.2 kg decrement in body weight. Concurrently, plasma volume rose but renal blood flow remained unchanged. The data indicate that enalapril effectively lowers blood pressure, and it does so by converting enzyme inhibition; sodium loss and a decrease in sympathetic activity are associated features. Since plasma volume increased despite enhanced natriuresis, the drug may act both at the arteriolar and at the venular level.", 
    "108": "It is widely accepted that pharmacologic reduction of the blood pressure of hypertensive patients reduces the risk of at least some of the major cardiovascular complications (1-5). All major studies were carried out before orally active converting enzyme inhibitors had become available. In other words, very effective antihypertensive drugs have been around for quite some time and have already proven their efficacy. Therefore, the considerable enthusiasm that has developed during the very recent years for the new converting enzyme inhibitors should be evaluated in the light of previously available antihypertensive drugs, the more so, as drugs cheaper than converting enzyme inhibiting agents are presently available. Thus, the increased expense when using this new class of antihypertensive compounds should be justified by a therapeutic gain. When evaluating a class of antihypertensive drugs such as converting enzyme inhibitors, there are basically three main considerations: What is their efficacy in long-term use? This includes the effect on blood pressure, on heart, on hemodynamics, and on blood flow distribution. What are the metabolic effects? What is the effect on sodium and potassium excretion? How are the serum lipids affected by its use? Are there any untoward effects related either to the chemical structure of the compound per se or rather to the approach? In particular, are there any central effects of the drug which can cause discomfort to the patient? The following discussion has the principal aim to review these aspects with chronic use of oral converting enzyme inhibiting agents without, however, even attempting to provide an exhaustive review of the subject.", 
    "109": "The renin-angiotensin system has a range of physiological actions concerned with the control of the circulation. Angiotensin II has both an immediate and a delayed pressor effect; it stimulates the secretion of aldosterone and antidiuretic hormone, promotes thirst, stimulates the sympathetic nervous system at various sites while inhibiting vagal tone, and has a range of direct effects on the kidney. Several aspects of this range of actions can become deranged in a number of forms of hypertension as well as in congestive cardiac failure. Hence much effort has been directed in recent years to the development of agents designed to interfere with the renin-angiotensin system and to apply these clinically in the treatment of hypertension and congestive cardiac failure. Orally active converting enzyme inhibitors are of proven benefit not only in renovascular hypertension, but also, when combined with loop diuretics, in the treatment of intractable hypertension as well as, both alone and in combination with thiazide diuretics, in the treatment of essential hypertension. In congestive cardiac failure controlled trials have shown that converting enzyme inhibitors can improve exercise tolerance while diminishing lassitude, correct potassium deficiency, and limit ventricular arrhythmias. Energetic efforts are being made to develop orally active inhibitors of the enzyme renin itself, since these should be more specific in action than the presently available and very successful converting enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "110": "The hemodynamic effects of enalaprilat (MK-422) and lisinopril (MK-521) were compared with the calcium channel blocker felodipine in dogs with ischemic left ventricular (LV) failure. The combination of nitrendipine plus enalapril was also examined in ischemic failure and in rats with spontaneous hypertension. In anesthetized dogs coronary embolization with 50 micron plastic microspheres reduced cardiac output and LV dP/dt max by approximately 40%, and LV end-diastolic pressure increased to greater than 13 mm Hg. Enalaprilat and lisinopril reduced mean arterial pressure by a maximum of 20 mm Hg and total peripheral resistance by approximately 30%. Left ventricular dP/dt:LVP, which was substantially decreased by embolization, was slightly increased by both angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. The calcium entry blockers felodipine and nitrendipine qualitatively produced many of the same hemodynamic effects as the ACE inhibitors, but, in addition, they markedly reduced coronary resistance, increased myocardial blood flow, and did not alter cardiac contractility (LV dP/dt max). In spontaneously hypertensive rats single doses of nitrendipine (1.25 to 5.0 mg/kg per os) and enalapril (0.3 and 3.0 mg/kg per os) reduced mean arterial pressure, but differences were observed in the onset (enalapril 2 h versus nitrendipine 0.5 h), the duration of action, and magnitude of effect. In terms of blood pressure lowering, nitrendipine, 5.0 mg/kg per os, was clearly additive to 3.0 mg/kg per os of enalapril, but other combinations (enalapril, 3 mg/kg per os plus 0.625 mg/kg of nitrendipine or enalapril, 0.3 mg/kg per os plus 0.625 mg/kg nitrendipine) were not.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "111": "Cilazapril is a new angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor. In conscious renal-hypertensive dogs, cilazapril (2 X 10 mg/kg/day p.o.) caused a long-lasting (greater than 24 h) decrease in systolic arterial blood pressure, the magnitude of which was potentiated by pretreatment with furosemide. A maximal fall in systolic blood pressure of 39 +/- 6 mm Hg (from 145 +/- 5 to 106 +/- 7 mm Hg) was recorded. The antihypertensive effect did not decline with repeated administration and was accompanied by only a slight increase in heart rate. Cilazapril also reduced systolic blood pressure in furosemide-pretreated normotensive dogs. Hemodynamic studies in anesthetized dogs revealed that cilazapril (0.03-1 mg/kg i.v.) caused a fall in mean arterial and left ventricular systolic pressures. At the highest dose of 1 mg/kg i.v., the blood-pressure-lowering effect (-27%) was due to a decrease in total peripheral resistance (-12%) and cardiac output (-16%). Intravenous administration of cilazapril to anesthetized dogs resulted in a rise in plasma renin activity and a significant fall in plasma angiotensin II levels. In conscious normotensive dogs, cilazapril (0.3-10 mg/kg p.o.) exerted diuretic and saluretic effects, which were accompanied by a significant increase in renal plasma flow (46%), but only a slight rise in the glomerular filtration rate. These results characterize cilazapril as an effective and long-lasting antihypertensive drug, with diuretic activity and, possibly, preload- as well as afterload-reducing properties.", 
    "112": "We investigated whether captopril, an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, would reduce proteinuria in patients with advanced diabetic nephropathy. Captopril (37.5 mg given in divided doses three times daily) was administered to 10 azotemic diabetics with heavy proteinuria. Urinary protein decreased promptly within two weeks (from 10.6 +/- 2.2 to 6.1 +/- 1.4 g per day [mean +/- S.E.M.]; P less than 0.01). The decrease in proteinuria did not coincide with a fall in systemic blood pressure or in the blood glucose concentration. Serum creatinine and potassium values did not change in any of the patients except one. We suggest that captopril caused a decrease in intrarenal hypertension, which contributed to the reduction of urinary protein excretion. The therapeutic value of this intervention remains to be established.", 
    "113": "The treatment of chronic congestive heart failure relies on positive inotropic, diuretic, venous and arterial vasodilating drugs. Several factors are involved in the physiopathology of chronic congestive heart failure such as venous and arterial vasoconstriction mediated by the adrenergic system and/or the renin-angiotensin system which increases concomitantly the extracellular volume. These factors are initially compensatory of the low-cardiac output, but aggravate the heart failure on a long-term and are the basis for the use of vasodilating drugs and diuretics. Among vasodilating drugs the converting enzyme inhibitors are of special interest since they inhibit the renin-angiotensin system which is directly involved in the physiopathology of heart failure. On the other hand, they act both as venous and as arterial vasodilators and are generally better tolerated than pure venous or pure arterial vasodilating drugs. They are also better tolerated than the oral inotropic drugs commonly used (mainly digitalis) whose efficacy is controversial in patients being in sinus rhythm. The use of converting enzyme inhibitors, which is now restricted to the more severe cases of chronic heart failure, may be enlarged in the future to the first steps of heart failure, especially if a beneficial effect of these drugs on the long term survey may be proved.", 
    "114": "The cardiac output and its peripheral distribution must fulfill the metabolic and/or functional requirements of the different organs. The various techniques used to measure blood flow rates in the coronary and renal arteries provide much information on this point, but they do not tell us all we would like to know about the distribution and \"utilization\" of these flows in tissues. In normal subjects the myocardial oxygen consumption is not markedly different from the renal oxygen consumption, but the mechanisms that regulate the coronary and renal circulations are not the same. The flow rate in the coronary vessels is about 10% of the cardiac output, the arteriovenous oxygen gradient is superior to 10 vol % and regulation is metabolic. In the renal vessels, which are primarily \"functional\", the flow rate is about 25% of the cardiac output and the arteriovenous oxygen gradient is inferior to 2 vol %. In heart failure patients, despite reduced cardiac output the blood pressure is kept normal for a long time by vasoconstriction of the arterioles, a process which involves, at least partly, the renin-angiotensin system. The vasoconstriction predominates in some circuits (the renal flow rate is less than 15% of the cardiac output) and spares the \"privileged\" circuits (the coronary flow rate is more than 15% of the cardiac output). Under the influence of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, the cardiac output increases and its distribution is modified. The coronary flow rate remains stable or is reduced in proportion to the decrease in myocardial oxygen consumption, the metabolic regulation is preserved and there is no \"coronary steal\". The percent increase in renal flow rate is usually superior to that of the cardiac output. This peripheral redistribution of coronary and renal blood flow rates in heart failure patients after treatment with converting enzyme inhibitors seems to correspond to the physiological purposes of the two regional blood flows.", 
    "115": "Up to now, the experiments carried out throughout the world with enalapril have been most encouraging. The drug gives good, even excellent responses in 54 to 66 % of patients with essential hypertension, and it is at least as effective as diuretics and beta-blockers. Compared with those of diuretics, the effects of enalapril confirm that the best responders are those patients who are most dependent on the renin-angiotensin system. When a diuretic is administered concomitantly with enalapril, almost all patients respond and the therapeutic effect is well maintained in long term. Blocadren or alpha-methyldopa can be added to hydrochlorothiazide, thus providing additional benefits to patients with severe hypertension. Enalapril reduces the undesirable metabolic effects of hydrochlorothiazide, particularly hypokalaemia. Altogether, enalapril and captopril have similar effectiveness, but enalapril is better tolerated and does not seem to produce the side-effects encountered with captopril, notably skin rashes and ageusia. As expected, enalapril and other angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may be associated with azotaemia in patients with bilateral renovascular hypertension.", 
    "116": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness and safety of enalapril in elderly people. A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was carried out in 32 subjects aged from 75 to 97 years (mean: 86 years) with blood pressure values equal or superior to 160/90 mmHg. After 8 weeks of treatment with enalapril in doses of 20 to 40 mg/day, the systolic pressure was lowered from 190 +/- 16 to 151 +/- 19 mmHg (P less than 0.0001) and the diastolic pressure from 102 +/- 7 to 85 +/- 11 mmHg (P less than 0.0001). Systolic and diastolic pressures were also significantly reduced in subjects under placebo (from 183 +/- 16 to 165 +/- 21 mmHg, P less than 0.001; and from 101 +/- 9 to 91 +/- 13 mmHg, P less than 0.001, respectively), but the degree of reduction was significantly superior with enalapril (systolic: 39 +/- 25 vs 18 +/- 19 mmHg, P less than 0.005; diastolic: 17 +/- 13 vs 11 +/- 12, P less than 0.001); blood pressure was inferior to 160/90 mmHg in 67% of the subjects treated, as against 35% of those under placebo. Two patients under enalapril died: one on the 27th, the other on the 47th day of treatment. No relation could be established between these deaths and the drug, and this figure of 2 is not significantly different for the number of deaths expected over the same period in a population of that age-group. Among the patients under placebo, one had pulmonary embolism on the 34th day and another had a sudden increase in blood pressure on the 6th day, requiring discontinuation of treatment. It is concluded that enalapril administered alone is effective and well tolerated. Long-term studies are needed to find out whether this angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor is superior to a diuretic as initial treatment of arterial hypertension.", 
    "117": "The fall in cardiac output observed in cardiac failure induces stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. This results in strong constriction of the arterioles which in turn increases the fall in cardiac output and aggravates myocardial alteration. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors therefore act on a major physiological mechanism of cardiac failure. In this double-blind study 36 cardiac failure patients treated with digitalis derivatives and diuretics were divided into two groups: one group received enalapril in addition to the other drugs, the other group received a placebo. The functional symptoms, exercise tests, left ventricular function and haemodynamic values were improved in two-thirds of the patients treated with enalapril, whereas no improvement was observed in those who received the placebo. Enalapril maleate was given by injection to 10 patients with acute left ventricular failure following myocardial infarction; a useful fall in pulmonary capillary pressure and systemic arterial resistance occurred within one hour. Enalapril represents an effective physiopathological treatment of severe cardiac failure.", 
    "118": "Enalapril is an inhibitor of the converting enzyme which transforms angiotensin I into angiotensin II, an octapeptide with pharmacological properties uniformly tending to increase blood pressure. The enalapril molecule is not active until it has been hydrolyzed into enalaprilic acid in the liver. This acid induces a very strong (85-95%), very early (maximum at 2 hours) and long lasting (20% at 72 hours) blockade of the angiotensin-converting enzyme, resulting in a paralleled fall in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The fall begins with a 2.5 mg dose of the drug, is maximum with 10 mg and is not increased by higher doses. No tachyphylaxis has been observed with prolonged administration. The fall in blood pressure is due to reduction of peripheral resistance, without changes in heart rate and cardiac output. There is no sodium retention. The two main pharmacokinetic features of the drug are its very long half-life and the 100% urinary excretion of the active metabolite. The drug can be taken as a single dose at any moment of the day. The only known interaction is with propranolol, which reduces by one-third the bioavailability of enalapril. Side-effects are uncommon and mild.", 
    "119": "The treatment of arterial hypertension in diabetic patients still raises numerous problems. In this type of patients, the most commonly prescribed drugs (beta-blockers, diuretics, antihypertensive agents acting on the central nervous system) have troublesome and potentially detrimental effects (e.g. effects on lipids). The new categories of antihypertensive drugs recently introduced (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium antagonists) are likely to be most useful in these patients. In an open trial in non-insulin-dependent diabetics with arterial hypertension followed-up for 1 year, enalapril administered alone has proved effective and devoid of clinical and biochemical side-effects. If these results are confirmed, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors will rank high as first-choice treatment of arterial hypertension in diabetics.", 
    "120": "The tripeptide Tyr-Gly-Gly, a hydrolysis product of enkephalins and related opioid peptides obtained with 'enkephalinase', was identified and quantified in various regions of mouse brain by means of HPLC and a sensitive and specific radioimmunoassay. Similar levels i.e. about 8 pmol/brain were found after the animals were killed by various procedures, including microwave irradiation, suggesting its pre-mortem formation. The distribution of Tyr-Gly-Gly immunoreactivity among brain regions was highly heterogeneous and paralleled to a certain extent the [Met5]enkephalin distribution, molar levels of Tyr-Gly-Gly representing 10-30% of those of the enkephalin. Following gentle homogeneisation of striata in 0.32 M sucrose and centrifugation, 73% of Tyr-Gly-Gly immunoreactivity was recovered in the supernatant, a result consistent with its extracellular localisation in vivo. Administration of enkephalinase inhibitors rapidly elicited marked decrease in Tyr-Gly-Gly immunoreactivity whereas bestatin, an aminopeptidase inhibitor, elicited 100% increase and captopril, an ACE inhibitor, was without significant effect. These data indicate that the tripeptide is in a dynamic state in the brain and that its levels might reflect the release of endogenous enkephalins or related opioid peptides and their subsequent metabolism by enkephalinase.", 
    "121": "The effect of additional administration of a low dose of an ACE inhibitor when blood pressure is inadequately controlled by a diuretic alone was investigated in 12 essential hypertensive patients. 24 h blood pressure monitorings were performed with portable automatic recording devices before and after treatment with 50 mg hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) and after additional administration of 25 mg captopril. The frequency of blood pressure readings exceeding 160/95 mm Hg within 24 hours was reduced in 11 of the 12 patients after administration of the ACE inhibitor. Mean blood pressure during daytime was 158 +/- 13 / 100 +/- 8 mm Hg without treatment, 151 +/- 11 / 93 +/- 8 mm Hg during HCT alone and 140 +/- 13 / 88 +/- 9 mm Hg during HCT + captopril. The results show that in a large proportion of hypertensives inadequately controlled by a diuretic alone, the addition of a low dose of an ACE inhibitor (captopril, 25 mg once daily) may normalize the blood pressure.", 
    "122": "Angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitors cross the placenta and modify the maternal, foetal and utero-placental renin-angiotensin system. Eight cases of pregnancy in women taking captopril have been published, 7 other cases being reported in this review paper. There were one spontaneous and 2 therapeutic abortions, one of which disclosed a malformation of uncertain diagnosis and imputation. One intrauterine death at 28 weeks was probably due to the severity of the maternal disease. Two children born to mothers also treated with frusemide died of neonatal anuria. Delivery or caesarean section occurred before term in 8 cases, and there were 3 cases of neonatal respiratory distress with a favourable outcome. Finally, one mother gave birth at term to twins of normal weight. The cases with respiratory distress can be attributed to the mother's hypertension, to prematurity and/or to concomitant treatment with beta-blockers, while the cases with anuria seem to be due to inhibition of the effects of angiotensin on renal haemodynamics, with salt depression as a possible aggravating factor. Treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors does not seem to warrant therapeutic abortion. However, these drugs are contra-indicated in pregnancy and should only be given to women wishing to become pregnant if they present with resistant and dangerous arterial hypertension. A programme of pharmacovigilance is being set up to follow up such pregnancies.", 
    "123": "A method for the determination of SQ 27,519 (II), the active phosphinic acid-carboxylic acid of the prodrug SQ 28,555 (I), in human serum is presented. Compounds I and II are simultaneously extracted from acidified serum into ethyl acetate, and II is back-extracted into aqueous sodium bicarbonate. Compound I, in ethyl acetate, can be subsequently hydrolyzed and measured as II. The two acidic groups of II are selectively esterified, first by methylation of the carboxylic acid with methanolic hydrochloric acid and then by formation of the hexafluoroisopropyl ester of the phosphinic acid. The resulting product is measured by splitless-injection capillary gas chromatography with nitrogen-phosphorus detection. Linear standard curves were obtained for II with a detection limit of less than 10 ng/ml of serum. The method was successfully applied to the analysis of serum samples obtained from normal individuals after administration of I. In an ascending-dose study involving several human subjects the serum levels of II ranged from less than 10 to 7000 ng/ml of serum.", 
    "124": "Beginning in the early 1950s, when a ganglioplegic agent and a vasodilator were used in combination to provide long-term control of severe hypertension, which neither drug alone could control, much has been learned about the management of hypertension from the use of new antihypertensive agents in man and from clinical trials of antihypertensive regimens. Some of this information includes: the unexpected yet very real hazards as well as benefits associated with the long-term use of powerful drugs, in particular the original description of hydralazine-induced lupus, its relation to genetic markers and its association with control of hypertension; the apparently decreasing need for antihypertensive drugs in subjects with well-controlled severe and moderate hypertension; the identification of risk factors for the complications of hypertension and the quantitation of their effects; the decrease in the incidence of hypertensive complications associated with the pharmacologic treatment of severe, moderate and, at least, the upper ranges of mild hypertension; the possibility of designing a chemical to block a specific reaction and the realization that it would have broader than expected effects; and the primary prevention of myocardial infarction in very high risk subjects.", 
    "125": "The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system regulates blood pressure and volume homeostasis in addition to sodium and potassium metabolism, and may be linked to divalent cation metabolism as well as hypertensive disease. In essential hypertension, circulating serum magnesium and Ca++, and the calcium regulating hormones, parathyroid hormone, calcitonin and 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin (1,25D) are different in the various renin subgroups. Elevated blood pressure induced by such maneuvers as dietary salt loading is associated with exacerbations of these calcium metabolic deviations, and appears related to salt-induced changes in serum Ca++ or 1,25D levels. Short- or longer-term lowering of blood pressure with the calcium-channel blocker, nifedipine, or with calcium or magnesium supplementation is associated with a shift of renin system activity and calcium metabolic indexes back to average normotensive values in those subjects most susceptible to these hypotensive agents. These observations suggest that deviations in calcium metabolism in essential hypertension may be related to the pathophysiology of the hypertensive process. Further, renin system activity and calcium metabolic indexes such as serum Ca++ levels may help target specific subgroups of hypertensive populations most susceptible to various dietary or drug maneuvers, and thus may provide a basis to better understand and treat clinical hypertension.", 
    "126": "Whether or not the kidney is involved in the genesis of hypertension in an individual patient, it becomes a major determinant of the response to antihypertensive therapy once a treatment strategy is adopted. The major mechanisms through which the kidney influences blood pressure are renin release and sodium retention, either together or separately, but additional mechanisms may also contribute. When sodium intake is restricted or a diuretic is used, the reactive increase in plasma renin activity makes a substantial contribution to limiting the blood pressure fall. When vasodilators or agents that block the sympathetic nervous system are used, sodium retention plays an important role. Among newer agents, the effectiveness of calcium channel blockers, converting enzyme inhibitors and perhaps dopamine analogs reflects, for reasons that differ from 1 class of agent to another, a special action on the kidney that limits the reactive renal response to the reduction in blood pressure. Treatment strategies that address the problem of the renal response are more likely to be effective than approaches that avoid or ignore it.", 
    "127": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme was purified from human lung, kidney, testis, blood plasma, and seminal plasma using a facile two-step protocol which included affinity chromatography on Sepharose-bound lisinopril followed by either gel filtration or hydroxylapatite chromatography. Molecular mass for converting enzyme from all sources except testis was 140 kDa. That from testis consisted of both a 90- and a 140-kDa form in a 4:1 ratio. Detergent-extracted membrane-bound converting enzyme aggregated on gel filtration chromatography, while trypsin-extracted and soluble converting enzyme did not. Comparison of detergent-extracted and trypsin-extracted membrane-bound converting enzyme by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing indicated that the membrane binding sequence contributed minimally to the size and charge of the enzyme. Catalytic and kinetic properties assessed by interaction with substrates, inhibitors, and anti-converting enzyme immunoglobulin were similar for all forms and sources of converting enzyme. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay revealed only partial homology between the 90- and 140-kDa forms of the enzyme.", 
    "128": "The effect of the converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (5 mg (kg bwt)-1) on systemic and renal haemodynamics has been studied in conscious rats in which a progressive hypertension has been induced by progressive aortic ligation (AL) between the renal arteries, and in a sham-operated (SO) group. Cardiac output (CO), organ blood flow and vascular resistances have been measured using radioactive microsphaeres. Captopril infusion caused increases in CO in both groups of rats, but the increase was higher in SO (9.2 +/- 0.7%) than in AL rats (5.2 +/- 0.6%; P less than 0.005). Plasma renin concentrations were similar in both groups but increased more in AL (10.3 microIU +/- 1.0) than in SO (5.81 microIU +/- 0.62; P less than 0.05) after captopril. Captopril induced also a larger decrease in arterial pressure (36 +/- 4 mmHg), and of the pressure gradient across the stenosis (19 +/- 3) mmHg in AL than in SO rats (5.6 +/- 1.4 and 1.1 +/- 1.3 mmHg, P less than 0.005 for both cases). Vascular resistance of the kidney above the ligature decreased more in AL than in SO rats, but this difference was not observed in the other kidney. From these data it can be concluded that captopril has an acute hypotensive effect despite the normal renin levels of this model of chronic hypertension. In addition, blood flow to the high-pressure perfused kidney seems to be dependent on the increased renin production by the contralateral kidney.", 
    "129": "A case of juxtaglomerular tumour (sometimes called hemangiopericytoma) in a 17 year old boy, presenting with severe hypertension and hypokalemia, is described. Plasma renin activity was markedly elevated in both renal veins and failed to lateralise the tumour. This is attributed to chronic stimulation of renin secretion by Captopril treatment. Removal of the tumour cured the hypertension and hypokalemia.", 
    "130": "This paper examined whether drinking elicited by morphine is dependent upon an intact renin-angiotensin system. Bilateral nephrectomy, carried out one day prior to administration of morphine, completely abolished morphine-induced water intake, pointing to involvement of the kidneys in the dipsogenic effect of morphine. Plasma and renal renin depletion were induced by the clipping of one renal artery followed, one month later, by removal of the clipped kidney. In such renin-depleted rats with subnormal plasma renin levels, morphine and isoprenaline-induced water intakes were linearly related to pre-injection basal plasma renin level. Such a relationship was not found in rats with normal renin levels. These results pointed to the existence of a permissive interaction between morphine and the renin-angiotensin system. Captopril, an inhibitor of the angiotensin converting enzyme, increased morphine-induced water intake. We interpreted this drinking response as being the sum of morphine-induced drinking (following a permissive interaction between morphine and circulating angiotensin I or renin) and captopril-induced drinking (following a captopril-induced increase in circulating renin and angiotensin I levels). The competitive antagonist of angiotensin II, saralasin, had no effect on morphine-induced drinking. This result pointed once again to a permissive interaction between morphine and circulating angiotensin I or renin.", 
    "131": "Deep-body or core temperature decreases during exercise in patients with heart failure, primarily due to the circulatory inadequacies associated with the pathophysiology of this condition. Vasodilators are commonly used to treat patients suffering from heart failure because these drugs improve total cardiac output and blood-flow to the regional circulations. In heart failure patients, the core temperature response to exercise should also be affected if the circulation is improved by vasodilators. Patients with severe heart failure were studied at rest and during upright bicycle exercise before, and after, short-term treatment with vasodilators (2-minoxidil, 3-hydralazine, 5-captopril). Their heart rate increased significantly (P less than 0.05) from rest to exercise before (87 +/- 15 109 +/- 14 beats/min), and after 89 +/- 13- 112 +/- 15 beats/min) vasodilators, but there was no drug-related affect on these changes. Mean arterial and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures were significantly (P less than 0.05) decreased at rest and after the administration of vasodilators (mean arterial pressure 88 +/- 7 mmHg before; 77 +/- 8 mmHg after; pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 25 +/- 8 mmHg before, 19 +/- 9 mmHg after). During exercise, the increases in mean arterial and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures were not significantly different from the before vasodilator values (mean arterial pressure 92 +/- 14 mmHg before, 87 +/- 14 mmHg after; pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 31 +/- 11 mmHg before, 29 +/- 11 mmHg after). Vasodilators increased cardiac output significantly (P less than 0.05) at rest (3.1 +/- 0.6 litre/min to 4.1 +/- 1.1 litre/m) and during exercise (4.8 +/- .2 litre/min-5.6 +/- 1.7 litre/min). The core temperature (mixed venous blood temperature) decreased significantly (P less than 0.05) during exercise from 37.04 +/- 0.62 degrees C to 36.65 +/- 0.65 degrees C, before treatment with vasodilators. After administration of vasodilators, resting core temperature was not significantly different (36.95 +/- 0.54 degrees C) and still decreased significantly (P less than 0.05) during exercise to 36.73 +/- 0.53 degrees C. This decrease was significantly (P less than 0.05) different from the core temperature response before the administration of vasodilators. We conclude that heart failure patients, treated with short-term vasodilators, have an attenuation of the core temperature response that typically occurs during exercise. This change in the core temperature response is the result of the vasodilator-induced improvement in circulation.", 
    "132": "In perfused human umbilical arteries both angiotensin I and II induced vasoconstriction with a monophasic response. Angiotensin I and II induced vasoconstrictions at doses greater than or equal to 10(-8) M and 10(-9) M respectively. Captopril inhibited the angiotensin I response while the angiotensin II receptor blocker Sar1-Ala8 AII inhibited the effect of both angiotensins. PGI2 attenuated the angiotensin II response in a dose dependent pattern. PGE2 and PGF2 alpha in concentrations below the critical levels for creating pressure responses per se, also attenuated the angiotensin II response. The cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin potentiated the angiotensin II response indicating that endogenous production of prostanoids is of importance in the modulation of angiotensin effects.", 
    "133": "To evaluate the effects of pharmacologic vasodilatation on glycerol-induced acute renal failure, we studied untreated animals and those given Captopril and Diltiazem at periods ranging from 30 minutes to four weeks after the onset of acute renal failure. At each time frame, comparative coded assessments of renal function, histology, and microangiography were performed. Diltiazem, a calcium channel blocker, significantly reduced the severity of the renal failure, decreased the extent of tubular cell necrosis, and was associated with a more rapid histologic and functional recovery. Captopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, did not influence renal function or pathology throughout the four-week observation period. Microangiography revealed marked differences among the experimental groups. Most notably, there was better visualization of the microvasculature in Diltiazem-treated kidneys at one and two weeks. However, at four weeks, all groups showed similar, severe microangiographic abnormalities. Diltiazem offers significant protection against glycerol-induced acute renal failure in rats. Its mechanism of action in this context remains unknown. Renal function and pathology do not correlate well with microangiographic perfusion patterns in this model of acute renal failure.", 
    "134": "Rats were placed on either a low sodium intake (low sodium diet 0.025% dry weight, tap water for drinking) or a high sodium intake (normal sodium diet 0.45% dry weight, 0.9% saline for drinking) for 10 days. The pressor-response curve to angiotensin II in rats previously on a high sodium intake was shifted to the left of that found in rats previously on a low sodium intake. Suppression of endogenous angiotensin II formation with captopril (0.3 mg kg-1) or acute volume repletion (3% body wt per 30 min) resulted in a significant parallel shift of the pressor-response curve for angiotensin II to the left in the low salt group. In the high salt group captopril produced a similar but smaller parallel shift of the dose-response curve to the left. Similar manipulation of endogenous angiotensin II concentrations with high and low salt intake plus captopril treatment or acute volume repletion, produced no alterations in the pressor response for noradrenaline. The attenuated in vivo response to angiotensin II in the low salt intake group may be explained in part by the suppressed vascular sensitivity to angiotensin II in this group, as measured in the isolated perfused kidney of the rat. In kidneys from rats previously on a low sodium intake, an enhanced maximal vasoconstrictor response to noradrenaline was observed as compared to kidneys from high sodium intake rats. These results indicate that, whereas alterations in endogenous angiotensin II concentrations within physiological limits affects the response to exogenous angiotensin, there is little if any effect on the pressor response to noradrenaline.", 
    "135": "The role of the sympathetic nervous system, angiotensin II (ANG II), and arginine vasopressin (AVP) in maintaining blood pressure (BP) during endotoxic shock was investigated in 117 conscious male Wistar rats. After intravenous injection of 2 mg Escherichia coli endotoxin, mean BP fell within 5 min by approximately 50 mmHg and rose again to approach base-line levels within 90 min. At that time, plasma renin activity, plasma norepinephrine (NE), and vasopressin levels of the endotoxin-treated animals were, respectively, 12-, 10-, and 54-fold (P less than 0.001) higher than those of the controls. The BP effect of either prazosin (0.125 mg iv), captopril (2.5 mg iv), or d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)AVP (5 micrograms iv), a specific antagonist of the vascular effect of AVP, was evaluated over a 30-min observation period starting 90 min after administration of endotoxin or its vehicle. Captopril reduced mean BP from 116 +/- 1.8 to a low of 109 +/- 2.1 (SE) mmHg (P less than 0.05, n = 8) only in rats pretreated with endotoxin, whereas the vasopressin antagonist had no depressor effect even during endotoxemia. The BP drop induced by prazosin in rats exposed to endotoxin (-21 +/- 3.3 mmHg, n = 6) did not significantly differ from that observed in control rats (-14 +/- 3.4 mmHg, n = 6). A dose-response curve to NE, ANG II, and lysine vasopressin was also performed. In endotoxin-treated rats the mean BP response to all agonists was markedly suppressed (P less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "136": "A 61-year-old Chinese-American man with a history of congestive heart failure and hypertension was admitted to the San Francisco Veterans Administration Hospital with confusion, cortical blindness, and generalized flaccidity. Serum sodium level on admission was 114 meq/liter. Administration of captopril had been begun for afterload reduction two weeks before admission with a concomitant fall in serum sodium level from 137 meq/liter to 126 meq/liter in one week. A history of marked thirst with consumption of large volumes of water was reported for over one week prior to hospitalization. Despite correction of the hyponatremia within 24 hours at a rate of 0.9 meq/liter per hour, the patient remained semi-comatose and died four days later with a gastrointestinal bleed. It is suggested that the thirst phenomenon and hyponatremia were caused by the introduction of captopril. This lead to irreversible neurologic damage and death, despite the correction of the serum sodium level.", 
    "137": "Although there is growing evidence that angiotensin II affects macrophage-mediated inflammatory responses, it is unclear whether it can affect neutrophil-mediated inflammatory responses. Because vascular endothelial cells are capable of releasing neutrophil chemoattractant activity, we attempted to determine whether components of the angiotensin system could affect neutrophil-mediated responses indirectly by stimulating endothelial cells to release neutrophil chemoattractant substances. Cultured bovine and human endothelial cells incubated with angiotensin II released neutrophil chemoattractant activity. This activity appeared within 1 minute of exposure to angiotensin II, and was blocked by saralasin, an angiotensin II antagonist. Angiotensin I also caused release of neutrophil chemoattractant activity, but its effect required conversion to angiotensin II. Bradykinin, another substrate for angiotensin-converting enzyme, did not stimulate appearance of chemoattractant. Chemoattractant generation was not inhibited by indomethacin but was blocked by diethylcarbamazine and 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid. This study demonstrates that angiotensin II may influence neutrophil accumulation, via production of neutrophil chemoattractant activity by vascular endothelial cells.", 
    "138": "A sensitive technique allowing to identify the three genotypes (AceSS, AceRR and AceRS) of the Ace gene existing in natural populations of Culex pipiens in southern France is described. The technique is based on the comparison of AChE (acetylcholinesterase) activity in 3 equal aliquots taken from the homogenate of a single mosquito (a) in absence of inhibitor (RA), (b) in presence of eserine that inhibits the AChE encoded by AceS and AceR alleles (RI) and (c) in presence of a concentration of propoxur inhibiting the AChE coded by the AceS allele but not by the AceR allele (RG). The mosquito tested is AceSS when RG = RI, AceRR when RG = RA and AceRS when RI less than RG less than RA.", 
    "139": "Mevinolin, a competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, stimulates neurite outgrowth and acetylcholinesterase (ACE) activity in C1300 (Neuro-2A) murine neuroblastoma cells. Sprouting of neurites began within 4-8 h, before changes in cell proliferation could be detected by [3H]thymidine incorporation or flow cytometry. In contrast, the increase in ACE activity was temporally correlated with suppression of DNA synthesis, which occurred after 8 h. The activity of the membrane marker enzyme phosphodiesterase I was not stimulated by mevinolin. Suppression of protein synthesis with cycloheximide blocked the induction of ACE activity but only partially inhibited neurite outgrowth in the mevinolin-treated cultures. When mevinolin was removed from the culture medium, most of the cells retracted their neurites within 2 h, but ACE activity did not decline until DNA synthesis began to return to control levels after 10 h. Similarly, retraction of neurites in differentiated cells exposed to colchicine was not accompanied by a decrease in ACE activity. DNA histograms suggested that mevinolin arrests neuroblastoma cells in both the G1 and G2/M compartments of the cell cycle. Other cytostatic drugs that arrest cells at different stages of the cell cycle did not cause Neuro-2A cells to form neurites such as those seen in the mevinolin-treated cultures. When incorporation of [3H]acetate into isoprenoid compounds was studied in cultures containing mevinolin in concentrations ranging from 0.25 microM to 25 microM, the labeling of cholesterol, dolichol, and ubiquinone was suppressed by 90% or more at all concentrations. However, significant growth arrest and cell differentiation were observed only at the highest concentrations of mevinolin. Supplementing the medium with 100 microM mevalonate prevented the cellular response to mevinolin, but additions of cholesterol, dolichol, ubiquinone, or isopentenyl adenine were generally ineffective. The cholesterol content of neuroblastoma cells incubated with 25 microM mevinolin for 24 h was not diminished, and protein glycosylation, measured by [3H]mannose incorporation, was decreased only after 24 h at high mevinolin concentration. These studies suggest that the stimulation of neurite outgrowth and the increase in ACE activity induced by mevinolin are independent phenomena. Whereas neurite outgrowth is not related directly to the effects of mevinolin on cell cycling, the induction of ACE is correlated with the inhibition of cell proliferation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "140": "Worldwide experience with captopril and enalapril showed that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor monotherapy in hypertensive patients rarely caused renal dysfunction. The ACE inhibitors in combination with potent vasodilating drugs and diuretics may produce sudden systemic normotension or hypotension that may impair glomerular filtration at reduced renal perfusion pressure. Reversible renal insufficiency developed during the 13th week of hydrochlorothiazide-enalapril-alpha methyldopa therapy in patient 1 and during the 6th week of hydrochlorothiazide-enalapril treatment in patient 2. Systemic hypotension in patient 1 and routine biochemical monitoring in patient 2 was the first clue of renal insufficiency. Renal angiography was normal in both patients. Renal insufficiency resolved after stopping all drugs temporarily and did not recur on other antihypertensive drug regimens. These data suggested the importance of systemic arterial blood pressure as the best clinical determinant of renal function in hypertensive patients receiving an ACE inhibitor in combination with other antihypertensive agents.", 
    "141": "A highly sensitive assay for angiotensin I converting enzyme has been developed by using angiotensin I as a substrate. Angiotensin II generated in the reaction mixture was measured by a newly developed specific radioimmunoassay. To protect against angiotensin II destruction, bestatin, an inhibitor of renin, was also used to inhibit plasma renin activity. The reaction was stopped by adding EDTA and MK-521, inhibitors of angiotensin I converting enzyme. The specificity of the antiserum used for the angiotensin II radioimmunoassay was very high. The cross reactivity with angiotensin I was less than 0.5% and none of the proteolytic enzyme inhibitors crossreacted in the assay. The inhibitory effect of pepstatin on plasma renin activity was very high (more than 80%) under the standard assay conditions employed. Serum angiotensinase activity was completely inhibited by the addition of bestatin. An excellent correlation was obtained between this new method and the spectrophotometric method using a synthetic substrate, Hip-His-Leu. The generation of as little as 12 pM of Angiotensin II can be detected. Such low concentration have not been measurable with the usual spectrophotometric method. This new method will facilitate clinical and experimental studies on this unique enzyme, since very low levels of activity can be determined by this highly sensitive radioimmunoassay for angiotensin II.", 
    "142": "To understand the in vivo actions of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, a prolonged study was performed in rabbits over a half year, using one of such inhibitors, foroxymithine. During the initial 2 months of the inhibitor administration, the serum level of ACE was suppressed. Thereafter, probably triggered by the consequent sharp rise in the plasma renin activity (PRA) level, the ACE level regained its initial value. Thus the close correlation between the levels of PRA and ACE seen in the control animal was entirely broken by this inhibitor. A multivariate study indicated that the inhibitor drastically changed the normal networks of peptide metabolism in vivo. These results are compatible with the notion that the ACE inhibitor blocks the regulatory mechanisms of the renin-angiotensin system in vivo.", 
    "143": "The effect of sustained converting enzyme (CE) inhibition on modest levels of exercise performance was investigated using German Shepherds. The dogs were trained to run on an inclined treadmill and to tolerate repeated jugular venous puncture. The effects of exercise were assessed by monitoring heart rate and respiratory rate and plasma catecholamine- and serum electrolyte concentrations on each of two control runs. Plasma CE- and renin activity were also determined. Inhibition of CE-activity was established thereafter by high dose treatment with 10 mg/kg Hoe 498 p.o. once daily for one week and the run repeated. These large doses of Hoe 498 were well tolerated. Neither running performance nor cardiorespiratory responses were altered by CE-inhibition. Plasma K+ and catecholamines were taken as measures of peripheral sympathetic activity, and CE-inhibition did not alter the increase in either of these in response to exercise. It is concluded that converting enzyme inhibition with Hoe 498 does not impair exercise performance despite any direct effects the loss of angiotensin II may have on reflex sympathetic functions.", 
    "144": "Stimulation of the renal sympathetic nerves in pentobarbitone anaesthetized rats achieved a 13% reduction in renal blood flow, did not change glomerular filtration rate, but reduced urine flow by 37%, absolute sodium excretion by 37%, and fractional sodium excretion by 34%. Following inhibition of converting enzyme with captopril (0.38 mmol kg-1 h-1), similar nerve stimulation reduced both renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate by 16%, and although urine flow and absolute sodium excretion fell by 32 and 31%, respectively, the 18% fall in fractional sodium excretion was significantly less than that observed in the absence of captopril. Renal nerve stimulation at low levels, which did not change either renal blood flow or glomerular filtration rate, reduced urine flow, and absolute and fractional sodium excretions by 25, 26 and 23%, respectively. In animals receiving captopril at 0.38 mmol kg-1 h-1, low-level nerve stimulation caused small increases in glomerular filtration rate of 7% and urine flow of 12%, but did not change either absolute or fractional sodium excretions. At one-fifth the dose of captopril (0.076 mmol kg-1 h-1), low-level nerve stimulation did not change renal haemodynamics but decreased urine flow, and absolute and fractional sodium excretions by 10, 10 and 8%, respectively. These results showed that angiotensin II production was necessary for regulation of glomerular filtration rate in the face of modest neurally induced reductions in renal blood flow and was compatible with an intra-renal site of action of angiotensin II preferentially at the efferent arteriole. They also demonstrated that in the rat the action of the renal nerves to decrease sodium excretion was dependent on angiotensin II.", 
    "145": "The large arteries are impaired in uncomplicated, permanent, essential arterial hypertension. The peripheral arteries such as the humeral artery or the common carotid artery have a normal or increased diameter, reduced blood flow and, especially, reduced compliance. Reduction of the arterial compliance reflects an impairment peculiar to the large blood vessels, independent of the pressure. Antihypertensive medicines, for a given drop in pressure, may increase, diminish or not change arterial compliance. This is an important point to be taken into account in relation to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality of treated hypertensives. It has been particularly well studied in the context of inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "146": "To evaluate the role of angiotensin II (ANG II) in renal vasoconstriction due to ipsilateral CPUO, guinea pigs were subjected to incomplete left ureteral stenosis within the first 48 hr of life, and were given enalapril from the 14th day of life until study at 23 +/- 3 days or 8 weeks of age. Renal blood flow (RBF) was measured using radioactive microspheres, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was derived from inulin extraction. The number of perfused glomeruli per kidney was determined following in vivo India ink perfusion. Enalapril treatment resulted in an 83% rise in RBF of the obstructed kidney, from 2.58 +/- 0.26 to 4.73 +/- 0.48 ml/min (P less than 0.001), which was associated with a 26% increase in number of perfused glomeruli (P less than 0.01). Mean GFR of the hydronephrotic kidney increased from 0.13 +/- 0.02 to 0.37 +/- 0.10 ml/min (P less than 0.05). Enalapril had no effect on intraureteral pressure of the obstructed left kidney after 7 to 13 days of administration, and did not affect renal mass or ureteral diameter after 6 weeks of treatment. It is concluded that hemodynamic consequences of CPUO in the neonate may be attenuated by ANG converting enzyme inhibition. The primary effect of enalapril is most likely inhibition of intrarenal ANG II formation.", 
    "147": "The effect on blood pressure (BP) of acute and chronic suppression of angiotensin (ANG) II was studied in the two-kidney, one clip hypertensive rat. Conscious, chronically catheterized rats were given a bolus injection of captopril (2.5 mg/kg) followed by a chronic infusion of either dextrose or captopril (1 mg/kg per h) lasting 5 days. Blood pressure was measured continuously by a computer technique. Following the acute injection of captopril, arterial BP fell from 165.1 +/- 19.4 mmHg (mean +/- s.d.) to a minimum of 137.6 +/- 23.3 mmHg after 15 min. Twelve hours after starting the chronic infusion of captopril, BP fell to a minimum of 112.5 +/- 19.4 mmHg. This was significantly lower than that after the acute injection of captopril. Blood pressure remained lower throughout the 5-day infusion ranging, on the 5th day, from 122.1 +/- 23.4 to 136.0 +/- 30.2 mmHg. In contrast, BP continued to rise in rats given dextrose chronically ranging, on the 5th day, from 163.6 +/- 23.8 to 180.4 +/- 22.5 mmHg. Both the fall in pressure after acute captopril and that after chronic captopril were related to pre-treatment levels of plasma renin concentration. These results suggest that in the two-kidney, one clip hypertensive rat ANG II, in addition to its acute vasoconstrictor property, contribute to the hypertension through a secondary effect, the mechanism of which is as yet uncertain.", 
    "148": "The effects of intracisternal injection of enalapril (MK 421) or its bioactive form enalaprilic acid (MK 422) (0.075 mg/kg) on the pressor responses elicited by afferent stimulation of the vagus were investigated in the urethane-anaesthetized dog. The angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI)-induced decrease in the systolo-diastolic pressor responses to vagal stimulation was reversed by naloxone (0.1 mg/kg iv). These data support evidence for an additional central site of action of These data support evidence for an additional central site of action of ACEI and suggest the involvement of central opioid mechanisms in the hypotensive properties of ACEI.", 
    "149": "The proteolytic degradation of the enkephalin-containing heptapeptide Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Met-Arg-Phe (YGGFMRF) was investigated by incubating the peptide with synaptic membranes from mouse whole brain and characterizing the formed products. The degradation products were derivatized with 4-dimethylaminoazobenzene-4'-isothiocyanate and then analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography and by amino-terminal analysis. The incubation of YGGFMRF with synaptic membranes yielded YGGFM and RF as the degradation products. The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, MK-422 and captopril, potently inhibited the formation of YGGFM and RF with IC50 values of 8 nM and 95 nM, respectively. The \"enkephalinase A\" inhibitor, thiorphan, weakly inhibited this dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase activity with an IC50 greater than 1 microM. YGGFMRF, MK-422, captopril, and thiorphan all produced a dose-dependent analgesic response in the mouse hot plate test when administered intracerebroventricularly. However, when subanalgesic doses of inhibitors were co-administered with a subanalgesic dose of YGGFMRF, only the ACE inhibitors, MK-422 and captopril, potentiated the analgesic response of the peptide. These data provide in vitro and in vivo evidence that ACE is the primary enzyme involved in the proteolytic degradation of YGGFMRF in the mouse brain.", 
    "150": "The present study was designed to examine the effects of two different converting enzyme inhibitors on regional hemodynamics in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats. Rats were chronically instrumented with miniaturized pulsed Doppler flow probes for measurement of renal, mesenteric and hindquarters blood flow. Equidepressor doses of captopril (10 mg/kg) or a potent new converting enzyme inhibitor, Wy-44,221 [(-)-(S)-2,3-dihydro-1-[(S)-3-mercapto-2-methyl-1-oxypropyl]-1 H-indoline-2-carboxylic acid] (2 mg/kg) were administered by i.a. bolus injection. The converting enzyme inhibitors caused a reduction in mean arterial pressure, which was accompanied by a tachycardia. Renal blood flow was significantly increased by approximately 30 to 37% within 5 min after administration of the converting enzyme inhibitors, and renal vascular resistance was reduced. The renal hemodynamic effects were sustained for the 45-min duration of the experiment. Pretreatment with an angiotensin II receptor antagonist markedly attenuated the renal vasodilator effects of Wy-44,221, whereas antagonism of kinin or prostaglandin synthesis failed to diminish the renal effects of Wy-44,221. Both converting enzyme inhibitors also caused a significant but transient reduction in mesenteric vascular resistance, but had no significant effect on hindquarter hemodynamics. These data indicated that the converting enzyme inhibitors in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats caused a prolonged increase in renal blood flow as a result of removing the renal vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin II. These data further suggest that converting enzyme inhibitors exerted graded actions on regional vascular resistance with renal greater than mesenteric greater than hindquarters dilation.", 
    "151": "Alterations in the urinary excretion rate of kallikrein (UKKV) have frequently been assumed to reflect alterations in the intrarenal generation of kinins. Since other factors such as urinary pH and the activity of renal kininases may affect the intrarenal concentration of kinins, we investigated the effect of urinary alkalinization on kinin excretion in the presence and absence of kininase II inhibition. Urine was collected from the ureters of rats during control (ctl) (0.15 M NaCl infusion) and experimental (exp) periods. During exp periods, group I (time control) was infused with 0.15 M NaCl, group II with 0.3 M NaCl, and groups III and IV with 0.3 M NaHCO3, all at 0.12 ml/min. Prior to the ctl period, group IV was pretreated with the kininase II inhibitor captopril (40 mg/kg). During the exp period, urinary kinin excretion (UKiV) increased significantly in all groups ([exp - ctl] UKiV = 21 +/- 7, 27 +/- 9, 52 +/- 14, and 70 +/- 9 pg X min-1 X kg-1 in groups I, II, III, and IV, respectively). Urinary pH increased significantly in groups II, III, and IV. The increases in UKiV and pH were significantly greater in the bicarbonate-infused rats than in control. Partial correlation coefficients show that UKiV correlates with a high degree of significance only with urinary pH (r = 0.6). During the ctl period, UKiV in the captopril-pretreated rats was not different from that in other groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "152": "Fifteen patients who had undergone cardiac transplantation and who had hypertension (164 +/- 14/112 +/- 13 mm Hg), aged 16 to 57 years (mean 39), were treated with cyclosporine, 8 +/- 3 mg/kg/day, and prednisolone, 0.27 +/- 0.1 mg/kg/day, for 63 to 788 days (mean 288) after transplantation. They were not given antihypertensive drugs. Before treatment, the mean urinary sodium level was 104 +/- 48 mEq/day. Two discrete abnormalities accompanied their high blood pressure (BP): an increase in serum creatinine levels (p less than 0.05) to values exceeding those measured just before transplantation (2.1 +/- 1.0 vs 1.35 +/- 0.54 mg/dl) with low creatinine clearance (61 +/- 28 ml/min X 1.73 m2), and a 15% increase in plasma volume (+445 +/- 686 ml, p less than 0.02). Urinary excretion of vanilmandelic acid and total metanephrines was normal. Supine plasma renin activity was also normal (0.78 +/- 0.32 nmol/ml/hour). The stimulation of renin release after acute inhibition of converting enzyme by captopril was less marked than is usual in hypertensive subjects (0.86 +/- 0.54 nmol/liter/hour). Captopril induced a smaller drop in BP than nifedipine (-8 +/- 13/-6 +/- 10 mm Hg vs -14 +/- 11/-15 +/- 10 mm Hg). Levels of plasma aldosterone, angiotensinogen and converting enzyme activity were all normal, 308 +/- 147 pmol/liter, 712 +/- 164 nmol/ml and 30 +/- 6 mU/ml, respectively. It is concluded that hypertension is common in cardiac transplantation patients treated with cyclosporine, since 13 of our 15 subjects were normotensive before transplant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "153": "Enalapril maleate (MK-421), a nonmercapto-containing angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, is converted in vivo to enalaprilat (MK-422), the active diacid. We evaluated serum profiles and urinary excretion of oral enalapril maleate in patients with renal disease (group I, creatinine clearance less than 3 ml/min, patients undergoing dialysis, n = 10; group II, creatinine clearance 10 to 79 ml/min, n = 9) compared with healthy subjects (group III, creatinine clearance greater than 80 ml/min, n = 10). Group I received a 10 mg dose during a day while not receiving dialysis and a 10 mg dose 1 hour before dialysis 2 weeks later. Groups II and III received a single 10 mg dose. Blood samples and urine were collected for 48 hours. Impaired renal function resulted in elevated serum and plasma concentrations of enalapril maleate and decreased excretion rates and urinary recovery of enalapril maleate and enalaprilat. The data suggest an apparent increase in the extent of metabolism of enalapril maleate to enalaprilat or an increase in nonrenal elimination of unchanged enalapril maleate in renal disease compared with normal health. Enalaprilat was dialyzable.", 
    "154": "To assess the mechanism involved in hyperkalemia during angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition with captopril in chronic renal failure, captopril, 150 mg/day, was administered to 16 patients with hypertension with plasma creatinine levels between 1.6 and 12.4 mg/dl. After 4 weeks of therapy, plasma potassium levels increased from 3.9 +/- 0.1 to 5.5 +/- 0.2 mEq/L (P less than 0.001) and the final plasma potassium levels correlated with plasma creatinine levels (r = 0.67; P less than 0.01). In six patients with plasma creatinine levels greater than or equal to 3 mg/dl, aldosterone excretion decreased after 4 weeks of captopril, from 7.5 +/- 3.1 to 1.8 +/- 0.5 micrograms/24 hr, whereas plasma renin activity increased from 0.6 +/- 0.2 to 4.4 +/- 1.1 ng/ml/hr (P less than 0.05). This was associated with increases in plasma potassium levels from 3.9 +/- 0.2 to 5.4 +/- 0.4 mEq/L (P less than 0.005) and a significant reduction in fractional excretion of potassium from an average of 34% to 25%. No significant changes in plasma creatinine levels were observed during therapy. There was a significant positive correlation between aldosterone excretion and the potassium excretion fraction (r = 0.53; P less than 0.01). Increases in plasma potassium levels were not able to increase aldosterone excretion, although the greater the plasma potassium level attained, the smaller the reduction in aldosterone excretion (r = 0.47; P less than 0.05). Our results indicate that adequate aldosterone production is essential to preserve potassium homeostasis in chronic renal failure. Moreover, angiotensin II appears necessary for an adequate aldosterone response to potassium stimulation.", 
    "155": "Pharmacotherapeutical means of reversing cardiac hypertrophy (prazosin, clonidine and nifedipine) were analysed in concentrically, as well as eccentrically, hypertrophied left ventricles. Regression of cardiac hypertrophy, i.e. a therapeutic intervention on a critical precursor of hypertensive congestive heart failure, can be obtained by various antihypertensive agents. Prazosin, calcium channel blockers, clonidine and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors as well as a combined treatment regimen using alpha-receptor blockers together with diuretics and vasodilators can all induce regression of hypertrophy associated with an improvement in left ventricular function. Moreover, an improved coronary reserve may reduce the ischaemic risk of the hypertrophied myocardium. However, not all antihypertensive drugs seem equally effective in bringing about coronary regression of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). No regression or little regression has been found with diuretic monotherapy despite a satisfactory reduction in blood pressure. On the other hand, a trend towards a regression has been observed in patients in whom treatment with clonidine significantly reduced catecholamines.", 
    "156": "The demonstration that antihypertensive drug treatment reduces mortality and morbidity in mild hypertension has extended the indications for treatment. Verapamil, nitrendipine, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs are all equally effective in reducing blood pressure. The choice of drug depends on the presence or absence of specific contra-indications and the occurrence of side effects in individual patients.", 
    "157": "To investigate the renal actions of the converting enzyme inhibitor enalaprilic acid, incremental doses of this drug were infused into the renal artery of hypertensive patients just before renal angiography. One group (n = 6) received doses of 0.1, 0.3 and 1 microgram/kg per min, while in another group (n = 7) doses of 1, 3 and 10 micrograms/kg per min were given. Each dose was infused for 10 min, at the end of which renal blood flow was assessed by means of xenon-washout. At the same time, blood was sampled from the renal artery and vein for determination of converting enzyme, renin and angiotensin II. Enalaprilic acid caused a dose-related suppression of converting enzyme activity, which was maximal at a dose of 1 microgram/kg per min; arterial levels fell more steeply than venous ones. Angiotensin II disappeared in parallel with the drop in converting enzyme. Renal blood flow, on the other hand, began to increase only when 3 micrograms/kg per min was given, and no further changes occurred with the highest dose. Intra-arterial blood pressure fell only when the highest dose was given. Renin secretion tended to increase, but changes were not statistically significant. It is concluded that systemic suppression of converting enzyme is needed for renal vasodilatation to occur. However, the renal vascular response comes well before blood pressure falls.", 
    "158": "We investigated in the isolated rabbit aorta the ability of the endothelium to attenuate the vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin (ANG) I and II. After preincubation with enalaprilat, which inhibited the conversion of ANG I to ANG II by 80%, the contractile response to ANG I (10(-8) to 10(-6) mol/l) was significantly greater in aortae which were endothelium-denuded compared with endothelium-intact segments. There was no such difference for ANG II (10(-10) to 3 x 10(-8) mol/l). We conclude that an endothelium-mediated dilatation is part of the net vasomotor action of ANG I.", 
    "159": "During converting enzyme inhibition, a striking difference is found between plasma immunoreactive angiotensin (ANG) II and ANG-(1-8)octapeptide as specifically measured after high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The relative contributions to this difference of cross-reacting ANG I and shorter ANG peptides other than (1-8)octapeptide are not known. Eight normal volunteers were given a daily single oral dose of enalapril (20 mg) for 4 days. Plasma levels of ANG-(1-8)octapeptide, (2-8)heptapeptide, (3-8)hexapeptide and (4-8)pentapeptide as well as blood concentrations of ANG I and plasma angiotensin converting enzyme activity were measured before and 4 h post drug on the first and the last day of treatment. Plasma peptides were extracted with bonded-phase silica and separated by isocratic reversed-phase HPLC before radio-immunoassay. Significant cross-reactivity of an antiserum permitted the individual measurement of different ANG peptides and metabolites in plasma. During converting enzyme inhibition, the plasma levels of ANG metabolites tended to decrease, but they remained measurable. Thus, depending on the specificity of the antiserum used, conventional measurement of immunoreactive ANG II underestimates to various degrees the inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme.", 
    "160": "Forty-four essential hypertensive patients were studied during placebo and after 2 months of the following treatments: hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg once daily (group 1); captopril 50 mg twice daily (group 2); hydrochlorothiazide + captopril (group 3). Blood pressure, serum sodium and potassium (Nae, Ke) and intralymphocytic sodium and potassium (Nai, Ki) were measured before and after treatment. During placebo, diastolic blood pressure was directly related to Nai (r = -0.84) and inversely related to Ki (r = -0.81). The correlation was even greater when the Ki:Ke ratio was considered instead of Ki alone (r = -0.91). Hydrochlorothiazide reduced Nai, Ke and Ki. Captopril induced a decrease in Nai, an increase in Ki and no change in Nae or Ke. The association of the two drugs caused a reduction in Nae and Nai and an increase in Ki. All three treatments caused an increase in Ki:Ke ratio which was proportional to the decrease in the blood pressure. While the antihypertensive effect of hydrochlorothiazide seems to be more related to Nai:Nae reduction, the effect of captopril seems to be more related to the increase in Ki:Ke ratio. The results of our study suggest that hyperpolarization of arterial smooth muscle cells, induced by a Ki:Ke ratio increase, along with a reduction in Nai:Nae, might play a role in the antihypertensive effect of captopril and hydrochlorothiazide.", 
    "161": "The cerebrovascular effect of converting enzyme inhibition was investigated in normal volunteers, in hypertensive patients and in patients with severe chronic heart failure. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured by single photon emission tomography of the uptake and wash-out of inhaled xenon-133. In some of the patients, CBF was also monitored by repeated determinations of the cerebral arterio-venous oxygen difference. In the normal volunteers and the hypertensive patients captopril (50 mg) caused a downward shift of the lower limit of CBF autoregulation of 10-15 mmHg. In some of the patients with chronic heart failure, captopril (6.25 mg) induced a marked decrease of the arterial blood pressure. Regional and average CBF, however, remained constant. These findings indicate that captopril treatment may protect the brain against ischaemia during sudden decreases of the blood pressure by a shift of the lower limit of CBF autoregulation.", 
    "162": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potentiating effect of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 12.5 or 25 mg once daily when added in a placebo-controlled double-blind randomized study of patients with essential hypertension, whose diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was not adequately controlled (DBP > 90 mmHg) following 6 weeks of single-blind treatment with the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril, 20 mg once daily. Forty-eight patients started the first period with enalapril after 4 weeks on placebo. In 13 patients DBP fell to < or = 90 mmHg after enalapril for 6 weeks. In this group supine mean arterial pressure (MAP) was reduced by 13% (P < 0.01). In the patients whose DBP was > 90 mmHg after 6 weeks on enalapril (n = 32) the average supine MAP fell by 9% (P < 0.001). After 3 weeks there was no further drop in blood pressure (BP). Addition of HCTZ to the 32 patients with DBP > 90 mmHg caused a significant further drop in supine BP by 13/7 mmHg with 12.5 mg and by 15/7 mmHg with 25 mg. Seven patients discontinued the study, none due to side effects on enalapril alone. Well-being, assessed with a special questionnaire, was significantly better with enalapril as monotherapy compared with previous treatment, but not different from well-being during the placebo periods. It is concluded that 20 mg enalapril once daily lowered BP effectively and was well tolerated. The maximum BP lowering effect was seen within 3 weeks. Addition of HCTZ caused a significant, and clinically relevant, further drop in BP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "163": "A parenteral preparation of captopril has been used to produce a smooth reduction of blood pressure in patients presenting with accelerated phase hypertension. In five out of six patients studied, an intravenous infusion of captopril at dose rates ranging from 250-2000 micrograms/h lowered blood pressure from 199 +/- 13/115 +/- 5 to 143 +/- 14/86 +/- 5 mmHg over several hours without adverse effects. Partial inhibition of the angiotensin converting enzyme was demonstrated by a rise in plasma renin activity (PRA) and a fall (although not to normal) in elevated levels of angiotensin II and aldosterone. The plasma level of free captopril at the point of blood pressure control was 15 +/- 4 ng/ml and its short effective half-life was demonstrated by a rise in blood pressure within 15 minutes of stopping the infusion. These data demonstrate that very small amounts of captopril can produce a dose-dependent inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme without abrupt changes in blood pressure.", 
    "164": "This pilot study was undertaken to examine the safety and efficacy of enalapril in the treatment of hypertension associated with impaired renal function. Forty-one patients with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < or = 50 ml/min received enalapril for up 12 weeks. Blood pressure, renal function, biochemistry and haematology were monitored weekly for 4 weeks and then monthly. Blood pressure was effectively reduced within 4 weeks; this reduction was maintained for at least 12 weeks. Renal function remained stable and there was no significant sustained alteration in any biochemical or haematological parameter. Requirement for additional antihypertensive drugs was reduced during enalapril therapy. These data suggest that enalapril may have a useful role in the management of hypertension associated with renal impairment.", 
    "165": "The hypothesis that vasopressin participates in cardiovascular adaptation to sodium depletion was examined in male Sprague-Dawley rats studied after 6 days (n = 28) or 4 weeks (n = 28) of low sodium diet. Blood pressure was similar on the two diets but heart rate, water intake and urine volume were all significantly greater at 4 weeks. Animals were randomly assigned to four acute treatment groups: controls, vasopressin pressor antagonist, d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)AVP (AVPA, 10 micrograms/kg); angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, enalaprilic acid (150 micrograms/kg); combined ACE inhibitor and AVPA. Cardiac output and blood flow distribution were measured using labelled microspheres. Blood pressure, cardiac output and blood flow distribution were unchanged after AVPA alone. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition and ACE inhibitor plus AVPA produced similar falls in mean blood pressure at 6 days (-12 +/- 1, -14 +/- 3 mmHg) and 4 weeks (-11 +/- 2, -16 +/- 2 mmHg) due to parallel falls in peripheral resistance. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition was associated with selective increases in renal and mesenteric blood flow. Renal blood flow increased further after combined blockade at 6 days (ACE inhibitor 9.68 +/- 0.71; ACE inhibitor plus AVPA 11.92 +/- 0.73 ml/min per g, P < 0.05) but not at 4 weeks (ACE inhibitor 11.15 +/- 0.23; ACE inhibitor plus AVPA 10.76 +/- 0.78 ml/min per g). Vasopressin appears to contribute to early but not late cardiovascular adaptation to sodium depletion. A specific effect on the renal vascular bed is only revealed after removal of the dominant effect of angiotensin II (ANG II).", 
    "166": "Cardiac performance, as judged by preload, afterload, and myocardial contractility, was evaluated by non-invasive M-mode echocardiography before and after acute oral administration of calcium entry blockers (nitrendipine and verapamil), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (captopril and lisinopril), and a dopamine receptor agonist (fenoldopam) in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. Left ventricular end diastolic volume was taken as an index of preload, end systolic stress as an index of afterload, and the ratio of systolic pressure to end systolic volume (SBP:ESV), ejection fraction (EF), and mean velocity of circumferential fibre shortening (Vcf) as indices of contractility. Reductions of afterload and mean arterial pressure were achieved with all antihypertensive agents involved (mean percentage change +/- s.e.m.: 15 +/- 2% and 10 +/- 1%, respectively, P < 0.05) but the afterload reduction with lisinopril was greatest (21 +/- 9%; P < 0.01). The dopamine receptor agonist fenoldopam decreased by preload 24% (P < 0.05) and increased all of the three parameters of myocardial contractility (SBP:SV 66%; EF 17%, Vcf 19%; P < 0.01). In contrast, no effect on these parameters was observed with either calcium entry blocker or either ACE inhibitor.", 
    "167": "Renal vein renin measurements were compared in 64 hypertensive patients with arteriographically documented stenoses or complete occlusion of one or both renal arteries. The characteristic pattern of curable renovascular hypertension, i.e. increased increment of renin from the ischaemic kidney with contralateral suppression of renin secretion, was seen not only in patients with unilateral stenoses, but also in most patients with bilateral stenoses. Contralateral suppression was less marked in azotemic patients. The highest increments of renal vein renin were seen when the renal artery was completely occluded. The patterns were similar following acute or chronic administration of captopril, suggesting that angiotensin II is not responsible. Increased sodium delivery to the macula densa is postulated as a possible cause of contralateral suppression.", 
    "168": "A total of 179 patients were selected for a diagnostic work-up of renovascular hypertension from a consecutive series of hypertensive patients referred to a single outpatient clinic between January 1978 and January 1985. Selection criteria were: (1) diagnostic blood pressure > 120 mmHg in patients of 40 years or younger, irrespective of whether they were on treatment or not, and/or (2) diastolic blood pressure > 100 mmHg despite combination therapy with at least three drugs. All patients underwent renal angiography. The diagnostic value of the responses of blood pressure and plasma renin 1 h after 50 mg captopril was assessed while the patients were untreated for at least 2 weeks. The captopril test had a predictive value of 0.92 using a concentration of enzymatically active renin in plasma > 200 microU/ml as criterion for a positive test. The predictive value of a negative test was 0.81. Predictive values were not improved by combining blood pressure response with renin level after captopril. The prevalence of renal artery stenosis was 50% (unilateral stenosis 34%). In a hypertension clinic where patients with severe or therapy-resistant hypertension and a high prevalence of renal artery stenosis are seen, the captopril test proves to be useful for selecting cases for renal angiography.", 
    "169": "Several lines of evidence indicate that angiotensin II (ANG II) may potentiate the vascular response to sympathetic stimulation. However, there are no clear signs that this action of ANG II is physiologically relevant in man. To investigate this problem, we used the lower body negative pressure technique (LBNP, -15 mmHg) to deactivate cardiopulmonary receptors and reflexly stimulate the sympathetic nervous system. The haemodynamic (changes in blood pressure, heart rate, central venous pressure, forearm blood flow) and humoral effects [changes in plasma noradrenaline (PNA) and plasma renin activity (PRA)] of this manoeuvre were examined before and after blockade of angiotensin formation achieved by the administration of the converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril. Studies were performed in patients with essential hypertension in control conditions and after acute and chronic captopril treatment. We found that the reduction in forearm blood flow induced by LBNP was significantly diminished after acute and chronic captopril in spite of the fact that the fall in central venous pressure and the increases in PNA were similar to those observed in control conditions. In contrast, the response of renin to LBNP was enhanced, at least after acute captopril administration. These findings suggest that efficiency of the reflexes originating from the cardiopulmonary receptors is impaired after captopril. Angiotensin II contributes to the vasoconstrictive ability of the sympathetic nervous system, either through a direct vascular action or by enhancing the vascular responsiveness to noradrenaline stimulation. However, this sympathetic facilitatory action of ANG II does not appear to be extended on the adrenergic mechanisms which regulate renin release.", 
    "170": "The acute cardiovascular effects of S 9490-3, a new angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, were studied by means of a computerized analysis of the intra-aortic blood pressure (BP), recorded continuously for 48 h in conscious, unrestrained, adult spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The first 24-h recording period was used as a control. On the second day, the rats received a single intravenous (i.v.) injection of S 9490-3 (0.2 mg/kg) at 11 a.m. followed by another 2 mg/kg i.v. injection at 3 p.m. Cardiovascular activity was studied up to 8 a.m. the next day. No significant cardiovascular effects appeared after the 0.2 mg/kg dose, whereas the 2 mg/kg dose induced a rapid fall in systolic and diastolic BP, which remained significant for about 11 h. This BP decrease was not associated with any elevation in heart rate, but with a short lasting increase in dP/dt max. These results are in good agreement with those already obtained with S 9490-3 in various experimental conditions. They suggest that long-term recordings of intra-arterial BP in freely moving rats is of value in the study of drugs which act on the cardiovascular system.", 
    "171": "The acute effects of nifedipine (20 mg sublingually) and of captopril (12.5 mg orally) on blood pressure and on platelet intracellular free calcium were investigated in 11 and 12 patients, respectively, with essential hypertension. Platelet calcium was measured by the Quin 2 method. Application of both drugs resulted in a significant fall in blood pressure within 60 min. Platelet calcium, however, was lowered by nifedipine only. There was no correlation between blood pressure reduction and changes in platelet calcium. Platelet intracellular free calcium concentration was 99 +/- 3 nmol in 30 normotensive subjects and 109 +/- 5 nmol (+/- s.e.m.) in 26 patients with essential hypertension (P < 0.05). There was a wide overlap between the values of normotensives and hypertensives. Thus there is no positive evidence of an increased platelet intracellular free calcium concentration in a large proportion of patients with essential hypertension.", 
    "172": "The relationship was studied between brain catecholamine systems, open-field behaviour and the development of hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Both the rise in blood pressure and the increased open-field rearing activity of SHR were inhibited by central dopamine depletion. Antihypertensive treatment with hydralazine or captopril did not change behaviour, however. It is suggested that central dopamine systems may form a link between changes in behaviour of SHR and the development of hypertension in this strain. The changes in behaviour may underlie rather than be the result of the hypertension.", 
    "173": "The present study was done to investigate the role of endogenous prostaglandins and kinins in the mechanism of captopril-induced hypotensive effect and stimulating effect of plasma renin activity (PRA) in pentobarbital-anesthetized rats. An intravenous injection of 1 mg/kg captopril significantly decreased mean blood pressure (MBP) and raised PRA. In indomethacin (5 mg/kg, i.v.)-, or aprotinin (50,000 kallikrein inhibitory units/kg and subsequent 100 k.i.u./kg X min, i.v.)-pretreated rats, MBP reduction and elevation of PRA induced by captopril were similar to those in the non-pretreated animals throughout the experimental periods. These results suggest that prostaglandins and/or the kallikrein-kinin system do not substantially participate in the captopril-induced hypotension and renin release under the present experimental conditions.", 
    "174": "A dose-response relationship for substance P and contraction of the lung parenchyma strip of the guinea-pig could only be obtained in the presence of a mixture of bacitracin, 1,4 dithio-L-threitol and ethylenediamine tetracetic acid, all at 100 microM, or in the presence of captopril, 1.8 mM. Substance P (50 nM) caused no contraction by itself but produced a shift to the left of the dose-response curve for histamine with a mean dose-ratio of 1.4 +/- 0.2 (S.E. of mean). The peptides physalaemin, eledoisin and kassinin were all approximately equipotent with substance P on the lung strip, in the presence of peptides inhibitors. [D-Pro4, D-Trp7,9,10]-SP4-11, produced dose-related inhibition of the contraction induced by substance P. Substance P activity in guinea-pig lung declined exponentially with a half-time of 2.3 min: bacitracin, dithiothreitol and EDTA (all 100 microM) increased this to 7.2 min and captopril (1.8 mM) to 5.1 min.", 
    "175": "The presence of adenosine receptors coupled to adenylate cyclase in rat heart sarcolemma is demonstrated in these studies. Heart sarcolemma was isolated by the hypotonic shock-Lithium bromide treatment method. This preparation contained negligible amounts (2-4%) of contamination by other subcellular organelles such as mitochondria, sarcoplasmic reticulum, and myofibrils as verified by electron microscopic examination. In addition this preparation was also devoid of endothelial cells, since angiotensin-converting enzyme activity was not detected in this preparation. N-Ethylcarboxamide adenosine (NECA), L-N6-phenylisopropyladenosine (PIA), and adenosine N'-oxide (Ado N'-oxide) were all able to stimulate adenylate cyclase in heart sarcolemma, but not in crude homogenate, with an apparent Ka of 3-7 microM. The activation of adenylate cyclase by NECA was dependent on the concentrations of metal ions such as Mg2+ or Mn2+. The maximal stimulation was observed at lower concentrations of the metal ions (0.2-0.5 mM). At 5 mM Mg2+ or Mn2+, the stimulation by NECA was completely abolished. The stimulatory effect of NECA on adenylate cyclase was also dependent on guanine nucleotides and was blocked by 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. In addition, 2'-deoxyadenosine showed an inhibitory effect on adenylate cyclase. The myocardial adenylate cyclase was also stimulated by beta-adrenergic agonists, dopamine and glucagon, and inhibited by cholinergic agonists such as carbachol and oxotremorine. The stimulation of adenylate cyclase by NECA was found to be additive with maximal stimulation obtained by epinephrine. These data suggest that rat heart sarcolemma contains adenosine (Ra), beta-adrenergic, dopaminergic, glucagon, and cholinergic receptors, and the stimulation of adenylate cyclase by epinephrine and adenosine occurs by distinctly different mechanism or adenosine and epinephrine stimulate different cyclase populations.", 
    "176": "We describe a quantitative autoradiographic technique which allows measurement of angiotensin-I-converting enzyme [ACE] (kininase II, peptidyldipeptide hydrolase, EC 3.4.15.1) levels in discrete areas of pituitary and adrenal glands in individual animals. Tissue sections were incubated with 125I-351A, a specific ACE inhibitor, and results were obtained with computerized densitometry and comparison to 125I standards. There were high levels of ACE in both the anterior and posterior lobes of the pituitary, with no detectable binding in the intermediate lobe. The maximum binding capacity (Bmax) was 920 +/- 62 fmol/mg protein for the anterior pituitary and 1162 +/- 67 fmol/mg protein for posterior pituitary. The binding affinity constant (Ka) was 0.95 +/- 0.11 X 10(9) M-1 and 1.20 +/- 0.19 X 10(9) M-1 for the anterior and posterior lobes, respectively. In the adrenal gland, there were two distinct areas of specific binding, the adrenal medulla and the adrenal capsule-zona glomerulosa area. The Bmax for the adrenal medulla was 652 +/- 80 fmol/mg protein and 294 +/- 53 fmol/mg protein for the adrenal capsule-zona glomerulosa. The Ka for 351A was 1.04 +/- 0.19 X 10(9) M-1 and 1.74 +/- 0.40 X 10(9) M-1 for medulla and adrenal capsule-zona glomerulosa respectively. The results support the existence of local ANG systems active in both the pituitary and adrenal glands.", 
    "177": "The immunogenicity of captopril (CP), conjugated to heterologous proteins, was investigated in male New Zealand White rabbits by monthly injections of CP-protein conjugates in Freund's Complete Adjuvant. Anti-CP antibody activity was readily detected by immunodiffusion in sera of rabbits immunized with the amide-linked CP-HSA (23:1) conjugate. Hapten inhibition studies revealed that the antigenic determinant contained CP and a lysine residue from the protein carrier. When rabbits were immunized with disulphide-linked CP-S-S-HSA (9:1) and CP-S-S-KLH (160:1) conjugates, anti-CP antibody activity was detected by a sensitive ELISA method, but not by immunodiffusion and radioligand binding assays. The specificity of the serum IgG anti-CP activity after immunization with disulphide-linked CP-S-S-protein conjugates was confirmed since anti-CP activity was inhibited by preincubation of the antisera with CP conjugated to an unrelated protein carrier (CP-S-S-OVA), but not by the corresponding unconjugated protein, nor by penicillamine-S-S-protein conjugates. These results show that disulphide-linked CP-protein conjugates are sufficiently stable to induce humoral (B lymphocyte) anti-hapten responses under the experimental conditions employed. In a separate study, delayed-type skin hypersensitivity reactions to topically applied CP were demonstrated in the guinea pig. The specific and sensitive immunochemical technique (ELISA) described here could be useful in future studies for determining whether or not patients taking CP produce antibodies to the drug.", 
    "178": "Metabolites of substance P, produced by incubation with isolated epithelial cells and with purified brush border and basolateral membrane from pig small intestine, were isolated by high performance liquid chromatography and identified by amino acid analysis. Rapid cleavages between Gln6-Phe7, Phe7-Phe8 and Gly9-Leu10 and oxidation of the methionine residue at position 11 were observed with cells and with both membrane fractions. Formation of substance P3-11' indicative of the action of dipeptidylaminopeptidase IV (EC 3.4.14.5), was observed only at high substrate concentration. Proteolytic degradation was inhibited by phosphoramidon and by EDTA but was insensitive to chloride ion concentration and to captopril. These observations suggest that inactivation of substance P in the epithelial layer of the gut is mediated through endopeptidase-24.11 (EC 3.4.24.11) in the cell-surface membrane and that degradation by angiotensin-converting enzyme (EC 3.4.15.1), although present in high concentration in the mucosa, is unimportant.", 
    "179": "This open randomised parallel trial compared the antihypertensive efficacy of enalapril and atenolol given alone once a day or with hydrochlorothiazide in 20 patients with moderate to severe hypertension. Active treatment was over a 26 week period, consisting of an initial titration phase followed by a fixed dose phase. Both treatment regimes effectively lowered systolic and diastolic blood pressures. All patients on enalapril reached normotension (supine diastolic blood pressure less than or equal to 90 mmHg) compared with 78% on atenolol. Pulse rate was not appreciably changed by enalapril, but was significantly reduced by atenolol. No serious adverse reactions or significant changes in laboratory values were noted in either group. The commonest adverse reaction with enalapril was dizziness which occurred in two cases and resolved on dosage reduction. Enalapril with hydrochlorothiazide given once daily may provide a useful combination in the treatment of moderate to severe hypertension.", 
    "180": "We report the localization and characterization of angiotensin-converting enzyme (kininase II) in discrete nuclei from individual rat brains by a quantitative autoradiographic technique coupled to computerized microdensitometry. The enzyme was quantitated by incubation of 16-micron-thick brain sections with 0.07-2 nM of the converting enzyme inhibitor 125I-351A and comparison to 125I-standards. This technique can be applied to the study of other enzymes in single rat brain nuclei.", 
    "181": "Afterload reduction is an accepted therapeutic principle in the management of acute aortic (Ai) and mitral insufficiency (Mi). The question whether acute and chronic converting-enzyme inhibition by captopril has a beneficial hemodynamic effect in chronic Ai and Mi has been investigated in 17 patients with Ai and 10 with Mi. Ejection and regurgitation fraction (RF) were measured by radionuclide ventriculography (RNV) before, after 25 mg captopril and after 3-5 months of long-term treatment. The humoral response of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) was quantified by analysis of angiotensin I and II. Captopril lowered under acute and chronic treatment RF in Ai and Mi by 32%. Angiotensin II levels decreased by the same order of magnitude. Acute and chronic vasodilation was followed by a distinct but well tolerated fall in blood pressure, especially in patients with Mi. These favourable hemodynamic effects of captopril make this therapy an adjunct but not an alternative to valve replacement.", 
    "182": "In the present study 13 patients with severe chronic heart failure were investigated by right heart catheterization at rest and during handgrip before and 6 months after treatment with captopril (mean dose 2 X 37.5 mg per day). Before initiating captopril therapy all patients were clinically stable on digitalis and diuretics. During the observation period 3 patients died suddenly. Of the remaining cases, 5 had dilated cardiomyopathy and 5 ischemic heart disease. After 6 months, resting hemodynamic measurements changed as follows: systemic vascular resistance decreased from 1594 to 1284 dyn X sec X cm-5 (p less than 0.005), left ventricular end-diastolic pressure decreased from 17 to 10 mm Hg (p less than 0.01) and stroke volume index increased from 32 to 40 ml/m2 (p less than 0.05). Before captopril, 9 patients showed no increase or even a decrease of stroke work index during isometric exercise, whereas after captopril 5 out of the 10 patients showed an increase in stroke work index. The results demonstrate that, in patients with severe chronic heart failure, long-term afterload reduction with captopril is accompanied by a significant improvement in left ventricular performance at rest. Furthermore, during isometric exercise after captopril an improvement in left ventricular function was found in 5 out of 10 patients.", 
    "183": "The new, long acting converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril was given to 26 patients with moderate to severe heart failure. In 23 cases the mean systolic blood pressure fell from 120 (SD 22) to 108 (25) mm Hg without adverse effects. Profound hypotension with severe bradycardia and sweating, however, occurred in three patients, most pronounced two to four hours after the first dose. The haemodynamic and biochemical changes in these patients were similar to those seen in patients with severe symptomatic hypotension after the first dose of the converting enzyme inhibitor captopril, except that with enalapril the changes occurred later and were longer lasting. Evidence of myocardial damage and reversible renal failure was seen in one patient, and acute reversible deterioration in renal function occurred in one other. In patients with heart failure converting enzyme inhibitors should be administered initially under strict medical supervision with appropriate facilities available for dealing with occasional profound hypotension.", 
    "184": "In order to evaluate the participation of prostaglandins and bradykinin in autoregulation of renal blood flow, the pressure-flow relationships were examined before and during the infusion of prostaglandin E2, sodium arachidonate or bradykinin in the pump-perfused kidney of anesthetized dogs. Renal arterial pressure was changed in a step-wise fashion between 60 and 200 mmHg by means of a pneumatic resistance. Renal blood flow revealed an effective autoregulation against the pressure changes between 100 and 200 mmHg. Infusion of prostaglandin E2 (30 and 100 ng/min), sodium arachidonate (200 and 500 micrograms/min) or bradykinin (100 and 300 ng/min) into the renal artery increased renal blood flow dose-dependently, but had no influence on the autoregulation of renal blood flow. We also examined the effect of endogenous bradykinin and prostaglandins by the intravenous administration of captopril (1 mg/kg), a kininase II inhibitor, and indomethacin (2.5 mg/kg), a cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, respectively. Captopril increased renal blood flow, but did not impair the autoregulation. Indomethacin decreased renal blood flow and had no effect on the renal autoregulation. It is considered that prostaglandins and bradykinin which induced renal vasodilation have no role in the autoregulation of renal blood flow in the dog kidney.", 
    "185": "To estimate the renal ischemia-protective effect of saralasin, model studies were performed on rats and dogs. Acute ischemic renal failure was induced in rats by clamping off the vascular pedicle for 90 minutes. When the drug was prophylactically administered before the ischemia episode, a premature increase in post-ischemic plasma urea level and a shortening of survival time of the animals were observed compared with the untreated control. Following auto-transplantation of 24-hour cold-stored dog kidneys, the infusion of saralasin failed to improve renal blood flow (MRBF), glomerular filtration rate (KrCl) and fractional sodium excretion (FENa). On the other hand, the angiotensin blockade with captopril led to an increase in MRBF which was associated, however, with significant decreases in KrCl and FENa. This discrepancy was suggested to be due to a predominant postglomerular vasodilation. The results show that the application of saralasin before renal ischemia may aggravate the loss of renal function whilst the post-ischemic administration of the drug has no substantial effect on the acute failure of transplanted kidneys.", 
    "186": "The effect of acute and chronic administration of cyclosporine on systemic and renal hemodynamics was studied in conscious rats. Infusion of cyclosporine in a dose of 20 mg/kg (Cy 20) resulted in a significant fall in renal blood flow (RBF) (3.4 vs. 6.5 ml/min/g, P less than 0.05) and a rise in renal vascular resistance (RVR) (36.9 vs. 20.6 mm Hg/ml/min/g, P less than 0.05). Infusion of cyclosporine at a dose of 10 mg/kg (Cy 10) did not result in a significant change in RBF or RVR. Both doses of cyclosporine resulted in stimulation of plasma renin activity (PRA) from control values of 5.6 +/- 0.8 ng/ml/hr to 11.6 +/- 2.0 with 10 mg/kg and 26.7 +/- 5.6 with 20 mg/kg. Urinary 6-keto-PGF1 alpha excretion increased from control values of 14.0 +/- 2.0 ng/6 hr to 22.7 +/- 2.2 with 10 mg/kg and 25.0 +/- 2.0 with 20 mg/kg. Similar effects on RBF, RVR, PRA, and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha excretion were seen after chronic administration of cyclosporine (20 mg/kg i.p. for 7 days). Pretreatment of animals with captopril did not prevent the fall in RBF after cyclosporine, suggesting that the vasoconstriction was not mediated by angiotensin II. Animals treated with meclofenamate demonstrated reduction in RBF with 10 mg/kg cyclosporine (4.3 vs. 7.0 ml/min/g, P less than 0.05), suggesting that prostaglandins protect against the vasoconstrictor effect of cyclosporine. Administration of phenoxybenzamine after cyclosporine improved RBF (5.0 vs. 3.4 ml/min/g) and restored RVR to normal. Similarly, renal denervation dramatically reduced the fall in RBF after cyclosporine (innervated right kidney 3.6 vs. denervated left kidney 6.0 ml/min/g, P less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "187": "A controlled study was conducted in hypertensive patients to investigate whether captopril can be substituted for the various other antihypertensive drugs (not including diuretics) to reduce side effects and improve the quality of life. Captopril in a twice daily dose of 25-50 mg, was substituted and titrated in 54 patients. Fifty-two patients, matched by age and sex, comprised the control group, and were treated with a variety of agents. During a follow-up of 9 months, 44 of the patients receiving captopril (81%) achieved the goal of supine blood pressure less than 90 mmHg. Captopril was discontinued in two patients due to side effects. Mild proteinuria was observed in two patients. A significant reduction in scores or rates of side effects (numbness, blurred vision, insomnia, vivid dreams, cold extremities, sleepiness, sexual dysfunction and fatigue) and improvement in quality of life (general feeling, mood and concentration) was observed in the study group compared with the control group. Captopril alone in a twice daily dose of 25-50 mg, or in co-treatment with thiazide, provided sustained blood pressure control with minimal side effects and improvement in quality of life compared with the treatment of hypertension with beta-blockers, vasodilators or methyldopa.", 
    "188": "The effects of captopril have been studied in 10 patients suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with moderate essential hypertension. Captopril was given as monotherapy (75-100 mg/day) over a period of 60 days. The following effects of captopril were seen in these patients: a significant reduction of systolic blood pressure (P less than 0.01) and of diastolic blood pressure (P less than 0.001), both in the supine and in the standing position; a significant increase of the vital capacity (P less than 0.05); no significant change in other various respiratory function tests or of heart rate, and no side effects, including bronchospasm in the patients sensitive to bronchodilator drugs. The present data suggest that in COPD patients with essential hypertension, captopril is an effective hypotensive agent and has no adverse effects in pulmonary function.", 
    "189": "Ten type I and 10 type II hypertensive diabetic patients were treated for 12 weeks with captopril (50 mg twice daily). Good control of blood pressure was achieved without any significant adverse effect on carbohydrate metabolism or renal haemodynamics and without evidence of glomerular or tubular damage.", 
    "190": "The antihypertensive and anti-ischaemic effects of methyldopa and captopril were compared in 12 hypertensive patients with coronary artery disease. The antihypertensive effect of alpha-methyldopa (A) and captopril (C) were significant and similar. On the other hand, while methyldopa did not increase the product of systolic pressure and heart rate and did decrease the effort-induced S-T segment depression, C increased the double product (DP) and decreased the ischaemic S-T changes. Captopril might be useful in the treatment of hypertensive patients with coronary artery disease.", 
    "191": "The aim of the present study was to evaluate changes in urinary micro-albumin and in serum and urinary beta 2-microglobulin during treatment with captopril at low doses in a group of hypertensive outpatients without any sign of renal impairment. Thirty-four patients with essential hypertension entered the study, all having been treated for at least one year with beta-blockers and diuretics. None had proteinuria (by Albustix) and creatinine clearance was normal. The patients were randomly allocated to two groups: the first group was maintained on the previous regimen (group BD) and the second received captopril 50 mg twice daily instead of the beta-blocker (group CD). During the year of observation blood pressure values and serum and urinary beta 2-microglobulin were not significantly different between the two groups. There was, however, a significant reduction in albumin excretion rate (AER) in the CD group at both 3 and 6 months. Since arterial measures did not differ between the two groups, it is proposed that the reduction of AER was due to a diminution of the transcapillary hydraulic pressure due to the inhibition of the intrarenal angiotensin II induced by captopril.", 
    "192": "In hypertensive patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis (RAS) or RAS of a solitary kidney, reversible decrease of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) or acute renal failure has been observed following captopril administration. Decrease of GFR has been ascribed to preferential efferent vasodilatation. To test this hypothesis, acute changes of mean arterial pressure (MAP), renal plasma flow (RPF), GFR, plasma renin activity (PRA) and PGE2-excretion after 50 mg captopril orally were measured in post-transplant hypertensives with and without transplant renal artery stenosis (TRAS) during treatment with diuretics. The fall in MAP was similar in both groups; RPF did not change significantly; GFR decreased from 58 +/- 14 (s.d.) to 49 +/- 14 ml/min (TRAS, n = 8) and from 60 +/- 15 to 50 +/- 16 ml/min (without TRAS, n = 8). There was no evidence of postglomerular dilatation in patients with TRAS, and filtration fraction decreased only in patients without TRAS. Increase of PRA after captopril was not significantly different between the two groups. PGE2-excretion did not change significantly. In one patient with severe TRAS, long term angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and acute normalization of MAP with sodium nitroprusside both induced a comparable decrease of GFR. The results demonstrate that acute postglomerular vasodilatation does not necessarily occur after ACE inhibition in patients with TRAS and a high-renin state.", 
    "193": "Recent studies have reported that captopril can acutely induce a marked decrease of glomerular filtration rate in kidneys affected by renal artery stenosis, an effect detectable by scintigraphic techniques. Experience which confirms and extends this observation, obtained in five patients with renovascular hypertension, is reported here. For comparison, eight essential hypertensives and six patients with non-vascular unilateral renal diseases were studied. In each patient the ratio of glomerular filtration rate between the two kidneys was estimated during two consecutive scintigraphic studies with the glomerular tracer 99mTc-DTPA: in all renovascular patients captopril induced a marked decrease of glomerular filtration rate on the affected side, whereas negligible changes were observed in all other subjects. These results confirm that captopril may almost completely suppress glomerular filtration in kidneys affected by unilateral renal artery stenosis, an effect which may not be apparent clinically because of compensation by the other kidney, but which is scintigraphically detectable. Renal scintigraphy after captopril is easy to perform and non-invasive. It therefore seems to be a promising tool for the screening of renovascular hypertension.", 
    "194": "The influence of food intake on the acute haemodynamic and humoral effects of captopril has been investigated. Eighteen patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension (diastolic blood pressure 95-115 mmHg) were treated in a randomized crossover study with a single oral dose of 25 mg captopril after 2 weeks of placebo. They were randomized to receive captopril either 1 h before or together with a standardized breakfast. Blood pressure, heart rate and plasma concentrations of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), angiotensin II (ANG II) and captopril were measured before and every 30 min up to 4 h after drug administration. Angiotensin converting enzyme was significantly more suppressed and plasma concentrations of captopril were significantly higher when the drug was given in the fasting patients. However, there was no significant difference in blood pressure reduction whether captopril was administered in the fasting patients or together with food. The results indicate that the antihypertensive efficacy of captopril is not markedly affected when the drug is administered with food.", 
    "195": "The effects of acute administration of captopril on heart rate, blood pressure and physiological responses to head-up tilt, hand-grip, exercise and Valsalva manoeuvre were studied in 25 hypertensive subjects (10 untreated, 15 previously treated). After chronic administration for 8-12 weeks the effect on heart rate, blood pressure and the response to head-up tilt were studied again in 15 of these subjects. After the first dose of captopril (0.5 mg/kg), both systolic and diastolic blood pressures fell significantly, with no change in heart rate. Head-up tilting produced a significant increase in heart rate without any alteration in the blood pressure; hand-grip produced a significant increase in heart rate and blood pressure. These responses and exercise-induced tachycardia were unaltered by captopril. There was a significant reduction in the Valsalva ratio. After chronic administration the hypotensive efficacy was maintained for 10-12 h after the last dose, suggesting that twice daily dosage may be sufficient. There was a significant reduction in the basal supine heart rate by captopril. Head-up tilt produced the same physiological changes as in the acute study. These findings suggest that captopril has a vagotonic effect, possibly associated with resetting of baroceptor mechanisms. This could be one explanation for the hypotensive effect of captopril even in low-renin states.", 
    "196": "Acute reversible renal failure has been reported in patients receiving captopril, especially those with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis. Two patients with advanced renal disease presented with an acute deterioration in renal function after the introduction of captopril treatment. In both instances this deterioration was irreversible. Captopril should be used with caution in patients with advanced renal disease.", 
    "197": "The expression of the renin gene in rat kidneys was studied using mouse submaxillary gland renin complementary DNA. The length of rat renin messenger RNA (mRNA) was approximately 1600 nucleotides, similar to that of mouse submaxillary gland and kidney renin mRNA. Rat renin mRNA was quantified by a radiodensitometric complementary DNA hybridization assay. The effects of intense long-term stimulation and short-term inhibition of renin secretion on plasma renin concentration, renal renin concentration, and renin mRNA content were compared with those of controls. After 15 days of sodium depletion and captopril treatment, plasma renin concentration increased 46-fold, renal renin concentration only 1.5-fold, and renin mRNA content increased about threefold. Following a 1-hour infusion of angiotensin II in sodium-depleted and captopril-treated rats, plasma renin concentration decreased by 84% whereas no significant changes in either renal renin concentration or renin mRNA content were observed. These results show that sodium depletion and captopril treatment increase the level of renin gene transcription and renin biosynthesis. However, there are nonproportional changes in plasma renin levels, renal renin content, and its mRNA. These results suggest that newly synthesized renin is not stored in the kidney but is rapidly secreted into the blood. Short-term inhibition of plasma renin concentration by angiotensin II is most likely mediated by posttranslational mechanisms.", 
    "198": "Systemic vascular effects of hydralazine, prazosin, captopril, and nifedipine were studied in 115 anesthetized dogs. Blood flow (Q) and right atrial pressure (Pra) were independently controlled by a right heart bypass. Transient changes in central blood volume after an acute reduction in Pra at a constant Q showed that blood was draining from two vascular compartments with different time constants, one fast and the other slow. At three dose levels producing comparable reductions in systemic arterial pressure (30-40% at the highest dose), these drugs had different effects on flow distribution and venous return. Hydralazine and prazosin had parallel and balanced effects on arterial resistance of the two vascular compartments, and flow distribution was unaltered. Captopril preferentially reduced arterial resistance of the compartment with a slow time constant for venous return (-26 +/- 6%, -30 +/- 6%, -50 +/- 5% at 0.02, 0.10, and 0.50 mg X kg-1 X h-1, respectively; means +/- SEM) without altering arterial resistance of the fast time-constant compartment. Blood flow to the slow time-constant compartment was increased 43 +/- 14% at the highest dose, and central blood volume was reduced 108 +/- 15 mL. In contrast, nifedipine had a balanced effect on arterial resistance with the lowest dose (0.025 mg/kg) but caused a preferential reduction in arterial resistance of the fast time-constant compartment at higher doses (-38 +/- 4% and -55 +/- 2% at 0.05 and 0.10 mg/kg, respectively). Blood flow to the slow time-constant compartment was reduced 36 +/- 5% at the highest dose of nifedipine, and central blood volume was increased 66 +/- 12 mL. Total systemic venous compliance was unaltered or slightly reduced by each of the four drugs. These results add further evidence to the hypothesis that peripheral blood flow distribution is a major determinant of venous return to the heart.", 
    "199": "To determine the influence of captopril on prostaglandins, the levels of plasma 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and thromboxane B2, the stable products of prostacyclin and thromboxane A2, respectively, were measured in 9 essential hypertensive subjects by radioimmunoassay before, 1 hour after a single oral 25 mg dose of captopril, and 2 weeks after administration of oral 25 mg captopril twice daily. A significant increase in plasma 6-keto-PGF1 alpha levels occurred after 2 weeks (p less than 0.05), but after 1 hour the increment was not significant. Plasma thromboxane B2 remained unchanged. Mean blood pressure fell significantly (p less than 0.02 after 1 hour, p less than 0.005 after 2 weeks) and plasma renin activity increased significantly after both periods (p less than 0.01 after 1 hour, p less than 0.02 after 2 weeks). There was no significant correlation between changes in blood pressure and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha for either time period. These results suggest that the elevation of plasma 6-keto-PGF1 alpha by captopril therapy was not responsible for reducing blood pressure, while enhanced plasma prostacyclin as a chronic response may contribute to prevention of thrombotic disorders and organ damage.", 
    "200": "We examined the effects of three angiotensin II (AII) analogs, [Sar1,Ala8] AII, [Sar1,Ile8] AII, and [Sar1,Thr8] AII, phenoxybenzamine and captopril on the pressor response to angiotensins I (AI) and II (AII) and norepinephrine (NE) in the bullfrog, Rana catesbeiana. Injection of AI and AII at 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 micrograms/kg, or NE at 3 micrograms/kg elicited dose-dependent rises in blood pressure. [Sar1,Ile8] AII (10 micrograms/kg/min) significantly blocked the pressor effects of all AI and AII doses. [Sar1,Ala8] AII blocked only the highest dose, and [Sar1,Thr8] AII produced no blockade. Captopril (0.1 mg/kg bolus + 0.5 mg/kg/hr) significantly reduced the response to AI, but not AII or NE. Phenoxybenzamine (5-10 mg bolus + 1 mg/kg/hr) blocked NE, and partially inhibited (36-49%) the pressor effects of AI and AII. These results demonstrate that (1) [Sar1,Ile8] AII is a potent angiotensin antagonist in the bullfrog, while [Sar1,Ala8] AII is partially effective and [Sar1,Thr8] AII is largely ineffectual; (2) captopril is an effective converting enzyme inhibitor; and (3) a portion of the angiotensin response can be inhibited by alpha-receptor blockade and is apparently due to catecholamine release.", 
    "201": "As part of a large multicenter surveillance study of captopril, 975 hypertensive patients aged 65 years or older were treated, 418 of whom received the drug for at least 12 months. Blood pressure was lowered from an entry level of 193/105 +/- 30/16 (mean +/- SD) to 159/88 +/- 25/12 mm Hg, and side effects were infrequent. During treatment, renal function was undisturbed in the majority of patients. The frequency of clinically evident hypotensive episodes did not differ from that found in the total study population, suggesting that in this age group, despite the reduction in blood pressure, cerebral perfusion was maintained. This experience suggests that captopril can be used for the treatment of the elderly hypertensive patient.", 
    "202": "We conducted a prospective study of captopril therapy in patients with scleroderma and combined hypertension and renal insufficiency. In all seven patients studied during a 1-year period, control of blood pressure was achieved, and in six of the seven, renal function stabilized or improved. The total daily dosage of captopril ranged from 32 to 100 mg, divided into doses taken every 6 to 8 hours. Although one patient had a suspected captopril-induced rash for a short time, none of the other patients had any adverse side effects. Renal biopsies were performed in six patients; in three of them, specimens were obtained both at the beginning and at the end of the study. The initial biopsy specimens showed changes that were similar to those described in other reports. Findings on repeat biopsies were unchanged except for evidence of chronicity. In the six patients with controlled blood pressure and improved or stabilized renal function, the improvement was maintained for 1 1/2 to nearly 3 years on this drug therapy. Using specific measurements of skin compliance and vascular blood flow in the upper extremities, we could detect no evidence, however, of concomitant improvement in these other features of the disease. Although the blood pressure was controlled with captopril, one patient had progressive skin induration, one had progressive pulmonary insufficiency, and another had progressive renal failure.", 
    "203": "Our study was undertaken to assess whether the effect of intrarenal infusion of adenosine on renal blood flow and renin release in dogs is modified by the degree of stimulation of the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system. This system was modified by sodium deprivation, extracellular volume expansion, beta-adrenergic blockade and stimulation, angiotensin II infusion, and inhibition of converting enzyme by captopril. In addition, the effect of blocking slow calcium channels with verapamil on the vasoconstrictor effect of adenosine was also studied. Results demonstrate that the vasoconstrictor effect of adenosine was not modified by the status of stimulation or inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system or by the status of expansion of the extracellular volume. In all cases adenosine inhibited the renal secretion of renin. Verapamil abolished the vascular actions of adenosine, but it had no effect on the inhibition of renin release. We conclude that plasma renin or angiotensin II levels are not a necessary determinant of the renal vasoconstriction induced by adenosine. This effect seems to be mediated by the entry of calcium into the cell.", 
    "204": "Potassium is a major regulator of aldosterone production. It also increases adrenal renin. The causal relationship between potassium and adrenal renin is not known. To evaluate the role of the intraadrenal renin-angiotensin (ANG) system in potassium-stimulated aldosterone synthesis and release, specific adrenal renin activity, PRA, and plasma aldosterone were measured during potassium loading or captopril treatment in the rat. Adrenal ANGs were determined using a HPLC system combined with RIA to obtain quantitative information on the components of the adrenal renin-ANG system. In addition, the effect of pretreatment with captopril on aldosterone production by isolated adrenal glomerulosa cells was examined. In intact animals potassium loading markedly increased adrenal renin and plasma aldosterone, whereas PRA was suppressed. The administration of captopril to rats in normal potassium balance did not suppress plasma aldosterone. Captopril treatment during potassium loading inhibited the potassium-induced increase in aldosterone. Furthermore, pretreatment with captopril suppressed adrenal ANG II and reduced the response of aldosterone production to extracellular potassium concentration by isolated adrenal glomerulosa cells in vitro. These results suggest that the adrenal renin-ANG system plays a significant role in the control of aldosterone production under potassium stimulation.", 
    "205": "Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE, peptidyldipeptide hydrolase, kininase II, EC 3.4.15.I) from human placenta was purified 6297-fold and characterized. ACE could be extensively purified by affinity chromatography with Captopril (D-3-mercapto-2-methylpropanoyl-L-proline), an orally active antihypertensive agent and a potent inhibitor of this enzyme. Its molecular weight and subunit size were estimated to be 300 000 by high-performance gel permeation chromatography and 85 000 by sodium dodecyl sulphate gel electrophoresis, respectively, indicating its polymeric structure.", 
    "206": "Urinary excretion of kinins in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive (SHRSP) rats was unchanged during oral enalapril (10 mg/kg) or captopril (30 mg/kg) treatment once a day for 8 days compared to vehicle treatment. However, a significant decrease in urinary kinin excretion was observed on the 5th and 7th day compared to the pretreatment value in rats treated with enalapril. Both enalapril and captopril produced a significant reduction in blood pressure when compared to the vehicle. These findings provide no positive evidence to support the hypothesis of possible involvement of renal kinins in the antihypertensive effect of converting enzyme inhibitors in SHRSP rats.", 
    "207": "Effect of subacute angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) blockade on the converting enzyme activity (ACE activity) in plasma, aorta, lung, kidney and whole brain was evaluated in chemically-sympathectomized (with 6-hydroxydopamine) normotensive Wistar Kyoto (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) using captopril given peripherally via the intraperitoneal (i.p) route and centrally through intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration. Daily i.p. injection of 25 mg/kg for 8 days reduced the blood pressure of both WKY rats and SHR, and the ACE activity in the aorta, lung and plasma of both WKY rats and SHR were correspondingly depressed. The brain ACE activity remained unaltered in both strain of rats. The ACE activity in the kidney of WKY was depressed, while that of SHR remained unchanged. These observations are independent of peripheral sympathectomy with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). Daily central captopril administration at a dose of 2 mg/kg, i.c.v., for 8 days significantly reduced the blood pressure of SHR but not WKY rats, whereas the ACE activity of the whole brain of both WKY and SHR were depressed. Central sympathectomy with 6-OHDA did not alter these responses. It is concluded that captopril exerts its antihypertensive effect not only via reduction of the ACE activity in the plasma and lungs as reported earlier, but also that of other organs, principally the aorta, and that these effects are independent of the sympathetic nervous system.", 
    "208": "The authors recently reported the development of a new method for measuring angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) by means of a highly sensitive angiotensin II RIA technique. We have carried out a comparative study of the pharmacological properties of captopril and MK-422, two ACE inhibitors recently developed as new antihypertensive agents. In this study, in vivo and in vitro animal experiments were performed using the G\u00f6ttingen Mini-pig (Mini-pig G) animal model of the human disease. In the in vivo experimental system, each drug was administered by intravenous injection at a dose of 1 mg/kg, and a slight difference was found in the time-course of the per cent inhibition of ACE in the blood. In the in vitro system (cultured aortic endothelial cells), the ACE inhibitory activities of the two drugs were compared in terms of the 50%-inhibition point on the dose response curve, and it was found that MK-422 was about 100 times more potent than captopril. These results indicate that our newly-developed experimental system can be useful in the establishment of the clinical dose of vasoactive drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "209": "We have examined the acute renal failure that occurs after uranyl nitrate administration in the rat and the specific effects of pretreatment of rats with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI), plasma volume expansion (PVE) after uranyl nitrate, and a combination of these treatments. We utilized a combination of micropuncture measurements of glomerular hemodynamics, cage studies, and histologic examination of renal tissue to evaluate the degree of acute renal failure in all groups studied. Uranyl nitrate (UN) (25 mg/kg body wt) administration caused a reduction in the nephron filtration rate (SNGFR) (39.4 +/- 1.6 to 24.8 +/- 2.9 nl X min-1 X g kidney wt-1, P less than 0.02) as a result of a major decrease in the glomerular ultrafiltration coefficient (LpA) from control values (greater than or equal to 0.085 +/- 0.008 to 0.035 +/- 0.007 nl X sec-1 X mm Hg-1 X g kidney wt-1, P less than 0.01). Treatments with CEI, PVE, and the combination of CEI and PVE in rats receiving UN restored 0.38 +/- LpA to normal values (greater than 0.061 +/- 0.009, 0.091 +/- 0.020, and 0.138 +/- 0.020 nl X sec-1 X mm Hg-1 X g kidney wt-1, respectively). Cage studies revealed that CEI treatment prevented oliguria and resulted in major volume losses and reduction in weight. However, rats died after a similar period after UN, but probably by different mechanisms. Analysis of renal ultrastructure revealed equivalent tubular damage in all experimental groups. Alterations in LpA after UN are functional in nature and are potentially preventable and reversible by a combination of treatments with CEI and PVE.", 
    "210": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are not known to have a direct effect on the myocardium. However, there is some evidence to suggest that they can play an important role in protecting the heart during the evolution of hypertensive and coronary arterial disease, both acutely and on a long term basis. Reduction of afterload by balanced arterial and venular dilatation has led to a sustained improvement of cardiac performance both in hypertension and heart failure. Reversal of cardiac hypertrophy has been shown to restore inotropic responsiveness to stimulators of the adenylate cyclase system. Following myocardial infarction, captopril has prevented undue ventricular dilatation and normalized left ventricular chamber stiffness; this prevented deterioration of cardiac function and improved long term survival after infarction. Control of secondary aldosteronism and prevention of hypokalaemia can play an important role in the prevention of cardiac arrhythmias. The lack of reflex sympathetic stimulation during long term captopril therapy can also play a favourable role in that respect. Although highly speculative, evidence is accumulating that ACE inhibition could have a cardioprotective effect in acute myocardial ischaemia. It is based on the demonstration that renin can be produced by myocardial cells, that angiotensin is liberated by the ischemic myocardium and that angiotensin in high renin conditions plays an active constrictor role in regulating the coronary circulation.", 
    "211": "Two prospective multi-centre randomized trials were initiated to compare the relative efficacy and influence on quality of life of captopril, alone or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide, against either methyldopa, alone or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide, or oxprenolol in combination with chlorothalidone. The complaint rate, activity index and psychiatric morbidity were evaluated as indices of quality of life. Captopril was associated with a significantly (P less than 0.05) greater reduction in complaint rate compared with methyldopa and a tendency for less symptoms of depression compared with oxprenolol (P = 0.06), the latter drug being associated with an increase in depression scores. The trends in quality of life indices in the captopril-treated patients would suggest the need for double-blind placebo-controlled trials to investigate these apparent benefits.", 
    "212": "The goals of antihypertensive therapy are to normalize arterial pressure and to minimize pharmacological adverse effects. Recent data indicate that in general the first goal has been achieved but the second has not, resulting in a substantial non-compliance rate. There is increasing evidence, therefore, that the next major step forward in treating hypertensive patients is to link specific forms of therapy to subsets of the hypertensive population. The present article illustrates this point by describing the characteristics and therapeutic implications of a subset of essential hypertensives termed non-modulators and the therapeutic implications which arise. These individuals have a defect in the way that sodium intake modifies adrenal and renal vascular responses to angiotensin II, resulting in an abnormality in sodium handling. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors partially, if not completely, correct this underlying defect and thereby reduce blood pressure by restoring the renal vascular responsiveness to normal. Because of the specificity of ACE inhibitors in treating non-modulators, it is to be expected that they would produce fewer long term side effects, resulting in a better quality of life for these patients than if their blood pressures were treated non-specifically.", 
    "213": "Although renin was identified as playing a part in cardiovascular homeostasis by the experiments of Goldblatt in the 1930s, neither its physiological role in organs other than the kidney nor its contribution to the genesis of essential hypertension have been defined. It is difficult to interpret studies with converting enzyme inhibitors because of their multiple pharmacological effects. Specific inhibitors of renin appropriate for clinical investigation would help to resolve many questions. Four classes of compounds have been shown to be renin inhibitors of high potency: specific antibody, general peptide inhibitors of acid proteases, analogues of angiotensinogens and peptides that are related to the amino-terminal sequence of prorenin. Of these, it is likely that angiotensinogen analogues will be the first applied in human studies. The minimal substrate for renin has the sequence: His-Pro-Phe-His-Leu-Val-Tyr. Variants of this sequence have yielded competitive inhibitors. Remarkably active compounds have recently been synthesized by reducing the peptide bond that is cleaved by renin, or by incorporating the amino acid statine, found in pepstatin. These compounds have been shown to be effective in dogs, rats and monkeys and, most recently, preliminary studies have reported their efficacy in man. Recent studies with one of these inhibitors, RIP, raise questions concerning both its specificity and site of action.", 
    "214": "The effect of the chronic administration of captopril on plasma levels of vasopressin (PVP) were studied in 14 patients with moderate essential hypertension and 10 normal volunteers. All patients were studied after 10 days without drugs and under a constant diet (120 mmol sodium and 80 mmol potassium/day). Plasma levels of renin activity (PRA), aldosterone (PA) and PVP were assayed before and after captopril treatment (50-100 mg/day for 1 month). In addition to the well-known effect of captopril treatment on PRA and PA, a statistically significant reduction of PVP was observed. This finding suggests that the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system influences vasopressin release, and its inhibitors may contribute to the absence of water retention during captopril treatment compared with the effect of other vasodilatory drugs.", 
    "215": "The activation of the renin-angiotensin system that occurs during the development of congestive heart failure (CHF) may be accompanied by continued secretion of vasopressin (AVP) in response to non-osmotic stimuli. Increased supine plasma AVP levels (by radio-immunoassay) were found in 31 patients with moderate to severe CHF (11.49 +/- 1.00 pg/ml s.e.m.) 24 h after the last diuretic dose, which correlated with plasma renin activity (PRA) (r = 0.37, P less than 0.05). However, acute inhibition of converting enzyme with captopril did not decrease plasma AVP levels (14.9 +/- 3.9 versus 14.0 +/- 2.8 pg/ml, n = 8). Indeed, in six out of eight patients, plasma AVP actually increased following captopril - presumably secondary to haemodynamic changes. Readministration of captopril after 4 months of captopril treatment, 12 h after the last dose, again did not change AVP levels (9.58 +/- 1.2 versus 13.1 +/- 1.9 pg/ml), whereas changes in haemodynamics, PRA and angiotensin II were as expected and similar to the first test. These results suggest that the acute haemodynamic action of captopril in CHF is not mediated via suppression of vasopressin, although in some patients with non-osmotic vasopressin, excess activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system might constitute a factor.", 
    "216": "High tissue levels of angiotensin II have been reported in the median eminence suggesting a possible role in the regulation of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) secretion. To verify this hypothesis in man, the pituitary-adrenal axis response to hypoglycaemia was studied before and during captopril treatment in eight male essential hypertensive patients (stage I WHO; aged 35-52 years). Plasma levels of ACTH, cortisol and glucose were measured before and 60, 90 and 120 min after an intravenous bolus of normal saline as placebo an, 3 days later, after an intravenous bolus of rapidly acting insulin (0.1 IU/kg body weight). Captopril treatment was then started and both placebo and hypoglycaemic tests were repeated 15 days thereafter. No changes in ACTH, cortisol or glucose plasma levels were observed after acute normal saline, either before or during captopril administration. On the contrary, hypoglycaemia induced a sharp increase of ACTH plasma before captopril (from 27.7 +/- 11 to 131.30 +/- 26 pg/ml, P less than 0.01, 60 min after insulin) but not during angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition (from 28.9 +/- 9 to 42.9 +/- 11 pg/ml, NS, at min 60 of the study). Our present data, showing a blunted ACTH response to hypoglycaemia during ACE inhibition, suggest that circulating angiotensin II may participate in the regulation of the release of the ACTH, possibly by a stimulation of angiotensin II receptors localized in the brain but outside the blood-brain barrier.", 
    "217": "In vitro and animal studies indicate that circulating angiotensin II (ANG II) can stimulate adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol secretion, but it is far from established that ANG II has a physiologically relevant influence on steroidogenesis. We studied the effects of hypoglycaemia induced with insulin injection (0.15 IU/kg) in patients with essential hypertension to answer this question. Hypoglycaemia was induced before and after a short term course of treatment with the converting enzyme inhibitor captopril to obtain a sustained blockade of ANG II formation. Alterations in serum glucose, plasma potassium, plasma ACTH, cortisol, renin activity and aldosterone were examined. In control studies there was a profound fall in serum glucose and plasma potassium after insulin, associated with increments in plasma renin activity, which correlated with those of aldosterone but not with those of ACTH and cortisol. Chronic captopril increased baseline plasma renin activity and lowered baseline aldosterone while leaving ACTH and cortisol unchanged. During converting enzyme inhibition the insulin-induced decrements in glucose and potassium, as well as the increments in ACTH, cortisol and aldosterone, were similar to those observed in control studies, whereas the increments in plasma renin activity were much greater. From these results it does not appear that ANG II has a relevant influence on ACTH and cortisol production, or on their responses to hypoglycaemic stress. Rather, these findings indicate that even under the present experimental conditions ANG II is the primary regulator of aldosterone secretion. However, this function can be taken over by ACTH when the generation of ANG II is blocked.", 
    "218": "It has been reported that endogenous opioid antagonism through naloxone (NAL) blunts the hypotensive effect of captopril (CAP) in normal man. For this reason a study was carried out to determine whether NAL interacts with the antihypertensive effect of CAP in patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension (n = 6; age 22-43 years). Patients received, according to a randomized code, placebo (PL) during saline infusion, CAP (25 mg orally) during saline infusion, PL + NAL (0.4 mg as a bolus followed by a continuous infusion of 4.0 mg/h for 2 h) and CAP + NAL at the same doses. Three-day intervals elapsed between each phase of the study. Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were recorded before (-20 to 0 min) and every 15 min for the next 2 h after drug administration. Blood samples for plasma renin activity (PRA), noradrenaline (NA) and aldosterone (ALD) were collected before (time 0) and 120 min after drug administration. Neither PL nor NAL changed any of the parameters examined, while CAP alone reduced mean BP to a highly significant extent. Naloxone did not change the hypotensive effect of CAP to any significant extent. Captropril, either alone or associated with NAL, tended to reduce plasma ALD and increase PRA (P less than 0.05) without changing HR or plasma NA. These data indicate that, at least under the experimental conditions used, endogenous opioid antagonism does not interfere with the haemodynamic and humoral effect of CAP in essential hypertensive man. This suggests that endogenous opioids do not mediate the pharmacological actions of CAP.", 
    "219": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) has been studied in different reproductive organs of the male rat, in somatic cell lines clonally derived from both rat and mouse testes, and in isolated spermatogenic cells of the mouse. Among the various reproductive organs only testis and epididymis show high levels of enzyme activity. The testicular activity is found mainly in the isolated germinal cells and residual bodies, whereas somatic cell lines contain negligible levels of activity even after addition of hormones and growth factors. Testicular homogenates, spermatogenic cells, epididymal spermatozoa, and spermatozoan cytoplasmic droplets, when fractionated by anion exchange chromatography, contain one major and one minor activity peak, whereas epididymal homogenates and epididymal secretions reveal an additional major activity peak together with the minor peak. All forms of ACE have a similar response to different modifiers, and are equally sensitive to the specific inhibitor N-[(S)-1-(ethoxycarbonyl)-3-phenylpropyl]-L-alanyl-L-proline (Enalapril). The testicular enzyme could provide a useful marker for spermatogenic maturation and/or cytoplasmic processes both in testis and epididymis. The separate epididymal peak is a secretory enzyme that may be responsible for the processing of spermatozoan plasma membrane constituents during epididymal transit, or may have a role in attacking some biologically active compounds.", 
    "220": "The role of angiotensin II in the development of renal wrap hypertension was studied in rabbits that underwent either bilateral renal cellophane wrap or sham operation. In half the rabbits, angiotensin II production was blocked by continuous administration of enalapril. Four weeks after renal wrapping, mean arterial pressure had risen by 48 +/- 5 mm Hg in untreated rabbits, but by only 25 +/- 4 mm Hg in enalapril-treated rabbits (p less than 0.01). Similar differences were also measured 6 weeks after wrapping. In untreated rabbits, plasma renin activity had increased fourfold 4 and 6 weeks after renal wrapping. There were no significant changes in blood pressure or plasma renin activity following sham operation. Compared with that in sham-operated rabbits, renal blood flow was reduced by 60% in the untreated rabbits 4 weeks after wrapping but by only 30% in the enalapril-treated wrapped rabbits (p less than 0.05). Renal vascular resistances were 5.5 +/- 1.7 mm Hg . ml-1 . min-1 and 1.2 +/- 0.1 mm Hg . min . ml-1 in the untreated wrapped and sham-operated rabbits respectively and 1.9 +/- 0.4 mm Hg . min . ml-1 and 0.8 +/- 1 mm Hg . min . ml-1 in the enalapril-treated wrapped and sham-operated rabbits. Renal wrapping did not alter filtration fraction in untreated rabbits, but markedly reduced it in enalapril-treated rabbits. These results suggest that angiotensin II had two major effects in rabbits after bilateral renal wrapping: it contributed substantially to the increase in blood pressure and caused renal vasoconstriction, primarily at a postglomerular site.",

    "223": "Structure 3a, a potent angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, was prepared in five steps from L-(+)-alpha-amino-4-phenylbutyric acid by construction of the activated side-chain ester 16, displacement with L-pyroglutamate ester anion, and deblocking. Diastereomer separation was accomplished by chromatography at the diester stage, 17. Pharmacological assays established that 3a parallels enalapril in its ability to inhibit converting enzyme and lower blood pressure.", 
    "224": "Placebo and enalapril were added on a double-blind basis to conventional treatment in 14 patients with congestive heart failure (CHF), New York Heart Association class II-III. The patients were followed for 14 weeks and their performance was evaluated by a treadmill test, ejection fraction by nuclear scan, cardiothoracic ratio, and Yale Scale score. Metabolic studies were done to test any adverse effects of the drugs. Enalapril decreased arterial pressure and cardiothoracic ratio, and increased ejection fraction. Placebo exerted no significant effects. However, both drugs improved treadmill time and Yale Scale score. No adverse metabolic or clinical effects were observed with either drug. Based on these limited observations we conclude that: Enalapril is a useful ancillary agent to conventional treatment of CHF; it exerts its effects through afterload and preload reduction; and it is safe and well tolerated and has a prolonged duration of action.", 
    "225": "Captopril inhibits the metabolism of endogenous opioids in vitro and potentiates their effects in vivo. We examined the hypothesis that endogenous opioids contribute to the actions of captopril in man. The acute cardiovascular and autonomic effects of oral captopril, intravenous naloxone, and their combination were examined in eight healthy men with normotension in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of a Latin squares design. Naloxone altered neither blood pressure nor heart rate. There were significant falls in systolic blood pressure during captopril dosing alone, but there was no fall in blood pressure during combination therapy. Heart rates were higher during the combination than during captopril alone. The combination caused sedation, but neither captopril nor naloxone alone had any behavioral effects. Modification of the acute circulatory effects of captopril by naloxone suggests a role for endogenous opioids in the responses to converting enzyme inhibition. The sedation caused by the combination raises the possibility that captopril may exert central nervous actions in man.", 
    "226": "Anatomical and electrophysiological evidence indicates that the kidneys contain both mechano- and chemoreceptor nerve endings. We conducted the present study to determine whether conditions of reduced renal blood flow elicit cardiovascular alterations that are dependent on afferent renal nerves. Removal of the renin-angiotensin system with the angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, and/or reduction in baroreflex gain by sinoaortic denervation, were combined in conscious rats with acute renal artery stenosis to prevent these systems from potentially obscuring any afferent renal nerve-dependent effects. One week after sinoaortic denervation or sham sinoaortic denervation, each rat was chronically instrumented with Doppler flow probes on the lower abdominal aorta and superior mesenteric and right renal arteries, as well as with intravascular catheters, and a perivascular balloon occluder on the right renal artery. After surgical recovery, sham sinoaortic-denervated animals responded to a 60-minute period of stenosis (50% reduction in renal blood flow) with increases in arterial pressure, regional resistance, and plasma renin activity. Captopril abolished the increases in arterial pressure, hindquarters, and left renal resistance, but both bradycardia and increased mesenteric resistance persisted, indicating that baroreflex activation might be buffering a non-renin-angiotensin system pro-hypertensive mechanism. In support of this, sinoaortic-denervated animals during captopril administration responded to stenosis with substantial increases in arterial pressure (25-30 mm Hg) and regional resistance (30-50%) that were unrelated to the renin-angiotensin system, but which were abolished after denervation of the stenotic kidney. The data suggest that acute reductions in renal blood flow activate an afferent renal nerve-dependent cardiovascular response that is strongly expressed under conditions of reduced gain of the renin-angiotensin and baroreflex systems. We speculate that this reflex may assume particular importance in chronic renal hypertension when baroreflexes become impaired and activation of the renin-angiotensin system is reduced.", 
    "227": "Using a new table-top electron-impact mass selective detector, interfaced with a narrow bore, fused silica capillary gas chromatograph, a method has been developed for the simultaneous determination of captopril and S-benzoyl captopril. With a capillary column the two components could be chromatographically resolved, thus permitting the use of electron-impact ionization for quantitative measurements.", 
    "228": "The renin-angiotensin system has been shown to play a significant role in maintaining blood pressure and sodium balance in health and disease states. The development of various pharmacologic probes that inhibit the RAS at different and specific points in the renin-angiotensin cascade has facilitated the elucidation of the role of angiotensin II in renovascular hypertension. In a clinical regard, inhibitors of the RAS have been instrumental in screening patients for renovascular hypertension, and in predicting curability with a high degree of reliability. Moreover, use of these drugs in an out-patient setting has been determined to be safe, practical, and reliable, making the work-up for renin-dependent hypertension cost effective and accurate.", 
    "229": "After reviewing the available data on drug-induced hyperkalemia, we conclude that the situation has not improved since Lawson quantitatively documented the substantial risks of potassium chloride over a decade ago (90). As discussed, the risk of developing hyperkalemia in hospital remains at least at the range of 1 to 2% and can reach 10%, depending on the definition used (Table 2). Potassium chloride supplements and potassium-sparing diuretics remain the major culprits but they have been joined by a host of new actors, e.g., salt substitutes, beta-blockers, converting enzyme inhibitors, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents, and heparin, among others. Readily identifiable risk factors (other than drugs) for developing hyperkalemia are well-known but seem to be consistently ignored, even in teaching hospitals. The presence of diabetes mellitus, renal insufficiency, hypoaldosteronism, and age greater than 60 years results in a substantial increase in the risk of hyperkalemia from the use of any of the drugs we have reviewed. If prevention of hyperkalemia is the goal, as it should be, the current widespread and indiscriminate use of potassium supplements and potassium-sparing diuretics will need to end. We remain intrigued by Burchell's prescient pronouncement of over a decade ago that \"more lives have been lost than saved by potassium therapy\" (28).", 
    "230": "The alpha adrenoceptor antagonists phenoxybenzamine and phentolamine are reported to have opposite effects on vasopressin release, the former inhibiting and the latter enhancing it. In this study we have assessed the functional involvement of vasopressin in the maintenance of blood pressure in conscious rats after administration of either phenoxybenzamine or phentolamine. In normal (Long-Evans) rats, phenoxybenzamine caused a small fall in arterial blood pressure, whereas phentolamine initially caused a profound hypotension which was followed by a fluctuating recovery back to normotensive levels. Similar effects were seen in rats deficient in hypothalamic vasopressin (Brattleboro strain). Administration of an antagonist of the cardiovascular actions of vasopressin [1-(beta-mercapto-beta, beta-cyclopentamethylenepropionic acid)-8-D-arginine vasopressin] in the presence of either alpha adrenoceptor antagonist alone was without effect in Long-Evans or Brattleboro rats, but, under these conditions, subsequent administration of captopril caused a profound and sustained hypotension in both strains. Administration of captopril in the presence of either alpha adrenoceptor antagonist alone caused a prompt fall in blood pressure which was sustained for the duration of the experiment in the Brattleboro rats. However, under these conditions, the blood pressure of the Long-Evans rats showed some recovery over the subsequent 45 min; this recovery was antagonized by [1-(beta-mercapto-beta, beta-cyclopentamethylenepropionic acid)-8-D-argine vasopressin]. It is concluded that after alpha adrenoceptor antagonism with either phenoxybenzamine or phentolamine, the renin-angiotensin system exerts a major pressor influence. However, after captopril administration in the presence of phenoxybenzamine or phentolamine, vasopressin contributes to the maintenance of arterial blood pressure in Long-Evans rats; the magnitude of this contribution is similar irrespective of the alpha adrenoceptor antagonist used.", 
    "231": "The effect of various doses of the new angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor HOE 498 was compared with that of placebo in patients with mild essential hypertension. When a single dose of 2.5 mg of the drug was given, blood pressure was not significantly reduced despite a fall in converting enzyme levels. Single doses of 5 or 10 mg did reduce blood pressure, but complete inhibition of converting enzyme was apparent only with the 10-mg dose. Acute administration of a 20-mg dose proved to be unsuitable, since this was associated with too large a fall in pressure and the occurrence of symptomatic orthostatic hypotension. Although converting enzyme and blood pressure tended to recover in part 12 h after administration of the drug, both variables remained low even after 48 h.", 
    "232": "When a decision to treat a given patient is taken, the embarrassing position arises of deciding which drug should first be prescribed. How can the safest choice be made? Should the physician follow a pathophysiological or an empirical approach? There is no doubt that the most rational approach would consist of matching the pharmacological properties of the drug with the pathophysiological disturbances of the patient. However, these are complex and variable, and their precise assessment in every hypertensive patient is hardly practicable. On the other hand, the pharmacological properties of drugs are often multiple, and sometimes imperfectly understood. The practical impossibility of obtaining a satisfactory pathophysiological profile of each hypertensive patient in order to choose the most suitable drug has strengthened the trend toward formulating and using stepped-care programmes. The philosophy behind these is that of lowering blood pressure with agents most likely to be effective with a minimum of untoward effects, of progressing from a simple start, generally prescribing a single drug at a low dose, to more complex therapeutic regimens. There is some evident soundness in this approach, but stepped-care programmes are sometimes criticized as dogmatic, and are contrasted with the individualized approach, the custom-tailoring provided by pathophysiological profiling. Undoubtedly, the first stepped-care programmes, as formulated in the USA in the 1970s, giving no other first choice than a thiazide diuretic, were rigid and had limitations. On the other hand, the 1978 WHO guidelines were more flexible, suggesting a first choice between either a diuretic or a beta-blocker.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "233": "Captopril (Capoten; Squibb) 100 mg was given as once-daily monotherapy in 20 patients with hypertension and hyperuricaemia. Ten patients (group A) maintained a low-sodium diet (60-100 mmol/d) throughout the study and 10 (group B) continued their usual high-sodium (200-300 mmol/d) diet. After 4 weeks of active treatment supine blood pressure in group A decreased from 192 +/- 5/119 +/- 3 mmHg to 144 +/- 3/95 +/- 3 mmHg (P less than 0,001), whereas pressures in group B varied between 168 +/- 5/115 +/- 3 mmHg and 160 +/- 6/113 +/- 4 mmHg (not significant). Serum urate values fell from 0,46 +/- 0,02 mmol/l to 0,35 +/- 0,02 mmol/l (P less than 0,001) and 0,53 +/- 0,02 mmol/l to 0,46 +/- 0,03 mmol/l (P less than 0,05) in the same groups. Captopril exerted an antihypertensive effect in patients receiving a low-sodium diet, suggesting a relationship with angiotensin II and/or aldosterone; effects on serum urate levels appeared to be independent of diet.", 
    "234": "We have investigated the extent to which captopril's short-term (1 h) effects on salt and water intake in the rat are caused by effects on taste. In single-bottle tests a low dose of captopril (0.5 mg/kg s.c.), which blocks the synthesis of angiotensin II in the blood but not the brain, increased equally the intakes of water, 0.05, 0.15, 0.30 and 0.45 M NaCl, 0.3 M KCl, 10 mM HCl, 0.14 mM quinine hydrochloride and 0.1 mM saccharin solutions without changing the animals' preference for or aversion to each with respect to water. In two-choice tests this dose increased water but not 0.15 or 0.45 M NaCl intake. A large dose of captopril (100 mg/kg s.c.), to block the synthesis of angiotensin II also in the brain, did not enhance water or NaCl intake. Neither dose affected NaCl or water intake by rats drinking in response to 2 M NaCl, 5 ml/kg i.p. We conclude that during the first hour following injection captopril has no major effect on taste perception or preference in the rat and does not stimulate sodium appetite in the sodium-replete rat. Our results support the hypothesis that low doses of captopril increase fluid intake by enhancing the synthesis of angiotensin II in the brain.", 
    "235": "An enzyme immunoassay for serum 18-hydroxycorticosterone was established using alkaline phosphatase as a label. The antiserum for 18-hydroxycorticosterone was produced by immunization of rabbits with 18-hydroxycorticosterone 3-(o-carboxymethyl) oxime conjugated to bovine serum albumin. Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography was used to separate 18-hydroxycorticosterone from other steroids in serum samples. The minimal detectable amount of 18-hydroxycorticosterone was 50 pg/tube, and the measurable range was from 5 to 1000 ng/dl when a 1.0 ml serum sample was used. Intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variance were 5.0% (n = 6), and 5.8% (n = 6), respectively. In normal controls the serum 18-hydroxycorticosterone level was 4.8 approximately 34.0 ng/dl (mean +/- S.D. = 17.1 +/- 9.0 ng/dl) on an unrestricted diet. Seven out of 8 patients with aldosterone-producing adenoma had above-normal serum 18-hydroxycorticosterone levels. Serum 18-hydroxycorticosterone increased and decreased significantly following ACTH and dexamethasone administration, respectively. In essential hypertensive patients, serum 18-hydroxycorticosterone was high during a low-sodium diet and was suppressed remarkably by captopril. These observations support the previous reports that adrenal 18-hydroxycorticosterone synthesis is dependent on both ACTH and the renin-angiotensin system. The present method is sufficiently sensitive and producible, avoids the use of radioisotopes and is quite satisfactory for clinical use.", 
    "236": "Both endopeptidase-24.11 and peptidyl dipeptidase A have previously been shown to hydrolyse the neuropeptide substance P. The structurally related peptide neurokinin A is also shown to be hydrolysed by pig kidney endopeptidase-24.11. The identified products indicated hydrolysis at two sites, Ser5-Phe6 and Gly8-Leu9, consistent with the known specificity of the enzyme. The pattern of hydrolysis of neurokinin A by synaptic membranes prepared from pig striatum was similar to that observed with purified endopeptidase-24.11, and hydrolysis was substantially abolished by the selective inhibitor phosphoramidon. Peptidyl dipeptidase A purified from pig kidney was shown to hydrolyse substance P but not neurokinin A. It is concluded that endopeptidase-24.11 has the general capacity to hydrolyse and inactivate the family of tachykinin peptides, including substance P and neurokinin A.", 
    "237": "We investigated the hypothesis that beat-to-beat variability in hemodynamic parameters reflects the dynamic interplay between ongoing perturbations to circulatory function and the compensatory response of short-term cardiovascular control systems. Spontaneous fluctuations in heart rate (HR), arterial blood pressure, and respiration were analyzed by spectral analysis in the 0.02- to 1-Hz frequency range. A simple closed-loop model of short-term cardiovascular control was proposed and evaluated in a series of experiments: pharmacological blockades of the parasympathetic, alpha-sympathetic, beta-sympathetic, and renin-angiotensin systems were used to open the principal control loops in order to examine changes in the spectral pattern of the fluctuations. Atrial pacing was used to examine blood pressure variability in the absence of HR variability. We found that respiratory frequency fluctuations in HR are parasympathetically mediated and that blood pressure fluctuations at this frequency result almost entirely from the direct effect of centrally mediated HR fluctuations. The sympathetic nervous system appears to be too sluggish to mediate respiratory frequency variations. Low-frequency (0.02-0.09 Hz) fluctuations in HR are jointly mediated by the parasympathetic and beta-sympathetic systems and appear to compensate for blood pressure fluctuations at this frequency. Low-frequency blood pressure fluctuations are probably due to variability in vasomotor activity which is normally damped by renin-angiotensin system activity. Blockade of the alpha-adrenergic system, however, does not significantly alter low-frequency blood pressure fluctuations.", 
    "238": "Two-kidney, one-clip Goldblatt models were created in Wistar rats by placing a stenotic clip around the left renal artery. A converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril was started just after operation (group 1), 4 weeks (group 2) or 12 weeks after operation (group 3). The plasma and renal renin activity (PRA and RRA) were measured by radioimmunoassay. Group 1 rats, being normotensive during captopril treatment, developed hypertension after cessation of captopril. The PRA was normal, while the RRA of ischemic kidneys was higher than that of the opposite kidneys. In group 3 rats captopril corrected hypertension in 4 of 6 rats. Although after 3 months their PRA was elevated, no difference was found in the renin content of kidneys. Group 2 rats sustained hypertension despite continued captopril treatment. These data suggest that in the early and chronic stage of this type of renovascular hypertension the renin-angiotensin system may play a major role in initiating and maintaining hypertension. In the intermediate stage (group 2), another mechanism may be involved since captopril had no effect while the pattern of the PRA and RRA of group 2 was almost the same as that of group 1.", 
    "239": "Blood pressure responsiveness to iv noradrenaline and angiotensin II was studied in conscious, freely moving, age-matched spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats from 4 to 16 weeks of age. At 4 and 6 weeks the SHR showed small, but nonsignificant increases in responsiveness compared with WKY to both noradrenaline and angiotensin II. At 8 weeks they exhibited similar responses to the WKY. Subsequently, at 12 and 16 weeks decreased responsiveness to noradrenaline (nonsignificant) and angiotensin II (p less than 0.05 at 12 and 16 weeks) was observed in SHR versus WKY. At 16 weeks of age, hexamethonium caused potentiation of the blood pressure response to noradrenaline and angiotensin II, but to the same degree in the two strains. Captopril at this age did not elicit potentiation to noradrenaline or angiotensin II in either strain. These results indicate that there is no rise in blood pressure responsiveness to circulating pressor agents, parallel to the development of hypertension in SHR. Increased receptor occupancy or more active attenuating reflexes in SHR versus WKY appear not to be involved in the absence of hyperresponsiveness in intact conscious SHR at 16 weeks of age.", 
    "240": "The effect of captopril mediated afterload reduction on aortic regurgitation was investigated in 10 patients. Regurgitation was quantitated by means of the regurgitation fraction and the relation of regurgitant volume to end diastolic volume. These variables were derived from gated radionuclide ventriculography. After captopril treatment the blood concentration of angiotensin I rose whereas that of angiotensin II fell significantly. The conversion of angiotensin I to II was reduced to about 50% of the control value. Whereas blood pressure and heart rate did not change significantly, the regurgitation fraction and the regurgitant volume, normalised to end diastolic volume, were significantly reduced by captopril treatment. The ejection fraction remained essentially unchanged. These findings suggest that captopril reduces aortic regurgitation by reducing afterload.", 
    "241": "The influence of endogenous angiotensin II on the hemodynamic responses to electrical stimulation of the sympathetic outflow was assessed in pithed male normotensive Wistar rats fitted with aortic flow probes for continuous measurement of cardiac output (CO). The frequency-related increments (0.25-4.0 Hz) in blood pressure (BP) and total peripheral resistance (TPR) were significantly attenuated by treating animals with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (5 mg/kg i.v.) or the angiotensin II receptor antagonist saralasin (10 micrograms/kg/min i.v.). However, the increments in CO and heart rate during neural stimulation were unaffected by blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. After captopril treatment, infusion of angiotensin II (40 ng/kg/min i.v.) to replace the loss of endogenous angiotensin II restored stimulation-induced TPR and BP responses toward precaptopril levels; CO and heart rate responses to stimulation were not altered. The hemodynamic responses to exogenous norepinephrine were affected by inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system with captopril and saralasin in a manner analogous to the neurally mediated responses. The results obtained with nerve stimulation and norepinephrine indicate that endogenous angiotensin II selectively interacted with sympathetic neural control of vascular resistance, whereas cardiac responsiveness to noradrenergic neurons was not altered. Moreover, in the absence of nerve stimulation, the antagonism of the renin-angiotensin system lowered base-line BP by reducing CO without measurably affecting TPR. Infusion of angiotensin II reversed these effects and restored BP toward precaptopril levels by increasing CO without measurably affecting TPR.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "242": "The plasma concentration and urinary excretion of a newly developed angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor, alacepril (which is converted to captopril after absorption), were investigated in seven normal healthy subjects. Fifty milligrams of the drug was administered orally either in the fasting or in the fed state. In the fasting state, the time of maximal plasma concentration (tmax) was 1 hour for free captopril, 1.7 hours for protein-conjugated captopril, and 1.6 hours for total captopril. The biologic t1/2 of free, protein-conjugated, and total captopril was 1.9, 4.2, and 5 hours, respectively. In the fed state, neither tmax nor t1/2 changed, except that the tmax of free captopril was prolonged to 1.9 hours (P less than 0.01). Cumulative urinary excretion of free captopril at 8 hours was 35% of the drug administered in the fasting state and that of total captopril at 24 hours was 59%. These data did not differ significantly from those obtained after food intake. The biologic t1/2 of free captopril after alacepril dosing was longer than in previous studies of captopril per se. Because biologic or clinical effects have not been studied, it should be left conjectural whether alacepril is a longer-acting angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor. A prolonged effect of the drug can be expected by its administration after a meal.", 
    "243": "In a double blind study, 104 hypertensive patients were randomly allocated to two different stepped care programs for 6 months. Following a placebo run-in-phase, patients were given either Enalapril (EN) 20 mg once-a-day, or a Placebo (PL). Drugs were added as follow in a parallel stepwise sequence, until the goal blood pressure was obtained. First Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) and then, if necessary, Oxprenolol (OXP) and Dihydralazine (DIH). The two goals of this study were to lower diastolic blood pressure below 90 mmHg and to maintain plasma potassium above 3.5 mmol/l. Amiloride was prescribed if plasma potassium was lower than 3.5 mmol/l. At the end of the study the EN group's blood pressure was 130 +/- 12/83 +/- 6 mmHg, the tablet's daily number was 2.6 +/- 1.8 and Amiloride was necessary in 15 patients. These parameters were significantly different from those observed in the Pl group (BP: 136 +/- 9/87 +/- 5 mmHg, tablets 4.2 +/- 2.4; amiloride necessary in 34 patients). The effects of HCTZ were evaluated in 32 patients previously treated by EN compared to 39 patients receiving PL. The converting enzyme inhibition minimized the fall in plasma potassium induced by HCTZ (3.6 t +/- 0.4 vs 3.3 +/- 0.5 mmol/l, p less than 0.05). Related to the HCTZ dose (mg/kg), the plasma potassium fall is lower in the EN group (0.46 +/- 1.1) than in the PL group (0.94 +/- 0.9, p less than 0.05). The plasma potassium reduction could not be predicted by age, plasma renin activity, plasma and urinary aldosterone or urinary kallikrein.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "244": "The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity in tissues and plasma renin activity (PRA) were measured in 2-kidney, 1-clip renal hypertensive rats (2K-RHR) and normotensive rats after a single and 3-weeks oral administrations of ACE inhibitors such as MK-421 and captopril. In the single dose study, MK-421 (1 and 3 mg/kg) and captopril (3 and 10 mg/kg) inhibited the ACE activities in kidney, aorta and plasma in a dose-dependent fashion. The inhibition of ACE activity in kidney or aorta was observed for a longer time than that in plasma. PRA took a time course reversal to that of plasma ACE activity. In the 3-weeks repeated dose study, the ACE activity in kidney and aorta was strongly inhibited after the administration of each ACE inhibitor, while there was no significant change in lung ACE activity at any time point examined. The plasma ACE activity markedly elevated after the administration of each agent. PRA significantly increased after the administration of either agent, while the plasma angiotensin II level was significantly inhibited. These results indicate that the inhibition of the ACE activity in blood vessel or kidney correlate well with the antihypertensive activity in 2K-RHR after a single and repeated administration of both ACE inhibitors, but not well with the inhibition of plasma ACE activity.", 
    "245": "In the single dose study, the aortic blood pressure in conscious normotensive rats, 2-kidney, 1-clip renal hypertensive rats (2K-RHR), 1-kidney, 1-clip renal hypertensive rats (1K-RHR) or DOCA hypertensive rats was measured for 24 hr after the oral administration of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors such as MK-421 or captopril. MK-421 at 3 mg/kg and captopril at 10 mg/kg markedly lowered the blood pressure of 2K-RHR. MK-421 at 10 mg/kg and captopril at 30 mg/kg only modestly lowered the blood pressure of 1K-RHR. In contrast, both ACE inhibitors failed to reduce blood pressure in DOCA and normotensive rats. In the repeated dose study, the systolic blood pressures in normotensive rats, 2K-RHR or spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were measured twice a week for 3 weeks treatment of either MK-421 at 3 mg/kg or captopril at 10 mg/kg. Both ACE inhibitors produced significant antihypertensive effects in these model rats, and the effects were sustained throughout the treatment period. The antihypertensive effects in 2K-RHR were greater than those in SHR and normotensive rats. These results indicate that MK-421 and captopril cause the most significant antihypertensive effect in 2K-RHR in which the renin-angiotensin system played a dominant role in blood pressure regulation. The antihypertensive effect of MK-421 was approximately 3 times as potent as that of captopril in these hypertensive models.", 
    "246": "Orally-active angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are rapidly establishing themselves in the therapy of hypertension and congestive heart failure. Concerted efforts in a number of laboratories have now led to the discovery or synthesis of an unparalleled variety of potent inhibitors. The manner in which several of these inhibitors bind to ACE is beginning to be understood. It is hoped that some of the insights to be derived from the SAR and structural studies done with ACE inhibitors will be applicable to other enzyme targets as well. The success of ACE inhibitors as pharmacological tools and in the clinic will also quite certainly encourage future efforts to develop new enzyme inhibitor approaches to drug therapy.", 
    "247": "The function of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is influenced by changes in sodium balance and angiotensin II (ANG II) levels. In previous studies it has been difficult to assess the physiological effects on blood pressure homeostasis of different rates of ANG II infusion and of different levels of sodium in the diet. The present study examined the quantitative effects of ANG II in conscious dogs on low, normal and high sodium intake with the endogenous RAS blocked by continuous intravenous infusion of enalapril [MK-421,N-(1(S)-carbethoxy-3-phenyl propyl)-L-alanyl-L-proline maleate]. Conscious dogs on three different sodium diets, low, normal and high (5, 30 and 250 mmol/day), were infused continuously with enalapril, 4 mg/kg/day, and studied with superinfused ANG II at rates of 0, 1, 3, 6 and 12 ng/kg/min, each period lasting 1 week. Converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI) decreased mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) equally in dogs on low and normal sodium intake by 20 mmHg, but did not have a significant effect in dogs on high sodium intake. The initial infusion of ANG II at the lowest rate had a pronounced effect on MAP in dogs on normal and high sodium, but had no effect in the sodium depleted dogs. However, at the higher rates of infusion, the angiotensin increased the pressure equally at all levels of sodium intake.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "248": "Twenty five patients with chronic congestive cardiac failure had enalapril (n = 13) or placebo (n = 12) added to their existing regimen of digoxin and frusemide in a randomised double blind trial. Four hours after the first 5 mg dose, the enalapril group showed significant falls in blood pressure, heart rate, and concentrations of plasma angiotensin II, angiotensin converting enzyme, and noradrenaline. During the 12 week trial heart failure became worse in one enalapril treated patient (8%) and in seven placebo treated patients (58%). There were no significant changes in cardiac ejection fraction or exercise duration in either group. Plasma noradrenaline response to graded exercise and maximum exercise rate-pressure product were significantly reduced after four and 12 weeks of active treatment but unchanged with placebo treatment. There was a sustained increase in plasma potassium and a slight rise in plasma creatinine in the enalapril group. Plasma concentrations of the active drug, enalaprilate, were dose related and log enalaprilate correlated significantly with percentage of plasma angiotensin converting enzyme activity (r = -0.66). Enalapril was well tolerated and produced no adverse effects. The drug appears to be superior to placebo and offers considerable promise for the treatment of this condition.", 
    "249": "Enalapril is a new, oral, long-acting nonsulfhydral angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. Thirty-nine patients with primary hypertension were entered into a randomized, double-blind protocol to assess the efficacy of enalapril (10 to 20 mg bid), hydrochlorothiazide (25 to 50 mg bid), or combined drug therapy. Enalapril, either alone or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide, effectively controlled blood pressure. Enalapril monotherapy was associated with an increase in plasma renin activity and a decrease in angiotensin II concentration; in patients with an initial inulin clearance less than or equal to 80 mL/min/1.73 m2, inulin and para-aminohippurate clearances were markedly improved, without producing adverse effects on salt and water excretion or body fluid composition. Combination therapy was associated with a marked increase in plasma renin activity; however, only those patients with an initial inulin clearance less than or equal to 80 mL/min/1.73 m2 demonstrated suppression of angiotensin II concentration and marked improvement in inulin and para-aminohippurate clearances. These observations suggest that enalapril, either alone or in combination with a diuretic, has the potential to reverse renal function abnormalities encountered in the hypertensive state.",

Additionally, 14c lowered blood pressure in the spontaneous hypertensive rat (SHR) by 35 mmHg, at a dose of 10 mg/kg po.", 
    "251": "Syntheses of the potent angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (3S)-1-(carboxymethyl)-3-[[(1S)-1-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl]amino]- 2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-[1]benzazepin-2-one (4b; CGS 14831) and the related monoester prodrug (17a; CGS 14824A) are described together with preparative details for six- and eight-membered ring analogues. Inhibitory potencies and in vivo biological activity of the compounds are discussed. The data indicate that 17a has a biological profile comparable to that of enalapril.", 
    "252": "The rate of loss of phenol or 4-nitrophenol from N alpha-(diphenoxyphosphoryl)-L-alanyl-L-proline (2), N alpha-[bis(4-nitrophenoxy)phosphoryl]-L-alanyl-L-proline (5), and N alpha-[(2-phenylethyl)phenoxyphosphoryl]-L-alanyl-L-proline (12) was determined spectrophotometrically at pH 7.5 and 37 degrees C in both Tris and phosphate buffers. These moderately potent inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme (Ki greater than 0.8 microM) all hydrolyze, losing 1 mol of phenol to yield highly potent inhibitors (Ki = 0.5-18 nM). The half-times for loss of 1 mol of phenol in Tris buffer are 22 days (2), 3.4 h (5), and 21 days (12). The half-times in phosphate buffer were not significantly different. The mono(4-nitrophenoxy) ester 6 (Ki = 18 nM) loses its 1 mol of nitrophenol with a half-time of 35 h to yield N alpha-phosphoryl-L-alanyl-L-proline 16 (Ki = 1.4 nM), which hydrolyzes at the P-N bond with a half-time of 2.2 h. Hydrolysis of the P-N bond in 2 and 12 was not observed during the time course of the kinetic experiments. The two phosphoramidate diesters 2 and 5 and the phosphonamidate monoester 12 thus release powerful inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme with a known time course at physiological pH and temperature in vitro. A time-dependent increase in inhibitory potency against converting enzyme that paralleled the kinetics of phenyl ester hydrolysis was confirmed in vitro.", 
    "253": "We measured serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity radiometrically as a possible indicator of reduced thyroid function in 57 euthyroid controls, 27 patients in a noncardiac intensive care unit (13 with medical and 14 with surgical disorders), and 29 patients having coronary artery bypass grafting. In the last group, blood was obtained preoperatively and one day and one month after surgery (group 1; n = 18) or preoperatively and six hours and one day after surgery (group 2; n = 11). Patients in group 1 had significant reductions in levels of serum thyroxine (T4), triiodothyronine (T3), and thyrotropin response to protirelin one day postoperatively. The ACE activity fell significantly. Patients in group 2 had low levels of T4, T3, thyrotropin, and ACE six hours postoperatively. All these levels remained low the next day, and free T4 and free T3 levels were also reduced; the reverse T3 level became elevated. Changes in ACE significantly paralleled changes in T3. The 27 patients without coronary artery bypass grafting also had significant reductions in serum T4, T3, and ACE levels. Dilution studies and dialysis of serum with low ACE activity failed to demonstrate an inhibitor to explain the reduced enzyme function.", 
    "254": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether Captopril (an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor) or D-penicillamine (an inhibitor of collagen crosslinking) can ameliorate pulmonary fibrosis induced by the plant alkaloid monocrotaline. Rats were randomly assigned to one of six treatment groups: (1) control; (2) Captopril, 60 mg/kg/day, p.o.; (3) D-penicillamine, 30 mg/kg/day, p.o.; (4) monocrotaline, 2.4 mg/kg/day, p.o.; (5) monocrotaline plus Captopril, as above; (6) monocrotaline plus penicillamine, as above; and were killed after 6 weeks of continuous drug administration. Monocrotaline-treated rats exhibited several anatomic correlates of pulmonary hypertension, including cardiomegaly, right heart enlargement, and muscularization of the pulmonary arteries and arterioles. These monocrotaline reactions were accompanied by decreased lung activities of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and plasminogen activator (PLA), indicative of endothelial dysfunction; and by increased lung hydroxyproline concentration, indicative of interstitial fibrosis. The presence of interstitial fibrosis was confirmed by electron microscopy. When given concomitantly with monocrotaline, both Captopril and penicillamine partially prevented the cardiomegaly, right heart enlargement, and vascular muscularization. Both agents also diminished the decreased lung PLA activity and increased hydroxyproline concentration observed in monocrotaline-treated animals. Neither modifying agent influenced the monocrotaline-induced decrease in lung ACE activity. Compared with control rats, the rats receiving Captopril alone exhibited decreased heart weight and increased serum ACE activity, and animals receiving penicillamine alone did not differ significantly from control animals for any of the endpoints studied. These data demonstrate that Captopril and penicillamine ameliorate monocrotaline-induced pulmonary fibrosis in rats. Penicillamine, known to inhibit radiation-induced lung injury, thus is shown to be effective in a second model of pulmonary fibrosis. Perhaps more importantly, the hydroxyproline data demonstrate that the ACE inhibitor Captropril exhibits antifibrotic activity in monocrotaline-treated rat lung.", 
    "255": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, EC 3.14.5.1) is found in particulate fractions of the epididymis but not in soluble epididymal fractions or in the testis of 4-week-old rats. [3H]Captopril autoradiography of testis and epididymis from 4-week-old rats confirms the association of ACE with epididymal ducts but not the testis. ACE appears in the testis between 4 and 6 weeks of age. Soluble ACE is not detectable in the epididymis until 6-7 weeks of age. Within the epididymis, regions closest to the testis develop soluble ACE activity about 1 week before those nearest to the vas deferens. Hypophysectomy of 10 week-old-rats depletes greater than 95% of ACE activity from the testis and soluble fractions of the epididymis, with little change in ACE levels from particulate fractions of the epididymis. [3H]Captopril autoradiography after hypophysectomy reveals luminal and epithelial ACE in the epididymis. The presence of particulate ACE in the epididymis under conditions where there is no testicular ACE indicates that the two forms are synthesized separately. However, soluble ACE from the epididymis might be derived from the membrane-associated ACE of the testis. Such a relationship is supported by the lag of 1 week between the development of ACE in the initial segment of the epididymis and the tail of the epididymis, and by the occurrence of soluble epididymis ACE only in those animals with testicular ACE activity.", 
    "256": "Renal and systemic hemodynamics were measured during titration of dopamine and serially after intravenous administration of enalaprilat in nine patients with chronic severe congestive heart failure. During titration of dopamine, renal blood flow increased by 99%, from 304 +/- 120 to 604 +/- 234 ml/min (p less than .01) at a dose of dopamine of 2.1 micrograms/kg/min, which produced only a 21% increase in cardiac index, from 1.96 +/- 0.36 to 2.38 +/- 0.35 liters/min/m2 (p less than .05). Cardiac index was increased maximally at a dose of 4.0 micrograms/kg/min dopamine; however, renal blood flow was not further augmented. In contrast, after intravenous administration of enalaprilat, peak improvement of renal blood flow and cardiac index occurred concomitantly. Renal blood flow increased by 35%, from 316 +/- 97 to 427 +/- 107 ml/min (p less than .05), and cardiac index increased by 18%, from 1.99 +/- 0.40 to 2.35 +/- 0.40 liters/min/m2 (p less than .05). At similar increases in cardiac index, dopamine produced a greater increase in renal blood flow than enalaprilat: 604 +/- 234 vs 427 +/- 107 ml/min (p less than .05). Mean systemic arterial pressure, however, was greater with dopamine than with enalaprilat (78.1 +/- 16.7 vs 70.2 +/- 17.2 mm Hg; p less than .05) at peak effect. Thus, although both drugs appear to be potent renal vasodilators in patients with severe congestive heart failure, dopamine may be more effective in augmenting renal blood flow.", 
    "257": "Right ventricular (RV) coronary circulation in systemic hypertension offers an opportunity to assess the effects of marked increases in coronary perfusion pressure in vivo without appreciable increases in workload or marked hypertrophy of the cardiac chamber. This study investigates RV coronary circulation in renal hypertensive rats (RHR). Mean arterial pressure rose by 50% to 60% in RHR as compared to control groups and RV mass increased by 15% (7.15 vs 6.19 mg/gm body weight, p less than 0.01). Coronary blood flow, which was measured by left atrial injection of microspheres in conscious rats, was not significantly different between study groups both at rest and after maximal coronary vasodilation with carbochrome (6 mg/kg). However, minimal RV coronary resistance level per gram were significantly elevated (p less than 0.05) in RHR. A second study was designed to further dissociate the effects of arterial hypertension from the effects of changes in RV mass in RHR. In one group, blood pressure was acutely reduced by 1 week of captopril therapy, while RV mass remained high. In the second group, captopril was discontinued after 14 weeks of treatment, allowing arterial pressure to rise, while RV mass, which had regressed with treatment, remained normal. After treatment, RV minimal coronary resistance levels remained high in the short-term-treated hypertensive rats, but returned to normal levels in the long-term-treated RHR. These results suggest the following possibilities: the RV is not immune to the effects of systemic hypertension, coronary structural changes are probably the main factor that accounts for the increase in RV coronary resistance levels, and coronary alterations are amenable to long-term antihypertensive therapy.", 
    "258": "The activity of the angiotensin I converting enzyme was measured in 55 patients with untreated essential hypertension, 11 patients with untreated renovascular hypertension, five patients with untreated primary aldosteronism, and 23 normotensive subjects. Converting enzyme activity was significantly higher (p less than 0.025 or less) in essential hypertension (28 +/- 1 units/ml) and renovascular hypertension (28.5 +/- 3 units/ml) when compared with the activity in the normotensive subjects (21 +/- 1.5 units/ml). Seventeen (31 percent) of the patients with essential hypertension and three (27 percent) patients with renovascular hypertension had an elevated converting enzyme activity above the mean +2 standard deviations value of the normotensive subjects (32.8 units/ml), ranging from 33 to 55.8 units/ml. Converting enzyme activity was similar in black and white patients and in male and female patients, but it tended to decrease with increasing age in both the hypertensive and the normotensive subjects. In the untreated patients with essential hypertension (n = 55), converting enzyme activity was inversely related to mean arterial pressure and age (r = -0.34, p less than 0.01) and positively related to plasma renin activity (r = 0.31, p less than 0.05). Converting enzyme activity was always decreased during captopril therapy, and it was not affected by beta blockers, but it was increased by diuretics. These findings indicate that converting enzyme activity is elevated in patients with essential and renovascular hypertension.", 
    "259": "Major developments in the use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition for the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure have occurred since the discovery of captopril in June 1975. Early in the past decade, this oral ACE inhibitor was restricted to refractory and severe cases of hypertension. By July 1985, the Food and Drug Administration approved its use not only for all degrees of hypertension but also for the initial treatment of hypertensive patients with uncomplicated disease. New information has confirmed the effectiveness of twice-daily administration (which favorably influences compliance) and the lack of a need to monitor blood or urine levels to assure safety. The renin-mediated and non-renin-mediated mechanisms of action of captopril-induced ACE inhibition have been fully delineated, as has its side effect profile, which does not include various CNS, sympathetic reflex, and metabolic side effects seen with other antihypertensive agents. As the first vasodilator to prove its efficacy in the acute and chronic treatment of congestive heart failure to the FDA, captopril is now widely used throughout the United States. ACE inhibition reduces symptoms, enhances exercise capacity, and favorably affects sodium, water, and potassium homeostasis in patients with heart failure. Also, recent but as yet unconfirmed evidence suggests that ACE inhibition may prolong survival in these patients. The success of captopril, the first oral agent of this class, promises to hold true for other ACE inhibitors (such as enalapril), which have similar activities but differing pharmacokinetic properties and will soon be available for clinical use. Further information on these newer agents is anxiously awaited. In the near future, the clinician will undoubtedly be able to choose from a large selection of ACE inhibitors for the treatment of hypertension and heart failure. Therefore, it is important to learn about any meaningful differences among ACE inhibitors and to contrast this class of agents with older, standard therapies. This learning process is crucial as we assess whether newer agents offer clinical advantages over the old.", 
    "260": "The effect of captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, on the progression of chronic renal disease was studied in rats subjected to partial nephrectomy. Following ablation of approximately 70% of their renal mass, rats were divided into three treatment groups: group I received a placebo treatment; group II received daily po administrations of captopril; group III received captopril at the same dosage schedule as group II, but the drug was not given for 4 weeks in the middle of the treatment period. Measurements of renal function were performed at 4-week intervals, and light microscopic evaluation of the remnant kidneys was performed following 19 weeks of treatment. Deterioration of renal function, as measured by endogenous creatinine clearance, plasma creatinine, and plasma urea nitrogen, progressed more rapidly in group I than the other two groups. Twenty-four-hour urinary protein excretion was higher in group I than the others, except in group III following the 4-week period when captopril was not administered. Morphologic damage in the remnant kidney was significantly greater in group I than group II (p = 0.007). The renal lesions in the rats of group III were intermediate in severity. Histopathologic ranking of the remnant kidneys was correlated with antemortem laboratory parameters (r greater than or equal to 0.50; p less than 0.05). In a second experiment, similarly nephrectomized rats receiving po captopril daily had significantly longer survival, at 260 days, postnephrectomy than rats receiving a placebo (p = 0.0045). We conclude that captopril retards the progression of renal damage and increases survival time in this model of chronic renal disease. The mechanism may involve the alteration of potentially harmful intraglomerular hemodynamic changes which occur in the remnant kidney model.", 
    "261": "Systemic hypertension does not always reflect concomitant glomerular hypertension. At similar levels of systemic hypertension, glomerular injury occurs only in kidneys that lack protective preglomerular vasoconstriction, which results in glomerular hypertension. indeed, glomerular hypertension and glomerular injury do not develop in rats with spontaneous hypertension that have effective preglomerular vasoconstriction. In the experiments reported herein, the normal adaptive response (afferent arteriolar dilation) to a reduction of one and five-sixths of the renal mass in rats with spontaneous hypertension was examined to ascertain whether that response would expose the remaining nephrons to the injurious effects of high perfusion pressure. In addition, the efficacies of two different antihypertensive regimens were compared. Rats with spontaneous hypertension received either no therapy, or a combination of hydralazine, reserpine, and hydrochlorothiazide, or the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril. Three weeks after ablation of one and five-sixths of the renal mass, blood pressure, glomerular filtration rate, urinary protein excretion, and histologic injury scores for mesangial expansion and glomerulosclerosis were determined. Untreated rats with hypertension had severe glomerulosclerosis and mesangial expansion. Both antihypertensive regimens normalized systemic blood pressure and reduced glomerulosclerosis. However, enalapril was more effective than the combination of hydralazine, reserpine, and hydrochlorothiazide in reducing the exaggerated glomerular filtration rate (0.52 +/- 0.40 versus 0.82 +/- 0.10 ml per minute; p less than 0.05), the injury score for mesangial expansion (79 versus 103; p less than 0.05), and the degree of proteinuria (32 +/- 4 versus 42 +/- 3 mg per 24 hours; p less than 0.05). Persistence of hyperfiltration accompanied by increased mesangial expansion, may lead to progression of glomerular damage despite \"adequate\" control of systemic hypertension, as observed in rats treated with a combination of hydralazine, reserpine, and hydrochlorothiazide.", 
    "262": "Sustained increases in glomerular capillary pressure and flow accompany systemic hypertension in rats that have undergone extensive ablation of the renal mass. These intrarenal hemodynamic changes are, in turn, associated with the progressive development of proteinuria and glomerular sclerosis, leading ultimately to failure of remnant nephron units. The efficacy of antihypertensive therapy with enalapril was evaluated in this animal model of chronic renal insufficiency. A dose of enalapril sufficient to prevent systemic hypertension normalized the glomerular capillary pressure without reducing the glomerular filtration rate in the remnant kidney. Maintenance of normal capillary pressure markedly reduced the development of proteinuria and sclerotic lesions in remnant glomeruli. These results suggest that antihypertensive therapy directed at reducing the glomerular capillary pressure could retard the progressive loss of renal function in patients whose functional renal mass has been reduced by disease.", 
    "263": "In 40 to 50 percent of the essential hypertensive population, a high intake of sodium does not increase renal blood flow. These patients have been called \"non-modulators\" since their adrenal and renal vascular responses to angiotensin II are not modified by changes in sodium intake. To determine if these patients form a distinct subgroup, the frequency distribution of four characteristics that have been reported to be abnormal in non-modulators were analyzed: aldosterone secretory response to acute volume depletion, plasma aldosterone response to angiotensin II infusion, plasma renin activity response to saline infusion, and renal blood flow response to salt loading. All four characteristics had a bimodal distribution in patients with hypertension. The effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition on two of these abnormalities was also reviewed. In both cases--aldosterone secretory response to angiotensin II and renal blood flow response to salt loading--converting enzyme inhibition restored the abnormal responses towards normal values in non-modulators without altering the responses in normotensives or modulators. Indeed, the correction of the abnormal renal blood flow response to salt loading through converting enzyme inhibition may explain how converting enzyme inhibitors normalize blood pressure in 50 percent of the patients in whom the renin-angiotensin system is suppressed by an unrestricted, typically high, intake of salt. In summary, non-modulators are a distinct subset of the hypertensive population. Converting enzyme inhibition corrects the abnormalities that may be responsible for their hypertensive condition and, therefore, may be a specific form of therapy for these patients.", 
    "264": "Renal function and antihypertensive drug efficacy were determined in a prospective, double-blind, multicenter study comparing enalapril plus hydrochlorothiazide with standard triple therapy (hydrochlorothiazide, timolol, and hydralazine) in 75 patients with documented renovascular hypertension. Both groups had significant mean decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Effective control of diastolic hypertension occurred in 96 percent of patients receiving enalapril compared with 82 percent of patients receiving the triple-drug regimen. Effective renal plasma flow was significantly increased by enalapril therapy. In contrast, the glomerular filtration rate had a bimodal response. In 80 percent of enalapril-treated patients, there was no significant change in the inulin clearance, although in 20 percent of patients (10), there was a 28 percent decrease in the inulin clearance with a concomitant 12 percent increase in renal plasma flow. Seven of the 10 patients had unilateral renal artery stenosis, but in all 10, it was high-grade stenosis (more than 80 to 90 percent stenosis). Although a significant rise in the serum creatinine level occurred in one patient in association with diuretic therapy, volume repletion reversed this azotemia. No oliguric acute renal failure occurred in the enalapril-treated group. The cause of the decrease in glomerular filtration rate induced by enalapril plus hydrochlorothiazide in a minority of patients with renal artery stenosis appears to be quite complex. Although the abolishment of the autoregulation of glomerular filtration secondary to blockage of angiotensin II appears to be a primary cause, the roles of decreased arterial pressure, renal counterbalance, concurrent diuretic therapy, and other hemodynamic factors that may maintain glomerular ultrafiltration pressure must also be considered. The results of this study show that enalapril plus hydrochlorothiazide is effective in treating renovascular hypertension. Special care is needed for a small group of patients with renovascular hypertension in whom there is a decrease in the glomerular filtration rate with this therapy. This may identify a subset of patients with unilateral or bilateral high-grade renal artery stenosis in whom alternative therapy--percutaneous angioplasty or surgical intervention--may be considered.", 
    "265": "Enalapril (at a mean dose of 25 mg), a potent, long-acting angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, was prescribed in combination with hydrochlorothiazide (at a mean dose of 64 mg) for 96 weeks in 11 patients with essential hypertension who had pretreatment (placebo) glomerular filtration rates of less than 80 ml/minute/1.73 m2. Blood pressure was well controlled. After 56 weeks of therapy, glomerular filtration rate (assessed by inulin clearance) increased 55 percent and effective renal plasma flow (assessed by para-amino-hippurate clearance) increased by 32 percent; these increases were sustained through the 96 weeks of therapy. Furthermore, gains in renal function were sustained without adversely affecting 24-hour urinary protein excretion, sodium excretion, or body fluid composition. These results suggest that enalapril, in combination with hydrochlorothiazide, has the pharmacologic capability to favorably modify a primary pathophysiologic characteristic of essential hypertension by decreasing renal vascular and mesangial tone.", 
    "266": "Titrations of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE; E.C. 3.4.15.1) present in human serum, as well as in homogenates prepared from post-mortem human caudate or mouse (C57BL1/6J) whole brain tissue, were performed with the selective ACE inhibitors, captopril (SQ 14225) and teprotide (SQ 20881). ACE activity present in human serum was more sensitive to inhibition by either inhibitor than the activity present in the brain homogenates. The inhibition curves for the titration of the human serum activity by both inhibitors were sigmoidal while the inhibition curves for the ACE activity present in the brain homogenates were more complex. These results suggest that the brain homogenates contained: at least two species of enzyme activity with properties similar to ACE but with differing affinities for the inhibitors, or substances without ACE activity that are capable of competing with ACE for the binding of the inhibitors. Therefore, measurements of captopril or teprotide-sensitive peptidase activity as well as inhibitor-binding activity may not always reflect ACE concentrations in brain tissue.", 
    "267": "The introduction of angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors into the analysis of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) had broadened our knowledge of the integral role of renin and the kidney in circulatory homeostasis and has provided a pathophysiologically based concept for the treatment of hypertension. When the RAS is activated, as it is when sodium is restricted, the renal blood supply shows the most striking vasodilatation among vascular beds assessed after ACE-inhibition. Sodium excretion rises, there is a fall in blood-pressure, and plasma concentrations of angiotensin II (AII) and aldosterone are reduced. Conversely, with sodium loading the hemodynamic and hormonal effects of ACE-inhibitors are small. In 50-60% of normal or high-renin patients with essential hypertension ACE-inhibitors induce a potentiated acute renal response: renal blood flow and sodium excretion increase more than they do in the remainder of the hypertensives or in normal subjects. The responders of the hypertensive patients fail to increase renal blood flow or to enhance renal vascular responsiveness to infused AII when they shift from a low to a high sodium intake. The altered renal response of these \"sodium-sensitive\" hypertensives could be related to local activity of the RAS which is insufficiently suppressed by sodium loading. ACE-inhibition reverses this failure of the renal blood supply to respond to sodium loading. Kidneys of spontaneously hypertensive rats and the renin-rich kidney of Goldblatt-hypertensive rats show an increased tubulo glomerular (TG) feedback response as compared to normal kidneys. The change in TG-feedback response might be expected to contribute to the inability of the hypertensive kidney to respond adequately to sodium loading. ACE-inhibition reduces TG-feedback sensitivity. In renal artery stenosis glomerular capillary pressure tends to be maintained by an AII mediated rise in postglomerular resistance. Suppression of AII by ACE-inhibition reduces efferent vascular tone and thus filtration rate. There is a potential for interaction of ACE-inhibitors with the kallikrein and prostaglandin pathways as well as with the sympathetic nervous system and endogenous opioids. This may modify the renal and blood pressure responses to these compounds.", 
    "268": "The urinary excretion of captopril has been studied in a bladder-cannulated rat model and compared with that obtained after co-administration with probenecid. Probenecid reduced significantly the urinary excretion of captopril from 41% to 21% of the administered dose over a 3-hr period and significantly lowered urine flow rates. In addition, the effect of probenecid on plasma levels of captopril and total captopril (captopril plus disulfides) after oral administration of the disulfide prodrug captopril dimer (10 mg/kg) has been studied in a conscious rat preparation. Co-administration of probenecid (20 mg/kg) given either orally or intravenously increased both the plasma levels of captopril and total captopril (captopril plus captopril disulfides) over a 4-hr period. A prolonged significant inhibition of plasma ACE after co-administration of probenecid and captopril dimer suggests that probenecid may be useful to prolong the action of captopril or the prodrug captopril dimer.", 
    "269": "Twenty-four-hour Holter electrocardiographic recordings were used to measure the effects of a converting-enzyme inhibitor, enalapril, given for 12 weeks, on the frequency of cardiac arrhythmias in 10 patients with congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association functional class II to III) receiving maintenance therapy with digoxin and furosemide. Nine patients were given placebo, and both study groups were conducted in a double-blind, parallel manner. The placebo group had no change in the frequency of arrhythmias, whereas enalapril-treated patients showed a significant decrease in the frequency of premature ventricular complexes, ventricular couplets and ventricular tachycardia. A minor, nonsignificant reduction in atrial premature complexes was seen in patients who received enalapril. Compared with placebo patients, those who received enalapril had an increase in plasma potassium levels of 0.33 mmol/liter, a decrease in plasma digoxin, and decreases in pulmonary artery wedge, mean pulmonary artery and right atrial pressures. However, none of these indexes were correlated with the concomitant decline in cardiac arrhythmias. It is concluded that enalapril reduces the frequency of ventricular arrhythmias in congestive heart failure, although the underlying mechanisms are not known.", 
    "270": "The effects of opioids and of naloxone on ouabain-sensitive Na+,K+-adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity were studied in vitro on membrane fractions from frog spinal cords. The addition of morphine and of the stable enkephalin analogue, D-Ala2,D-Leu5-enkephalin, in concentrations from 10(-7) to 10(-4) M significantly increased Na+,K+-ATPase activity. No effect was found with methionine enkephalin (Met-Enk). However, the addition of two peptidase inhibitors, captopril and phosphoramidon (10(-5) M each), significantly increased Na+,K+-ATPase activity. A further increase in enzyme activity was found when Met-Enk (10(-4) or 10(-7) M) was added simultaneously with peptidase inhibitors. On the other hand, the addition of the opiate antagonist, naloxone, at low concentration (10(-7) M) decreased the activity of Na+,K+-ATPase. These results are discussed with respect to the effect of synthetic and endogenous opioids on the activity of Na+,K+-ATPase.", 
    "271": "Captopril in low doses has been used recently with success in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension. In the present study we compared the effects of captopril, 50 mg/day, to propranolol, 80 mg/day, as second-line antihypertensive agents. By administering each of these drugs together with hydrochlorothiazide, the mean blood pressure was lowered from 156/99 to 140/84 and from 15/98 to 140/85 mm Hg, respectively. Although serious adverse effects were infrequent in both groups of patients, bradycardia and fatigue were common among the subjects receiving propranolol, whereas captopril left the quality of life largely unaltered. Captopril appears to be a safe and effective antihypertensive agent in mild and moderate hypertension when used in low doses in addition to a thiazide diuretic.", 
    "272": "Two patients with hypertension due to coarctation of the aorta were treated for 12 weeks with captopril at increasing doses. After an immediate response, resistance developed to captopril, which was associated with restoration of initially elevated renin and plasma aldosterone levels. Lack of hypertension control may be related to long-term reappearance of mechanisms which lead to excessive renin stimulation.", 
    "273": "Groups of athymic nude (nu/nu) and littermate (nu/+) mice received transplants into skin of hepatic egg granulomas isolated from Schistosoma mansoni-infected nu/+ mice. Some were fed captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and other animals served as controls. Lesions were removed at 2, 4, and 6 weeks after implantation and prepared for light and electron microscopy. The number of new egg granulomas repopulated by recipient cells was compared by counting more than 100 eggs per specimen, randomly, double blind, and the effects of captopril on developing granulomas were determined. Results in nude mice indicated a trend for increasing granuloma takes with time in captopril-treated animals compared to controls, especially in mice who started therapy 2 weeks after transplantation. In nu/+ recipients the differences were more striking and statistically significant at 2 and 6 weeks after grafting. The granulomas in treated mice in both groups were larger than those in controls, but the cellular composition in the granulomas that developed were similar. New granulomas consisted mainly of eosinophils and mixed-function macrophages, although some purely secretory macrophages also were seen. The findings demonstrate that captopril ingestion enhanced granulomatous inflammation induced by skin transplantation of schistosome egg granulomas and significantly increased isograft takes. The results may have relevance for treating cutaneous diseases like sarcoidosis with captopril.", 
    "274": "Patients with idiopathic hyperaldosteronism (IHA) manifest hypertension, hypokalemia, and renin suppression. IHA is thought to have one of three possible etiologies: zona glomerulosa autonomy, an aldosterone secretory factor, or angiotensin-II (A-II) adrenal hypersensitivity. To determine the contribution of A-II adrenal hypersensitivity in IHA, four patients with IHA were treated with a new angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril, on a controlled diet (sodium [128 mEq/day] and potassium [80 mEq/day]) in a metabolic unit. The results of this study demonstrate that enalapril therapy in three of four patients normalized blood pressure, improved potassium balance, elevated PRA, reversed the postural increment in plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC), and reduced aldosterone secretion to normal. The fourth patient with bilateral macronodular disease, on the other hand, had no improvement in any of the above indices, despite maximal doses of enalapril (80 mg/day). This patient, however, may have had bilateral adrenal adenomas, based on extremely elevated 18-OH-corticosterone levels (greater than 100 ng/dl), and because of a lack of adrenal A-II hypersensitivity, demonstrated by a fall in pre-enalapril, postural-, and lasix-induced PAC. In conclusion, enalapril improved the hypertension, hypokalemia, renin suppression, and hyperaldosteronism in three patients with IHA over 28 days of therapy. The results of this study suggest an etiologic role of A-II adrenal hypersensitivity in IHA.", 
    "275": "The effects of MK 422 (enalaprilic acid) on renal function and electrolyte excretion were assessed in 14 patients with essential hypertension on a sodium intake of 100 mmol/day. Injection of MK 422 led to a prompt fall in blood pressure (p less than 0.01). Effective renal plasma flow increased by 9 +/- 4% (p less than 0.01) within 1 hour, an increase that persisted for a least 5 hours. Glomerular filtration rate did not change, so filtration fraction decreased by 6 +/- 2% (p less than 0.01). Sodium excretion increased with a maximum of 61 +/- 17% (p less than 0.01) after 5 hours, and potassium excretion fell (p less than 0.01). The log of the initial plasma renin activity correlated with the changes in blood pressure (r = 0.59, p less than 0.05) in effective renal plasma flow (r = 0.59, p less than 0.05) and in sodium excretion (r = 0.65, p less than 0.01). All the renal effects of MK 422 could be reversed by infusion with angiotensin II.", 
    "276": "After administration of captopril, a decrease in mean arterial blood pressure was observed in low sodium rats which were used as animal models of hyper-renin-active pathema. In normal rats, however, this marked decrease in blood pressure was not observed, even with high dose levels. In spite of the fact that captopril does not lower the blood pressure in normal rats, it was demonstrated that converting-enzyme activity was inhibited by captopril. No differences were observed between low sodium rats and normal rats in characteristics of angiotensin-converting enzyme. It was concluded that disposition of captopril might be different in the respective rats.", 
    "277": "The mechanism of bradykinin-potentiating activity of [des-Proline3]-bradykinin, a kinin originally generated from human plasma protein by trypsin, was studied in terms of its inhibitory actions on angiotensin-converting enzyme and kininase II prepared from rat lung. The results were compared with those obtained with Captopril. [Des-Pro3]-bradykinin was found to have a potent inhibitory action against angiotensin-converting enzyme with a K1 of 4.5 X 10(-12) M, which is approximately 7 times more potent than Captopril. It was also inhibitory to kininase II with a Ki of 4 X 10(-11) M, which is approximately 2,300-fold more potent than Captopril. The pattern of inhibition was purely competitive with increased apparent Km but no change in apparent Vmax for both angiotensin-converting enzyme and kininase II. This is in contrast to Captopril, which showed a mixed competitive and non-competitive type of inhibition with increased apparent Km and decreased Vmax for both enzymes. Such a potent inhibitory activity of [des-Pro3]-bradykinin or Arg-Pro-Gly-Phe-Ser-Pro-Phe-Arg is noteworthy, and accordingly we propose the name \"converstatin\" for this peptide.", 
    "278": "The disposition characteristics of pentopril (the ethyl ester) and its active carboxylic acid metabolite (CGS 13934) were determined in conscious rats after separate intravenous administrations of both compounds. The relationship between plasma concentration and pharmacological effect was also evaluated. The extent of apparent bioavailability of the active metabolite was determined after oral administration of pentopril. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated from the plasma concentration-time data for both the parent drug and its active metabolite after their separate intravenous administrations using a one-compartment model for the drug and a two-compartment model for the metabolite. The elimination half-life for the drug was approximately 1 min. The elimination half-life for the metabolite was 13 min (SD, +/- 3.5, n = 4) after its direct intravenous administration, but increased to an apparent half-life of 20 min (SD +/- 5, n = 5) when formed in vivo as a metabolite. Comparison of the formation rate of the metabolite and the elimination rate of the parent drug indicated that the parent drug was rapidly and completely hydrolyzed to the acid metabolite as soon as it reached the systemic circulation. No parent drug was detected in plasma after its oral administration. The apparent bioavailability of the acid metabolite was 66% after oral drug administration. A close relation between inhibition of pressor response to angiotensin I (AI) and plasma concentration of the active metabolite was observed when plotted against time after drug or metabolite administration. A Michaelis-Menten function correlated (multiple r2:0.995) well between effect and plasma metabolite concentration with mean concentration for 50% of maximum inhibition, IC50, of 3.6 X 10(-7) M (0.11 microgram/mL).", 
    "279": "Pentopril (CGS 13945) was administered in 125-mg capsules to eight healthy men on two occasions according to a randomized schedule; on one occasion in the fasting state and on the other occasion immediately following the ingestion of a standardized meal. Unlike captopril, a prototype angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, there was no significant difference in the peak plasma concentration for either the drug or its active metabolite (CGS 13934) between the fasting and the fed states. There was also no appreciable change in the area under the plasma curve for the drug and its metabolite after administration of drug in the presence of food compared with a fasting state. There was, however, a lag time in drug absorption after ingestion of food, which resulted in a significant increase in peak time for the active metabolite in plasma. Food delays the body's absorption of the drug and hence the appearance of its active metabolite in plasma without any significant effect on the relative bioavailability. Because relative bioavailability is not affected in the presence of food, such a delay may not have any therapeutic importance on chronic administration.", 
    "280": "The angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are an important therapeutic advance in the treatment of patients with hypertension and congestive heart failure. In addition, they are useful pharmacological probes to assess the contribution of the renin-angiotensin system to circulatory homeostasis. Captopril was the first angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor approved for use in patients with hypertension and congestive heart failure. It is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, with detectable plasma concentrations apparent as early as 15 minutes. The extent of absorption is between 60 and 75% of an oral dose and peak plasma concentrations occur after approximately one hour. Captopril is primarily excreted by the kidneys via renal tubular secretion. Renal excretion is rapid, with 90% completed in the first 4 hours. The elimination half-life for unchanged captopril is about 1.7 hours and is markedly increased in the presence of renal insufficiency. Once absorbed, captopril is extensively metabolised to several forms, including a disulphide dimer of captopril, a captopril-cysteine disulphide, and other mixed disulphides with endogenous thiol compounds. It is probable that captopril and its pool of metabolites undergo reversible interconversions. Pharmacokinetic properties of captopril in patients with uncomplicated hypertension appear to be the same as in healthy subjects. However, long term administration of captopril leads to increased concentrations of total captopril, probably from the accumulation of captopril metabolites. Despite the number of potential influences on pharmacokinetic properties in patients with congestive heart failure, due to the many abnormalities in gastrointestinal tract oedema and reductions in splanchnic and renal blood flow, the available data suggest that its pharmacokinetic properties in patients with congestive heart failure resemble those in healthy subjects. However, additional data are necessary to confirm this. Enalapril is the second angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor to become available. Enalapril is a prodrug that is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, with 60 to 70% of an oral dose being absorbed. However, enalapril must be converted by hepatic esterases to the active form, enalaprilat. After the oral administration of enalapril, the tmax for enalapril is one hour, but for enalaprilat it is 4 hours. There is a prolonged terminal elimination phase with enalaprilat being detectable as late as 96 hours after dosing. Thus, enalapril has a much longer duration of action than captopril. Like captopril, enalapril is primarily excreted by the kidneys.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "281": "The effects of enalapril, 20 mg orally, on the responses to baroreflex activation and deactivation by respectively phenylephrine and nitroglycerin were investigated in normotensive subjects on a normal sodium diet, with simultaneous measurement of plasma renin activity (PRA), converting enzyme activity (PCEA), aldosterone and catecholamines. Enalapril, 4 h after administration, lowered artificial blood pressure without modifying heart rate and plasma catecholamines. PCEA was abolished, PRA increased and plasma aldosterone decreased. Enalapril (a) displaced to the left the baroreflex set-point, (b) did not affect baroreflex sensitivity since the slopes of the RR-interval/systolic blood pressure regression lines remained unchanged during both activation and deactivation and (c) did not modify baroreflex efficacy since the maximal RR-interval responses as well as the overall RR-interval-time products to identical blood pressure variations were not modified. Thus, enalapril induced a resetting of the baroreflex, which probably accounts for the lack of reflex tachycardia observed during the drug-induced fall in blood pressure.", 
    "282": "Several studies have shown symptomatic and haemodynamic improvement after the introduction of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with heart failure treated with diuretics. The concomitant long term effects of the new orally effective long acting angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril, on symptoms, exercise performance, cardiac function, arrhythmias, hormones, electrolytes, body composition, and renal function have been further assessed in a placebo controlled double blind cross over trial with treatment periods of eight weeks. Twenty patients with New York Heart Association functional class II to IV heart failure who were clinically stable on digoxin and diuretic therapy were studied. Apart from the introduction of enalapril, regular treatment was not changed over the study period; no order or period effects were noted. Enalapril treatment significantly improved functional class, symptom score for breathlessness, and exercise tolerance. Systolic blood pressure was significantly lower on enalapril treatment. Echocardiographic assessment indicated a reduction in left ventricular dimensions and an improvement in systolic time intervals. In response to enalapril, the plasma concentration of angiotensin II was reduced and that of active renin rose; plasma concentrations of aldosterone, vasopressin, and noradrenaline fell. There were significant increases in serum potassium and serum magnesium on enalapril. Glomerular filtration rate measured both by isotopic techniques and by creatinine clearance declined on enalapril while serum urea and creatinine rose and effective renal plasma flow increased. Body weight and total body sodium were unchanged indicating that there was no overall diuresis. There was a statistically insignificant rise in total body potassium, though the increase was related directly to pretreatment plasma renin (r = 0.5). On enalapril the improvement in symptoms, exercise performance, fall in plasma noradrenaline, and rise in serum potassium coincided with a decline in the frequency of ventricular extrasystoles recorded during ambulatory monitoring. Adverse effects were few. In patients with heart failure, enalapril had a beneficial effect on symptoms and functional capacity. The decline in glomerular filtration rate on enalapril may not be beneficial in early heart failure.", 
    "283": "The relation between plasma renin activity before treatment and the haemodynamic and clinical responses to converting enzyme inhibition was determined in 100 consecutive patients with severe chronic heart failure who were treated with captopril or enalapril. Initial doses of captopril produced significant increases in cardiac index and decreases in left ventricular filling pressure, mean arterial pressure, mean right atrial pressure, heart rate, and systemic vascular resistance that varied linearly with the pretreatment value for plasma renin activity. In contrast, there was no relation between the pretreatment activity and the magnitude of haemodynamic improvement after 1-3 months of treatment with the converting enzyme inhibitors, and, consequently, a similar proportion of patients with a high (greater than 6 ng/ml/h; greater than 4.62 mmol/l/h), intermediate (2-6 ng/ml/h; 1.54-4.62 mmol/l/h), and low (less than 2 ng/ml/h; less than 1.54 mmol/l/h) pretreatment value improved clinically during long term treatment (64%, 60%, and 64% respectively). Long term survival after one, two, and three years was similar in the three groups. Estimating the degree of activation of the renin-angiotensin system by measuring pretreatment plasma renin activity fails to predict the long term haemodynamic or clinical responses to converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with severe chronic heart failure, and thus appears to be of limited value in selecting those patients likely to benefit from treatment with these drugs.", 
    "284": "A series of non-sulfhydryl modified dipeptides related to CI-906, CI-907, and enalapril was prepared in which various isosteric moieties (O, S, SO, SO2) have been substituted for the amino group and in which the proline residue has been replaced with various hydrophobic amino acids. The compounds were evaluated in vitro for inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme and in vivo for antihypertensive activity. Compound 7c, the most potent member of this series, had an in vitro IC50 of 1.4 X 10(-8) M and showed modest oral antihypertensive activity at 30 mg/kg in conscious, two kidney, one clip Goldblatt hypertensive rats. Structure-activity relationships are discussed.", 
    "285": "The effectiveness of phosphonamidate peptide analogues as inhibitors of rat kidney or human brain metalloendopeptidase (enkephalinase, E.C. 3.4.24.11) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, 3.4.14.1) has been explored with a series of enkephalin analogues in which the scissile Gly3-Phe4 amide bond has been replaced with a phosphonamidate moiety. These compounds exhibited good inhibitory potency against enkephalinase with several of the analogues having Ki values in the submicromolar range as contrasted to micromolar or higher toward ACE. Within a series of [(N-acylamino)methyl] phosphonamidates there was a dramatic decrease in inhibitory activity against enkephalinase as the N-acyl moiety was substituted with larger, more hydrophobic acyl groups. Likewise, the inhibitory activity of the [(N-acylamino)methyl] phosphonamidates against ACE was attenuated by larger phenylalkyl acyl functionalities, although not to the same degree as against enkephalinase. However, phosphonamidate pentapeptide analogues of (Leu)enkephalin and (D-Ala2,D-Leu5)enkephalin showed good inhibitory potency against both enzymes. Interestingly, these two (Leu)enkephalin phosphonamidate analogues were completely inactive in the electrically stimulated guinea pig ileum and mouse vas deferens preparations. Conformational factors that may be involved in this inactivity are discussed.", 
    "286": "Exercise capacity in patients with left heart failure is closely related to the performance of the right ventricle and the pulmonary circulation. To determine the significance of changes in pulmonary resistance during long-term vasodilator therapy, hemodynamic studies were performed before and after 1 to 3 months of treatment with captopril in 75 patients with severe chronic left heart failure. Patients were grouped according to the relative changes in pulmonary and systemic resistances during long-term therapy: patients in Group I (n = 24) showed greater decreases in pulmonary arteriolar resistance (PAR) than in systemic vascular resistance (SVR) (% delta PAR/% delta SVR greater than 1.0), whereas patients in Group II showed predominant systemic vasodilation (% delta PAR/% delta SVR less than 1.0). Despite similar changes in systemic resistance, patients in Group I showed greater increases in cardiac index, stroke volume index and left ventricular stroke work index (p less than 0.01 to 0.001) but less dramatic decreases in mean systemic arterial pressure (p less than 0.02) than did patients in Group II. Despite similar changes in left ventricular filling pressure, patients in Group I showed greater decreases in mean pulmonary artery and mean right atrial pressures (p less than 0.02 to 0.01) than did patients in Group II. Pretreatment variables in Groups I and II were similar, except that plasma renin activity was higher (8.7 +/- 2.1 versus 3.0 +/- 0.6 ng/ml per h) and serum sodium concentration was lower (133.1 +/- 0.9 versus 137.1 +/- 0.6 mEq/liter) in Group II than in Group I (both p less than 0.05). Both groups improved clinically after 1 to 3 months, but symptomatic hypotension occurred more frequently in Group II than in Group I (36 versus 8%) (p less than 0.005). These findings indicate that changes in the pulmonary circulation modulate alterations in both right and left ventricular performance during the treatment of patients with left heart failure. Hyponatremic patients are likely to experience symptomatic hypotension with captopril because they are limited in their ability to increase cardiac output as a result of an inadequate pulmonary vasodilator response to the drug.", 
    "287": "The maximal aerobic exercise capacity of patients with chronic heart failure is frequently decreased because of inadequate blood flow to working skeletal muscle. To investigate whether this reduced flow is in part due to interference by angiotensin II with arteriolar dilation in working muscle, the effect of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril on leg blood flow, leg vascular resistance, leg oxygen consumption (VO2) and leg lactate release during maximal upright bicycle exercise was examined in 12 patients with heart failure (maximal VO2 10.7 +/- 3.1 ml/min per kg). Captopril decreased leg resistance at rest (258 +/- 115 to 173 +/- 67 U, p less than 0.01) and maximal exercise (68 +/- 69 to 45 +/- 29 U, p less than 0.01) associated with proportionately similar decreases in systemic vascular resistance. However, maximal exercise duration and maximal VO2 were unchanged and, at identical peak exercise work times, there was no improvement in leg blood flow (2.0 +/- 0.9 to 2.0 +/- 1.1 liters/min, p = NS), leg VO2 (261 +/- 104 to 281 +/- 157 ml/min, p = NS) or leg lactate release (269 +/- 149 to 227 +/- 151 mg/min, p = NS). These data suggest that, during exercise in patients with heart failure, angiotensin II does not interfere with blood flow to working skeletal muscle.", 
    "288": "We used a model of cirrhosis in the rat, produced by inhalation of carbon tetrachloride for 6 weeks, to investigate the mechanism of resistance to the pressor effects of angiotensin II. The pressor response to angiotensin II was significantly lower in conscious cirrhotic animals than in controls. On the other hand, cirrhotic animals had normal pressor responses to norepinephrine, indicating that a generalized defect in vascular reactivity does not cause the decreased pressor response to angiotensin II. Enhanced baroreceptor activity was not the cause of the decreased pressor response to angiotensin II, since baroreflex control of heart rate after angiotensin II was similar in cirrhotics and controls. Pretreatment with either the converting enzyme inhibitor captopril to reduce circulating angiotensin II or the prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor meclofenamate failed to normalize the response to angiotensin II. Thus, neither prior occupancy of receptors with endogenous angiotensin II nor the production of vasodilatory prostaglandins was responsible for the decreased angiotensin II response. Studies of angiotensin II binding by mesenteric artery smooth muscle particles showed that, in cirrhotic animals, receptor affinity for angiotensin II, was significantly lower than in controls (kd: cirrhosis 1.11 +/- 0.09 nM, control 0.94 +/- 0.13 nM; P less than 0.02), whereas receptor number was significantly increased (cirrhosis 315 +/- 42 fmol/mg protein, control 277 +/- 43 fmol/mg protein, P less than 0.01). However, total binding of AII by vascular receptors from cirrhotics was no different than in controls, since the decrease in affinity negated the increase in receptor number.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "289": "Angiotensins are produced by granuloma macrophages in murine Schistosoma mansoni. During the course of infection, granuloma undergo a T-cell-dependent process called modulation in which their maximal size decreases. This study was undertaken to establish whether angiotensin production by granuloma macrophages is altered by immunoregulatory lymphocytes. Granuloma macrophages from modulated lesions released and contained more angiotensin II/III (AII/III) and less angiotensin I (AI) than those from the acute infection. Captopril, a specific angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, appreciably decreased AII/III produced by macrophages from modulated granulomas. Adoptive transfer of splenic T lymphocytes from chronically infected donors into acutely infected recipients altered angiotensin production by the granuloma macrophages in a manner similar to that seen in modulated lesions. However, no difference was detected in the capacity of granuloma macrophages from acutely or chronically infected mice to metabolize 125I-AI or -AII added to cell cultures. Similarly, captopril did not alter the metabolism of exogenously administrated angiotensins. These findings suggest that regulatory T lymphocytes influence the metabolism by granuloma macrophages of endogenously produced angiotensins at least in part by induction of macrophage ACE activity. However, the degradation of extracellular AI and AII may result from the activity of enzymes other than ACE which are not inducible by modulation.", 
    "290": "In normal man, converting enzyme inhibition (CEI) acutely increases plasma active renin and decreases plasma inactive renin. This reciprocal relationship suggests that conversion of inactive to active renin may be important in the acute response to stimulation of renin secretion. To determine whether the beta-adrenergic system or prostaglandins (PGs) participate in the acute effect of CEI on renin, we administered captopril (50 mg) alone and with either propranolol (P; 80 mg) or a PG cyclooxygenase inhibitor [PI; indomethacin (50 mg) or ibuprofen (800 mg)] to normal subjects ingesting a 25 meq/day Na diet. Supine blood pressure fell by 12 +/- 2 (+/- SE) mm Hg with CEI alone, 10 +/- 1 mm Hg with CEI plus P, and 7 +/- 1 mm Hg with CEI plus PI. Active renin rose 8-fold (P less than 0.01), with a peak at 1-2 h, after CEI and 3-fold (P less than 0.02) in response to CEI plus P or CEI plus PI. P did not block the fall in acid-activated inactive renin compared to CEI alone. The nadir of the inactive renin response to both CEI or CEI plus P occurred at 1-2 h. PI, however, prevented the fall in inactive renin. To extend this observation, we compared the effects of infusion of a vasodilator PG (PGA1; 0.6 micrograms/kg X min) and a pure beta-agonist (isoproterenol; 0.3 micrograms/kg X min). PGA1 increased active renin 2.5-fold and decreased inactive renin by 80% (both P less than 0.02), while isoproterenol increased active renin 4.1-fold, but did not significantly change inactive renin. These data suggest that the beta-adrenergic system and PGs at least acutely stimulate renin production at different steps of its biosynthesis or secretion.", 
    "291": "Chronic somatostatin (SRIF) administration induced atrophy of zona glomerulosa cells of the rat adrenal cortex and a noticeable fall in the plasma concentration of aldosterone. The effects of SRIF were comparable with those of captopril, a specific inhibitor of the angiotensin-converting enzyme. SRIF completely abrogated the adrenoglomerulotrophic effects of angiotensin II (AII); the inhibitory actions of SRIF and captopril were not additive. The slight but significant enhancement of zona fasciculata cell growth and plasma corticosterone levels caused by chronic AII administration were ot reversed by SRIF. We interpret these data to indicate that SRIF specifically modulates the stimulatory effects of AII on the growth and steroidogenic capacity of rat zona glomerulosa.", 
    "292": "Recent clinical trials in hypertension report more deaths due to coronary heart disease in mild hypertensives who received aggressive antihypertensive drug therapy and achieved better blood pressure control. Subset analyses of these trials suggest that diuretic therapy may have contributed to this outcome, possibly through a reduction in serum potassium or an elevation in serum lipids. Because of this, patients with an abnormal pretreatment electrocardiogram, history of myocardial infarction, unstable coronary heart disease, or diuretic-induced hyperlipidemia or hypokalemia unresponsive to management are candidates for alternative antihypertensive agents. A review of the literature suggests that most of the currently available beta-blockers, the alpha 1-antagonist prazosin, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril, and the vasodilator hydralazine are effective alternatives to thiazide therapy in the initial management of hypertension and are recommended for particular subgroups of patients. Monotherapy with the centrally and peripherally acting sympatholytic agents is not recommended because of the frequent side effects encountered and the inferior hypotensive efficacy reported. Calcium channel blocking agents also appear to be suitable alternatives to thiazides in hypertension, but more experience with these is needed. Alternative pharmacologic agents may be selected on the basis of age, and, to a lesser extent, race.", 
    "293": "The hypotensive action of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors enalapril and S-9490-3 was examined in conscious, chronically cannulated Na+-replete and Na+-deplete spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) of the Okamoto strain. Blood pressure, plasma ACE activity, plasma renin activity (PRA), and pressor responses to intravenous bolus injections of angiotensin I (AI) were measured over a 24-h period following a single oral dose of ACE inhibitor (0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 mg/kg) or vehicle. S-9490-3 caused a significantly greater hypotensive response and inhibition of plasma ACE and AI pressor responses than enalapril for each dose in both diet groups. Single oral doses of both drugs (3 mg/kg) caused slow, progressive falls in blood pressure which were maximal at 12 h. In contrast, inhibition of plasma ACE was maximal 1 h following the oral dose and returned to control levels over the 24-h period. The inhibition of the pressor response to intravenous AI paralleled, and was significantly correlated with, the inhibition of plasma ACE. There was no correlation between the maximal fall in blood pressure with PRA or with inhibition of plasma ACE activity in either diet group. The hypotensive response to both drugs at the 3-mg/kg dose was greater in Na+-deplete SHR than in Na+-replete animals. Both drugs caused large rises in PRA. The ACE inhibitor S-9490-3 is a significantly more potent hypotensive agent than enalapril in the SHR and a significantly more potent ACE inhibitor in vivo. The hypotensive response to both drugs was dissociated in onset and duration from the inhibition of plasma ACE and AI pressor responses.", 
    "294": "The impact of oral captopril, 2 mg . kg-1, on the dose and on the hemodynamic and hormonal effects of nitroprusside was studied in seven patients (Group II). A comparable group (Group I, n = 7) received nitroprusside alone. In both groups, nitroprusside produced comparable decreases in mean arterial pressure, systemic vascular resistance, and right atrial pressure; cardiac output increased because of a significant change in heart rate. Although plasma renin activity increased significantly (compared with control values) in both groups, it was greater (p = 0.01) through the operative period in patients pretreated with captopril. Plasma aldosterone concentration increased in Group I (p = 0.01) but decreased in Group II (p = 0.01). Plasma catecholamine concentrations increased (p = 0.01) with nitroprusside alone but were unchanged in captopril-treated patients. Plasma converting enzyme activity was markedly inhibited (p = 0.001) by captopril. Following cessation of nitroprusside infusion in Group I, rebound hypertension occurred in conjunction with a significant (p = 0.01) increase in systemic vascular resistance; it was associated with elevated plasma renin activity, catecholamines, and aldosterone concentrations. In contrast, captopril-treated patients showed no rebound hemodynamic changes. Nitroprusside dose was less (p = 0.01) with captopril pretreatment (2.1 +/- 0.3 vs. 4.8 +/- 0.9 microgram . kg-1 . min-1). Thus, captopril is a useful adjunct to nitroprusside-induced hypotension.", 
    "295": "The forearm arterial effects of enalapril and propranolol were compared by means of pulsed Doppler velocimetry in 28 patients with hypertension after treatment for 3-6 months. Enalapril decreased blood pressure, increased both brachial artery diameter and blood flow, decreased vascular resistance, and increased the arterial compliance of the forearm. Propranolol also decreased blood pressure but did not produce any other changes. It may be concluded that the treatment of hypertension with enalapril, but not propranolol, is associated with dilatation effects on the arterial circulation of the forearm.", 
    "296": "The synthesis and binding properties to rat brain tissue of the enkephalinase inhibitor [3H] N-[(R,S)-3-hydroxyaminocarbonyl-2-benzyl-1-oxopropyl]-glycine ([3H]HACBO-Gly, 45 Ci/mmole) is reported. [3H]HACBO-Gly binding to membranes from various rat brain tissue is saturable (KD = 0.4 +/- 0.05 nM) and linearly related to the amount of tissue. Non specific binding is less than 15% of total binding at the KD concentration. The regional distribution of [3H]HACBO-Gly binding and enkephalinase activity are closely correlated with highest levels in striatum and substantia nigra. The efficiency of inhibitors of various peptidases (thiorphan, captopril, bestatin ...) to inhibit [3H]HACBO-Gly binding or enkephalinase activity are similar. These results indicate that [3H]HACBO-Gly binds selectively to enkephalinase. This compound should help to clarify the localization of the enzyme in the CNS.", 
    "297": "We have purified angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, EC 3.4.15.1) from rat brain corpus striatum and rat lung. The brain enzyme has Mr 165,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis, whereas the lung enzyme is 175,000. This difference is not an artifact of preparation since mixture of the two tissues prior to purification results in isolation of two proteins with Mr 165,000 and 175,000. Separation of tryptic fragments of 125I-labeled lung and brain ACE by reverse-phase chromatography yields distinct but similar patterns. No differences between the native enzymes are detected in dansyl-tripeptide cleavage specificity, inhibitor profile, immunological properties, sucrose gradient sedimentation, or gel filtration of ACE from the two tissues. However, lung and brain ACE can be differentiated in their ability to cleave amidated peptides. Both lung and brain ACE cleave Arg-Pro-Lys-Pro-Gln-Gln-Phe-Phe-Gly-Leu-Met-NH2 (substance P) via two pathways. In one pathway, ACE first releases Gly-Leu-Met-NH2 and then dipeptides sequentially from the carboxyl terminus. The other first produces Leu-Met-NH2, and then releases dipeptides to leave substance P 1-5. Lung ACE favors initial tripeptide release 3:1, while the striatal enzyme acts via the two pathways to a similar extent. Lung and striatal ACE also differ in their ability to degrade other amidated peptides. His-Lys-Thr-Asp-Ser-Phe-Val-Gly-Leu-Met-NH2 (substance K) and bombesin are degraded by striatal but not lung ACE. Physalaemin and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone are cleaved by both enzymes, while eledoisin, kassinin, thyrotropin-releasing hormone, and substance P 5-11 are not cleaved by either enzyme. Physalaemin is degraded more rapidly by the lung enzyme. The coincidence of an ACE isozyme with substance P and substance K in the descending striatonigral pathway and the unique ability of this isozyme to cleave substance P and substance K suggest that one or both of these peptides is a physiological substrate for striatonigral ACE.", 
    "298": "Degradation of dermorphin, [D-Arg2]dermorphin and [D-Arg2, Gly3, Phe4]dermorphin in a soluble rat brain extract was examined. The former two heptapeptides were degraded in a similar fashion to produce corresponding N-terminal tetrapeptide as the main degradation product along with the parallel release of Tyr5, Pro6 and Ser7-NH2. Tyr-D-Arg-Phe-Gly showed a good enzymatic stability. When captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, was present in the incubation mixture, hydrolysis of the Gly4-Tyr5 bond was markedly suppressed and resulted in release of the corresponding N-terminal hexapeptide as the main degradation product. Combined use of captopril and amastatin, an aminopeptidase inhibitor, markedly suppressed the hydrolysis of these peptides. On the other hand, [D-Arg2, Gly3, Phe4]dermorphin was hydrolyzed easier than the other two heptapeptides and considerable amounts of Tyr1 and Phe4 were released after 20 hr incubation while the N-terminal tetrapeptide, Tyr-D-Arg-Gly-Phe, showed a good enzymatic stability. On the basis of these results, possible degradation pathways of these heptapeptides were discussed.",

Kinetic data show that the inhibition is competitive, with a Ki of 3.5 microM. WY-45,368 inhibits neither of two other metalloproteinases, thermolysin and angiotensin converting enzyme, nor does it inhibit clostridial collagenase--thus indicating specificity for mammalian collagenase.", 
    "300": "In a previous paper we demonstrated that the heptapeptide [Met]enkephalyl-Arg6-Phe7 was released from rat striatal slices by high K+ concentration and rapidly degraded by peptidases, even in the presence of the neutral endopeptidase 24.11 (\"enkephalinase\")-inhibitor, thiorphan (0.1 microM), the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril (1 microM), and the aminopeptidase inhibitor, bestatin (20 microM). In this study the pattern of degradation of exogenous [3H]heptapeptide by rat striatal slices has been studied. The angiotensin-converting enzyme and aminopeptidase(s) were partly responsible for this degradation. In addition an enzymatic activity that cleaved the Phe4-Met5 bond was involved in the degradation of the heptapeptide by striatal slices. This activity was inhibited by the dipeptide Leu-Arg (1 mM) and the tripeptide Leu-Arg-Leu (1 mM). The simultaneous presence of thiorphan (0.1 microM), captopril (1 microM), bestatin (20 microM) and Leu-Arg (1 mM) almost completely inhibited the degradation of [3H]heptapeptide by striatal slices. In the presence of these peptidase inhibitors a concomitant release of [Met]enkephalin, the heptapeptide [Met]enkephalyl-Arg6-Phe7 and the octapeptide [Met]enkephalyl-Arg6-Gly7-Leu8 was evoked by KCl or veratridine. The K+-evoked release was by a Ca2+-dependent mechanism and the release evoked by veratridine was blocked by tetrodotoxin. In both cases the ratio of [Met]enkephalin to heptapeptide amounts released was close to that found in their common precursor, proenkephalin. Thus the enkephalinergic neuron appears to be capable of synthesizing, from a unique precursor, four different putative opioid neurotransmitters, namely [Met]enkephalin, [Leu]enkephalin, the heptapeptide [Met]enkephalyl-Arg6-Phe7 and the octapeptide [Met]enkephalyl-Arg6-Gly7-Leu8, to store these peptides and to release them upon depolarization.",

[Prolyl-U-14C]alacepril was synthesized in over-all yield of 32.7-38.0% by the mixed anhydride condensation of L-phenylalanine with [prolyl-U-14C]DU-1163, which had been prepared from L-[U-14C]proline and N-(S-3-acetylthio-2-methylpropanoyloxy)succinimide. [Prolyl-U-14C]captopril and [prolyl-U-14C]DU-1227 were prepared in high yields by hydrolysis of [prolyl-U-14C]DU-1163 and [prolyl-U-14C]alacepril, respectively.

Serum and total body electrolytes were measured and the response to 6 week periods of treatment with captopril determined. During the placebo phase of the study, total body potassium was low at 92 +/- 14% of predicted normal (P less than 0.05) and total body sodium was high at 104 + 7% of predicted normal (P less than 0.05). Total body chlorine did not differ from predicted normal (99 + 12%). In those patients with active plasma renin concentrations above the normal range (greater than 50 microU ml-1) total body potassium was even more markedly deplete (85 + 13% of predicted normal). This group was also characterized by lower serum potassium and sodium concentrations and lower blood pressure. Total body potassium increased significantly on captopril, and the rise was greatest in those with the highest plasma renin concentrations during the placebo phase of the study. However, captopril had no significant effect on total body sodium and chlorine or weight indicating that no long-term natriuresis had occurred.", 
    "303": "The role of the renin-angiotensin system in the autoregulation and distribution of the single nephron glomerular filtration rate (SNGFR) in anaesthetized, normotensive rats was investigated. SNGFR in outer cortical (OC) and inner cortical (IC) nephrons of the left kidney were measured with a modified Hanssen technique at three levels of renal arterial pressure (RAP): at a spontaneous arterial pressure; at a value within the autoregulatory limit, 100 mmHg; and at the lower limit of the autoregulatory range, 70 mmHg. This was done in control rats and in rats given a continuous i.v. infusion of the converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI) captopril (3 mg . h-1 X kg-1 BW). In control rats there was complete autoregulation of SNGFR in both OC and IC nephrons when RAP was reduced to 100 mmHg. Further reduction to 70 mmHg elicited different responses among the cortical layers, associated with a decrease in SNGFR. A fractional redistribution of glomerular filtration rate towards IC nephrons was evident. Administration of CEI at spontaneous RAP increased SNGFR in IC nephrons compared with values in control rats, but did not notably alter SNGFR in OC nephrons. Reduction of RAP to 100 mmHg during CEI infusion caused SNGFR to decrease below control values in both OC and IC nephrons, and the autoregulation as found in control rats was impaired. When RAP was lowered to 70 mmHg during CEI administration there was a progressive decrease in SNGFR in all cortical layers, although absolute changes were much greater in IC nephrons than in OC nephrons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "304": "The effects of furosemide and captopril were studied in nephrectomized rats with and without submaxillary gland. Captopril increased blood flow, but did not modified blood pressure. Furosemide plus captopril decreased significantly blood pressure. These results suggest a release of kallikrein by furosemide and probably a formation of kinin from plasma kininogen. On the other hand, rats sialodectomized showed no alterations in blood pressure in response to both drugs. These data suggest that submaxillary gland kallikrein participates in the mechanism of blood pressure regulation and blood flow of the gland at least in our experimental conditions. Glandular kallikreins are serine proteases which release kinins from substrates called kininogen. They are found in extracts and secretions of all exocrine glands. This proteases have been implicated in the regulation of exocrine glands and kidney blood flow, in water and electrolyte balance, in blood pressure regulation and in the pathogenesis of experimental and clinical hypertension (Carretero et al., 1978; Martinez Seeber et al., 1982). Glandular kallikreins of exocrine glands and kidney are secreted into the exocrine secretions and urine and also into the vascular compartment, where a local blood flow could be affected. According to Gautvik et al. (1980), rat submandibular gland is an organ rich in kallikrein, and significants amounts of the gland enzyme are release into the circulation after stimulation (Orstavik et al., 1982). Hilton and Lewis (1956) first proposed that glandular kallikrein-kinin system in salivary glands regulates vasodilation, probably through the effect of kallikrein on plasma kininogen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "305": "Arterial blood pressures and heart rates were measured in water-replete and in water-deprived (48 h) conscious, adult rats that had received capsaicin (50 mg kg-1) or its vehicle neonatally. Resting arterial blood pressures and heart rates in capsaicin-treated rats were not different from the controls in either the water-replete or the water-deprived state. Inhibition of the vascular actions of vasopressin (with 1-beta-mercapto,-beta, beta-cyclopentamethylenepropionic acid, 8-D-arginine vasopressin, (d(CH2)5DAVP] had no significant effect on blood pressures in the water-replete animals but caused a significant hypotension in water-deprived rats; the magnitude of the hypotension was the same irrespective of whether the animals had received capsaicin or its vehicle. During angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition (with captopril) and ganglion blockade (with pentolinium), the vasopressin-mediated blood pressure recovery was more gradual in the capsaicin-treated animals than in the controls, but after 60 min blood pressures were similar in all groups. Collectively the results indicate that although the full development of vasopressin-dependent mechanisms following acute hypotension takes longer when a large proportion of unmyelinated afferent fibres have been destroyed by neonatal treatment with capsaicin, 48 h of water deprivation results in a normal involvement of vasopressin-dependent mechanisms in the maintenance of blood pressure.", 
    "306": "We investigated the effect of captopril, an orally active angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, on urinary protein excretion in puromycin aminonucleoside nephrotic rats. The administration of captopril (10 mg/100 g body weight) decreased proteinuria on days 10-14 following the administration of puromycin aminonucleoside (73.0 versus 125.0 mg, p less than 0.01), without affecting glomerular filtration rate. The beneficial effect of captopril was not abolished by the continuous intravenous infusion of angiotensin II (10 micrograms/kg/h for 9 days) or subcutaneous injections of aprotinin (50,000 KIU/day for 3 days). Indomethacin, in moderate (5 mg/kg/day for 3 days) or high (10 mg/kg/day) doses, abolished the captopril attenuation in urinary protein excretion. The salutory effect of captopril was characterized by a reduction in the fractional excretion of protein without compromising the glomerular filtration rate. No difference in renal ultrastructure was noted in captopril-treated versus control animals. Captopril was ineffective in reducing urinary protein excretion in rats with adriamycin-induced glomerulopathy. We conclude that captopril acts to reduce proteinuria in renal disease states arising from depletion of the glomerular basement membrane polyanion. The mechanism of action is postulated to be an alteration in renal hemodynamics, namely increased blood flow and a decrease in the ultrafiltration coefficient, that are the consequence of increased intrarenal prostaglandin production.", 
    "307": "The yields of aldosterone obtained during incubation of whole adrenal capsule tissue from the rat (consisting of the connective tissue capsule itself, all of the glomerulosa tissue, and some fasciculata) cannot apparently be accounted for by the gland's capacity for de novo synthesis of this steroid. Recent studies with proteolytic enzymes and inhibitors suggest that in part aldosterone output may result from the activation of proteolytic events which release aldosterone from a sequestered intraglandular pool. These proteolytic events are mimicked by the addition of trypsin to whole tissue incubations in vitro. Experiments were carried out to determine what factors may govern the size of such intraglandular steroid pools. The most remarkable effect was that prior sodium depletion greatly enhanced the yield (2-3-fold) of aldosterone on subsequent incubation of adrenal capsules with trypsin, to an extent far greater than the increase in basal (non trypsin induced) aldosterone output in this tissue. Although betamethasone (20 micrograms/ml in drinking water) and the converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (7.2 mg/day) eliminated trypsin releasable steroid in control animals, they had no effect on the enhanced levels of trypsin releasable steroid seen with sodium depletion. The data suggest that trypsin releasable steroid pools are variable in accordance with the physiological requirements of the animal, particularly in sodium depletion.", 
    "308": "Captopril caused a renin-dependent increase in water intake in rats with bilateral ureteric ligation. But despite the fluid retention and fall in osmolality caused by the increased water intake, rats with ureteric ligation did not drink the 2.7% NaCl also offered to them. In rats with a pre-existing increase in sodium appetite caused by adrenalectomy, low dosage of captopril augmented intake of both water and 2.7% NaCl whereas high dosage inhibited intake of both fluids after an initial increase in water intake. In contrast, rats with a pre-existing increase in sodium appetite caused by daily injections of deoxycorticosterone showed no changes in intake of water or 2.7% NaCl after either low or high dosage of captopril, though they drank both fluids after intracranial injection of angiotensin II. Increases in water and 2.7% NaCl intake caused by low dosage of captopril in adrenalectomized rats were not secondary to increased urinary fluid and electrolyte losses. Decreases in intake after high dosage were not explained by the rats being too weak to drink. Low and high dosage of captopril caused increases in plasma renin concentration in adrenalectomized rats, but in contrast renin remained undetectable in the plasma of deoxycorticosterone-treated rats after the highest dosage of captopril. Whether or not captopril affected a pre-existing sodium appetite depended on whether or not it increased plasma renin. Since it affected the pre-existing sodium appetite and plasma renin in the adrenalectomized rat but neither of these in the deoxycorticosterone-treated rat, it is likely that the appetite was renin-dependent in the former but not in the latter. Because captopril only affected thirst in the rat with ligated ureters whereas it affected both sodium appetite and thirst in the adrenalectomized rat, increases in renal renin secretion alone may not be enough to stimulate sodium appetite. The additional stimulus provided by adrenalectomy, or the absence of some inhibitory factor that may be present after ureteric ligation, is also needed.",

    "310": "The aim of this study was to determine the role of changes in renal arterial pressure (RAP), renal hemodynamics, and tubular reabsorption in mediating the natriuretic and antinatriuretic actions of angiotensin II (ANG II). In seven anesthetized dogs, endogenous ANG II formation was blocked with captopril, and ANG II was infused intravenously at rates of 5-1,215 ng X kg-1 X min-1 while RAP was either servo-controlled at the preinfusion level or permitted to increase. When RAP was servo-controlled, ANG II infusion at all rates from 5-1,215 ng X kg-1 X min-1 decreased urinary sodium excretion (UNaV) and fractional sodium excretion (FENa) while increasing fractional reabsorption of lithium (FRLi) (an index of proximal tubular fractional sodium reabsorption) and causing no change in calculated distal tubule fractional sodium reabsorption (FRDNa). When RAP was permitted to increase, ANG II infusion rates up to 45 ng X kg-1. min-1 also decreased UNaV and FENa while increasing FRLi and causing no change in FRDNa. However, at 135 ng X kg-1 X min-1 and above, UNaV and FENa increased while FRLi and FRDNa decreased when RAP was allowed to rise, even though renal blood flow and filtration fraction were not substantially different from the values observed when RAP was servo-controlled. Filtered sodium load was slightly higher when RAP was permitted to increase during ANG II infusion compared with when RAP was servo-controlled, although the differences were not statistically significant. Thus, even very large doses of ANG II cause antinatriuresis when RAP is prevented from increasing.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "311": "The acute hemodynamic effects, long-term clinical efficacy, and safety of the oral angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, were assessed in a multicenter cooperative study of 124 patients with heart failure resistant to digitalis and diuretics. The cardiac status of most patients was deteriorating prior to the study. Favorable acute hemodynamic effects consistently occurred with captopril. Maximal mean percentage increases in cardiac index, stroke index, and stroke work index were, respectively, 35%, 44%, and 34%. Systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances were each decreased by approximately 40%, as were the filling pressures of the right and left heart. Infusion of nitroprusside in some of the same patients to an end point of a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 12 to 18 mm Hg (equivalent to that after captopril) revealed no significant difference in the effect of either drug on the other hemodynamic parameters. Recatheterization after 8 weeks of captopril therapy revealed sustained hemodynamic changes. Significant and sustained improvements in clinical status were observed in most patients as measured by changes in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification and exercise tolerance times. Seventy-nine percent of patients for whom there were adequate NYHA class data improved. Twenty percent remained unchanged and 1% deteriorated. Those patients who had both pretreatment and post-treatment exercise stress testing exhibited a highly significant mean increase in exercise tolerance times of 34% (317 +/- 32 seconds pretreatment to 425 +/- 34 seconds, final measurement).

    "312": "That local splanchnic ischemia is associated with the acute gastric \"stress\" erosions seen in shock is well established. The hemodynamic mechanism mediating that ischemia is unknown. Pericardial tamponade was produced in anesthetized pigs while hemodynamic parameters were monitored in the systemic circulation as a whole and in the vascular beds of the celiac and left gastric arteries, respectively. Stepwise increases in pericardial pressure produced progressive decreases in arterial pressure and cardiac output (i.e., reproducible, quantitable, and rapidly reversible levels of cardiogenic shock). This produced a profound reduction in blood flow in the celiac and gastric beds that was significantly disproportionate to the reduction in cardiac output. This was due to significant increases in celiac and gastric vascular resistance that were more than twice as great as those seen in the systemic circulation as a whole (i.e., selective splanchnic vasoconstriction). This response was abolished by ablation of the renin-angiotensin axis, whether by bilateral nephrectomy, captopril, or saralasin, and mimicked, without tamponade, by the infusion of angiotensin II. Levels of celiac artery blood flow and resistance correlated significantly with endogenous levels of plasma renin activity. On the other hand, this response was not abolished by confirmed alpha-adrenergic blockade (phenoxybenzamine) or by sympathectomy. In this model, cardiogenic shock produces regional splanchnic ischemia in the celiac and gastric vascular beds by inducing a severe and disproportionate vasospasm that is mediated primarily by the renin-angiotensin axis.", 
    "313": "Plasma free captopril concentrations and haemodynamic response to captopril were studied in 20 patients with severe chronic heart failure. A 25 mg oral dose of captopril produced a 36% reduction in systemic vascular resistance, with individual responses varying from 13% to 64%. Mean systemic pressure fell by 20% and cardiac output rose 28%. The absorption of captopril was rapid. Peak plasma free captopril concentration occurred at 45 minutes after the dose and was followed by a smaller second peak. Peak plasma free captopril concentrations varied more than 20-fold but did not correlate with the maximal reduction in systemic vascular resistance. Elimination half life was seven hours. Fourteen patients were restudied after 1-2 months of captopril treatment and 12 showed symptomatic benefit. There was a sustained improvement in haemodynamic state and in non-invasive indices of myocardial function. During long term treatment the predose plasma free captopril concentration correlated well with dosage, but steady state captopril concentrations did not show a significant relation with haemodynamic response. On a dosage regimen of 25-50 mg three times daily the morning predose plasma free captopril concentration and plasma renin activity were relatively low and suggested that maximal inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system was not maintained throughout the dosage interval.", 
    "314": "Although vasodilator therapy has been shown to improve functional capacity in patients with congestive heart failure, there is no evidence that such therapy can prolong survival. Coronary artery ligation in the rat was used to produce a wide range of myocardial infarct sizes and a resultant spectrum of left ventricular dysfunction. To determine the relationship between size of myocardial infarction and long-term survival and to test the hypothesis that long-term therapy with captopril could improve survival after myocardial infarction, 302 rats were randomly assigned to either placebo or captopril therapy 14 days after coronary artery ligation. The animals were kept in a laminar flow unit and followed daily for a 1 year period or until spontaneous death. Size of myocardial infarction was determined by planimetry of serial histologic sections of the left ventricle. One year survival in placebo-treated rats decreased markedly in direct relation to increasing size of infarction (from 71% in noninfarcted rats to only 8% in rats with large infarcts). Long-term captopril therapy prolonged the survival of rats with infarcts (p less than .02). The most marked improvement in survival was noted in the animals with infarcts of moderate size, in which 1 year survival was 21% in the placebo-treated rats and 48% in the captopril-treated rats. Thus, in this experimental preparation of myocardial infarction and left ventricular dysfunction, survival was inversely related to size of infarction. Long-term therapy with captopril, which we had previously shown to improve left ventricular function and lessen dilatation in the chronic phase of infarction, also had a pronounced effect on prolonging survival in this preparation of chronic infarction.",

The increase in stroke volume index was greater with milrinone than with captopril (28 +/- 7 vs 24 +/- 7 ml/m2; p less than .05), while pulmonary capillary wedge pressures fell similarly (19 +/- 10 vs 21 +/- 7 mm Hg). Mean systemic arterial pressure decreased significantly from 84 +/- 10 to 73 +/- 11 mm Hg (p less than .05) with captopril but did not with milrinone. Neither drug changed heart rate significantly. Although milrinone produced a greater improvement in ventricular performance than captopril, renal blood flow increased similarly with both drugs from 289 +/- 78 to 417 +/- 111 ml/min (p less than .05) and from 278 +/- 77 to 441 +/- 115 ml/min (p less than .05), respectively. Femoral vein oxygen content was increased by milrinone from 7.9 +/- 2.6 to 9.8 +/- 3.0 ml/100 ml (p less than .05) and was not changed by captopril. In seven additional patients, intravenous milrinone, administered at the peak effect of captopril, further augmented stroke volume index from 24 +/- 6 to 32 +/- 6 ml/m2 (p less than .05) and tended to reduce pulmonary capillary wedge pressure further from 20 +/- 8 to 18 +/- 9 mm Hg (p = NS).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "316": "To evaluate the effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition (SQ 20881, CEI) on superficial nephron function of the non-clipped kidney in Goldblatt hypertensive rats in the absence of alterations in renal arterial pressure, control renal arterial pressure (RAP) was reduced first to the range generally obtained during CEI (124 +/- 4 mm Hg). RAP was maintained during the CEI period by adjustment of a suprarenal aortic clamp. At the reduced RAP, whole kidney and single nephron glomerular filtration rates (GFR) were reduced from the hypertensive levels and were lower than the measurements in normotensive control rats. During CEI, whole kidney GFR and single nephron GFR increased by 55 and 42%, respectively. There were decreases in absolute as well as fractional proximal reabsorption rates. In the intermediate nephron segment, fractional reabsorption was decreased, but absolute fluid reabsorption increased in proportion to the increased delivery rate. Proximal tubule and peritubular capillary hydrostatic pressures increased significantly during CEI also. These results indicate that an increased activity of the renin-angiotensin system occurring in Goldblatt hypertensive rats subjected to aortic constriction exerts effects to lower GFR and increase proximal reabsorption rate. The concomitant superficial nephron and whole kidney GFR responses to CEI when arterial pressure was maintained suggests that the pre-existing levels of angiotensin exerted similar influences on the total nephron population.", 
    "317": "Antihypertensive effect of enalapril (MK-421), an orally active non-sulfhydryl-containing converting enzyme inhibitor, was examined in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive (SHRSP) rats. The treatment was started at 14-15 weeks of age with tail blood pressure over 240 mmHg and was continued for 11 weeks. We used captopril as the reference drug. The dose of enalapril and captopril was 10 and 30 mg/kg per day, p.o., respectively. Enalapril showed a sustained antihypertensive effect from the 1st to the 11th week of the treatment. This antihypertensive effect was substantiated by the good increase in body weight; decrease in heart weight; decrease in incidences of vascular disease, nephrosclerosis, stroke and death. Enalapril treatment also prevented the increases in urine volume, and excretion of osmotically active solutes, Na, Cl and K with age. Captopril treatment showed about the same antihypertensive effect. No side effects were seen in the enalapril or captopril treated group. The antihypertensive potency of enalapril was about 3 times more than that of captopril. Enalapril and captopril slightly increased plasma renin concentration. Urinary excretion of PGE2 was not changed by enalapril or captopril treatment. These results clearly demonstrate the efficacy of long-term treatment with enalapril to prevent development of malignant hypertensive cardiovascular disease in SHRSP rats.",

Supernatants were further diluted with 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid buffer, pH 8. Diluted samples were incubated at 37 degrees C with the substrate [3H]hippurylglycylglycine and rabbit lung ACE for 45 min. Acid (1.0 N HCl) was then added, and the product, [3H]hippuric acid, was extracted into a water-immiscible scintillation cocktail. Drug standards were prepared in the biological matrix to correct for drug recovery. A computer program was used to convert radioactivity (dpm) to units of enzyme activity and then correlate enzyme activity with drug concentration. The ester prodrugs fosenopril and enalapril could be assayed down to 4 ng/ml in plasma after ester hydrolysis with NaOH. Drug disposition studies in rats, dogs, and monkeys have demonstrated that the method can be readily adapted to any ACE inhibitor and is suitable for determining drug bioavailability and pharmacokinetics.", 
    "319": "In 15 patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension a new orally active angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, 1-(D-3-acetylthio-2-methylpropanoyl)-L-prolyl-L-phenylalanine (Alacepril), was administered with a single oral dose of 50 mg to evaluate its antihypertensive effect. Following Alacepril plasma angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity was inhibited by approximately 75% within 2 h. Plasma renin activity increased slightly whereas plasma levels of aldosterone decreased significantly. Blood pressure fell markedly not only in patients with high renin levels but also in those with low renin levels. Nevertheless, the magnitude of blood pressure reduction was correlated with the pre-treatment plasma renin values (r = -0.602, p less than 0.05 systolic, r = -0.667, p less than 0.01 diastolic). No relevant changes in pulse rate was observed. These findings demonstrate that in essential hypertension the novel orally active ACE inhibitor Alacepril exerts marked antihypertensive effect, which may offer a new effective approach to treatment of hypertension.", 
    "320": "Hypertension with diabetes mellitus has been associated with suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. We have studied the effects of the converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, on blood pressure, plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma aldosterone in 10 stable hypertensive diabetic subjects and 10 age-matched patients with essential hypertension. There was no clinical evidence of complication in the diabetic subjects and their diabetic treatment remained unchanged throughout the study. Mean captopril doses used were similar in both groups. In the diabetics and the essential hypertensives, treatment resulted in a significant and similar decrease in blood pressure. Pre-treatment basal and stimulated PRA and the change of PRA with captopril were also similar. Pre-treatment stimulated plasma aldosterone and the response of aldosterone to postural stress was significantly lower in the diabetic group, suggesting an impaired adrenal responsiveness to stress. Despite this, our findings indicate that the hypotensive action of captopril is at least as effective in hypertension associated with otherwise uncomplicated diabetes mellitus as in essential hypertension.",

The outcome was uniformly fatal. These results suggest that in the hepatorenal syndrome, captopril in standard dosage is without benefit, and provide further evidence that the changes in the renin-angiotensin system are probably secondary to reduced renal perfusion from some other cause.",

Untreated group 1 rats exhibited systemic hypertension and elevation of the single nephron glomerular filtration rate (SNGFR) due to high average values for the mean glomerular transcapillary hydraulic pressure difference and glomerular plasma flow rate. In group 2 rats, treatment with enalapril prevented systemic hypertension and maintained the mean glomerular transcapillary hydraulic pressure gradient at near-normal levels without significantly compromising SNGFR and the glomerular capillary plasma flow rate, as compared with untreated group 1 rats. Groups 3 and 4 were studied 8 wk after renal ablation. Untreated group 3 rats demonstrated persistent systemic hypertension, progressive proteinuria, and glomerular structural lesions, including mesangial expansion and segmental sclerosis. In group 4 rats, treatment with enalapril maintained systemic blood pressure at normal levels over the 8-wk period and significantly limited the development of proteinuria and glomerular lesions. These studies suggest that control of glomerular hypertension effectively limits glomerular injury in rats with renal ablation, and further support the view that glomerular hemodynamic changes mediate progressive renal injury when nephron number is reduced.", 
    "327": "Angiotensin II, the biologically active component of the renin-angiotensin system, acts throughout the body to produce an impressive number of cardiovascular, endocrine, metabolic, and behavioral effects. Major actions include elevation of arterial pressure, stimulation of aldosterone secretion, and a variety of effects on the kidneys, brain, and pituitary. Investigation of the role of the renin-angiotensin system in physiological regulation has been greatly facilitated by the availability of specific inhibitors of the formation or actions of angiotensin II, most notably converting-enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists. Studies with these agents have clearly shown that the renin-angiotensin system plays an important role in the defense of body balance and blood pressure in hypovolemic state, including sodium deficiency and hemorrhage. The inhibitors also lower blood pressure in some forms of hypertension, and converting-enzyme inhibitors are proving to be effective antihypertensive agents.", 
    "328": "Serum and CSF angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) were measured by a new inhibitor binding assay in 32 patients with sarcoidosis, 49 with neurologic diseases, and 38 controls. In neurosarcoidosis, 11 of 20 patients had high levels of CSF ACE. In systemic sarcoidosis without neurologic abnormality, only 1 of 12 patients had elevated CSF ACE. The highest value was observed in a patient with widespread meningeal sarcoidosis. High values were also observed in patients with bacterial meningitis or malignant tumors of the CNS. Fluctuation in successive analyses correlated to clinical course of neurosarcoidosis. CSF ACE analysis seems useful in diagnosis and follow-up of neurosarcoidosis.", 
    "329": "The carboxylic acid group on the proline of 1 was replaced by a phosphoric acid, a hydroxamic acid, and a tetrazole to give compounds 2-4, respectively. Testing of 2-4 as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors gave I50 values of 100, 1.6, and 22 microM, respectively, compared to 0.07 microM for 1. A hydroxamic acid derivative of the ketomethylene pentapeptide analogue 18 was then synthesized. This compound, 17, had an ACE I50 of 0.011 microM compared to 0.0076 microM for 18. Oral administration of 10 mg/kg of 17 to renal hypertensive rats had no effect on blood pressure or heart rate.", 
    "330": "Two pentapeptide analogues of the ketomethylene-containing angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor 5(S)-benzamido-4-oxo-6-phenylhexanoyl-L-proline (1) were synthesized and evaluated as ACE inhibitors and antihypertensive agents. Compounds 14 and 15 were very potent ACE inhibitors with I50 values of 7.0 and 3.0 nM, respectively, compared to an I50 value of 70 nM for 1. Neither 14 nor 15 showed significant blood pressure lowering activity in renal hypertensive rats. Investigations conducted on a tritiated analogue of 14 showed that 70% of an oral dose of this compound is absorbed but is rapidly excreted from the blood with a half life of 24 min. Thin-layer chromatography of bile and urine contents in rats given tritiated 14 orally showed that it is excreted in greater than 90% unchanged form. This implies that a ketomethylene linkage can stabilize peptide amide linkages adjacent to it to peptidase degradation.", 
    "331": "The kinetics of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition by captopril (SQ 14225) and enalapril (MK 421) in anesthetized rabbits was investigated. Kinetic parameters, apparent Km, an index of enzyme-substrate affinity and apparent Vmax, a measure of maximal rate of substrate conversion, were determined from indicator dilution measurements of single pass pulmonary metabolism of a synthetic ACE substrate [3H]benzoyl-phenylalanyl-alanyl-proline. Two methods for determination of kinetics in vivo from metabolism data were used. One fit pulmonary venous outflow metabolism data to a nonlinear model of saturable lung metabolic processes. This method required injection of sufficient substrate (benzoyl-phenylalanyl-alanyl-proline) to produce a large range of intravascular substrate concentrations. An alternative method required use of only low intravascular substrate concentrations. Both methods rely primarily on similar Michaelis-Menten assumptions and generated very similar results. Both captopril (10 and 20 nmol/kg) and enalapril (4 and 7 nmol/kg) behaved as noncompetitive ACE inhibitors in vivo. ACE inhibition was characterized by depressed [3H]benzoyl-phenylalanyl-alanyl-proline hydrolysis and apparent Vmax whereas apparent Km was unaffected. Other studies have suggested that these inhibitors act as competitive or mixed competitive and noncompetitive ACE inhibitors in vitro. Significant differences, however, between in vivo and in vitro experimental conditions suggest that the kinetics of enzyme inhibition in vitro may not necessarily reflect the action of the inhibitor in vivo. Additionally, results obtained in vivo may more accurately reflect the therapeutic behavior of these compounds.", 
    "332": "The effect of enalaprilat (MK-422), a newly synthesized, intravenous, nonsulfhydryl, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, was studied in seven patients with either severe or malignant hypertension. All subjects initially received a 1 mg bolus injection of enalaprilat followed in 30 minutes by 10 mg. Five subjects received an additional 40 mg. Mean (+/- SE) pretreatment blood pressure for the group was 226 +/- 9/141 +/- 7 mm Hg. Five minutes after the 1 mg enalaprilat dose, blood pressure decreased to 211 +/- 10/131 +/- 9 mm Hg and further fell to 201 +/- 14/123 +/- 11 mm Hg at 30 minutes. The maximal reduction in blood pressure to 169 +/- 14/112 +/- 10 mm Hg occurred 30 minutes after the 10 mg dose. No further blood pressure reduction was observed in those subjects who received the additional 40 mg dose. Within the entire group, five subjects exhibited sustained blood pressure reduction. No adverse side effects or symptomatic hypotension occurred in any subject.", 
    "333": "High activity of renin was demonstrated in human neuroblastoma tissue. This activity was inhibited by specific antibody raised against human renal renin, indicating that it was not due to the nonspecific action of proteases. The specific activity of renin was 122.8 ng of angiotensin I generated mg of protein-1 h-1. It shared some biochemical features with well-known kidney renin, such as molecular weight, optimum pH, the presence of trypsin-activatable inactive renin, and glycoprotein nature. Furthermore, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity (2.64 nmol mg of protein-1 min-1) was found in the tissue. This activity was inhibited by captopril, a specific ACE inhibitor, or by omission of chloride ion. These results suggest that true renin in addition to ACE exists in human neuroblastoma tissue.", 
    "334": "This paper presents a review of studies dealing with combined beta-adrenoceptor blockade and vasodilatation in the treatment of hypertension. This therapy can be achieved either through the combined use of conventional beta-adrenoceptor blocking compounds given together with vasodilator drugs or with agents which show multiple action of this kind. From a hemodynamic point of view this therapeutic approach is quite logical since most forms of established hypertension are characterized by increased vascular resistance. It can therefore be concluded that combined beta-adrenoceptor blockade and vasodilation offers a rational and useful treatment of hypertension.", 
    "335": "Vasodilator drugs were initially administered to patients with primary pulmonary hypertension based on the unproven hypothesis that pulmonary vasoconstriction played an important role in the pathogenesis of the disease. There were early reports of hemodynamic and clinical improvement after treatment with various vasodilating agents, but subsequent experience did not confirm these uncontrolled observations, and emphasized the limitations and hazards of this approach. Vasodilator therapy generally fails to reduce pulmonary vascular resistance selectively during long-term administration and frequently leads to systemic hypotension, exacerbation of the pulmonary hypertensive state, worsening of right ventricular failure, and systemic arterial desaturation. Beneficial hemodynamic responses are seen in only 15% to 25% of patients. Vasodilator therapy should not be considered an established treatment of patients with primary pulmonary hypertension.", 
    "336": "We demonstrated that potassium depletion significantly increased gentamicin nephrotoxicity in Sprague-Dawley rats (100 mg X kg-1 X day-1). To determine whether this enhanced toxicity was mediated by renin secretion, we evaluated the effect of a converting enzyme inhibitor in this model. When we administered the combination of captopril (100 mg X kg-1 X day-1) and gentamicin in potassium-depleted rats, we observed a surprising and significant adverse effect of this combination on the clearances of inulin (CIn) and PAH (CPAH) and renal blood flow (RBF). Pretreatment with indomethacin significantly improved CIn and CPAH, and potassium repletion abolished this effect entirely. In potassium-depleted animals that received both gentamicin and captopril, the intra-arterial administration of imidazole, a thromboxane synthetase inhibitor, significantly reduced urinary TXB2 excretion and significantly improved RBF and CIn in vivo. In the same group of animals, administration of the kallikrein antagonist aprotinin also significantly increased both RBF and CIn. To measure total renal thromboxane B2 production (TXB2), we perfused kidneys ex vivo with cell-free perfusate. Three groups of animals were studied: potassium-repleted control animals, potassium-depleted control animals, and potassium-depleted animals treated with gentamicin alone, captopril alone, or the combination of gentamicin and captopril. We measured TXB2 in renal venous effluent by radioimmunoassay. Ex vivo perfused kidneys from potassium-depleted control animals produced significantly more TXB2 than potassium-repleted controls. Kidneys from potassium-depleted animals that received both gentamicin and captopril produced significantly greater amounts of TXB2 than did kidneys from potassium-depleted animals treated with captopril alone, gentamicin alone, or control potassium-depleted kidneys. The administration of imidazole ex vivo at a rate equivalent to in vivo administration (10 microM/min) reduced TXB2 production by potassium-depleted kidneys that received the combination of gentamicin and captopril to that of potassium-repleted control kidneys. These results suggest that the deleterious effect of captopril in potassium-depleted rats that received gentamicin is due at least in part to kinin-stimulated renal TXB2 production.", 
    "337": "The hypotension and bradycardia observed after intravenous injection of dextran sulfate in rabbits was prevented by prior depletion of circulating platelets, but was not prevented by depletion of the third component of complement or Hageman factor. Dextran sulfate injection caused immediate thrombocytopenia with temporary localization of platelets within lungs. Morphological analysis revealed platelet aggregates in lung capillaries. The platelets had changed shape and were in the process of degranulating. Serotonin and histamine levels in blood increased approximately 5-fold and 7-fold, respectively, after dextran sulfate injection. The cardiovascular events following dextran sulfate injection were mimicked by intravenous serotonin but not by intravenous histamine injection, although a combination of serotonin and histamine reproduced the pattern of blood pressure changes better than did either agent alone. Quantification of platelets trapped in lung revealed that the potential release of serotonin from trapped platelets could account for the rise in plasma serotonin concentration and the hemodynamic changes observed. Both the dextran sulfate-induced cardiovascular effects and serotonin-induced hypotension were markedly diminished by cutting vagus and depressor nerves, and were virtually abolished by carotid ligation in addition to nerve section. These results support the concept that platelet activation within rabbit lungs may cause hypotension via serotonin-induced chemoreflexes.", 
    "338": "Tritium and Carbon 14 analogs of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor ketoACE were synthesized and their oral absorption, metabolism and excretion in rats were investigated. KetoACE, a ketomethylene analog of the tripeptide Bz-Phe-Gly-Pro, was slowly absorbed at a 35% level upon oral administration. It is rapidly eliminated from the blood with a half-life of about 10 minutes. Its excretion is primarily via the bile duct and it is excreted as 80% unchanged drug. The only identified metabolite consisting of 5-10% of the excreted radioactivity was determined to be the reduced ketoACE in which the ketone group was reduced to a hydroxyl.", 
    "339": "The role of converting enzyme (CE) in heart function was studied by assessing the inhibition of CE activity in rat heart tissue and in isolated perfused hearts from rat, guinea-pig and rabbit (Langendorff technique). Angiotensin I (ANG I) added to the perfusate reduced coronary flow (FLO) in all species, increased force of contraction (CON) in rats, decreased CON in guinea-pigs and had no effect on CON in rabbits. In contrast, bradykinin (BK) increased FLO in all species, decreased CON in rats, increased CON in guinea-pigs and had no effect on CON in rabbits. The CE inhibitors ramipril (HOE498) 1 mg/kg and enalapril (MK421) 30 mg/kg given orally 1 h prior to killing of the animals inhibited the ANG I effects and potentiated the BK effects but had no effects on the action of ANG II. The same doses of the two CE inhibitors produced up to 24 h inhibition of CE activity measured biochemically in the heart after single oral doses. Electrical sympathetic stimulation of the cardiac nerves (SNS) in isolated rabbit heart resulted in an increase of HR and CON and in an initial decrease and subsequent increase of FLO. The effects of SNS on HR and FLO were significantly reduced following HOE498 (1 mg/kg) pretreatment. The results suggest that local CE is involved in the regulation of peptide effects in the heart, including the ANG II-mediated facilitation of neurotransmission.", 
    "340": "A comparative, controlled, open hypertension study using the direct vasodilator endralazine and the ACE-inhibitor captopril in combined therapy for severe and moderately severe hypertension is described. Both vasodilators cause an approximately 20% reduction in supine and upright blood pressure. Extreme side effects such as hematological alterations, autoimmune states or uncontrollable water retention were not observed. Subjective symptoms, particularly severe headaches, were especially evident after endralazine use. This side effect may possibly be eliminated by gradual titration over several weeks.", 
    "341": "Mechanisms controlling the local generation of angiotensin II by vascular tissue are incompletely understood. Human platelets were examined for their ability to metabolize angiotensin I. Platelet-dependent angiotensin I metabolism was detected by a high performance liquid chromatography assay which allowed quantitation of angiotensin I substrate utilized and products formed. The major product of platelet-dependent angiotensin I metabolism was identified as des-Leu10-angiotensin I. The platelet des-Leu10-angiotensin I-generating activity had a pH optimum of 6.0-6.5 and was inhibited 100% by mersalyl acid (10(-4) M), 86% by leupeptin (10(-4) M), and 95% by iodoacetamide (10(-2) M). The activity had an approximate Mr = 70,000 as determined by Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration. Intact human platelets stimulated with calcium ionophore (1-10 microM) released 13.7-30.8% of the des-Leu10-angiotensin I-generating activity. Des-Leu10-angiotensin I, the major product of platelet angiotensin I metabolism, inhibited human serum and purified rabbit lung angiotensin-converting enzymes with an I50 of 3.7 X 10(-6) and 2.0 X 10(-6) M, respectively. These results suggest that the platelet may control local angiotensin II formation at vascular sites both by metabolism of the precursor peptide angiotensin I and by generation of an endogenous angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, des-Leu10-angiotensin I. This platelet-dependent pathway may contribute to the control of local levels of vasoactive peptides, such as bradykinin and angiotensin II, so as to alter local tissue blood flow.", 
    "342": "There is much circumstantial and some direct evidence in humans to suggest that a high consumption of salt predisposes communities and individuals to the development of essential hypertension. Recent work has suggested possible mechanisms whereby a high salt intake could cause a rise in blood pressure in genetically susceptible persons. Restriction of salt intake in the diet lowers blood pressure in many subjects with high blood pressure and this fall in blood pressure is mediated in part by a diminished renin response to sodium restriction as hypertension develops. The effect of sodium restriction, like diuretics, is additive to most blood pressure lowering drugs, particularly those that inhibit the renin system such as beta-blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Claims that a slight reduction in calcium intake may be important in the development of high blood pressure are disputed. Furthermore, no satisfactory hypothesis has been put forward to explain how a small reduction in dietary calcium intake could cause high blood pressure. Large increases in calcium intake have been reported to lower blood pressure in both normotensive and hypertensive humans. The three published studies, however, are not in agreement.", 
    "343": "A 34-year-old white man with generalized neurofibromatosis was found to have severe renal vascular hypertension due to a coarctation of the abdominal aorta and bilateral renal artery stenosis with saccular aneurysms. Increased renal venous renin activity showed the active involvement of the renin-angiotensin system in maintaining the hypertension. Because the patient refused surgical treatment, antihypertensive treatment with Captopril, a specific inhibitor of the angiotensin converting enzyme was used, resulting in normal blood pressure being restored over an 18 month observation period.", 
    "344": "The radioactive microsphere technique was used to study the systemic and regional haemodynamic effects of the converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (0.1, 0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg) 10 min after intravenous administration in conscious rabbits with bilateral cellophane perinephritis hypertension, an experimental model of hypertension associated with normal plasma renin levels. Captopril lowered arterial blood pressure as a result of a dose-dependent decrease in total peripheral resistance. The fall in blood pressure was accompanied by an increase in cardiac output after the second and third dose of captopril; heart rate was not significantly altered. Captopril produced a generalized peripheral vasodilatation; the changes in vascular conductance being most pronounced in the kidneys, intestines and skin which resulted in a significant increase in blood flow to these vascular beds. The effective antihypertensive properties of captopril in this 'low plasma renin' model of hypertension and the uniform increase in vascular conductances produced by captopril, which antagonizes the generalized increase in vascular resistances that characterizes cellophane perinephritis hypertension, may indicate the involvement of an increased activity of the renin-angiotensin system, possibly in tissues, such as the vascular wall and brain, in the maintenance of the elevated blood pressure in this hypertensive form.", 
    "345": "In order to investigate the validity of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition with captopril as a screening test for primary aldosteronism (PA), 50 mg of captopril were administered orally to 7 patients with PA, 17 with essential hypertension (EH), 5 with renovascular hypertension (RVH), 2 with renoparenchymal hypertension (RH) and 8 normal volunteers. The plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) was suppressed to less than 15 ng/dl in all of the EH, RVH and RH patients and normal subjects 90 min after administration of captopril, but not suppressed in 6 of 7 patients with PA. In addition, the plasma renin activity (PRA) was increased to greater than 1 ng/ml/h in 10 of 17 patients with EH and in all with RVH, RH and the normal controls, but to less than that in 6 of 7 PA and the remaining EH patients. The PAC to PRA ratio after captopril was greater than 20 in all patients with PA, while it remained below 20 in EH, RVH and RH patients and normal controls. From these results, we conclude that the PAC to PRA ratio in the captopril administration test is a simple and useful tool to detect PA in hypertensive patients. In addition, the test has a great advantage in that it can be safely applied to outpatients with relatively severe hypertension.", 
    "346": "Kainic acid, an analogue of L-glutamate, was microinjected into the nucleus tractus solitarii of cordotomized rats. Kainic acid (30 ng) injected bilaterally into the nucleus elicited hypertension. The pressor response to kainic acid was restricted to sites in the intermediate one-third of the nucleus tractus solitarii. Plasma vasopressin levels were markedly increased during the kainic acid-induced pressor response. Intravenous injection of atropine sulphate or mecamylamine, or intraventricular injection of captopril did not affect the pressor response. It is concluded that in cordotomized rats the pressor response to kainic acid injected into the nucleus tractus solitarii is mainly mediated via increased release of vasopressin. It seems unlikely that the central cholinergic and angiotensin mechanisms are mainly responsible for the response to kainic acid.", 
    "347": "We review results from several rat models of dehydration in which increases in the rate of glucose utilization were found in the subfornical organ and in other cerebral structures participating in the regulation of thirst and fluid balance. During chronic saline ingestion, the simplest model of dehydration involving only plasma hypertonicity, glucose utilization in the subfornical organ was normal. In water-sated homozygous Brattleboro rats, in which plasma osmolality and levels of angiotensin II are increased, glucose metabolism in the subfornical organ was 44% higher than in water-sated Long-Evans rats. In a complex model of dehydration, chronic water deprivation which is associated with high levels of plasma osmolality, angiotensin II, and baroreceptor disinhibition, there was a 72% increase in subfornical organ glucose utilization. The results suggest that angiotensin II is an important stimulant of metabolism in the subfornical organ, and that converging stimuli have a synergistic effect on metabolic activity in this structure.", 
    "348": "Cerebral vasospasm following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage is one of the most important causes of cerebral ischemia, and is the leading cause of death and disability after aneurysm rupture. There are two definitions of cerebral vasospasm: angiographic and clinical. Care must be exercised to be certain that it is clear which entity is being addressed. The diagnosis of the clinical syndrome is one of exclusion and can rarely be made with absolute certainty. The pathogenesis of cerebral vasospasm is poorly understood. Most current theories focus on the release of factors from the subarachnoid clot. More attention must be given to the role of endothelial damage and alterations in the blood-arterial wall barrier. The application of modern techniques for studying vascular smooth muscle which have been developed as a result of research in the areas of hypertension and atherosclerosis must be applied to the problem of cerebral vasospasm. A stress test to select patients with angiographic arterial narrowing who have adequate cerebral vascular reserve to undergo surgery should be developed. The optimal treatment of vasospasm awaits development of agents for blocking or inactivating spasmogenic substances or blocking arterial smooth muscle contraction. Rheological or hemodynamic manipulations to prevent or reverse ischemic consequences of vasospasm are relatively effective, but complicated and hazardous, and should be viewed principally as interim measures awaiting development of more specific therapies for the arterial narrowing.", 
    "349": "The role of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in modulating the renal hemodynamic and functional responses to hypoxemia was studied in chronically catheterized fetal lambs (132-143 days gestation; term 145 days) before and during administration of either captopril or [Sar1-Gly8]ANG II. Base-line mean arterial blood pressure decreased significantly after administration of either captopril or [Sar1-Gly8]ANG II. This decrease was associated with a significant decline in renal vascular resistance (RVR) in captopril-treated fetuses, whereas no changes in RVR were observed in [Sar1-Gly8]ANG II-treated fetuses. However, the decline in renal blood flow (RBF) and the rise in RVR associated with hypoxemia in control fetuses were not attenuated significantly during inhibition of the RAS using either captopril or [Sar1-Gly8]ANG II. Moreover neither captopril nor [Sar1-Gly8]ANG II blunted the hypertensive response associated with fetal hypoxemia. The renal functional response to captopril was different from the response observed during infusion of [Sar1-Gly8]ANG II. Administration of [Sar1-Gly8]ANG II produced significant decreases in urinary flow rate (UFR), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and urinary electrolyte (Na+, K+, Cl-) excretion rates, whereas no changes were observed during captopril infusion. The effects of hypoxemia on renal function were not modified after captopril. However, [Sar1-Gly8]ANG II tended to increase UFR and GFR, but these changes were pressure-dependent and not directly related to inhibition of the RAS. This study suggests that the RAS is not an important mediator of the fetal renal hemodynamic and functional responses to hypoxemia.", 
    "350": "Angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor and has profound effects on autonomic neural mechanisms in experimental animals. Human carotid baroreflex control of arterial pressure and heart period was examined before and after acutely decreasing angiotensin II levels by administering 50 mg of oral captopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. Carotid baroreceptor stimuli were delivered by a neck chamber worn by 14 normotensive volunteers. Four subjects received placebo. Arterial pressure responses to carotid distention and tachycardia in response to carotid compression were not changed in captopril or placebo groups; however, there was an augmented bradycardic response to carotid stretch in captopril-treated subjects. These results indicate that captopril has an asymmetrical effect on carotid baroreflex function and suggest that enhanced baroreflex mediated bradycardia is due to a reduction in central nervous system angiotensin II levels by captopril, which augments vagal-cardiac responses to carotid stimuli.", 
    "351": "To determine whether the relationship between infarct size and ventricular performance, volume, and compliance could be altered favorably, captopril was administered to rats for 3 months following coronary artery ligation. Baseline left and right ventricular and systemic arterial pressures and aortic blood flow, and maximal stroke volume and cardiac indices attained during a volume loading, were measured. Passive pressure-volume relations of the left ventricle were determined, and the slopes of segments of this relation were analyzed to characterize ventricular chamber stiffness. In untreated rats, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure progressively rose (from 5-28 mm Hg) as a function of infarct size, whereas, in captopril-treated rats, filling pressure remained within normal limits (5 +/- 1 mm Hg) in all but those with extensive infarcts. Chronic captopril therapy reduced baseline mean arterial pressure and total peripheral resistance, yet maintained cardiac and stroke outputs in rats both with and without infarcts. In untreated rats, maximal pumping ability progressively declined with increasing infarct size, whereas, in captopril-treated rats, peak stroke volume index remained within normal limits in all but those with extensive infarcts. The in vitro left ventricular volumes of captopril-treated rats were significantly less than those of untreated rats. The maintenance of forward output from a lesser dilated left ventricle yielded an index of ejection fraction for treated rats with moderate and large infarcts that was significantly elevated compared with that of untreated rats with infarcts of comparable size. Left ventricular chamber stiffness, which fell as infarct size increased in untreated rats, was normalized by chronic captopril therapy. Thus, captopril attenuated the left ventricular remodeling (dilation) and deterioration in performance that were observed in rats with chronic myocardial infarction.", 
    "352": "The retina, choroid, ciliary body, iris and aqueous humor of swine eyes contain enzymes capable of producing (kallikrein) and inactivating (kininase I and II) kinins. The activity of the enzymes varies in different eye structures. Higher activities of kallikrein and kininase II were found in highly vascularized tissues such as retina, choroid and ciliary body. The highest activity of kininase I (carboxypeptidase N) was found in the aqueous humor. The presence of these enzymes in the eye structures suggests a possible role for them in local metabolism of vasoactive peptides.", 
    "353": "We studied the effect of halothane, enflurane and isoflurane on angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity using [3H]-benzoyl-phenylalanyl-alanyl-proline (BPAP) as a substrate. Isolated rabbit lungs were perfused in a recirculating system in vitro with BPAP in Krebs-Ringer solution. The rate of metabolism and per cent metabolism were determined before and after treatment for 30 minutes with four MAC multiples of enflurane, halothane or isoflurane. The effects of the anaesthetics on ACE activity were determined by calculating per cent inhibition of metabolism of BPAP using data from the control and test period for each lung. The average metabolism of BPAP at 15 minutes during the control period was 76.5 per cent (+/- 1.92 SEM). No anaesthetic significantly inhibited metabolism of BPAP. Likewise there was no effect on BPAP first order kinetics. Although potent inhalation anaesthetics may alter the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis, they do not affect this crucial step.", 
    "354": "The effect of different oral doses of HOE 498, a new non-sulphydryl containing converting enzyme inhibitor, was investigated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in normotensive volunteers. Dose-related reductions in serum converting enzyme activity, plasma angiotensin II and aldosterone were seen, greater at 4 h than at 12 h after drug ingestion. Converse dose-related increases in blood angiotensin I and plasma active renin concentration occurred. Falls of angiotensin II were as great with 20 mg as with 50 mg of HOE 498, although the effect was more prolonged with 50 mg. The reductions in concentrations of plasma angiotensin II and serum converting enzyme activity and the increases in plasma renin concentration were correlated with the concentration of HOE 498 - diacid in plasma. Dose-related falls in both supine and erect blood pressure were maximal 2-3.5 h after dosing. Pulse rate increased marginally but insignificantly in the supine; slightly and significantly in the upright position, concomitantly with the blood pressure reduction at all doses of active drug. We conclude that effects of single doses of HOE 498 on the renin-angiotensin system are maximal within 4 h, but are still apparent after 24 h. Thus it is likely that once daily administration will be adequate for treatment of high blood pressure in patients.", 
    "355": "Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors reduce blood pressure without reflex tachycardia, possibly as a result of enhanced hypothesis that this results from the removal of the parasympathetic activity. We examined the vagolytic action of angiotensin II or alternatively by acetylcholinesterase inhibition. Both captopril and [Sar1ala8] angiotensin II, (saralasin), caused modest falls in blood pressure, without increasing heart rate in normotensive subjects. Captopril and saralasin significantly attenuated the vagally mediated heart rate slowing after facial immersion in water. There was a close correlation between the effects produced by captopril and saralasin on the diving reflex. Infusion of subpressor doses of angiotensin II, reversed the hypotensive effect of captopril and returned the bradycardia after facial immersion to placebo level. In vitro neither captopril nor enalapril or lisinopril affected bovine erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase activity. The parasympathetic effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors appear to reflect a direct consequence of the removal of angiotensin II.", 
    "356": "Removal of [14C]captopril by the lungs of anesthetized rabbits was measured by the multiple indicator dilution technique. After coinjection of indocyanine green (ICG) and [14C]captopril into the jugular vein of anesthetized rabbits, serial blood samples were collected from the carotid artery and each was analyzed for its content of both substances. Percent removal (R) of captopril after its initial injection of 10 nmoles captopril/kg (calculated at the peak of the ICG outflow curve) was 40.2 +/- 2.5 (S.E.M.) and was significantly greater than R after a second injection of 10 nmoles captopril/kg (20.1 +/- 2.4) 1 hr later. Removal of 70 nmoles captopril/kg (5.8 +/- 3.0 after first injection, 6.4 +/- 2.2 after second injection) was significantly lower than R of 10 nmoles captopril/kg. During a single pulmonary passage of either dose of captopril, R was inversely related to the calculated fractional concentration of intravascular captopril. Pulmonary metabolism of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) substrate [3H]benzoyl-Phe-Ala-Pro [( 3H]BPAP) was 70.1 +/- 1.7% in the absence of captopril, and was reduced significantly to 27.4 +/- 2.4% by 10 nmoles captopril/kg and 7.6 +/- 0.2% by 6 mumoles BPAP/kg. BPAP (6.4 +/- 0.6 mumoles/kg) significantly reduced R of the first and second injections of 10 nmoles captopril/kg but this effect was selective, since BPAP did not reduce pulmonary removal of [14C]serotonin. These data indicate that pulmonary removal of captopril in vivo is saturable and may primarily reflect binding of the drug to pulmonary endothelial ACE.", 
    "357": "A dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase, which cleaved the Gly3-Phe4 bond of enkephalins, was purified from guinea pig serum 420-fold. The optimum pH of the enzyme was in the neutral range (pH 7.25), and the molecular weight was estimated to be approx. 280,000. The enzyme hydrolyzed Met- and Leu-enkephalin with Km values of 0.30 and 0.50 mM, respectively. The enzyme was inhibited by metal chelators and p-chloro-mercuribenzoate. Captopril showed high inhibitory potency, while phosphoramidon and Phe-Ala showed no effect on the enzyme activity. Therefore, the obtained enzyme can be classified as an angiotensin-converting enzyme (EC 3.4.15.1). Among the bioactive peptides examined, bradykinin and angiotensin I were hydrolyzed by the enzyme. Angiotensin III showed a stronger inhibitory effect than that of angiotensin II. Substance P, gastrin I, and secretin were also inhibitory toward the enzyme activity. On high-performance liquid chromatography analysis, Met-enkephalin-Arg6-Phe7 and Leu-enkephalin-Arg6 were cleaved sequentially at the second peptide bond of the C terminus. Thus, the dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase in guinea pig serum may play a role not only in the angiotensin-bradykinin system but also in the metabolism of circulating enkephalins and other bioactive peptides.", 
    "358": "The contribution of arginine vasopressin (AVP) to the maintenance of mean arterial pressure (MAP) during fluid deprivation was reinvestigated in chronically prepared, conscious, freely moving rats. In normal Long-Evans (LE) rats during water deprivation for up to 48 h plasma AVP levels increased from 2.98 +/- 0.62 to 17.55 +/- 2.03 pg/ml, but MAP and heart rate (HR) remained unchanged. Fluid deprivation for 10 h in Brattleboro homozygous rats that are unable to synthetize vasopressin resulted in a more severe water depletion than 48 h of dehydration in the normal rats, but also in this group MAP and HR were maintained at values not significantly different from control. Cardiac output (CO) fell during the course of dehydration in both LE and Brattleboro rats. Injection of 20 micrograms/kg of the vasopressin pressor antagonist, 1-deamino-penicillamine, 2-(O-methyl)-tyrosine AVP [dPTyr(Me)AVP] did not decrease MAP or increase HR in LE rats after 24 h of water deprivation and was ineffective even after 48 h of fluid deprivation. CO also remained unchanged following AVP blockade. Efficacy of the antagonist was verified by complete inhibition of the pressor response elicited by exogenous AVP. The concentration of plasma catecholamines was unaltered by dPTyr(Me)AVP. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system via converting-enzyme inhibition failed to reveal any depressor effect after injection of dPTyr(Me)AVP. Thus it appears that AVP is not involved in the maintenance of blood pressure after fluid deprivation in conscious rats.", 
    "359": "Enalapril is a recently developed angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor that improves cardiac function at rest in patients with congestive heart failure. This study investigated the acute effects of enalapril on the cardiovascular response to exercise, and then evaluated the long-term effects of enalapril on exercise capacity and functional status during a 12 week placebo-controlled trial in patients with heart failure. Ten patients underwent hemodynamic monitoring while at rest and during incremental bicycle exercise before and after 5 to 10 mg of enalapril orally. At rest, enalapril decreased mean blood pressure 13% (p less than 0.01) and systemic vascular resistance 20% (p less than 0.05) and increased stroke volume index 21% (p less than 0.01). During maximal exercise, enalapril decreased systemic vascular resistance and increased both cardiac and stroke volume indexes. Enalapril acutely increased exercise duration (p less than 0.05) and maximal oxygen consumption (p less than 0.001). These 10 patients and an additional 13 patients were then randomized to either placebo or enalapril treatment and followed up for 12 weeks. Of the 11 patients assigned to active treatment, 73% considered themselves improved compared with 25% of the patients assigned to placebo treatment (p less than 0.02). During long-term treatment, exercise capacity increased in patients receiving enalapril (p less than 0.001) but was unchanged in patients receiving placebo (intergroup difference, p less than 0.05). During long-term treatment, no adverse effects of enalapril occurred. Thus, enalapril improves cardiac function at rest and during exercise. Compared with placebo, maintenance therapy with enalapril results in symptomatic improvement and increased exercise capacity.", 
    "360": "The contribution of vasopressin and angiotensin II to the maintenance of blood pressure after short-term autonomic blockade was investigated in conscious Long-Evans and Brattleboro (vasopressin-deficient; hereditary diabetes insipidus) rats. After short-term autonomic blockade by atropine (1 mg/kg), propranolol (5 mg/kg), and pentolinium (5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg/hr), the fall in blood pressure was significantly greater in Brattleboro rats than in Long-Evans rats (48 +/- 3 vs 32 +/- 2 mm Hg; p less than 0.01). Administration of the vasopressin vascular receptor antagonist D(CH2)5Tyr-(Me)AVP (2 micrograms/kg) caused further blood pressure decreases only in Long-Evans rats, so that the final blood pressure in both groups was identical. Administration of enalaprilat (10 mg/kg), an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, further reduced blood pressure in both strains. When enalaprilat was given first after autonomic blockade, it reduced blood pressure in Brattleboro rats but not in Long-Evans rats. Administration of the vasopressin antagonist after enalaprilat further reduced blood pressure only in Long-Evans rats. The fall in blood pressure following vasopressin blockade was greater than that occurring after angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition (14 +/- 1 vs 6 +/- 1 mm Hg; p less than 0.05) in autonomic blockade Long-Evans rats. Plasma levels of vasopressin in Long-Evans rats increased markedly after short-term autonomic blockade, whereas plasma renin and angiotensin II levels were unchanged. Plasma angiotensin II levels were increased by the vasopressin antagonist and decreased by enalaprilat. We conclude that, due to sympathetic nervous system blockade and consequent blunting of renal renin release, vasopressin has a greater capacity than the renin-angiotensin system for maintaining blood pressure after short-term autonomic blockade.", 
    "361": "Numerous previous studies have proposed a salt-conserving role for the renin-angiotensin system in mammals, but there is little evidence of this putative role in birds. Especially interesting are marine birds, which have a relatively limited ability to regulate the osmolality and ionic composition of their urine but possess extrarenal salt glands capable of excreting a highly concentrated NaCl solution. In the present experiments, hypertonic saline, angiotensin I (ANG I), and captopril were infused iv into chronically cannulated ducks to study the neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, renal, and extrarenal excretory responses to osmotic stress. Infusion of hypertonic saline elicited nasal salt excretion, which could be stopped completely by coadministration of ANG I. The effective dose of ANG I increased the plasma norepinephrine (NE) concentration, but did not alter heart rate or arterial blood pressure. Captopril enhanced extrarenal salt excretion in the saline-loaded ducks. The converting enzyme inhibitor also blocked the noradrenergic and NaCl-retaining actions of ANG I; conversely, coadministration of captopril and ANG I increased the plasma epinephrine (E) concentration. These findings indicate that the renin-angiotensin system, in addition to effects on the sympathoadrenal system, regulates NaCl and water metabolism in birds with extrarenal salt glands.", 
    "362": "Atriopeptins are circulating peptide hormones which are secreted by atrial tissue and act at the kidney. Because the atriopeptins survive passage through the pulmonary circulation, they also may be involved in the modulation of airway or pulmonary vascular smooth muscle tone. Using in vitro organ bath techniques, atriopeptins were found to induce potent concentration-dependent relaxation of isolated guinea pig trachea, and pulmonary artery with a rank order of potency: atriopeptin III greater than atriopeptin II greater than atriopeptin I. Atriopeptin-induced smooth muscle relaxation was observed to be a direct response since it was not mediated by activation of relaxant VIP receptors, beta-adrenergic receptors, or H2 receptors nor affected by cyclooxygenase inhibition or denuding of the vasculature or trachea of endothelial and epithelial cells. The time course of atriopeptin II-induced relaxation of the pulmonary artery was transient in contrast to the prolonged relaxations on the trachea. The transient relaxant responses of atriopeptin II on pulmonary artery were not due to metabolism of atriopeptin II to atriopeptin I by angiotensin-converting enzyme since pretreatment with captopril did not augment the response. These results seem to indicate that distinct atriopeptin receptors may exist in airway and pulmonary arterial smooth muscle and that activation of these relaxant receptors may play an important role in the regulation of pulmonary vascular and bronchomotor tone.", 
    "363": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (EC 3.4.15.1) exhibits distinctive tissue differences in electrophoretic behaviour. Human tissue homogenates and biological fluids were subjected to agar gel and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gels were cut into slices and enzymatic activity detected by a specific colorimetric reaction. The technique allows localization of the enzyme in the electrophoretogram and gives an estimate of the total enzymatic activity of a tissue or biological fluid. Several tissues were found to show multiple forms of angiotensin-converting enzyme. The specificity of the assay was determined by running the samples after the addition of captopril and by adding proteinase inhibitors to the incubation mixture.", 
    "364": "The clinical pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of enalapril and its de-esterified active metabolite, MK 422, were determined in eight patients with congestive cardiomyopathy and five patients with hypertension. After administration of single doses of 2.5, 5, and 10 mg enalapril in the congestive heart failure patients and 20 or 40 mg in the hypertensive patients, serum levels and urine elimination of enalapril and MK 422 were determined. Standing and supine heart rate and blood pressure were measured as was ejection fraction in the congestive heart failure group and renin activity, aldosterone levels, and converting enzyme activity in the hypertensive group. Apparent oral clearance after administration of 5 and 10 mg enalapril was lower in the congestive heart failure patients (0.6 +/- 0.2 and 0.7 +/- 0.4 L/min) than after 20 and 40 mg given to hypertensive patients (2.5 +/- 1.3 and 2.7 +/- 2.7 L/min). The elimination of MK 422 was also slower in the congestive heart failure patients (7.8 +/- 5.0 and 6.8 +/- 2.5 h after 5 and 10 mg enalapril, respectively, vs. 4.6 +/- 2.0 and 5.3 +/- 1.1 h after 20 and 40 mg, respectively, in the hypertension group). The enalapril area under the concentration-time curve increased disproportionately to dose increments in both groups, but was more pronounced in congestive heart failure. Twenty and 40 mg enalapril lowered the blood pressure by 2 h after dosing in the hypertension group, and peak effects were seen 4-5 h after dosing. Peak effects correlated with peak serum MK 422 concentrations but not with enalapril (MK 421) levels. Supine heart rates were unchanged after 20 mg, but increased after 40 mg; standing heart rates were transiently increased after 20 and 40 mg enalapril. Blood pressure was not significantly changed in the congestive heart failure group, and cardiac ejection fraction was unchanged. In the hypertension group, renin stimulation and converting enzyme activity inhibition were seen at 4 h and persisted for at least 24 h after administration of 40 mg enalapril. In summary, the clearance of enalapril and elimination of MK 422 was slower in congestive heart failure patients versus hypertensive patients. Therefore, slower onset and longer duration of drug effect might be anticipated in patients with congestive heart failure versus patients with hypertension during enalapril administration.", 
    "365": "The role of the renin-angiotensin system in cardiorenal function in patients with severe chronic congestive heart failure was investigated. A single oral dose of captopril in 16 patients significantly increased cardiac index and reduced arterial blood pressure and total systemic vascular resistance. These changes were significantly greater in subjects with higher baseline plasma renin activity (PRA). During 7-day captopril therapy, renal plasma flow distinctly increased in 10 patients in whom renal function was followed. The increase found in renal plasma flow was greater in subjects with higher PRA. Yet, the reduction in renal vascular resistance was much greater than that of total systemic vascular resistance, even in patients with lower PRA. Simultaneous infusion of aprotinin in eight of these subjects did not affect the captopril-induced increase in renal plasma flow, despite the suppression of plasma bradykinin levels; these responses were the same in both PRA subgroups. The results suggest that captopril reduces total systemic vascular resistance in patients with chronic congestive heart failure through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system and that the preferential renal vasodilator effect of captopril might be the sole result of this inhibition, with the kallikrein-kinin system or kinin-mediated prostaglandins not playing a major role.", 
    "366": "The purpose of this study was to compare the effect of intrarenal angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition with that of systemic ACE inhibition in conscious, instrumented dogs. Intrarenal ACE inhibition was achieved by infusing the potent ACE inhibitor MK-422 into the renal artery in a dose (0.32 micrograms/kg/min) that in dogs fed a normal sodium (n = 11) and low sodium (n = 10) diet markedly attenuated the renal blood flow response to intrarenal arterial angiotensin I (0.4 and 0.8 micrograms, respectively). Intrarenal arterial infusion of MK-422 decreased the responses by 76 and 72% in the normal and low sodium groups, respectively, but only decreased renal vascular resistance slightly (-9 and -8%, respectively) in the infused kidney. Following termination of intrarenal arterial infusion of MK-422, the inhibitor was administered intravenously, 0.2 mg/kg. This dose of MK-422 maximally inhibited systemic ACE, as evidenced by the complete abolition of the renal blood flow response to intravenous angiotensin I; the responses were decreased by 95 and 96% in the normal and low sodium groups, respectively. In contrast to the negligible reduction in renal vascular resistance seen during intrarenal arterial infusion of MK-422, systemically administered inhibitor decreased renal vascular resistance by 16 and 39%, respectively, in the normal and low sodium groups. These results lend additional support to our contention that systemically rather than intrarenally formed angiotensin II is mainly responsible for regulation of renal vascular resistance.", 
    "367": "A peptidase activity of rat diencephalon membranes, which acts on the C-terminal hexapeptide sequence of substance P, was characterized using the radiolabeled substrate N alpha-[( 125I]iododesaminotyrosyl)-substance P (6-11)-hexapeptide. This activity presents certain characteristics similar to those of the substance-P-degrading enzyme purified from human brain by Lee et al. [Eur. J. Biochem. 114, 315-327 (1981)]. It is inhibited by metal chelators and some thiol reagents, but is insensitive to inhibitors of serine proteases and aminopeptidases. The activity is different from angiotensin-converting enzyme and enkephalinase, since it is not affected by specific inhibitors of these enzymes. Substance P and substance P C-terminal fragments longer than the pentapeptide inhibited the degradation of the radiolabeled substrate with inhibition constants around 200 microM. Short fragments of the substance P sequence, such as Boc-Phe-Phe-OMe and Boc-Phe-Phe-Gly-OEt, were also found to inhibit the degradation of the substrate. When the metal-chelating hydroxamic acid moiety was attached to the carboxyl terminus of these short peptides, potent inhibitors of the substance-P-degrading activity were obtained, with inhibition constants in the micromolar range. The most potent of these compounds, iododesaminotyrosyl-Phe-Phe-Gly-NHOH (IBH-Phe-Phe-Gly-NHOH), is a competitive inhibitor, with a Ki value of 1.9 microM. The degradation of substance P by rat diencephalon slices was inhibited to the same extent (40-50%) by IBH-Phe-Phe-Gly-NHOH (20 microM) and by phosphoramidon (1 microM). A combination of both reagents reduced the degradation rate by 75-80%, suggesting that both enkephalinase and the substance-P-degrading activity are involved in the metabolism of substance P in this preparation. IBH-Phe-Phe-Gly-NHOH seems to be quite specific for the latter enzyme, since at a high concentration (0.1 mM) it did not affect the degradation of the radiolabeled substrate by alpha-chymotrypsin, papain, or thermolysin.", 
    "368": "Cells of the N-18 line of mouse neuroblastoma and their membrane degrade substance P added exogenously. The degradation by the cells and their membrane, examined by high-performance liquid chromatography, is strongly inhibited by EDTA but scarcely inhibited by captopril and phosphoramidon. Gly-Leu-Met-NH2 is the major cleavage product among C-terminal fragments of substance P in both cases. Thus, the degradation of substance P by the neuroblastoma cells and their membrane seems to take place mainly through the hydrolysis between Phe8-Gly9 by EDTA-sensitive protease(s).", 
    "369": "Nineteen patients with chronic heart failure participated in a double blind crossover trial of captopril and prazosin--two drugs with differing neuroendocrine effects--to determine whether neuroendocrine changes could explain clinical and haemodynamic responses to treatment. Patients were assessed before and after acute and long term (four weeks') treatment with each drug given in random order. Sixteen patients completed the study. During captopril haemodynamic improvement was maintained by inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. Breathlessness was relieved in 15 patients and exercise capacity increased. During prazosin a reduction in systemic vascular resistance was maintained, but plasma renin activity and aldosterone and noradrenaline concentrations increased, fluid retention developed, and clinical benefit did not occur. These results suggest that clinical and haemodynamic responses to long term vasodilator treatment for chronic heart failure are related to neuroendocrine changes. In patients with chronic heart failure inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system results in clinical benefit, whereas inhibition of the alpha adrenergic system does not.", 
    "370": "Capoten (captopril) treatment was conducted in 39 patients with essential hypertension of stage IIA-IIB and in 4 patients with idiopathic hyperplasia of the adrenals. In 35 patients the hypotensive effect was evaluated following a single administration of captopril in a dose of 12.5, 25 and 50 mg. Twelve patients were treated with this drug alone while in 23 patients it was combined with saluretics. Captopril monotherapy elicited a good and moderate hypotensive effect in 70% of patients with a high and stable hypertension. Both mono- and combined therapy was associated with a decrease in adrenaline and noradrenaline excretion and an increase in uterine kallikrein excretion. The examination of the regional circulation revealed a significant reduction in the resistance and tonus of the arterioles and an enhancement of the blood flow in the forearm as well as an increase in venous tensility. When captopril was combined with diuretics these changes were less marked.",

    "372": "We compared the short-term hemodynamic effects of isosorbide dinitrate (40 mg orally) and captopril (25 mg orally) in 18 patients with severe chronic heart failure in a randomized, crossover study conducted on consecutive days. Captopril and isosorbide dinitrate produced similar decreases in systemic vascular resistance, but whereas nitrate therapy decreased pulmonary arteriolar resistance significantly, captopril did not; the difference between the two drugs was highly significant (-25% vs -5%, p less than 0.001). Left ventricular filling pressures declined similarly with both captopril (-10.5 mm Hg) and with isosorbide dinitrate (-9.3 mm Hg), but because pulmonary arteriolar resistance fell significantly with nitrate therapy, mean right atrial pressure decreased more with isosorbide dinitrate than with captopril (-5.4 vs -2.8 mm Hg, respectively; p less than 0.001). Although systemic resistance declined similarly with both drugs, cardiac index increased more with nitrate therapy than during converting-enzyme inhibition (+0.47 vs +0.23 L/min/m2) (p less than 0.01), and therefore mean arterial pressure fell less with isosorbide dinitrate than with captopril (-10.5 mm Hg vs -16.7 mm Hg); p less than 0.05); two patients developed symptomatic hypotension with captopril, whereas none did so with the nitrate. The difference in the effects of the two drugs on cardiac index was not due to differences in their effects on heart rate, since heart rate fell similarly with both drugs, and thus both drugs produced similar increases in stroke volume index. These data indicate that, in patients with severe chronic heart failure, nitrates exert favorable dilating effects on the pulmonary circulation not shared by captopril.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "373": "The safety and efficacy of captopril therapy in children with severe and refractory hypertension has been evaluated in a collaborative international study which enrolled a group of 73 patients, 15 years of age or younger. Most patients had hypertension associated with renal disease or vascular abnormalities. Captopril was administered for periods of less than 3 months to more than 1 year. A significant decrease in both systolic and diastolic blood pressures was produced by the administration of captopril, usually in conjunction with other antihypertensive agents (most commonly diuretics and/or beta-blockers). Systolic blood pressures were normalized in 62% and 53% and diastolic blood pressures in 56% and 45% of reported patients after the second and sixth months of captopril therapy, respectively. The response to captopril was sustained over a 12-month period. Adverse reactions were reported in 49% of the 73 patients; 48% of patients had experienced adverse reactions to other antihypertensive agents prior to entering the study. The reactions most frequently observed during captopril therapy were hypotension, vomiting, postural symptoms, anemia, rash, and anorexia. Leukopenia was reported in six patients, all of whom had renal impairment. Two of these patients had received concomitant therapy with immunosuppressants, and one had systemic lupus erythematosus. Captopril was discontinued in two of these six children. Statistically significant increases in mean serum urea nitrogen and potassium concentrations and decreases in mean serum CO2 levels were observed during the course of therapy. These effects could not be exclusively attributed to captopril administration as the study population received multidrug therapy and had significant intrinsic disease. Captopril was demonstrated to be an effective and safe drug for the treatment of children with severe hypertension.", 
    "374": "The effects of an orally active inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme (SA-446) on systemic arterial pressure, renal function and renin release were examined in anesthetized dogs. Intrarenal infusion of the larger dose of SA-446 (0.1 mg/min) caused an increase in RBF, urine flow and renin release and caused a fall in blood pressure. The smaller dose of SA-446 (0.02 mg/min) did not affect the blood pressure, but it increased the urine flow. However, the same dose of SA-446 in combination with probenecid caused a significant fall in blood pressure. The potentiation of SA-446 with probenecid may be explained by the elevation in plasma SA-446 concentration via the inhibition of its tubular secretion by probenecid.", 
    "375": "The purpose of the present study was to assess the effect of chronic peripheral sympathectomy in rats on plasma vasopressin (basal and dehydrated) and on pressor sensitivity to vasopressin. Sympathectomy was produced in male Sprague-Dawley rats by daily injection of guanethidine (45 mg/kg) for 9 days. Control rats received saline over the same period. Plasma vasopressin was determined by radio-immunoassay, and pressor sensitivity was determined by monitoring mean arterial pressure response to graded injections of vasopressin (0.1-20 mU) in conscious rats. Sympathectomized rats showed ptosis and supersensitivity to norepinephrine, and had significantly greater basal and dehydrated plasma vasopressin levels than controls (10.3 +/- 1.5 versus 6.2 +/- 0.7, and 12.4 +/- 0.9 versus 8.6 +/- 1.0 pg/ml, s.e.m, respectively, P less than 0.05 for both). Sympathectomized rats also had an increased pressor sensitivity to vasopressin (dose response curve shifted to left, lower threshold, greater slope, P less than 0.001). Injection of a vasopressin pressor-antagonist, d (CH2)5 Me Tyr AVP, had no effect on blood pressure in control rats but caused a significant decrease of blood pressure in sympathectomized rats (15 +/- 1.0 mmHg, P less than 0.001). These results suggest that chronic peripheral sympathectomy in rats is associated with increased basal and dehydrated plasma vasopressin, and increased pressor sensitivity to vasopressin. The effect of the vasopressin antagonist suggests that vasopressin may play a role in blood pressure maintenance in sympathectomized rats.", 
    "376": "The treatment of dilated cardiomyopathy is primarily concerned with that of congestive heart failure. Digitalis is widely use in dilated cardiomyopathy but an improvement in the prognosis has not yet been demonstrated. Furthermore, the effects of digitalis in patients with sinus rhythm are debatable. If dilated cardiomyopathy induces atrial fibrillation and tachyarrhythmia, digitalis should be used. Diuretics are helpful in the treatment of congestive heart failure associated with dilated cardiomyopathy. By reducing hypervolemia and by venous dilatation, diuretics lower preload and afterload. This leads to relief of congestion and termination of the vicious cycle of congestive heart failure. Accordingly, the prognosis of dilated cardiomyopathy might be improved by diuretics. There are numerous diuretics acting differently on the renal tubules, the choice of which depends on the renal function and serum electrolyte concentrations. Reduction of preload and afterload improves congestive heart failure as has been demonstrated repeatedly. Many substances have therefore been used for arterial and venous dilation with differing results. At least for short-term periods, congestion is reduced and cardiac output increases. Especially inhibitors of angiotensin II converting enzyme are very effective since they act both in the arterial and venous systems. Additionally, inhibition of the action of angiotensin may be regarded as causal therapy since the renin-angiotensin system is the trigger for vasoconstriction and fluid retention in congestive heart failure. Unlike other substances, ACE inhibitors have been demonstrated to improve prognosis of patients with congestive heart failure. At present, combined diuretic therapy and angiotensin conversion enzyme inhibition would seem the most reasonable treatment for patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and sinus rhythm. If atrial fibrillation and tachyarrhythmia develop, additional digitalis therapy is effective.", 
    "377": "A new procedure, namely the in situ perfused rat intestine-liver preparation, was introduced to examine the roles of the intestine and the liver in the elimination of enalapril, a new angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. The in situ perfused rat intestine preparation was used to determine the rate and extent of enalapril absorption after an-intraduodenal dose. In the former technique, enalapril in blood perfusate (10 ml/min) was delivered via the superior mesenteric artery into the once-through perfused rat intestine-liver preparation, with sampling effected in reservoir, portal vein and hepatic vein. The ease of sampling, proximal and distal to the intestine and liver, allowed the direct estimation of the extraction ratios by the intestine and the liver. The steady-state intestinal extraction ratio of enalapril was small (0.04 +/- 0.066) compared to that for the liver (0.74 +/- 0.06), indicating that the liver was responsible for most of the hydrolytic conversion of enalapril to its pharmacologically active diacid metabolite, enalaprilat. Moreover, no trend in the values of the extraction ratios by both organs was apparent among the input concentrations of enalapril (0.55, 2.6 and 13.3 microM) used. Portal venous plasma consisted mainly of enalapril and was devoid of enalaprilat, whereas both enalapril and enalaprilat were detected in bile and hepatic venous plasma. With the latter technique, an intraduodenal injection of a tracer dose of [14C]enalapril (0.14-0.39 mumol) was made close to the pyloric sphinctor, whereas the intestine preparation was recirculated (7.5 ml/min) with blank perfusate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "378": "Numerous studies have suggested that a functional relationship exists between the renal kallikrein-kinin and renin-angiotensin systems. We used an in vitro preparation of isolated glomeruli to study the effect of kinins on renin release. Glomeruli were harvested from the dissected cortices of rat kidneys by a passive sieving technique. They were then placed in chambers and superfused with aerated modified Krebs buffer, and the chamber effluent was collected during two sequential 10-min periods. Bradykinin at 10(-6) M increased renin release from 2.17 +/- 0.34 to 4.05 +/- 0.72 ng ANG I/min, and 10(-5) M bradykinin increased renin release from 3.51 +/- 0.64 to 8.94 +/- 1.27 ng ANG I/min. With albumin-modified buffer, 10(-5) M bradykinin stimulated renin release from 7.11 +/- 0.79 to 14.03 +/- 2.36 ng/min. Lys-bradykinin at 10(-5) M also increased renin release from 5.69 +/- 1.11 to 14.50 +/- 2.65 ng ANG I/min. However, neither of the inactive kinin analogues, [Tyr8]bradykinin or des-Arg9-bradykinin, had any effect on renin release. We found that isolated glomeruli were relatively free of kininase activity, in contrast to the high activity found in the kidney slice preparation or in rat plasma. These results suggest that biologically active kinins can stimulate renin release in an in vitro preparation that is free of degradative kininases and independent of hemodynamic and neural influences.", 
    "379": "Using the \"Oxford system\" for ambulatory monitoring of direct arterial blood pressure (BP), the hypotensive effect of enalapril (20 to 40 mg/day), was assessed in 15 patients with essential hypertension. BP was reduced by enalapril throughout the 24 hours of study. A within-patient comparison of corresponding mean hourly systolic and diastolic BP values showed a reduction from (p less than 0.05 to p less than 0.001) for 18 of the 24 hours. Four patients had an increase in BP during treatment with enalapril. There was a significant decrease in systolic BP in response to 60 degrees head-up tilt. During isometric and dynamic exercise there was a smaller increase in systolic BP but a less marked effect on diastolic BP. Heart rate was unaffected either during free ambulation or during physiologic testing. The incidence of side effects was low. These results indicate that enalapril administered once daily may be an effective form of antihypertensive therapy. However, there is a group of patients who are unresponsive to treatment with converting enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "380": "Hypophysectomy of prepubescent (3-week-old) rats prevented the pubertal development of testicular, but not pulmonary, angiotensin-converting enzyme (EC 3.4.15.1). Additionally, hypophysectomy resulted in a loss of testicular converting enzyme activity in 10-week-old rats that had achieved puberty and had developed enzyme activity. Hormone regimens consisting of FSH/LH (7.5 U/rat X day), hCG (10 U/rat X day), or testosterone (1 mg/rat X day) were employed to ascertain their ability to maintain activity in hypophysectomized rats. All three of the above hormone regimens, if initiated on the first day after hypophysectomy of 10-week-old rats, were capable of maintaining testicular converting enzyme activity. Centrifugal elutriation of dispersed testicular cells indicated that the majority of enzyme activity in mature rats was associated with the germinal cells, a result consistent with the data accumulated from the hormonal studies. Lastly, [3H]captopril bound specifically to cellular fractions enriched in germinal cells. The above studies suggest that the pituitary gland is required for the development and maintenance of testicular angiotensin-converting enzyme in the rat by stimulating steroidogenesis in the testes. Furthermore, the sensitivity of converting enzyme activity to androgen coupled with the centrifugal elutriation and [3H] captopril binding studies strongly support the notion that testicular converting enzyme is associated with germinal cells.", 
    "381": "Two groups of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) were treated with captopril and enalapril, respectively. Treatment was started at weaning and at 8 months of age. Blood pressure was maintained close to normal in rats treated from weaning and significantly lowered but not to normal levels in rats started on treatment at 8 months. The long-term treated rats did not show significant cardiac enlargement whereas those treated at 8 months had an increase in cardiac size although not to the same level as untreated animals. Treatment with minoxidil and minoxidil plus propranolol similarly lowers blood pressure, but does not reduce myocardial hypertrophy. The data confirm that both the time of onset of treatment as well as the type of drug influence the myocardial complications of hypertension in SHRs. These studies further demonstrate the use of the SHR as a model for clinical pharmacologic studies with antihypertensive agents.", 
    "382": "By means of specific inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (captopril) and of the sympathetic nervous activity (prazosin) in dogs with congestive heart failure, and by using a specific antagonist of the pressor activity of arginine vasopressin in rats with heart failure, we studied the influence of these pressor hormone systems on peripheral vascular resistance and cardiac function. All three humoral vasoconstrictor systems were stimulated in heart failure. The experiments in dogs showed that the renin-angiotensin system plays an important role in the pathogenesis of heart failure by increasing peripheral vascular tone, thus impairing cardiac function, a mechanism which could be nearly completely prevented by converting enzyme inhibition. The increased sympathetic nervous activity was only insignificantly attenuated by the converting enzyme inhibition and its contribution to the increase of peripheral vascular resistance was only small and transient. The rats with heart failure showed no effect on the vasopressin inhibitor on peripheral vascular resistance and cardiac function, despite plasma vasopressin levels which were 4 to 5 times higher than those in control animals. The inappropriately high secretion of vasopressin in relation to a decreased plasma osmolality may have contributed to the formation of edema and to the development of 'dilutional hypoosmolality'.", 
    "383": "The 56-kilodalton (56K) protease isolated from a culture filtrate of Serratia marcescens caused vascular permeability enhancement followed by edema formation when injected into guinea pig peripheral corneas and subconjunctival space or skin. The character and the mechanism of permeability enhancement were analyzed in vivo. The enhancement was maximum at 5 to 10 min. The permeability reaction increased exponentially by the amount of enzyme used. The enhancement of permeability induced by the 56K protease was not affected by treatment with an antihistamine but was greatly augmented by simultaneous injection of a kinin potentiator, Glu-Trp-Pro-Arg-Pro-Gln-Ile-Pro-Pro-OH (SQ 20,881). Furthermore, the permeability activity of the protease, but not the amidolytic activity, was inhibited by soybean trypsin inhibitor, a well-known inhibitor of plasma kallikrein, as well as by corn trypsin inhibitor, the best inhibitor of activated Hageman factor. Results of these in vivo studies indicate that the permeability-enhancing reaction induced by the 56K protease is caused by activation of the Hageman factor-dependent pathway in the tissue. The permeability-increasing activity of the 56K protease was parallel with the enzyme activity. Serratial lipopolysaccharide did not produce a permeability enhancement reaction within 30 min when injected into guinea pig skin. These results are consistent with the results of recent in vitro experiments in which activation of the purified Hageman factor but not of prekallikrein by the 56K protease was elucidated (Matsumoto et al., J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 96:739-749, 1984). Thus, the molecular mechanism described above appears to be operative in the pathogenesis of corneal edema and chemosis, which is induced by S. marcescens, in addition to the direct tissue destruction by the protease.", 
    "384": "1. In patients with congestive heart failure, both the sympathetic nervous system and renin-angiotensin system are often stimulated. In order to assess the contribution of the renin-angiotensin system to limb vascular resistance, the forearm haemodynamic response to captopril was studied in 13 patients with heart failure. 2. Seven subjects were studied while supine and during 60 degrees head-up tilt. To eliminate alpha-adrenergic effects, six additional patients with heart failure were pretreated with intra-arterial phentolamine and then given captopril. Venous occlusion plethysmography was used to determine forearm blood flow and forearm vascular resistance. 3. Tilt did not significantly increase pretreatment plasma renin activity or plasma noradrenaline concentration, nor did it decrease forearm blood flow. Furthermore, captopril did not alter forearm vascular resistance during supine or upright posture. During the phentolamine infusion, however, captopril reduced forearm vascular resistance by 19% (P < 0.05). 4. Despite increased plasma renin activity, captopril did not cause forearm vasodilatation during supine or upright posture in these patients with heart failure. When the contribution of the sympathetic nervous system was eliminated, captopril decreased forearm vascular resistance. Therefore, in patients with congestive heart failure, the sympathetic nervous system is important in limb vasoregulation, and the contribution of the renin-angiotensin system is apparent only after alpha-adrenergic blockade.", 
    "385": "1. Plasma volumes and cardiovascular status were assessed in rats with a congenital deficiency in hypothalamic vasopressin (Brattleboro strain) and in the parent strain (Long Evans), in water-replete and water-deprived states. 2. Water-replete Brattleboro rats were not hypovolaemic; water deprivation (14 h in Brattleboro rats, 53 h in Long Evans rats) produced similar percentage reductions in plasma volumes in the two groups. 3. In the water-replete state, cardiovascular variables were similar in Long Evans and Brattleboro rats. Inhibition of ganglionic transmission (with pentolinium) or of the renin-angiotensin system (with captopril), separately, did not have a greater effect on blood pressure in Brattleboro rats than in Long Evans rats. Recovery from hypotension caused by pentolinium was characterized by large swings in blood pressure in both groups of rats. These pressor episodes were abolished by administration of captopril to Brattleboro rats. After administration of pentolinium and captopril to Long Evans rats there was a substantial, although intermittent, recovery in blood pressure that was abolished by an antagonist of the cardiovascular actions of vasopressin. 4. In the water-deprived state, blood pressures were similar in Long Evans and Brattleboro rats; both groups showed an elevation in diastolic blood pressure relative to the water-replete state. After administration of pentolinium, there was a more marked recovery in blood pressure than was seen in the water-replete state. Administration of captopril alone had a slightly greater effect on blood pressure in Long Evans rats in the water-deprived, compared with the water-replete, state. However, in the former condition, Brattleboro rats showed a profound and progressive hypotension in response to captopril, indicating an indispensable role for the renin-angiotensin system in the maintenance of blood pressure in these animals during water deprivation. 5. Only when the renin-angiotensin system and neural activity were inhibited did vasopressin express its full, independent, pressor potential in Long Evans rats. However, evidence was obtained that vasopressin may exert important effects on cardiovascular regulation via neural mechanisms and through interactions with the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "386": "1. Eight patients with essential hypertension were challenged with an infusion of 32 mmol of potassium chloride in saline before and after control of their blood pressure by the angiotensin converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril. 2. The potassium infusion was associated with similar increases in plasma aldosterone before and during enalapril treatment, although absolute aldosterone levels were lower after enalapril treatment despite higher plasma potassium levels. 3. The handling of the potassium load was altered by ACE inhibition. The area under the curve of a plot of the increase in plasma potassium above baseline against time was greater during enalapril treatment than during treatment with placebo. 4. These observations contrast with data obtained in the dog and demonstrate that in patients with essential hypertension stimulation of aldosterone secretion by potassium is not abolished by chronic suppression of plasma angiotensin II; and although plasma aldosterone remains at a lower level, the homoeostasis of plasma potassium is only mildly impaired.", 
    "387": "The acute antihypertensive effect of a new long-acting oral angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, enalapril maleate, was assessed in 20 hypertensive patients, of whom 14 had essential hypertension, 4 had renovascular hypertension, one had hypertension associated with chronic renal failure, and one had primary aldosteronism. Enalapril maleate significantly lowered the blood pressure in either low-renin or normal- and high-renin hypertensives. There was a significant correlation for all patients as a group between the pretreatment levels of serum ACE activity and the reduction in mean blood pressure (r = -0.454, p less than 0.05, n = 20) 2 h after drug administration. The serum ACE activity decreased maximally 3 to 4 hours after drug administration and did not return to baseline levels within 24 h. There was a significant correlation between the reduction in mean blood pressure and changes in ACE activity 90 min and 2 h after drug administration, respectively, for all patients as a group (r = 0.495, p less than 0.05, n = 20, at 90 min; r = 0.508, p less than 0.05, n = 20, at 2 h). The plasma renin activity (PRA) significantly increased in normal- and high-renin hypertensives but not in low-renin hypertensives. There was a close correlation between the reduction in mean blood pressure and the PRA 8 h after drug administration in normal- and high-renin patients (r = -0.623, p less than 0.05, n = 13), while no such relationship was observed in low-renin patients. The plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) significantly decreased within 3 h, the lowest values occurring at 8 h after drug administration, and it returned to baseline levels within 24 h in all patients. No relationship was found between the reduction in mean blood pressure and changes in PAC after drug administration in either low-renin or normal- and high-renin hypertensives. The plasma bradykinin concentration (PBC) increased within 1 h, the highest values occurring at 3 h after drug administration, and returned to baseline levels within 24 h in low-renin hypertensives, while the PBC was significantly increased at 4 h and had not returned to baseline levels within 24 h in normal- and high-renin hypertensives. There was a significant correlation between percentage changes in mean blood pressure and those in PBC 90 min after drug administration in normal- and high-renin hypertensives (r = -0.556, p less than 0.05, n = 13), while no relationship was observed between them in low-renin hypertensives.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "388": "Dilated cardiomyopathy is a primary myocardial disease of unknown origin. The typical findings are severe systolic pump failure and dilatation of all cardiac chambers with severe cardiomegaly. Clinical symptomatology is determined by myocardial dysfunction with congestive heart failure. Cardiomegaly and arrhythmia may precede clinical symptoms of congestive heart failure by years. Medical therapy is based on classical treatment of congestive heart failure with digitalis and diuretics; recently, afterload-reducing agents, such as converting enzyme inhibitors, have become the drug of choice for patients with severe congestive heart failure. Antiarrhythmic therapy is necessary in the presence of severe arrhythmia, and anticoagulation is indicated when a low-output state or atrial fibrillation are present. Clinical course in dilated cardiomyopathy is usually poor and 5-year survival is 38% in our group.", 
    "389": "The effect of various therapeutic procedures (surgery, percutaneous transluminal dilatation and antihypertensive drugs) was analyzed in 161 patients with renovascular hypertension. The results show that each of the three methods effectively lowers blood pressure. However, marked differences in pretreatment clinical and laboratory data among the three groups were observed, which were most probably caused by different selection criteria before submitting the patient to a given therapeutic regime. The findings also demonstrate that, on the basis of the present analysis, a direct comparison between surgery, dilatation and medical therapy is not possible."
