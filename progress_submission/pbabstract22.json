Post hoc analysis of the Survival of Myocardial Infarction Long-Term Evaluation study, a double-blind, clinical trial including 1400 patients with anterior myocardial infarction, randomized to zofenopril (n = 699, 66% hypercholesterolemics) or placebo (n = 701, 64% hypercholesterolemics) for 6 weeks. The rate of the primary end-point (6-week combined occurrence of death and severe congestive heart failure) was 8.1% in hypercholesterolemic and 6.4% in normocholesterolemic patients (P < 0.03). The favourable effect of treatment with zofenopril was enhanced in hypercholesterolemics patients when compared with normocholesterolemics (RRR = 43%, P = 0.034 vs. 25%, P = 0.19). One-year mortality was 10% in hypercholesterolemic patients vs. 7.5% in normocholesterolemic patients (P = 0.037), equally reduced in both hypercholesterolemic and normocholesterolemics patients by zofenopril. The presence of hypercholesterolaemia in patients with anterior myocardial infarction could be associated with more favourable effects of early ACE-inhibition.", 
    "1": "We examined 50 patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) who in dependence on prescription in the content of basic therapy of sulfhydric group containing angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) zofenopril and captopril were divided into 2 groups each comprizing 25 patients. We studied dynamics of lipid peroxidation, protective antioxidant systems, the state of endothelial function, systemic inflammation, and endogenous cytoprotective mechanisms - the system of nitric oxide (NO) and stress proteins of HSP70 family - during fist 24 hours of hospitalization, in 1 and 6 months after development of MI. We have found that long-term administration of ACEI promotes lowering of free radical oxidation products what is related to activation of protective antioxidant enzymes and total antioxidant activity of blood serum. Preparations also exert positive effect on the state of protective HSP70 system and parameters of endothelial function.", 
    "2": "According to current definition, peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is a rare disorder in which left ventricular dysfunction and symptoms of heart failure occur in the last month of pregnancy. It has been reported that the incidence of PPCM is 1 in 3,000-4,000 live births. The pathogenesis is poorly understood, however, infectious, immunologic, and nutritional causes have been hypothesized. Clinical presentation includes usual signs and symptoms of heart failure, and unusual presentations such as thromboembolism. Diagnosis is based upon the clinical presentation of congestive heart failure and the objective evidence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Early diagnosis and initiation of treatment are essential to optimize pregnancy outcome. Patients with systolic dysfunction during pregnancy are treated similar to patients who are not pregnant. The mainstays of medical therapy are digoxin, loop diuretics, sodium restriction and afterload reducing agents (hydralazine and nitrates). Due to a high risk for venous and arterial thrombosis, anticoagulation with subcutaneous heparin should be instituted. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers should be avoided during pregnancy because of severe adverse neonatal effects. Effective treatment reduces mortality rates and increases the number of women who fully recover left ventricular systolic function. The prognosis is poor in patients with persistent cardiomyopathy. Subsequent pregnancies are often associated with recurrence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction.", 
    "3": "Several cellular and molecular mechanisms have been implicated in migraine pathophysiology including abnormal neuronal excitability and vascular events. Drugs from different pharmacological classes are used for migraine prophylaxis. These agents may normalize neuronal excitability by modulating distinct ionic channels and various neurotransmitter systems. They can also block cortical spreading depression, prevent peripheral and/or central pain sensitization, and normalize brainstem function. Most of the drugs recently used in migraine prophylaxis have been identified by serendipidy and they have been originally approved for other indications. Subsequently, their use has been extended to migraine prevention, according to their putative mechanisms of action. More recently, trials on adequate samples of migraine patients have been conducted for several drugs. In the present review, we will present and discuss the pathophysiological bases for the use of antidepressants, beta-adrenergic blockers, calcium channel blockers and antiepileptic drugs in migraine prevention. Currently, the major classes of conventional migraine preventive drugs include the antidepressant amitriptyline, the beta-adrenergic blocker propranolol, and the antiepileptic drugs topiramate and valproic acid. Promising results have recently been obtained for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers. Some limited clinical findings have also been reported for atypical antipsychotic agents, nutritional supplements and also botulinum toxin. Targets of migraine preventive treatment are to reduce frequency and intensity of attacks and to decrease disability related to chronic headache.", 
    "4": "Melatonin was shown to reduce blood pressure, oxidative load and to increase nitric oxide bioavailability predisposing melatonin to have antiremodelling potential.", 
    "5": "The aim of this study was to show whether melatonin can reverse left ventricular remodelling in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and to compare this potential protective effect with captopril, spironolactone, or simvastatin.", 
    "6": "Six groups of 3-month old rats (eight per group) were treated for 5 weeks: control untreated Wistar rats, control SHR, SHR plus melatonin (10 mg/kg per 24 h), SHR plus captopril (100 mg/kg per 24 h), SHR plus spironolactone (200 mg/kg per 24 h) and SHR plus simvastatin (10 mg/kg per 24 h). Their systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured by the tail-cuff method. The relative weights of the left ventricle, nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity, endothelial NOS and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) protein expression, conjugated dienes concentration, level of collagenous proteins and hydroxyproline were measured.", 
    "7": "SBP was reduced by all drugs investigated but most prominently by captopril in SHR. The activity of NOS and endothelial NOS expression increased in the left ventricles of SHR compared with controls. Melatonin and spironolactone further increased NOS expression. Left ventricular oxidative load, estimated by NF-kappaB expression and conjugated dienes concentration, increased in SHR. Only melatonin reduced NF-kappaB expression and decreased conjugated diens concentration. Only captopril reduced left ventricular hypertrophy in SHR, whereas melatonin reduced collagenous protein concentration and hydroxyproline content in the left ventricle.", 
    "8": "It is concluded that although melatonin, in comparison with captopril, did not reverse left ventricle hypertrophy, it reversed left ventricular fibrosis. This protection by melatonin may be caused by its prominent antioxidative effect.", 
    "9": "The effects of indapamide, a thiazide-like diuretic, and captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, on spontaneous hypertension and the development of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), nitric oxide generation and oxidant status were investigated.", 
    "10": "Six-week-old male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were treated with indapamide (1 mg/kg per day) or captopril (10 mg/kg per day) or a combination of indapamide plus captopril. After the 6-week treatment, nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity, the expression of NOS isoform proteins, conjugated dienes concentration and relaxation responses of the femoral artery were analyzed.", 
    "11": "Indapamide and captopril partly prevented a blood pressure increase in young SHR. Captopril in contrast to indapamide reduced LVH. The effect of the combined indapamide and captopril treatment on the prevention of hypertension was additive. Combined indapamide and captopril treatment increased NOS activity and endothelial NOS protein expression in the aorta and decreased conjugated dienes concentration in the kidney compared with the indapamide monotherapy group. Indapamide and indapamide and captopril treatment increased acetylcholine-induced relaxation of the femoral artery.", 
    "12": "Whereas captopril reduced LVH, indapamide enhanced NOS activity and decreased oxidative damage in the case of the combined treatment. It is concluded that the complex protective effects of the combined indapamide plus captopril treatment on hypertension may be exerted via its effects on blood pressure, hypertrophy and vasorelaxation.", 
    "13": "This brief review discusses pharmacological management of hypertension in very elderly patients, a very powerful and rapidly growing subpopulation of patients. It is well known that age is the most powerful risk factor for death, cardiovascular death and hypertension. Blood pressure reduction is effective in preventing major vascular events including stroke and heart failure. However, earlier trials were inconclusive as to whether treatment of this age group is beneficial. One of these trials, subgroup meta-analysis (1999) which enrolled 1,670 patients in seven clinical trials, showed a 36% lower risk of stroke and a 39% lower risk of heart failure, but slightly increased all-cause mortality. More recently, however, data coming from the Hypertension In the Very Elderly Trial (HYVET) has resolved the clinical uncertainty about the relative benefits and risks of antihypertensive treatment in patients over 80 years old. HYVET studied a relatively healthy 3,845 patients, who were assigned to indapamide +/- perindopril vs. placebo +/- placebo. There was a significant reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. What was unexpected was that overall mortality reduced as well in actively treated individuals. No specific guidelines exist for hypertension management for this particular population. Data from clinical trials including HYVET favor thiazide diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium channel blockers for either mono-therapy or combination therapy for hypertension in the elderly.",

The aim of the study was to describe cardioprotective medication prescription patterns in incident HD patients with left ventricular dysfunction (LVDys) and patients' post-acute coronary syndrome.", 
    "15": "Incident HD patients between January 2002 and December 2004 were included and followed until 2007 or death. Data extraction was retrospective by means of electronic chart review and from a local dialysis database.", 
    "16": "A total of 272 patients were included for analysis; 104 of them (38%) had LVDys. Patients with severe LVDys (EF < 40%) were more likely to be prescribed angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (55.8 vs. 39.1%, P = 0.051), beta-blockers (81.4 vs. 62.4%, P = 0.018), statins (60.5 vs 38.3%, P = 0.009), ASA (37.2 vs 21%, P = 0.27) and clopidogrel (16.3 vs. 3%, P = 0.001). Sixty-five (24%) suffered an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and were prescribed ACE inhibitors (57 vs. 38%, P = 0.006), beta-blockers (85 vs. 59%, P = NS), short-acting nitrates (14.0 vs. 2.0%, P < 0.0001), statin (65 vs. 36%, P < 0.0001), clopidogrel (25 vs. 2%, P < 0.0001) and ASA (60 vs. 18%, P < 0.0001). Using multiple logistic regression, LVDys was associated with mortality (OR 1.79, CI 100-3.21, P = 0.05), beta-blockers conferred a mortality benefit (OR 0.50, CI 0.27-0.93, P < 0.0001) and ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, statins and clopidogrel were not statistically significant.", 
    "17": "Hemodialysis patients with LVDys and ACS were commonly prescribed cardiac medications despite the poor level of direct evidence.

Electronic databases were searched until and including January 2008 for any candidate gene investigated in VTE. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were determined for each gene disease association using fixed and random effect models. Our meta-analyses included approximately 126,525 cases and 184,068 controls derived from 173 case-control studies, which included 21 genes (28 polymorphisms). Statistically significant associations with VTE were identified for factor V G1691A (OR 9.45; 95% CI 6.72-13.30, p < 0.0001), factor V A4070G (OR 1.24; 95% CI 1.02-1.52, p = 0.03), prothrombin G20210A, (OR 3.17; 95% CI 2.19-3.46, p < 0.00001), prothrombin G11991A, (OR 1.17; 95% CI 1.07-1.27, p = 0.0007), PAI-1 4G/5G, (OR 1.62; 95% CI 1.22-2.16, p = 0.0008), alpha-fibrinogen Thr312Ala (OR 1.37; 95% CI 1.14-1.64, p = 0.0008), all in Caucasian populations.

    "19": "Acute myocardial infarction is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the adult population of developed and developing nations. Although the prompt restoration of antegrade blood flow in the infarct-related coronary artery is the mean therapy for improving survival, reperfusion itself may cause damage to ischaemic myocardial tissue. This event is well known as \"reperfusion injury\". Crucial mediators for cardiac damage in the reperfusion phases are oxidative stress, inflammation and leukocyte infiltration. Already approved and novel therapies might directly reduce these inflammatory processes. Treatments modulating chemokine secretion and activity should be considered as very promising approaches to reduce myocardial reperfusion injury.", 
    "20": "Lithium carbonate is used to treat depressive episodes in patients with manic depressive disorder. Lithium toxicity is closely related to serum levels of lithium, and can occur with doses of lithium carbonate close to those used in therapy. Herein we report a case in which pharmaceutical intervention led to a patient's early recovery. The patient was hospitalized with a complaint of dyspnea, and clinical findings revealed signs of bradyarrhythmia. We investigated the medications the patient brought with him and the record of his prescribed medications in his drug notebook. From this we found that he had been taking imidapril (an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) in addition to lithium carbonate, and surmised that lithium toxicity may have occurred from the drug interactions between the lithium carbonate and imidapril in this patient. To prevent the level of toxicity from advancing, we proposed to the physician in charge that the patient's serum lithium levels be measured immediately and that all drugs be discontinued. By receiving care centered on detoxification, the patient avoided measures such as placement of a permanent pacemaker and thereby made a quick recovery from a dangerous state. This is a good example of a case in which pharmaceutical intervention improved the patient's quality of life (QOL) and contributed to conserving limited medical resources. As shown by this case, regular checks of patients' current medications and drug notebooks at the time of hospitalization are an effective means of implementing pharmaceutical interventions that can contribute to medical care.", 
    "21": "Angiotensin II may be involved in pancreatic disorganization, but the involvement of chymase has been unclear. In the present study, we examined whether chymase is involved in pancreatic disorganization in hamsters with streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes. Hamsters were injected with streptozotocin (60 mg/kg), and non-injected hamsters served as controls. To investigate the effect of a chymase inhibitor, TY-51469 (30 mg/kg per day), hamsters in the STZ group were administered TY-51469 or placebo from 2 weeks after STZ injection, for 1 week. A significant increase in blood glucose level was observed at 1 week after STZ injection. This was maintained at 2 weeks, and a further significant increase was observed at 3 weeks. Until 2 weeks after STZ injection, all angiotensin II-related enzyme activities were unchanged, but at 3 weeks pancreatic chymase and total angiotensin II-forming activities, but not angiotensin-converting enzyme activity, were significantly increased. TY-51469 significantly attenuated blood glucose level along with reductions of chymase and total angiotensin II-forming activities and malondialdehyde level. Furthermore, there were significantly more pancreatic islets in the TY-51469 group than in the placebo group. In conclusion, chymase inhibition might protect against pancreatic islet disorganization.",

A total of 143 999 patients enrolled at 438 sites between January 2000 and January 2008 were classified according to the absence (n=98 136; 68%) or presence of known preexistent atherosclerosis (before admission) in 1, 2, or 3 vascular territories (n=37 633 [26%], n=7369 [5%], and n=861 [0.6%], respectively). Overall in-hospital mortality was 5.3%, and mean length of stay was 5.6+/-6.7 days. Compared with patients without prior vascular disease, patients with prior vascular disease were older and had more comorbidities. They were less likely to undergo coronary revascularization and had longer duration of hospital stay and higher in-hospital mortality. After adjustment for clinical and hospital characteristics, compared with patients without prior vascular disease, patients with prior vascular disease had higher mortality and were less likely to receive 3 particular treatments (lipid-lowering therapy, smoking cessation counseling, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor for left ventricular dysfunction).",

Annual event rates and risks of major macrovascular and microvascular events considered jointly and separately, renal events, and death during an average 4.3 years of follow-up were assessed, using Cox proportional hazards models.", 
    "27": "There was no interaction between the effects of routine blood pressure lowering and intensive glucose control for any of the prespecified clinical outcomes (all P > 0.1): the separate effects of the two interventions for the renal outcomes and death appeared to be additive on the log scale. Compared with neither intervention, combination treatment reduced the risk of new or worsening nephropathy by 33% (95% CI 12-50%, P = 0.005), new onset of macroalbuminuria by 54% (35-68%, P < 0.0001), and new onset of microalbuminuria by 26% (17-34%). Combination treatment was associated with an 18% reduction in the risk of all-cause death (1-32%, P = 0.04).",

This yeast-lactobacillus association is GRAS. Two novel lactokinins were identified: NYW and W with IC50 of 20 and 0.86 mum respectively. They both were resistant toward simulated gastrointestinal digestion. In addition, WLAHK was found in the hydrolysate. These three sequences belong to f(99-110) of alpha-la which seems to be a lactokinin cryptic zone. W was the major molecule released by the fermentation process. Considering that W is the precursor of serotonin, the hydrolysate produced could be of interest for the generation of functional health ingredient involved in regulation of affective disorders and hypertension.",

The first two patients aged > or = 18 years consulting their GP on each day were asked to participate, irrespective of the reason for the consultation. After informed consent was obtained, a questionnaire was used to collect sociodemographic, clinical and laboratory data. Two blood pressure (BP) measurements were taken after a 5-minute rest period in a seated position. HT was defined as BP higher than 140/90 mmHg or use of antihypertensive medication.", 
    "33": "A total of 16,856 subjects were evaluated (mean age 58.1 +/- 15.1 years; 61.3% women). The prevalence of HT adjusted for age and gender was 42.62% (males: 43.09%, females: 42.19%). Of the 9,189 hypertensive patients under treatment, the proportion receiving one, two or three or more drug classes was 47.62%, 36.16% and 16.22% respectively. The classes most frequently used in monotherapy were angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs, 16.9%), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs, 14.41%) and diuretics (5.85%).

The most frequently used AHT drugs were diuretics (47.4%), ARBs (43%) and ACEIs (39.2%). CCBs were used in 18.9% and beta-blockers in 16.2% only. Different patterns of treatment were identified according to gender, age and region of residence. Diuretics were used more in the elderly, women, and in the Azores (61.9%) and the Alentejo (58.3%). ARBs were used preferentially in middle-aged patients, men and in the Northern region (48.6%).", 
    "34": "There is considerable regional variation in treatment patterns. The proportion of hypertensive patients under monotherapy is still very high. Increasing the use of combination antihypertensive therapy would probably improve HT control in the population.

These parameters include volume of extracellular water, inflammatory state, metrical age, duration of treatment with PD, metabolic acidosis, treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Among laboratory parameters, which are related to excess of visceral fat tissue, the most important results of investigations on serum adipocytokine concentration and insulin resistance are presented, underlying their associations with anthropometric parameters of nutritional state of PD patients.",

The importance of good control of blood glucose and blood pressure remain key elements in the prevention and treatment of diabetic retinopathy, and a number of specific metabolic pathways have been identified that may be useful additional targets for therapeutic intervention. Trial data, however, aimed specifically to answer the questions of optimum medical management are limited, so the DIRECT study of renin-angiotensin blockade using oral candesartan 32 mg daily is a welcome addition to our knowledge. This arose from the promising improvement of retinopathy outcomes in the EUCLID study of lisinopril in type I diabetes. In DIRECT, 5 years of candesartan treatment in type I diabetes reduced the incidence of retinopathy by two or more steps (EDTRS) in severity by 18% (P=0.0508) and, in a post hoc analysis, reduced the incidence of retinopathy by three-step progression by 35% (P=0.034). In type I diabetes patients there was no effect on progression of established retinopathy. In contrast, in type II diabetes, 5 years of candesartan treatment resulted in 34% regression of retinopathy (P=0.009). Importantly, an overall significant change towards less-severe retinopathy was noted in both type I and II diabetes (P<or=0.03). Although there is still no absolute proof that these effects were specific to RAS blockade, or just an effect of lower blood pressure, it is reasonable to conclude that candesartan has earned a place in the medical management of diabetic retinopathy, to prevent the problem in type I diabetes and to treat the early stages in type II diabetes.",

However, their potential as a source of bioactive peptides has not been explored. The present study is aimed at characterizing and evaluating the activity of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor of the amaranth protein concentrate and of hydrolysates produced with Alcalase. The protein concentrate, after simulated gastrointestinal digestion, showed lower angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory activity (IC(50) of 0.439 +/- 0.018 mg protein/mL and 0.475 +/- 0.021 mg protein/mL, for untreated and heat treated protein concentrate, respectively) than the hydrolysates produced with Alcalase, before and after simulated gastrointestinal digestion (IC(50) 0.118 +/- 0.009, 0.123 +/- 0.007, 0.137 +/- 0.002, and 0.176 +/- 0.014 mg protein/mL, respectively). The simulated gastrointestinal digestion (pepsin-pancreatin) did not significantly alter the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibiting activity of the Alcalase hydrolysates, suggesting that the peptides of the hydrolysates were resistant to gastrointestinal hydrolysis.

Extemporaneously compounded, 0.1 mg/mL and 1.0 mg/mL, oral suspensions of enalapril maleate in sugar-containing and sugar-free vehicles were stored in the absence of light at 4 degrees and 25 degrees C for 30 days. Enalapril maleate stability was quantified after 7, 14, 21, and 30 days using HPLC method. Viscosities and pH of prepared suspensions were measured on each study day and no appreciable changes from the initial pH and initial viscosities occurred in any of the samples both at 25 degrees and 4 degrees C. It was shown that all the formulations retain minimum 98% of the initial enalapril maleate concentration after 30 days of storage at 25 degrees and 4 degrees C and they may provide an option in situations where the marketed suspension is unavailable.", 
    "49": "A 55-years-old woman, with a history of hypertension and ischemic stroke with residual left hemiparesis, was admitted to our hospital because of dyspnoea with clinical evidence of acute pulmonary edema. She was found to have a sinus tachycardia with ST-elevation in leads D1, aVL and V1-V4 in the electrocardiogram, and akinesis of the left ventricular apex with overall left ventricular systolic function being severely impaired and an ejection fraction of 28% on echocardiography. Orotracheal intubation was performed and mechanical ventilation was immediately started. Emergency cardiac catheterization was performed 2 h after the symptom onset. Coronary angiography showed no significant coronary artery disease. Blood analysis revealed an increase in the creatine kinase MB fraction, a significant positive detection in troponin T, a white blood cell count of 35000 per microliter, C-reactive protein of 59,9 mg/dl, and transient elevation in the concentration of free triiodothyronine, free thyroxine, thyroid globulin antibody, and thyroid peroxidase antibody. The symptoms improved during the next days, and follow-up echocardiography 18 days later showed complete resolution of the left ventricular dysfunction. These data suggest that tako-tsubo cardiomyopathy may be induced in patients with sepsis and transient hyperthyroidism.", 
    "50": "The prevention of symptomatic heart failure represents the treatment of patients in the A and B stages of AHA/ACC heart failure classification. Stage A refers to patients without structural heart disease but at risk to develop chronic heart failure. The major risk factors in stage A are hypertension, diabetes, atherosclerosis, family history of coronary artery disease and history of cardiotoxic drug use. In this stage, blockers hypertension is the primary area in which beta blockers may be useful. Beta blockers seem not to be superior to other medication in reducing the development of heart failure due to hypertension. Stage B heart failure refers to structural heart disease but without symptoms of heart failure. This includes patients with asymptomatic valvular disease, asymptomatic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, previous myocardial infarction with or without LV dysfunction. In asymptomatic valvular disease no data are available on the efficacy of beta blockers to prevent heart failure. In asymptomatic LV dysfunction only few asymptomatic patients have been enrolled in the trials which tested beta blockers. NYHA I patients were barely 228 in the MDC, MERIT and ANZ trials altogether. The REVERT trial was the only trial focusing on NYHA I patients with LV ejection fraction less than 40%. Metoprolol extended release on top of ACE inhibitors ameliorated LV systolic volume and ejection fraction. A post hoc analysis of the SOLVD Prevention trial demonstrated that beta blockers reduced death and development of heart failure. Similar results were reported in post MI patients in a post hoc analysis of the SAVE trial (Asymptomatic LV failure post myocardial infarction). In the CAPRICORN trial about 65% of the patients were not taking diuretics and then could be considered asymptomatic. The study revealed a reduction in mortality and a non-significant trend toward reduction of death and hospital admission for heart failure.",

    "52": "We investigated the effects of a high-fat (HF) diet and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-alpha activation on the intrarenal lipotoxicity associated with the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and oxidative stress using spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) rats. Male SHR and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats at 8 weeks of age were fed either a normal-fat diet or an HF diet without or with fenofibrate treatment for 12 weeks. Severe intrarenal lipid accumulation was noted in the SHR rats fed an HF diet than in WYK rats fed an HF diet (P<0.05). This lipid accumulation was associated with a 70% decrease in renal PPARalpha expression in SHR rats, whereas an HF diet increased the expression of PPARalpha in WKY rats by threefold. An HF diet also activated intrarenal, not systemic, RAS and induced oxidative stress associated with reduced nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability. By contrast, fenofibrate attenuated weight gain, fat mass and insulin resistance. Fenofibrate recovered HF diet-induced decreases in intrarenal PPARalpha expression and fat accumulation, and abolished intrarenal RAS activation and oxidative stress in SHR-HF animals (P<0.01). These activities conferred protection against increased blood pressure (BP), glomerulosclerosis and renal inflammation. Intrarenal free fatty acid and triglyceride concentrations were positively correlated with angiotensin II (gamma=0.63, 0.36) and 24-h urinary 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine (gamma=0.36, 0.39), and negatively correlated with PPARalpha contents (gamma=-0.47, -0.44; P<0.05). An HF diet-induced lipotoxicity by depletion of intrarenal PPARalpha aggravated BP and renal inflammation as a result of intrarenal RAS activation and oxidative stress. Therefore, intervention with PPARalpha activators can effectively prevent diet-induced renal lipotoxicity in hypertensive rats.",

Women are less likely to have coronary artery disease and more likely than men to have hypertension and valvular disease as the underlying etiology. They often present at an older age with better systolic function than men. For both sexes, there is significant morbidity, but age-adjusted data reveal that women have a better survival. Despite these known sex differences, medical management recommendations are the same for women and men, because prospective sex-specific clinical trials have not been performed. However, our review raises some concerns that women might respond differently to therapy.",

Although treatment with these agents generally does not result in adverse metabolic consequences, their use during human pregnancy has been associated with negative reactions. Here we report a premature baby with a history of oligohydramnios and maternal exposure to the ARB olmesartan medoxomil who was transferred to our institution with acute renal failure. Conservative treatment with diuretics and meticulous management of fluids and electrolytes resulted in an improvement in renal function in the patient. We conclude that olmesartan medoxomil may cause reversible renal failure in premature neonates.",

Vessel, lumen and plaque areas were measured in 711 5-mm-long matched coronary segments (perindopril 360, placebo 351). Each individual intracoronary ultrasound cross-section was binary labelled for the presence of calcium (yes/no), and the degree of calcium was assessed as a percentage of length. The segments were classified into three groups: 0-25, 25-50 and 50-100% (percentage of length) calcification. Coronary plaques with no or little calcium (0-25%) regressed on perindopril and did not change on placebo (-0.33+/-1.74 vs. -0.03+/-1.66, respectively; P = 0.04). Plaques containing moderate calcium (group 25-50%) did not change and plaques with severe amounts of calcification (group 50-100%) equally progressed.",

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) are effective for BP control and stroke protection, but their use may be limited by patient tolerability. Angiotensin receptor blockers appear to provide similar BP control compared with ACE-Is and may also offer the clinician the added benefit of primary and secondary stroke prevention, with the potential for fewer tolerability issues.", 
    "69": "Albuminuria has a strong, continuous, direct, linear relationship with adverse cardiovascular (CV) outcomes and chronic kidney disease progression. Even at levels below the accepted upper limit of what is considered \"normal\" daily albumin excretion (< 30 mg/24 h), a relationship between albumin excretion level and adverse CV events is evident. Primary care clinicians (eg, physicians, nurse practitioners, physicians' assistants) are usually the first point of contact for patients at risk for CV and kidney disease. Hence, identifying and treating problematic albuminuria levels are important in primary care. Both the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) endorse routine annual screening for microalbuminuria (small amounts of albumin in the urine). Once excess albumin excretion is detected, clinicians must employ aggressive CV risk reduction. To optimize outcomes, treatment of microalbuminuria often requires the combined skills of experts in primary care, cardiology, metabolic disease, and nephrology. Although blood pressure reduction usually improves microalbuminuria, agents that block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) are most efficacious. Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockers (ie, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, direct renin inhibitors) may confer CV and kidney advantages in high-risk patients. Their effects on microalbuminuria reduction are greater than those associated with attaining guideline-recommended blood pressure goals. Effective RAAS blockade sometimes induces transient changes in creatinine and potassium, which merit consistent monitoring for the first 2 to 3 months of their use, but rarely necessitate discontinuation. This article also presents an approach to managing increases in creatinine and potassium that should fit comfortably in the hands of primary care clinicians.",

No significant changes were observed in the serum creatinine levels and estimated glomerular filtration rate. The urinary protein/creatinine ratio was, however, significantly decreased. Similarly, the regression line of 1/serum creatinine level was significantly increased after administration of losartan/hydrochlorothiazide. None of the patients exhibited a significant increase in the occurrence of adverse effects.", 
    "73": "Our results demonstrated that a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide had a renoprotective effect due to its blood pressure-lowering effect.

The blood pressure (BP) measurement made during the patient's recent visit and documented in the medical files was used in the study. Controlled BP values for hypertensive patients with diabetes mellitus were defined per JNC 7 guidelines: 130/80 mmHg or lower. Proportions of use of 5 different antihypertensive drug classes were compared between patients with controlled and uncontrolled BP.",

No significant differences in age, gender, body weight, duration of hypertension or diabetes, renal function, average number of anti-hypertensive medications and doses of most commonly reported antihypertensive medications were found between controlled and uncontrolled BP groups. ACE-I/ARB was the most commonly used drug class in both groups. Overall, the use of ACE-I/ARB, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, alpha-blockers and multi drug regimens were also not significantly different between the controlled and uncontrolled groups. However, overall use of diuretics was significantly higher in controlled group than uncontrolled group (59.5% versus 45.7%, p < 0.001).", 
    "77": "Despite the common use of ACE-I/ ARB as recommended per JNC 7th report, the majority of the patients had uncontrolled BP. Diuretics is an important drug class in attaining target BP.

    "78": "Carotid artery disease underlies a significant proportion of ischaemic strokes. Whilst secondary prevention by drug treatment is the first step in managing patients with known carotid stenoses, evidence from a number of large randomised controlled trials have clearly demonstrated a benefit for surgical treatment in symptomatic patients with moderate-to-severe stenosis. In asymptomatic patients with severe stenosis a benefit is conferred by surgery in selected patients. Carotid endarterectomy has formed the mainstay of surgical treatment. Endovascular angioplasty (with/without stenting) for carotid stenoses has been proposed as a viable or even superior alternative to carotid endarterectomy. The results from four large randomised controlled trials comparing the two modalities, considered together suggest a marginally better outcome for carotid endarterectomy compared with angioplasty in terms of perioperative mortality and stroke, though the results of further studies are awaited. For carotid surgery, a multi-centre randomised controlled trial evaluating the use of local anaesthesia versus general anaesthesia demonstrated no significant difference in outcome. Refinements in surgical technique such as patch angioplasty and intraluminal shunting provide equivocal benefit, with wide variation in their usage and in the results of studies evaluating them. More robust evidence supporting or refuting a benefit for these techniques is required.", 
    "79": "Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) play a vital role in the management of hypertension. Peripheral edema is the most common side effect reported with CCB monotherapy, especially with high-dose dihydropyridine CCBs. CCB-related peripheral edema is a dose-limiting effect that is usually medically benign but can compromise patient adherence. CCB-related peripheral edema may cause considerable discomfort and patient concern. Patients presenting with peripheral edema should undergo assessment for drug and nondrug causes. Rather than lowering the CCB dose or switching to another monotherapy, combination therapy (e.g, CCB plus a renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor) can enhance blood pressure control, generally with lower doses of individual agents, and lessen the risk of adverse events. As recommended by consensus guidelines, addition of a renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor as part of combination therapy may accelerate the time to goal blood pressure as well as help alleviate peripheral edema in affected patients. Successful management of CCB-related peripheral edema with lifestyle changes and rational combination therapy is likely to improve blood pressure control and patient outcomes.",

The 4G/4G or D/D genotype of PCOS with SAB patients had significantly higher PAI-1 levels than non-SAB women.", 
    "83": "The ACE D/I and PAI-1 4G/5G gene polymorphisms might represent risk factor in PCOS with SAB. Homozygosity for ACE D or PAI-1 4G polymorphisms as well as compound carrier status are significant positive explanatory variable for PCOS patients with SAB, which may result in increased PAI-1 concentrations and hypofibrinolysis and contribute to early pregnancy loss.", 
    "84": "Studies show negative correlations between heart rate variability (HRV) and inflammatory markers. In cardiac patients, depression is related to both. We investigated links between short-term HRV and inflammatory markers in relation to depression in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients. We measured C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), depression symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory, BDI-II), and SDNN, high frequency (HF) and low frequency (LF) power at rest in 682 (553 men) patients approximately two months post-ACS. There were no differences in HRV measures between those with and without elevated depressions symptoms (BDI-II >or= 14). However, all HRV measures were negatively and significantly associated with both inflammatory markers. Relationships were stronger in patients with BDI-II >or= 14. Differences were significant for CRP and not explained by covariates (including age, sex, previous MI, left ventricular ejection fraction, coronary bypass surgery at index admission, diabetes, smoking, body mass index (BMI), fasting cholesterol, fasting glucose, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers, statins, and antidepressants). HRV independently accounted for at least 4% of the variance in CRP in the depressed, more than any factor except BMI. Relationships between measures of inflammation and autonomic function are stronger among depressed than non-depressed cardiac patients. Interventions targeting regulation of both autonomic control and inflammation may be of particular importance.",

In the ONTARGET trial in patients with hypertension at high cardiovascular risk, ACE inhibitor/ARB combination therapy provided no significant clinical outcome benefits over monotherapy, and was associated with a worse safety and tolerability profile. These results raise the question of whether ACE inhibitor/ARB, direct renin inhibitor (DRI)/ACE inhibitor and DRI/ARB combinations are of clinical value.",

In patients with hypertension, ACE inhibitor/ARB combinations provided limited additional reductions in blood pressure (BP) over monotherapy. Outcomes benefits were unclear: VALIANT and ONTARGET demonstrated no enhanced outcome benefit of combination therapy over monotherapy; Val-HeFT and CHARM-Added showed reduced morbidity/mortality in patients with heart failure, but at the expense of poorer tolerability. Combination therapy with the DRI aliskiren and an ACE inhibitor or ARB provided significant additional BP reductions over monotherapy in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension, and reduced surrogate markers of organ damage in patients with heart failure or diabetic nephropathy, with generally similar safety and tolerability to the component monotherapies. No morbidity and mortality data for DRI/ACE inhibitor or DRI/ARB combinations are currently available.",

A rapid and sensitive analysis method or ACE activity by quantifying simultaneously the substrate hippuryl-histidyl-leucine and its product hippuric acid using an ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) was first developed and applied to assay the inhibitory activities against ACE of several natural phenolic compounds. The established UPLC-MS method showed obvious advantages over the conventional HPLC analysis in shortened running time (3.5 min), lower limit of detection (5 pg) and limit of quantification (18 pg), and high selectivity aided by MS detection in selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode. Among the six natural products screened, five compounds, caffeic acid, caffeoyl acetate, ferulic acid, chlorogenic acid and resveratrol indicated potent in vitro ACE inhibitory activity with IC(50) values of 2.527 +/- 0.032, 3.129 +/- 0.016, 10.898 +/- 0.430, 15.076 +/- 1.211 and 6.359 +/- 0.086 mm, respectively.

Addition of the mineralocorticoid receptor blocker (MRB), spironolactone, led to moderate reduction in daily urinary protein excretion. However, spironolactone had to be inevitably discontinued due to gynecomastia. Replacement of spironolactone with the selective MRB, eplerenone, added to the preceding treatment with ACE-I and ARB, resulted in remarkable reduction of daily urinary protein excretion to less than 0.2 g. This case suggests that triple blockade of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) system with ACE-I, ARB, and MRB could be useful for CKD patients with massive proteinuria.",

    "126": "Heart failure (HF) still poses an enormous clinical challenge, as its incidence, morbidity, and mortality rates are continuously rising. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) constitute the most ubiquitous superfamily of plasma membrane receptors and represent the single most important type of therapeutic drug target. Because there is overstimulation of the failing heart by various endogenous ligands, such as catecholamines and angiotensin II--which by activating their cognate GPCRs in cardiac muscle induce detrimental effects--therapeutic targeting of these receptors has been pursued. This research has led to the development of successful and useful drug classes, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-adrenergic receptor blockers. However, there still is a need to develop innovative treatments that might be more effective at reversing compromised myocyte function. Over the past several years, much evidence has accumulated indicating that a single GPCR, activated by the same endogenous ligand, can elicit several different signaling pathways with quite different, and often opposite, cellular effects. Because the aforementioned ligands, currently used for HF, target these receptors on their extracellular interface, thus merely preventing the endogenous agonists from binding the receptor, they inhibit all the signaling pathways elicited by the receptor indiscriminately. Importantly, several of these pathways emanating from the same GPCR can actually be beneficial for therapy, so their enhancement rather than their blockade is desirable for HF therapy. This highlights the need for selective targeting of GPCR-induced signaling pathways on the intracellular interface of the receptor, which might produce new and innovative therapies for cardiovascular disease.",

This article provides an overview of HF-PEF and its pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment, with a focus on clinical trials using renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockers. Inhibitors of the RAAS have been studied in HF-PEF to determine whether their benefits extend beyond blood pressure control. However, the 3 trials conducted to date (CHARM-Preserved, PEP-CHF, and I-PRESERVE) with candesartan, perindopril, and irbesartan, have failed to demonstrate significant morbidity and mortality benefits. Although no agent has proven statistically significant benefits in morbidity and mortality in HF-PEF, recent studies have added to the breadth of clinical data and understanding of the demographics of these patients.",

A retrospective multivariate analysis of medical claims for 14,327 patients receiving and 7905 not receiving an ACEI or ARB after discharge for MI or HF was conducted. Rehospitalization for MI or HF was lower for treated vs untreated patients (MI: odds ratio [OR]=0.53, P<.001; HF: OR=0.52, P<.001). Rehospitalization was lower in treated patients with high medication compliance (medication possession ratio [MPR]>80%) and medium compliance (MPR 40%-79%) vs patients with low compliance (ORs for MI: high=0.54, medium=0.69; P<.001); ORs for HF: high=0.38, medium=0.62; P<.001). In conclusion, ACEI or ARB therapy initiated after hospitalization for MI or HF reduced risk of rehospitalization, and greater risk reduction was achieved with higher medication compliance.",

In the PICXEL and PREMIER trials, SBP/DBP decreases of 16.3/8.1 mmHg (p < 0.0001) and 2.5/2.6 mmHg, respectively, were noted when Per4/Ind1.25 was doubled to Per8/Ind2.5 (decreases from 167.7/101.7 to 151.4/93.6 in PICXEL and from 154.9/92.1 to 152.4/89.5 in PREMIER, respectively). As a consequence more patients had normalised blood pressure (22% and 17%), more patients responded to treatment (68% and 45%), and 29% and 10% of non-responders became responders, in PICXEL and PREMIER, respectively. Additional end-organ benefits were also noted with Per8/Ind2.5. In PICXEL, significant decreases from baseline in left ventricular mass were noted with all three doses, with a 17.5 g/m(2) decrease from baseline in patients whose maximum dose was Per8/Ind2.5 (from 148.5 g/m(2) +/- 39.5 (mean +/- SD) to 131 g/m(2); p < 0.0001). In PREMIER, changes in albumin excretion rate were also noted with all three doses, with a 45% reduction from baseline in patients whose maximum dose was Per8/Ind2.5 (p < 0.0001). When safety data, including potassium levels, were analysed, the increase in dose to Per8/Ind2.5 did not have a notable impact on the safety profile of perindopril/indapamide.",

Our aim was to compare the effects of different subclasses of CCBs on the deterioration of renal function in chronic kidney disease (CKD). This is a prospective, observational cohort study in a single center. The subjects were 107 nondiabetic CKD patients. The rate of deterioration of estimated glomerular filtration rate (DeltaeGFR) was calculated by [last visit eGFR - baseline eGFR/follow-up duration]. Multivariate analysis was performed using the change in urinary protein (DeltaUP) and DeltaeGFR during follow-up as response variables. CCB subclasses were L-type in 76 patients, T- and L-type in 28 patients, and nondihydropyridines in 6 patients. Multiregression analysis indicated that higher baseline proteinuria (UP) and the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers were associated with the decrease of UP, while the use of L-type CCBs, prednisolone, and probucol was associated with the increase of UP. The use of T- and L-type CCBs, ACEIs and diuretics was associated with a good outcome in terms of DeltaeGFR, whereas chronic glomerulonephritis, polycystic kidney disease, and higher baseline eGFR and UP were associated with a poor outcome. It is suggested that the use of T- and L-type CCB among other subclasses may improve the outcome of patients with nondiabetic CKD in terms of renal function.",

We examined the prevalence and control of coronary artery disease risk factors and the outcomes of 367 prior CABG patients who underwent diagnostic coronary angiography between October 1, 2004 and May 31, 2007 at the Dallas Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Mean age was 65 +/- 9 years, 97% were men, and the mean time from CABG to diagnostic angiography was 8.2 +/- 6.1 years.

After a mean follow-up of 1.4 +/- 0.8 years, the incidence of death and major cardiovascular events was 10% and 32%, respectively. In spite of significant improvement compared to previous studies and good compliance with indicated medications, contemporary prior CABG patients undergoing coronary angiography still have multiple and poorly controlled coronary artery disease risk factors and high risk for cardiovascular events. Novel pharmacologic and behavioral treatment strategies are needed.",

Because vasopressin may also play a role in the progression of renal disease, we measured the effect of a dual V(1a) and V(2) vasopressin receptor antagonist (RWJ-676070) alone or combined with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockade on proteinuria and renal disease progression during overt nephropathy. Twenty-one days after renal mass reduction, a time of established injury, rats were given vehicle, RWJ-676070, enalapril, losartan, RWJ-676070 plus enalapril, or losartan in drinking water for an additional 39 days. RWJ-676070 returned the blood pressure to pre-treatment levels, which were significantly lower than those in vehicle-treated rats. Enalapril, losartan, and the combined therapies reduced blood pressure to a greater extent. RWJ-676070 afforded a partial antiproteinuric effect, which was enhanced by the addition of enalapril or losartan. Renal functional impairment, and glomerular and tubular changes were partially ameliorated by RWJ-676070; parameters significantly improved with either enalapril or losartan alone and improved to a greater extent with the combined therapies. Our findings suggest that vasopressin receptor antagonists could be of additional therapeutic value in the treatment of chronic proteinuric nephropathy.",

An association of CS with membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) type 1 is rare, with only two prior cases reported. Here we describe a 45-year-old man with no prior medical history who presented initially with microhaematuria, subnephrotic proteinuria and hypocomplementaemia. A renal biopsy revealed MPGN type 1 with negative serologic workup for secondary causes. The patient was treated conservatively with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Several months later, he developed daily non-bloody diarrhoea and was found to have worsening hypoalbuminaemia, hypophosphataemia and severe iron deficiency anaemia. A diagnosis of CS was established based on elevated tTGA (IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase) antibody and positive IgA antiendomysial antibody titres. Proteinuria resolved completely following the initiation of a gluten-free diet, without the use of immunosuppressive therapy and despite tapering of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. This case illustrates that CS-associated MPGN may precede overt clinical evidence of coeliac disease and may respond to gluten-free diet, without resort to immunosuppressive therapy.",

She related a recent episode of a bronchial infection that was treated during the previous eight days with paracetamol (500mg, 2 doses only), chlorpheniramine, betamethasone and clindamycin. After an initial clinical and laboratorial improvement, she began to complain of pruritus of the palms and soles. Thereafter, vesicles evolving to blisters developed and a deterioration of her general health ensued. Serologies for hepatitis A, B, and C viruses were negative. Intrahepatic cholestasis and Stevens Johnson Syndrome (SJS) were the final diagnosis. The association of the Stevens Johnson Syndrome and intrahepatic cholestasis simultaneously, related to adverse drug reactions, is very rare. The drugs reportedly involved are mainly antibiotics, such as ampicillin, vancomycin, amoxicillin/clavulinic acid and erythromycin. Other drugs involved are non-steroidal anti-inflamatory drugs, such as mefenamic acid, ibuprofen, and sulindac. The reactions can be minor or severe and can even cause death, an outcome that has been reported in patients of all races and ethnic groups, but appears to be more rare in patients of Latin origin.

ACE-I therapy may reduce renal, peritoneal, and colonic K(+) losses. We examined the effect of ACE-I therapy on serum, urinary, and dialysate K(+) in a cross-section of peritoneal and hemodialysis patients. Serum, 24-h urine K(+), and peritoneal dialysate excretion K(+) levels were measured and the results were compared in the various dialysis and treatment groups. Eighty-one hemodialysis (HD) and 32 peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients were included. Serum K(+) in HD patients with no residual renal function (RRF) was higher in those receiving ACE-I therapy (P = 0.02). Serum K(+) levels in HD patients receiving ACE-I treatments with RRF was similar to that in oligoanuric HD patients not receiving an ACE-I. Urinary K(+) excretion was significantly reduced in those on ACE-I therapy versus those not on an ACE-I (P < 0.05). Mean serum K(+) was lower in PD versus HD patients (P < 0.05). PD patients with no RRF on ACE-I therapy had higher serum K(+) concentrations (P = 0.002) and dialysate K(+) excretion was lower (P = 0.05), in comparison with PD patients not on an ACE-I. PD patients with RRF on ACE-I therapy had higher serum K(+) concentrations compared with those not on ACE-I therapy (P = 0.03). Both urinary and dialysate K(+) excretion were reduced (P = 0.001 and P = 0.002, respectively). ACE-I therapy increases serum K(+) concentration in dialysis patients. PD patients have relatively lower serum K(+) levels compared with HD patients. In PD patients, ACE-I therapy reduces dialysate K(+). These changes may result from reduced peritoneal movement of K(+).",

In this retrospective study on 505 renal transplant recipients, we analyzed blood pressure and graft survival according to antihypertensive treatment with ACE-I/ARB and/or calcium channel blockers (CCB) over a period of 10 years. Patients were stratified according to their blood pressure 1 year after transplantation [controlled (<or=130/80 mmHg; CTR, 181 patients) and noncontrolled (>130/80 mmHg; non-CTR, 324 patients)] and according to antihypertensive treatment (ACE-I/ARB and/or CCB taken for at least 2 years). One year after transplantation, 88.4% of CTR and 96.6% of non-CTR received antihypertensive treatment (P < 0.05). Graft survival was longer in CTR than in non-CTR (P < 0.05). Importantly, graft survival was longer in patients who received long-term treatment with ACEI/ARB, CCB, or a combination of ACEI/ARB and CCB (P < 0.001). The beneficial effect of ACEI/ARB therapy was more pronounced in non-CTR compared with that of CTR. We conclude that blood pressure control is a key target for long-term graft survival in renal transplant patients. Long-term ACEI/ARB and CCB therapy is beneficial for graft survival, especially in patients with diabetes and/or albuminuria.",

ACE inhibitory activity of the casein miso paste was higher than that of the general (casein-free) miso paste after fermentation for 7 days. The levels of ACE inhibitory peptides, Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro, were increased in the casein miso paste during the fermentation. Significant antihypertensive effects of casein miso paste compared to water and the general miso paste (P<0.05 and P<0.05) were confirmed in spontaneously hypertensive rats at a dosage of 1.8 g of the casein miso paste/kg of BW. Taken into account of minimum effective dosages of Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro in previous clinical studies, these results suggest that casein miso paste might have the potential to control blood pressure in humans.",

Several recent large clinical trials have confirmed their efficacy not only in lowering blood pressure but also in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in hypertensive patients with a normal or high cardiovascular risk profile. In clinical trials such as ALLHAT, VALUE or ASCOT, an amlodipine-based therapy was at least as effective, when not slightly superior, in lowering blood pressure and sometimes more effective in preventing target organ damages than blood pressure lowering strategies based on the use of diuretics, beta-blockers and blockers of the renin-angiotensin system. One of the main clinical side effects of the first and second generation CCBs including amlodipine is the development of peripheral edema. The incidence of leg edema can be markedly reduced by combining the CCB with a blocker of the renin-angiotensin system. This strategy has now led to the development of several fixed-dose combinations of amlodipine and angiotensin II receptor antagonists. Another alternative to lower the incidence of edema is to use CCBs of the third generation such as lercanidipine. Indeed, although no major clinical trials have been conducted with this compound, clinical studies have shown that lercanidipine and amlodipine have a comparable antihypertensive efficacy but with significantly less peripheral edema in patients receiving lercanidipine. In some countries, lercanidipine is now available in a single-pill association with an ACE inhibitor thereby further improving its efficacy and tolerability profile.",

The recent ONTARGET study showed no reduction in primary outcomes when an ACE-I-ARB combination was compared to an ACE-I alone, despite 2.4/1.4 mmHg lower BP in the former group. In proteinuric chronic kidney disease, an ACE-I-ARB combination reduces proteinuria and disease progression more than monotherapy, but the ONTARGET study showed an increase in renal endpoints in the combined group. Aliskiren offers a novel approach to renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibition. As monotherapy in hypertension, aliskiren is of similar efficacy to thiazides, calcium channel blockers and ARBs. In combination with other RAS inhibitors at maximal dosage aliskiren has a small synergistic effect on BP (additional 4/2 mmHg reduction). Early data suggest a role for aliskiren in preventing end-organ damage but, considering the ONTARGET results with an ACE-I-ARB combination, outcome studies are needed before the use of aliskiren can be recommended in combination with other RAS inhibitors. As monotherapy, aliskiren should probably be reserved for use as an alternative to ACE-Is or ARBs, where these are ineffective or poorly tolerated.",

To examine the descriptive epidemiology of acute HF in residents of a large New England metropolitan area during the 2 study years of 1995 and 2000, we reviewed the medical records of patients hospitalized with acute HF at 11 medical centers in the Worcester, Massachusetts, metropolitan area during 1995 and 2000 for purposes of collecting information about patients' sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, hospital management approaches, and hospital and postdischarge mortalities. The mean age of 4,537 residents of the Worcester metropolitan area hospitalized with decompensated HF was 76 years, 57% were women, and most study patients had been previously diagnosed with several co-morbidities. The average duration of hospitalization was 6.3 days and 6.8% of patients died during hospitalization. Diuretics (98%) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (54%) were the most common medications used to treat acutely ill patients. The 1- and 5-year death rates of hospital survivors were 39% and 77%, respectively, with no change observed in these death rates between our 2 study years.

Recently, the use of a new synthetic substrate, 3-hydroxybutyrylglycyl-glycyl-glycine (3HB-GGG), for the assay of ACE inhibitory activity has been confirmed. To construct a rapid, economical, and automatic determination system of ACE inhibitory activity using 3HB-GGG, a flow injection analysis (FIA) system with enzymatic reactors was developed in this study. Enzyme reactors were composed of aminoacylase and 3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase immobilized separately on CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B. The assay condition was optimized in terms of the conversion of 3HB-G into NADH by the enzymatic reactors when the reaction solution containing 3HB-G generated from 3HB-GGG (after the incubation with ACE) was repetitively injected into the FIA system. Under the optimized conditions, 3HB-G was converted to 3HB, and then 3HB was oxidized by NAD(+) to form NADH. The developed system successfully detected practical ACE inhibitors with a great sensitivity, high sampling frequency (10 samples h(-1)) and a durable stability of the enzymatic reactors.",

The \"cardiometabolic clustering\" is characterized by well-known alterations that increase cardiovascular risk profile such as insulin-resistance, endothelial dysfunction, arterial stiffening, cardiac hypertrophy, and sympathetic activation. The present article will review the evidence collected throughout by years that an increase in the different markers of adrenergic drive, such as plasma norepinephrine and muscle sympathetic nerve traffic, characterizes this condition. Frequently, the increase also involves heart rate, as documented by the results of different epidemiological studies, such as the Pressioni Arteriose Monitorate E Loro Associazioni, in which an increase in heart rate has been shown in patients with metabolic syndrome, in which this hemodynamic parameter has been assessed in the doctor's office, at home, or during the 24-hour period. Finally, current findings suggest that in metabolic syndrome heart rate displays a significant correlation with other indirect and direct adrenergic markers. Taken together, these findings reinforce the concept that drugs used in the metabolic syndrome should exert sympathoinhibitory effects.",

Because athletes often have white coat HTN, BP recordings outside the office are also necessary. The 36th Bethesda Conference classified sports according to their varying physiologic demands and provided specific recommendations for the evaluation, treatment, and sport participation of athletes with HTN. In general, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and other vasodilators are the medications of choice for active and athletic patients because of their limited interference with cardiovascular conditioning. Other agents can be used but some sports governing bodies proscribe the use of certain antihypertensive medications such as beta-blockers for elite athletes.",

    "172": "Aldosterone production causes vascular injury and may occur despite the long-term administration of angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitors (ACE-I) (ie, aldosterone breakthrough). The angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) telmisartan can function as a ligand for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma. Stimulation of PPAR gamma has been demonstrated to raise adiponectin production and suppress angiotensin II type 1 receptor expression. Thus, we investigated the effect of the ACE-I perindopril erbumin (perindopril) and the ARB telmisartan on plasma levels of aldosterone and adiponectin.Patients with essential hypertension were randomly assigned to receive 48 weeks of perindopril (2-8 mg/d) or telmisartan (20-80 mg/d). We measured adiponectin, aldosterone, angiotensin II, and renin at weeks 0, 8, 24, and 48.A total of 53 subjects were randomized. Data on 51 subjects (25 in the perindopril group and 26 in the telmisartan group; mean age, 65.1 years) were available for analyses. Plasma aldosterone decreased significantly in both the telmisartan (69.9+/-5.6 to 58.1+/-5.4 pg/mL) and perindopril (74.1+/-4.7 to 64.7+/-5.3 pg/mL) groups at 8 weeks, but returned toward the baseline in the perindopril group (67.9+/-4.1 pg/mL) at 24 weeks. Plasma glycated hemoglobin levels or urine albumin did not change significantly after the treatment in either group.Telmisartan seemed to be more effective at suppressing aldosterone and raising adiponectin levels than perindopril; however, improvements in insulin sensitivity and albuminuria were not detected. These results are consistent with the idea that the use of an ARB with PPAR gamma stimulating activity is equivalent to ACE-I for the treatment of hypertension.",

We retrospectively assessed the long-term efficacy of combination therapy with pravastatin (10 mg/day) and enalapril (5 mg/day) in addition to antiarrhythmic drugs (AAD) for maintaining sinus rhythm in patients with AF. This study included 319 patients (221 men, 98 women, mean age, 68+/-10 years, mean follow-up period, 50+/-34 months) who were divided into 4 groups: group I (n=191) without combination therapy--namely pravastatin(-) and enalapril(-); group II (n=81) with combination therapy--pravastatin (-) and enalapril (+) (n=81); group III (n=29) with combination therapy--pravastatin (+) and enalapril (-); and group IV (n=18) with combination therapy--pravastatin (+) and enalapril (+). The percentages of patients free from conversion to permanent AF at 12, 36, 60, 90, and 120 months were as follows: group I 88, 83, 78, 75, and 73%, respectively; group II 96, 88, 79, 77, and 75%, respectively; group III 100, 97, 91, 91, and 86%, respectively; group IV 100, 100, 100, 94, and 94%, respectively. The actuarial rate free from conversion to permanent AF at 120 months was significantly higher in group IV than in group I (P<0.05). The results suggest that in patients with paroxysmal AF, the addition of both pravastatin and enalapril to AAD was more effective for maintaining sinus rhythm in terms of an upstream therapy.", 
    "174": "The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the ideal control of atrial fibrillation (AF) associated with hypertensive patients depends on the usage of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors or whether it occurs regardless of the kind of antihypertensive agents used. The control of AF was compared in 112 outpatients between 1) those with or without the administration of RAS inhibitors, and 2) those with an ideal or poor control of the blood pressure (BP) regardless of the kind of antihypertensive therapy used. The therapies with or without RAS inhibitors did not yield any significant difference in the AF control states, even though RAS inhibitors had been administered to the patient group with a high proportion of organic heart disease. The ideal BP control group exhibited a significantly better AF control in comparison to the poor BP control group. The former group had a significantly smaller left atrial diameter determined by ultrasonic echocardiography. BP control itself may essentially be important for preventing AF in the general patient population. Poor BP control seemed to have an affect on worsening AF possibly via left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, followed by left atrial overload.", 
    "175": "Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is a major health problem worldwide. This article reviews studies clarifying the effects of gene-activating agents on the atherosclerotic vascular process, the occurrence of fatal and nonfatal atherosclerotic disease, and all-cause mortality. Studies originating in the 1970s linked drug-caused gene induction and high protein and cytochrome P450 concentrations in the liver with high apolipoprotein AI (apo AI) and HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) and reduced LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in plasma and presented the view that the inducers, gene-activators, have beneficial exploitable effects against atherosclerosis. The following studies have shown that P450-enzymes respond to cholesterol accumulation and act in maintaining cholesterol homeostasis and that gene-activators act against the atherosclerotic process. The compounds include drugs indicated for dyslipidemias, such as statins, fibrates, niacin and cholestyramine, as well as compounds used for other purposes, including calcium channel blockers, angiotensin receptor blockers and glitazones. The compounds generate signaling mediators such as oxysterols and eicosanoids. The gene-activators upregulate, via the activation of nuclear receptors, genes encoding proteins such as apo AI and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) A1 transporters that efflux cellular cholesterol, transport it to the liver and excrete it into bile, and prevent cholesterol absorption in the intestine. Several statins, niacin, cholestyramine, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin receptor blockers, pioglitazone and etidronate regress atherosclerosis in coronary and /or carotid arteries. Other compounds, including fibrates, phenobarbital and alcohol also have positive antiatherogenic effects. Several gene-activators reduce mortality and / or morbidity from coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease, and also death from any cause.",

In clinical trials conducted in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension, the angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) telmisartan has been shown to provide reduction of blood pressure throughout the 24-h dosing interval. Clinical trials have also demonstrated that ARBs are effective agents in reducing the risk of cardiovascular mortality, stroke, heart failure and new-onset atrial fibrillation. Recently, the ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET) study established that telmisartan reduces morbidity and mortality in a broad cross-section of patients at high risk for heart and vascular events, to an extent similar to that of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril. In addition, ONTARGET demonstrated that telmisartan is somewhat better tolerated than ramipril. Attributes such as effective blood pressure lowering, tolerability and convincing outcomes data mean that ARBs satisfy the requirements for first-line antihypertensive agents.",

In addition, telmisartan offers superior tolerability to that of ramipril. Moreover, the finding in this study that combination therapy with telmisartan and ramipril produced no further reduction in cardiovascular events than either drug alone, despite producing greater reductions in blood pressure, highlights the potential importance of endothelial effects of renin-angiotensin system blockade in cardiovascular protection.",

In PRoFESS, 20 332 ischemic stroke patients were randomized to telmisartan 80 mg versus placebo and to two antiplatelets in a 2 x 2 factorial design. After a mean exposure of 2 years, telmisartan showed a nonsignificant lower rate of recurrent stroke versus placebo [880 versus 934; hazard ratio 0.95; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86-1.04]. In a post-hoc analysis, from 6 months, telmisartan significantly reduced the number of strokes versus placebo (533 versus 608; hazard ratio 0.88; 95% CI 0.78-0.99; P = 0.042). In the stroke subgroup of ONTARGET, telmisartan 80 mg showed a trend toward reducing recurrent stroke versus ramipril 10 mg (hazard ratio 0.91; 95% CI 0.79-1.05). In the TRANSCEND study, 5926 patients who were intolerant to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were treated with 80 mg telmisartan or placebo.

In ONTARGET, the first angiotensin II receptor blocker-based study to be performed in a broader population of patients without congestive heart failure and/or left ventricular hypertrophy/dysfunction, telmisartan provided cardiovascular protection that was noninferior to ramipril. However, greater blockade of the renin-angiotensin system, using their combination, was not superior to ramipril alone. Telmisartan was better tolerated than ramipril in this high-risk population: notably, the incidence of cough and angioedema was significantly lower with telmisartan alone. Thus, telmisartan provides comparable efficacy to ramipril with less adverse events, which may encourage patient compliance.", 
    "183": "Impaired kidney function increases the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Coexistence of hypertension and type 2 diabetes increases the risk of kidney damage, hypertension being an independent risk factor for kidney disease progression. Angiotensin II, through its inflammatory, proliferative, and thrombotic effects, adversely affects renal perfusion and increases oxidative stress, thus playing a pivotal role in kidney disease progression. Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors improve markers of kidney disease and slow kidney disease progression in diabetic and nondiabetic patients; this kidney protection may be in addition to their antihypertensive activity in those with advanced proteinuric nephropathy. Key beneficial effects of ARBs and ACE inhibitors throughout the kidney disease continuum are primarily explained by blood pressure lowering effects and partially by their direct blockade of angiotensin II. Recent studies have shown that telmisartan, an ARB with high lipophilicity and the longest half-life compared with other ARBs, provides benefits on markers of cardiovascular risk, that is, microalbuminuria and slowing of early-stage nephropathy.",

Most patients show nephrotic syndrome; nearly half progress to chronic renal failure. Intensive therapy with lipid-lowering agents reportedly engenders clinical remission with histological resolution. We report the case of a 14-year-old Japanese female patient who had been in a nephrotic condition with hematuria from 4 years old and who had been diagnosed based on pathological and molecular examination at 7 years old. We initially treated the patient with probucol, enalapril (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor: ACEI), and dipyridamole from age 7, but achieved no improvement in her nephrotic status. Subsequently, we replaced probucol with bezafibrate at age 11 and added atorvastatin calcium hydrate and valsartan (angiotensin II receptor blocker: ARB) the following year. The next 3 years' treatment improved her nephrotic status, decreased serum apolipoprotein E, and markedly decreased intraglomerular lipoprotein thrombi. Early and intensive therapy with antilipidemic drugs combined with ACEI and ARB is inferred to be effective for LPG.", 
    "185": "Despite reported renoprotection with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs)/angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and notwithstanding their increased use, we continue to experience an epidemic of acute renal failure (ARF)/chronic kidney disease/end-stage renal disease. Consequently, concerns about iatrogenic renal failure have resurfaced. Different analysis of these trials revealed flaws such as recruitment of relatively younger patients with preserved baseline renal function, common utilization of lower end doses of ACEIs/ARBs, high drug discontinuation rates, excessive use of surrogate endpoints, inadequate reporting of adverse effects, and short duration studies. Again, lower 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure among patients in the ramipril arm of the micro-HOPE (Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation) study raises doubts of renoprotection beyond blood pressure lowering. The disappointing results from the ONTARGET (Ongoing Telmisartan Alone and in Combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial) study only compounded these doubts. We demonstrated significant renal salvage after ACEI/ARB was discontinued in chronic kidney disease patients recruited with increasing ARF while on ACEI/ARB. Apart from our reports, there are increasing reports incriminating the use of ACEI/ARB with ARF exacerbations. We conclude that close and indefinite monitoring of estimated glomerular filtration rate is an absolute must in these patients. The treating physician must be ready to consider trial discontinuation of ACEI/ARB, promptly. Combination ACEI + ARB therapy should be the exception, rather than the rule. Temporary withdrawal of ACEI/ARB before certain exposures, 'renoprevention', would only further improve the results of renoprotection.",

Some (but not all) studies have suggested that antihypertensive treatment is beneficial, reducing risk of decline and dementia. There are plausible mechanisms to support the possibility that hypertension may increase the risk of dementia. There is also evidence suggesting that the two dementia types thought to be most common, Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia, have overlapping risk factors. Seven placebo-controlled trials of antihypertensive treatment have assessed cognitive function, incident dementia, or both, with mixed outcomes. The Hypertension in the Very Elderly Trial (HYVET), despite showing reductions in mortality and stroke with active treatment, found no significant reduction of incident dementia, although the trial was stopped early. Meta-analyses used to explore this area further are inconclusive, and comparative trials are now required.",

This review deals with the clinical management of this dangerous association. The ankle-brachial index helps in the diagnosis of PAD and the estimation of risk. To control risk, lifestyle adaptation is essential. There is no consensus on a first choice of antihypertensive drug. Arguments favor angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, but most patients require several antihypertensive drugs to reach goal pressure (140/90 mm Hg or lower). Moreover, to control the risk of PAD, antiplatelet drugs, antihypertensive drugs, and statins are recommended.",

Interestingly, antihypertensive drugs exert different effects on brachial and central pressure. Traditional beta-blockers, such as atenolol, appear to have an adverse impact on central pressure, despite lowering brachial pressure. This may help to explain the results of recent large outcome studies using atenolol. Further research is required to clarify whether other antihypertensive agents lower central pressure beyond the effects observed on brachial pressure.",

It is expressed in adipocytes, immune cells, and cardiovascular cells that include cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells. PPARgamma plays a role in regulating cellular anti-inflammatory responses and is a mediator of insulin sensitization induced by thiazolidinediones, which also can reduce elevated blood pressure both clinically and experimentally. As a result, research regarding the role of PPARgamma in blood pressure homeostasis is ongoing. Recent studies have demonstrated that increases or decreases in blood pressure phenotype may be PPARgamma-dependent and involve a number of different signaling pathways. Furthermore, studies using PPARgamma mutant transgenic and knockout animal models provide further evidence regarding a role for endothelial-cell and vascular smooth muscle-cell PPARgamma in blood pressure regulation. However, there is a need for further research regarding PPARgamma--mediated mechanisms involved in maintaining physiologic control of blood pressure.", 
    "205": "Elevated blood pressure levels are highly prevalent and are a major reason for cardiovascular events and thus place a significant financial burden on healthcare systems worldwide. Guidelines recommend five first-line anti-hypertensive drug classes, but compelling indications may indicate favoring one drug class over another. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have demonstrated a blood pressure lowering efficacy which is at least comparable with other drug classes, including ACE inhibitors (ACE-I), beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers and diuretics. They have, in addition, a lower side effect profile than other drug classes and patients on ARBs are more persistent with therapy. Compelling indications for the use of ARBs are heart failure, post-myocardial infarction, diabetic nephropathy, proteinuria/microalbuminuria, left ventricular hypertrophy, atrial fibrillation, metabolic syndrome and ACE-I induced cough. The ARB irbesartan has demonstrated a high efficacy in lowering blood pressure, which has been shown to be at least comparable with ACE-Is and superior to other ARBs such as losartan and valsartan. This translated into a better cost-effectiveness for irbesartan than for valsartan and losartan in the treatment of hypertension. In addition, irbesartan has been shown to be effective in both early and late stage diabetic nephropathy. It has further demonstrated considerable cost savings over standard therapy including beta-blockers, diuretics and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers at all stages of kidney disease. Based on efficacy data from the Irbesartan Diabetic Nephropathy Trial and Reduction of Endpoints in NIDDM (non insulin dependant diabetes melitis) with the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan Study, it has also demonstrated cost savings over losartan in late stage renal disease. While both losartan and irbesartan are registered for the treatment of late stage diabetic nephropathy, irbesartan is also registered for early stage diabetic nephropathy in the EU. In summary, the data from randomized clinical trials on the efficacy of antihypertensive drugs provides an indication of their real value to patients. In addition observational data from clinical practice and proven end-organ protection in diabetic nephropathy provides further evidence of the true value of irbesartan compared to other ARBs in the treatment of hypertension.",

Adjusted results were similar. However, centrally active ACE inhibitors were associated with 65% less decline in 3MSE scores per year of exposure (P = .01), and noncentrally active ACE inhibitors were associated with a greater risk of incident dementia (adjusted HR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.00-1.43 per year of exposure) and greater odds of disability in IADLs (adjusted OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.03-1.30 per year of exposure) compared with other anti-HTN drugs.",

    "210": "Endothelin-1 (ET-1) has been implicated in many cardiovascular diseases, including acute heart failure (AHF) due to myocardial ischemia. Previously we described the oral endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE) inhibitor, PP36, and in this study, we investigated its cardioprotective effect in more detail, and examined the role of PP36 in the neurohormonal activation in rats that had been subjected to acute myocardial ischemia due to the microsphere embolization of coronary microcirculation. PP36 treatment (3.5 x 10(-5) M/kg/day) led to a significant fourfold decrease in hypertensive response when big-ET-1 was administered to healthy, conscious rats. ECE inhibition did not affect mortality during the first 48 hours after ischemia initiation. Systemic hemodynamic, heart function, and neurohormonal activation were analyzed in the healthy control group, the AHF group, and the AHF+PP36 group two days after AHF induction. In conscious rats in the AHF+PP36 group, mean arterial pressure (MAP) was restored and became similar to that of the MAP of the control group. In anesthetized rats, in the AHF+PP36 group, MAP was not restored and was 22% lower than the MAP of the control group. Myocardial contractility was partially restored and cardiac relaxation significantly improved after PP36 application. Further analysis of cardiac output and peripheral resistance in anesthetized rats revealed no differences between the AHF group and the AHF+PP36 group. There were no differences in plasma ET-1 concentration, serum angiotensin converting enzyme activity, and in the adrenal glands' catecholamine content between the AHF group and the AHF+PP36 group. However, rats in the AHF+PP36 group demonstrated a 60% decrease in cardiac endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) protein expression, and a 56% reduction of myocardial norepinephrine release, when compared with the AHF group's animals. These results suggest that PP36 can preserve heart function during the recovery from acute ischemic injury, and may modulate the cardiac norepinephrine release and eNOS protein level.", 
    "211": "Nuclear receptors (NRs) are major targets for drug discovery and have key roles in development and homeostasis as well as in many diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and cancer. NRs are ligand-dependent transcription factors that need to work in concert with so-called transcriptional coregulators, including corepressors and coactivators, to regulate transcription. Upon ligand binding, NRs undergo a conformational change, which alters their binding preference for coregulators. Short alpha-helical sequences in the coregulator proteins, LXXLL (in coactivators) or LXXXIXXXL (in corepressors), are essential for the NR-coregulator interactions. However, little is known on how specificity is dictated. To obtain a comprehensive overview of NR-coregulator interactions, we used a microarray approach based on interactions between NRs and peptides derived from known coregulators. Using the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) as a model NR, we were able to generate ligand-specific interaction profiles (agonist rosiglitazone versus antagonist GW9662 versus selective PPARgamma modulator telmisartan) and characterize NR mutants and isotypes (PPARalpha, -beta/delta, and -gamma). Importantly, based on the NR-coregulator interaction profile, we were able to identify TRIP3 as a novel regulator of PPARgamma-mediated adipocyte differentiation. These findings indicate that NR-coregulator interaction profiling may be a useful tool for drug development and biological discovery.",

These compounds showed inhibitory potency in the nanomolar range against both angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and neutral endopeptidase (NEP), whereas no inhibition of endothelin-converting enzyme-1 (ECE-1) was observed. The trifluoromethyl-derivatives were more potent than the parent unfluorinated analogues in the case of ACE, and less potent in the case of NEP.", 
    "213": "Two research groups in both North and South America independently discovered that renin released a novel vasopressor agent. The Argentine group named it hypertensin, and called its plasma protein substrate hypertensinogen. The group from the United States named it angiotonin. In 1958, Braun Menendez and Irvine Page suggested that the peptide should be named angiotensin. The combined name eventually became commonly used to avoid linguistic confusion. Research scientists and physicians today acknowledge that studies of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) have greatly improved our understanding of several diseases. Certainly, medical practice profited significantly from the synthesis and application of numerous pharmacological agents that antagonize either the biosynthesis or pharmacological responses of endogenously generated angiotensin II. Ultimately, discovery of the renin-angiotensin system led to many studies that resulted in therapies for vascular disease. This article briefly reviews research related to the discovery of angiotensin and indicates the importance of additional studies related to the RAS.", 
    "214": "Lead, a ubiquitous and potent neurotoxicant causes oxidative stress which leads to numerous neurobehavioral and physiological alterations. The ability of lead to bind sulfhydryl groups or compete with calcium could be one of the reasons for its debilitating effects. In the present study, we addressed: i) if chelation therapy could circumvent the altered oxidative stress and prevent neuronal apoptosis in chronic lead-intoxicated rats, ii) whether chelation therapy could reverse biochemical and behavioral changes, and iii) if mono or combinational therapy with captopril (an antioxidant) and thiol chelating agents (DMSA/MiADMSA) is more effective than individual thiol chelator in lead-exposed rats. Results indicated that lead caused a significant increase in reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide, and intracellular free calcium levels along with altered behavioral abnormalities in locomotor activity, exploratory behavior, learning, and memory that were supported by changes in neurotransmitter levels. A fall in membrane potential, release of cytochrome c, and DNA damage indicated mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis. Most of these alterations showed significant recovery following combined therapy with captopril with MiADMSA and to a smaller extend with captopril+DMSA over monotherapy with these chelators. It could be concluded from our present results that co-administration of a potent antioxidant (like captopril) might be a better treatment protocol than monotherapy to counter lead-induced oxidative stress. The major highlight of the work is an interesting experimental evidence of the efficacy of combinational therapy using an antioxidant with a thiol chelator in reversing neurological dystrophy caused due to chronic lead exposure in rats.",

The sensitivity and specificity of clinical judgment in the diagnosis of heart failure in patients with COPD can be enhanced by biological markers such as B-type natriuretic peptide and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide. Correct interpretation of imaging results (mainly echocardiographic findings) and lung function tests can also help establish the co-occurrence of both conditions.

In vivo, we measured the impact of R-568 (20 ng/min intravenously) on the acute changes in plasma renin activity (PRA) induced by either a 90 min infusion of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril, or the beta-receptor agonist isoproterenol, or of a vehicle in or after a furosemide challenge in conscious Wistar rats.",

Males exhibit a higher risk for cardiovascular events than women. The pericardial fluid (PF) is in direct contact with the epicardial sections of the coronary arteries and the perimyocardium. A systematic analysis of gender-specific or age-related differences in angiotensin-related pathways like bradykinin metabolism however, has not been performed in the PF so far. Therefore, the amounts of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and the rate of the degradation of bradykinin (BK) and the amounts/activity of major BK-degrading enzymes, aminopeptidase N (APN) and dipeptidyl-aminopeptidase IV (DPIV), were assessed in the pericardial fluid (PF) of 44 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. We found BK being degraded within the PF. Interestingly, there was an age-dependent decrease in the amounts of ACE protein in women. In elderly women, ACE/APN and ACE/DPIV ratios were substantially reduced to 41.4% or 29.4% respectively (p<0.05). In contrast, an age-dependent decline of ACE protein and ACE/protease ratios were not found in men. In men and women, total BK degradation correlated with age (r=0.5; p=0.021) further supporting a switch in BK metabolising enzymes in elderly women. Thus, we can show age- and gender-dependent differences in BK metabolism within the PF in patients with coronary artery disease. The present finding that the expression of ACE is lowest in elderly women, despite the presence of similar BK degradation, might help to explain the potentially reduced therapeutic effects of ACE inhibitors in elderly women.",

Two of these identified peptides with sequences LHLPLP and LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP, possess ACE-inhibitory activity in vitro and antihypertensive activity in vivo. The results showed that LHLPLP was resistant to digestive enzymes. In contrast, LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP was totally hydrolyzed and its activity decreased after incubation with pepsin and a pancreatic extract. The peptide LHLPLP was incubated with ACE and was found to be a true inhibitor of the enzyme and to exhibit a competitive inhibitor pattern. A structure-activity relationship study of this peptide was carried out by synthesizing several modified peptides related to the sequence LHLPLP. The substitution of amino acid Leu in the penultimate position by Gly improved the ACE-inhibitory activity twofold and the substitution of Pro at C-terminal position by Arg increased the activity twofold, with an IC50 of LHLPLR as low as 1.8 microM.",

    "234": "A recent analysis of clinical studies suggests that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors might reduce bone fractures. In this study, we examined whether an ACE inhibitor might attenuate osteoporosis in a hypertensive rat model. In spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHRs), estrogen deficiency induced by ovariectomy (OVX) resulted in a significant increase in osteoclast activation as assessed by the tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity in the tibia, accompanied by a significant decrease in bone density evaluated by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and an increase in urinary deoxypyridinoline. Treatment with an ACE inhibitor, imidapril, attenuated OVX-induced decrease in bone density and increase in TRAP activity and urinary deoxypyridinoline. As ACE inhibitors possess the effects of blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and activation of the bradykinin-nitric oxide pathway, we examined the contribution of both pathways in an OVX-induced osteoporosis model. Administration of nitro-L-arginine methylester (L-NAME) did not alter TRAP activity, urinary deoxypyridinoline or bone density, whereas the administration of a subpressor dose of angiotensin II accelerated the increase in TRAP activity in the tibia, accompanied by a significant decrease in bone density and an increase in urinary deoxypyridinoline. Thus, ACE inhibitors prevented osteoporosis, probably because of the inhibition of RAS, but not of nitric oxide. Overall, ACE inhibitors attenuated osteoporosis in a hypertensive rat model through the blockade of RAS.",

Clinical and demographic features were studied in patients with/without CAD who presented with LBBB on their surface electrocardiograms and had undergone coronary angiography. Of the 312 patients with LBBB, 161 (51.6%) had CAD. Patients with CAD were more likely to be older, male, have CAD risk factors and to be taking acetylsalicylic acid or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. A model with six independent variables (family history, smoking, angina, advanced age, hypertension and total cholesterol levels) was statistically significant in predicting CAD in patients with LBBB, with an ability to predict patients with and without CAD of 87.1% and 90.6%, respectively. Predictors of CAD in patients with LBBB are consistent with classical risk factors and may help the accurate prediction of patients with CAD.", 
    "237": "Failure of current pharmacological therapy for atrial fibrillation in maintaining sinus rhythm may be due to structural atrial remodeling caused by inflammation and fibrosis. Upstream therapy that interferes in the structural remodeling process may be effective in maintaining sinus rhythm. This article reviews upstream therapy in atrial fibrillation. Various prospective and retrospective studies demonstrate that upstream therapy, consisting of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, statins, fish oils, glucocorticoids, or moderate physical activity, is associated with a reduced incidence of new-onset atrial fibrillation (i.e., primary prevention) and with a reduced recurrence of atrial fibrillation (i.e., secondary prevention). Larger clinical trials are required to further elucidate the position of upstream therapy in the primary and secondary prevention of atrial fibrillation.", 
    "238": "High blood pressure (BP) is a major risk factor for heart disease, stroke, congestive heart failure, and kidney disease. Inverse associations between dairy product consumption and systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) have been observed in cross-sectional studies; some studies, however, have reported an inverse association with only one BP parameter, predominantly SBP. Randomized clinical trials examining the effect of calcium and the combination of calcium, potassium and magnesium provide evidence for causality. In these studies, reductions in BP were generally modest (-1.27 to -4.6 mmHg for SBP, and -0.24 to -3.8 mmHg for DBP). Dairy nutrients, most notably calcium, potassium and magnesium, have been shown to have a blood pressure lowering effect. A low calcium intake increases intracellular calcium concentrations which increases 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) and parathyroid hormone (PTH), causing calcium influx into vascular smooth muscle cells, resulting in greater vascular resistance. New research indicates that dairy peptides may act as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thereby inhibiting the renin angiotensin system with consequent vasodilation. A growing evidence base shows that dairy product consumption is involved in the regulation of BP. Consequently, inclusion of dairy products in a heart healthy diet is an important focal point to attain BP benefits.",

Two weeks after coronary artery ligation, rats were divided into groups of similar average MI size, measured by echocardiography, and the following 12-month treatments were initiated: fenoterol (250 microg/kg/day), a beta2-AR agonist, plus metoprolol (100 mg/kg/day), a beta1-AR blocker (beta1-beta2+); metoprolol plus enalapril (20 mg/kg/day), an ACEi (beta1-ACEi); and a combination of all three drugs (beta1-beta2+ACEi).

The 12-month mortality was significantly reduced in all treatment groups (44% in beta1-beta2+, 56% in beta1-beta2+ACEi, 59% in beta1-ACEi versus 81% in nT). Bimonthly echocardiography revealed significant attenuation of the left ventricular (LV) chamber remodeling, LV functional deterioration, and MI expansion in all three treatment groups, but effects were significantly more pronounced when treatment included a beta2-AR agonist. The results indicated that a combination of beta1-AR blocker and beta2-AR agonist is equipotent to a combination of beta1-AR blocker and ACEi in the treatment of CHF in rats, with the respect to mortality, and exceeds the latter with respect to cardiac remodeling and MI expansion.

    "292": "For fingerprint searching using multiple active reference compounds, an information entropy-based similarity method is introduced as an alternative to conventional similarity coefficients and search strategies. The approach involves the determination of the fingerprint bit pattern entropy of a compound reference set and recalculation of the entropy following the addition of individual test compounds. If a database compound shares similar bit patterns with reference set molecules, adding this compound to the reference set only produces a small change in system entropy. By contrast, inclusion of a compound having a dissimilar fingerprint leads to a notable increase in entropy. Thus, database compounds can be screened for candidate molecules that do not cause significant changes in reference set fingerprint entropy. Compared to nearest neighbor methods, this approach has the computational advantage that it extracts reference set information only once prior to similarity searching. Test calculations on different compound data sets, fingerprints, and screening databases reveal that the ability of our entropy-based method to detect active compounds is often superior to data fusion techniques and Tanimoto similarity calculations.",

Evaluation of the use of cardiovascular medications is important to determine the magnitude of the growth, to identify which medications dominate the landscape and to detect interprovincial differences in utilization. We describe long-term trends in the use of and expenditures for cardiovascular medications in Canada, by drug class and by province.",

Changes in population demographics, risk factors and inflation appeared to account for about two-thirds of the observed growth in expenditures. Use of newer medication classes (statins, angiotensin-receptor blockers, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors), for which patented brand name medications predominate, accounted for almost one-third of the cost increases. Interprovincial differences in total expenditures for cardiovascular drugs portrayed a descending gradient from east to west, with greatest variability for the newer drug classes.",

DPP-IV inhibitors also decrease degradation of peptides, such as substance P, that may be involved in the pathogenesis of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-associated angioedema. This study tested the hypothesis that DPP-IV inhibition affects risk of clinical angioedema, by comparing the incidence of angioedema in patients treated with the DPP-IV inhibitor vildagliptin versus those treated with comparator in Phase III randomized clinical trials. Prospectively defined angioedema-related events were adjudicated in a blinded fashion by an internal medicine adjudication committee and expert reviewer. Concurrent ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker exposure was ascertained from case report forms. Study drug exposure was ascertained from unblinded data from phase III studies. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals comparing angioedema risk in vildagliptin-treated and comparator-treated patients were calculated for the overall population and for patients taking ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, using both an analysis of pooled data and a meta-analysis (Peto method). Overall, there was no association between vildagliptin use and angioedema. Among individuals taking an ACE inhibitor, however, vildagliptin use was associated with an increased risk of angioedema (14 confirmed cases among 2754 vildagliptin users versus 1 case among 1819 comparator users: odds ratio 4.57 [95% confidence interval 1.57 to 13.28]) in the meta-analysis. Vildagliptin use may be associated with increased risk of angioedema among patients taking ACE inhibitors, although absolute risk is small. Physicians confronted with angioedema in a patient taking an ACE inhibitor and DPP-IV inhibitor should consider this possible drug-drug interaction.",

The animals, divided into 4 groups (saline, morphine, captopril and Ang II) were placed in self-administration apparatus and were allowed to self-administer morphine (0.5 mg per infusion all test groups) or saline (saline group) during consecutive days, for 2 h/sessions. Captopril (30 microg) and Ang II (0.25 nM) were injected into NAC in the corresponding groups before each session. In morphine group, the number of active lever pressing was significantly higher than passive during all 5 days and was also significantly higher than saline group. In captopril group, there were no significant differences between the number of active and passive lever pressings. However, the number of active lever pressing was significantly lower than morphine group. The results highlight the interaction between captopril and opioid system in NAC.", 
    "304": "The aetiology of aortic aneurysms (AAs) is the subject of intense clinical investigation. One of the critical points in their pathogenesis is the disruption of the balance between vascular extracellular matrix deposition and degradation. AAs are common features in some genetically determined diseases of the connective tissue, such as Marfan and Loeys-Dietz Syndromes. Acquired factors determining an enhanced inflammatory state of the arterial wall also play a key role. Previous studies have determined the role of TGF-beta as the principal mediator of the pathogenesis of the alterations of the arterial wall homeostasis in aneurysms. The current medical management of any AA is mainly focused on the use of pharmacological agents that reduce hemodynamic stress of aortic wall, since hypertension is the major risk factor for the enlargement and rupture of the AAs. Thus, this approach is useful to reduce the risk of aneurysm rupture but is far from being a comprehensive pathophysiology-based therapeutic approach. Drugs with the potential of reducing the action of TGF-beta, which activation and expression has been reported to have a major role in the molecular pathogenesis of the aneurysms, improving matrix repair, decreasing the proteolytic pattern and inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme as well as preventing angiotensin II-induced AT1R (angiotensin type 1 receptor) activation, can represent new options in the medical therapy of AAs. We propose that a combination of statins and PPAR-gamma agonist could be a useful adjunctive therapy in this condition. The new pathophysiology-based therapeutic approach, involving the pathological patterns and mechanisms leading to the rupture of the AAs, could represent an interesting additional tool in combination with the current established anti-hypertensive therapy.", 
    "305": "In 40% of children with symptomatic idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC), medical therapy fails within 2 years of diagnosis. Strong evidence-based therapies are not available for these children, and how evidence-based therapies for adults with IDC should be applied to children is unclear. Using data from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's Pediatric Cardiomyopathy Registry, we compared practice patterns of initial therapies for children with IDC diagnosed from 1990 to 1995 (n = 350) and from 2000 to 2006 (n = 219). At diagnosis, 73% had symptomatic heart failure (HF), and 7% had > or =1 family member with IDC. Anti-HF medications were most commonly prescribed initially. Anti-HF medication use was similar across the 2 periods (84% and 87%, respectively), as was angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor use (66% and 70%, respectively). These medications were used more commonly in children with greater left ventricular dilation and poorer left ventricular fractional shortening and functional class (p <0.001). Beta-blocker use was 4% to 18% over the 2 periods. Treatments for pediatric IDC have changed little over the previous 25 years. Anti-HF medications remain the most common treatment, and they are often given to children with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction. Children with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction are often not offered angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors without echocardiographic evidence of advanced disease. In conclusion, therapeutic clinical trials are strongly indicated because practice variation is substantial and medical outcomes in these children have not improved in the previous several decades.", 
    "306": "Previous clinical trials have shown that alpha(1)-adrenergic antagonists are not effective in subjects with heart failure (HF) and might increase HF rates when used for hypertension. However, alpha(1)-adrenergic antagonists may be prescribed to subjects with HF who have symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia. We sought to determine any association between alpha(1)-adrenergic antagonist use, commonly prescribed for benign prostatic hyperplasia, and the clinical outcomes of subjects with HF receiving contemporary therapy. An existing database of 388 subjects with decompensated HF admissions from 2002 to 2004 at the Veterans Affairs Hospital was analyzed according to the use of alpha(1)-adrenergic antagonists at discharge. Covariate-adjusted Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine any association with future admissions for decompensated HF and total mortality. Alpha-1-adrenergic antagonist therapy was prescribed in 25% of our HF population, predominantly for benign prostatic hyperplasia, and was not associated with significant increases in the combined risk of all-cause mortality and rehospitalization for HF (hazard ratio 1.24, 95% confidence interval 0.93 to 1.65, p = 0.14), HF hospitalization (hazard ratio 1.20, 95% confidence interval 0.85 to 1.70, p = 0.31), or all-cause mortality (hazard ratio 1.10, 95% confidence interval 0.78 to 1.56, p = 0.57). In patients not receiving beta-blocker therapy, alpha(1)-adrenergic antagonist therapy was significantly associated with increased HF hospitalizations (hazard ratio 1.94, 95% confidence interval 1.14 to 3.32, p = 0.015). In conclusion, in patients with chronic HF, the use of alpha(1)-adrenergic antagonists was significantly associated with more HF hospitalizations when prescribed without concomitant beta blockade. Thus, background beta-blocker therapy appears to be protective against the potential harmful effects of alpha(1)-adrenergic antagonist therapy in patients with HF.", 
    "307": "Use of evidence-based medicine (EBM) improves outcomes after acute coronary syndromes (ACS), yet patients often discontinue prescribed therapies after discharge. Although such discontinuation is well documented, patients' reasons for medication discontinuation have not been reported. MAINTAIN is a longitudinal follow-up registry of CRUSADE/ACTION, which enrolled patients during an ACS hospitalization from January 2006 to September 2007. All discharge medications were obtained from hospital charts. Patients were interviewed by telephone 3 months after discharge to determine if EBM classes prescribed at discharge were continued (aspirin, clopidogrel, beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, and lipid-lowering medications). If discontinuation occurred, patients were asked if it was with provider knowledge/input or not (self-discontinuation). A multivariable logistic regression model was performed to identify factors associated with self-discontinuation of prescribed EBM. Of the 1,077 patients interviewed, 1,006 (93.4%) were discharged on aspirin, 816 (75.8%) on clopidogrel, 982 (91.2%) on beta blockers, 745 (69.2%) on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, and 968 (89.9%) on lipid-lowering medications. At 3-month follow-up, 304 patients (28.2%) had discontinued > or =1 of these prescribed EBM classes. Although many reported provider involvement, most discontinuation (61.5%) was self-determined. Factors independently associated with self-discontinuation were no pharmacy coinsurance, increasing number of medications, not using reminder tools (e.g., pillbox), lower education, and dialysis. In conclusion, 1/3 of patients with ACS discontinue > or =1 of their prescribed EBMs within 3 months of hospital discharge, and most of this discontinuation is without provider involvement. Patient education, better prescription drug coverage, and reminder strategies may improve use of EBMs at 3 months after discharge from ACS admission.", 
    "308": "Concern has been raised about combining beta blockers with angiotensin-receptor blockers in patients with heart failure. The VALsartan In Acute myocardial infarction (VALIANT) trial enrolled 14,703 patients with myocardial infarction complicated by heart failure or documented left ventricular systolic dysfunction. These patients were randomly allocated to treatment with valsartan, captopril, or both. Physicians were also encouraged to prescribe beta blockers because of previous evidence of benefit. The baseline characteristics, treatments, and outcomes were compared among 4 groups: patients taking beta blockers at admission only, at discharge only, at both admission and discharge, and neither. Patients treated with beta blockers were at lower risk than those not treated at any period. Those treated with beta blockers at both intervals had a lower 3-year mortality rate (17.7%) than those treated only at randomization (30.7%) or only at discharge (25.9%). The greatest mortality (35.1%) occurred in patients not treated at either point. No statistically significant interaction with prognosis was observed between beta-blocker use and treatment with valsartan or valsartan plus captopril. Patients discharged with a beta blocker had a significant survival advantage after adjustment for differences in baseline characteristics and intervening complications (hazard ratio 0.89, 95% confidence interval 0.81 to 0.98, p = 0.02). This association was most pronounced in patients prescribed consistent beta blockers at randomization and discharge and was present in both patients with impaired and those with preserved systolic left ventricular function. These results have further confirmed that beta blockers reduce the risk of death and nonfatal cardiovascular events in patients with heart failure or systolic left ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction. In conclusion, no evidence was found of adverse interactions between the angiotensin-receptor blocker valsartan and beta blockers or of a negative effect of the combination of valsartan, captopril, and beta blockers.", 
    "309": "Aortic stenosis (AS) will likely become increasingly frequent with the aging of the American population. The difficulties in treating elderly patients with critical AS emphasize the potential value of a strategy to slow the advancement of aortic valve calcification. Recent prospective trials of statins and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been disappointing. New options are needed to achieve a truly effective strategy for retarding the advancement of AS. In this context, the observations of Skolnick et al appearing in this issue of The American Journal of Cardiology are particularly intriguing. In a retrospective review of patients followed for mild or moderate AS, these investigators found that 18 patients receiving treatment for osteoporosis had significantly less decrement in aortic valve area on follow-up echocardiography than 37 not receiving such treatment. The most attractive explanation is an action of drug therapy for osteoporosis, most often bisphosphonates, to retard aortic valve calcification. The mechanism for this action is not clear, although numerous possibilities can be postulated on the basis of the multiple complex processes controlling tissue calcification. In conclusion, the investigators' findings deserve further study to clarify drug impact on aortic valve calcification as well as confirm the clinical findings in a larger and more diverse population. Such investigation should also assess the role of vitamin D and calcium supplementation, common features of treatment for osteoporosis. Currently available results are too preliminary to justify the use of bisphosphonates or other osteoporosis therapies to slow the progression of AS.", 
    "310": "Development of left ventricular (LV) remodeling after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a serious medical complication. We investigated the correlation of LV dyssynchrony after AMI with LV remodeling using magnetic resonance-myocardial tagging (MR-MT) derived dyssynchrony index (circumferential uniformity ratio estimate [CURE]). Forty-three patients diagnosed with ST-elevation AMI were analyzed. After treatment with primary percutaneous intervention, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was performed to obtain a cine image, a delayed enhancement image, and an MR-MT image. CURE as a dyssynchrony index was calculated from the MR-MT image using HARP software (CURE 0 to 1 = dyssynchrony to synchrony). After 6 months, follow-up cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was performed to assess degree of LV remodeling. Sixteen patients (37%) had an increased LV end-systolic volume (ESV) >15% compared with baseline. The baseline LV dyssynchrony index, CURE, was significantly associated with ESV at 6 months (r = -0.49, p <0.001) and weakly correlated with change in ESV (percentage) compared with baseline values (r = -0.26, p = 0.08). Multivariate analysis showed that CURE was associated only with change in ESV (beta -0.39, p = 0.03). Subgroup analysis for patients with nonviable myocardium (infarct thickness >75%, n = 31) showed that this correlation was stronger (beta -0.52, p = 0.006), suggesting that CURE could predict progression of LV remodeling in patients with AMI and nonviable myocardium. LV dyssynchrony immediately after AMI is an important determinant of LV remodeling. In conclusion, the MR-MT dyssynchrony index, CURE, might be useful for prediction of LV remodeling in patients with AMI.",

Milled whole grain, bran, shorts, and red dog acquired ACE inhibitory activity though water soaking treatment. Among the milled fractions, the preparation of shorts exhibited the strongest inhibitory activity (IC50 = 0.08 mg protein/mL) followed by that of bran, red dog, and whole grain in decreasing order. The production of ACE inhibitory peptides was almost completely inhibited by pepstatin A, indicating the contribution of aspartic proteases. The optimal pH for acquiring ACE inhibitory activity of the byproduct fraction (mixtures of bran and shorts) was 3.2. The level of inhibitory activity rose with increasing temperature up to 40 degrees C. The inhibitory activity reached a maximal level after a 12 h reaction time and maintained the same level up to 24 h at 40 degrees C, pH 3.2. From the hydrolysate of the byproduct fraction, six peptides were isolated by several steps of chromatography, and their amino acid sequences were Leu-Gln-Pro, Ile-Gln-Pro, Leu-Arg-Pro, Val-Tyr, Ile-Tyr, and Thr-Phe.

    "326": "Development of fetal kidney is a finely programmed sequence, and is regulated by many important molecules. The perturbation of normal kidney development leads to congenital anomalies of kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT). CAKUT includes hypoplastic/dysplastic kidney, obstructive nephropathy and several other anomalies. CAKUT is of clinically importance, since it could lead to end stage renal failure when its anomaly grade is severe. So far, several causative genes responsible for development of CAKUT have been identified, including genes encoding molecules related to the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, RAS system.

    "340": "Bone metabolism is closely regulated by hormones and cytokines, which have effects on both bone resorption and deposition. Since renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been known to play an important role to regulate remodeling in several tissues, we focused on the potential role of RAS in bone metabolism. It is known that the receptors of angiotensin II are expressed in culture osteoclasts and osteoblasts, and angiotensin II induced the differentiation and activation of osteoclasts responsible for bone resorption. Of importance, angiotensin II significantly induced the expression of RANKL (receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand) in osteoblasts, leading to the activation of osteoclasts, while these effects were completely blocked by an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockade. In a rat ovariectomy model of estrogen deficiency, administration of angiotensin II accelerated the increase in TRAP activity, accompanied by a significant decrease in bone density and an increase in urinary deoxypyridinoline. As it has been known that osteoclast differentiation is regulated by a variety of hormones, local factors and inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1 and TNF-alpha, RAS might also be involved in this autocrine system. Of importance, sub-analysis of recent clinical study demonstrated that the usage of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors significantly reduced the fracture risk. RAS might be a novel target to treat the subgroups of hypertensive patients with osteoporosis.", 
    "341": "The aim of this work was to study the role of hypovolemia on pathogenesis of arterial hypertension (AH) in patients with primary hypothyroidism (PH) and specification of indirect signs indicative of increased circulating blood volume. 217patients with PH and AH (mean age 53.3 yr) received substitution therapy with sodium levothyroxin and standard hypotensive therapy with ACE inhibitors. All the patients allocated to 3 groups were examined by 24 hour Holter monitoring and measurement of serum TSH and free T4. Group 1 (n = 74) were patients with compensated PH, group 2 (n = 57) comprised patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, group 3 (n = 86) were patients with decompensated hypothyroidism. The latter group was dominated by non-dippers, the patients showed elevated systolic and diastolic AD, its small reduction and high variability at night time. These clinical and functional signs are supposed to reflect hypovolemia in patients with PH and concomitant AH.", 
    "342": "NMR-based metabolomics of mouse urine was used in conjunction with the traditional staining and imaging of aortas for the characterization of disease advancement, that is, plaque formation in untreated and drug-treated apolipoprotein-E (apoE) knockout mice. The metabolomics approach with multivariate analysis was able to differentiate the captopril-treated from the untreated mice in general agreement with the staining results. Principal component analysis showed a pattern shift in both the drug-treated and untreated samples as a function of time that could possibly be explained as the effect of aging. Allantoin, a marker attributed to captopril treatment was elevated in the drug-treated mice. From partial least squares-discriminant analysis, xanthine and ascorbate were elevated in the untreated mice and were possible markers of plaque formation in the apoE knockout mice. Several additional peaks in the spectra characterizing the study endpoint were found but their respective metabolite identities were unknown.",

    "344": "We undertook two studies: an analysis of records of the anti-hypertensive drugs supplied to all 54 public-sector hospitals with a hypertension clinic in KwaZulu-Natal, and a direct-observation survey of anti-hypertensive drug prescriptions presented to pharmacies in a subset of 16 of the 54 hospitals. We calculated the relative use of each anti-hypertensive drug group as a proportion of all anti-hypertensive drugs supplied or prescribed. We ranked drug groups in order of use for comparison with recommended South African standard treatment guidelines, and we compared the proportions derived from supply data with those derived from the prescription survey.", 
    "345": "Supply data showed that, in line with treatment guidelines, diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were the most frequently supplied medicines (42% and 27%, respectively). However, methyldopa - not included in the treatment guidelines - represented 10% of all anti-hypertensives supplied, but the proportion varied widely between hospitals (0-37%). Reserpine, second choice in the treatment guidelines, was used in high amounts by only two hospitals. Calcium channel blockers and beta blockers represented a small proportion of the anti-hypertensive drugs supplied: 6% each. Results from the prescription survey were in concordance with supply data for the most frequently prescribed drugs but gave slightly different estimates of the use of others.",

    "351": "Chronic renal ischemia and hypoxia in the tubulointerstitium are involved in the mechanisms of progressive chronic kidney disease. Previous studies showed that the decoction of a combination of two Chinese herbs, Astragalus membmnaceus var. mongholicus and Angelica sinensis (A & A) has antifibrotic effects through multiple pathways in different animal models. In this study, remnant kidney model was employed to investigate whether A & A affect the expression of VEGF, the density of the renal microvasculature and thus alleviate the renal injury. Rats were divided randomly into four groups: sham group (N-31), 5/6 Nx group (5/ 6 nephrectomy, N=43), A & A treated group (A & A group, N=40, A & A 12 g/kg/d po), enalapril treated group (Ena group, N=56, enalapril 4 mg/kg/d po). Rats from each group were sacrificed at the 2th, 4th, 8th and 12th weeks respectively after surgery and treatment The 24 h urinary protein excretion, serum creatinine (Scr) and urea were measured. The collagen IV (COL-IV), fibronectin (FN), aminopeptidase P (APP) and VEGF were stained using immunohistochemistry. The COL-IV, FN and APP were semi-quantitatively analyzed. Peritubular capillary density in the cortical interstitial area was quantified. The level of VEGF was assayed by ELISA. The results revealed that Scr, urea and urinary protein excretion remained constant at each time point in sham group. Compared to sham group, 5/6 Nx group was shown severe glomerulosclerosis, tubulointerstitial lesions and vascular damage, as well as higher level of Scr from the 2nd week (72.3 +/- 5.2 vs. 48.6 +/- 2.6 micromol/L P < 0.05) to the 12th week (71.9 +/- 8.0 vs. 55.7 +/- 4.5 micromol/L P < 0.05). Although there was no significant difference in Scr level after treatment of enalapril or A & A (P > 0.05), kidney damage was alleviated at the 8th and the 12th week in the two treatment groups (P < 0.05, vs. 5/6 Nx group). The urinary protein excretion of 5/6 Nx group was significantly increased from the 4th week, it was 1.5, 2.4 and 3.8 fold of that of sham group at the 4th, 8th and 12th week, respectively. Compared to 5/6 Nx group, proteinuria was decreased by enalapril to 59%, 33% at 8th and 12th week. After A & A administration, urinary protein excretion decreased to 66%, 56%, 75%, 55% of 5/6 Nx group at the 2nd, 4th, 8th and 12th, respectively (P < 0.05). Compared with sham group, there was increased expression of FN and COL-IV in rats with 5/6 Nx. After A & A or enalapril administration, the expression of FN and COL-IV was significantly decreased compared with that in the 5/6 Nx group at 8th and 12th week (P < 0.05). On the other hand, the capillary density was decreased at the 8th and 12th week in 5/6 Nx rats (P < 0.01). In A & A-treated group, similarly with enalapril group, the amount of APP-positive glomerular capillary increased by 36% (P < 0.01), and the peritubular capillary density was increased 94% at 8th week and 52% at 12th week compared with 5/6 Nx group (P < 0.05). The renal level of VEGF was decreased in 5/6 Nx rats, but increased at the 8th and 12th week in A & A group (P < 0.05, vs. 5/6 Nx group). In conclusion, A & A has renoprotective effects by suppression of extra cellular matrix deposition in 5/6 Nx rat. The renoprotective effects may be associated with reduction of proteinuria, up-regulation of VEGF which may reduce the loss of capillaries and improve microstructure dysfunction.", 
    "352": "Angioedema due to use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) is a rare side-effect but is seen more often because of the increase in the use of these drugs due to their effectiveness and good tolerance in the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure. Other types of angioedema, which should be included in the differential diagnosis, are the hereditary type, which results from deficiency of C1 esterase inhibitor and the allergic angioedema. Angioedema is a potentially life-threatening condition when it is located to the mucosal and submucosal layers of the upper airway. Some times an angioedema case can be very severe, resistant to the usual treatment and even rarely fatal. The last eight months, six patients with angioedema due to ACEIs (5 cases) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (1 case), were examined and hospitalized at our department. We describe the case of a 65 year old woman with severe migratory angioedema of the tongue, the floor of the mouth and the oropharynx, which was rather resistant to the usual treatment.", 
    "353": "Proteinuria, that is, more than 200 mg/day of urinary albumin, is associated with the presence of kidney disease. Its increase over time is strongly correlated with progression of nephropathy. Retrospective analyses of nephropathy outcome trials show that proteinuria reduction of 30% or more after initiation of blood pressure (BP)-lowering therapy is associated with slower nephropathy progression than lowering BP without its reduction.", 
    "354": "Retrospective analyses of five large nephropathy outcome trials demonstrate that nephropathy progression slowed by an additional 28-39% over the control or placebo group when proteinuria was reduced in concert with BP. Two separate trials demonstrate that nephropathy progression was slowed to a lesser degree when BP was reduced to a similar degree, but proteinuria reduced less than 30%. These associations do not hold for those with microalbuminuria, in which BP reduction is the key element to slowing nephropathy progression. Recent cardiovascular outcome trials fail to show a relationship between reductions in proteinuria and nephropathy outcomes. This large cardiovascular endpoint trial, however, was not only powered for nephropathy outcomes but also failed to show a benefit between proteinuria reduction and cardiovascular events, a previously established observation.", 
    "355": "All patients with a history of hypertension and either kidney disease or diabetes should have an annual check for albuminuria. If albumin is present in amounts of more than 200 mg/day, strategies for BP-lowering therapy should also focus on a reduction of more than 30% of urinary protein.",

Adherence to guideline-recommended medications decreased over time, with 3-year medication continuation rates of 44%, 48%, and 43% for statins, beta-blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers, respectively. Enrollment in a cardiac rehabilitation program was associated with an improved likelihood of continuing medications, with adjusted hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) for discontinuation of statins and beta-blockers among cardiac rehabilitation participants of 0.66 (0.45-0.92) and 0.70 (0.49-0.98), respectively. Smoking at the time of myocardial infarction was associated with a decreased likelihood of continuing medications, although results did not reach statistical significance. There were no observed associations between demographic characteristics, clinical characteristics of the myocardial infarction, and medication adherence.",

    "360": "A rapid, simple, and sensitive headspace solid phase microextraction coupled to ion mobility spectrometry (HS-SPME-IMS) method is presented for analysis of the highly specific angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, captopril (CAP). Positive ion mobility spectra of CAP were acquired with an ion mobility spectrometer equipped with a corona discharge ionization source. Mass-to-mobility correlation equation was used to identify product ions. A dodecylsulfate-doped polypyrrole (PPy-DS) coating was used as a fiber for SPME. The results showed that PPy-DS based SPME fiber was suitable for successfully extracting CAP from human blood plasma and pharmaceutical samples. The HS-SPME-IMS method provided good repeatability (R.S.D.s<4%) for aqueous and spiked plasma samples. The calibration graphs were linear in the range of 10-300 ng mL(-1) (R(2)>0.99) and detection limits were 7.5 ng mL(-1) for aqueous and 6.3 ng mL(-1) for plasma blank samples. Finally, a standard addition calibration method was applied to HS-SPME-IMS technique for the analysis of blood plasma samples and tablets. Purpose method seemed to be suitable for the analysis of CAP in plasma samples as it is not time consuming (state total time from sample preparation to analysis), it required only small quantities of the sample, and no derivatization was required.", 
    "361": "A new simple, sensitive and selective liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC/MS) method for quantification of captopril after precolumn derivatization with p-bromo-phenacyl-bromide in human plasma was validated. Plasma samples were analysed on a monolithic column (Cromolith Performance-RP 18e, 100 mm x 4.6 mm I.D., 3 microm) under isocratic conditions using a mobile phase of a 40:60 (v/v) mixture of acetonitrile and 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in water. The flow rate was 1 mL/min at the column temperature of 30 degrees C. In these chromatographic conditions, the retention time was 4.4 min for captopril derivative. The detection of the analyte was in MRM mode using an ion trap mass spectrometer with electrospray positive ionisation. The monitored ions were 216, 253, 255, 268, 270 m/z derived from 415 m/z for derivatized captopril. The sample preparation was very simple and consisted in plasma protein precipitation from 0.2 mL plasma using 0.3 mL methanol after the derivatization reaction was completed. Calibration curves were generated over the range of 10-3000 ng/mL with values for coefficient of correlation greater than 0.993 and by using a weighted (1/y(2)) quadratic regression. The values for precision (CV %) and accuracy (relative error %) at quantification limit were less than 9.9% and 3.9%, for within- and between-run, respectively. The mean recovery of the analyte was 99%. Derivatized samples demonstrated good short-term, long-term, post-preparative and freeze-thaw stability. This is the first reported LC-MS/MS method for analysis of captopril in human plasma that uses protein precipitation as sample processing procedure. The method is very simple and allows obtaining a very good recovery of the analyte. The validated LC-MS/MS method has been applied to a pharmacokinetic study of 50mg captopril tablets on healthy volunteers.", 
    "362": "A number of previous investigators have demonstrated that arterial augmentation index (AIx), a measure of apparent arterial stiffness, reflects in part vascular endothelial function, and that AIx is modulated by nitric oxide (NO) responses. We evaluated AIx in a population of 253 ageing subjects (mean age 63.4+/-6 (standard deviation, SD) years) and its relationship to (i) plasma levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), a marker and mediator of vascular endothelial dysfunction and (ii) the ratio of ADMA to its non-metabolised enantiomer symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA), an inverse index of ADMA metabolic clearance. Evaluation was performed by univariate followed by multivariate analyses. On multivariate analyses, both ADMA (beta=0.16, p=0.01) and ADMA:SDMA (beta=0.21, p<0.001) ratio were significant direct correlates of AIx. Other significant correlates of AIx on multivariate analysis were: use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin-receptor blockers (ACEi/ARB) (beta=-0.24, p=0.004), smoking history (beta=0.15, p=0.007), male gender (beta=-0.38, p<0.001), creatinine clearance (CrCL) (beta=-0.25, p<0.001), and history of hypertension (beta=0.17, p=0.04). We conclude that (1) endothelial dysfunction engendered by impairment of NO synthesis may represent the basis for increased arterial stiffness in ageing individuals and (2) the fundamental biochemical anomaly may be impairment of ADMA clearance. These pathophysiological factors are likely to be relevant to optimize therapy to ameliorate disorders of arterial compliance in the ageing population.", 
    "363": "This study was designed to determine if a viable biodegradable three-dimensional fibroblast construct (3DFC) patch implanted on the left ventricle after myocardial infarction (MI) improves left ventricular (LV) function and blood flow. We ligated the left coronary artery of adult male Sprague-Dawley rats and implanted the 3DFC at the time of the infarct. Three weeks after MI, the 3DFC improved LV systolic function by increasing (p < 0.05) ejection fraction (37 +/- 3% to 62 +/- 5%), increasing regional systolic displacement of the infarcted wall (0.04 +/- 0.02 to 0.11 +/- 0.03 cm), and shifting the passive LV diastolic pressure volume relationship toward the pressure axis. The 3FDC improved LV remodeling by decreasing (p < 0.05) LV end-systolic and end-diastolic diameters with no change in LV systolic pressure. The 3DFC did not change LV end-diastolic pressure (LV EDP; 25 +/- 2 vs. 23 +/- 2 mmHg) but the addition of captopril (2mg/L drinking water) lowered (p < 0.05) LV EDP to 12.9 +/- 2.5 mmHg and shifted the pressure-volume relationship toward the pressure axis and decreased (p < 0.05) the LV operating end-diastolic volume from 0.49 +/- 0.02 to 0.34 +/- 0.03 ml. The 3DFC increased myocardial blood flow to the infarcted anterior wall after MI over threefold (p < 0.05). This biodegradable 3DFC patch improves LV function and myocardial blood flow 3 weeks after MI. This is a potentially new approach to cell-based therapy for heart failure after MI.", 
    "364": "Pharmacotherapy remains the cornerstone in the treatment of heart failure. There is a wide variability in the individual's response to treatment, which is at least partially ascribed to genetic factors. Pharmacogenetics studies the differential clinical effects due to genetic variances. Some effects of the major neurohormonal inhibitors like angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors and beta-blockers are importantly modulated by genetic polymorphisms. So far, however, this does not result in standard genetic testing before starting specific therapy. This review discusses several important pharmacogenetic targets. Furthermore, it is argued that new and sophisticated high-throughput genetic screens could be employed to develop pharmacogenetic screening further. Prospective large-scale pharmacogenetic studies are warranted as we believe that they will identify new targets for therapy and specific populations that benefit from specific treatments.",

By multivariate analysis, independent predictors of progression were FEIgG, sCr and no ACEi treatment. Proteinuria reduction from -100% to -30%, spontaneous or after ACEi treatment, did not affect progression in treated vs. untreated patients (19% vs. 13%, p=0.85). Patients with proteinuria increased or reduced <30% showed a reduction of total progression if ACEi-treated (15% vs. 77%, p=0.0002).

In independent experimental protocols, four different groups of spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHR) were treated for 1 or 2 weeks: control, captopril (20 mg/kg/day), losartan (20 mg/kg/day), and combination captopril (10 mg/kg/day) with losartan (10 mg/kg/day). In cross-over protocols, each SHR received all four treatments for 1 or 3 days with an interval of several days between each injection for washing-out and return to high blood pressure (BP) levels. BP and heart rate (HR) were measured in conscious telemetered SHR. According to the results from the independent protocol, regardless of a 1- or 2-week administration period, combination therapy with low doses of captopril and losartan had a greater anti-hypertensive effect than individual high-dose monotherapy. Similarly, results from the cross-over protocol showed that regardless of 1-day or 3-day administration, the decrease in BP in the 11(th) and 12(th) hour after administration was greatest with the combination of low-dose captopril and losartan.

To that end, we optimized and validated an analytical method based on on-line solid-phase extraction (on-line SPE) coupled with reversed-phase liquid chromatography-switching polarity electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI(+/-)-MS/MS). The target analytes have a variable hydrophobic character and belong to various therapeutic classes including the lipid regulator bezafibrate, the chemotherapy drugs methotrexate and cyclophosphamide, the lipase inhibitor orlistat and the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor used in the treatment of hypertension, enalapril. The method combines positive and negative voltage switching modes, therefore all analytes can be determined using a single injection and without any reduction in sensitivity. In order to detect traces of these compounds, a preconcentration step before detection is performed by loading 1.00 mL of sample in an on-line SPE cartridge and eluting from the cartridge using a reversed-phase liquid chromatography gradient. Analysis of wastewater and surface water samples was greatly affected by co-eluting matrix compounds, to compensate for matrix effects quantitation was therefore performed using standard additions. Method intra-day precision was less than 6.5% and limits of detection in fortified matrix effluent samples ranged from 9 to 20 ng L(-1). Four of the target pharmaceuticals were detected in the WWTP effluents, enalapril and bezafibrate being the most abundant compounds with concentrations of 35 and 239 ng L(-1), respectively. Concentrations of these same compounds in surface water samples from sites downstream in the St. Lawrence River were 8 and 63 ng L(-1), respectively, which was mainly due to dilution.",

    "377": "Hypertensive patients with low-baseline plasma renin activity (PRA) are known to respond best to natriuretic drugs, and those with high PRA respond best to renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockade. However, there has been recent speculation that blood pressure (BP)-lowering responses to the renin inhibitor, aliskiren, might also be blunted in some patients with medium-to-high baseline PRA. It has been suggested that treatment resistance in these patients may result from excessive reactive increases in renin secretion, such that aliskiren's blockade of PRA is overwhelmed. In order to test for evidence in support of this hypothesis, we conducted a reanalysis of original data from three published clinical trials of aliskiren. When aliskiren was administered as a monotherapy, or in combination with other blockers of the RAS, changes in PRA were closely correlated with baseline PRA. Patients with low-baseline PRA demonstrated small reductions or rises in PRA, rather than patients with medium-to-high baseline PRA. We confirmed that ambulatory BP-lowering responses to full dose aliskiren monotherapy were greatest and least among patients with high- and low-baseline PRA, respectively. However no such association was demonstrated during aliskiren combination therapy. With either monotherapy or combination therapy, no patient with a baseline PRA >0.65 ng/ml/h was observed to have a rise in both PRA and BP. We conclude, therefore, that there is only evidence for one type of resistance to aliskiren--as with all blockers of the RAS, lesser BP-lowering responses to aliskiren occur in those with the least renin to block.", 
    "378": "A commonality among the chemically disparate compounds that inhibit the formation and accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) or their signalling pathways is their end organ protection in experimental models of diabetes complications. Although this group of therapeutics are structurally and functionally distinct with numerous mechanisms of action, the most important factor governing their therapeutic capability is clearly their ability to alleviate the tissue burden of advanced glycation, rather than the biochemical mechanism by which this is achieved. However, it remains to be determined if it is the reduction in tissue AGE levels per se or inhibition of downstream signal pathways which is ultimately required for end organ protection. For example, a number of these agents stimulate antioxidant defences, modify lipid profiles and inhibit low-grade inflammation. These novel actions emphasise the importance of further examination of the advanced glycation pathway and in particular the diverse action of these agents in ameliorating the development of diabetic complications such as nephropathy.",

    "384": "HCV-related membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis is the most common cause of hepatitis C-associated renal disease. Its treatment is still under debate and based on scant experimental evidence. The recommended therapeutic strategy depends on the severity of the kidney disease. The first-line treatment for patients with mild to moderate clinical and histological kidney damage is antiviral therapy with pegylated interferon alpha and ribavirin for 48 weeks combined with symptomatic treatment (diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers). In case of severe renal involvement (nephrotic syndrome, nephritic syndrome and/or progressive renal failure, high activity score of glomerulonephritis on light microscopy), the initial treatment may consist of sequential administration of immunosuppressive therapies (plasmapheresis, corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide) and antiviral agents, although no definitive data are yet available from the literature. B-cell depleting agents such as rituximab may be an alternative to conventional therapy in refractory or intolerant patients. Large randomized and controlled clinical trials are needed to establish guidelines for the treatment of HCV-related cryoglobulinemic glomerulonephritis.",

Patients with CAD had normal coronary flow. Coronary flow was quantified using the corrected TIMI frame count (TFC) method and serum levels of gamma-glutamyltransferase were measured. The results were compared with those of a control group consisting of 86 age- and sex-matched patients who had normal coronary arteries and normal coronary flow.",

The use of medications was significantly more common in the CAD group (p<0.01). Compared to the control group, serum GGT activity was significantly increased in both SCF and CAD groups (p<0.01), but these two groups did not differ significantly in this respect (p=0.71). The TFCs for all the epicardial coronary arteries and the mean TFC were significantly higher in the SCF group (p<0.01). Patients with CAD and the controls had similar TFC parameters. The mean TFC showed a positive and moderate correlation with serum GGT activity (r=0.326; p<0.001).

    "389": "The incidence of cardiovascular diseases in premenopausal women is lower than in men or postmenopausal women. This study reports the discovery of a low grade of systemic inflammation, including monocyte adhesion to arterial endothelium, elicited by menopause or estrogen depletion. Chronic treatment with low dose of 17-beta-estradiol or inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system reduced this inflammation. Using an in vitro flow chamber system with human arterial and venous endothelial cells, we found that leukocytes from healthy postmenopausal women were more adhesive to the arterial endothelium than those from premenopausal women regardless of the stimulus used on endothelial cells. Increased circulating levels of IL-8, MCP-1, RANTES, and MIP-1alpha and monocyte CD11b expression were also encountered in postmenopausal vs premenopausal subjects. This translational data led us to investigate the mechanisms in Sprague-Dawley rats. Using intravital microscopy, we imaged mesenteric arterioles and found significant increases in arteriolar leukocyte adhesion, cell adhesion molecule expression, and plasma levels of cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant (CINC/KC), MCP-1, and MIP-1alpha in 1-mo ovariectomized rats. Chronic treatment of ovariectomized rats with low dose of 17-beta-estradiol, losartan, both, or benazepril inhibited ovariectomy-induced arteriolar mononuclear leukocyte adhesion by 77%, 58%, 92%, and 65% respectively, partly by inhibition of cell adhesion molecule up-regulation and the increase in circulating chemokines. These results demonstrate that menopause and ovariectomy generate a low grade of systemic inflammation. Therefore, administration of low doses of estrogens or inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system, at early stages of estrogen deficiency, might prevent the systemic inflammation associated with menopause and decrease the risk of suffering further cardiovascular diseases.", 
    "390": "Kidney/Disease Outcome Quality Initiative (K/DOQI) guidelines recommend baseline echocardiography at the initiation of dialysis and every 3 years thereafter in patients for early detection of cardiac disease to optimize medical therapy. Because dialysis patients are at increased cardiovascular risk and thus most are already on cardioprotective medications, we hypothesize that serial screening echocardiography will not alter cardioprotective medications in dialysis patients. Retrospective analysis of medication administration of 231 dialysis patients was conducted. Patients were divided into 2 groups, those with and those without echocardiograms. Medication changes post echocardiography were compared with subjects without echocardiograms at comparable time points. The primary end point was the number of medication class changes that occurred in 2 months post echocardiography. Medication classes examined were beta blockers (BB), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ACEI/ARB), nitrates, calcium channel blockers (CCB), and statins. In the Echo group, there were 29 (19%) subjects with at least 1 medication class change post echocardiography, compared with 121 (81%) subjects without change. The number of patients on specific medication classes before and after echocardiography were BB (90 [60%] vs. 97 [65%], P=0.05), ACEI/ARB (74 [49%] vs. 82 [55%], P=0.01), nitrates (34 [23%] vs. 33 [22%], P=0.56), CCB (77 [51%] vs. 79 [53%], P=0.56), and statins (69 [46%] vs. 70 [47%], P=0.71). When compared with the No Echo group, there was no significant change in number of any medication classes. The occurrence of medication changes post echocardiography in dialysis patients is low and is not different than changes in routine care of dialysis patients without echocardiograms. Thus, serial screening echocardiography may not have added benefit to optimizing medical management of cardiovascular disease in dialysis patients. Further studies are warranted to demonstrate evidence for the use of serial screening echocardiography in this high-risk population.",

Cationic polymer quaternized poly[bis(2-chloroethyl)ether-alt-1,3-bis[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]urea] (PEPU) and anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) were used to form a homogeneous comicelle system to induce mesoporous silica spherical nanoparticles with diameters of 50-180 nm. The formation mechanism was studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), which suggested that PEPU played a cotemplate role in the synthesis process, and no mesoporous structure was generated without it. After removing the anionic surfactant, SDS, by an ion-exchange method, the cationic polymer-mesoporous silica nanoparticles were obtained.

The data was collected from 72 centres from all over India during the period of June 2007 to February 2008. A total of 251 patients of either sex and those who were newly diagnosed stage II hypertension, or those who were uncontrolled on monotherapy with or without diabetes mellitus were included in this study. Patients were prescribed with T40+A5 combination orally. Systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP) and heart rate (HR) were measured at the start and at the end of 2, 4 and 8 weeks of treatment. Primary efficacy end points were reduction in clinical SBP/ DBP from baseline to study end and number of patients achieving JNC VII goals. Tolerability was assessed by treatment-emergent adverse events. Out of 251 patients, 208 patients had completed the study (120 males and 88 females), 42 were lost to follow-up the study and one patient was withdrawn due to adverse effects. The mean age of the patients was 54.5 +/- 0.98 years for males and 52.94 +/- 1.078 years for females. Diabetes mellitus was seen in 64.9% of cases, dyslipidaemia in 2.88%, previous IHD in 7.2% cases and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in 0.50% of cases. Reduction in the mean SBP was found to be 12.08%, 18.92% and 22.90% at the end of 2, 4 and 8 weeks respectively (p < 0.001). Reduction in the mean DBP was found to be 10.09%, 14.55% and 17.19% at the end of 2, 4 and 8 weeks respectively (p < 0.001). At the end of the study it was found that 86.3% of the hypertensive patients and 70% diabetic hypertensive patients achieved the JNC VII recommended goals. The overall incidence of ADRs was 7.69% with headache (1.92%) and vertigo (1.44%), as the commonest side-effect. According to physician's assessment of efficacy and tolerability 99.5% of total cases showed good to excellent response. In the treatment of stage II hypertensive patient the FDC of T40+A5 (Telar-AM) was found to be significantly effective in the reduction of SBP as well as DBP. Overall incidence of ADRs was lower and FDC of T40+A5 is well tolerated.", 
    "393": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is a key molecule of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system which is responsible for the control of blood pressure. For over 30 years it has become the target for fighting off hypertension. Many inhibitors of the enzyme have been synthesized and used widely in medicine despite the lack of ACE structure. The last 5 years the crystal structure of ACE separate domains has been revealed, but in order to understand how the enzyme works it is necessary to study its structure in solution. We present here the cloning, overexpression in Escherichia coli, purification and structural study of the Ala(959) to Ser(1066) region (ACE_C) that corresponds to the C-catalytic domain of human somatic angiotensin-I-converting enzyme. ACE_C was purified under denatured conditions and the yield was 6 mg/l of culture. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy indicated that 1,1,1-trifluoroethanol (TFE) is necessary for the correct folding of the protein fragment. The described procedure can be used for the production of an isotopically labelled ACE(959-1066) protein fragment in order to study its structure in solution by NMR spectroscopy.",

    "395": "OBJECTIVE This prospective randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study examined the effects of sodium chloride (NaCl) supplementation on the antialbuminuric action of telmisartan with or without hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes, increased albumin excretion rate (AER), and habitual low dietary salt intake (LDS; <100 mmol sodium/24 h on two of three consecutive occasions) or high dietary salt intake (HDS; >200 mmol sodium/24 h on two of three consecutive occasions). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Following a washout period, subjects (n = 32) received 40 mg/day telmisartan for 4 weeks followed by 40 mg telmisartan plus 12.5 mg/day HCT for 4 weeks. For the last 2 weeks of each treatment period, patients received either 100 mmol/day NaCl or placebo capsules. After a second washout, the regimen was repeated with supplements in reverse order. AER and ambulatory blood pressure were measured at weeks 0, 4, 8, 14, 18, and 22. RESULTS In LDS, NaCl supplementation reduced the anti-albuminuric effect of telmisartan with or without HCT from 42.3% (placebo) to 9.5% (P = 0.004). By contrast, in HDS, NaCl supplementation did not reduce the AER response to telmisartan with or without HCT (placebo 30.9%, NaCl 28.1%, P = 0.7). Changes in AER were independent of changes in blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS The AER response to telmisartan with or without HCT under habitual low salt intake can be blunted by NaCl supplementation. By contrast, when there is already a suppressed renin angiotensin aldosterone system under habitual high dietary salt intake, the additional NaCl does not alter the AER response.", 
    "396": "Renin-angiotensin system is involved in homeostasis processes linked to renal and cardiovascular system and recently has been linked to metabolic syndrome. We analyzed the influence of long term angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril treatment in normotensive adult Wistar rats fed with standard or palatable hyperlipidic diets. Our results show that long term enalapril treatment decreases absolute food intake, serum leptin concentration and body weight gain. Moreover, in adipose tissue, enalapril treatment led to decreased ACE activity, enhanced the expression of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma, adiponectin, hormone-sensitive lipase, fatty acid synthase, catalase and superoxide dismutase resulting in prolonged life span. On the other hand, the ACE inhibitor was not able to improve the transport of leptin through the blood brain barrier or to alter the sensitivity of this hormone in the central nervous system. The effect of enalapril in decreasing body weight gain was also observed in older rats. In summary, these results extend our previous findings and corroborate data from the literature regarding the beneficial metabolic effects of enalapril and show for the first time that this ACE inhibitor prolongs life span in rats also fed with palatable hyperlipidic diet, an action probably correlated with adipose tissue metabolic modulation and body weight reduction.",

Blockers of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) are usually the basis for such treatment. Both calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) are recommended partners. There is only one end point study comparing different combinations. ACCOMPLISH compared a combination of benazepril with either amlodipine or HCTZ in patients with compelling indications for CCBs. The primary end point of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality was reduced by 20% in the benazepril/CCB arm, as were selected secondary end points. Side effects were generally more frequent with CCB than with the thiazide combinations. However, no comparative study of the ACCOMPLISH type exists for patients with compelling indications for thiazides. In summary, the evidence indicates that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi)/CCB combinations are more effective in selected high-risk patients with compelling indications for the use of CCBs than are ACEi/HCTZ combinations.

    "422": "The present study investigated the interaction between sodium loading and enalapril on renin synthesis and secretion in hydronephrotic mice. Four different experimental groups (n=10 each) were used: sham-operated animals with normal diet (control group); sodium loading (SL group); enalapril treatment with normal diet (E group), and sodium loading combined with enalapril treatment (SL+E group). The hydronephrotic left kidney was induced by unilateral ureteral ligation in mice in the latter three groups. Plasma renin concentration (PRC) in the aorta, both the left and right renal veins, tissue renin concentration (TRC) and renin mRNA levels in the kidneys were examined under different procedures. In hydronephrotic mice treated with sodium loading, PRC in the left and right renal veins was lower than that in control mice (P<0.05), and TRC and renin mRNA levels in the hydronephrotic kidney were also suppressed (P<0.05). In hydronephrotic mice treated with enalapril, there were significant increases in PRC, TRC and renin mRNA levels in the hydronephrotic and right kidneys compared to the normal control (P<0.01). In hydronephrotic animals treated with sodium loading and enalapril, the increasing response was attenuated, and PRC in the hydronephrotic vein was similar to the level in the aorta. There was an interaction between sodium loading and enalapril on renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in both hydronephrotic and normal kidneys. The mechanism in control of renin synthesis is independent of the macula densa, but the latter is critical in the control of renin secretion.",

In the first 72 h, patients were most commonly treated with intra-venous furosemide (48%), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (45%), oral furosemide (42%) and salbuta-mol (38%). Fifty-four per cent of patients were admitted to the hospital, and 20% died or were readmitted within 30 days.

Obese Zucker rats at 20 weeks of age were treated for 12 weeks with AVE7688. Vasodilation in epineurial arterioles was measured by videomicroscopy and nerve conduction velocity was measured following electrical stimulation. Treatment with AVE7688 improved vascular relaxation in response to acetylcholine and motor and sensory nerve conduction velocity. In obese Zucker rats superoxide levels and nitrotyrosine staining were elevated in the aorta and treatment corrected both conditions. Obese Zucker rats were hypoalgesic in response to a thermal stimulus and demonstrated signs of impaired tactile response and both conditions were significantly improved with treatment. Even though obese Zucker rats are normoglycemic vascular and neural dysfunctions develop with age and can be improved by treatment with AVE7688.", 
    "429": "Alport syndrome (AS) is a hereditary glomerulopathy due to abnormal composition of the glomerular basement membrane, leading to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Studies of animal models of AS have suggested a variety of potentially effective therapies, but none of these has been definitely shown to prevent or delay ESRD in human AS. Studies in Alport mice suggest that angiotensin inhibition not only has antiproteinuric effects but suppresses cytokine and collagen production as well as tubulointerstitial fibrogenesis and inflammation. For these reasons, many Alport patients are treated empirically with angiotensin antagonists. Cyclosporine may reduce proteinuria in AS, but the risk of nephrotoxic side effects complicates long-term therapy in children. Current data on the role of HMG-CoA reductase inhibition are sparse, so therapy should be limited to adults with dyslipoproteinemia. Results of some, but not all, studies suggest that bone marrow-derived cells may ameliorate disease in Alport mice. However, until experimental doubts concerning the superiority of bone-marrow transplantation over other treatments are resolved by additional investigation, human research subjects should not be exposed to cell-based therapies that may carry substantial risks. In summary, all potential therapies are off-label use in children. As a consequence, initial therapeutic trials should focus on the safety and efficiency of medical treatment, as well as the optimal timing of therapy.",

Demographic data and surgical risk quantified by the Aristotle surgical complexity level were analyzed as covariates. Renal dysfunction was defined according to the RIFLE criteria, an international consensus classification which defines three grades of increasing severity of acute kidney injury: risk (Class R), injury (Class I), and failure (Class F) based on serum creatinine values. A univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis and a propensity score were used to analyze the data. The propensity score was developed using pretreatment covariates associated with the administration of aprotinin. A multivariate logistic regression was then used with the propensity score and intraoperative measures as covariates. A P value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.",

The importance of BP as a risk factor has been further emphasized by a World Health Organization (WHO) report which identified high BP as one of the most important preventable causes of premature morbidity and mortality in developed and developing countries. There is now data available on the safety and effectiveness of different classes of BP-lowering drugs, including diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is), dihydropyridine and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCBs), beta-blockers and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs).

In this study, resistant (RH) and controlled (CH) hypertensives and normotensive patients were submitted to echocardiography, flow-mediated vasodilation, carotid intima-media wall thickness studies, renin plasma activity, and aldosterone plasma levels and plasma and urinary sodium and potassium concentrations at baseline (pre-spironolactone phase). Subsequently, for only RH and CH groups, 25 mg/d spironolactone was added to preexisting treatments over 6 months. Afterwards, these parameters were reassessed (post-spironolactone phase). The RH and CH groups achieved reductions in blood pressure (P<.001), decreases in left ventricular hypertrophy (P<.001), improved diastolic function (Kappa index RH: 0.219 and Kappa index CH: 0.392) and increases in aldosterone concentrations (P<.05). The RH group attained improved endothelium-dependent (P<.001) and independent (P=.007) function.

    "445": "The level of albumin in the urine is a predictor of heart failure in the general population and in patients with cardiovascular risk, such as those with diabetes. Mild elevations of albuminuria, in the microalbuminuria range, appear to be associated with impaired systemic endothelial function. This increases the chance of developing hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular disease, ultimately leading to heart failure. Higher levels of albuminuria, in the proteinuric range, reflect marked renal pathology, which increases cardiovascular risk due to renal function decline. In patients with established heart failure, microalbuminuria is highly prevalent (30%). Although more frequent in diastolic than systolic dysfunction, it appears to indicate a worse prognosis in the latter class. Diabetes is a multiplier of risk, probably due to bidirectional relationship between diabetes and heart failure. Treatment with drugs that intervene in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) lowers albuminuria and is associated with prevention of the onset and worsening of heart failure and other cardiovascular disorders.",

The rash involved entire upper chest, both arms, palms, and soles and was characterized as exfoliating with scattered small pustules of 1-2 mm in size. Patient was admitted with a differential diagnosis of exfoliative dermatitis versus adverse drug reaction for which her ramipril was stopped. After admission, the patient spiked a temperature of 102 degrees F with chills, the entire workup for which was negative, including blood cultures, chest x-ray, and urine analysis. She underwent skin biopsy to find the cause of her rash. With her given clinical characteristics, she was presumed to have generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP), which was later confirmed by biopsy results. She was treated with methylprednisolone to which she responded dramatically with much improvement in her rash and her fever subsided. The flare of GPP was considered to be secondary to ramipril. After reviewing the published literature, there are no published cases of ramipril-induced GPP. Captopril, a different angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, is known to cause flare of GPP. We presented this case as apart from being the first reported case of ramipril-induced GPP; clinicians and dermatologist should also be aware of this potentially serious complication of psoriasis when they start ramipril in patients with psoriasis.",

In organ bath experiments using rat aorta, Val-Phe showed ACE inhibition, while Ala-Val-Phe did not. Single oral administration (5mg/kg body weight) to spontaneously hypertensive rats led to a significant decrease in blood pressure for both peptides. Docking experiments indicated an active character for Val-Phe and an inactive character for Ala-Val-Phe as potential inhibitors of human ACE. From our results, it can be suggested that after oral administration of Ala-Val-Phe, Val-Phe is released by in vivo peptidases and is responsible for in vivo activity of Ala-Val-Phe. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report of in vivo antihypertensive activity of peptides derived from insect protein.", 
    "483": "Matrix metalloproteinases, a family of proteolytic enzymes are thought to be involved in extracellular matrix accumulation during development of hypertensive target organ disease. The present study was designed to compare hypertensive patients with normotensive individuals with respect to serum levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 and to search for the effect of antihypertensive treatment on the serum enzyme levels.", 
    "484": "Thirty-three patients with stage 1 primary hypertension and sixteen age- and sexmatched control subjects were enrolled into the study. Serum MMP-9 and TIMP-1 levels were assessed in the hypertensive group before and after a 3-month-antihypertensive treatment (candesartan 8 mg/day to 17 patients and lisinopril 10 mg/day to 16 patients).", 
    "485": "Pre-treatment serum MMP-9 levels were higher in the hypertensive group (p=0.309) while serum TIMP-1 levels were lower (p=0.296). Serum MMP-9 levels were decreased (p<0.001) and TIMP-1 levels were increased (p=0.022) after the antihypertensive treatment.", 
    "486": "In hypertensive patients, increased MMP-9 activity could result in increased degradation of elastin relative to collagen and non-elasticity, while decreased TIMP-1 activity could lead to accumulation of poorly cross-linked, immature and unstable fibril degradation products, which result in misdirected deposition of collagen. Our study is important for revealing the role of the MMP enzyme system in the pathogenesis of hypertensive target organ disease.", 
    "487": "One of the efficient modes of treatments of chronic hypertension and cardiovascular disorders has been to restrain the formation of angiotensin-II by inhibiting the action of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) on angiotensin-I. The efforts continue towards achieving superior molecules or drugs with improved affinities, better bioavailability and thus to achieve long duration of action with minimum side effects. Previously, we reported a library of tripeptidomimics of Ornithyl-Proline (Orn-Pro) conjugated with various unnatural amino acids and carboxylic acid derived heterocyclics based on the SAR studies of existing ACE inhibitors. Their synthesis and screening for possible inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) revealed that increase in the backbone chain length by one carbon atom results in a sudden decrease in their activity. Therefore, in the present study heterocycles with different chain length were introduced to interact with the hydrophobic S(2) sub-site of ACE and screened for their in vitro ACE inhibition activity. Further, their binding interaction with C-domain of somatic ACE was also determined. Docking and consequent LUDI scores showed good correlation with binding of these molecules in the active site of ACE. Results suggest that heterocycles with C(3) chain length are more appropriate for the effective binding of the tripeptidomimics within the active site of ACE.", 
    "488": "The documentation for the beneficial effects of antihypertensive treatment in patients with diabetes is overwhelming. Most patients will require three or four antihypertensive drugs to achieve blood pressure (BP) goals. The regime should include an agent that blocks the renin angiotensin aldosterone system. Reduction in albuminuria during antihypertensive treatment is indicative of renal and cardiovascular protection. Thus, if the level of albuminuria remains high, the treatment should be intensified, even in the light of achieved BP goals. Options for intensification are dual blockade, supramaximal doses of ACE-I or ARB, or addition of aldosterone or renin-blocking agents. Long-term data are awaited regarding the optimal strategy for combination therapy. Patients on intensive antihypertensive treatment should be monitored regularly.", 
    "489": "Drug therapy in uncomplicated hypertension can be initiated with either ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, calcium channel blockers or thiazides. In younger patients, the first three classes are preferable. Beta-blockers are first-line drugs for hypertension in patients with cardiac comorbidity. Initial combination therapy is indicated in high-risk patients where blood pressure reduction of > 20/10 mmHg is desired. Resistant hypertension generally calls for an increment in diuretic dosage and/or addition of a potassium-sparing diuretic.", 
    "490": "Hypertension is one of the most important causes of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and its treatment is a major focus of primary and secondary disease prevention strategies. The treatment of hypertension continues to evolve and the need for guidance on the use of newer screening tools, techniques for blood pressure measurement and different classes of drug therapies led to the first European guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension being issued in 2003 by the European Society of Hypertension (ESH) and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC). The first update of these guidelines in 2007 crystallized much of the modern thinking about the evaluation and treatment of patients with hypertension with a sharp focus on detailed assessment of subclinical organ damage and cardiovascular disease risk, as well as differential blood pressure treatment targets and thresholds for those at different levels of risk. This review focuses on the 2007 ESH/ESC Guidelines, highlighting the evolution of treatment strategies in order to meet the challenge of improving blood pressure control in Europe. In particular, development of patient-centred treatment strategies, the benefits of blood pressure lowering, drug-specific influences over clinical outcomes, recommendations for the pharmacological treatment of hypertension and the role of combination therapies are discussed.", 
    "491": "To summarize evidence from clinical trials of heart valve disease and identify areas where further trials are needed.", 
    "492": "Recent randomized studies suggest that statins do not influence progression of aortic stenosis. Other medical therapies with the potential to reduce progression of valve disease or decrease myocardial dysfunction include vasodilators in aortic regurgitation, angiotensin II receptor antagonists or beta-blockers in mitral regurgitation and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in aortic stenosis. However, these treatments have not been evaluated or have been evaluated only in small studies. Meta-analysis of randomized studies of antithrombotic strategies in patients with mechanical valves suggests overall risk is lower with the combination of warfarin with a lower target international normalized ratio and an antiplatelet drug. Novel anticoagulants have the potential to replace warfarin but have not yet been evaluated for this indication. Clinical trials are also needed to reliably evaluate different surgical strategies and novel percutaneous technology.", 
    "493": "Clinical trials in heart valve disease have important limitations, including the small number of trials undertaken and the small size of most studies. Many trials were undertaken more than 10-20 years ago in patients with earlier generation valve prostheses. To improve outcomes for patients with heart valve disease more clinical trials of contemporary approaches are needed.", 
    "494": "Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the main cause of death in developed and developing countries. It is well accepted that several diseases - including hypertension, dyslipidemia and diabetes mellitus - increase CVD. More recently also chronic inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, have been shown to accelerate CVD. This association further supports a responsible role for inflammatory processes in all stages of CVD pathophysiology. Clinically, CVD ranges through different acute and chronic syndromes with ischemic symptoms in distal tissues, including heart, cerebral region or peripheral arteries. Several treatments for reducing CVD are under investigation. In this review we focus on statins, angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and angiotensin-II receptor blockers (ARBs), updating therapeutic evidence from the last clinical trials with particular relevance to diabetic patients.", 
    "495": "Death with function causes half of late kidney transplant failures, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the most common cause of death in these patients. We examined the use of potentially cardioprotective medications in a prospective observational study at seven transplant centers in the United States and Canada. Among 935 patients, 87% received antihypertensive medications at both 1 and 6 months after transplantation. Similar antihypertensive regimens were used for patients with and without diabetes and CVD, but with wide variability among centers. In contrast, while 44% of patients were on angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) at the time of transplantation, the proportion taking these agents dropped to 12% at month 1, then increased to 24% at 6 months. Fewer than 30% with CVD or diabetes received ACEI/ARB therapy 6 months posttransplant. Aspirin use was uncommon (<40% of patients). Even among those with diabetes and/or CVD, fewer than 60% received aspirin and only half received a statin at 1 and 6 months. This study demonstrates marked variability in the use of cardioprotective medications in kidney transplant recipients, a finding that may reflect, among several possible explanations, clinical uncertainty due the lack of randomized trials for these medications in this population.", 
    "496": "Patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) type 2 have a high prevalence of coronary artery disease (CAD), as diabetes is implicated in the formation of atherosclerotic plaque. Hyperglycemia, elevated free fatty acid, increased amount of circulating end-glucosylated serum products and insulin resistance are the main mechanisms involved in the accelerated atherosclerotic process observed in type 2 DM patients. Novel treatments have been proposed to prevent and treat CAD in patients with diabetes, mainly in those with diabetes type 2. Several clinical trials have been designed in order to examine the effectiveness of these agents, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers, glitazones, statins and antioxidants, but the results are still controversial.", 
    "497": "The pharmaceutical relevance of proton-coupled peptide transporters is currently under intense investigation in many laboratories. Studies have shown that these membrane proteins, expressed in intestine, kidney, choroid plexus and other tissues, accept many peptidomimetic drugs and prodrugs as substrates. The focus of this review is on the interaction of beta-lactam antibiotics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, sartans and other drugs with PEPT1 and PEPT2. The article highlights progress made in recent years and the most expedient techniques that have been or are being employed. It also emphasizes the opportunities in rational drug design that are of highest priority and the pitfalls that must be avoided. Finally, an instructional flowchart that might be used to identify a peptide transporter substrate is proposed.",

The most robust effect of GL1001 was observed 48-96 h post DSS treatment and was comparable in magnitude to that of sulfasalazine. Colon pathology and myeloperoxidase activity were also markedly attenuated by high-dose GL1001 treatment, with the most profound effects observed in the distal segment.",

The aims of the ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) substudy of ASCOT were to examine the impact of the two blood pressure (BP)- lowering regimens on ambulatory pressures, test to what extent the between-treatment differences in cardiovascular outcome could be attributed to differences in ABP and assess whether ABP provides predictive information additional to that of clinic blood pressure (CBP) in treated hypertensive patients.", 
    "505": "One thousand, nine hundred and five patients from four ASCOT centres had repeated ABPs performed over a median follow-up period of 5.5 years. As in the whole ASCOT population, CBP values were lower in amlodipine-perindopril-treated patients compared with those treated with atenolol-thiazide [between-regimen difference [95% confidence intervals (CIs)]]: [-1.5 (-2.4 to -0.5)/-1.2 (-1.8 to +0.5) mmHg]. Daytime BP during follow-up was higher in patients treated with amlodipine-perindopril therapy [+1.1 (0.1-2.1)/+1.6 (0.8-2.3) mmHg]; night-time systolic, but not diastolic BP, was lower in patients treated with amlodipine-perindopril therapy [-2.2 (-3.4 to +0.9)/+0.8 (0.0-1.6) mmHg]. The relative risk of a cardiovascular event associated with a 1 SD increment in accumulated mean BP was 1.35 (1.18-1.53) for clinic systolic BP, 1.30 (1.14-1.49) for daytime systolic BP and 1.42 (1.24-1.62) for night-time systolic BP. With adjustment for baseline variables, treatment regimen and clinic systolic BP, the hazard ratios were 1.17 (1.00-1.36) and 1.25 (1.08-1.47) for daytime and night-time systolic BP, respectively. The between-regimen adjusted hazard ratio for cardiovascular events (amlodipine-perindopril therapy versus atenolol-thiazide therapy) was 0.74 (0.55-1.01) and increased to 0.81 (0.60-1.10) after further adjustment for clinic systolic BP. Further, adjustment for night-time systolic BP increased the hazard ratio to 0.85 (0.62-1.16).", 
    "506": "The amlodipine-perindopril and atenolol-thiazide regimens had different effects on daytime and night-time ABP, which may have contributed to the lower rates of events in patients treated with amlodipine-perindopril therapy. Both CBP and ABP were significantly associated with rates of cardiovascular events. ABP nocturnal pressures provided complimentary and incremental utility over CBP in the prediction of cardiovascular risk in treated hypertensive patients. These data support the use of ABP to assess the effect of antihypertensive treatment in clinical practice.",

    "509": "Immunohistochemical staining showed abundant presence of Ang-(1-7) in aortic PVAT. In vessels with PVAT removed but intact endothelium (PVAT - E+), contraction induced by phenylephrine was attenuated by preincubation with Ang-(1-7). PVAT - E+ vessels precontracted with phenylephrine showed a concentration-dependent relaxation response to Ang-(1-7), and this response was abolished by the removal of endothelium. Relaxation response induced by Ang-(1-7) was also prevented by Ang-(1-7) receptor (Mas) antagonist (A779), nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, and nitric oxide scavenger. Ang-(1-7) did not cause a relaxation response in aorta precontracted with KCl, and the relaxation response to Ang-(1-7) was also blocked by calcium-dependent potassium (K(Ca)) channel blockers. Incubation of PVAT + E+ vessels with A779 or angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 inhibitor DX600 or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalaprilat increased the contraction induced by phenylephrine. Transfer of donor solution incubated with PVAT + E+ vessel to recipient PVAT - E+ vessel caused a relaxation response. This relaxation response was abolished when donor vessels were incubated with DX600 or enalaprilat or when recipient vessels were incubated with A779.",

Aldosterone-receptor antagonists (ARAs) are increasingly used in patients with resistant hypertension, often with impressive results. However, definitive evidence for the benefit of ARAs in these patients from randomized, controlled trials is lacking. This review gives an overview of the current data on this topic. Future studies should focus on the identification of factors that are able to predict the response to treatment, as to select patients who will benefit most from treatment with ARAs. On the basis of the current knowledge, we recommend prescription of ARAs to patients with primary aldosteronism, resistant hypertension and patients with hypertension and hypokalemia.",

Of the 27, 13 patients (48%) showed a progression of the IMT whereas in 14/27 patients the IMT values remained stable. In these subgroups, patients with IMT progression showed a higher hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (7.5 +/- 0.8 vs. 7.1 +/- 0.7, p < 0.05) and a slightly higher systolic blood pressure (120 +/- 14.4 vs. 113.9 +/- 12.1, p = 0.08).",

The ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET) studied 23 400 high-risk cardiovascular patients and compared the effectiveness of telmisartan with that of ramipril and showed that the two drugs were 'therapeutically equivalent'. Telmisartan is now the only angiotensin II blocker with clinical trial evidence of cardiovascular protection equivalent to that of ramipril, which is widely regarded as the 'reference' drug for RAS blockade in patients at increased cardiovascular risk. Despite the prior exclusion of patients intolerant of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors drugs, there were fewer discontinuations in the telmisartan group, and so telmisartan had a superior overall efficacy/tolerability ratio.",

The heart failure incidence seen in ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET) and Telmisartan Randomised AssessmeNt Study in ACE iNtolerant subjects with cardiovascular Disease (TRANSCEND) is in line with this observation. In ONTARGET, telmisartan and ramipril were equally effective in heart failure prevention and with the same blood pressure reduction. The low event rate, including the low incidence of heart failure in TRANSCEND with the greater use of diuretics in the placebo arm, may help to explain the absence of significant differences between telmisartan and placebo.", 
    "529": "Activation of the AT1 angiotensin II (Ang II) receptors has various effects including vasoconstriction, hypertrophy, and possibly hyperplasia of vascular smooth muscle cells and cardiomyocytes and increase in extracellular collagen matrix synthesis. These actions lead to the development of cardiovascular hypertrophy and fibrosis, as well as arterial stiffness, which are some key factors in the development of the cardiovascular and renal complications. In clinical studies, it has been shown that renin-angiotensin blockade has direct and specific implications in the evolution of heart failure, coronary disease, stroke, and hypertensive and diabetic renal disease. The beneficial cardiovascular and renal effects of blocking the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system reported in numerous clinical trials may be at least partially related to the actions of these drugs on cardiovascular and renal fibrosis, and arterial stiffness. These effects are now well-established and lead the international medical societies to propose the use of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers as initial treatment (both angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers) in several cardiovascular, metabolic, and renal disorders such as hypertension, heart failure, and proteinuria.", 
    "530": "Stroke is the second most frequent cause of death in the world and is responsible for about 5 million deaths each year. Several trials have raised the possibility that blocking the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) may be beneficial in patients with stroke. The recently reported Prevention Regimen for Effectively Avoiding Second Strokes (PRoFESS) study evaluated the effect of lowering blood pressure with the angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), telmisartan, initiated early after stroke. A total of 80 patients (8.7%) in the telmisartan group and 934 patients (9.2%) in the placebo group had a subsequent stroke, a nonsignificant 5% relative risk reduction in the telmisartan group. Major cardiovascular events occurred in 1367 patients (13.5%) in the telmisartan group and in 1463 patients (14.4%) in the placebo group, a 6% nonsignificant relative risk reduction. The mean follow-up in the PRoFESS study was only 2.5 years, which was too short to assess the impact of treatment on atherosclerotic disease. Stroke prevention aimed at the atherosclerotic process has repercussions on the entire cardiovascular system. The Kaplan-Meier curve of the incidence of major cardiovascular events in PRoFESS has a striking similarity with the Kaplan-Meier curves of Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE), EURopean trial On reduction of cardiac events with Perindopril in stable coronary Artery disease (EUROPA) and Telmisartan Randomised AssessmeNt Study in ACE iNtolerant subjects with cardiovascular Disease (TRANSCEND) trials for a similar endpoint. It is highly probable that with a longer follow-up, the difference between telmisartan-treated and placebo-treated patients would become significant. In 2008, patients with cardiovascular disease are considerably better treated than 10 years ago. By omitting one class of drugs from the cocktail used for prevention in these high-risk patients (statins, beta-blockers, antiplatelet drugs and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or ARBs), part of the benefit obtained by the complete treatment will be lost. PRoFESS seems to be a negative trial at first sight, but if considered together with the available data from other clinical trials, it clearly shows that it would be a mistake to withhold drugs that counteract the effect of angiotensin II in patients with stroke or other atherosclerotic disease.", 
    "531": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are useful drugs for preventing cardiovascular disease and death in patients at risk. However, a significant proportion of patients experience side effects, mainly cough or less frequently angioedema, when treated with ACE inhibitors. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are also useful drugs for treatment of hypertension, diabetic nephropathy and patients with left ventricular dysfunction or cardiac failure who are intolerant to ACE inhibitors. The Telmisartan Randomised AssessmeNt Study in ACE iNtolerant subjects with cardiovascular Disease (TRANSCEND) study examined the effect of a long-acting ARB, telmisartan, on cardiovascular events in a group of patients at high-risk for cardiovascular disease who were intolerant to ACE inhibitors. Five thousand nine hundred twenty-six patients with known intolerance to ACE inhibitors were randomized to telmisartan or placebo added to current treatments. The primary composite endpoint, a sum of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke and hospitalization due to heart failure was nonsignificantly reduced in telmisartan-treated patients with respect to placebo (15.7 vs. 17%; relative risk reduction 8%). The key secondary endpoint (the primary endpoint excluding heart failure hospitalization) was reduced in telmisartan-treated patients by 13% (13 vs. 14.8%; P = 0.046).

    "532": "Angiotensin II plays an important role in the cardiovascular continuum starting with risk factors and progressing to atherosclerosis, target organ damage, and ultimately to heart failure, stroke, or death. Inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) represents a cornerstone for the treatment of hypertension and heart failure. In patients with heart failure, the single RAAS blockade with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality, increase life expectancy, and preserve the renal function. AT1 receptor blockers (ARBs) are equally effective in reducing mortality and morbidity in patients with impaired left ventricular function. The combination of ACE inhibitors with ARBs leads to an additive blood pressure lowering effect, better reduction in proteinuria, and to additive benefits in heart failure and left ventricular hypertrophy. But combination therapy is also associated with more side effects. Further investigations evaluating the effect of dual RAAS blockade on fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events are needed.", 
    "533": "The majority of patients with SSc are believed to have subclinical primary cardiac involvement. Overt cardiac manifestations of SSc are associated with poor prognosis and can be difficult to manage. Primary myocardial disease, i.e. without systemic or pulmonary hypertension and without significant pulmonary or renal disease, is postulated to be due to microvascular ischaemia. Undetected early cardiac manifestations can progress silently to myocardial fibrosis. Symptoms may manifest without warning and can rapidly lead to arrhythmia and left and right heart dysfunction and failure. Of the currently practical screening methods, annual echocardiography and/or evaluation of N-terminal portion of pro-B-type natriuretic peptide concentrations should therefore be employed in SSc patients, in order to anticipate the development of cardiac symptoms. Although there is limited evidence in respect of specific therapeutic options, treatment of early abnormalities with calcium channel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may improve myocardial perfusion and function, while standard management of overt cardiac disease is equally appropriate in the SSc population. However, it remains to be seen if early intervention can limit the progression of these life-threatening complications.", 
    "534": "Scleroderma renal crisis (SRC) occurs in 5-10% of SSc patients, who may present with an abrupt onset of hypertension, acute renal failure, headaches, fevers, malaise, hypertensive retinopathy, encephalopathy and pulmonary oedema. Patients at greatest risk of developing SRC are those with diffuse cutaneous or rapidly progressive forms of SSc, and treatment with a recently commenced high dose of corticosteroid. Laboratory tests may demonstrate hypercreatinaemia, microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia (MAHA), thrombocytopaenia and hyperreninaemia. Renal crisis is also linked to a positive ANA speckled pattern, antibodies to RNA polymerase I and II, and an absence of anti-centromere antibodies. Early, aggressive treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors has improved prognosis in SRC, although 40% of the patients may require dialysis, and mortality at 5 yrs is 30-40%. Median time to recovery is 1 yr, and typically occurs within 3 yrs. Prognosis is worse for males, but may not be related to corticosteroid use, presence of MAHA or severity of renal pathology. Modification of endothelin over-activity, which is implicated in the pathogenesis of SRC, may offer a future therapeutic approach.",

One of the effects of the activated RAS is target-organ damage, in part due to their effects on causing hypertension. Blocking angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) with inhibitors has been shown to attenuate the pathological effects of the RAS. Clinical trials have shown that ACE inhibition improves outcomes in the prevention of acute myocardial infarction, lowering the morbidity and mortality in congestive heart failure, and attenuates renal dysfunction. There is recent evidence to show that angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have similar efficacy to ACE inhibitors in reducing cardiovascular outcomes. The wealth of information obtained regarding the beneficial effects of RAS inhibition on clinical outcome has been focused on monotherapy with either ARB or ACE inhibition. Evidence from some trials suggests that better overall inhibition of RAS by dual therapy may improve clinical outcomes. Combination therapy has been shown to be beneficial in patients with congestive heart failure or renal disease. The Valsartan in Acute Myocardial Infarction Trial (VALIANT) trial showed equal benefit of either ARB or ACE inhibition with reduction in primary end points in postmyocardial infarction patients, but there was no further benefit from dual therapy in reducing outcomes. In the recent ONTARGET study, there was further evidence that ARBs are equal to ACE inhibitors in reducing cardiovascular events. In Ongoing Telmisartan, Ramipril, or Both in Patients at High Risk for Vascular Events (ONTARGET), combined RAS blockade did not have any added benefit but resulted in increased risk of adverse outcomes. In the Candesartan in Heart Failure (CHARM) and the Valsartan Heart Failure Trial (Val-HeFT) trials of patients with severe heart failure, the addition of an ARB to an ACE inhibitor reduced cardiac mortality and lowered hospital admissions. Whether or not dual therapy is beneficial in patients with diabetic renal failure should be clarified by future studies.

The ADVANCE trial clearly demonstrated that a simple and easily applicable pharmacological strategy based on perindopril/indapamide fixed combination could substantially reduce total and cardiovascular mortality (-14% and -18%, respectively). The observed benefits were largely caused by a substantial decrease in systolic blood pressure (SBP), confirming the need to have ambitious therapeutic goals in such high-risk patients. This point is of importance because most of the patients included in the trial were being treated for hypertension, and baseline brachial SBP and diastolic blood pressure at inclusion were very close to normal. Previous mechanistic studies have highlighted the positive effect of perindopril/indapamide fixed combination on large artery function as well as on microvascular structure. For example, in the REASON trial, in patients treated with perindopril/indapamide, the decrease in central aortic SBP, which closely correlated with the decrease in left ventricular hypertrophy, reflected a significant improvement in large artery function and a changing pattern in both peripheral reflection coefficients and structural arteriolar network. These data are supported by those from other studies, which show increases in coronary blood flow reserve with perindopril/indapamide treatment.

As the ADVANCE trial included both hypertensive and normotensive patients, its results suggest that systematically treating all patients with diabetes with perindopril/indapamide, independently of their baseline blood pressure, may have significant long-term value that can be explained partly by the reversal of end-organ damage to the kidney and the heart. Considering that patients with both hypertension and diabetes are characterized by generalized macro- and microvascular disease, the results of the ADVANCE trial, taken together with results of other perindopril/indapamide hypertension studies, support a broad use of perindopril/indapamide treatment for the long-term improvement of prognosis in hypertensive patients as well as in patients with diabetes.",

Sixty stable outpatients with essential hypertension who had received amlodipine and ACE-I or ARB for more than 1 year were randomized into two groups (amlodipine group (n=30): continuous amlodipine treatment at a stable dose; efonidipine group (n=30): amlodipine (5 mg day(-1)) was changed to efonidipine at a dose of 40 mg day(-1)). There was no difference in their baseline characteristics including the LVMI and plasma levels of ALD. In the amlodipine group, there were no significant changes in blood pressure, LVMI or plasma levels of ALD for 18 months. In the efonidipine group, blood pressure did not change after replacement of amlodipine with efonidipine, although there was a significant decrease in the plasma levels of ALD after 6 months. The decrease in ALD was sustained for 18 months and LVMI was significantly decreased after 18 months (121+/-25 vs. 114+/-21 g m(-2), P<0.05). There was a significant correlation between the changes in LVMI and % changes of ALD in the efonidipine group. These findings indicate that the effect of efonidipine on the suppression of plasma ALD was sustained for at least 18 months and that long-term efonidipine therapy decreases LVMI in patients with essential hypertension.",

    "591": "Increasing evidence suggests that the renin-angiotensin-system contributes to the etiology of obesity. To evaluate the role of the renin-angiotensin-system in energy and glucose homeostasis, we examined body weight and composition, food intake, and glucose tolerance in rats given the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril ( approximately 40 mg/kg . d). Rats given captopril weighed less than controls when fed a high-fat diet (369.3 +/- 8.0 vs. 441.7 +/- 8.5 g after 35 d; P < 0.001) or low-fat chow (320.1 +/- 4.9 vs. 339.8 +/- 5.1 g after 21 d; P < 0.0001). This difference was attributable to reductions in adipose mass gained on high-fat (23.8 +/- 2.0 vs. 65.12 +/- 8.4 g after 35 d; P < 0.0001) and low-fat diets (12.2 +/- 0.7 vs. 17.3 +/- 1.3 g after 21 d; P < 0.001). Rats given captopril ate significantly less [3110.3 +/- 57.8 vs. 3592.4 +/- 88.8 kcal (cumulative 35 d high fat diet intake); P < 0.001] despite increased in neuropeptide-Y mRNA expression in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and had improved glucose tolerance compared with free-fed controls. Comparisons with pair-fed controls indicated that decreases in diet-induced weight gain and adiposity and improved glucose tolerance were due, primarily, to decreased food intake. To determine whether captopril caused animals to defend a lower body weight, animals in both groups were fasted for 24 h and subsequently restricted to 20% of their intake for 2 d. When free food was returned, captopril and control rats returned to their respective body weights and elicited comparable hyperphagic responses. These results suggest that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition protects against the development of diet-induced obesity and glucose intolerance.",

Antiarrhythmic drug therapy to maintain sinus rhythm is limited by inadequate efficacy and potentially serious side effects. New areas of research include targeting the AF substrate and examining whether drugs can produce atrial structural and/or electrophysiological remodelling, and whether this results in a reduction in AF burden. There are two approaches to the treatment of AF. The first approach is cardioversion and treatment with antiarrhythmic drugs to maintain sinus rhythm. The other approach is the use of rate-controlling drugs allowing AF to persist. In both approaches, the use of anticoagulant drugs is recommended. There is an increasing interest in novel therapeutic approaches that target AF-substrate development. Recent trials suggest that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor II blockers (ARBs) may be useful, particularly in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy, hypertension, chronic heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction. While experimental studies have shown that the pathogenic structural and electrical remodelling of the atria are prevented by inhibition of angiotensin II, the clinical potential and mechanisms of this approach are still under active investigation. The present article will discuss information pertaining to the mechanism of action and clinical use of ACEIs and ARBs in AF. It will also review the current data on the use of ACEIs and ARBs in a high-risk group of AF patients (heart failure, hypertensive with left ventricular hypertrophy, and myocardial infarction), together with the potential benefit of this class type of pharmacological therapy in direct current cardioversion and after radiofrequency catheter ablation.", 
    "622": "Cardiovascular (CV) and renal complications associated with diabetes can be attenuated with antihypertensives that work on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS),particularly angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and possibly direct renin inhibitors (DRIs). Cardioprotective and renoprotective benefits are independent of the blood pressure-lowering effect of the RAAS inhibitor. Given more complete RAAS blockade, evidence has suggested that the use of ACE inhibitor/ARB combination therapy may provide greater target organ protection. However, recent data have challenged this assumption. Although advances have been made in reducing diabetic nephropathy progression through use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs, improvement in organ protection is needed because diabetes remains the leading cause of end-stage renal disease. Despite the use of these agents in patients with CV disease and diabetes, CV adverse events remain high, suggesting the need for improved outcomes. Newer agents such as DRIs may have the potential to offer similar target organ protection. The first DRI, aliskiren, administered alone or in combination with other RAAS inhibitors, has been shown to confer renoprotective and cardioprotective benefits in human and animal studies that have measured surrogate endpoints. An ongoing outcomes study (Aliskiren Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Using Cardio-Renal Endpoints [ALTITUDE]), which is assessing renal and CV morbidity and mortality, will further define whether aliskiren provides additional benefits beyond RAAS inhibition and lowering of blood pressure.",

Blood pressure is regulated mainly by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). In the present study, we investigated the effect of dietary ALA on ACE to clarify the mechanism of the antihypertensive effect in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Six-week-old SHR were fed a diet containing either 10% ALA-rich flaxseed oil or high oleic safflower oil as a control for four weeks. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured by the tail cuff method once weekly. At the end of the feeding period, ACE activity was determined in the heart, aorta, lung and kidney. ACE mRNA in these organs was also measured by real-time PCR analysis. SBP in the ALA group was significantly lower than in the control group at 2, 3, and 4 weeks. The ACE activity and mRNA expression levels in the ALA group were significantly lower than in the control only in the aorta. In conclusion, the present findings suggest that the blood pressure-lowering mechanism of dietary ALA may be involved in the reduction of ACE activity and mRNA expression levels in the aorta of SHR.",

Antarctic krill peptide powder (AKPP) prepared from the tail meat by enzymatic hydrolysis significantly decreased the systolic blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats by a single oral administration (1, 10, or 100 mg). Presumably, the effect of AKPP was through inhibition of the conversion of angiotensin, which mediates blood pressure elevation, from its inactive propeptide to the mature angiotensin. Two potent angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides were isolated from AKPP by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and identified as Val-Trp (IC(50)= 2.75 microg/mL; 12.9 microM) and Leu-Lys-Tyr (IC(50)= 4.26 microg/mL; 10.1 microM). Val-Trp and Leu-Lys-Tyr comprised 0.025%+/- 0.0023% (w/w) and 0.018%+/- 0.0023% (w/w) of AKPP, respectively, as measured by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). The contributions of Val-Trp and Leu-Lys-Tyr to the ACE inhibitor activity of AKPP were 17.7%+/- 1.60% and 8.04%+/- 1.03%, respectively, suggesting that these 2 peptides constitute a substantial portion of the overall ACE inhibitor potential of AKPP.",

This study aimed to investigate the enhanced attenuation of myocardial fibrosis in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) possibly induced by joint treatment with benazepril and candesartan and the possible involvement of transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1)-Smad signaling pathway. SHRs were treated with benazepril at 10 mg.kg.d, candesartan at 4 mg.kg.d, and a combination of 2 drugs at half dose, respectively, for 12 weeks. Echocardiography and histology indicated that joint treatment with 2 drugs more significantly inhibited myocardial fibrosis in SHRs than either monotherapy, as evidenced by the changes in cardiac structural parameters, ultrasonic integrated backscatters, collagen volume fraction, and perivascular collagen area. The collagen analyses further revealed that significant decreases in total collagen concentration, the ratio of collagen type I to type III, and collagen cross-linking were found after the enhanced attenuation of myocardial fibrosis. Western blot analysis showed that the protein expression of TGF-beta1 and Smad3 was significantly decreased after joint treatment with 2 drugs. We conclude that synergistic attenuation of myocardial fibrosis in SHRs is produced by combined use of benazepril and candesartan possibly through the modulation of TGF-beta/Smad signaling proteins.",

Although various drug therapies are used to lower peripheral blood pressure (BP) in patients with isolated systolic hypertension, the effects of the 4 major classes of antihypertensive agents on central BP, pulse pressure (PP) amplification, and arterial stiffness in this condition are not clear. Fifty-nine patients over the age of 60 years with untreated isolated systolic hypertension (systolic BP > or =140 mm Hg and diastolic BP <or =90 mm Hg) were randomly assigned to receive 1 of the following 4 antihypertensive agents: perindopril, atenolol, lercanidipine, or bendrofluazide. BP was measured using a mercury sphygmomanometer, and augmentation index and carotid-femoral (aortic) pulse wave velocity were measured at baseline, after 2 weeks of placebo therapy, and at the end of 10 weeks of active therapy. Peripheral systolic BP and peripheral PP were reduced similarly after treatment with all 4 classes of drug. However, central PP was only reduced significantly by perindopril, lercanidipine, and bendrofluazide, whereas atenolol had no effect. Lercanidipine reduced the augmentation index, whereas atenolol increased it. Aortic pulse wave velocity was not changed by any of the drugs. In summary, despite similar reductions in peripheral systolic and PPs with the 4 classes of drug, changes in central pressure and augmentation index varied. Because central PP and increased wave reflections are considered important risk factors in patients with isolated systolic hypertension, the choice of therapy may be influenced by these findings in the future.",

As the population lives longer with chronic diseases, researchers estimate that the incidence of PAD will increase, likely increasing myocardial infarction, stroke and death. This paper reviews the epidemiology, pathophysiology, risk factors, treatment and management of PAD. With improved understanding of the disease process, risk factors and treatment, clinicians will be able to detect PAD earlier, provide diagnosis, treat and manage this disease. PAD is associated with reduced quality of life, and persons with PAD are also at risk of developing coronary artery disease and cerebrovascular disease. Better clinical evaluation and routine screening are important in identifying and treating patients at risk for PAD. All patients with PAD should receive risk-factor modification, such as treatment and education, about smoking cessation, blood pressure control and lowering of cholesterol. Appropriate pharmacological management includes antiplatelet therapy of aspirin, use of clopidogrel for those individuals who are sensitive to aspirin. Patients who have had bypass surgery or stent placement require dual antiplatelet therapy of aspirin and clopidogrel. The American Heart Association (AHA) states that treatment with beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors is appropriate pharmacotherapy to treat PAD.

Numerous pharmacologic interventions, such as ACE inhibition and beta-blockade have demonstrated significant physiologic and prognostic improvement in this population. Furthermore, a number of investigations demonstrating a positive change in the CPX response resulting from a pharmacologic intervention now exist. Because CPX variables reflect pathophysiologic processes differently, their response to a given pharmacologic is unique. For example, beta-blockade has been shown to significantly improve ventilatory efficiency, one of the most powerful prognostic markers obtained from CPX, while not altering aerobic capacity or heart rate recovery. Conversely, ACE and phosphodiesterase-5 inhibition appears to improve ventilatory efficiency and aerobic capacity. Given the prognostic value of CPX, gauging its improvement from pharmacotherapy may be advantageous in facilitating optimal titration of medications. A comprehensive review describing the physiologic and prognostic importance of CPX in the context of pharmacotherapy does not exist. This mini review will: 1. Identify key CPX variables obtained from CPX including aerobic capacity, ventilatory efficiency and heart rate recovery, 2. Describe the physiologic and prognostic significance of CPX in the heart failure population, and, 3. Summarize the present body of evidence addressing the change in CPX in response to different pharmacologic interventions including beta-blockade, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis inhibition and sildenafil.",

It has been suggested that hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance, glycation of proteins, oxidative stress, inflammation, and many other factors may be related to atherogenesis in diabetes. The metabolic abnormalities associated with diabetes lead to activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), with a subsequent increase of angiotensin II and aldosterone levels, which might alter the insulin signaling pathway and promote the formation of reactive oxygen species that induce endothelial dysfunction as well as cardiovascular disease and renal disease. Synthesis of angiotensin II is not only catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme, but also by chymase. Recently, angiotensin II produced by chymase was reported to be involved in vascular proliferation and atherosclerosis. Chymase also activates matrix metalloproteinase-9, leading to extracellular matrix degradation, and promotes cardiovascular remodeling. Many studies have shown that angiotensin-II blockade significantly reduces the levels of proinflammatory mediators and suppresses oxidative stress. In clinical trials, RAAS blockade has been found to delay or prevent the onset of type 2 diabetes, and it also prevents cardiovascular and renal events in diabetic patients. Thus, RAAS inhibition represents first-line treatment for hypertensive and diabetic target organ damage, as well as preventing the progression of cardiovascular disease and kidney disease. This review presents the available information about the role of the RAAS in the cardiovascular and renal complications of diabetes.", 
    "641": "Chronic kidney disease is becoming a public health challenge due to the high risk of progression to end-stage kidney disease, the increased cardiovascular burden and management costs, especially among disadvantaged communities. Although the high prevalence of hypertension and diabetes in these populations are recognized risk factors and a leading cause of chronic kidney disease, ethnic populations show a greater likelihood of developing end-stage kidney disease regardless of these cardiovascular risk factors. The association between low socioeconomic status and the prevalence/progression of chronic kidney disease observed in population-based studies suggests that socioeconomic disadvantage could be a plausible reason for the increased burden of renal disease among minorities. Interventions for management and prevention of chronic kidney disease include angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers. Few studies of these agents have been conducted in indigenous populations, but there is evidence that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are effective in reducing premature deaths and progression of chronic kidney disease, as well as being highly cost-effective, especially in terms of renal replacement therapies avoided. It is plausible that these disadvantaged groups may benefit more than others from a renal and cardiovascular prevention program, but considerable under-recognition and under-treatment of these conditions still exist.",

We classified our patients according to Liston's classification as ignition apraxia, which enabled us to approach the patients in a practical way. This classification helps to understand the underlying pathologies and combines clinical characteristics and pathophysiology.

Here we investigated RAS signaling in retinas explanted from adult rats exposed for 48 h to high glucose (HG), with or without the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme inhibitor enalaprilat, which blocks RAS. HG was observed to i) initiate a phosphotyrosine-dependent signaling cascade; ii) up-regulate Angiotensin(1) Receptor (AT(1)R); iii) activate src tyrosine kinase and increase phosphorylation of Pyk2, PLCgamma1 and ERK1/2; and iv) activate Akt and the transcription factor CREB. In the presence of enalaprilat, tyrosine phosphorylation signal and AT(1)R upregulation decreased and activation of PLCgamma1 and CREB reverted, showing their relation to RAS signaling. In line with Akt activation, no apoptosis or synapse degeneration was found. M\u00fcller glia was activated, but in a RAS-independent manner.

Moreover, a different awareness of the patient's compliance has been highlighted in relation to the setting (hospital, family doctor, etc.). The analysis and assessment of the prescription and efficacy of therapy for secondary prevention of coronary artery disease represent one of the most important challenges for the healthcare system, because reliable data are necessary to verify usefulness and results of therapy, prescribed at discharge after an acute coronary syndrome and/or coronary artery bypass graft, but above all the actual application of treatments should be pursued in every clinical setting. The Cardiology School of the Trieste University has constituted a working group of cardiology students that during the year 2009 will enroll and follow for 1 year all patients with coronary artery disease discharged from the Cardiovascular Department and Emergency Unit of the University Hospital of Trieste to assess: (1) if evidence-based medicine for secondary prevention of coronary artery disease is applied in the Trieste area; (2) adherence to prescribed treatment; (3) factors that are associated with non-adherence and consequences of non-adherence.",

Diabetes causes a two- to fourfold increase in the risk of cardiovascular disease, and represents the first cause of dialysis treatment both in the UK and the US. Concomitant hypertension doubles total mortality and stroke risk, triples the risk of coronary heart disease and significantly hastens the progression of microvascular complications, including diabetic nephropathy. Therefore, blood pressure reduction is of particular importance in preventing cardiovascular and renal outcomes. Successful antihypertensive treatment will often require a combination therapy, either with separate drugs or with fixed-dose combinations. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor plus diuretic combination therapy improves blood pressure control, counterbalances renin-angiotensin system activation due to diuretic therapy and reduces the risk of electrolyte alterations, obtaining at the same time synergistic antiproteinuric effects. ACE inhibitor plus calcium channel blocker provides a significant additive effect on blood pressure reduction, may have favorable metabolic effects and synergistically reduce proteinuria and the rate of decline in glomerular filtration rate, as evidenced by the GUARD trial. Finally, the recently published ACCOMPLISH trial showed that an ACE inhibitor/calcium channel blocker combination may be particularly useful in reducing cardiovascular outcomes in high-risk patients.

Hitherto, CHF therapy was aimed at improving LV contractability, whereas more recently the aim has shifted to resting the heart. Most patients with HF should be routinely managed with a combination of 3 types of drugs: a diuretic; an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and/or an angiotensin II receptor blocker; and a beta-blocker. The administration of beta-blockers is of particular importance. For HF unresponsive to medical therapy, non-pharmacological therapies are considered. When a HF patient fails to respond to all available therapies, heart transplantation becomes necessary. Of the 1,000 HF patients admitted to our hospital, two cases received heart transplants. 11 cases were indicated for heart transplantation but died before registration.

The aim of this study was to determine whether Cx45 is able to substitute the function of Cx40 with regard to the localization of renin-producing cells. For this purpose, we have studied the distribution of renin-expressing cells under both normal conditions and during a stimulatory challenge of the renin system by inducing salt deprivation in mice, achieved by replacing the coding sequence of the Cx40 gene with that of Cx45 (Cx40ki45). In both wild-type (WT) mice and Cx40ki45 mice under normal conditions, renin-expressing cells were located at the juxtaglomerular position, whereas in Cx40-deficient mice they were located in the periglomerular interstitium. Upon challenge of the renin system, renin mRNA and the number of renin-expressing cells increased in WT mice in the media layer of afferent arterioles, while neither parameter changed significantly in Cx40-deficient mice. In Cx40ki45 mice, challenge of the renin system markedly increased both renin mRNA and the number of renin-expressing cells. However, the newly recruited renin-expressing cells were localized mainly outside the afferent vessels in the periglomerular interstitium. We found no evidence of cell divisions in renin-expressing cells in any of the genotypes investigated in this study, suggesting that the ectopically localized, renin-expressing cells in Cx40ki45 mice were already preexisting but were not renin-expressing under normal conditions. In summary, we infer from our findings that the function of Cx40 for the localization of potential renin-producing cells cannot be substituted by that of Cx45, although the regulability of renin gene expression can.",

    "687": "Doxorubicin (Dox) is a potent anticancer agent; its clinical use is limited for its marked cardiotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. The present study investigated the possible protective effect of telmisartan, an angiotensin AT(1)-receptor blocker versus captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, on Dox-induced cardiotoxicity and nephrotoxicity in rats. Rats were allocated into four groups. Control group, Dox group, Dox+telmisartan group, and Dox+captopril group. Cardiotoxicity and nephrotoxicity were assessed biochemically and histopathologically. Frozen heart and kidney specimens were used for estimation of lipid peroxides product (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and nitric oxide (NO). Expression of induced nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) was detected by immunohistochemistry. Coadministration of either telmisartan or captopril with Dox equally decreased the biochemical markers of both cardiotoxicity (LDH and CK-MP) and nephrotoxicity (urea and creatinine). Both telmisartan and captopril attenuated the effects of Dox on oxidative stress parameters and NO. Histopathologically, coadministration of either drug with Dox was able to attenuate Dox-induced myocardial fibrosis and renal tubular damage. Immunohistochemistry, expression of iNOS was increased in both cardiac and renal tissues. Both telmisartan and captopril significantly and equally attenuated the effect of Dox on all measured parameters. These results suggested that telmisartan has protective effects equal to that of captopril against Dox-induced cardiotoxicity and nephrotoxicity; implying that angiotensin II pathway plays a role in Dox-induced cardiac and renal damage. The protective effect of either drug relies, at least in part, on their antioxidant effects and decreased the expression of iNOS.",

In this study, captopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor that prevents angiotensin II formation, was used to study the development of diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance in obesity prone C57BL/6J mice. The mice were fed a high fat diet (w/w 21% fat) and allowed access to either water or water with captopril added (0.2 mg/ml). Body weight was recorded weekly and water and food intake daily. Glucose tolerance was determined after 11-12 weeks. On completion of the study (after 16 weeks of treatment), the mice were killed and kidney, liver, epididymal fat and extensor digitorum longus muscle (EDL) were weighed. Blood samples were collected and plasma analysed for metabolites and hormones. Captopril treatment decreased body weight in the first 2 weeks of treatment. Food intake of captopril-treated mice was similar to control mice prior to weight loss and was decreased after weight loss. Glucose tolerance was improved in captopril-treated mice. Captopril-treated mice had less epididymal fat than control mice. Relative to body weight, captopril-treated mice had increased EDL weight. Relative to control mice, mice administered captopril had a higher plasma concentration of adiponectin and lower concentrations of leptin and non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA). The results indicate that captopril both induced weight loss and improved insulin sensitivity. Thus, captopril may eventually be used for the treatment of obesity and Type 2 diabetes.",

Patients with an ejection fraction <40% and coronary artery disease who had a cardiac catheterization from April 1994 through December 2005 were identified. Long-term patterns of beta-blocker and ACEI/ARB use were categorized as persistent, new, previous, or no use based on information from routine follow-up surveys. Characteristics among medication-use groups were explored, and survival associated with persistent use was determined. Of 3,187 patients identified for the beta-blocker analysis, 1,339 (42.0%) had persistent use. Conditional on surviving for > or = 2 follow-up surveys, the adjusted risk of death was statistically significantly lower with persistent use versus no use (hazard ratio [HR] 0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.65 to 0.82) and new use versus no use (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.97).

High-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels, similar in the 2 groups at baseline, were significantly more decreased by telmisartan than by ramipril at follow up (p = 0.013 for time-by-drug interaction). The main effect for time was also significant (p <0.001). CD34+/KDR+ and CD34+/CD133+ cells were similar at baseline and did not change over time (p = 0.2 and p = 0.1, respectively). In contrast, for CD34+/KDR+/CD45- and CD34+/CD133+/CD45- cells, a significant increase with time was seen (p = 0.02 and p = 0.002, respectively) and no differential effect of either drug was seen. In conclusion, telmisartan shows a more potent anti-inflammatory effect than ramipril after an ACS. The 2 drugs do not show a differential effect on endothelial progenitor cell mobilization.",

Two weeks treatment with various antihypertensive drugs did not lead to significant changes of ADMA levels. However antihypertensive drugs from various classes produced different effects on levels of MNO.

    "733": "Heart failure (HF) is more prevalent and evolves more rapidly in patients with renal failure (RF). Renal failure not only produces myocardial damage, but also induces the development of clinical heart failure thus making the treatment of these patients more difficult. The incidence of HF in patients with RF is around 15%. Renal function in patients with RF is lower than in the general population. This is true for patients with preserved and depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). HF mortality increases 30% for every 1-mg/dL increase in creatinine and renal function should always be considered when assessing the cardiovascular risk and therapeutic alternatives of cardiovascular patients. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, Angiotensin receptor blockers and aldosterone blockers may cause acute renal failure and serum creatinine and potassium should be closely monitored. Chronic RF is a human model of accelerated atherosclerosis. It induces a rapid progression of coronary atherosclerosis and make atherosclerotic plaques more vulnerable to acute coronary syndromes (ACS) because of coagulation changes inherent to RF. Ischemia is also more frequent due to the imbalance between oxygen requirements and supplies. Chronic RF is associated with a worse outcome in patients with ACS and increases the risk of bleeding, and is associated with a higher mortality in patients under surgical or percutaneous coronary revascularization. Of the patients treated with an interventional coronary procedure (ICP), 3,3% suffer acute RF. Saline administration at a dose of 1 ml/kg/h for 12 hours before and 12 hours after ICP prevents the development of acute RF. Although the role of N-acetylcysteine is under discussion, taking into account the favourable risk profile of this drug, it seems reasonable to administer N-acetylcysteine in addition to saline administration. In ACS patients with severe RF, the risk of severe bleeding depends upon the anticoagulation regimen, increasing particularly when unfractionated heparin is used in combination with GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors.",

First-line agents for renoprotection are angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers at the highest tolerated dose. The combination of these types of drugs, the so-called dual blockade, further reduces an elevated urinary albumin or protein excretion but, at least in patients at high cardiovascular risk, does not delay progression of renal failure. An intensified multifactorial intervention is necessary for renal patients because 35 to 50% of cases with grade 3 or 4 CKD are prone to premature complications such as end-stage renal disease and/or cardiovascular events. New strategies to block the renin-angiotensin system could be of help in improving of outcomes in CKD patients.", 
    "735": "Patients with chronic kidney disease are at high risk of cardiovascular disease and should receive intensive risk-reduction therapy. Early detection of albuminuria and chronic kidney disease can identify individuals at increased risk of adverse clinical events and therefore may have a better opportunity to improve their outcomes. The determination of serum creatinine should not be the only parameter used to as renal function. The evaluation of the renal involvement in patients with cardiovascular disease should be done using the determination of albumin in a urine spot test and estimating glomerular filtration from predictive equations derived from creatinine. The MDRD equation is of choice but alternatively the Cockcroft-Gault formula can also be used.", 
    "736": "Cardiac fibroblasts are the most prevalent cell type in the heart and play a key role in regulating normal myocardial function and in the adverse myocardial remodeling that occurs with hypertension, myocardial infarction and heart failure. Many of the functional effects of cardiac fibroblasts are mediated through differentiation to a myofibroblast phenotype that expresses contractile proteins and exhibits increased migratory, proliferative and secretory properties. Cardiac myofibroblasts respond to proinflammatory cytokines (e.g. TNFalpha, IL-1, IL-6, TGF-beta), vasoactive peptides (e.g. angiotensin II, endothelin-1, natriuretic peptides) and hormones (e.g. noradrenaline), the levels of which are increased in the remodeling heart. Their function is also modulated by mechanical stretch and changes in oxygen availability (e.g. ischaemia-reperfusion). Myofibroblast responses to such stimuli include changes in cell proliferation, cell migration, extracellular matrix metabolism and secretion of various bioactive molecules including cytokines, vasoactive peptides and growth factors. Several classes of commonly prescribed therapeutic agents for cardiovascular disease also exert pleiotropic effects on cardiac fibroblasts that may explain some of their beneficial outcomes on the remodeling heart. These include drugs for reducing hypertension (ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-blockers), cholesterol levels (statins, fibrates) and insulin resistance (thiazolidinediones). In this review, we provide insight into the properties of cardiac fibroblasts that underscores their importance in the remodeling heart, including their origin, electrophysiological properties, role in matrix metabolism, functional responses to environmental stimuli and ability to secrete bioactive molecules. We also review the evidence suggesting that certain cardiovascular drugs can reduce myocardial remodeling specifically via modulatory effects on cardiac fibroblasts.",

In this double-blind study, 654 hypertensive patients (24-h mean ambulatory diastolic BP (MADBP) >or=85 mm Hg) were randomized 1:1:1 to once-daily aliskiren 150 mg, irbesartan 150 mg or ramipril 5 mg. Doses were doubled after 2 weeks. At day 42, patients were again randomized equally within each group to receive 1 day of placebo ('missed dose') on either day 42 or day 49.

The 24-h mean ambulatory systolic BP (MASBP)/MADBP reductions from baseline after a missed dose of aliskiren 300 mg (9.3/7.0 mm Hg) were similar to irbesartan 300 mg (9.5/7.3 mm Hg) and significantly larger than ramipril 10 mg (7.1/5.0 mm Hg, P<or=0.008). Loss of BP-lowering effect with aliskiren in the 24 h after a missed dose (1.0/0.7 mm Hg for 24-48-h vs 0-24-h MASBP/MADBP) was significantly lower than with irbesartan (3.6/2.2 mm Hg, P<0.01) or ramipril (4.0/2.6, P<0.0001). This equates to maintenance of 91/91% of the MASBP/MADBP-lowering effect with aliskiren, greater than irbesartan (73/77%) or ramipril (64/65%). The incidence of adverse events was similar across treatments (32.9-36.0%), although ramipril treatment was associated with an increased incidence of cough (ramipril, 6.1%; aliskiren, 0.5%; irbesartan, 1.8%). Aliskiren 300 mg provided a sustained BP-lowering effect beyond the 24-h dosing interval, with a significantly smaller loss of BP-lowering effect in the 24-48 h period after dose than irbesartan 300 mg or ramipril 10 mg.",

In the present study, we sought to determine whether low-dose spironolactone alleviates maladaptive vein graft arterialization and alters intimal reaction to coronary artery stenting. Yorkshire pigs were randomized to treatment with oral spironolactone 25 mg daily or placebo. All animals underwent right carotid artery interposition grafting using a segment of external jugular vein and, 5 days later, underwent angiography of carotid and coronary arteries. At that time, a bare metal stent was placed in the left anterior descending artery and balloon angioplasty was performed on the circumflex coronary artery. Repeat carotid and coronary angiograms were performed before euthanasia and graft excision at 30 days. Angiography revealed that venous grafts of spironolactone-treated animals had lumen diameters twice the size of controls at 5 days, a finding that persisted at 30 days. However, neointima and total vessel wall areas also were 2- to 3-fold greater in spironolactone-treated animals, and there were no differences in vessel wall layer thicknesses or collagen and elastin densities. In the coronary circulation, there were no differences between treatment groups in any vessel wall parameters in either stented or unstented vessels. Taken together, these observations suggest that low-dose spironolactone may exert a novel protective effect on remodeling in venous arterial grafts that does not depend on the reduction of hyperplastic changes but may involve dilatation of the vessel wall.",

The extra effect was limited to a few years after myocardial infarction, with a risk reduction of 31% compared with 13% in people with CHD with no recent infarct (P=0.04). In the other blood pressure difference trials (excluding CHD events in trials of beta blockers in people with CHD), there was a 22% reduction in CHD events (17% to 27%) and a 41% (33% to 48%) reduction in stroke for a blood pressure reduction of 10 mm Hg systolic or 5 mm Hg diastolic, similar to the reductions of 25% (CHD) and 36% (stroke) expected for the same difference in blood pressure from the cohort study meta-analysis, indicating that the benefit is explained by blood pressure reduction itself. The five main classes of blood pressure lowering drugs (thiazides, beta blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and calcium channel blockers) were similarly effective (within a few percentage points) in preventing CHD events and strokes, with the exception that calcium channel blockers had a greater preventive effect on stroke (relative risk 0.92, 95% confidence interval 0.85 to 0.98). The percentage reductions in CHD events and stroke were similar in people with and without cardiovascular disease and regardless of blood pressure before treatment (down to 110 mm Hg systolic and 70 mm Hg diastolic). Combining our results with those from two other studies (the meta-analyses of blood pressure cohort studies and of trials determining the blood pressure lowering effects of drugs according to dose) showed that in people aged 60-69 with a diastolic blood pressure before treatment of 90 mm Hg, three drugs at half standard dose in combination reduced the risk of CHD by an estimated 46% and of stroke by 62%; one drug at standard dose had about half this effect. The present meta-analysis also showed that drugs other than calcium channel blockers (with the exception of non-cardioselective beta blockers) reduced the incidence of heart failure by 24% (19% to 28%) and calcium channel blockers by 19% (6% to 31%).",

The proportional reduction in cardiovascular disease events was the same or similar regardless of pretreatment blood pressure and the presence or absence of existing cardiovascular disease. Guidelines on the use of blood pressure lowering drugs can be simplified so that drugs are offered to people with all levels of blood pressure.

    "762": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a common degenerative condition with high mortality in older men. Elective surgical or endovascular repair is performed to prevent rupture of large AAAs. In contrast, despite gradual expansion, small AAAs have a low risk of rupture, and there is currently no well-defined treatment strategy for them. Therefore, a pharmacological approach for AAA is expected in the clinical setting. Indeed, several therapeutic effects of pharmacological agents have been reported in experimental models, and some agents have undergone clinical trials. Treatment with statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitors, antibiotics, and anti-inflammatory agents appears to inhibit the growth rate of AAA in humans. However, as the sample size and follow-up period were limited in these studies, a large randomized study with long-term follow-up of small AAA should be performed to clarify the effect of these agents. Recently, the regression of AAA using molecular pharmacological approaches was reported in experimental studies. The characteristics of these strategies are the regulation of multiple molecular mediators and the signalling networks associated with AAA formation. On the basis of the results of these investigations, it may be possible to repair the injured aortic wall and obtain the remission of AAA using pharmacological therapy.",

Here, we report that the growth factor midkine is what we believe to be a novel regulator of the renin-angiotensin system. The hypertension induced in mice by 5/6 nephrectomy was accompanied by renal damage and elevated plasma angiotensin II levels and was ameliorated by an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and an angiotensin receptor blocker. Notably, ACE activity in the lung, midkine expression in the lung, and midkine levels in the plasma were all increased after 5/6 nephrectomy. Exposure to midkine protein enhanced ACE expression in primary cultured human lung microvascular endothelial cells. Furthermore, hypertension was not induced and renal damage was less severe in midkine-deficient mice. Supplemental administration of midkine protein to midkine-deficient mice restored ACE expression in the lung and hypertension after 5/6 nephrectomy. Oxidative stress might be involved in midkine expression, since expression of NADH/NADPH oxidase-1, -2, and -4 was induced in the lung after 5/6 nephrectomy. Indeed, the antioxidative reagent tempol reduced midkine expression and plasma angiotensin II levels and consequently ameliorated hypertension. These results suggest that midkine regulates the renin-angiotensin system and mediates the kidney-lung interaction after 5/6 nephrectomy.",

First, proteins capable of producing Ile-Pro-Pro from beta-casein were eluted using a DEAE-sepharose FF column with a linear sodium chloride gradient. An endopeptidase capable of releasing Pro-Ile-Pro-Gln-Ser-Leu-Pro-Gln-Asn-Ile-Pro-Pro from Pro-Ile-Pro-Gln-Ser-Leu-Pro-Gln-Asn-Ile-Pro-Pro-Leu-Thr-Gln and an aminopeptidase producing Ile-Pro-Pro from Gln-Asn-Ile-Pro-Pro were separated from the resultant fraction using a hydroxyapatite column. Each active enzyme was then loaded onto a Develosil 300Diol gel filtration column for high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and purified to homogeneity. The endopeptidase had a molecular mass of approximately 46,000 Da and exhibited an N-terminal amino acid sequence identical to that of neutral protease I (NP I) of A. oryzae. Meanwhile, the aminopeptidase had a molecular mass of 36,000 Da and an N-terminal amino acid sequence similar to that of Leucine aminopeptidase (LAP), as reported in Aspergillus sojae and A. oryzae. The eluted endopeptidase and aminopeptidase were thus identified as NP I and LAP, respectively. Analysis of peptide production using synthetic proteins containing an Ile-Pro-Pro sequence showed that NP I processed the C-terminal end and LAP processed the N terminus to produce Ile-Pro-Pro. While Ile-Pro-Pro was successfully produced from casein by the addition of these two purified enzymes, it was not generated with the addition of only a single enzyme. Based on our experimental findings, we suggest that NP I and LAP are key proteolytic enzymes in the release of Ile-Pro-Pro from casein in A. oryzae.",

The drugs were administered orally from the 13th week after surgery. Rats were examined after 12 weeks' treatment with drugs. The parameters of hemodynamics including LVSP, LVEDP, and +/- LVdp/dt(max) were measured. SERCA2a mRNA and protein expressions in left ventricular tissues were determined by half-quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot normalized to abundance of GAPDH mRNA and portein, respectively.",

Both Captopril and As prevented the increase of LVSP (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01) and LVEDP (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). RT-PCR and Western blot results demonstrated that SERCA2a gene expression was downregulated (P < 0.05) significantly in model group compared with sham group.

The area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the postcaptopril plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) was significantly less than that of the postlosartan PAC (0.744 vs. 0.829, P = 0.038). Using an aldosterone-renin ratio (ARR, ng/dl per ng/ml/h) >35 with a PAC >10 ng/dl, the specificity was 89.1% vs. 93.8% and the sensitivity was 66.2% vs. 84.5 % for the captopril test vs. the losartan test, respectively. With respect to the losartan test, the accuracy was 88.9%, the agreement was good (k = 0.778), and there was no disagreement with the McNemar test (P = 0.118). Losartan had the advantage of a better negative predictive value to exclude PA when patients were referred with a serum potassium (SK) level <3.8 mmol/l.

    "813": "Amaranth seed is a valuable source of dietary protein with very high nutritional quality, and recently its potential as a nutraceutical has been proposed. The aim of this work was to provide experimental evidence for the presence of anti-hypertensive peptides in globulin 11S, one of the major constituents of the seed, by means of an in-silico based peptide library screening method. A three-dimensional model of globulin 11S was built, upon which anti-hypertensive peptides were mapped via a database-driven method. Solvent accessibility was evaluated for each potential peptide, and two potent and exposed tripeptides were detected: IKP and LEP. An N-terminal extension of these two peptides was built using the globulin 11S primary sequence information, and ACE inhibitory behaviour was simulated by automated ligand-protein docking. The occurrence of two inhibitory tetrapeptides, ALEP and VIKP, was predicted and experimentally validated by an in vitro ACE inhibition assay that showed IC50 values of 6.32 mM and 175 microM, respectively. This study is the first to provide experimental proof of the anti-hypertensive value of Amaranth. Furthermore, this is the first time that a peptide docking approach is used to find ACE-inhibitory peptides from a food protein source.", 
    "814": "The blood pressure-lowering property of the brady-kinin system has been documented for more than eight decades. The bradykinin system is involved in the mediation and modulation of the vasoconstrictor renin-angiotensin system and the vasodilators prostaglandin, prostacyclin, and nitric oxide in regulating sodium water balance, renal and cardiac hemodynamics, and blood pressure. Reduced activity of the bradykinin system has been observed in various hypertensive situations in both clinical and experimental models of hypertension. Antihypertensive properties of the angiotensin-converting enzyme or kininase II inhibitors are primarily mediated via the bradykinin-releasing pathway, which may also cause regression of left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertensive situations. The ability of kallikrein gene delivery to produce a wide spectrum of beneficial effects makes it an excellent candidate for treating hypertension and cardiovascular and renal diseases. In addition, stable bradykinin agonists may also be available in the future as therapeutic agents for cardio-vascular and renal disorders.", 
    "815": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS), an important control system for blood pressure and intravascular volume, also causes left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and fibrosis. The main causal mechanism is the increase in blood pressure, which leads to increased left ventricular wall stress; however, aldosterone release from the adrenals and (more controversially) the direct action of angiotensin II on the cardiomyocytes also play a role. Large clinical trials evaluating the blockade of the RAS with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers have demonstrated an ability to prevent progression and induce regression of left ventricular mass, thereby reducing the significant and independent cardiovascular risk conferred by LVH. Regression of left ventricular mass is also achieved by other medication classes, but the RAS blockers have an additional beneficial effect for the same blood pressure reduction, for which the mechanism is not entirely clear. Studies comparing the efficacy of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors versus angiotensin receptor blockers to achieve LVH regression have not demonstrated any clear benefit of one class over the other.", 
    "816": "Congestive heart failure (CHF), a complex clinical syndrome with impaired cardiac pump function, occurs as a consequence of mechanical deformities (pressure and volume overload), myocardial abnormalities (neurohormonal disorders, myocarditis, cardiomyopathies, inflammation and loss of cardiomyocytes) and rhythmic defects (conduction disturbances, fibrillation and tachycardia). Several studies have demonstrated that chronic activation of sympathetic and renin-angiotensin systems, alteration in myocardial substrate utilization, increase in intracellular Ca(2+) concentration, development of oxidative stress, release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increased production of endothelin are responsible for the maladaptive cardiac and subcellular remodeling depending upon the type and stage of heart failure. A variety of pharmacological agents have been used to prevent the development and progression of CHF under different experimental and clinical settings. Although these drugs belong to specific classes, depending on their mechanism of action, individual drug biotransformation into different metabolites makes them distinct chemical moieties. Thorough understanding of biological effects of these pharmacological agents and metabolism is necessary to establish the basis for their preeminent use in clinical settings. The purpose of this review is to present a mechanistic understanding for the biological activities of different drugs used to treat CHF and to provide an insight of different metabolites formed after biotransformation of these chemical entities. Since development of CHF is a multifactorial and heterogeneous process, induction of combination regimens and improvement in patient compliance are the major challenges for future drug development.", 
    "817": "This study investigates if the connection between Vaccinium myrtillus and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) might be an explanation of the pharmacological effects on circulation. Cultured endothelial cells from human umbilical veins were incubated with bilberry 25E extract. The main anthocyanidins combined in myrtillin chloride and separately in cyanidin, delphinidin, and malvidin, respectively, were examined concerning their effects on ACE. After 10 min of incubation with bilberry 25E, a significant, dose-dependent inhibition of ACE activity was seen, and after incubation with myrtillin chloride a significant inhibition was seen. No effect was seen with the anthocyanidins. The effect seems to be dependent on this specific mixture of anthocyanins in the bilberry. V. myrtillus may thus have the potential to prevent and protect against cardiovascular diseases.", 
    "818": "In Japan, only about 3% of all patients with end-stage renal disease are maintained by continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Although the reasons for the low proportion of patients receiving CAPD are multifactorial, encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS), a fatal complication of CAPD, is a major factor. In 1995 we developed a rat model of EPS, and in 2001 also developed an EPS model in mice. These rodent EPS models are reliable, reproducible, and inexpensive and have been used by other investigators. The renin-angiotensin system negatively regulates the transforming growth factor-beta signaling pathway, which plays a major role in tissue fibrosis. To investigate the anti-EPS effect of renin-angiotensin system inhibition, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, quinapril, was administered to an EPS model in mice. Quinapril was found to inhibit EPS, both macro- and microscopically, in a dose-dependent manner. We report our experience of developing the experimental in vivo EPS model, and the inhibitory effect of this angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor on EPS.", 
    "819": "A review is given of the various available strategies that can be used to protect the peritoneal membrane. A discussion of experimental studies on approaches that are still experimental, but that might be applied in patients in the future, follows. The currently available approaches include dietary sodium restriction, use of high-dose loop diuretics and of inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system. All should preferably be combined with a dialysis prescription aimed at reducing the patient's exposure to glucose and its degradation products. The experimental studies indicate favorable effects of combining osmotic agents, together with drugs that interfere with the polyol pathway and the formation of advanced glycosylation end-products.", 
    "820": "Molecular modeling and docking studies along with three-dimensional quantitative structure relationships (3D-QSAR) studies have been used to determine the correct binding mode of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta) inhibitors. The approaches of comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) and comparative molecular similarity index analysis (CoMSIA) are used for the 3D-QSAR of 51 substituted benzofuran-3-yl-(indol-3-yl)maleimides as GSK-3beta inhibitors. Two binding modes of the inhibitors to the binding site of GSK-3beta are investigated. The binding mode 1 yielded better 3D-QSAR correlations using both CoMFA and CoMSIA methodologies. The three-component CoMFA model from the steric and electrostatic fields for the experimentally determined pIC(50) values has the following statistics: R(2)(cv) = 0.386 nd SE(cv) = 0.854 for the cross-validation, and R(2) = 0.811 and SE = 0.474 for the fitted correlation. F (3,47) = 67.034, and probability of R(2) = 0 (3,47) = 0.000. The binding mode suggested by the results of this study is consistent with the preliminary results of X-ray crystal structures of inhibitor-bound GSK-3beta. The 3D-QSAR models were used for the estimation of the inhibitory potency of two additional compounds.", 
    "821": "Our view of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has changed over the past two decades: new metabolites and pathways have been described; also the importance of local renin-angiotensin systems became more clearly understood. However, there is relatively scarce information about formation and action of angiotensin peptides in gastrointestinal tract, especially in the stomach. Here, using LC-ESI-MS method we assessed the metabolism of Ang I in organ bath of rat stomach wall. Additionally we compared the expression of mRNA of angiotensin converting enzymes (ACE, ACE2) and neprilysin (NEP) in the stomach, aorta and renal artery in rats. Despite, similar levels of expression of ACE and ACE2 mRNA in stomach wall, aorta and renal artery, the absolute amounts of main Ang I metabolites produced by stomach wall (in ng/mg of dry tissue) were much lower than that produced by aorta and renal artery. Also, the pattern of angiotensin I metabolites was different: opposite to aorta and renal artery, incubation of Ang I with stomach wall fragments resulted in predominant formation of Ang-(1-7) and relatively lower production of Ang II. In stomach wall both, perindoprilat and tiorphan decreased production of Ang II, but did not influence generation of Ang-(1-7). In conclusion, we identified Ang-(1-7) as the main product of Ang I conversion in rat stomach wall. The biological role of prevalence of Ang-(1-7) formation in stomach require further investigation.", 
    "822": "Little is known about the epidemiology of stroke in chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure (HF) patients in normal sinus rhythm (NSR) receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Because all HF patients in the Digitalis Investigation Group (DIG) trial (N=7788) were in NSR and nearly all were receiving ACE inhibitors, a survey-based stroke-sub-study was conducted but its findings have never been published.",

    "825": "Older age, hypertension, diabetes and cardiomegaly were associated with increased incidence of stroke among HF patients with NSR receiving ACE inhibitors. The association of race and stroke, however, was complex. While nonwhite race was associated with decreased risk of stroke, among those with stroke, nonwhite race was associated with increased stroke severity and mortality.", 
    "826": "Therapeutic traditions at health care practices (HCPs) influence physicians' adherence to prescription guidelines for specific drugs, however, it is not known if such traditions affect all kinds of prescriptions or only specific types of drug. Our goal was to determine whether adherence to prescription guidelines is a common trait of HCPs or dependent on drug type.", 
    "827": "We fitted separate multi-level logistic regression models to all patients in the Sk\u00e5ne region who received a prescription for a statin drug (ATC: C10AA, n = 6232), an agent acting on the renin-angiotensin system (ATC: C09, n = 7222) or a proton pump inhibitor (ATC: A02BC, n = 11 563) at 198 HCPs from July 2006 to December 2006.",

Compared with HCPs with low adherence to guidelines in two drug types, those HCPs with the highest level of adherence for these two drug types also showed a higher probability of adherence for the third drug type.", 
    "829": "Physicians' decisions to follow prescription guidelines seem to be influenced by therapeutic traditions at the HCP. Moreover, these therapeutic traditions seem to affect all kinds of prescriptions. This information can be used as basis for interventions to support rational and cost-effective medication use.", 
    "830": "The renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) plays an important role in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) have proven benefit in reducing cardiovascular events in patients at high risk. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) have been demonstrated to have benefit in the management of heart failure and to be non-inferior to ACEi in patients with left ventricular dysfunction after a myocardial infarction (MI). Yet until now, there has been no trial to support the use of the ARB for vascular protection. The ONTARGET study showed that the ARB telmisartan conserved 95% of the vascular protective properties of the ACEi ramipril, given at similar doses to a similar patient group as had been previously shownin the HOPE study to benefit from ACE inhibition with ramipril. The TRANSCEND study in a similar population of patients who were intolerant of ACEi despite the primary endpoint being neutral, showed a trend to a benefit for the combined secondary endpoint of cardiovascular death, MI and stroke, with excellent tolerance of the ARB. The reasons for neutral result of the TRANSCEND study result include an underpowered study, and pre-treatment with a RAAS inhibitor in a high proportion of patients. These studies indicate that an ARB can be used for vascular protection in high risk individuals in the place of an ACEi. However ACEi will probably remain the first choice due to the greater body of supportive evidence.", 
    "831": "The prevalence of heart failure is ever increasing around the world, particularly due to aging populations. Despite improvements in treatment over the last 20 years, the prognosis for heart failure remains poor. Among the treatments recommended for chronic heart failure, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blockers are crucial, provided of course that they are not contraindicated. However, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) can also be a beneficial treatment option. Candesartan is a particular ARB, characterized by a strong binding affinity to the angiotensin II type 1 receptor and slow dissociation. The benefits of candesartan have been demonstrated by the CHARM programme, which showed that candesartan significantly reduces the incidence of cardiovascular death, hospital admissions for decompensated heart failure, and all-cause mortality in chronic heart failure patients with altered left ventricular systolic function, when added to standard therapies or as an alternative to ACE inhibitors when these are poorly tolerated. Furthermore, candesartan can protect against myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation and diabetes. Tolerance to candesartan is good, but blood pressure and serum potassium and creatinine levels must be monitored.", 
    "832": "To investigate whether change in objective signs during up-titration of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors in patients with chronic heart failure affect perception of information about medicines and subjective activities such as self-care.", 
    "833": "Consecutive patients referred for up-titration of ACE-inhibitors were included. Patients were given the Satisfaction with Information about Medicines Scale and the European Heart Failure Self-Care Behaviour Scale at their first visit and when the target dose was reached. Blood pressure, pulse and s-creatinine were measured at each visit.", 
    "834": "Relationships were found between change in systolic (r = 0.224, p = 0.044) and diastolic (r = 0.361, p = 0.001) blood pressure and change in self-care scores and were also observed at baseline (r = 0.324, 0.398, p = 0.001, 0.000) and follow-up (r = 0.317, 0.253, p = 0.004, 0.022). Diastolic blood pressure correlated with the \"potential problem of medication\" score (r= -0.263, p = 0.007).", 
    "835": "Patients with a more advanced disease usually have a lower blood pressure. Hence, the relationship between blood pressure and self-care scores might indicate that patients are more motivated to adhere to prescriptions the more advanced the stage of their disease.", 
    "836": "Inhibition of soluble epoxide hydrolase (SEH), the enzyme responsible for degradation of vasoactive epoxides, protects against cerebral ischemia in rats. However, the molecular and biological mechanisms that confer protection in normotension and hypertension remain unclear. Here we show that 6 weeks of SEH inhibition via 2 mg/day of 12-(3-adamantan-1-yl-ureido) dodecanoic acid (AUDA) in spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone (SHRSP) rats protects against cerebral ischemia induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion, reducing percent hemispheric infarct and neurodeficit score without decreasing blood pressure. This level of cerebral protection was similar to that of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril, which significantly lowered blood pressure. SEH inhibition is also protective in normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats, reducing both hemispheric infarct and neurodeficit score. In SHRSP rats, SEH inhibition reduced wall-to-lumen ratio and collagen deposition and increased cerebral microvessel density, although AUDA did not alter middle cerebral artery structure or microvessel density in WKY rats. An apoptosis mRNA expression microarray of brain tissues from AUDA-treated rats revealed that AUDA modulates gene expression of mediators involved in the regulation of apoptosis in neural tissues of both WKY and SHRSP rats. Hence, we conclude that chronic SEH inhibition protects against cerebral ischemia via vascular protection in SHRSP rats and neural protection in both the SHRSP and WKY rats, indicating that SEH inhibition has broad pharmacological potential for treating ischemic stroke.", 
    "837": "Current therapies proven to slow the progression of diabetic nephropathy include blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) with either angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. Given our better understanding of the pathophysiology of diabetic nephropathy, newer therapies to treat this condition are slowly emerging.", 
    "838": "Animal studies and a single clinical trial demonstrate efficacy of the renin inhibitor, aliskiren, to decrease a marker of nephropathy progression, that is albuminuria. On the basis of animal study results, pyridoxamine, an inhibitor of advanced glycation and ruboxistaurin, a protein kinase C inhibitor showed promise as new agent to treat nephropathy. The clinical trial results were less than gratifying, however. Sulodexide, a glycosaminoglycan, works to reduce proteinuria presumably by restoring the already reduced glycoproteins present in the glomerular basement membrane. Like other agents, sulodexide also looked promising in animal studies, but failed to demonstrate albuminuria reduction in a large multicentre clinical trial (SUN-Micro-Trial).", 
    "839": "This review summarizes newer therapies for slowing the progression of diabetic nephropathy. Aliskiren shows promise from small clinical studies, but we await the results of the multicentre, international ALTITUDE trial in about 2012.

    "840": "Inadvertent or intentional metformin overdose can result in death from refractory lactic acidosis. We report a death from metformin-induced refractory lactic acidosis despite aggressive care. A 49-year-old hypertensive diabetic female presented 1 hour after ingesting 60 tablets of 500 mg metformin and 20 combination tablets of 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide/20 mg lisinopril. She was awake and alert, with a blood glucose of 579 mg/dL. Chemistry panel revealed lactic acidosis and acute renal failure (arterial blood gas pH, 7.18; pCO(2), 15 mm Hg; pO(2), 127 mm Hg; HCO(3), 6 mmol/L; lactate, 9.6 mmol/L; and creatinine, 1.2 mg/dL [0.8 mg/dL previously]). She received normal saline, sodium bicarbonate, and insulin. On arrival to the intensive care unit she was obtunded, with a blood pressure of 40/25 mm Hg and had worsening acidosis and poor oxygenation (arterial blood gas pH, 6.79; pCO(2), 55; pO(2), 57; HCO(3), 8.4; and base excess of -25 on 100% fractional inspired oxygen). She was intubated and received additional fluid boluses, bicarbonate, and norepinephrine. Continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) was started 6 hours after her ingestion. Metformin was 380 microg/mL on CVVH initiation. The patient developed pulseless electrical activity 30 hours after her ingestion, which recurred 20 minutes later. The family requested no further resuscitation. She died 31.5 hours after her ingestion. Metformin concentrations decreased to 97 microg/mL 28 hours after the ingestion on CVVH, with a first-order elimination half-life of 11.3 hours (r(2) = 0.99) and a clearance of 56.2 mL/min. Further investigations on the place of CVVH in the management of the poisoned patient with MALA unable to hemodynamically tolerate conventional hemodialysis may be needed.", 
    "841": "With the arrival of a new class of drugs for the management of hypertension comes the need to define its role. Aliskiren, an orally administered direct renin inhibitor, has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of hypertension. Currently, the recommendation for choice of agent in the treatment of uncomplicated hypertension is a thiazide diuretic, and for patients with diabetic nephropathy, heart failure, or coronary artery disease, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Patients for whom an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor is indicated who are intolerant as a result of side effects should take an angiotensin receptor blocker. A new class of medicines that specifically inhibits renin is an exciting addition to the armamentarium in the treatment of hypertension. This article explores the role of aliskiren in treating hypertension as well as its side effects and appropriate dosing.", 
    "842": "Clinical studies have demonstrated a different effect on blood pressure of some angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors when administered in the morning versus the evening. Their administration at bedtime resulted in a higher effect on nighttime blood pressure as compared with morning dosing. This study investigated the administration time-dependent effects of ramipril on ambulatory blood pressure. We studied 115 untreated hypertensive patients, 46.7+/-11.2 years of age, randomly assigned to receive ramipril (5 mg/d) as a monotherapy either on awakening or at bedtime. Blood pressure was measured for 48 hours before and after 6 weeks of treatment. The blood pressure reduction during diurnal activity was similar for both treatment times. Bedtime administration of ramipril, however, was significantly more efficient than morning administration in reducing asleep blood pressure. The awake:asleep blood pressure ratio was decreased after ramipril on awakening but significantly increased toward a more dipping pattern after bedtime dosing. The proportion of patients with controlled ambulatory blood pressure increased from 43% to 65% (P=0.019) with bedtime treatment. Nocturnal blood pressure regulation is significantly better achieved at bedtime as compared with morning administration of ramipril, without any loss in efficacy during diurnal active hours. This might be clinically important, because nighttime blood pressure has been shown to be a more relevant marker of cardiovascular risk than diurnal mean values. The change in the dose-response curve, increased proportion of controlled patients, and improved efficacy on nighttime blood pressure with administration of ramipril at bedtime should be taken into account when prescribing this angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor for treatment of essential hypertension.", 
    "843": "The Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) is reevaluated considering information from new clinical trials, meta-analyses, and recent subgroup and explanatory analyses from ALLHAT, especially those regarding heart failure (HF) and the association of drug treatment with new-onset diabetes mellitus (DM) and its cardiovascular disease (CVD) consequences. Chlorthalidone was superior to (1) doxazosin mesylate in preventing combined CVD (CCVD) (risk ratio [RR], 1.20; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.13-1.27), especially HF (RR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.40-2.22) and stroke (RR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.10-1.46); (2) lisinopril in preventing CCVD (RR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.05-1.16), including stroke (in black persons only) and HF (RR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.09-1.34); and (3) amlodipine besylate in preventing HF, overall (by 28%) and in hospitalized or fatal cases (by 26%). Central independent blinded reassessment of HF hospitalizations confirmed each comparison. Results were consistent by age, sex, race (except for stroke and CCVD), DM status, metabolic syndrome status, and renal function level. Neither amlodipine nor lisinopril was superior to chlorthalidone in preventing end-stage renal disease overall, by DM status, or by renal function level. In the chlorthalidone arm, new-onset DM was not significantly associated with CCVD (RR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.88-2.42). Evidence from subsequent analyses of ALLHAT and other clinical outcome trials confirm that neither alpha-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, nor calcium channel blockers surpass thiazide-type diuretics (at appropriate dosage) as initial therapy for reduction of cardiovascular or renal risk. Thiazides are superior in preventing HF, and new-onset DM associated with thiazides does not increase CVD outcomes.",

Most patients develop DCM as part of the disease course; in fact, DCM is the leading cause of death among these patients. Cardiac surveillance, including routine monitoring of electrocardiograms, echocardiograms, and appropriate blood biomarkers, may detect early DCM development. Although previous studies have shown that early administration of cardiac medications may delay the development of DCM, current standard of care does not emphasize cardiac surveillance and timely treatment. This, in turn, limits clinicians, including advanced practice nurses, to be optimally engaged in providing the most aggressive and proactive patient care.",

The eyedrops were administered to rabbits and intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured at various time intervals after the administration and the results (mean of 10 experiments +/- standard error of the mean) are expressed as the change from baseline (24.7 +/- 3.3 mmHg).",

The maximum decline in IOP after topical administration of one drop of 2.9% enalaprilat solution was 6.2 +/- 0.7 mmHg at 4 hours after administration. Duration of activity exceeded 10 hours. A 1% enalaprilat solution lowered IOP by 4.4 +/- 0.8 mmHg at 4 hours after administration and had similar duration, and was more potent than 0.5% timolol.

In those cases, high renin levels are thought to be secondary to renal involvement. The present study was performed to identify causal factors of polyarteritis nodosa. In cyp1a1ren-2 transgenic rats, vasculitis of medium-sized arteries resembling classical polyarteritis nodosa can be induced. In this model, oral administration of indole-3-carbinol (I3C) activates the liver-specific cyp1a1 promoter, leading to prorenin expression in a dose-dependent manner. After the first 6 weeks of chronic induction with 0.125% I3C, the mean arterial pressure reached a plateau of about 170 mmHg. Ten out of 11 I3C-treated rats, which were chronically instrumented with a telemetric device to measure blood pressure, developed polyarteritis nodosa within 10 weeks of I3C treatment. I3C alone or instrumentation alone did not cause polyarteritis nodosa. The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril completely prevented the development of polyarteritis nodosa, indicating that local angiotensin II generation is a pathogenetic factor in this model. The renin-angiotensin system can play a primary role in the development of polyarteritis nodosa in rats.", 
    "853": "Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) remains the leading cause of mortality in the world. Early intervention using salvianolic acids (SA) can substantially improve clinical outcomes. However, in spite of the great achievements that have been made in elucidating the protective effects of SA on AMI, the effects of SA on the contractile performance of the left ventricle (LV) and the underlying mechanism are still not so clear. In the present study, AMI was introduced by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery near the main pulmonary artery. Administration of SA significantly decreased infarct size, improved LV function and appearance of the myocardium and decreased myocardial malondialdehyde levels compared with the AMI group. Furthermore, treatment with SA significantly downregulated the mRNA expression level and activity of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), but did not regulate the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) expression level at the infarct area. Lisinopril (an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor), which holds potential effects on cardioprotection, was chosen as the positive control in this study. Lisinopril elevated LV function and appearance of the myocardium, decreased malondialdehyde levels without an influence on infarct size, and regulated the MMP-9 enzyme level but not the MMP-9 mRNA and TIMP-1 protein levels. These findings suggest that early SA treatment is effective to improve LV function; and SA may exert preventative effects against myocardial remodeling after infarction.",

It was shown that monotherapy with indapamide lowered systolic and diastolic arterial pressure and allowed to achieve full normalization of arterial pressure in 36,4+/-6,55% of cases. Monotherapy with perindopril also lowered systolic and diastolic arterial pressure and allowed to achieve full normalization of arterial pressure in 37,5+/-6,53% of cases (>0,05).

Angiotensin II (AngII) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are known to regulate heparanase expression in vivo. However, it is unknown whether this is also the case for aldosterone. Therefore, we further assessed the role of aldosterone, AngII and ROS in the regulation of glomerular heparanase expression.",

Age-matched healthy rats served as controls (n = 6). After 18 weeks, renal heparanase and heparan sulfate (HS) expression were examined by immunofluorescence staining. In addition, the effect of aldosterone, AngII and ROS on heparanase expression in cultured podocytes was determined.", 
    "858": "Treatment with lisinopril, spironolactone or their combination significantly blunted the increased glomerular heparanase expression and restored the decreased HS expression in the GBM.

Heparanase mRNA and protein expression in podocytes were also significantly increased after stimulation with AngII or ROS.",

    "860": "Men exhibit a higher incidence of cardiovascular diseases than do women. The cardiovascular actions of sex steroids have been suggested as primary factors in mediating this sex difference. The mechanisms by which sex steroids, androgens and estrogens, mediate cardiovascular actions remain unclear. Excess aldosterone secretion has been associated with cardiovascular diseases. The hypothesis tested in this study was that at physiological concentrations, androgens stimulate and estradiol inhibits aldosterone secretion by human adrenal cells. In contrast to our hypothesis, physiological concentrations of sex steroids did not modify aldosterone secretion by H295R human adrenocortical cells. However, supraphysiological concentrations (300-1000 nM) of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) significantly stimulated basal and Angiotensin II-mediated aldosterone secretion. The stimulatory effect of DHT on aldosterone secretion was not blocked by the classical androgen receptor blocker flutamide. The stimulatory effect of DHT on aldosterone secretion was also independent of the intra-adrenal renin-angiotensin system since it was neither modified by treatment with the Angiotensin II receptor type 1 blocker losartan or the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril. Inhibitors of the calmodulin/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) and protein kinase C intracellular signaling pathways abolished the DHT stimulatory effect on aldosterone secretion by H295R cells. In conclusion, physiological concentrations of sex steroids did not modify aldosterone secretion by human adrenal cells. However, supraphysiological concentrations of DHT-stimulated aldosterone secretion by human adrenal cells by the calmodulin/CaMK and protein kinase C intracellular signaling pathways but independently of the classical androgen receptor. Supraphysiological doses of androgen may promote cardiovascular diseases via stimulation of aldosterone secretion.",

Nephropathy is one of the major complications of diabetes mellitus, and the morbidity and mortality due to diabetic nephropathy is constantly progressing in industrialized nations. No satisfactory therapeutic option is currently available to treat patients with nephropathy except for fewer agents like angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin AT(1) receptor blockers and few antioxidants, which have been shown to improve the function of diabetic kidney to some extent. Thus, tremendous efforts are being made to explore promising therapeutic interventions to treat diabetic nephropathy. This review discussed various presently employed and recently developed pharmacological interventions to treat diabetic nephropathy and to improve the function of diabetic kidney. In addition, the recently identified potential target sites involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy have been delineated.", 
    "867": "We evaluated the long-term changes on overt proteinuria induced by dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Dual blockade was produced by adding an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) to treatment with maximal recommended doses of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor in proteinuric patients. A total of 28 patients (19 men and 9 women) with proteinuria higher than 1 g/24 h were enrolled in this trial of treatment with the ARB candesartan (from 4 up to 32 mg daily) added to existing treatment with an ACE inhibitor. At 6, 12, 24, and 36 months, we evaluated proteinuria in 24-h urinary collections, office blood pressure (BP), plasmatic creatinine (Cr), serum potassium (K), and 24 h urine collection creatinine clearance (CrC). During monoblockade of the RAS by ACE inhibitor treatment, albuminuria was 2.94 +/- 1.92 mg/24 h; BP was 137/76 mmHg; K+ was 4.8 +/- 0.5 mmol/l, Cr was 1.76 +/- 0.67 mg/dL, and CrC was 62 +/- 31.9 mL/min. After 6 months, dual blockade of the RAS albuminuria was 2.18 +/- 2.29 mg/24 h (P < 0.01 vs. baseline) and BP was 133/75 mmHg (not significant). At 36 months, albuminuria was 2.21 +/- 2.20 mg/24 h (P < 0.05 vs. baseline); BP was 133/73 mmHg (not significant). CrC was not changed along the follow up. A small increment of Cr was detected at 24 months (2.11 +/- 1.06 mg/mL, P < 0.05). The antiproteinuric effect of dual renin-angiotensin system blockade combining candesartan and ACE inhibitors remain after 36 months without losing its initial effect. Blood pressure changes seem not to explain this long-term antiproteinuric effect.", 
    "868": "Echocardiographically documented tricuspid valve regurgitation appeared immediately after surgical treatment of cor triatriatum dexter in a two-month-old rottweiler. Medical treatment was instituted with benazepril, spironolactone and furosemide. Pimobendan was added after five months, and all treatment was discontinued two months later when clinical signs of ascites and hepatomegaly had resolved and tricuspid valve regurgitation was markedly reduced on echocardiography. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report describing the development and spontaneous improvement of haemodynamically significant tricuspid valve regurgitation following surgical treatment of cor triatriatum dexter in a dog. It is hypothesised that the increase in right atrial volume and pressure following cor triatriatum dexter repair and transient ischaemia of papillary muscles led to dilatation of the right atrioventricular annulus and subsequent severe tricuspid valve regurgitation in the face of an anatomically normal valve. Time and pharmacological preload reduction as well as normalisation of right atrial inflow and subsequent cardiac remodelling substantially reduced tricuspid valve regurgitation and eliminated clinical signs of heart failure. It is also possible that heart recovery has been spontaneous.", 
    "869": "Affinity CE (ACE) was used to study interactions of small, highly sulfated, aromatic molecules with antithrombin (AT). The high charge density of the small molecules induces differential migration of the complex resulting in a versatile method of assessing binding affinities, nature of interactions and site of binding on the inhibitor. Scatchard analysis of the interaction of three tetrahydroisoquinoline-based polysulfated molecules with AT results in monophasic profiles with affinities in the range of 40-60 microM in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. For a pentasulfated molecule, a biphasic profile with affinities of 4.7 and 30 microM was observed. Measurement of K(D) as a function of ionic strength of the medium indicated that ionic and non-ionic forces contribute 2.4 and 1.9 kcal/mol, respectively, at pH 7.4 and 100 mM NaCl. Competitive binding studies showed that the tetrahydroisoquinoline-based molecules do not compete with a high-affinity heparin pentasaccharide. In contrast, the affinity of these tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives decreases dramatically in the presence of an extended heparin-binding site ligand. Overall, ACE analysis of small, sulfated aromatic molecules interacting with AT is relatively easy and obviates the need for an external signal, e.g. fluorescence, for monitoring the interaction. In addition to affording biochemical knowledge, the small sample requirement and fast analysis time of ACE could be particularly advantageous for high-throughput screening of potential anticoagulants.",

The possibility that central systolic and pulse pressure (PP) reduction differs between the two drug classes for the same mean BP (MBP) has never been explored. Our aim was to compare carotid PP at the same MBP obtained with the CEB, amlodipine, and the ACEI, trandolapril, in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), and to evaluate the resulting changes of fibronectin (Fn) and its integrin alpha5beta1 receptor on central PP and arterial stiffness.", 
    "875": "Amlodipine and trandolapril were administered chronically to achieve the same MBP. Carotid arterial systolic BP (SBP) and PP, diameter and incremental elastic modulus (E(inc)) were determined using echo Doppler techniques, and complemented with vascular histomorphometry, and Fn and alpha5beta1-integrin immunolabeling.", 
    "876": "Both drugs produced the same MBP, carotid wall thickness, and stress. Trandolapril reduced PP and E(inc) significantly more than amlodipine, while both agents comparably lowered EIIIA-Fn. Total Fn and alpha-subunit were lowered significantly by trandolapril, but unaffected by amlodipine, indicating that ACEI alone contributed to both diminished carotid stiffness and decrease of the Fn-integrin complex.", 
    "877": "Results showed that amlodipine and trandolapril have different effects on carotid mechanical properties for comparable MBP reduction. Changes in Fn-integrin complex not only modify consistently ACEI mechanotransduction but also are associated with selective central PP reduction. Whether this property has consequences on cardiovascular (CV) risk remains to be investigated.",

Between 25% and 30% of these patients will be anemic at some time after transplantation. In addition to impaired kidney function, other factors may also play a role in the pathogenesis of posttransplant anemia: immunosuppressive agents such as azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, and sirolimus; angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-II receptor antagonists; impaired iron homeostasis; and donor and recipient age. There is a controversy on whether posttransplant anemia has the same negative effects on morbidity and mortality as in nontransplanted patients with chronic kidney disease and data on whether correction of anemia are beneficial or lacking. Anemia check-up should be part of the long-term follow-up of the renal transplant patients. Controlled trials should investigate the impact of a better control of anemia on the patient morbidity and outcome.",

    "880": "The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene is a potential candidate gene for risk of asthma, COPD, and COPD co-morbidity. In 9034 Danish adults, we determined whether individuals homozygous or heterozygous for the ACE D allele are at greater risk of asthma, COPD, or COPD co-morbidity compared with ACE II homozygous individuals. In the general population, serum ACE activity increased with the number of D alleles (Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA: II vs. ID, p<0.001; ID vs. DD, p<0.001); however, this did not translate into altered risk of asthma or COPD. In the general population, the odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for asthma was 1.2 (0.9-1.4) for ID individuals and 1.2 (0.9-1.5) for DD individuals compared with II individuals. In the general population, the odds ratio for COPD was 0.9 (0.8-1.1) for ID individuals and 1.0 (0.8-1.2) for DD individuals compared with II individuals. Among patients with COPD, the odds ratio for ischemic heart disease was 1.1 (0.8-1.6) for ID individuals and 1.2 (0.8-1.7) for DD individuals compared with II individuals; corresponding odds ratios for hypertension were 1.1 (0.7-1.5) and 0.8 (0.5-1.2), and for low physical activity 0.9 (0.5-1.4) and 0.7 (0.4-1.2). The results were similar upon adjustment for sex, age, smoking status, body mass index, total cholesterol, and ACE inhibitor/angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker use. These data suggest that lifelong genetically elevated ACE activity is not a major risk factor for asthma or COPD, or for ischemic heart disease, hypertension, and low physical activity in COPD patients.", 
    "881": "Anthracycline-based antineoplastic therapy is the standard of care for various cancers today and represents a breakthrough in this area. The cardiac toxicity of anthracyclines is well established. The acute form is often reversible and has no predictive value for the future. This early form does not prevent continuation of chemotherapy. Late cardiac toxicity due to anthracycline is the leading limiting factor in its use. In adults, this resembles dilated cardiomyopathy, while in children it may be expressed as restrictive cardiomyopathy. The discovery of modifiable risk factors has made it possible to identify patients at high risk of developing late cardiac toxicity and heart failure. Because left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure may develop long after anthracycline treatment ends, prolonged close follow-up is mandatory in asymptomatic subjects. Follow-up of asymptomatic patients requires serial echocardiography (M-mode, 2D echo, Doppler, tissue Doppler, speckle tracking, etc.). Anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy must be treated according to the standard guidelines for chronic heart failure with left ventricular dysfunction, by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blockers. Lifestyle changes may reduce the long-term risk. Close collaboration between cardiologists and oncologists is highly desirable for optimizing management of these patients.",

    "899": "Goal of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of amlodipine with enalaprile in case of patients with moderate essential arterial hypertension. Study involved 40 patients with hypertension, 22 males and 18 females, age 39-80 years. Diastolic blood pressure was from 100-120 mmHg. Patients were for two weeks without any therapy and after that were divided into two groups of 20, fortherapy with amlodipine or enalaprile. The patients received 5-10 mg of amlodipine or enalaprile once daily. Initial blood pressure, before therapy was similar in groups, 173.00/108.00 mmHg and 175.25/106.75 mmHg (mean value). After four weeks on treatment the BP was reduced in both groups, in group on amlodipine from 173.00/108.00 to 129.75/78.50 mmHg (mean value), and in the group on enalaprile from 175.25/106.75 to 133.50/81.50 mmHg. Patients did not report any side effects in either of the groups. We prove that one day therapy with small doses, 5-10 mg of amlodipine, new calcium channels blocker and enalaprile, ACE inhibitor were efficient and safe in therapy of the essential hypertension. We found that amlodipine was somewhat more efficient than enalaprile in lowering the blood pressure.",

For the pharmacological management of hypertension, treatment thresholds and targets should be predicated on by the patient's global atherosclerotic risk, target organ damage and comorbid conditions. Blood pressure should be decreased to lower than 140/90 mmHg in all patients, and to lower than 130/80 mmHg in those with diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease. Most patients will require more than one agent to achieve these target blood pressures. Antihypertensive therapy should be considered in all adult patients regardless of age (caution should be exercised in elderly patients who are frail). For adults without compelling indications for other agents, initial therapy should include thiazide diuretics. Other agents appropriate for first-line therapy for diastolic and/or systolic hypertension include angiotensin- converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (in patients who are not black), long-acting calcium channel blockers (CCBs), angiotensin receptor antagonists (ARBs) or beta-blockers (in those younger than 60 years of age). A combination of two first-line agents may also be considered as the initial treatment of hypertension if the systolic blood pressure is 20 mmHg above the target or if the diastolic blood pressure is 10 mmHg above the target. The combination of ACE inhibitors and ARBs should not be used. Other agents appropriate for first-line therapy for isolated systolic hypertension include long- acting dihydropyridine CCBs or ARBs. In patients with angina, recent myocardial infarction or heart failure, beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors are recommended as first-line therapy; in patients with cerebrovascular disease, an ACE inhibitor/diuretic combination is preferred; in patients with proteinuric nondiabetic chronic kidney disease, ACE inhibitors or ARBs (if intolerant to ACE inhibitors) are recommended; and in patients with diabetes mellitus, ACE inhibitors or ARBs (or, in patients without albuminuria, thiazides or dihydropyridine CCBs) are appropriate first-line therapies. All hypertensive patients with dyslipidemia should be treated using the thresholds, targets and agents outlined in the Canadian Cardiovascular Society position statement (recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of dyslipidemia and prevention of cardiovascular disease).

To our knowledge, there are no published data investigating the use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors for 5-Fluorouracil-associated cardiotoxicity. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the influence of 5-FU administration on the diameter of the brachial artery and the levels of angiotensin II. The patients were administered bolus 5-FU/leucovorin in the study group. Angiotensin II and troponin T assays, complete blood cell counts, hepatic and renal function tests were analyzed in five consecutive blood samples in the initiation, just after termination, and on 24, 48, and 72 h after termination of the regimen. Pre- and post-treatment angiotensin II and troponin T assays, complete blood cell counts, hepatic and renal function tests were also analyzed in the control group. Brachial arterial diameters were measured and recorded in all patients before and after the treatment. A total of 59 patients were included in this study. Thirty one out of 59 patients (52.5%) were in the 5-FU study group and the remaining 28 patients (47.5%) were in the control group. Basal and post-treatment brachial artery diameters in the 5-FU study group were 0.436 +/- 0.51 and 0.423 +/- 0.50 cm, respectively (P = 0.001). The corresponding values in the controls were 0.3954 +/- 0.50 and 0.3957 +/- 0.49 cm, basal and post-treatment, respectively (P = 0.979). Angiotensin II levels were not changed significantly at serial measurements (P = 0.496). Moreover, the corresponding measurements were not statistically different in both two groups treated with and without 5-FU (P = 0.372). The pathophysiology of 5-FU-induced cardiac toxicity has not yet been elucidated. In the present study, 5-FU-associated vasoconstriction was not dependent on angiotensin II levels, thus we suggest that the prophylactic administration of ACE inhibitors cannot prevent cardiotoxicity in these patients. The underlying mechanisms of cardiotoxicity related to 5-FU might be multifactorial; nevertheless, further prospective investigation for the toxic effects of fluoropyrimidines on the coronary endothelium and myocardium are needed.",

Unlike the superior mesenteric artery, EDHF relaxations in muscular mesenteric arteries were not reduced in SHRs, although morphological differences were found in the endothelium and smooth muscle. In WKY rats, SHRs and enalapril-treated SHRs, relaxations were mediated by small-, large-, and intermediate-conductance calcium-activated potassium channels, which were distributed in the endothelium, smooth muscle, and both layers, respectively. However, only WKY hyperpolarizations and relaxations were sensitive to gap junction blockers, and these arteries expressed more endothelial and myoendothelial gap junctions than arteries from SHRs. Responses in WKY rats, but not SHRs, were also reduced by inhibitors of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), 14,15-epoxyeicosa-5(Z)-enoic acid (14,15-EEZE) and miconazole, although sensitivity to EET regioisomers was endothelium-independent in all rats. Enalapril treatment of SHRs reduced blood pressure and restored sensitivity to 14,15-EEZE, but not to gap junction blockers, and failed to reverse the morphological changes. In conclusion, the mechanisms underlying EDHF in muscular mesenteric arteries differ between WKY rats and SHRs, with gap junctions and EETs involved only in WKY rats. However, reduction of blood pressure in SHRs with enalapril restored a role for EETs, but not gap junctions, without reversing morphological changes, suggesting a differential control of chemical and structural alterations.",

Consequently, derivatization enhances sample stability and detection sensitivity. Addition of the internal standard was made immediately after plasma preparation.

It is most commonly caused by the inability of narrowed atherosclerotic coronary arteries to supply adequate oxygen to the heart under conditions of increase demand. This review article will focus in the medical treatment of chronic stable angina, with a focus in new strategies or medications. Treatment by revascularization techniques will not be discussed in this article. The goal of treatment is to improve quality of life, decrease cardiovascular events and mortality. All patients should be evaluated for reversible causes of their angina, such as anemia, hyperthyroidism, sympathomimetic drugs and hypertension. Sublingual nitroglycerin should be used for immediate relief of symptoms. In general, all patients should be on aspirin (ASA) unless they are allergic or other contraindications, if so; clopidogrel should be added to the therapy. In addition to the antiplatelet therapy, which decreases mortality, patients should be started on beta blockers and nitrates. If there is no improvement in symptoms then a calcium channel blockers of the dihydropyridine family should be added. Patients with Diabetes Mellitus and/or left ventricular systolic dysfunction should be also started on angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. If the patient continues with limiting angina, ranolazine should be started and finally enhanced external counterpulsation should be considered in those patients who have not responded to maximal drug therapy.",

A three-factor, three-level Box-Behnken design was used to optimize the independent variables, Carbopol 971 P (X(1)), menthol (X(2)), and propylene glycol (X(3)). Fifteen batches were prepared and evaluated for responses as dependent variables. The dependent variables selected were cumulative amount permeated across rat abdominal skin in 24 h (Q (24); Y(1)), flux (Y(2)), and lag time (Y(3)). Aloe juice has been first time investigated as vehicle for hydrogel preparation. The ex vivo permeation study was conducted using Franz diffusion cells. Mathematical equations and response surface plots were used to relate the dependent and independent variables. The regression equation generated for the cumulative permeation of LSP in 24 h (Q(24)) was Y(1) = 1,443.3-602.59X(1) + 93.24X(2) + 91.75X(3) - 18.95X(1)X(2) - 140.93X(1)X(3) - 4.43X(2)X(3) - 152.63X(1)(2) - 150.03X(2)(2) - 213.9X(3)(2).

The process further developed in our study was the construction of six-repeated ACE-IP synthetic genes and their direct insertion. Protein expression in inclusion bodies was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Acid hydrolysis of inclusion bodies produced single-unit peptides through cleavage of the aspartyl-prolyl bonds. This cleaved recombinant peptide (rACE-IP) was purified using immuno-affinity chromatography followed by reversed phase-HPLC. 105-115 mg of the lyophilized recombinant peptide was obtained from 1 L E. coli culture. In vitro biological activity of rACE-IP was indistinguishable from that of the natural peptide produced by hydrolysis in artificial gastric juice or by acidic hydrolysis. The rACE-IP prepared by recombinant DNA technology and solid-phase synthesis methods showed a similar IC(50).

The exact cause of deterioration of kidney function and the mechanism underlying this interaction are complex, multifactorial in nature, and still not completely understood. Both the heart and the kidney act in tandem to regulate blood pressure, vascular tone, diuresis, natriuresis, etc. An extension to the Guytonian model of volume and blood pressure control is proposed called cardiorenal connection. Regulating actions of Guyton's model were coupled to their extended actions on structure and function of the heart and the kidney changes in the rennin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, the imbalance between nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species, the sympathetic nervous system, and inflammation are the cardiorenal connectors to develop cardiorenal syndrome. Imbalance in this closed complex will often lead to deterioration of both cardiac and kidney function. The World Congress of Nephrology emphasized vast interrelated derangements that can occur in cardiorenal syndrome and proposed that the recent definition of cardiorenal syndrome be modified into categories whose labels reflect the likely primary and secondary pathology and time frame. For management, drugs that impair kidney function are undesirable, particularly in a population with already compromised or at risk of kidney function. In severe volume-loaded patients who are refractory to diuretics, management of cardiorenal dysfunction is challenging.

This article addresses the complex interplay between AF and CHF with regards to shared mechanisms, effects on prognosis, management issues and available, pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapeutic options.", 
    "1008": "Certain patient populations have a high prevalence of hypertension, including black, elderly, or obese patients; patients with metabolic syndrome, or frank diabetes; and patients with chronic kidney disease. Many of these patients experience renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) dysregulation, which is important because the RAAS plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and renal dysfunction. Data available regarding newer approaches that target the RAAS, including direct renin inhibition and aldosterone receptor antagonism, in patients who often have hypertension are reviewed. Aliskiren, the first direct renin inhibitor, is effective in a number of these patient groups, including those who are black or obese or who have metabolic syndrome, renal impairment, or diabetes. In addition, in the setting of long-term angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker therapy, aldosterone receptor antagonists (spironolactone and eplerenone) provide another rational therapeutic approach for patients whose blood pressure is not controlled by standard therapies.", 
    "1009": "The pathological role of obesity in the progression of glomerular lesions has rarely been studied in primary glomerular diseases. The purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of non-diabetic obesity on clinicopathological findings in IgA nephropathy.", 
    "1010": "74 patients with biopsy-proven IgA nephropathy were retrospectively divided into two groups according to the criteria for obesity in Japan: non-obese group (group N: n = 50) with BMI <25 kg/m(2), and obese group (group O: n = 24) with BMI > or =25 kg/m(2). Clinical and pathological data at the time of renal biopsy were analyzed. Moreover, the outcome of proteinuria in patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) was evaluated in different groups after a 1-year follow-up.", 
    "1011": "Urinary protein excretion was significantly greater in the obese group compared to normal-weight patients (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the prevalence of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. By light microscopy, the obese group showed significantly larger glomerular size (p < 0.0001). On the other hand, the severity of mesangial matrix expansion and crescent formation revealed no difference between the two groups. By electron microscopy, glomerular basement membrane (GBM) thickness was significantly increased in obese patients (p < 0.001). Among 61 patients who were followed up for 1 year in our institute, 15 patients were treated with ACE-I or ARB without steroids. ACE-I or ARB treatment without steroids tended to reduce proteinuria in the obese patients, but this change did not achieve statistical significance.", 
    "1012": "In IgA nephropathy, obesity induces not only glomerular enlargement but also ultrastructural modification of GBM, which would contribute to increase proteinuria.", 
    "1013": "Cerebral white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are believed to be the consequence of small vessel disease, and it is uncertain whether their extent predicts the risk of dementia in patients with vascular disease history. Method- Brain MRI was performed in 226 participants of the PROGRESS study. WMH severity was assessed using a visual rating scale. During follow-up, patients were classified for incident severe cognitive deterioration (including dementia) using standard criteria.", 
    "1014": "Over 4-year follow-up, the incidence of severe cognitive deterioration ranged from 1.1 to 9.1 per 100 person-years in patients with respectively no or severe WMHs at baseline. In multivariable analysis, incident severe cognitive deterioration was associated with baseline severe WMHs (odds ratio=7.7, P<0.005).", 
    "1015": "Higher WMH load is a strong predictor of dementia and cognitive decline in patients with cerebrovascular disease history.", 
    "1016": "Proteins in bovine milk are a common source of bioactive peptides. The peptides are released by the digestion of caseins and whey proteins. Peptides derived from the different genetic variants A, B, C, E, F1, F2, G1, G2, H, I, and J of bovine kappa-casein (CSN3) were investigated for their inhibitory activities against angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE). Amino acid sequences of the CSN3 variants were analyzed in silico to detect potential ACE inhibitory peptides. Besides known biologically active peptides, exclusive peptides were identified in some CSN3 variants and their biological activity was determined: within CSN3*B and CSN3*C, the ACE inhibitory peptide ASP (IC50 = 242.3; the IC50 value is equivalent to the micromolar concentration of peptide mediating a 50% inhibition of ACE activity) and within CSN3*C the peptide AHHP (IC50 = 847.6) was detected. Furthermore, the peptides VSP (IC50 = 21.8) and ACHP (IC50 = 360.7) were identified in CSN3*F1 and CSN3*G2, respectively.", 
    "1017": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2 activity and angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)] levels are increased in experimental cirrhosis; however, the pathways of hepatic Ang-(1-7) production have not been studied. This study investigated the role of ACE2, ACE, and neutral endopeptidase (NEP) in the hepatic formation of Ang-(1-7) from angiotensin I (Ang I) and Ang II and their effects on portal resistance. Ang I or Ang II were administered to rat bile duct ligated (BDL) and control livers alone and in combination with the ACE inhibitor lisinopril, the ACE and NEP inhibitor omapatrilat, or the ACE2 inhibitor MLN4760 (n = 5 per group). BDL markedly upregulated ACE, ACE2, and NEP. Ang-(1-7) was produced from Ang II in healthy and in BDL livers and was increased following ACE inhibition and decreased by ACE2 inhibition. In contrast, Ang-(1-7) production from Ang I was minimal and not affected by ACE or NEP inhibition. Surprisingly, ACE2 inhibition in BDLs dramatically increased Ang-(1-7) production from Ang I, an effect abolished by ACE2/NEP inhibition. Ang II and Ang I induced greater portal pressure increases in BDL livers than controls. The effects of Ang I were closely correlated with Ang II production and were strongly attenuated by both ACE and ACE/NEP inhibition. These findings show that the major substrate for hepatic production of Ang-(1-7) is Ang II and this is catalyzed by ACE2. Ang I is largely converted to Ang II by ACE, and net conversion of Ang I to Ang-(1-7) is small. NEP has the ability to generate large amounts of Ang-(1-7) in the BDL liver from Ang I only when ACE2 activity is greatly decreased or inhibited."
