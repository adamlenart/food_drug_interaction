    "0": "The extent to which the impaired left ventricle dilates may have important prognostic implications for survival. To determine the influence of infarct size and duration on ventricular dilation, the passive pressure-volume relation of the left ventricle in the rat after coronary artery ligation was obtained. In the early (0.25 to 2 days) phase, the pressure-volume relation was relatively unchanged in all infarct-size groups, except for a rightward shift in the low pressure range for moderate and large infarcts and a leftward shift in the high pressure range for small infarcts. From 2 to 7 days, ventricular dilatation occurred in all groups in relation to infarct size. Thereafter (to 106 days), in rats with moderate and large infarcts, the left ventricle continued to dilate. Associated with this late dilation was a decrease in left ventricular chamber stiffness and an increase in the volume to mass ratio. To determine whether the potentially deleterious progression of ventricular dilation could be attenuated, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril was given 2 or 21 days after infarction and continued for 3 months. There was a significant overall effect of this treatment in attenuating left ventricular dilation, which was most pronounced in moderate infarcts. Captopril not only attenuated the rightward shift of the pressure-volume relation, but also markedly lowered left ventricular filling pressures so that operating volumes in treated rats were considerably reduced compared with those in untreated rats, even in large infarcts. Therapy with captopril also had an overall effect in prolonging survival, the most benefit being observed in moderate infarcts with lesser dilated left ventricles.", 
    "1": "The dilation and distortion of the left ventricle that may occur as a consequence of myocardial infarction are associated with a heightened risk for adverse cardiovascular events. Infarcts that are extensive, transmural, and involve the apex as well as persistently occluded, infarct-related coronary arteries are predisposing factors for ventricular enlargement. Infarct expansion is an early component of the overall process of volume enlargement, which later continues as a volume overload hypertrophy of the remaining myocardium. Therapy to limit myocardial necrosis has been associated with the preservation of a more normal ventricular architecture. The late phase of ventricular remodeling has also been shown to be amendable to therapy, as chronic administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors has been associated with a reduction in the extent of ventricular dilation. There is currently a great deal of clinical investigative interest not only in whether ACE inhibition therapy following acute myocardial infarction will result in preservation of ventricular volume and topography, but, more importantly, whether it will lead to an improvement in clinical outcome.", 
    "2": "The fundamental aim of the International Studies of Infarct Survival (ISIS) collaborative group is to assess reliably the balance of any benefits and risks for widely practicable treatments that might produce moderate but worthwhile mortality reductions in patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction. Substantial numbers of lives might be saved by such treatments, but benefits of the size that can realistically be expected may be reliably detected only by randomized trials involving some tens of thousands of patients. In order to recruit such numbers, ISIS involves almost no extra work for collaborators: hence, busy general hospitals--where the majority of acute myocardial infarction patients are actually treated--can take part easily. The ability of the ISIS trials to yield clear, reliable answers depends entirely on the collaboration of many doctors and nurses in the participating hospitals. For this reason, publication of the final results is in the names of all the collaborators. All patients, high risk as well as low risk, presenting within 24 hours of the onset of suspected acute myocardial infarction are eligible for ISIS-4, provided that the responsible physician does not initially consider there to be any clear indications for, or clear contraindications to, any one of the trial treatments--nitrate, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, or magnesium. Patients are randomized between 1 month of oral controlled-release mononitrate or placebo; between 1 month of oral captopril or placebo; and between 24 hours of intravenous magnesium or open control (i.e., no infusion). (Patients who are to be given intravenous or other non-trial nitrate for just a few days can still be entered). In this trial, 3 quite different treatments will each be evaluated. At first glance, this may appear to complicate the results, but in fact appropriate statistical analysis of this \"factorial\" design will allow all patients to contribute fully to assessment of the separate effects of each treatment (while also providing important information about the combined effects). Apart from giving the trial treatments, all other aspects of individual patient management are left entirely to the responsible physician to decide. For example, previous trials in suspected acute myocardial infarction have shown that, for many categories of patients, antiplatelet and fibrinolytic therapy can save lives. Hence, most collaborating doctors will wish to give antiplatelet therapy routinely and to start fibrinolytic therapy in many of their patients before randomizing them in ISIS-4.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "3": "After large myocardial infarction, compromised left ventricular (LV) function and changes in the peripheral circulation result in the syndrome of chronic congestive heart failure. Although treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors improve cardiovascular function, it is difficult to determine whether this benefit is due to changes in organ versus muscle function. The rat model of heart failure, created by ligating the left coronary artery, results in pathophysiology that is similar to that seen in patients, i.e., increased LV end-diastolic pressure and volume, hypertrophy of the noninfarcted myocardium, prolongation of the time constant of LV relaxation, decreased venous compliance, and increased total blood volume. In noninfarcted papillary muscles, isolated from rats with heart failure, maximal developed tension and peak rate of tension rise (+dT/dt) are decreased, time to peak tension is prolonged, and myocardial stiffness is increased. Morphologic changes include an increase in papillary muscle myocyte cross-sectional area and an increase in myocardial hydroxyproline content. Captopril (2 g/liter drinking water) alters LV loading by decreasing arterial pressure, increasing venous compliance, and decreasing blood volume. This results in a decrease in LV end-diastolic pressure and volume. In the noninfarcted myocardium, time to peak tension is shortened, whereas developed tension, +dT/dt, and muscle stiffness remain abnormal. Captopril decreases myocyte cross-sectional area, but collagen content remains elevated. Thus, in the rat infarct model of heart failure, treatment with captopril alters LV remodeling and hypertrophy but produces only modest improvement in muscle function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "4": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition slowed the progression of congestive heart failure (CHF) in 170 patients who were randomly assigned to either captopril or placebo in the Munich Mild Heart Failure Trial. The two major end points were progression from New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classes I, II, or III to class IV, despite optimal, adjusted standard therapy, and death due to CHF. The relative risk for progressive CHF with captopril therapy was 0.34 (95% confidence interval = 0.17-0.68; p = 0.01). A total of 52 prerandomization variables were tested to determine their contribution to disease progression. Logistic regression analysis revealed 5 independent risk factors for progressive CHF: NYHA class, left ventricular end-systolic diameter, need for diuretic, age, and cardiothoracic ratio. The presence of greater than 2 of these risk factors increased the odds ratio for progression to 8.13 (p less than 0.001) compared with the presence of 0-2 risk factors. However, the effectiveness of captopril in preventing progression was higher within the subgroup of patients who had less severe CHF: the odds ratio was 0.12 (95% confidence interval = 0.03-0.45; p less than 0.01) for patients in NYHA class I or II on captopril and was 0.83 for those in class III. We conclude that the severity of CHF, as represented by the above-defined risk factors, is directly related to the likelihood for the development of progressive heart failure. However, the less severe the heart failure, the more effective the treatment with captopril will be in preventing disease progression. Thus, ACE inhibition has considerable potential for improving the prognosis of patients with mild heart failure.", 
    "5": "The adjunctive use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors with thrombolytic therapy early during acute myocardial infarction offers theoretic advantages. In the acute phase, captopril may scavenge free radicals, blunt the catecholamine response, elicit coronary vasodilation, and increase prostacyclin and bradykinin levels. In the chronic phase, ventricular remodeling may be attenuated. At present, a large number of controlled clinical trials mainly focusing on the effects of ACE inhibition in the chronic phase are underway. Only a few studies concentrate on the effect of acute intervention with ACE inhibitors in ischemia-reperfusion, i.e., thrombolysis in myocardial infarction. In April 1990 under auspices of the Interuniversity Cardiology Institute of the Netherlands, a large nationwide acute intervention trial with captopril in 280 patients receiving thrombolytic therapy was started, the Captopril and Thrombolysis Study (CATS). The primary hypothesis of CATS supposes a very early effect of ACE inhibition on evolving myocardial damage due to ischemia and the consequences of early reperfusion. This will be evaluated by serial echocardiography, Holter monitoring and neurohumoral measurements immediately on thrombolysis and during the first year after myocardial infarction.", 
    "6": "The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is based on their capacity to limit ventricular enlargement and dysfunction. To date, the safety profile of administration of ACE inhibitors early in the course of AMI has not been established. In-hospital and long-term consequences of treatment with the ACE inhibitor zofenopril initiated within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms were compared with those of standard treatment in an open-label trial involving 204 patients with AMI who were not undergoing thrombolytic treatment. Zofenopril promptly blocked ACE activation. Blockade was almost complete (91 +/- 6%) after 72 hours and paralleled decreases in systolic blood pressure. Systemic blood pressure was acutely reduced by zofenopril, and severe but reversible hypotension occurred in 15% of hospitalized patients and in 3% of those treated over the long term. No adverse clinical or biochemical events were reported during the course of zofenopril therapy. Overall cardiovascular mortality was not significantly reduced by early zofenopril compared with placebo therapy (7.8% vs 10.7% [difference not significant]). The inhospital incidence of acute left ventricular failure and ventricular arrhythmias decreased by 63% and 39%, respectively, among zofenopril-treated patients, who also reported fewer anginal episodes both acutely (68% reduction) and over the long term (56% reduction) and did not require as much drug treatment (i.e., diuretics, digoxin, and/or anti-ischemic agents) during the follow-up phase. Left ventricular size decreased and ejection fraction (EF) increased in patients who received zofenopril, and the improvement was greater among patients with poorer ventricular function (EF less than 40%). Early administration of ACE inhibitors may therefore constitute a safe form of therapy for patients with AMI, particularly when the event is complicated by clinical signs or evidence of ventricular dysfunction.", 
    "7": "Sixteen patients (mean age 68 years) with mild to moderate hypertension were treated with either diltiazem or hydrochlorothiazide for 6 weeks, followed by enalapril for a further 6 weeks. A second group of 40 patients (mean age 71 years) was treated with either hydrochlorothiazide or enalapril for 12 weeks; nonresponders received both drugs for 8 weeks. Treatment with hydrochlorothiazide or enalapril resulted in a lowering of systolic and diastolic blood pressures, but diastolic pressure was lower in patients treated with enalapril (89 +/- 2 and 82 +/- 2 mm Hg, respectively; p less than 0.05). Treatment with diltiazem resulted in a decrease in diastolic pressure only. Treatment with hydrochlorothiazide resulted in a 17% decrease in serum potassium (p less than 0.05), which returned to normal when enalapril was substituted. Hydrochlorothiazide also produced a 23% decrease in mononuclear cell sodium content at 4 weeks (p less than 0.01), with a further 15% decrease at 12 weeks (p less than 0.05). Mononuclear cell potassium and magnesium also decreased at 12 weeks by 18 and 16%, respectively (p less than 0.05). All these effects were reversed when enalapril was substituted. A similar pattern of events was seen with diltiazem, which was again reversed with enalapril. Finally, there was no relation between changes in mononuclear cell sodium or other cation content and changes in blood pressure.", 
    "8": "Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in the elderly. Symptoms and signs of CHF in the elderly often differ from those in younger patients. Careful attention to these subtle differences helps in detection of concomitant illnesses that mimic or mask heart failure. The therapeutic approach to CHF in elderly patients is similar to that in younger patients. However, in the elderly, increased attention should be paid to the side effects and interactions of the drugs commonly prescribed. Diastolic dysfunction is a recently recognized factor in the pathogenesis of CHF. Because diastolic dysfunction is treated differently than systolic dysfunction, evaluation of CHF should include a search for both entities.", 
    "9": "The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system appears to play an important initiating role in the pathogenesis of hypertension in patients with autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Therefore, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors would appear to be appropriate therapy for hypertension in such patients. However, because ADPKD is a bilateral disorder, ACE-inhibitor therapy may worsen renal function, as occurs in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis. We describe eight episodes of reversible acute renal deterioration in five patients with ADPKD, massive renal involvement, and chronic renal insufficiency. In all cases, ACE-inhibitor therapy either predisposed the patient to or precipitated the acute event. Two of the patients who had acute renal failure while receiving ACE-inhibitor therapy experienced a recurrence when rechallenged with such therapy. Furthermore, patients receiving combined therapy with an ACE inhibitor and a diuretic and patients who experience a cyst hemorrhage while receiving ACE inhibitor therapy are also at risk for reversible renal dysfunction. Caution is therefore recommended in using ACE inhibitors to treat hypertension in patients with ADPKD who are at high risk because of compromised renal function and massive cystic involvement.", 
    "10": "The effects of mental, static and dynamic stresses on physiologic parameters before and after beta-blocker (n = 24) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (n = 29) treatment were examined. Mental stress induced similar elevation in systolic and diastolic blood pressures (BPs) with and without beta-blocker treatment. During angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor treatment, the change in systolic BP was significantly greater (p less than 0.05). Heart rate response was attenuated by beta blockers and unchanged by the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Skin temperature and galvanic skin resistance significantly decreased (p less than 0.05) with mental stress. Beta blockers did not change the response pattern, whereas the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor attenuated the stress-induced reduction of both skin temperature and galvanic skin response. After handgrip exercise, increases in systolic and diastolic BPs and heart rate were similar before and after beta-blocker treatment, whereas the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor induced small but significantly fewer (p less than 0.05) changes in diastolic BP and heart rate. Treadmill exercise induced similar changes in systolic and diastolic BPs with both treatments compared with no treatment. The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor appears to provide additional protection to that seen with beta blockers during mental and static stressors by blunted changes in skin temperature and galvanic skin resistance.", 
    "11": "Two cases of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor fetopathy with renal tubular dysgenesis and severely underdeveloped calvarial bone are described. Six additional, unexposed cases of hypocalvaria are described, and possible links between calvarial development and fetal hypotension and/or chronic hypoxia are explored.", 
    "12": "Proper classification of patients into diffuse cutaneous and limited cutaneous subsets and the anticipation of complications are the keys to the management of subjects with systemic sclerosis (scleroderma). Patients with early diffuse disease and rapidly progressive skin thickening are at highest risk of developing serious disease of the internal organs (intestine, lung, heart, kidney) and should be considered for disease modifying treatment. The targets of the disease and sites of possible intervention are vascular endothelium (vasoprotective agents), mononuclear cell subsets (immunosuppressive agents), and fibroblasts (colchicine, D-penicillamine). A number of new agents with sound scientific rationale are currently undergoing therapeutic trials. Much can be done to improve the lifestyle of those with scleroderma. The most dramatic recent development is the ability to reverse kidney disease by the prompt use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and modern methods of renal dialysis and transplantation. Scleroderma is not a hopeless disease.", 
    "13": "The cytotoxicity of enalapril maleate (EN) in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes, at concentrations of 0.5 mM or greater, was measured by the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) into the culture medium. Pretreatment of the hepatocytes with L-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine (BSO) and diethyl maleate (DEM) potentiated the toxicity whereas N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) provided protection. EN produced a dose-dependent reduction in intracellular glutathione (GSH) concentration. This was an early effect, apparent after only 1 h of exposure to the drug, whereas loss of cell viability occurred after 6-18 h. These results suggest that the mechanism of EN cytotoxicity involves a GSH-dependent detoxification pathway.", 
    "14": "Dehydration can be brought about by either water deprivation or by heat exposure (thermal dehydration). Angiotensin II has been shown to have a role in water deprivation-induced thirst. The current study was designed to determine whether angiotensin II is involved in thirst caused by thermal dehydration. Male Sprague-Dawley strain rats were dehydrated by exposure to a 40 degree C environment for 2-4 h or by water deprivation for 44 h. Water deprivation but not heat exposure significantly increased plasma renin activity. Neither ureteric ligation nor nephrectomy significantly altered water intake after thermal dehydration. Captopril, an inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme, given at a dose of 100 mg/kg ip, significantly decreased water intake in water-deprived rats but not in thermally dehydrated rats. Angiotensin II therefore does not appear to play a role in the control of water intake of thermally dehydrated rats. The physiological responses to dehydration in rats are dependent on the way in which the dehydration is brought about.", 
    "15": "To examine regional cytochrome oxidation in the outer medulla, we developed fiber optic probes that allowed us to obtain localized reflectance measurements from the outer and inner stripes of the outer medulla. We measured directional changes in cytochrome oxidation in these two regions. In the outer stripe furosemide surprisingly caused a significant decrease in cytochrome oxidation. The decrease occurred concomitantly with a fall in outer medullary blood flow as measured by laser-Doppler flowmetry. Saralasin, an antagonist of angiotensin II caused a significant increase in cytochrome oxidation in the outer stripe. In the inner stripe furosemide tended to increase cytochrome oxidation, and saralasin had no effect. These results indicate that the two regions of the outer medulla may be affected differently by the same agent. They suggest that cytochrome oxidation in the outer stripe is predominantly influenced by outer medullary blood flow, whereas the inner stripe is predominantly influenced by the rate of oxygen consumption. The advantages and limitations of this methodology are discussed.", 
    "16": "Chloride-depletion alkalosis (CDA) has been characterized by hypereninemia. To determine whether angiotensin II (ANG II) has an important role in its maintenance or correction, anesthetized alkalotic rats, chloride depleted by peritoneal dialysis, were infused with 5% dextrose and saralasin (1 microgram.kg-1.min-1) (SAR) or vehicle (SAR-C), 5% dextrose and pretreatment with enalapril (1-1.5 mg/kg) (ENP) or vehicle (ENP-C), or 80 mM Cl solution with ANG II (20 micrograms/min) (ANG) or vehicle (ANG-C). Rats infused with 5% dextrose showed no differences in the magnitude of the alkalosis, inulin clearance, or urinary total CO2 excretion; both SAR and ENP were associated with decreased blood pressure. In SAR, tCO2 delivery out of late proximal convoluted tubule did not differ from that in SAR-C. Rats infused with 80 mM Cl corrected CDA similarly (delta plasma [Cl] - ANG-C + 6 +/- 1, ANG + 5 +/- 1 mM; P = not significant). These data suggest that, although ANG II can importantly influence vascular tone and early proximal tubule bicarbonate reabsorption, it does not have an important role in the renal maintenance or correction of acute CDA.", 
    "17": "In humans, blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitors (ANG CEI) prevents the rise in blood pressure associated with the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO). This study was conducted to determine whether rhEPO elevates blood pressure in normal Wistar rats and whether the renin-ANG system is affected. Groups of 10 rats each were given rhEPO, ANG CEI (enalapril), rhEPO + ANG CEI, or vehicle. Renin and/or renin substrate mRNA was measured in aortas, kidney, and heart; renin activity (PRA), inactive renin, and renin substrate were measured in plasma. rhEPO raised blood pressure in the normal rat without changing the plasma renin system. ANG CEI prevented this blood pressure rise. Renin-specific mRNA was increased by rhEPO in renal tissue, and renin substrate mRNA was significantly elevated in the kidney and aorta. mRNA for renin and renin substrate were not altered in the heart. In both aorta and kidney, a significant correlation was observed between renin substrate mRNA and blood pressure. The data indicate that rhEPO modulates specific tissue renin-ANG systems, which may contribute to blood pressure elevation.", 
    "18": "In a placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover, double-blind study of 17 normal volunteers, we examined the effects of captopril on the concentration of opioid peptides during bicycle exercise and on quality of life after a 2-week treatment period. Two exercise tests (progressive exercise and constant work rate exercise) were performed. Maximum oxygen uptake and blood lactate concentrations were measured in progressive exercise tests. The exercise intensities corresponding to a 1/2 lactate threshold, a lactate threshold, and a 4 mmol/L lactate concentration were determined. Constant work rate exercise at selected work loads for 20 minutes was carried out to measure the concentrations of opioid peptides and other hormones. Quality of life was assessed after the 2-week treatment period. Captopril treatment had no effect on the exercise response of blood pressure, heart rate, maximum VO2, and maximum work loads. The plasma concentrations of lactate, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and aldosterone increased during exercise and captopril did not change them. Beta-endorphin levels and plasma renin activity also increased during exercise, and the increases were greater with captopril treatment. Met-enkephalin and leu-enkephalin concentrations did not increase during exercise. According to responses in the quality of life questionnaires, administration of captopril improved the physiologic state more than the placebo did. These findings suggest that captopril may act on the central nervous system involving an increase in the beta-endorphin level.", 
    "19": "A review of two cases of angioedema associated with therapeutic doses of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril are presented along with a review of the relevant literature. Although angioedema of the facial and oral pharyngeal regions is a relatively rare occurrence with the use of ACE inhibitors, recognition of these agents as the cause of such a condition, when subacute, can lead to a rapid cure. Knowledge of these effects may also be helpful in the management of an acute clinical manifestation and, as importantly, may help prevent a recurrent episode due to the ill-guided continuation of the drug.", 
    "20": "The renin-angiotensin system originally was thought to be responsible for only renovascular hypertension, but the development and use of various inhibitors of this system have produced much evidence for its participation in many forms of hypertensive disease. Tissue renin-angiotensin system also may play a major role in blood pressure control. Chronic clinical as well as animal use of converting enzyme inhibitors results in levels of angiotensin II that are equivalent to those found in the normotensive state and higher than those found in the very acute phase of treatment. The source of this conversion possibly may be due to enzymes unrelated to angiotensin converting enzyme. One such enzyme is a very highly specific serine protease isolated from human cardiac tissue. This enzyme exists in human ventricular tissue at levels four to five times that of angiotensin converting enzyme. During chronic treatment of patients with heart failure, angiotensin I levels become high, and heart tissue levels of angiotensin II may become elevated because of the conversion to angiotensin II by this serine protease. This conversion in turn may possibly increase inotropy of the heart, whereas the peripheral resistance remains low because of the reduction of angiotensin II in the circulation.", 
    "21": "Few data exist regarding the effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with regurgitant valvular lesions. We postulated an immediate improvement in cardiac performance with captopril in mitral regurgitation, which, in a hemodynamically compensated group of patients, might be mediated through parasympathetic vasodilation rather than through blockade of angiotension converting enzyme.", 
    "22": "Hemodynamics were examined before and 90 minutes after oral captopril (25-50 mg) in 18 patients (mean age, 31 years) with chronic, severe mitral regurgitation in New York Heart Association functional class II and III. One group of patients was given captopril alone (group 1, n = 9) and a second group was given captopril plus atropine 0.04 mg/kg i.v. (group 2, n = 9). Captopril alone (group 1) produced decreases in heart rate (90-81 beats/min, p less than 0.001), mean arterial pressure (90-73 mm Hg, p less than 0.001), systemic resistance (28-23 Wood units, p = 0.068), and pulmonary wedge pressure (19-14 mm Hg, p less than 0.001). There was no improvement in either arteriovenous oxygen difference or thermodilution cardiac output; in fact, the latter slightly declined (3.45-3.35 l/min, p = 0.002). Pretreatment with atropine (group 2) diminished the effects of captopril on heart rate (107-103 beats/min, p = 0.065 for atropine effect by two-way ANOVA), mean arterial pressure (88-82 mm Hg, p = 0.01 for atropine effect), and systemic resistance (26-27 Wood units, p = 0.04 for atropine effect).", 
    "23": "In patients with chronic, severe mitral regurgitation, captopril reduced systemic arterial and left ventricular filling pressures but did not immediately augment cardiac output as expected. Furthermore, the modest systemic vasodilator effect of captopril was parasympathetically mediated.", 
    "24": "We report a case of myocardial necrosis in a newborn after treatment of the mother with long-term subcutaneous terbutaline. No such serious side effects in the fetus have previously been reported. We speculate that this myocardial damage was due to beta-sympathomimetic therapy.", 
    "25": "In the present study, the efficacy of cilazapril (Ro 31-2848/006, CAS 88768-40-5), a new angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, was examined in 7 essential hypertensive patients by monitoring ambulatory blood pressure for 24 h. Oral cilazapril, given once a day in the morning, lowered systolic and diastolic blood pressure without affecting heart rate. Daily profiles of blood pressure and heart rate, however, were not different from those prior to cilazapril in these patients. Percentages of high blood pressure values (more than 160/95 mmHg), both systolic and diastolic decreased, following cilazapril administration. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring revealed that cilazapril did not cause a dangerous fall in blood pressure even in the night time. From these results, cilazapril could be an effective and useful antihypertensive drug for the treatment of essential hypertensive patients.", 
    "26": "We assessed the efficacy and safety of cilazapril, alone or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide. It was an open trial, that included 14 patients with or more 114 mmHg of diastolic arterial tension. On the first stage of 25 days, the arterial tension was normalized in 5 patients with 10 mg of cilazapril and 7 patients when hydrochlorothiazide was added, 2 patients did not respond. On the second stage of 52 weeks, of the 12 patients whose diastolic arterial tension was normalized, 2 patients remained with normal arterial tension with cilazapril, 5 when hydrochlorothiazide was added and the rest 5 patients did not respond. No undesirable side effects were detected, nor abnormalities in the laboratory tests. The long-term benefit obtained on 50% of patients make evident the usefulness of cilazapril in severe arterial hypertension. Its administration once a day and the absence of side effects increase the interest of its use.", 
    "27": "The antihypertensive efficacy of 2.5 and 5 mg cilazapril and placebo in lowering 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) and BP load were compared in 42 patients with mild to moderate hypertension. After a 2-week placebo run-in period, patients were randomized double-blind to receive either 2.5 mg cilazapril (n = 14), 5 mg cilazapril (n = 14), or placebo (n = 14) for 4 weeks. There were no significant differences in 24-h and awake ABP or in office BP between 2.5 and 5 mg cilazapril. Moreover, the percentage of patients that had BP control (mean daytime ABP less than 90 mm Hg) was 14% in the placebo group, 64% and 71% with 2.5 and 5 mg cilazapril, respectively. Furthermore, the percentage of BP load was similar with both regimens (29 v 36%). These observations indicate that 2.5 and 5 mg cilazapril have equipotent antihypertensive efficacy.", 
    "28": "Although the role of angiotensin II (Ang II) in the pathogenesis and progression of the failing heart is uncertain, previous reports have suggested that myocyte injury may be a component in this process. In this study, we investigated this possibility in more detail. Cardiotoxic effects of nonacutely hypertensive doses of Ang II were examined in 90 rats, including those receiving an angiotensin infusion (200 ng/min i.p.) and those with renovascular hypertension, where endogenous stimulation of Ang II occurred. Myocyte injury and wound healing resulting from these treatments were evaluated by 1) immunofluorescence after in vivo monoclonal antibody labeling of myosin to detect abnormal sarcolemmal permeability, 2) [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA, to detect fibroblast proliferation, and 3) light microscopic evidence of myocytolysis and subsequent scar formation. We found that exogenous Ang II produced multifocal antimyosin labeling of cardiac myocytes and myocytolysis, which were maximal on days 1-2 of the infusion. Subsequently, DNA synthesis rates were increased, with fibroblast proliferation reaching peak levels on day 2 (Ang II-treated rats, 90.0 +/- 18.6 cpm/micrograms DNA; control rats, 11.4 +/- 2.3 cpm/micrograms DNA; p less than 0.05); microscopic scarring was found on day 14 and represented 0.12 +/- 0.02% of the myocardium. Concurrent treatment with both propranolol (30 mg/kg/day s.c.) and phenoxybenzamine (5 mg/kg/day i.m.) did not attenuate Ang II-induced antimyosin labeling. Increased endogenous Ang II, resulting from renal ischemia after abdominal aortic constriction, produced both antimyosin labeling and increased rates of DNA synthesis like that observed with Ang II infusion. Both myocyte injury and fibroplasia were prevented with captopril (65 mg/day p.o.), but this protective effect was not seen with reserpine pretreatment. Infrarenal aortic banding without renal ischemia, on the other hand, produced hypertension without necrosis. We conclude that pathophysiological levels of endogenous as well as low-dose exogenous Ang II were associated with altered sarcolemmal permeability and myocytolysis with subsequent fibroblast proliferation and scar formation. Myocyte injury was unrelated to the hypertensive or enhanced adrenergic effects of Ang II or to hypertension per se. Captopril was effective in preventing myocyte injury in renovascular hypertension. The mechanism(s) responsible for Ang II-induced necrosis will require further study.", 
    "29": "The aim was to compare the effects of two novel angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, spirapril and zofenopril, on cardiac remodelling in rats with congestive heart failure after myocardial infarction. Spirapril contains no sulphydryl group, whereas zofenopril is a sulphydryl containing ACE inhibitor.", 
    "30": "Experimental myocardial infarction was induced by ligation of the left coronary artery. Sham operated animals served as controls. Treatment with spirapril (2-2.5 mg.kg-1.d-1) or zofenopril (12-15 mg.kg-1.d-1) added to the drinking water was started immediately after myocardial infarction or sham operation and continued for six weeks. After the treatment period, all rats were killed. The heart was rapidly removed and perfused as described by Langendorff. Heart rate and left ventricular pressure were measured both at baseline and during stimulation with isoprenaline (6 nM). Heart and lung weights were determined.", 
    "31": "Normotensive male Wistar rats (220-240 g) were used.", 
    "32": "Experimental myocardial infarction considerably increased left ventricular cavity volume. Chronic treatment with either spirapril or zofenopril significantly attenuated this increase in volume. In infarcted rats, the increase in total heart and lung weight was also significantly reduced by chronic treatment with spirapril and zofenopril, indicating that these compounds reduce cardiac mass and pulmonary congestion in congestive heart failure due to myocardial infarction. There were no significant differences between treatment with spirapril and zofenopril. In the isolated and perfused rat heart, myocardial infarction significantly decreased both heart rate and left ventricular pressure. Converting enzyme inhibition only affected heart rate. Heart rate was significantly higher in infarcted animals treated with spirapril and zofenopril than in untreated infarcted animals.", 
    "33": "Both spirapril and zofenopril attenuated ventricular enlargement and cardiac hypertrophy in rats with congestive heart failure after myocardial infarction when treatment was started in the acute phase of myocardial infarction. No additional role could be attributed to the sulphydryl moiety of zofenopril. It is also suggested that these two ACE inhibitors modify cardiac sympathetic activity in rats with congestive heart failure, but more studies are needed to confirm these findings.", 
    "34": "Captopril, as well as amitriptyline, was shown to enhance apomorphine-induced stereotype in mice. At doses, which failed to modify the effect of apomorphine, both substances reversed the inhibitory action of sulpiride and haloperidol on stereotypical behaviour. Treatment with captopril (25 mg/kg) did not modify the open-field behaviour, but significantly reduced the immobility in the forced swim test (20 mg/kg) Dopaminergic link was suggested to be involved in the CNS effect of captopril.", 
    "35": "Effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and calcium channel blockers (CaB) on renal blood flow (RBF), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and autoregulation (AR) of RBF were studied on the uninephrectomized spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) under the conditions of high (H) and low (L) salt loading. SHR was given with 0.9% or 0.09% NaCl solution as drinking water (GH, GL). Each group was divided into three groups for treatment with enalapril (Enp) and nitredipine (Nit); i.e. Enp group (GHE, GLE), Nit group (GHN, GLN) and control group (GHC, GLC). After 6 weeks, inulin clearance (Cin) was determined and RBF was measured by means of an electromagnetic flow meter. The renal arterial pressure was lowered by clamping and changes in RBF and AR were examined. Cin showed higher values of 1.85 and 1.69 ml/min in GHN and GLN, as compared to be 1.33 and 1.28 ml/min in GHC and GLC (p less than 0.01). Filtration fraction (FF) showed lower values of 0.18 and 0.20 ml/min in GHE and GLE (p less than 0.01), whereas 0.29 and 0.30 in GHC and GLC respectively. RBF was markedly lower at 7.4 ml/min in GLC as compared to 9.9 ml/min in GHC (p less than 0.01). In GH, GHE showed a higher value of 11.6 ml/min, as compared to GHC (p less than 0.01). In GL, comparing with GLC the value was much higher of 12.1 ml/min in GLE (p less than 0.01). AR of RBF diminished in GLC at higher blood pressure as compared to GHC (p less than 0.01). It was maintained at lower blood pressure in GLE (p less than 0.01), but there were no significant differences between four groups; i.e. GLN, GHC, GHE and GHN. In summary, low salt loading reduced RBF and suppressed AR. Enp elevated RBF, lowered FF and caused AR to be maintained even at lower blood pressure. Nit elevated RBF and GFR without changing FF, and did not suppress AR. These results indicate that, in hypertension complicated with moderate dysfunction, both ACEI and CAB are expected to exhibit the beneficial effects on maintenance of renal circulation, despite though the different mechanism.", 
    "36": "It has been reported that elevation of blood pressure produces a reduction in pain sensitivity. This study was designed to clarify the correlation in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) between fall in blood pressure and pain sensitivity. In seven-weeks-old male SHR, the angiotensin converting inhibitor delapril (10 mg/kg/day) or calcium antagonist nifedipine (3 mg/kg/day) was administered orally every day for 8 weeks. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) pretreatment was significantly higher in the SHR than in normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats and pain sensitivity measured with the hot plate method was significantly lower in the SHR than in the WKY rats. Administration of both drugs produced a significant suppression of elevation of SBP, and produced a significant elevation of pain sensitivity. Furthermore, at 8 weeks after drug administration, urinary norepinephrine (UNE) significantly decreased and plasma beta-endorphin (beta-end) significantly increased. A significant correlation was noted between pain sensitivity and SBP and also between pain sensitivity and UNE. Of these, pain sensitivity was the more closely correlated to degree of change in UNE than to degree of change in SBP. It appears that elevation of pain sensitivity is due to suppression of the sympathetic nervous system by antihypertensive drugs, but not to elevation of beta-end levels. These data suggest that a fall in blood pressure through administration of delapril or nifedipine reverses decrease in pain sensitivity in SHR and that decrease in sympathetic tone plays an important role in the restoration of levels of sensitivity to pain.", 
    "37": "Effects of Captopril. Journal of Molecular and Cellular Cardiology (1991) 23, 1245-1253. This study was undertaken to investigate the alterations in interstitial DNA synthesis and collagen content in the non-infarcted left and right ventricle after induction of a myocardial infarction (MI) in the rat. MI was induced by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery. All animals received 5-Bromo-2'-deoxyUridine (BrdU), via a subcutaneous osmotic minipump, one day before sacrifice, to quantitate DNA synthesis. A transient rise in BrdU incorporation was found in both ventricles. Peak levels were found at day 7 and 14 after infarct induction. BrdU incorporation had returned to control levels 3 weeks after infarct induction. By using anti BRDU--anti-laminin immuno- double staining DNA synthesis was localized mainly in the cardiac interstitium. Concomitantly, a sustained increase in collagen content, measured as the Sirius red positive area on cross sections, was found from day 7 after infarct induction. No changes were found in sham animals. In the second part of the study the effects of the angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor captopril and the arteriolar vasodilator hydralazine on MI induced interstitial DNA synthesis and collagen content were investigated. Captopril reduced both the increase in DNA synthesis and collagen content. Hydralazine did not affect interstitial DNA synthesis, but reduced the MI induced collagen content. Both drugs had no effects in sham animals. We conclude that induction of a myocardial infarction stimulates interstitial DNA synthesis and increases the collagen content in the non-infarcted areas of the heart. Interstitial DNA synthesis is dependent on the angiotensin I converting enzyme in a direct manner independent from afterload changes.", 
    "38": "The available literature on the evaluation of diastolic function, the importance of diastolic dysfunction in congestive heart failure (CHF), and the effects of therapeutic agents on diastolic dysfunction are summarized. The normal cardiac cycle consists of two components: systole (contraction; ventricular emptying) and diastole (dilation; ventricular filling). Recent studies have shown that 30-40% of patients with CHF have normal systolic function; the majority of these patients have diastolic dysfunction as the underlying disorder. As a result, the role of diastolic dysfunction in CHF is currently an area of interest for researchers. The two primary causes of diastolic dysfunction are left ventricular hypertrophy and ischemic heart disease. Patients with CHF caused by diastolic dysfunction and patients with CHF caused by systolic dysfunction have nearly identical clinical presentations. Therapy with diuretics, vasodilators, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, beta-agonists, the partial beta-agonist xamoterol, phosphodiesterase III inhibitors, or calcium-channel blockers may be beneficial in patients with diastolic dysfunction. Therapy with digitalis glycosides would be of no benefit, and could theoretically be detrimental, in patients with predominant diastolic dysfunction. Available data indicate that beta blockers have neither an important beneficial effect nor an important detrimental effect on diastolic function. Continued studies into diastolic dysfunction and the diastolic properties of agents that are used in the treatment of CHF should enhance the understanding of this clinical syndrome and the drugs used to treat it.", 
    "39": "The efficacy and tolerability of a preconstituted formulation combining enalapril (20 mg) and hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg) were evaluated in patients with essential hypertension unresponsive to enalapril monotherapy (20 mg/day). The duration of this open-lable, multicenter, noncomparative trial was 12 weeks: a two-week washout period followed by ten weeks of active treatment. During the active treatment period, patients received enalapril alone (up to 20 mg/day) for six weeks. At the end of week 6, patients with supine diastolic blood pressure greater than 90 mmHg were treated with the enalapril/hydrochlorothiazide combination therapy (EN/HCTZ). Of the 147 patients who were entered into the study, 81 were not normalized with enalapril alone. At the end of the study period, blood pressure was normalized (supine diastolic blood pressure less than or equal to 90 mmHg) in 60 (74%) of the 81 patients who had received the EN/HCTZ combination. Overall, 86% of the patients achieved satisfactory blood pressure control with this therapeutic regimen. Adverse reactions were mild and transient. Six patients experienced undesirable effects, the most frequent of which was coughing (2 cases). Neither enalapril (20 mg/day) alone nor the EN/HCTZ combination had any significant influence on any of the metabolic parameters evaluated. No hypokalemia and no significant changes in serum lipids occurred in the course of the study.", 
    "40": "The MET3 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was cloned and its restriction map was found to differ in the upstream region from an earlier published map (Cherest et al. Gene 34, 269-281, 1985) and nucleotide sequence (Cherest et al. Mol. Gen. Genet. 210, 307-313, 1987). Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA from strains S288C and FL100 (the genetic backgrounds from which these different copies of the gene had been cloned) showed that our clone from a S288C-based library had the same restriction map as the chromosomal DNA from both of the strains. Comparison of the nucleotide sequence of the two clones indicated that the earlier published clone probably represented a cloning artifact. In our clone, we found upstream of MET3, the nucleotide sequence of the TDH2 gene (Holland and Holland, J. Biol. Chem. 255, 2596-2605, 1980). The chromosomal orientation of the two genes was determined to be MET3-TDH2-CEN10.", 
    "41": "The treatment of heart failure has two main objectives: the improvement of the quality of life and the decrease of cardiac mortality. The first has been proved on several open studies and placebo controlled studies, using converting enzyme inhibitors. Mortality of these patients is very high and half is by sudden death. It has been proved, by several important studies, that these drugs can reduce the cardiac mortality probably acting on the arrhythmogenic mechanisms and on the structural deterioration of the heart.", 
    "42": "Quinapril, an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and an antihypertensive agent, was evaluated in rats for effects on fertility, reproduction, and perinatal and postnatal development. In a fertility study, male rats were treated by gavage for 60 days prior to and during mating and female rats were treated by gavage for 14 days prior to mating, during mating and gestation, and during lactation with doses of 0, 10, 50, or 100 mg quinapril/kg body wt. There were no significant effects on body weight, food consumption, fertility indices, fetal development, or neonatal growth, survival, development, behavior, or reproduction. In a perinatal/postnatal study, administration of quinapril to females at doses of 25, 75, or 150 mg/kg during late gestation and lactation had no effects on parturition, lactation, or postnatal development, but a significant decrease in neonatal body weight during the suckling period was observed at all doses. In a subsequent study, female rats were given 150 mg/kg during late gestation, lactation, or late gestation and lactation. No adverse effects were seen in the dams or the offspring, and no reduction in neonatal body weight was observed. Kidneys from pups whose mothers received quinapril during gestation and/or lactation had minimal juxtaglomerular cell hypertrophy, characteristic of treatment with ACE inhibitors. Low levels of quinaprilat (the major and pharmacologically active metabolite of quinapril) were detected in fetal blood and in neonatal blood, indicating offspring exposure to quinapril. Milk quinaprilat concentrations were 3-5% of the plasma concentrations 3-5 hr after dosing. These studies demonstrate no adverse effects of quinapril on fertility, reproduction, or perinatal and postnatal development.", 
    "43": "The evaluation of mild to moderate hypertension must be carried out under the conditions in which treatments are usually prescribed, i.e., in general practice. After specific training of the physicians in the methods used, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of a new formulation of verapamil by comparing it with a reference drug: captopril. The main assessment criterion was the restoration of normal blood pressure in mildly to moderately hypertensive patients (blood pressure in excess of 160/95 mmHg). Blood pressure was evaluated by two methods: a mercury column sphygmomanometer, after the patient had rested in a half-sitting position for 10 minutes, and the ambulatory measurement of blood pressure (AMBP) using the SpaceLabs system. The results of this study involving 40 patients followed up for 3 months by 8 GPs in collaboration with our blood pressure unit were as follows: on verapamil, 47% of patients recovered normal values after 30 days of treatment and 71% after 60 days (with no change in dosage). On captopril, the normalization rates were 22 and 27% respectively. The highly significant reduction of blood pressure found by the \"occasional\" measurement for both treatments (p less than 0.001) was only faintly reflected by AMBP. Verapamil induced a reduction of nighttime blood pressure with no significant impact on heart rate. The clinical, paraclinical and electrocardiographic safety of both treatments was good.", 
    "44": "Many antihypertensive drugs are extensively metabolised in humans. Since some metabolites are active and may therefore contribute to the pharmacological activity of the parent drugs, knowledge of the pharmacokinetic properties of active metabolites is important for understanding the overall effects of drugs. Four categories of antihypertensive drugs with active metabolites are dealt with, with selected examples described in some detail. First, drugs with effects relying totally on active metabolites include agents such as methyldopa, cadralazine and many angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Secondly, those with effects primarily due to active metabolites include drugs such as triamterene and spironolactone. Thirdly, agents with effects primarily due to the parent drug, but with active metabolites providing significant contributions to the overall pharmacological effect, include drugs such as indoramin, alprenolol, acebutolol, diltiazem and verapamil. Lastly, agents with pharmacological effects with only minor (if any) contributions from active metabolites include drugs such as propranolol, metoprolol, carteolol and others.", 
    "45": "Kidney disease is a primary cause of morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients. Factors that predetermine development of nephropathy remain unknown. Poor glycemic control, insulin requirement, duration of diabetes and family history of hypertension appear to be associated with an increased risk. Arterial hypertension, which is twice as common in diabetic patients as in the normal population, accelerates the progression of diabetic nephropathy. The pathophysiologic mechanisms responsible for hypertension appear to be different in IDDM and NIDDM. In IDDM, hypertension occurs usually as a consequence of diabetic renal disease. Conversely, the pathogenesis in NIDDM appears to be multifactorial. In either condition, aggressive blood pressure control is the single most important intervention proven to retard the progression of nephropathy. A stepped-care approach similar to that for essential hypertension with slight modifications is indicated in the treatment of the hypertensive diabetic patient with nephropathy. Nonpharmacological therapy, including dietary protein restriction, should be used as first step. Selection of the ideal antihypertensive must be based not only on efficacy but also on its side effect profile. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium antagonists have a low incidence of side effects and do not induce metabolic disturbances. Therefore, they are the agents of choice for patients who do not respond to nonpharmacological therapy alone. Thiazide diuretics and beta-blockers should be used as first line therapy only for specific indications. Antihypertensive therapy combined with good glycemic control and dietary protein restriction constitute the standard of care for diabetic patients with hypertension and renal disease.", 
    "46": "Nitrates and other nitrosovasodilators are locally acting agents. Their efficacy is reported to depend upon the availability of sulfhydryl groups in vascular smooth muscle. Long term nitrosovasodilator therapy has limited effectiveness, and development of nitrate tolerance has been recognized to be due to exhaustion of the tissue sulfhydryl pool, in addition to vasodilation-induced reflex activation of the neurohumoral system. Under both experimental and clinical conditions it has been demonstrated that N-acetylcysteine and other exogenously introduced sulfhydryl donors potentiate hemodynamic responses to nitrates and reverse nitrate tolerance. The newer group of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor drugs has been reported to be effective in reducing afterload and preload in a variety of experimental and clinical trials. Captopril, the first developed ACE inhibitor, and its analogs contain sulfhydryl groups. Although the sulfhydryl group of captopril is not thought to be responsible for its vasodilator action, it can act as a sulfhydryl donor to promote nitrate effectiveness and prevent development of tolerance. Limited experimental and clinical trials on combined therapy with nitrates and captopril have produced promising results. An ingenious prototype compound, S-nitrosocaptopril, has recently been synthesized. This is an exciting new development in vasodilator therapy, but clinical application must await full experimental characterization of this and other identical compounds.", 
    "47": "Chronic cough is a side effect of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor class of antihypertensives. The cough is thought to be a result of inhibition of the enzymes that break down some of the mediators of inflammation, such as the bradykinins and tachykinins. We report 20 patients with chronic cough caused by ACE inhibitors and some of the characteristics of the cough. The cough is typically dry, nonproductive, and worse at night. Interference with sleep is common and was severe in three patients. Women outnumbered men in this series: urinary stress incontinence developed in five, rectal and vaginal prolapse developed in one. Three patients felt they were incapacitated by the cough. Most had been on multiple medications; only oxycodone was reported to be effective in controlling the cough, and four patients thought they were addicted to that. All coughs resolved with withdrawal of the ACE inhibitor. Chronic cough is common among individuals taking ACE inhibitors. It may be severe and associated with complications. The incidence and potential severity is understated in drug information sources, and patients and physicians often fail to recognize cough as a drug side effect.", 
    "48": "The aim of the study was to selectively examine the effects of converting enzyme inhibition on the large brain arteries by using concomitant inhibition of carbonic anhydrase to cause severe dilatation of mainly parenchymal resistance vessels.", 
    "49": "Cerebral blood flow was measured using the xenon-133 injection technique in three groups of Wistar rats either during carbonic anhydrase inhibition with acetazolamide (treatment A, n = 8), during carbonic anhydrase inhibition followed by converting enzyme inhibition with captopril 40 minutes later (treatment B, n = 10), or during carbonic anhydrase inhibition preceded by converting enzyme inhibition 20 minutes earlier (treatment C, n = 7).", 
    "50": "After treatment A, cerebral blood flow rose rapidly and stabilized within 20 minutes at an average of 220 ml/100 g.min; flow remained stable until at least 60 minutes. After treatment B, cerebral blood flow increased by a further 17.4%, from an average of 219 ml/100 g.min to an average of 257 ml/100 g.min (p less than 0.01). After treatment C, cerebral blood flow stabilized at an average of 238 ml/100 g.min, with flow from 20 to 60 minutes always being higher (from 5% to 17%) than during carbonic anhydrase inhibition alone (p less than 0.02). Thus the additional inhibition of converting enzyme resulted in higher cerebral blood flow than during inhibition of carbonic anhydrase alone.", 
    "51": "These results suggest that converting enzyme inhibition reduced resistance of large brain arteries and support the hypothesis that there is some angiotensin II-induced tone in large cerebral arteries.", 
    "52": "In 1984, the suspicion that pharmacological treatment may worsen the insulin resistance and associated metabolic abnormalities in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism and contribute to the relative failure of antihypertensive treatment to produce more than marginal reductions in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality led us to start a series of trials aimed at elucidating how antihypertensive drugs affect insulin sensitivity. These trials, which included assessment of insulin sensitivity by the euglycemic insulin clamp, showed that beta-adrenergic blockade and thiazide diuretic treatment (hydrochlorothiazide) increase insulin resistance and basal plasma insulin, whereas Ca(2+)-channel antagonists (verapamil and diltiazem), with the exception of the negative effect of nifedipine, are metabolically neutral. alpha-Adrenergic blockade with prazosin and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition with captopril enhance insulin sensitivity. The mechanisms underlying the positive effects of ACE inhibition and beta-adrenergic blockade are largely unknown, but hemodynamic factors (vasodilation) may contribute by improving the access of glucose and insulin to skeletal muscle. The drugs, which were favorable or neutral with respect to insulin sensitivity, caused no changes in lipids or glucose homeostasis. In contrast, beta-blockers, except pindolol, had negative effects on triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and thiazide diuretics caused adverse effects on total serum cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and total and very-low-density lipoprotein triglyceride. The metabolic action of antihypertensive drugs is an important factor to consider in the choice of a proper treatment strategy in both diabetic and nondiabetic patients with hypertension.", 
    "53": "In this article, we analyze the blood pressure (BP) threshold for the start of antihypertensive treatment in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) patients, with particular emphasis on those with persistent microalbuminuria or proteinuria (incipient and overt nephropathy, respectively). In such individuals, there is a clear increase in the prevalence of hypertension and in actual measured BP values that is not observed in normoalbuminuric patients. In 94 young healthy adults (less than 45 yr of age), average mean +/- SD arterial pressure (MAP; diastolic + 1/3 pulse pressure) was approximately 90.0 +/- 8.1 mmHg, closely corresponding to large population studies. In microalbuminuric IDDM patients, MAP values between approximately 105 and approximately 95 mmHg have been found in different studies, and the level has progressively decreased in various studies between 1984 and 1990 with similar BP-measuring techniques. Somewhat higher values are seen in patients with proteinuria, who are also consistently characterized by reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR). A clear correlation is found between MAP plotted against the increased rate of microalbuminuria (%/yr) in incipient nephropathy and against fall rate of GFR (ml.min-1.mo-1) in proteinuric patients. In the natural history of renal disease, different cutoff points in MAP for start of progression are observed: greater than 95 mmHg for the start of progression of microalbuminuria and greater than 105 mmHg for the decrease in GFR. During antihypertensive treatment, there is reduction or no progression in microalbuminuria with MAP of approximately 90-95 mmHg and only a limited fall in GFR with MAP of approximately 100 mmHg. However, certain antihypertensive drugs (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) may have specific renoprotective actions, reducing microalbuminuria at rather low BP levels or even independent of BP reduction. The optimal way of monitoring BP may be by 24-h ambulatory recording.", 
    "54": "Eighteen hypertensive patients with a resting diastolic blood pressure between 100 and 120 mmHg who also had angina and proven coronary arterial disease entered a dose titration study to evaluate the efficacy of captopril as a single therapy in hypertension and coexisting stable angina. Captopril was administered for 2 weeks at 25 or 50 mg three times daily and the patients evaluated subjectively and by maximal symptom limited treadmill exercise testing. In comparison to placebo captopril 25 mg and 50 mg dosage increased time to 1 mm ST depression from 188.2 +/- 24.4 sec on placebo to 337.6 +/- 29.5 and 364.2 +/- 36.2 sec respectively (P less than 0.01). The maximum ST segment depression was reduced from 2.5 +/- 0.25 mm on placebo to 1.4 +/- 0.22 mm on captopril 25 mg and 1.2 +/- 0.30 mm on captopril 50 mg (P less than 0.01). Exercise duration increased from 310.3 +/- 21.4 sec on placebo to 438.3 +/- 27.3 sec on captopril 25 mg and to 460.9 +/- 26.5 sec on captopril 50 mg (P less than 0.01). The resting systolic blood pressure decreased from 184.1 +/- 4.7 mmHg on placebo to 159 +/- 4.2 mmHg on captopril 25 mg and to 150.9 +/- 4.6 mmHg on captopril 50 mg (less than 0.01). Similarly, diastolic blood pressure decreased from 111.6 +/- 2.1 mmHg on placebo to 93.8 +/- 1.3 mmHg on captopril 25 mg and to 90.0 +/- 1.7 mmHg on captopril 50 mg (P less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "55": "In addition to plasma metabolism of substance P (SP) by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE; EC 3.4.15.1) (less than 1.0 nmol/min/ml), the majority of SP hydrolysis by rat and human plasma was due to dipeptidyl(amino)peptidase IV (DAP IV; EC 3.4.14.5) (3.15-5.91 nmol/min/ml), which sequentially converted SP to SP(3-11) and SP(5-11). In turn, the SP(5-11) metabolite was rapidly hydrolyzed by rat and human plasma aminopeptidase M (AmM; EC 3.4.11.2) (24.2-25.5 nmol/min/ml). The Km values of SP for DAP IV and of SP(5-11) for AmM ranged from 32.7 to 123 microM. In contrast, neurokinin A (NKA) was resistant to both ACE and DAP IV but was subject to N-terminal hydrolysis by AmM (3.76-10.8 nmol/min/ml; Km = 90.7 microM). These data demonstrate differential processing of SP and NKA by specific peptidases in rat and human plasma.", 
    "56": "Calcium antagonists are now recommended as monotherapy for the treatment of mild to moderate essential hypertension by the Joint National Committee (JNC) on the Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure. Based on a statement in the 1988 JNC report that black and elderly patients tend to respond better to calcium antagonists, we reviewed the literature to examine the predictive value of age and race to the antihypertensive response of calcium antagonists. The majority of studies we reviewed failed to substantiate the JNC statement and well-promulgated reports in the literature suggesting preferential action of calcium antagonists in the elderly, or their superiority when compared with diuretics, beta-adrenergic blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Although not noted by the JNC, pretreatment blood pressure appeared to be an important predictor of the antihypertensive response to calcium antagonists. The literature reviewed indicates that calcium antagonists have comparable efficacy in black and white hypertensive patients. However, the limited comparative studies reviewed support the JNC statement that, as with diuretics, blacks have a greater antihypertensive response with calcium antagonists than with beta-adrenergic blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "57": "Thirty-four patients with essential hypertension at WHO stage I or II were divided into three groups. Group I consisted of 22 cases who displayed normal renin activity (NR) or low renin activity (LR) and who received a single administration of captopril. Group II consisted of 6 cases given beta-blockers after administration of captopril. Group III consisted of 6 cases in whom beta-blocker was replaced with thiazide diuretics after administration of captopril alone. Blood pressure decreased significantly by captopril treatment alone in group I of the NR and LR subgroups (except for the diastolic blood pressure [DBP] of the NR subgroup) and fell below the target blood pressure (SBP of 165 mmHg and DBP of 95 mmHg) in 86% of the NR subgroup and 73% of the LR subgroup. Combined treatment with captopril and beta-blocker in Group II did not decrease blood pressure any lower than with captopril alone treatment and achieved the target blood pressure in only 50% of the patients. In group III, combined treatment with captopril and thiazide achieved the target blood pressure in 100% of the patients. Plasma renin activity (PRA) was increased by captopril but reduced by captopril in combination with beta-blocker. However, when beta-blocker was replaced with thiazide, PRA increased. The serum sodium concentration was significantly reduced in the LR subgroup after a single administration of captopril, but there was no other variation.", 
    "58": "The effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition on systemic and coronary hemodynamics and on myocardial lactate metabolism were investigated before and 2 and 6 hours after cilazapril at rest and during supine submaximal exercise in 10 patients with New York Heart Association class II or III chronic congestive heart failure. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition, indicated by a significant increase in plasma renin activity, resulted in significant reductions in blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance. Myocardial oxygen demand decreased (resting double product 10.9 +/- 3.7 vs 12.2 +/- 3.8 mm Hg beats/min 10(-3); p less than 0.05), but coronary sinus blood flow remained unchanged and calculated coronary resistance decreased (0.45 vs 0.5 units, rest 6 hours; p less than 0.05) suggesting coronary vasodilatation. Changes in coronary vascular resistance were directly related to changes in systemic vascular resistance (r = 0.75, p less than 0.5). Myocardial lactate extraction increased at rest (47 +/- 60 vs 134 +/- 132 mumol/min; p less than 0.5) and during exercise (27 +/- 54 vs 491 +/- 317 mumol/min; p less than 0.05) both in patients with coronary artery disease (n = 5) and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 5). Resting lactate production was converted to lactate extraction in two patients with coronary artery disease. Neither plasma catecholamine nor atrial natriuretic peptide concentrations changed significantly. The results suggest coronary vasodilation and improved aerobic myocardial metabolism by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition in patients with congestive heart failure.", 
    "59": "In the present study, the influence of sodium ferulate (SF) on hypotensive effect and urinary excretion of TXB2 after captopril (CAP) was observed in 44 patients with essential hypertension. A single oral dose of CAP (50 mg) decreased mean arterial pressure (MAP) from 16.25 +/- 0.85 to 13.65 +/- 1.14 kPa, n = 28, (P less than 0.01), and increased urinary TXB2 excretion significantly from 119.12 +/- 57.12 to 183.32 +/- 78.61 pg/min, n = 16, (P less than 0.05). The administration of SF 300 mg/d for one day did not affect the MAP. CAP in combination with SF induced a decrease both in MAP from 16.33 +/- 1.14 to 13.83 +/- 1.77 kPa, n = 16, (P less than 0.01) and urinary TXB2 excretion from 155.89 +/- 69.64 to 133.43 +/- 60.01 pg/min, n = 16, (P greater than 0.05) though the latter was not so significant. Compared with the administration of CAP alone, the combination of CAP and SF induced stronger hypotensive effect (P less than 0.05) and the increased urinary TXB2 excretion could be inhibited by SF, but the inhibition to angiotensin converting enzyme was the same. These results suggested that the increased urinary TXB2 excretion by CAP can be inhibited and the hypotensive effect of CAP is potentiated by SF in essential hypertensive patients.", 
    "60": "The purpose of this study was to validate a two-dimensional (2D) echography coupled range-gated Doppler system for the non-invasive measurement of internal diameter, blood flow velocity, and pulse wave velocity of peripheral arteries, such as the common carotid artery (CCA), femoral artery (FA), and brachial artery (BA) in man. The array of the ultrasonic system and the Doppler probe were attached and formed a fixed angle (38 degrees 30'). The artery was firstly visualized using the echo-graphic array probe in order to position the Doppler beam. Then, the range-gated Doppler system was used to measure both internal diameter and blood flow velocity with the sample volume position covering the internal diameter. Using a hydraulic device, there was an obvious correlation between the calculated and the measured velocities (r = 0.98). Normal values of diameter, blood flow velocity and blood flow were measured in 18 healthy volunteers. The means (+/- 1 standard deviation) was as follows: diameter, CCA = 0.636 +/- 0.027 cm, FA = 0.843 +/- 0.074 cm, BA = 0.302 +/- 0.052 cm; flow velocity, CCA = 19.5 +/- 2.1 cm s-1, FA = 11.4 +/- 1.2 cm s-1, BA = 6.7 +/- 1.0 cm s-1. Blood flows were as follows: CCA, 370.6 +/- 42.5 ml mn-1, FA 387.0 +/- 75.0 ml mn-1 and BA (wrist occlusion) 29.8 +/- 12.5 ml mn-1. The intra-observer reproducibilities for CCA, FA and BA were respectively: for diameter, 4.9%, 4.12% and 14.8%; for velocity, 8.9%, 10.6% and 10.2%. The inter-observer reproducibilities were respectively: for diameter, 5.6%, 5.4% and 11.3% for velocity, 6.5%, 5.7% and 6.3%. Simultaneous determinations of pulse wave velocity from blood flow velocity recording allowed estimations of the distensibility of these arteries. Finally, the coupled echo and range-gated Doppler system permitted non-invasive evaluation of blood flow calculated as the product of the vessel cross-sectional area and measured blood velocity and also of arterial compliance as the ratio of the cross-sectional area and the square of pulse wave velocity. Such estimations of the conduit and buffering functions of peripheral large arteries in man were shown to be more accurate for the common carotid and the femoral arteries than for the brachial artery.", 
    "61": "Ambulatory blood pressure and heart rate monitoring were used for comparing the antihypertensive effect of a 1-week treatment with enalapril and lisinopril 10 mg once daily (double-blind crossover placebo-controlled study). Twelve outpatients with mild to moderate hypertension were treated. Both drugs had a significant and identical hypotensive effect. Neither drug affected the diurnal rhythm of blood pressure or heart rate. Therefore the two drugs are equipotent antihypertensive agents. Both drugs inhibited ACE activity to a highly significant extent, but in this regard lisinopril was more effective than enalapril. However, lisinopril's greater ACE inhibition was not accompanied by a greater hypotensive effect. The clinical value of this difference is not yet established.", 
    "62": "Beta-adrenoceptor blockade can influence exercise capacity negatively, but data on the effect of converting enzyme inhibition and of calcium entry blockade on exercise capacity in hypertensive sportsmen are scarce. This report deals with the effect of the various types of antihypertensive medication on endurance exercise capacity in 14 hypertensive sportsmen, aged 39 +/- 3 years and weighing 73 +/- 2 kg (mean +/- s.e.m.). The patients were treated for 3 weeks with either placebo, atenolol (50 mg/day) enalapril (10 mg/day) or verapamil (240 mg/day) following a double-blind randomized cross-over design. At the end of each treatment period, they performed an endurance exercise test on the bicycle until exhaustion at 70% of their previously determined exercise capacity. Venous blood was sampled before and after exercise. In comparison with placebo, total exercise duration was not affected by enalapril (-3 +/- 7%) or verapamil (-7 +/- 11%). During treatment with atenolol, two patients had to interrupt their intake of the beta-blocker because of side effects. In the 12 remaining subjects, exercise duration was significantly decreased by 38 +/- 12% (P less than 0.01). Atenolol also induced decreases in plasma-free fatty acid concentration before and after exercise and an increase in potassium concentration after exercise, whereas enalapril and verapamil did not induce metabolic changes. During exercise, systolic blood pressure was decreased by atenolol (P less than 0.001) and enalapril (P less than 0.01) and diastolic blood pressure by enalapril (P less than 0.001), verapamil (P less than 0.05) and atenolol(P = 0.06).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

In our study, the normal range of ACE activity and the inhibitory effect of short-term oral administration of ramipril on ACE activity in human serum and tissue samples of renal cortex, heart and blood vessels were determined. ACE activity in the renal cortex (125.2 +/- 11.5 nmol/mg per min) was greater than 600 times that of the heart (0.20 +/- 0.01 nmol/mg per min), greater than 500 times that of the veins (0.23 +/- 0.09 nmol/mg per min) and greater than 150 times that of the arteries (0.80 +/- 0.23 nmol/mg per min). ACE activity in the renal cortex and arteries 2 h after last dosing was almost completely inhibited by ramipril whereas ACE activity in the veins and heart was inhibited to a lesser extent. Our results demonstrate in man, for the first time, an inhibition of tissue ACE following short-term oral treatment with an ACE inhibitor.", 
    "64": "Monolayer cell cultures formed from the rat cauda epididymidis exhibited renin-like and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activities and contained immunoreactive angiotensin I (AI) and angiotensin II (AII). Renin-like activity, determined indirectly by radioimmunoassay of generated AI at a near-neutral pH of 6.0, was demonstrated in the cell lysate but was almost undetectable in the serum-free cell culture medium, suggesting that renin expression in epididymal cells is an intracellular phenomenon. In contrast, both AI and AII were detected in the cell lysate and cell culture medium. The level of AI was enhanced by pretreating the cells with the ACE inhibitor captopril (100 nmol/l). Incubating the cell monolayers with thoroughly washed sperm cells obtained from the intact cauda epididymides of rats increase (P less than 0.01) the AII content of the cell culture medium, with a parallel decline (P less than 0.01) in the AI concentration. However, adrenaline (0.23 mumol/l), which was found to stimulate electrogenic anion secretion by cell monolayers grown on previous supports, was without effect on the renin-like activity or concentration of angiotensins. The ACE activity in cells was confirmed by its strong dependence on chloride ion and its susceptibility to inhibition by captopril (100 nmol/l). Enzyme activity was significantly (P less than 0.005) higher in the culture medium than in the cell lysate and cell membrane fragments. Angiotensinogen, which is obligatory for an intrinsic renin-angiotensin system, is present in epididymal cells. Presumably, it is synthesized and processed in the cell cytosol by intracellular renin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "65": "A group of consecutive 180 veteran patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension were chosen to participate in clinical antihypertensive trial for the purpose of defining the role of converting enzyme inhibitors and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in the management of mild to moderate hypertension patients. After a two-week placebo period, these patients were randomly assigned to regimens of converting enzyme inhibitors (enalapril or captopril with or without diuretics) or conventional therapy (diuretics with or without traditional vasodilators with or without beta-blockers). Each patient was regularly followed up every two weeks and doses were added until the diastolic blood pressure was equal to or lower than 90 mmHg. After 1 year of follow-up, only 162 patients completed the study. All high blood pressure was significantly reduced by these three regimens, but no significant difference of blood pressure control was noted. The mean left ventricular ejection fraction increased from 55.9 +/- 6.2 to 57.5 +/- 5.3% in captopril group (P less than 0.05, n = 59) and from 54.8 +/- 6.8 to 57.2 +/- 5.8% enalapril group (P less than 0.01, n = 53), in contrast to the insignificant change in control group (n = 50) (56.5 +/- 7.7 to 56.6 +/- 5.9%). The exercise duration also significantly increased only in converting enzyme inhibitors group (P less than 0.01). Furthermore, the plasma aldosterone level was significantly reduced by converting enzyme inhibitors therapy, whereas conventional therapy had no beneficial effect (P less than 0.01). Furthermore, the plasma aldosterone level was significantly reduced by converting enzyme inhibitors therapy, whereas conventional therapy had no beneficial effect (P less than 0.001). Concomitantly, antidiuretic hormone and plasma norepinephrine levels were also significantly reduced by converting enzyme inhibitors. In addition, converting enzyme inhibitors had a favorable trend to affect the metabolism of lipid in contrast to the conventional therapy. These results show that a first-step treatment of hypertension with converting enzyme inhibitors permits better left ventricular function and improves exercise tolerance by way of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibition. Thus, converting enzyme inhibitors might be suggested as the first step regimen in the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "66": "Enalapril maleate (EN) incubated with primary cultures of rat hepatocytes was cytotoxic in concentrations of 0.5 mM or greater. Toxicity was measured by release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) into the culture medium at 24 h. SKF525A, alpha-naphthoflavone (alpha NF) and metyrapone (MTP) reduced the toxicity of EN. In vivo pretreatment with phenobarbital (PB) and beta-naphthoflavone (beta NF) had minor protective effects on the responses of hepatocytes to EN exposure. However, in vivo pretreatment with pregnenolone-16 alpha-carbonitrile (PCN) substantially potentiated EN cytotoxicity. These results suggest that the cytocidal hepatotoxicity of EN in primary culture depends to some degree on metabolic activation by a cytochrome P450 species.", 
    "67": "A total of 12 patients (mean age +/- SEM 63 +/- 2.6 years) with moderate to severe heart failure (ejection fraction = 23 +/- 3.2%) were included in a placebo-controlled crossover trial. Patients were randomly allocated to 4 periods of 6 weeks each: placebo, placebo and physical training, lisinopril 10 mg daily, and lisinopril and physical training. The exercise time increased from 13.6 +/- 0.9 min with placebo to 15 +/- 1 min with training alone, and to 16.1 +/- 0.7 min with lisinopril and training. With lisinopril alone there was a non-significant increase in exercise time, to 14.5 +/- 0.6 min. Improvements in exercise time were accompanied by a similar increase in peak oxygen consumption. Overall, the most significant improvements in symptoms and indices of cardiorespiratory fitness were achieved with a combination of lisinopril and training. Thus physical training is not only a useful adjunct to the existing medical therapy for heart failure, but it may also provide symptomatic benefits in its own right.", 
    "68": "The purpose of this study was to use a direct method, that of electron spin resonance spectroscopy, to evaluate the ability of captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, to prevent the superoxide-mediated formation of phenyl radicals. Results indicate that, under certain conditions, captopril is a potent inhibitor of the generation of phenyl radicals, produced by the autoxidation of phenylhydrazine. The inhibitory effect of captopril, however, was better understood as a direct interaction of the drug with the metals that catalyze the autoxidation process rather than as a reaction of captopril with the free radicals generated. This last conclusion was supported by the finding that captopril was not able to inhibit the superoxide anion-mediated reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium.", 
    "69": "To localize angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in the fundic mucosa of the rabbit, we used autoradiography with the ACE inhibitor [3H]-trandolaprilate and post-embedding immunocytochemical techniques with a goat anti-rabbit ACE, using fluorescence and electron microscopy. Autoradiographic localization of [3H]-trandolaprilate in rabbit fundus sections shows that ACE is present in the fundic mucosa and mainly in the gland area. Fundic mucosa was fixed with 4% formaldehyde and embedded in Lowicryl K4M. Semi-thin (1 micron) or thin sections (800-900 A) were stained with anti-rabbit ACE followed by fluorescein isothyocyanate-labeled rabbit anti-goat IgG or protein A-gold reagent, respectively. Label was present on endothelium of all blood vessels running through the mucosa. Label was prominently localized in the granules of mucous surface and neck cells and on the granules of chief cells. The intracellular localization of ACE, and particularly its intragranular presence within chief and mucous cells, suggests that the enzyme, at the fundic level, is involved in the intragranular processing of a peptide, the nature of which remains to be determined.", 
    "70": "367 patients with mild-moderate hypertension were included in a multicentre study for the purpose of examining the antihypertensive effect of six weeks of treatment with the ACE-inhibitor lisinopril 10 and 20 mg once daily. Both low-dose and high-dose lisinopril significantly reduced sitting and standing blood pressure values. The fall in blood pressure in the sitting position was slightly but significantly greater among the high-dose group compared with the low-dose group (a 3 mm Hg fall difference in systolic values and a 1 mm Hg fall in diastolic values). No such differences were found in the standing position. Heart rate remained unchanged during lisinopril treatment. Episodes of possible first dose hypotension were reported in six patients. Approximately 90% of the patients in both groups were classified as responders according to defined criteria. The frequency of side-effects was low, and was equal in both treatment groups. An evaluation of reduction in blood pressure, and of response rate and side-effects suggests that an initial dose of 10 mg lisinopril once daily is sufficient, and that this dosage will control blood pressure in the majority of patients.", 
    "71": "Atherosclerosis is the main cause of mortality in diabetic patients, and the incidence of coronary heart disease is increased in the presence of microalbuminuria. The mechanisms of this association are not known and could involve genetic factors (predisposition to hypertension), renal disease and dyslipidemia. An increase in plasma triglyceride and apoprotein B levels, a decrease in plasma HDL cholesterol, qualitative abnormalities of VLDL and HDL are related to cardiovascular risk in diabetic patients. All these factors are worsened by nephropathy. Lipoproteins abnormalities could be involved in the progression of renal injury. In microalbuminuric patients, it seems important to reduce glomerular hyperfiltration and to normalize glycemia and blood pressure in order to prevent impairment of renal injury and dyslipidemia induced by nephropathy. Early treatment of lipoprotein abnormalities could decrease the incidence of cardiovascular complications.",

Despite administration of isotonic NaCl and treatment with dopamine infusion, it did not prove possible to maintain a stable blood pressure. Adrenaline and ephedrine were required intravenously on repeated occasions on account of symptom-producing hypotension with a systolic pressure as low as 60 mmHg.

After 8 weeks, the response rate to a daily dose of Capozide 25 or 50 was 87.2%. Within this period, the mean systolic/diastolic blood pressure dropped from 175 +/- 16/103 +/- 5 mmHg to 150 +/- 13/88 +/- 7 mmHg (p less than 0.001). In 81% of the questionnaires, treatment with the combination was rated superior to the previous treatment; in only 5% was it considered inadequate. Side effects, for the most part mild, were reported by 7.4% of the patients. Treatment with Capozide was discontinued, or another form of treatment substituted in 12.9% of the cases.", 
    "74": "We compared the tubular transport of sodium and the erythrocyte sodium-lithium countertransport activity in hypertensive patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) and in normotensive control subjects. In addition, we assessed the effects of inhibition of converting enzyme on renal hemodynamics and sodium excretion in hypertensive patients with ADPKD to provide information on mechanisms responsible for the increased renal vascular resistance and filtration fraction and the adjustment of the pressure-natriuresis relationship during saline expansion, observed in patients with ADPKD, hypertension, and preserved renal function. In comparison with normotensive control subjects, the hypertensive patients with ADPKD had lower renal plasma flows, higher renal vascular resistances and filtration fractions, and similar proximal and distal fractional reabsorptions of sodium. The administration of enalapril resulted in significant increases in the renal plasma flow and significant reductions in mean arterial pressure, renal vascular resistance, and filtration fraction, but the glomerular filtration rate remained unchanged. Despite the significant reduction in mean arterial pressure during inhibition of converting enzyme, the distal fractional reabsorption of sodium decreased while the total fractional excretion of sodium remained unchanged or increased slightly. No significant differences were detected between the normotensive control subjects and the hypertensive patients with ADPKD in erythrocyte sodium-lithium countertransport activity, plasma renin activity, plasma aldosterone concentration, or atrial natriuretic factor. These results suggest that the renal renin-angiotensin system plays a central role in the alterations in renal hemodynamics and sodium management associated with the development of hypertension in ADPKD.",

The ability to retain a PA response was shown to decrease as the dose of intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) administered renin increased with maximal retention deficits occurring at 1.0 micrograms/5 microliters i.c.v. EXP3312 (1-100 micrograms/5 microliters i.c.v.) and EXP3880 (1-100 micrograms/5 microliters i.c.v.) produced dose-dependent increases in retention latencies when co-administered with renin. The peak effect dose (PED) for EXP3312 and EXP3880 was 3 and 30 micrograms i.c.v., respectively. In contrast, PD123177 was not effective in preventing the renin-induced decrease in retention across a broad range of doses (0.1-100 micrograms/5 microliters i.c.v.). Captopril (1-100 micrograms/5 microliters i.c.v.) also prevented the renin-induced performance deficit with a PED of 30 micrograms/5 microliters i.c.v. These results suggest that renin given i.c.v. produces a deficit in performance of a PA response in rats and that this effect can be attenuated by an ACE inhibitor, AII-1 receptor ligands, but not AII-2 receptor blocker.", 
    "76": "The relationship between serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity and concentration of the ACE inhibitor enalaprilat was determined in vitro in the presence of different concentrations (S = 4-200 mM) of the substrate Hip-Gly-Gly. From Henderson plots, a competitive tight-binding relationship between enalaprilat and serum ACE was found yielding a value of approximately 5 nM for serum ACE concentration (Et) and an inhibition constant (Ki) for enalaprilat of approximately 0.1 nM. A plot of reaction velocity (Vi) versus total inhibitor concentration (It) exhibited a non-parallel shift of the inhibition curve to the right with increasing S. This was reflected by apparent Hill coefficients greater than 1 when the commonly used inhibitory sigmoid concentration-effect model (Emax model) was applied to the data. Slopes greater than 1 were obviously due to discrepancies between the free inhibitor concentration (If) present in the assay and It plotted on the abscissa and could, therefore, be indicators of tight-binding conditions. Thus, the sigmoid Emax model leads to an overestimation of Ki. Therefore, a modification of the inhibitory sigmoid Emax model (called \"Emax tight model\") was applied, which accounts for the depletion of If by binding, refers to It and allows estimation of the parameters Et and IC50f (free concentration of inhibitor when 50% inhibition occurs) using non-linear regression analysis. This model could describe the non-symmetrical shape of the inhibition curves and the results for Ki and Et correlated very well with those derived from the Henderson plots. The latter findings confirm that the degree of ACE inhibition measured in vitro is, in fact, dependent on the concentration of substrate and enzyme present in the assay. This is of importance not only for the correct evaluation of Ki but also for the interpretation of the time course of serum ACE inhibition measured ex vivo. The non-linear model has some advantages over the linear Henderson equation: it is directly applicable without conversion of the data and avoids the stochastic dependency of the variables, allowing non-linear regression of all data points contributing with the same weight.",

These patients were randomised in three groups, receiving daily initially either 5 mg enalapril, 2 mg prazosin or placebo. Blood pressures and heart rates were measured once every week and in poor responders dosages were increased on a 2-weekly basis.

    "86": "The prescribing and usage patterns of two antihypertensive agents, terazosin (Hytrin) and enalapril maleate (Vasotec) were analyzed and compared over a 6-month study period, using data from the PDS Alpha Data Base. The study analyzed several variables for both physician prescribing patterns and patient responses. Overall, the two agents performed equally well during the study period, with 6-month retention rates (% of patients who continued to take the same medication) of approximately 60%. Although both drugs are judged to be good candidates for first-line antihypertensive therapy, it was observed during the study that family practitioners write considerably more prescriptions for terazosin than enalapril, while internists write more enalapril prescriptions. We concluded that these differences in prescribing and usage patterns were largely attributable to the manufacturers' marketing strategies and to how various physicians perceive the two agents, rather than to actual clinical differences between them.", 
    "87": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is an important modulator of blood pressure and fluid balance. The clinical success of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) in the treatment of hypertension has stimulated the search for antagonists of renin. Because renin is highly specific for its substrate, angiotensinogen, renin inhibitors may emerge as clinically preferable alternatives to ACEIs, which affect multiple biological systems, including bradykinin and prostaglandin metabolism. Recent advances in renin inhibitor chemistry have produced highly specific and potent, transition-state analogs of angiotensinogen. Several compounds (e.g., enalkiren, ditekiren, CGP 38560A, and RO 42-5892) have been tested in man. These renin inhibitors produce dose-dependent decreases in plasma renin activity (PRA) which are dissociated from the dose-dependent decreases in blood pressure (BP). Potential explanations for this dissociation include methodologic errors in PRA assays and alternate sites or mechanisms of drug action, including inhibition of noncirculating tissue renin. A prolonged hypotensive effect is seen following single doses of enalkiren and RO 42-5892, and repeated dosing with enalkiren results in sustained hypotensive effect without tachyphylaxis. Renin inhibitors can reduce blood pressure irrespective of baseline renin status and sodium balance. However, high-renin patients generally respond more vigorously, and the hypotensive response is enhanced by sodium depletion. In general, renin inhibitors have been safe and well tolerated in limited clinical studies. New generation renin inhibitors with higher potency and greater oral bioavailability may join the antihypertensive armamentarium.", 
    "88": "Detection of a renal artery stenosis (RAS) as a cause of arterial hypertension is of great practical importance because dilatation of the stenosis frequently results in an improvement or cure of the hypertension. In recent years, a number of screening procedures aimed at diagnosing renovascular hypertension have been developed, e.g., duplex sonography of the renal arteries, determination of plasma renin activity, or renal scintigraphy following administration of captopril. The possibilities and limitations of these screening procedures are described here. The best method for detecting renal artery stenosis is angiography, which can now be performed on an outpatient basis, using thin catheters.",

Next to hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD) is the second most frequent cause of CHF. Important distinction should be made between systolic dysfunction and diastolic dysfunction in CAD. The diagnostic and therapeutic challenges posed by both have stimulated much investigation into the pathophysiologic mechanisms involved and have led to innovative pharmacologic interventions to forestall progression of the disease. The challenge in the 1990s is prevention. In the meantime, results of completed and ongoing randomized controlled trials will determine the most effective forms of therapy, which will not only improve symptoms but also hopefully extend survival.", 
    "90": "Captopril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor that has been reported to be effective in salvaging post-ischemic reperfused myocardium by its ability to function as a free radical-scavenging agent. A study was performed in the isolated porcine-heart model evaluating the influence of pretreatment with captopril on salvage of myocardium after an induced myocardial infarction. Measurement was carried out of regional and global myocardial function, myocardial high-energy phosphate levels, creatine kinase release, malonaldehyde formation, and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha generation. In an in vitro preparation, the influence of captopril for scavenging various free radicals was evaluated. A dose-response curve was carried out using this free radical-generating system and differing levels of captopril. Results of the study demonstrate that pretreatment with captopril at a 45-mumol/L level reduced reperfusion injury in the pig heart model. This was manifested by improved cardiac performance, a reduction in creatine kinase release, and reduced malonaldehyde generation. In vitro evaluation of captopril and its free radical-scavenging ability indicated that it is a weak scavenger of superoxide anions (O2-) but behaves as a potent scavenger of hydroxyl radicals (-OH) as well as hypohalite radicals (OCl-). Based on the influence of captopril in reducing lipid peroxidation (decreased malonaldehyde formation) and its documented ability to scavenge -OH as well as OCl-, it is suggested that myocardial preservation in a postinfarction model is due primarily to its free radical-scavenging activity, primarily of the potent free radicals -OH and OCl-.", 
    "91": "We investigated the effect of inhibition of carboxypeptidase, neutral endopeptidase, or angiotensin converting enzyme on airway reactivity to intravenous bradykinin in guinea pigs. Bradykinin reactivity in intact, unanesthetized, spontaneously breathing animals was determined by measuring specific airway resistance in response to increasing doses of intravenous bradykinin or acetylcholine. We found that phosphoramidon and/or captopril (specific antagonists of neutral endopeptidase and angiotensin converting enzyme, respectively) increased airway reactivity to bradykinin, but the combination had no effect on muscarinic reactivity. Although 2-mercaptomethyl-3-guanidinoethylthiopropanoic acid (MGTA, a carboxypeptidase inhibitor) alone did not alter bradykinin reactivity, MGTA in the presence of both phosphoramidon and captopril significantly potentiated bradykinin-induced airway reactivity. In comparison, this did not affect reactivity to acetylcholine. Having found that carboxypeptidase inhibition could augment kinin-induced airway reactivity, we subsequently assayed for and identified carboxypeptidase M activity in guinea pig lung. We found considerable carboxypeptidase M activity in guinea pig lung subcellular fractions, the 100,000 x g membrane pellet having the highest specific activity. Our data indicate that airway reactivity to intravenous bradykinin is modulated by the activity of endogenous neutral endopeptidase, angiotensin converting enzyme, and carboxypeptidase, all of which are present in lung cell membranes. This study also suggests that the influence of carboxypeptidase per se may be substantially enhanced if endogenous pulmonary neutral endopeptidase and angiotensin converting enzyme activities are reduced.",

    "93": "Gut barrier failure and bacterial translocation (BT) after thermal injury may result from splanchnic vasoconstriction and intestinal ischemia. The role of the renin-angiotensin system in intestinal blood flow and BT after thermal injury was studied by pretreatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril in Wistar rats before sham or 30% scald burn. Adequacy of ACE inhibition was documented by the absence of a hypertensive response to angiotensin I, and intestinal blood flow was determined using 51Cr-labeled microspheres. Small bowel blood flow was decreased by 46% at 4-h postburn (P less than 0.05) in untreated burned animals despite maintenance of normal cardiac index but returned to baseline levels by 24 h after injury. Enalapril pretreatment resulted in maintenance of small bowel blood flow after thermal injury and was associated with a significantly reduced incidence of BT (20% vs. 75% in untreated burned animals, P less than 0.01). These findings further implicate intestinal ischemia in the etiology of gut barrier dysfunction after thermal injury, mediated in part by activation of the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "94": "A case of posttransfusion purpura is reported in a 90-year-old patient whose PlA1 antibody (anti-HPA-1a) was found to bind better to HPA-1a in the presence of captopril, a drug the patient had taken. Initially, IgG antibodies were found in the serum that reacted with normal platelets, but the binding of the antibody was increased in vitro by captopril, which suggested that captopril was responsible for the thrombocytopenia. However, in vitro studies demonstrated that the patient's platelets were negative for HPA-1a and that anti-HPA-1a was present in the serum, both of which findings were consistent with the diagnosis of posttransfusion purpura. The binding of this antibody was enhanced 50 percent by captopril in vitro, and increased binding in the presence of captopril did not occur when the anti-HPA-1a was removed. Similar results were obtained with serum containing anti-HPA-1a from another patient with posttransfusion purpura. Thus, captopril may increase the binding of anti-HPA-1a and confuse the determination of the cause of acute thrombocytopenia.", 
    "95": "Mean arterial pressure (BP) was measured in conscious, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Oral administration of the angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) CGS 16617 significantly lowered BP. In contrast, the thromboxane synthetase inhibitor (TxSI) CGS 12970 lacked an antihypertensive action in SHR. When administered concurrently, the TxSI significantly potentiated the antihypertensive actions of the ACEI. Inhibition of thromboxane synthetase did not potentiate the antihypertensive actions of metoprolol or verapamil, indicating that a specific interaction exists between a TxSI and an ACEI. The antihypertensive actions of CGS 16617 also were potentiated by the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin, a result suggesting that CGS 12970 may enhance the action of CGS 16617 by inhibiting the action of vasoconstrictor prostaglandins produced after administration of an ACEI. The potentiation of the antihypertensive actions of CGS 16617 by CGS 12970 remained unaffected by either the kallikrein inhibitor aprotinin or a bradykinin receptor antagonist. Thus, although the interaction between an ACEI and a TxSI is a prostaglandin-dependent mechanism, it is not mediated by endogenous kinins. Inhibition of thromboxane synthetase significantly stimulated renin release and significantly attenuated the pressor response to exogenously administered angiotensin II. An increase in the dependency of BP upon the renin-angiotensin system and attenuation of the vascular actions of angiotensin II may serve to explain the potentiation of the antihypertensive action of ACEI after inhibition of thromboxane synthetase. The interaction between ACEI and TxSI was not restricted to SHR, because a TxSI potentiated the actions of an ACEI in both normotensive and deoxycorticosterone acetate/Na hypertensive rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "96": "Ischemic cardiomyopathy refers to a significant impairment of left ventricular function, a condition resulting from atherosclerotic coronary artery disease. The left ventricular ejection fraction is usually 35% or less, and electron microscopy shows an increased deposition of collagen in the space between the capillaries and the myocytes. The present study shows the alteration in collagen concentration and phenotypes in ischemic cardiomyopathy, and the effect captopril treatment has on these parameters. In patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy, collagen concentration estimated from hydroxyproline increased from 7.96 +/- 1.24 mg/g to 13.9 +/- 1.30 mg/g, P less than 0.05. Ischemic cardiomyopathic patients given captopril therapy had a significantly lower collagen concentration of 10.03 +/- 1.46 mg/g, P less than 0.05. The collagen type I:III ratio decreased from 1.93 +/- 0.52 to 1.23 +/- 0.27 in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. Of these patients, those receiving captopril had a collagen type I:III ratio of 1.49 +/- 0.38, which did not differ significantly from the ratio of individuals with normal myocardium. There was no significant difference in type I collagen concentration in the myocardium of normal individuals, patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy, and patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy receiving captopril therapy. The type III collagen concentration increased significantly from 2.56 +/- 0.21 mg/g in normal myocardium to 6.10 +/- 0.58 mg/g in ischemic cardiomyopathic myocardium. Patients receiving captopril had a myocardial collagen type III concentration of 4.87 +/- 0.64 mg/g, which was significantly lower than that found in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. An increased deposition of type III collagen may be partly responsible for altering the compliance of the myocardium, resulting in dilatation of the heart and possibly leading to eventual heart failure.", 
    "97": "Converting enzyme inhibition (CEI) can prevent myointimal proliferation after arterial wall balloon injury. Because intimal proliferation is the main long-term complication of chronic vascular rejection, we tested the effect of CEI (perindopril, 1 mg/kg twice a day) on arterial rejection-induced intimal proliferation, using a model of aortic allograft in normotensive Wistar-Kyoto and spontaneously hypertensive rats. Eight-week-old rats were grafted and studied 2 months later. The structural parameters of the transplanted aortic wall were measured by morphometric analysis of specifically stained, formol-fixed sections. CEI did not prevent adventitial inflammatory infiltration but significantly increased the number of living cells and prevented the partial destruction of elastic laminae in the media, thereby increasing medial thickness to close to that of sham-operated controls. CEI significantly decreased intimal thickness and intimal collagen density, without changing the absolute number of intimal smooth muscle cells. The intimal thickness and the intimal collagen density were significantly correlated with the effect of CEI on blood pressure. CEI partially prevented the consequences of immune injury to the media within the arterial wall, probably by suppressing the proinflammatory activity of angiotensin II. It also decreased the recipient arterial wall response by acting more on the trophicity of intimal cells and on their ability to produce collagen rather than by directly inhibiting smooth muscle cell proliferation in our model of arterial allograft.", 
    "98": "The effects of cilazaprilat were assessed on endothelium-dependent relaxations and contractions in isolated canine arteries. In coronary arteries incubated with indomethacin, cilazaprilat potentiated endothelium-dependent relaxations to bradykinin. In superfusion-perfusion bioassay studies with femoral arteries, cilazaprilat augmented the release of nonprostanoid endothelium-derived relaxing factors caused by bradykinin. To verify whether this effect was solely due to inhibition of the converting enzyme, the effects of cilazaprilat on responses to a variety of endothelium-dependent vasoactive agents were assessed. Endothelium-dependent relaxations to acetylcholine, thrombin, and vasopressin were not altered significantly by cilazaprilat. However, those induced by ADP and aggregating platelets were enhanced significantly by the compound. Endothelium-dependent relaxations to ADP-beta-S were augmented significantly but to a lesser extent. Furthermore, in the presence of the nitric oxide synthase antagonist NG-nitro-L-arginine, ADP-beta-S still caused small relaxations that were possibly mediated by endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor. These relaxations were augmented by cilazaprilat. Thus, the augmentation of purinergic relaxations may involve an increased production of endothelium-derived relaxing factors in addition to the protection of ADP from breakdown. Cilazaprilat did not affect endothelium-dependent contractions to acetylcholine or the calcium ionophore A23187 in canine basilar arteries, previously shown to be mediated by superoxide anions. Thus, cilazaprilat is not a scavenger of superoxide anion. Because this agent potentiates endothelium-dependent relaxations to bradykinin, ADP, and aggregating platelets, the present study suggests that, in addition to the lowering of plasmatic levels of angiotensin II, the antihypertensive and cardioprotective effects of cilazaprilat are mediated through an increased production of endothelium-derived relaxing factors.", 
    "99": "The effects of six angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (captopril, CGS-16617, cilazapril, enalapril, utibapril, and quinapril) on cardiovascular structure, systemic hemodynamics, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, left ventricular pumping ability, and aortic distensibility were assessed in male normotensive Wistar-Kyoto and spontaneously hypertensive rats 16-19 weeks of age. Rats (10 in each group) were treated for 3 weeks with drugs or control diluents administered daily by gavage. The agents, in general, had similar hemodynamic effects, although these effects on cardiac mass were variable; some agents reduced left ventricular mass and some produced no change. These effects occurred in hypertrophied as well as nonhypertrophied chambers. Furthermore, changes in left ventricular pumping ability were not necessarily related to the ability of these agents to change left ventricular mass; this dissociation in performance was neither related to change in structure nor to changes in aortic distensibility. Thus, even within a same class of antihypertensive agents (i.e., angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors), similarly induced hemodynamic alterations were associated with inconsistent changes in left ventricular pumping ability or aortic distensibility regardless of whether the structure was hypertrophied before therapy. These dissociated responses in cardiovascular structure and function may be related to pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic differences; alternatively, they also may be related to these differences in action on local myocytic renin-angiotensin systems or in intramyocytic biological responses.", 
    "100": "Angiotensin II has been shown by many investigators to be a potent growth factor for vascular smooth cells in culture as well as in vivo. Depending on the conditions, the response of these cells is either hypertrophy or hyperplasia. These observations have important clinical implications, because it has been shown that angiotensin II participates in the hypertrophic response of the vessel wall during hypertension and the hyperplastic response after balloon angioplasty. Thus, an understanding of the molecular mechanism of these responses is important in the development of potential treatment strategies. This review examines the evidence for the growth-promoting properties of angiotensin II, concentrating on these molecular mechanisms. Hypotheses are presented that may explain the bifunctional effects (hypertrophy versus hyperplasia) of angiotensin II. These hypotheses revolve around the interaction of angiotensin with endothelium- and smooth muscle cell-derived products. These autocrine and paracrine interactions play important roles in the modulation of vascular structure.",

There is no universally applicable screening test, and it should be actively sought only in patients with clinical clues suggested by the history, physical examination, and routine laboratory testing. Hyperreninemia is a characteristic finding, and acute blockade of the renin system forms the basis of diagnostic tests such as the oral captopril test and captopril renography. Other abnormal laboratory findings include hypokalemia, proteinuria, and azotemia exacerbated by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "102": "The stimulatory effects of angiotensin (Ang) I, Ang II, and Ang III on production of diacylglycerol (DAG), a second messenger, were examined in porcine pulmonary artery endothelial cells. Ang I, Ang II, and Ang III provoked rapid increases in [3H]glycerol labeling of DAG. The stimulatory effect on DAG production was maximal after 1 and 5 min. Pretreatment of cells with angiotensin-converting enzyme activity inhibitors prevented the stimulatory effect of Ang I on DAG production, indicating that Ang II but not Ang I is responsible for increased DAG production. The stimulatory effects of Ang II and Ang III on DAG production were concentration dependent and were maximal at a 10-nM concentration of both Ang II and Ang III. Data from further experiments revealed that the Ang II- and Ang III-elicited formation of DAG is derived from the coordinated hydrolysis of membrane phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylcholine by phospholipase C- and phospholipase D-catalyzed pathways. The angiotensin analogue [Sar1 Ile8] Ang II, an Ang II receptor antagonist, blocked the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylcholine and thus the increased production of DAG by Ang II and Ang III. These results indicate that Ang II- and Ang III-induced stimulation of DAG production in pulmonary artery endothelial cells involves multiple pathways of phospholipid hydrolysis and is mediated by angiotensin receptors.",

Six episodes of reversible renal insufficiency occurred during July and August when temperatures were 32.2 degrees C to 37.8 degrees C (90 degrees F to 100 degrees F). Renal artery stenosis was excluded by renal arteriogram or ultrasonic duplex scanning. All eight group-1 patients had a significant decrease in mean arterial pressure below their baseline level during reversible renal insufficiency (mean change, -28 +/- 10 mm Hg, P less than 0.001). The increase in the serum creatinine level was inversely correlated with the decrease in the mean arterial pressure (r = -0.68, P less than 0.01). Reversible renal insufficiency was successfully managed by withdrawing or reducing enalapril as well as other antihypertensive agents. Subsequently, enalapril was tolerated by seven of the eight patients without recurrence of renal insufficiency. In contrast, none of 31 (CI, 0% to 11%) patients in group 2 developed reversible renal insufficiency despite the fact that both the incidence of decreases in mean arterial pressure in 6 of 31 patients (19%) and the magnitude of the decreases in mean arterial pressure (mean change, -33 +/- 16 mm Hg) were similar to those observed in group 1.",

For at least 6 months, 20 patients (10 males and 10 females) were treated with enalapril, and 21 (11 males and 10 females) with aracepril. The results were as follows. 1) ACE inhibitor-induced cough was induced in 7 cases (1 male and 6 females). The incident rate of cough was 17.1%. ACE inhibitor-induced cough was not significantly related to past allergic history or to the beta-adrenergic blocker therapy. The laboratory findings of the cough sufferers--such as eosinophil percent in venous blood, serum GOT and GPT, urea nitrogen, creatinine, renal function (PSP excretion test and creatinine clearance), and pulmonary function (%FVC, FEV1.0% and %V25)--were not significantly different from those of the non-coughers. 2) Inhibitory effects of ipratropium bromide inhalation of ACE inhibitor-induced cough were noted in 83.3% of the patients, but their coughs did not completely disappear. From these findings, the pathogenesis of this cough may be related to be as follows. The cough seems to be related to the release of acetylcholine from vagal nerve terminals or to the stimulation of irritant receptors and vagal reflex. 3) Chronic persistent cough or bronchial asthma did not occur after stopping the treatment with ACE inhibitors. The mean follow-up period was 15.6 months.", 
    "111": "The aim of this study was to determine the acute and chronic arterial effects of the ACE inhibitor, ramipril. Fourteen patients (mean age 47 years) with mild to moderate essential hypertension completed the study. A first haemodynamic examination was performed at the end of a 15-day placebo period (D15) before and 3 hours after oral administration of ramipril, 5 mg. Then all the patients started a 4-week treatment with ramipril, 5 mg/day. At the end of this period (D42) the haemodynamic examination was repeated 24 hours after the last capsule intake, and then 3 hours after administration of ramipril 5 mg. Brachial and carotid artery haemodynamics were evaluated by a bidimensional pulsed Doppler system. Arterial distensibility was non-invasively studied in three different arterial segments (carotido-femoral, brachio-radial, femoro-tibial) by the evaluation of the pulse wave velocity. Ramipril significantly decreased BP after acute or chronic administration. Chronic treatment with ramipril was followed by a long lasting increase in brachial artery diameter, a decrease in forearm vascular resistance, and an improvement in aortic distensibility. The other investigated arterial segments did not show any significant changes. Our results suggest that long lasting arterial effects of the ACE inhibitor ramipril are partly pressure-independent and are related to an effect of this drug on arterial tone. These effects may be able to reduce the hypertensive cardiac and arterial abnormalities.",

For stage HF I, kallikrein urinary excretion was similar to that of normal subjects, while in stage II-III patients it fell significantly. Captopril induced a drop in relevant secretion for stage I and a rise for stage II-III subjects. The drug administration did not influence the relations between the initial serum Na levels and kallikrein urinary excretion, nor it changed serum levels of Na and K. Alterations in morphofunctional characteristics of the heart and changes in diurnal urinary excretion of kallikrein demonstrated close relationships.", 
    "113": "The goal of the present study was to compare the effects of cilazapril, a new long-acting angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, to those of captopril and hydralazine on the coronary vascular bed. For this purpose, spontaneously hypertensive rats were treated for 4 months with either placebo, 10 mg/kg/day cilazapril, 100 mg/kg/day captopril, or 10 mg/kg/day hydralazine. At the end of treatment, maximal coronary blood flow was measured during maximal coronary vasodilation with adenosine in isolated perfused hearts. Cilazapril was the most effective drug in increasing maximal coronary blood flow. Captopril was less effective in improving maximal coronary blood flow but was as effective as cilazapril in reducing cardiac hypertrophy. Hydralazine had an extremely small effect on cardiac hypertrophy and maximal coronary flow reserve. The ranking of efficacy was similar for the reduction of vessel wall hypertrophy in the coronary arteries and arterioles. Because of the higher efficacy of cilazapril compared with captopril, a second experiment was performed in which 10 mg/kg/day cilazapril was compared with 100 mg/kg/day captopril and 300 mg/kg/day captopril after 1 month of treatment. Captopril increased maximal coronary flow and decreased cardiac hypertrophy to the same level as cilazapril only at the highest dose. We conclude that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, in contrast to hydralazine, can increase markedly maximal coronary flow in spontaneously hypertensive rats but that this increase does not always parallel the decrease of cardiac hypertrophy and is closely dose dependent.", 
    "114": "To determine the importance of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity in the development of arterial proliferative lesions in a primate model, the response to vascular injury was studied in five baboons treated with oral cilazapril (20 mg/kg/day) and in five untreated control animals. Each animal underwent three procedures: 1) carotid artery endarterectomy, 2) balloon catheter deendothelialization of the superficial femoral artery, and 3) surgical placement of bilateral aorto-iliac expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (Gore-Tex) vascular grafts. Cilazapril therapy was initiated 1 week preoperatively and continued throughout the study interval. At 1 and 3 weeks postoperatively, plasma ACE activity was inhibited by more than 96% versus control values. After animals were killed at 3 months, injured vessel and graft segments were evaluated morphometrically. Although the response between animals was variable, average cross-sectional areas of neointima did not differ between the cilazapril-treated and control groups at sites of carotid endarterectomy (0.26 +/- 0.12 versus 0.34 +/- 0.17 mm2, respectively; p greater than 0.5), femoral artery ballooning (0.15 +/- 0.08 versus 0.11 +/- 0.01 mm2; p greater than 0.5), or at graft anastomoses (1.86 +/- 0.50 versus 1.72 +/- 0.50 mm2; p greater than 0.5). Thus, cilazapril did not reduce intimal thickening over 3 months in these primate arterial injury models. However, a possible beneficial effect of cilazapril, which might be apparent at earlier time points or with larger animal groups, cannot be excluded.", 
    "115": "Both heparin and the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor cilazapril inhibit intimal thickening in rat carotid arteries injured by the passage of a balloon catheter. The purpose of this study was to determine if combinations of the two drugs were more effective than either drug alone and whether the effect could be accounted for by inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation. Heparin (0.1-0.3 mg/kg/hr) administered by continuous intravenous infusion with or without cilazapril (0-25 mg/kg/day p.o.) produced a dose-dependent inhibition of smooth muscle accumulation at 14 days after rat carotid ballooning. At the lower doses, the inhibitory effects of heparin and cilazapril were additive when the drugs were used together. This overall effect on growth was reflected in decreased smooth muscle cell proliferation at 2 and 7 days. A 7-day course of heparin combined with cilazapril, a regimen that might be applicable in the clinical setting, produced an 80% inhibition of intimal thickening at 28 days. These results provide evidence that heparin and cilazapril together might prove to be more effective than either drug alone in the control of intimal hyperplasia after arterial injury.", 
    "116": "Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition markedly suppresses neointima formation in response to balloon catheter-induced vascular injury of the rat carotid artery. To determine whether this effect was mediated through the vasoactive peptide angiotensin II (Ang II), two approaches were followed. First, the balloon model was used to compare the effects of continuous infusion of Ang II, with and without concurrent converting enzyme inhibition by cilazapril; second, the effects of the orally active nonpeptidic Ang II receptor antagonist DuP 753 were analyzed. Morphometric analysis was performed at 14 days after balloon injury. Animals that received continuous infusion of Ang II (0.3 micrograms/min/rat) were found to have significantly greater neointima formation in response to balloon injury than controls. Animals treated with cilazapril (10 mg/kg/day) had markedly reduced neointima formation, but in animals receiving infusion of Ang II, treatment with cilazapril did not suppress development of neointimal lesions. In the second group of experiments, DuP 753 (10 mg/kg twice daily) was as effective to prevent neointima formation as cilazapril. These data support the conclusions that converting enzyme inhibition prevents neointima formation after vascular injury through inhibition of Ang II generation.", 
    "117": "Recently, it has been shown that cilazapril could suppress neointima formation after vascular injury in rats. The goal of the present study was to confirm these findings in guinea pigs and rabbits. Vascular injury was produced by ballooning the right carotid artery of guinea pigs and the right iliac artery of rabbits. The animals were treated with either placebo or cilazapril (30 mg/kg/day and 3 mg/kg/day in guinea pigs and rabbits, respectively). Cilazapril decreased by 42% (p less than 0.001) the neointima area in the guinea pig but was ineffective in rabbits. However, in rabbits, doses of cilazapril higher than 3 mg/kg could not be given because of known toxicological effects in the rabbit. We conclude that the protective effect of cilazapril described in rats also is observed in guinea pigs. However, in rabbits, the maximal tolerated dose of cilazapril was ineffective. These results underline the importance of ongoing clinical studies to evaluate if, in humans, cilazapril inhibits restenosis after coronary angioplasty.", 
    "118": "Venous grafts implanted in the systemic circulation progressively undergo wall thickening, a phenomenon thought to be responsible for late saphenous graft disease after bypass surgery. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors recently have been shown to prevent myointimal thickening after arterial injury. Thus, the goal of the present study was to test the effects of ACE inhibition in a rat model of venous graft. For this purpose, a segment of jugular vein was interposed in the right carotid artery of normotensive rats that received either placebo or 10 mg/kg/day cilazapril, a long-acting ACE inhibitor. Three weeks later, the venous grafts and the implanted carotid arteries were fixed under perfusion and embedded for morphometric analysis. In the control group, the wall of the venous graft thickened dramatically compared with the nonimplanted contralateral jugular vein (up to 20 times increase in total cross-sectional area). On the arterial side, thickening of the wall and a neointima also were observed, most likely because of the surgical arterial injury. Cilazapril decreased by 33% (p less than 0.05) and 26% (p less than 0.01) the total cross-sectional area of the wall of the venous grafts and of the carotid arteries, respectively. Thus, these results suggest a role of the renin-angiotensin system in the early process of venous graft thickening. This study also suggests that ACE inhibitors could be a new therapeutic means to prevent late saphenous graft disease.", 
    "119": "Hypertension is associated with an endothelial dysfunction characterized by an increased endothelium-dependent contraction and a decreased endothelium-dependent relaxation. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition with cilazapril or captopril can remarkably improve the endothelial function in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). The goal of the present study was to investigate whether ACE inhibitors were acting by decreasing endothelium-dependent contraction or by increasing endothelium-dependent relaxation. Endothelial function was estimated by calculating the ratio of maximal contraction to serotonin on isolated aortic rings with endothelium to maximal contraction on paired rings without endothelium, termed the serotonin ratio. The serotonin ratio was greater than 1 in SHRs, indicating the release of a vasoconstrictor substance by the endothelium. This substance was identified as prostaglandin (PG) H2, because the serotonin ratio was significantly decreased by thromboxane (TX) A2/PGH2 receptor antagonists but not by TXA2 synthetase inhibitors. Two weeks of treatment of SHRs with cilazapril led to a marked decrease in the serotonin ratio, although acute administration of cilazaprilat was without any effect. However, after 2 weeks of treatment, the serotonin ratio still could be lowered further by TXA2/PGH2 receptor antagonists, indicating that cilazapril did not act by inhibition of PGH2 synthesis. In contrast, the effect of a 4-week treatment with cilazapril could be completely reversed by inhibiting the action of endothelium-derived relaxing factor with methylene blue. The same result was found after treatment with captopril. We speculate that ACE inhibitors improve endothelial function in SHRs not by inhibiting the synthesis of PGH2 but by increasing the release or the action of endothelium-derived relaxing factor.", 
    "120": "Treatment of chronic hypertension with cilazapril, but not hydralazine, attenuates changes in distensibility of cerebral arterioles that occur in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSPs). In this study, effects of antihypertensive treatment on composition of cerebral arterioles was determined in SHRSPs. Cilazapril (45 mg/kg/day), an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, or hydralazine (18 mg/kg/day) was begun when rats were 3 months of age. Both cilazapril and hydralazine reduced systolic arterial pressure in SHRSPs (from 199 +/- 6 to 122 +/- 7 mm Hg for cilazapril versus 143 +/- 5 mm Hg for hydralazine [mean +/- SEM]; p less than 0.05). Cerebral arterioles were fixed in vivo, and the cross-sectional area of the vessel wall was measured histologically. In SHRSPs, both cilazapril and hydralazine reduced cross-sectional area of the vessel wall to values obtained in Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. Thus, both cilazapril and hydralazine prevented hypertrophy of cerebral arterioles in SHRSPs. Composition of the arteriolar wall was determined with point counting stereology. Cerebral arterioles in SHRSPs contained significantly more smooth muscle and elastin than in WKY rats (1,294 +/- 157 versus 853 +/- 88 microns2, respectively, for smooth muscle and 148 +/- 13 versus 108 +/- 7 microns2, respectively, for elastin (120 +/- 8 microns2) in cerebral arterioles in SHRSPs was similar to that in WKY rats. Treatment with hydralazine was effective in preventing increases in elastin (128 +/- 14 microns2) and in attenuating increases in smooth muscle (1,008 +/- 18 microns2). The ratio of nondistensible (collagen, basement membrane) to distensible (smooth muscle, elastin, endothelium) components was greater in SHRSPs than in WKY rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Treatment included a calcium antagonist (CaA), alpha-methyl dopa (AMD), an alpha-blocker (ABL), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), anti-platelet agents (APL), essential amino acids (EAA), and an oral absorbent (AST-120). Changes in renal function were analyzed by comparing the degree of slopes of regression rate of the reciprocals of serum creatinine levels (R1/Cr). Administration of ACEI and EAA resulted in R1/Cr improvement after the initiation of treatment (p less than 0.05). It appears that the administration of EAA and ACEI are beneficial with regard to protection against renal failure in NIDDM patients with diabetic nephropathy.",

A mean fall of 29 per cent in urinary protein excretion was observed over the six months treatment schedule. No significant changes were observed in other parameters of renal haemodynamics measured. We conclude that Captopril therapy in patients with FSGS and IgAN reduces urinary protein excretion consistently over a six month period, and that this may in the longer term retard the progression of their renal failure.",

B 10 mg and B 20 mg, in patients with stable effort angina, compared to placebo, increased ischemic threshold and decreased ischemic ST depression at maximal work, after 2 hours but not after 10 hours. In conclusion B 10 mg and B 20 mg showed anti-ischemic activity 2 hours after drug intake.",

The molecular weight of the enzyme was estimated to be 64,000. The glial enzyme shows a similar inhibitor susceptibility to that of the enzyme of neuronal origin, and also to that of endopeptidase-24.15 (EC 3.4.24.15). Angiotensin-converting enzyme (EC 3.4.15.11) is suggested to be involved in the secondary cleavage of LHRH by the glioma cells.",

All patients underwent ophthalmological examination, fundus photography, fluorescein angiography, vitreous fluorometry, and continuous blood pressure recording within 3 h of the drug/placebo administration. The decrease in mean arterial blood pressure, from placebo treatment 149/92 +/- 17/7 to captopril treatment 132/83 +/- 14/7 mmHg (mean +/- SD), P less than 0.01 was not accompanied by a significant decrease in BRB permeability, which was 2.51 (1.24-9.15) with placebo and 3.02 (1.25-13.93).10(-7) cm/s during captopril treatment (geometric mean and-range), NS. Our study suggests that abnormal leakage through the BRB in hypertensive insulin-dependent diabetic patients with background retinopathy is caused predominantly by structural changes in the retinal vessels whereas hydrostatic forces play a minor role.",

It can be a temporarily disfiguring condition, but not usually a serious one unless the airway is compromised. In the majority of cases, no underlying cause can be identified. In this report, a case of \"idiopathic\" angioedema that occurred while performing a periodontal surgical procedure is presented. This case is interesting because the patient was on long-term use of an angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitor for hypertension, and recent evidence has shown that ACE inhibitors suppress the breakdown of circulating bradykinins. With high plasma levels of bradykinins, a local anesthetic, periodontal surgical procedures, or even emotional stress may trigger an attack of angioedema. Practitioners should be aware of the pharmacologic side effects of ACE inhibitors and be prepared to handle an emergency if a patient's airway becomes compromised.", 
    "131": "A retrospective investigation was undertaken in which the rate of decline of residual renal function (RRF), estimated from creatinine clearance, was compared in 55 continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and 57 hemodialysis (HD) patients for whom a minimum of four (mean of 7.6) well-spaced historic measurements of residual clearance were available. Because of the intrinsic variability that attends such data, specialized nonlinear, growth curve statistical methods were employed. Residual function was found to decline exponentially after the onset of therapy in both cohorts. The rate of decline in the HD group was twice that of the CAPD group (5.8% +/- 0.4% per month for HD vs 2.9% +/- 0.3% per month for CAPD; difference significant at p less than 0.0001). This difference remained highly significant (p less than 0.01) when corrected for other potential risk factors such as age, gender, hypertensive status, and use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with diabetic or other forms of glomerular nephropathy. Differences between cohorts were not significant for patients with other diagnoses (p greater than 0.1) although the size of some of these subsets was very small. The physiologic mechanism for the more rapid fall-off of RRF on HD remains speculative, but could be related to renal ischemia secondary to intratreatment hypovolemia and/or to nephrotoxic effects of the inflammatory mediators of extracorporeal circulation.",

To obtain information on regulation of the brain renin-angiotensin system, the effect of long-term administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor on brain renin and angiotensinogen mRNA was studied. 2. Spirapril (3 mg/kg) was orally administered daily for 8 weeks to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) from 12 weeks after birth. Renin and angiotensinogen mRNA in the brain and kidney were then quantitated by Northern blot analyses with [32P]-labelled rat renin and angiotensinogen cDNA as hybridization probes. Plasma renin activity (PRA), angiotensin II (AII) concentration, plasma ACE activity and brain tissue ACE activity were also measured. 3. Compared with the control group, the Spirapril-treated group had significantly lower blood pressure (P less than 0.01), significantly higher PRA (P less than 0.01), a not significantly different plasma AII concentration, and lower plasma and brain ACE activities (P less than 0.01). Interestingly, the brain renin and angiotensinogen mRNA levels of the two groups were similar, but the renal renin mRNA level was significantly higher in the Spirapril-treated group (P less than 0.01). 4. These results indicate that the mRNA levels of brain renin and angiotensinogen were not affected by chronic ACE inhibition in the circulation and suggest that AII in the brain might not be affected by systemic ACE inhibition.",

After a 2 week placebo period, 45 patients were randomised into 2 groups, the 1st group (n = 22) given sustained release verapamil (240 mg/24 h) as a single morning dose and the second (n = 23) captopril 25 (50 mg/24 h) as two daily divided doses. Treatment was given for 75 days, with the possibility of a combination of sustained release verapamil + captopril from day 45 onwards if diastolic blood pressure remained at 95 mmHg or more. After 45 days of treatment, the reduction in supine diastolic blood pressure did not differ significantly in the 2 groups (-10.4 mmHg in the sustained release verapamil group and -9.7 mmHg in the captopril), with 68.2 per cent responders to sustained release verapamil and 52.2 per cent in the captopril group. After 75 days of treatment, once again there was no significant difference in efficacy between the two groups: -14 mmHg for diastolic pressure and 80 per cent responders in patients treated with sustained release verapamil, -11.3 mmHg and 62.5 per cent responders in the captopril group. The percentage of responders was 58.3 per cent in the group treated with the combination of sustained release verapamil + captopril from day 45 onwards.

The efficacy of placebo, ISDN, 10 mg, captopril, 50-100 mg, and ISDN + captopril was evaluated in each patient by pharmacodynamic treadmill studies. The single-blind, randomized technique was applied. Captopril alone produced a weak antianginal effect. The concomitant use of ISDN and captopril showed significantly more marked and prolonged effects than ISDN alone. The highest effect was exhibited by ISDN supplemented with captopril in 6 patients who had been refractory to ISDN alone. Thus, captopril may potentiate the antianginal effect of ISDN.",

The first aim was to determine whether the fall in blood pressure, noted after the first dose of an ACE inhibitor given alone, became unacceptable when the drug was given with a diuretic. The second aim was to assess the impact of the ACE inhibitor on the biochemical abnormalities associated with thiazide diuretic therapy. The drug combination markedly reduced blood pressure but not below 110 systolic after the first dose. In the long-term the treatment significantly lowered blood pressure but did not produce any significant or clinically relevant changes in serum chemistry.",

At the same time an activation of the renin-angiotensin system occurs, with a rise in plasma renin activity (PRA) and angiotensin-II level but no change in plasma aldosterone. After administration of higher, pharmacological doses of insulin an increase in systolic blood pressure and heart rate can also be observed, while further increases in PRA and angiotensin-II are noted. To determine whether angiotensin-II is involved in observed insulin actions, we studied the renal and cardiovascular effects of three dosages of insulin (50 (Ins I), 300 (Ins II) and 500 (Ins III) mU kg-1 h-1) in healthy subjects after one week of treatment with the angiotensin-I converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril (10 mg twice a day), using the euglycaemic clamp technique. Control data were obtained from two previously conducted experiments in the same subjects, one with infusion of insulin and one with the insulin solvent only. The effect of insulin on fractional sodium excretion, blood pressure and heart rate was unaffected by enalapril, which precludes any involvement of the renin-angiotensin system with regard to these aspects of insulin action.

    "140": "Effects of continuous oral administration of captopril were investigated on acute phase in two-kidney Goldblatt hypertensive (2 KGH) rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Systolic blood pressure gradually rose throughout the experimental period of 7, 14, 21 and 28 days in both 2 KGH rats and SHR. These gradual increases of systolic blood pressure were reduced by administration of captopril in both rats. Plasma renin activity were markedly increased throughout the experimental period in both rats treated with captopril, and were modestly increased in 2 KGH rats. In contrast, those changes in plasma renin activity were not obvious in SHR. In 2 KGH rats, juxtaglomerular index (JGI) and juxtaglomerular cell count (JGCC) of the clipped kidneys increased whereas JGI of the opposite kidneys decreased. In contrast, those changes in JGI and JGCC were not obvius in SHR. On the other hand, JGI and JGCC of the clipped kidneys increased in 2 KGH rats treated with captopril and those of the both kidneys increased in SHR treated with captopril. These results suggested that juxtaglomerular cells were related to the development of hypertension in 2 KGH rats, but were not clear in SHR.

A total of 97 patients, aged between 18 and 70 years, were randomized to 5 mg oral quinapril twice daily or 25 mg captopril twice daily with maximum titration to 20 mg quinapril twice daily or 100 mg captopril twice daily. With the morning dose 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) could be added at week 4 of the double-blind phase or earlier if required for safety considerations. For the monotherapy phase, mean reductions in DBP of 12.1 mm Hg were achieved with both treatments. Clinical response rates (reduction in DBP greater than or equal to 10 mm Hg) were 58% for quinapril and 44% for captopril. At the end of therapy, with optional HCTZ, mean reductions in DBP were 19.0 mm Hg for the quinapril-treated group and 16.2 mm Hg for the captopril-treated group. None of the differences achieved statistical significance. Headache was the most frequently reported adverse event in both treatment groups with 8 reports each. No clinically significant changes in laboratory data were observed in any parameter for either treatment group. Quinapril and captopril provide comparable efficacy and safety in treatment of severe hypertension when used as initial monotherapy and with the addition of optional HCTZ.", 
    "142": "Ten healthy (aged 28 to 39) and ten heart failure NYHA II (aged 19 to 49) male subjects were prospectively studied under no drugs, under furosemide (40 mg/day), under captopril (150 mg/day) and under their association. Arterial compliance (ml/mmHg) was measured in all subjects at rest and supine. Heart failure etiology was dilated cardiomyopathy or ischemic heart disease without significant regurgitation. Arterial compliance was significantly higher in healthy than in heart failure patients in all studied conditions (p less than 0.001) (healthy = 2.2 + 0.29 vs. heart failure = 0.79 + 0.14). Neither single drug nor their association induced any change in healthy subjects. Arterial compliance progressively increased in heart failure with furosemide, captopril, and their association (no drug = 0.79 + 0.14; furosemide = 0.87 + 0.15; captopril = 0.94 + 0.15 and furosemide + captopril = 0.99 + 0.14). Captopril induced a higher increment than furosemide (p less than 0.001) and their association even a higher increment (p less than 0.001) than any single drug. Thus captopril and/or furosemide increased arterial compliance in heart failure but not in healthy subjects, possibly through changes in arterial wall edema and smooth muscle contraction.", 
    "143": "In experiments on rats, the physiological effects of the antihypertensive humoral system of the renal medulla were explored. We studied the parameters of blood pressure, heart rate, efferent sympathetic nervous activity to the splanchnic region, diuresis and natriuresis. The experimental situations included studies on normotensive rats, injected with extracted renomedullary lipids (medullipin), and normotensive rats extracorporally cross-perfusing an isolated kidney at increased pressure levels, to explore the release of renomedullary depressor substances. Spontaneously hyperactive rat (SHR) kidneys were also cross-perfused to study whether the renomedullary mechanism was reset upwards in this type of primary hypertension. Finally, the acute pressure reductions caused by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors were studied in intact and chemically medullectomized (2-bromo-ethylamine hydrobromide) rats to explore whether they were at least in part dependent on an intact renal medulla. In normal kidneys the renomedullary depressor system was initiated already at physiological pressure levels (at or above 100 mm Hg), causing the following humorally induced response pattern: the blood pressure fall was associated with decreases in both heart rate and sympathetic activity, while diuresis and natriuresis increased. In SHR kidneys, perfusion pressure had to be raised between 200 and 250 mm Hg before this depressor pattern was activated, revealing an \"upward renomedullary resetting\" well beyond the prevailing SHR blood pressure. The acute blood pressure decrease initiated in normotensive rats by an ACE-inhibitor (enalaprilat) was abolished in medullectomized rats, indicating an interaction between the renin-angiotensin and the renomedullary antihypertensive systems.",

It was found that enalapril (1 micrograms/ml) increases gj by 106 +/- 3.1% (SEM) (n = 20) within 4 min. The effect of enalapril on gj was not suppressed by propranolol (10(-6) M) or by a cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor. Angiotensin II (1 micrograms/ml) reduced gj by 55%. These observations might indicate that an intrinsic renin-angiotensin system in heart is involved in the control of gj in cardiac muscle.", 
    "145": "The relative contributions of the hemodynamic and morphological (vascular and cardiac) modifications induced by long-term administration of an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor, quinapril, to the drug's long-lasting preventive effects vis-\u00e0-vis genetic hypertension development (GHD) have been investigated in young spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Two groups of SHRs were given quinapril (10 mg/kg/day) or distilled water from 5 to 20 weeks of age. The drug was then stopped, but observations continued for another 7 weeks. At selected times systemic and regional hemodynamic parameters as well as cardiac and vascular morphological effects were investigated. During the treatment period, quinapril partially opposed GHD and limited the early rise in total peripheral and regional vascular resistances observed in control animals. Quinapril's partial preventive effect vis-\u00e0-vis GHD persisted, but faded after treatment withdrawal. From a morphological point of view, quinapril strongly opposed aortic wall hypertrophy as evidenced by significant reductions in media thickness and wall to lumen ratio and by a significant increase in aortic nuclear density. Quinapril also limited vascular fibrosis development. At the cardiac level, quinapril reduced heart weight to body weight ratio and opposed myocardial hypertrophy and cardiac collagen synthesis. All these vascular and cardiac morphological changes were delayed (starting after 9-15 weeks of treatment) as compared to quinapril's hemodynamic effects. Finally, the drug's vascular and cardiac antihypertrophic properties persisted after treatment withdrawal. In conclusion, our data indicate that the early systemic and regional hemodynamic effects of quinapril initiate its antihypertensive action, but the drug-induced delayed and prolonged vascular morphological changes later take over and may be partly responsible for quinapril's residual blood pressure lowering effects after treatment withdrawal.", 
    "146": "The acute hemodynamic, hormonal, and pharmacokinetic responses to the oral angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor spirapril were studied in 15 patients with moderate to severe congestive heart failure in a baseline controlled dose-ranging study. Doses of 0.3, 1.0, 1.5, 3.125, and 6.25 mg were investigated for 24 h in three groups of five patients each. All doses demonstrated a significant reduction in serum ACE, even after 24 h. Significant reductions in mean arterial pressure, systemic vascular resistance, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure were observed with doses greater than 1.0 mg spirapril. Maximal significant hemodynamic effects occurred approximately 4-6 h after drug administration. The plasma concentrations of spirapril and its metabolite spiraprilate were dose-dependent. After administration of spirapril, the quick rise to the peak level of spiraprilate suggests rapid metabolism of spirapril into spiraprilate and a slow elimination of this metabolite. No severe hypotension or other serious side effects occurred in the patients studied. The results indicate that spirapril may be expected to be an effective drug in the treatment of congestive heart failure. From our findings we conclude that 1.5 mg spirapril is an optimal starting dose in patients with moderate to severe congestive heart failure.", 
    "147": "Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition in heart, kidney, and serum were studied ex vivo after oral administration of lisinopril (10 mg/kg), zofenopril (10 mg/kg), and captopril (30 mg/kg) to rats to study the time course, degree, and sites of inhibition of ACE by a quantitative in vitro autoradiography and enzymatic assay. ACE activity in all regions of the heart, kidney, and serum was markedly reduced 4 h after administration of lisinopril and zofenopril and only partially recovered toward control levels at 24 h. After captopril treatment, ACE activity was partially inhibited in heart, kidney, and serum at 1 h and fully recovered toward control levels in most regions at 24 h. These results suggest that these inhibitors reduce ACE in all regions of the heart and kidney without regional selective inhibition. Lisinopril and zofenopril at these doses produced longer-lasting ACE inhibition than captopril. ACE recovery after ACE inhibitor treatment in serum was faster than in heart or kidney.", 
    "148": "The newborn heart is an excellent model in which to study cardiac growth because the neonatal period is a normal situation in which the left ventricle (LV) grows rapidly and the right ventricle grows slowly. Accelerated LV growth is in response to mechanical, neural, and endocrine changes at birth. Faster growth of the LV is accounted for by greater capacity for protein synthesis, as evidenced by greater RNA content. At 18 h of life, ribosomes are formed in preference to total heart protein, but at 48 h of life, faster rates of both ribosome formation and total protein synthesis are observed. In the LV of hearts from 2-day-old pigs, these rates are insensitive to the addition of glucagon, 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine, or a combination of norepinephrine and propranolol. These observations could result because of maximal growth stimulation already present in the LV of the newborn heart. To restrain LV growth in the neonatal period, we treated pigs with enalapril maleate, an angiotensin II-converting enzyme inhibitor. Enalapril blocked growth of the LV as well as the increase in RNA content. When hearts from enalapril-treated pigs were perfused in vitro, rates of protein synthesis and ribosome formation in the LV were lower. These studies suggest that angiotensin II is an important factor accounting for rapid growth of the neonatal heart in response to pressure overload at birth.", 
    "149": "The effects of angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on circulatory regulating mechanisms in congestive heart failure (CHF) were studied by comparison of plasma levels of catecholamines, neuropeptide Y-like immunoreactivity (NPY-LI), substance P (SP-LI), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP-LI), vasopressin (ADH-LI), atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP-LI) and renin activity (PRA) in patients with severe CHF (NYHA III-IV) with (n = 15) or without (n = 17) ACE inhibitors in addition to digoxin and diuretic therapy. Data were also compared with those for healthy subjects (n = 31) and patients with moderate CHF (NYHA I-II). Catecholamines and NPY-LI were increased to the same extent in both groups with severe CHF. CGRP-LI showed no changes relative to controls in any of the patient groups, and was not affected by ACE inhibitors. The SP-LI level was significantly increased in all patient groups. Patients with severe CHF on ACE inhibition had a SP-LI level of 4.05 +/- 0.79 pmol l-1, compared to a concentration of 2.28 +/- 0.30 pmol l-1 (P less than 0.05) in the patient group with a comparable degree of CHF but without ACE inhibition. In the latter group, an inverse relationship appeared between the SP-LI and the serum sodium levels (r = -0.68, P less than 0.05). The patients with severe CHF who received ACE inhibitors had significantly lower ADH-LI levels than the patients with a comparable degree of CHF who were not treated with ACE inhibitors, while the ANP-LI levels was increased to a similar extent in both groups.", 
    "150": "The effects of doxazosin (alpha-1-inhibitor) and enalapril (ACE-inhibitor) on blood pressure and exercise stress test were assessed in 10 hypertensive patients (8 M, 2 F, age 58 +/- 9 years) with coronary artery disease and exertional myocardial ischemia. A single blind, cross-over, placebo controlled trial was performed. Placebo was administered for 2 periods of 2 weeks, doxazosin and enalapril for at least 3 weeks. The sequence of the active drugs was randomized and the single daily dose, obtained by titration, was 7 +/- 5 mg for doxazosin and 18 +/- 13 mg for enalapril. Blood pressure measurements and treadmill tests (Bruce protocol) were performed at the end of each period. Rest systolic and diastolic pressures after placebo were respectively 173 +/- 15 and 106 +/- 9 mmHg and were reduced to 153 +/- 11 and 93 +/- 12 mmHg (p less than 0.05) after doxazosin and to 150 +/- 24 and 93 +/- 12 mmHg (p less than 0.05) after enalapril. Total exercise time was 473 +/- 91 s after placebo and increased to 545 +/- 84 s (p less than 0.05) after doxazosin and 529 +/- 100 s (p less than 0.05) after enalapril. Time to 1 mm ST depression (ST1) was 297 +/- 102 s after placebo and increased to 414 +/- 96 s (p less than 0.05) after doxazosin and to 396 +/- 133 s (p less than 0.05) after enalapril. Double product at peak exercise and at ST1 were respectively 26.3 +/- 2.8 and 22.1 +/- 2.8 x 10(3) and remained unchanged after enalapril and doxazosin. Peak exercise diastolic blood pressure was 107 +/- 5 mmHg after placebo, was reduced to 94 +/- 15 mmHg (p less than 0.05) after doxazosin and was unchanged after enalapril (101 +/- 10 mmHg, NS). Thus, doxazosin and enalapril induced a comparable decrease of rest blood pressure and a similar increase of exercise time in hypertensive patients with exertional myocardial ischemia. Doxazosin but not enalapril reduced exercise diastolic blood pressure.", 
    "151": "Recently it has been observed that ejaculated human sperm possess high angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity and that this enzyme is released during the process of capacitation. This observation raises the possibility that ACE may be involved in the fertilization process. To verify this hypothesis, we tested the effects of a potent ACE inhibitor, Captopril, on acrosome reaction induced by capacitating medium (3.5% HSA-added BWW) and on ability of human capacitated spermatozoa to penetrate zona-free hamster oocytes. Addition of Captopril (100 nmol l-1) modified neither sperm motility nor viability at any time considered, but significantly reduced the acrosome reaction percentages of sperm incubated in capacitating medium. Furthermore, Captopril significantly reduced the percentage of penetrated oocytes. The mean penetration rates both in the absence and presence of Captopril were 65.5 +/- 4.9% and 26.9 +/- 2.3% (P less than 0.001) respectively. These findings provide evidence that sperm release of ACE during capacitation may have a physiological role in the regulation of the mechanisms that allow sperm acrosome reaction and thus fertilizability.",

The peak reduction in sitting systolic and diastolic BP occurred approximately 6 hours post dose in both groups. At 8 hours post dose lisinopril had reduced sitting systolic and diastolic BP by 2.9 mmHg and 3.5 mmHg (P = 0.02) respectively, more than enalapril with similar results for standing BP. One patient on enalapril developed first dose postural hypotension. After 12 weeks' therapy lisinopril produced a greater decrease (P less than 0.05) in BP than enalapril. Sitting BP decreased by 25/15 mmHg on lisinopril and 17/12 mmHg with enalapril. Standing BP decreased by 24/14 mmHg compared with 16/10 mmHg on enalapril. Eighteen patients did not complete the study, 8 on lisinopril (6 adverse events, 1 uncontrolled BP, 1 protocol violator) and 10 on enalapril (8 adverse events, 1 uncontrolled BP, 1 protocol violator). Overall, the results indicated that while both drugs are well tolerated, the dose range of lisinopril 10-40 mg may produce a greater antihypertensive effect than enalapril 5-20 mg.", 
    "153": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are known to lower urinary protein excretion in human renal disease. This proteinuria lowering effect of ACE inhibition has been hypothesized to be a result of renal hemodynamic changes due to the inhibition of angiotensin II (Ang II) production. To test this hypothesis we studied the short-term effects of different doses of exogenous Ang II (5%, 10% and 20% of the pressor dose) on renal hemodynamics and urinary protein excretion in comparison with placebo infusion in six non-diabetic normotensive proteinuric patients, both before and after three months treatment with the ACE inhibitor, lisinopril. Lisinopril lowered proteinuria from 7.5 +/- 1.9 to 2.7 +/- 0.6 g/24 hr and induced a fall in blood pressure, renal vascular resistance and filtration fraction, whereas plasma Ang II levels were similar to the pre-treatment values. Ang II infusion induced typical effects which appeared to be similar before and during lisinopril treatment: a dose-related fall in renal plasma flow and rise in systemic blood pressure, renal vascular resistance and filtration fraction, while the glomerular filtration rate remained relatively stable. However, neither before nor during lisinopril therapy did any changes in urinary protein loss occur during the infusions of Ang II, despite the fact that Ang II reversed the long-term systemic and renal hemodynamic changes induced by the ACE inhibitor. We conclude that the long-term antiproteinuric effect of the ACE inhibitor, lisinopril, is neither mediated through changes in circulatory Ang II levels nor influenced by acute changes in systemic and renal hemodynamics, suggesting a non-hemodynamic mechanism of action.",

Atrial natriuretic peptide caused a rise in urinary excretion of sodium and urinary flow in the controls, whereas no increases were observed in the patients. Both proximal and distal fractional reabsorption of sodium, as evaluated by the lithium clearance technique, decreased less in the patients than in the controls. Basal plasma concentrations of atrial natriuretic peptide and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), and the basal urinary excretion of cGMP, were elevated in the patients. The increases in both plasma and urinary cGMP after administration of atrial natriuretic peptide were blunted in heart failure. Basal glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow were reduced, and filtration fraction increased, in the patients. A positive correlation (r = 0.958, P less than 0.01) was found between renal plasma flow and the relative increase in urinary excretion of sodium in the patients with heart failure. Treatment with captopril did not improve the natriuretic and diuretic effect of exogenous atrial natriuretic peptide, but resulted in an increase in filtration fraction after administration of atrial natriuretic peptide not present before captopril.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Concomitant therapy included thrombolytic treatment (29), intravenous metoprolol (34), intravenous nitroglycerin (16) and intravenous furosemide (15). The first 40 patients included had systolic blood pressure at baseline greater than or equal to 110 mmHg. Intravenous bolus injections of 0.2-1.2 mg (mean 1.0 mg) enalaprilat in one hour were given to 20 patients and an intravenous infusion of 1 mg over two hours was administered to another 20 patients, as well as to a separate group of 8 patients with systolic blood pressure between 100-109 mmHg at baseline. The infusion was stopped in five cases when the systolic blood pressure fell below 100 and 90 mmHg, respectively, in the two infusion groups. No hypotensive reactions were symptomatic. Blood pressure decreased from a mean of 134/82, 131/79 and 106/72 mmHg to a minimum of 117/71, 118/73 and 97/63 mmHg, respectively, in the three groups. Almost complete suppression of plasma angiotensin converting enzyme activity was achieved within 30 minutes. No significant changes were found in plasma levels of angiotensin II, renin activity or atrial natriuretic peptide between baseline and 24 hours. Treatment was continued with oral enalapril 2.5-10 mg/day, which was generally well tolerated. We conclude that intravenous and oral enalapril added to conventional therapy in the early phase of acute myocardial infarction is well tolerated in selected patients, but should be carefully titrated.",

This study was designed to examine the production of certain eicosanoids (prostaglandin E2), prostacyclin (as 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha) and thromboxane A2 (as thromboxane B2) by glomeruli isolated from normotensive Wistar-Kyoto and spontaneously hypertensive rats both before and after the administration of one of three angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, captopril, enalapril or fosinopril, for 10 days. 2. Measurements of glomerular eicosanoid production were made under basal conditions and in the presence of excess exogenous arachidonic acid. 3. The production of prostaglandin E2, 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha and thromboxane B2 was greater by glomeruli from untreated spontaneous hypertensive rats (prostaglandin E2 2.24 +/- 0.41, 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha 1.20 +/- 0.13 and thromboxane B2 2.75 +/- 0.43 ng 10 min-1 mg-1 of protein) than by those from Wistar-Kyoto rats (prostaglandin E2 1.41 +/- 0.28, 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha 0.98 +/- 0.11 and thromboxane B2 1.29 +/- 0.24 ng 10 min-1 mg-1 of protein) under basal conditions. However, these differences only achieved statistical significance for thromboxane B2 (P less than 0.01). Similar strain-related differences were noted in the presence of arachidonic acid. 4. The ratio of glomerular (prostaglandin E2 + prostacyclin)/thromboxane A2 production was significantly lower in spontaneously hypertensive rats than in their normotensive counterparts under basal conditions with values of 1.3 +/- 0.18 and 2.2 +/- 0.20, respectively (P less than 0.01). 5.

    "157": "1. A sustained high glomerular filtration rate in diabetes mellitus is associated with increased proximal reabsorption, suggesting alterations in the tubuloglomerular feedback system. To test this hypothesis, renal function was studied in eight control subjects and 14 recent-onset euglycaemic insulin-dependent diabetic patients before and after infusion of the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, acetazolamide (5 mg/kg body weight). 2. Acetazolamide induced a dramatic fall in glomerular filtration rate in both diabetic patients and control subjects (from 138 +/- 5 to 114 +/- 4 and from 127 +/- 3 to 113 +/- 2 ml min-1 1.73 m-2, respectively, P less than 0.0001). This fall in glomerular filtration rate was strongly correlated with the acetazolamide-induced decrease in absolute proximal reabsorption calculated by using lithium clearance. 3. To further assess the potential role of angiotensin II in the acetazolamide-induced tubulo-glomerular feedback response, 11 additional diabetic patients were investigated before and after the administration of acetazolamide plus the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, enalaprilat (1.25 mg intravenously). Despite the effective blockade of angiotensin II formation and a slight decrease in renal vascular resistance, the glomerular filtration rate fell significantly and by a similar magnitude as seen with acetazolamide alone. 4. These results indirectly suggest that there is an altered basal tubulo-glomerular feedback system in diabetic patients but a normal response to the increase in distal delivery. No convincing role for an angiotensin II-mediated effect on the afferent limb of the tubuloglomerular feedback response could be demonstrated.", 
    "158": "Control of hypertension improves the course of renal disease. We compared the renal hemodynamic and permselective responses to an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI) (enalapril) and an alpha 1-antagonist (prazosin) in 14 patients with established glomerular disease. A single-blinded, randomized, cross-over design was used consisting of a 3-week baseline period followed by two 4-week treatment periods, which were separated by a 4-week washout period. During the treatment periods, the CEI or alpha 1-antagonist was added to the patients' baseline antihypertensive medications. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was reduced to similar levels by both drugs, although the time-averaged blood pressure throughout the study was higher with the alpha 1-antagonist. Twenty-four-hour urinary protein, albumin, and IgG excretion were not significantly different at the end of the CEI and alpha 1-antagonist periods. However, compared with baseline values, significant decreases in total protein and IgG excretion occurred only during the CEI period, while albumin excretion decreased with both drugs. A 22% decrease in the fractional clearance of albumin (4.95 +/- 1.44 to 3.88 +/- 1.57 x 10(-3); P less than 0.01) and a 49% decrease in the fractional clearance of IgG (1.58 +/- 0.42 to 0.81 +/- 0.28 x 10(-3); P less than 0.001) occurred during CEI therapy with no significant changes in these parameters being seen with alpha 1-antagonist therapy (albumin: 4.95 +/- 1.44 to 4.48 +/- 1.51 x 10(-3), P = NS; IgG: 1.58 +/- 0.42 to 1.71 +/- 0.70 x 10(-3), P = NS). At the time of the fractional clearance measurements, MAP proved to be lower on the CEI. Reanalysis of the data for the subgroup of 11 patients without differences in MAP during the clearance period demonstrated a beneficial effect favoring CEI. Except for the greatest decreases in blood pressure (21 to 30 mm Hg), a greater antiproteinuric effect for a given decrease in blood pressure was seen with the CEI. Additionally, reduction in proteinuria occurred in a subset of seven patients whose baseline MAP was in the normotensive range. In conclusion, lowering MAP improves proteinuria. CEI appears to exert a more favourable effect even at similar MAP. Reductions in blood pressure, even within the accepted normal range, lessen permselective defects.",

Patients were studied on 3 separate in-hospital days. On the first study day patients received placebo alone. On day 2 they received intravenous bolus doses of enalkiren (0.03 to 1.0 mg/kg), and on day 3, intravenous bolus doses of enalaprilat (0.625 to 1.25 mg). Each agent reduced systolic (p less than 0.01) and diastolic (p less than 0.01) blood pressure (BP) from baseline levels. The acute decrease in systolic BP of 18.5 +/- 0.4 mm Hg during enalkiren tended to be greater (p less than 0.01) than the decrease of 12.6 +/- 0.7 mm Hg during enalaprilat. Decreases in diastolic BP during enalkiren (11.9 +/- 0.4 mm Hg) were also slightly greater (p less than 0.1) than those during enalaprilat (9.2 +/- 0.4 mm Hg).

    "160": "We studied whether inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme stimulates the formation of nitric oxide and prostacyclin in cultured human and bovine endothelial cells by an enhanced accumulation of endothelium-derived bradykinin. Nitric oxide formation was assessed in terms of intracellular cyclic GMP accumulation, prostacyclin release by a specific radioimmunoassay. Inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme by ramiprilat dose- and time-dependently increased the formation of nitric oxide and prostacyclin. These increases, peaking within 10 minutes, were maintained for at least 60 minutes. The ramiprilat-induced cyclic GMP increase was completely abolished by the stereospecific inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, NG-nitro-L-arginine. The B2-kinin receptor antagonist, Hoe 140 (0.1 microM), markedly attenuated the cyclic GMP accumulation and abolished the increase in prostacyclin release. The supernatant of endothelial cells, incubated with ramiprilat (0.3 microM) for 15 minutes, elicited a significant nitric oxide release (as assessed by a guanylyl cyclase assay) in untreated endothelial cells used as detector tissue. Preincubation of the detector cells with Hoe 140 completely abolished this nitric oxide release. These data indicate that cultured endothelial cells from different species are capable of producing and releasing bradykinin into the extracellular space in amounts that lead to a sustained stimulation of nitric oxide and prostacyclin formation, provided that bradykinin degradation is prevented by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition. Thus, the protective effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors observed on endothelial vasomotor function in hypertension may be explained by the local accumulation of endothelium-derived bradykinin that acts in an autocrine and paracrine manner as potent stimulus for endothelial autacoid formation.", 
    "161": "Circulatory responses to isoflurane and halothane anesthesia were studied in eight rabbits with biventricular cardiomyopathy induced by doxorubicin (Adriamycin, 14 mg/kg IV over 7 wk) and in eight controls (saline injections). In preliminary operations pulsed-Doppler flow probes were placed on the ascending aorta, left renal artery, and lower abdominal aorta. Each group was studied after 4, 6, and 7 wk of treatment. The development of congestive heart failure (CHF) was associated with decreases in mean arterial pressure and cardiac output (CO) of 14% and 16%, respectively, (P less than 0.05) and an increase in heart rate. In controls, each anesthetic agent produced dose-related decreases in mean arterial pressure and increases in heart rate, but not significant changes in CO. Renal blood flow was reduced to a similar degree by 1.3 MAC halothane (24% decrease) and 1.3 MAC isoflurane (21% decrease); hindlimb blood flow was reduced only by halothane. As CHF developed there was an attenuation of the heart rate response to anesthesia. Halothane, but not isoflurane, significantly reduced CO in more advanced stages of CHF. The changes in renal blood flow and hindlimb blood flow with each anesthetic in the CHF group were similar to those observed in controls and did not vary with week of treatment. Administration of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalaprilat (0.2 mg/kg IV) reversed the CO and renal blood flow effects of halothane except after 7 wk of treatment in the CHF group, when the combination of halothane and enalaprilat resulted in severe circulatory depression.",

Batchwise cultures led to an accumulation of acetate, which was not utilized in a yeast extract-free medium. After glucose exhaustion, growth stopped and enzyme activity decreased. Whereas yeast extract allowed acetate assimilation and growth, peptone stabilized the enzymatic activity. The addition of both compounds resulted in optimal performances for enzyme production.", 
    "163": "Nitroglycerin and the organic nitrates (RONO2) can be considered prodrugs that require conversion to an active intracellular moiety that initiates vascular smooth muscle relaxation. Vasodilation of veins and arteries occurs when the enzyme guanylate cyclase (GC) is activated, initiating the conversion of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP); this is the final pathway for vascular dilation caused by the nitrovasodilators (organic nitrates, sodium nitroprusside, and molsidomine) as well as endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF). The common denominator appears to be the intracellular production of nitric oxide (NO), which is the activated product of organic nitrate denitration. Nitrate tolerance has been associated with a relative depletion or unavailability of thiol groups that are involved in the initial step of denitration of RONO2. Sulfhydryl groups (SH) are oxidized during this process; with continuous nitrate exposure, decreased nitrate metabolism within the vascular smooth muscle cell occurs as a direct result of the depletion of reduced SH groups. Thus, less NO is formed and cGMP production is diminished, with a subsequent decrease or absence of vasodilation. In addition, SH groups or thiols are required for the production of S-nitrosothiols (RSNO). These short-lived compounds have been identified as an end product of organic nitrate metabolism and as possibly obligatory for the induction of GC. It is unclear, however, as to whether S-nitrosothiols are a necessary by-product of NO production from organic nitrates. It appears that RSNO can be formed outside the cell membrane and may be able to induce vasorelaxation after penetrating the cell and initiating GC activation. Exogenous SH donors, particularly N-acetylcysteine (NAC), have been employed to provide intracellular thiols in efforts to prevent or reverse nitrate tolerance. Nitrate physiologic actions are accentuated following NAC administration in the absence of tolerance. Although controversial, the concept that NAC or other thiols might be able to prevent the development of nitrate tolerance is being actively studied in laboratories around the world. Methionine has also been utilized as an SH donor with some success. Not all data are consistent, however, and the ultimate role of thiol donors for the prevention or reversal of nitrate tolerance remains uncertain. Finally, there has been considerable interest in supplying thiols by use of the SH-containing angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, such as captopril. This approach does not seem promising, probably because insufficient thiol can be supplied by therapeutic dosages of these drugs.",

    "165": "DuP 753 (or EXP3174) and PD123177 are nonpeptide angiotensin (AII)-specific ligands, which show high affinities for two AII receptor subtypes, i.e. AT1 and AT2 sites, respectively. In furosemide-treated conscious dogs with high renin, DuP 753 and EXP3714, but not PD123177, were as effective as captopril in lowering blood pressure. Both DuP 753 and EXP3174 exhibited selective vascular antagonism of AII. In conscious dogs with normal renin, DuP 753, but not captopril or EXP3174, caused a dose-dependent but transient decrease in blood pressure. In anesthetized dogs, DuP 753 and captopril caused similar renal vasodilatation and natriuresis. The renal hemodynamic effects of DuP 753 and captopril were more pronounced in dogs with sodium depletion. These results suggest that the AT1 receptor mediates the pressor and renal effects of AII in dogs. The acute transient hypotensive effect of DuP 753 in normal-renin conscious dogs is probably unrelated to AII antagonism.",

The synthesis time was 1 hr with an average radiochemical yield (EOS) of 12% and a specific activity of greater than 300 Ci/mmol. In vivo biodistribution in rats at 30 min after administration showed high uptakes into organs known to have high ACE concentration (lung, kidney and aorta) and faster clearance of 18FCAP for lung and kidney, compared to the clearance from the aorta. When different amounts of unlabeled 4-cis-fluorocaptopril (SQ 25750) were coinjected in rats, a dose of greater than 5 micrograms/kg decreased the lung uptake by one-half while only 1 microgram/kg decreased the kidney uptake by one-half. In general, the binding in the four tissues studied was saturable with the expected capacity. 18FCAP was administered to a human and displaceable uptake observed in the lung and kidney.

    "171": "Several antihypertensive agents have been found to influence serum lipid profiles. Thiazide diuretics increase total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride levels and slightly reduce high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Most beta-blockers substantially increase triglycerides and lower HDL cholesterol. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel antagonists, alpha- and beta-blockers, and beta-blockers with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity are lipid neutral. alpha 1-Antagonists (e.g., terazosin and prazosin) lower total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride levels and improve total cholesterol/HDL ratios. Observational epidemiologic studies indicate that the lipid effects of antihypertensive agents are large enough to account for substantial differences in the predicted incidence of coronary heart disease. Combination therapy with the alpha 1-antagonist terazosin plus either thiazides or beta-blockers also ameliorates the adverse lipid effects of these agents used alone. A reasonable approach to managing the lipid problems often associated with hypertension is to advise a cholesterol-lowering, low-sodium diet and weight reduction and to select drugs that alone or in combination do not adversely affect lipid profiles.", 
    "172": "Captopril ((2S)-1-(3-mercapto-2-methyl-propionyl)-L-proline) inhibited the bifunctional, Zn(2+)-containing enzyme leukotriene A4 hydrolase/aminopeptidase reversibly and competitively with Ki = 6.0 microM for leukotriene B4 formation and Ki = 60 nM for L-lysine-p-nitroanilide hydrolysis at pH 8. Inhibition was independent of pH between pH 7 and 8, the optimum range for each catalytic activity. Half-maximal inhibition of leukotriene B4 formation by intact erythrocytes and neutrophils required 50 and 88 microM captopril, respectively. In neutrophils and platelets neither 5(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, 12(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, nor leukotriene C4 formation were reduced, indicating selective inhibition of leukotriene A4 hydrolase/aminopeptidase, not 5-lipoxygenase, 12-lipoxygenase, or leukotriene C4 synthase. In whole blood, captopril inhibited leukotriene B4 formation with an accompanying redistribution of substrate toward formation of cysteinyl leukotrienes. The decrease in leukotriene B4 was more substantial than the corresponding increase in cysteinyl leukotrienes suggesting that nonenzymatic hydration predominates over transcellular metabolism of leukotriene A4 by platelets during selective inhibition of leukotriene A4 hydrolase. Enalapril dicarboxylic acid and Glu-Trp-Pro-Arg-ProGln-Ile-Pro-Pro which inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme: angiotensin I, bradykinin, and N-[3-(2-furyl)acryloyl]Phe-Gly-Gly which are substrates; and chloride ions which activate angiotensin-converting enzyme did not modulate leukotriene A4 hydrolase/aminopeptidase activity. The results indicate that: (i) the sulfhydryl group of captopril is an important determinant for inhibition of leukotriene A4 hydrolase/aminopeptidase, probably by binding to an active site Zn2+; (ii) aminopeptidase and leukotriene A4 hydrolase display differential susceptibility to inhibition; (iii) there is minimal functional similarity between angiotensin-converting enzyme (peptidyl dipeptidase) and leukotriene A4 hydrolase/aminopeptidase; (iv) captopril may be a useful prototype to identify more potent and selective leukotriene A4 hydrolase inhibitors.", 
    "173": "The effects of exogenous and of endogenous angiotensin on noradrenaline overflow were investigated in saline perfused rat hearts with intact sympathetic nerves. The overflow of endogenous noradrenaline induced by electrical stimulation of the left stellate ganglion was determined in the coronary venous effluent by HPLC. The activity of the renin-angiotensin system was modulated by varying of the nutritional sodium load prior to the experiments. Endogenous angiotensin formation was blocked by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Following high sodium intake, both angiotensin II (100 nmol/l) and angiotensin I (1 mumol/l) caused a marked increase of the electrically evoked noradrenaline overflow. After inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme using captopril (350 nmol/l) or ramiprilat (50 nmol/l), angiotensin I (1 mumol/l) did not enhance noradrenaline overflow. This indicates an active cardiac angiotensin conversion, since the sole administration of captopril and ramiprilat did not affect noradrenaline overflow in rats with high sodium intake. Following low sodium intake, neither angiotensin II (100 nmol/l) nor angiotensin I (1 mumol/l) significantly affected noradrenaline overflow. Both captopril and ramiprilat, however, significantly reduced noradrenaline overflow induced by electrical stimulation, suggesting a facilitory action of endogenous angiotensin under these conditions. This concept was substantiated when evaluating the noradrenaline overflow during control stimulations. Following low sodium intake, stimulation evoked noradrenaline overflow was higher as compared to that after nutritional sodium load. The results are in keeping with a sodium-dependent intracardiac formation of angiotensin II which facilitates noradrenaline release from sympathetic nerve terminals. Following low sodium intake, cardiac angiotensin II formation is active, as indicated by the suppression of noradrenaline release by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and the ineffectiveness of exogenous application of angiotensin II.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "174": "1. In view of a recent interesting hypothesis that the vascular renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays an important role in the maintenance of hypertension, we examined the effect of delapril (DP), a newly developed angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), on angiotensin II (Ang II) release from isolated perfused hind legs of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) in comparison with normotensive rats of Wistar-Kyoto strain (WKY). 2. Male SHR and WKY were given DP orally (10 mg/kg per day) for 2 weeks. Isolated hind legs of these rats were perfused with angiotensinogen-free Krebs-Ringer solution, and Ang II released into the perfusate was determined directly by extraction with Sep-Pak C18 cartridges connected to the perfusion system. 3. Delapril produced a sustained antihypertensive action in SHR but not in WKY. The spontaneous release of Ang II in SHR was 112.9 +/- 17.6 pg during the first 30 min of perfusion, which was somewhat greater than that in WKY (96.5 +/- 9.8 pg). An active metabolite of DP, delapril diacid (DPD), when added to the perfusion medium, suppressed the Ang II release in a dose-dependent manner in the two strains. Oral pretreatment of DP for 2 weeks suppressed the Ang II release by 60% in WKY and more pronouncedly by 73% in SHR. 4. These results suggest the presence of a functional RAS in vascular tissues which contributes to the maintenance of vascular tone of SHR, and that ACEI including DP exerts their antihypertensive effect through inhibition of vascular Ang II release in this animal model of human hypertension.", 
    "175": "The adrenal gland of various mammalian species has been shown to contain all the components of a functional renin-angiotensin system. We investigated the existence of this local system in human adrenal tissues surgically obtained. Eight normal adrenals (cortex and medulla) and 6 aldosterone-producing adenomas (aldosteronomas) were examined. Minced tissues were superfused over 270 min, and 15-min fractions were collected. In the perfusates, active renin was measured by immunoradiometric assay with human anti-renin monoclonal antibodies; immunoreactive angiotensin II/III and aldosterone were measured by radioimmunoassay. Adrenal tissues, either normal or pathological, were found concomitantly to release renin, angiotensin II/III and aldosterone. The pattern of this spontaneous release exhibited a pulsatile character. The total amount of renin and angiotensin II/III secreted during superfusion clearly exceeded the tissue content (determined by extraction). Addition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor quinaprilat (4 x 10(-6) mol/l) in the superfusion caused a concomitant decrease of angiotensin II/III and aldosterone secretion by 3 normal tissues, and no change in 2 aldosteronomas. These data provide evidence that the human adrenal gland in vitro generates and releases both renin and angiotensin II/III, and support the hypothesis that locally formed angiotensin II/III may play a role as a paracrine regulator of physiological aldosterone secretion.", 
    "176": "The major differences that have been recognized between black and white hypertensives are primarily epidemiologic, with hypertension being more prevalent, having an earlier onset, and having more severe sequelae in the black population. The cause of the problem in both black and white people remains obscure, but it appears that a difference in sodium handling may contribute to the particular hemodynamic and hormonal profile of black hypertensives. Salt sensitivity, expanded plasma volume and low renin levels have been the hallmark of the black hypertensive. Complications such as stroke and left ventricular hypertrophy remain the major sequelae of this disease in blacks. Finally, a current study confirmed the improved efficacy of antihypertensive therapy in blacks to diuretics and calcium channel blockers and a somewhat lower efficacy profile to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and beta blockers, although the latter classes of agents have shown better response in blacks than previously thought.",

The following five groups of dogs received CAP: (1) Group of untreated dogs, (2) TSA Group in which the dogs were subjected to total spinal anesthesia (TSA), (3) Ang II Group in which the dogs received a continuous intravenous infusion of angiotensin II (Ang II), (4) APR + Ang II Group in which the dogs received a continuous intravenous infusion of Ang II after pretreatment with aprotinin (APR, 25,000 K.I.E.), a kallikrein inhibitor, and (5) IND + APR + Ang II Group in which the dogs received a continuous intravenous infusion of Ang II after pretreatment with indomethacin (IND, 5 mg/kg), a prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor, and APR. 1) CAP significantly decreased TPR and MCP in the untreated Group. 2) CAP significantly decreased TPR and MCP in the TSA Group. There were no significant differences in percentage change of TPR (% delta TPR) and percentage change of MCP (% delta MCP) between the untreated and TSA Groups. 3) In the Ang II Group, CAP decreased the elevated TPR significantly, but hardly affected the elevated MCP. 4) CAP significantly decreased TPR without significant change in MCP in the APR + Ang II Group. The % delta TPR was significantly smaller in this Group than in the Ang II Group. 5) CAP significantly decreased TPR without significant change in MCP in the IND + APR + Ang II Group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "178": "Because most patients with mild to moderate hypertension will not suffer a cardiovascular event due to elevated blood pressure, the presence of other risk factors must be assessed. Many of these are alterable with nondrug therapies, which cost little and carry no risks if applied sensibly. Drug therapies have costs, discomforts, and risks and should be used only for those at high risk or those who fail to respond adequately to nondrug therapies. When drug therapy is necessary, start with low doses and aim for a slow reduction of blood pressure, avoiding hypoperfusion and reducing as many risk factors as possible. Alpha blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and calcium-channel blockers may avoid metabolic risks associated with high-dose diuretic and beta-blocker therapy. The establishment of therapeutic goals, individualized assessment of status, and a conservative approach to treatment are the basis for optimal management of patients with hypertension.", 
    "179": "Captopril has attained widespread use as an effective agent in the treatment of heart failure and hypertension. Dermatological, renal and haematological toxicity associated with its use has been widely described and is usually well recognized. There have been comparatively few reports implicating it as causing hepatic drug reactions. Most descriptions have emphasized strongly cholestatic features, although a mixed hepatocellular cholestatic picture and predominant hepatocellular reactions have been reported. Between November 1972 and June 1990 only five cases of possible Captopril-associated hepatic dysfunction were reported to the Australian Adverse Drug Reaction Advisory Committee. Cases reported suggest equal sex distribution, latent period to development of abnormality between 1 week and 20 months, with slow resolution of jaundice and biochemical abnormality from 1 week to 6 months after withdrawal of the drug. One case of hepatic coma and death with massive acute hepatic necrosis on biopsy has been reported. Not uncommonly the accompanying systemic features suggest a syndrome of drug hypersensitivity. We report a case of Captopril-induced cholestatic jaundice in which the abnormality occurred 2 weeks after commencement of the drug and resolved slowly upon discontinuation. The case illustrates two important points: first, the importance of taking a full history, obtaining detailed information about previous drug administration in patients admitted with jaundice; and second, in the case of Captopril-induced liver disease, the jaundice may persist for many weeks after drug withdrawal.",

Arterial oxygen saturation remained unchanged while haemoglobin concentration and arterial oxygen content were significantly reduced. Total body haemoglobin was significantly reduced but the plasma volume remained unchanged. At rest, the reduction in arterial oxygen content resulted in a significantly reduced mixed venous oxygen content. However, during submaximal exercise the increase in cardiac output fully compensated for the reduction in arterial oxygen content and this effect was indicated by the unaltered mixed venous oxygen content. No changes were found in the placebo group after twelve weeks.",

    "186": "To examine predictors for the efficacy of antihypertensive agents, we investigated the effects of nifedipine and captopril on blood pressure (BP) and humoral factors in patients with essential hypertension. Eleven essential hypertensive patients (mean age: 54) were treated with long acting nifedipine at 20 to 40 mg/day for 8 weeks and 25 essential hypertensives (mean age: 51) were treated with captopril at 37.5 to 75 mg/day. Blood pressure was measured every 2 weeks. Plasma renin activity (PRA), and plasma concentrations of aldosterone, epinephrine and norepinephrine were determined before and at the end of treatment. Both nifedipine and captopril decreased BP (nifedipine: mean BP 119 +/- 3 to 101 +/- 2 mm Hg, captopril: 124 +/- 2 to 100 +/- 2, P less than .01 for each), whereas neither of them affected heart rate. The 8-week treatment of nifedipine showed no significant effect on humoral factors. Captopril increased PRA by 63% (P less than .05) and decreased plasma epinephrine by 42% (P less than .01) and norepinephrine by 35% (P less than .01). The change in mean BP was positively correlated with pretreatment PRA (r = 0.68, P less than .01) in nifedipine-treated patients and inversely with pretreatment norepinephrine (r = -0.53, P less than .01) in captopril treatment. The results suggest that both nifedipine and captopril were effective antihypertensive agents and that the long term treatment of nifedipine is more effective in essential hypertensives with lower PRA, while captopril is more effective in those with higher plasma norepinephrine concentration.", 
    "187": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are well established in the treatment of hypertension and cardiac failure. Experimental studies in rats have suggested that these agents may protect renal function in chronic nephropathy by a mechanism other than simply lowering the systemic blood pressure. In human studies of incipient diabetic nephropathy, worsening of microalbuminuria was prevented during 3 years of ACE inhibition. ACE inhibitors reduce arterial blood pressure in chronic nephropathy, and may cause a fall in glomerular filtration rate. In diabetic nephropathy, proteinuria was reduced by 2 months' treatment with enalapril to less than half of the values obtained in a control group treated with metoprolol. Nonrandomised trials have suggested that ACE inhibitors may slow the deterioration of renal function, but no comparisons with other antihypertensive agents in prospective studies have been published to date. In chronic renal failure, ACE inhibitors may worsen anaemia and hyperkalaemia. Renovascular hypertension can be treated with ACE inhibitors, but the treatment may lead to a compromised renal function. The dosage of these drugs should be reduced in renal failure and therapy should be started cautiously in this setting, with close monitoring of blood pressure, renal function and plasma potassium.", 
    "188": "The effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) on proteinuria, renal function, and serum proteins were evaluated in six children with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome and proteinuria of 3-15 g/24 h (277 +/- 47 mg/m2 per hour). Following ACEI, proteinuria decreased from 7,408 +/- 2,385 (mean +/- SEM) to 3,746 +/- 1,395 mg/24 h (P less than 0.05). Creatinine clearance was 87.8 +/- 22.6 before and 96.4 +/- 23.6 ml/min per 1.73 m2 after ACEI. In two patients, inulin and para-aminohippuric acid clearances were normal before and after ACEI, together with parallel reductions of urine protein of 50% and 46%. Clearance of total protein was reduced by 56% following ACEI, compared with reduction in the clearance of gamma globulin by 58% and albumin by 39.5%. No significant change was seen in blood pressure, serum albumin, or total protein following ACEI. After ACEI, diuretic doses were able to be reduced or eliminated in three patients. Reduction of proteinuria was sustained during a followup period of 11-20 months in three patients. ACEI may be of benefit in the clinical management of children with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndromes, allowing reduction in diuretic requirements.",

After 2 months of treatment, BP reductions were similar after E, 40 mg d-1, and V, 240 mg twice a day. The fall in supine mean BP after 2 months of treatment with V was significantly greater in patients aged greater than or equal to 50 years of age (P = 0.02) (median 18 mmHg) than in patients aged less than 50 years (10 mmHg). E showed similar effectiveness in both age groups. Statistical group analysis of a quality-of-life questionnaire showed no significant differences between the active drugs and the placebo. It is concluded that E and V are equally effective as antihypertensive agents, and that both drugs are well tolerated.", 
    "190": "Impairment of left ventricular (LV) function has previously been reported in patients with systemic sclerosis (SScl). An intermittent vasospastic process in the myocardium may contribute to the development of myocardial dysfunction. Vasodilators may therefore be potentially useful in the treatment of cardiac dysfunction in patients with SScl. This study was designed to evaluate the long-term effects of captopril on the myocardial function of patients with SScl. Twenty-two patients with SScl (15 patients with diffuse scleroderma and 7 patients with CREST syndrome, i.e. calcinosis. Raynaud's phenomenon, oesophageal hypomotility, sclerodactyly, telangiectasia) were investigated by means of Doppler and echophonocardiography before and after treatment with captopril (1.3 mg kg-1 body weight d-1) for 11-15 months. There were no significant differences in heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, end-systolic blood pressure, total peripheral resistance or LV diameters before or after treatment. However, captopril treatment exerted significant effects on LV function: the pre-ejection period (PEP) and the ratio of pre-ejection period to LV ejection time decreased significantly (P less than 0.05). Mitral E-point septal separation decreased significantly (P less than 0.01), even after adjustment for LV end-diastolic diameter (P less than 0.01). The ejection fraction increased significantly (P less than 0.05), and the isovolumic relaxation time decreased (P less than 0.01). The left atrial emptying index increased (P less than 0.01). The Doppler peak late to early ventricular filling velocity decreased (P less than 0.05), and the isovolumic index was also reduced (P less than 0.05). We conclude that both systolic and diastolic LV function indices improved in patients with SScl after captopril treatment for a mean period of 1 year. The effects of captopril might be due to vasodilation of the myocardial vessels and/or a direct effect on the renin-angiotensin system of the heart.", 
    "191": "Vasoactive hormones acting as endocrine, neuroendocrine, or local hormonal systems (intracrine, autocrine, and paracrine) are an important component of the many factors that regulate blood pressure. Hypertension may be the result of an alteration in the balance between vasodepressor and vasopressor hormonal systems. Changes in this balance could be due to genetic factors such as mutations in one of the genes of the vasoactive system or environmental factors that alter the synthesis and release of one or more vasoactive hormones. Endocrine and neuroendocrine vasopressor hormonal systems, such as the renin-angiotensin system and catecholamines, play a well-established and important role in the regulation of blood pressure and the pathogenesis of some secondary forms of hypertension. The blockade of such systems has already resulted in effective antihypertensive treatment. The role of local hormonal systems is less well established; however, recent evidence suggests they also play an important role in the regulation of blood pressure and the pathogenesis of hypertension. Some vasopressor hormonal systems, such as the renin-angiotensin system, can act as both endocrine or local hormonal systems. Work using transgenic rats harboring the mouse Ren-2 gene has conclusively demonstrated that the renin-angiotensin system, acting as a local hormonal system, has the capability to cause severe hypertension. Whether this model of experimental hypertension mimics any type of human hypertension is not known. Vasodepressor hormones such as kinins, prostaglandins, and endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) act mainly as local hormonal systems, with the notable exception of atrial natriuretic factor, which may act as both an endocrine and a local hormone. The tissue kallikrein-kinin system, acting either directly or via paracrine eicosanoids or EDRF, participates in local regulation of the circulation, renal function, and the acute antihypertensive effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. A restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) that distinguishes the kallikrein gene family of a strain of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) from normotensive Brown Norway rats has been identified. In a set of 32 recombinant inbred strains derived from these SHR and Brown Norway strains, the RFLP marking the kallikrein gene family of SHR cosegregated with an increase in blood pressure. Also, in a study of Utah families it was found that a dominant-allele kallikrein gene expressed as high urinary kallikrein excretion was associated with a decreased risk of essential hypertension. In conclusion, vasopressor and vasodepressor hormones, acting not only as endocrine but also as local hormones, play an important role in the regulation of blood pressure and the pathogenesis of hypertension.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "192": "Radioisotopic renal scanning after angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition (ACEI) has proven to be an exciting area for research. The biologic activity of markers such as DTPA and hippuran, when combined with the physiological effects of ACEI, may provide noninvasive methods of diagnosing both renal artery stenosis and renovascular hypertension. Recent investigators have demonstrated that the sensitivities and specificities of these tests may vary widely; these differences are probably due to variations in study design, patient population, diagnostic criteria, and outcome measurements. We have reviewed these studies and discuss these possible sources of variation and their impact on the clinical usefulness of these diagnostic tests, especially in relation to the prevalence of disease in the population. Current results suggest that the post-ACEI DTPA scan is relatively accurate in the diagnosis of renal artery stenosis, with sensitivity generally greater than 90% and specificity around 95%. However, the best results in predicting the response to angioplasty or surgery in patients with renal artery stenosis have been with the use of post-ACEI hippuran in combination with furosemide (sensitivity, 96%; specificity, 95%). With confirmation of these findings and continued investigation, it is expected that accurate noninvasive tests will be available for widespread clinical use in the near future.", 
    "193": "To improve the diagnosis and forecast the response to surgery or renal angioplasty in patients with hypertension and renal artery stenosis, we employed a simplified captopril renography protocol in conjunction with renal arteriography in 94 clinically selected patients. Fifty hypertensive patients (group 1) with a high clinical likelihood of renovascular hypertension were evaluated using a simplified captopril renography protocol and renal angiography on the arterial side. Criteria for normal captopril renal scintigrams were established based on this original cohort and validated in an additional 44 clinically comparable patients (group 2). Renal revascularization or nephrectomy was performed in 39 patients, and success of the procedure was determined in the 34 patients for whom 3-month follow-up was available. In the 94 patients, 44 (47%) had renal artery stenosis. Simplified captopril renography was 91% sensitive and 94% specific in identifying or excluding renal artery stenosis in the combined group, with no difference in the diagnostic utility between groups 1 and 2, or in those with renal insufficiency (n = 38) or those with bilateral disease (n = 17). Scintigraphic abnormalities induced by captopril were strongly associated with cure or improvement in blood pressure control following revascularization or nephrectomy (15 of 18), while the lack of captopril-induced changes was associated with failure of such intervention (13 of 16) (p = 0.0004). We conclude that simplified captopril renography is highly sensitive and specific in the diagnosis of renal artery stenosis in a clinically selected high-risk population and that the test accurately predicts the success or failure of therapeutic intervention.", 
    "194": "The present study examines the effects of prolonged angiotensin II antagonism in spontaneously hypertensive rats by using an angiotensin II receptor antagonist (DuP 753) that is devoid of agonistic properties and selective for the subtype 1 of the angiotensin II (AT1) receptor. The antihypertensive effects of DuP 753 and its effects on circulating parameters of the renin-angiotensin system were compared with those of a converting enzyme inhibitor (benazeprilat). To minimize any influence of differences in the pharmacokinetic properties of the two blockers, administration was by continuous intravenous infusion. The experiments were performed in conscious, freely moving rats with continuous 24-hour monitoring of blood pressure. DuP 753 (10 or 30 mg/kg/day) lowered mean arterial pressure to the same extent as benazeprilat (3 or 10 mg/kg/day) during a 48-hour period. The antihypertensive effect was sustained when the treatment was extended to 7 days (DuP 753, 10 mg/kg/day; benazeprilat, 3 mg/kg/day). Neither of the compounds affected the baseline or diurnal rhythm of heart rate. Plasma concentrations of renin and angiotensin II were increased sevenfold and 10-fold, respectively, in the rats treated with DuP 753. In rats treated with benazeprilat, plasma renin concentration increased threefold, whereas angiotensin II was unchanged. Heart weights were significantly reduced to a similar extent by DuP 753 and benazeprilat. Both compounds also induced a smaller but significant decrease in blood pressure in Wistar-Kyoto rats. Our results indicate that the antihypertensive effects of converting enzyme inhibitors in spontaneously hypertensive rats are mainly due to the blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. In this rat model, angiotensin II appears to play an important role in the maintenance of hypertension that is mediated via the AT1 receptor.", 
    "195": "Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system by an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin II (Ang II) antagonist is accompanied by a reactive rise in renin release. This rise is generally attributed to interruption of the short feedback loop between Ang II and renin release. Similarly, after the administration of a renin inhibitor, the plasma concentrations of active and total renin are increased and plasma renin activity is suppressed. The aim of the present study was to investigate if a fall in the plasma Ang II level is the unique determinant of the rise in the active renin (AR) level that follows renin inhibition. Six normal male volunteers participated in three successive 240-minute experiments at weekly intervals according to a single-blind randomized Latin square design. For experiment 1, Ang II was infused at 2 ng/kg/min from 0 to 60 minutes and at 4 ng/kg/min from 60 to 120 minutes. For experiment 2, 0.3 mg/kg of the new potent renin inhibitor Ro 42-5892 was injected at 30 minutes followed by infusion at 0.1 mg/kg/hr from 30 to 240 minutes. For experiment 3, Ang II and Ro 42-5892 were administered simultaneously at the same doses as described above. The mean +/- SEM Ang II concentration increased from 10.2 +/- 1.6 to 33.7 +/- 11.2 pg/ml after infusion of exogenous peptide. It decreased from 9.5 +/- 0.9 to 1.4 +/- 0.3 pg/ml after the injection of Ro 42-5892 and increased from 15.6 +/- 2.9 to 37.1 +/- 11.8 pg/ml after the simultaneous infusion of both compounds.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Two hundred forty-two patients were randomized. Dose titration was completed by week 4 after randomization, and the maintenance phase was completed at week 16. Diltiazem (sustained release) demonstrated greater diastolic blood pressure lowering at both weeks 8 and 16 by an intent-to-treat analysis. At week 16, diltiazem changed diastolic blood pressure -13.7 +/- 0.7 mm Hg compared with -10.8 +/- 1.1 mm Hg for atenolol, and -10.5 +/- 0.9 mm Hg for enalapril. Diltiazem also demonstrated greater lowering of systolic blood pressure at week 3, but these differences in systolic blood pressure had decreased by week 16. More patients were classified as treatment failures during the 16 weeks of the trial for atenolol (15%) than for diltiazem (2.5%), while the treatment failure rate was intermediate with enalapril (8%). Total rates of adverse events were equivalent across the three treatment arms. There were few significant differences in the impact of the three treatments on mean scores of quality-of-life measures at week 16. There was a trend for atenolol to have somewhat worse quality-of-life scores, but none of these differences were statistically significant. In conclusion, all three treatment regimens were effective in lowering diastolic blood pressure without significant differences in rates of adverse events or deleterious effects on quality of life.", 
    "197": "We studied iatrogenic problems in nephrology by classifying all patients for nephrology consultation into nine presenting syndromes and seven etiologic groups. One hundred (2.2%) of all admissions were seen in nephrology consultation. Acute renal failure was the most common presenting syndrome, accounting for 59% of the consultations. Forty-one of the 100 consultations (1% of all admissions) had a renewal syndrome of iatrogenic origin. Of these 41 patients, 38 had acute renal failure and three had fluid and electrolyte problems. Twenty of the 41 patients had drug-induced problems. Eighteen of these patients were dehydrated, and in three patients, acute renal failure occurred after surgery. Of the 20 patients with iatrogenic renal problems caused by drugs, seven problems were antibiotic related, five were due to diuretics, four were due to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, three were due to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and one was from the use of contrast medium. The 41 patients with iatrogenic-related renal disease were older than the other 59 patients (61.8 vs 49.3 years). Iatrogenic renal disease developed in 1% of all patients admitted to a tertiary care hospital, and 12% of these patients died. The most common renal syndrome is acute renal failure, most often caused by nephrotoxic drugs. The incidence can probably be decreased by better monitoring of body weight and fluid balance to prevent dehydration and by the avoidance of nephrotoxic drugs.", 
    "198": "The contribution of the paraventricular nucleus region of the hypothalamus (PVN) to the maintenance of one-kidney, figure-8 renal wrap hypertension was determined in this study. Electrolytic ablation of the PVN was performed 4 wk after the production of hypertension or sham operation. Ablation of the PVN region significantly reduced mean arterial pressure (MAP) from 150 +/- 9 to 110 +/- 3 mmHg in the hypertensive rats. In the sham-hypertensive group, the lesion decreased MAP from 118 +/- 2 to 99 +/- 4 mmHg. In both groups of animals MAP from 118 +/- 2 to 99 +/- 4 mmHg. In both groups of animals MAP returned to prelesion values by day 7 postlesion. When ganglionic blockade was performed on day 7 postlesion, the fall in MAP was greater in hypertensive rats (-44 +/- 5 mmHg) than in normotensive rats (-26 +/- 3 mmHg). In a separate group of rats studied 3 days after PVN ablation, ganglionic blockade produced similar decreases in MAP in the wrapped and sham-operated animals. These studies suggest that the PVN contributes to the increased functional sympathetic nervous system associated with one-kidney, figure-8 renal hypertension. Although ablation of the PVN region decreases MAP, neural mechanisms compensate to return MAP to hypertensive levels.",

H-ESRD increased from 6.4 to 9.6 per 100,000 in blacks and from 0.36 to 0.62 per 100,000 in whites. Smoothed age- and race-specific yearly H-ESRD rates decreased in blacks under age 50. Peak incidence of H-ESRD shifted from age 40 to 49 in 1974 through 1978 to age 50 to 59 in 1982 through 1987 (P less than 0.0001). Blacks were referred for care with significantly higher blood pressure levels and serum creatinine concentrations than whites, and had more severe retinal vascular disease. Factors significantly associated with a shorter time from referral to renal replacement therapy were black race, female gender, blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine concentrations, carbohydrate intolerance, and the use of alpha-agonist and/or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. We conclude that racial distribution and risk for H-ESRD have not changed. Peak rates of H-ESRD have been delayed nearly a decade, suggesting a possible effect of better awareness and treatment of hypertension.", 
    "200": "In this review, the relationship between hypertension and abnormal carbohydrate metabolism is explored. A review of the current literature reveals that people with hypertension are also likely to suffer from insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, and hyperinsulinemia. Likewise, hypertension is prevalent in obese and diabetic patients. Deficiency of insulin at the cellular level may be a common mechanism in the development of hypertension in patients with type I or type II diabetes mellitus. Essential hypertension appears to be an insulin-resistant state. Insulin resistance may engender hypertension by increasing peripheral vascular resistance as well as by increasing salt retention at the level of the kidney. Therefore effective antihypertensive therapy should include agents that do not adversely affect carbohydrate metabolic abnormalities. Commonly used antihypertensive agents, such as thiazide, thiazide-like diuretics, and beta-blockers, are associated with glucose intolerance and increased insulin resistance. In contrast, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium antagonists, and peripheral alpha-blockers (such as prazosin and terazosin) do not adversely affect glucose tolerance or insulin sensitivity. In addition, alpha-blockers have a positive effect on the serum lipid profile. The entire multifactorial cardiac risk profile must be considered when choosing therapeutic agents for conditions that have an impact on cardiovascular disease.",

    "203": "Ramipril is a new, potent nonsulfhydryl inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme. The magnitude and duration of its antihypertensive effect were evaluated in a multicenter, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial conducted in 100 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. Ramipril significantly reduced both supine and standing blood pressures measured 24 h after dosing. Automated blood pressure monitoring showed that ramipril significantly reduced systolic and diastolic pressures for 24 h after dosing. The peak effect occurred between 3 and 6 h after dosing, with approximately 50% of this effect retained after 24 h. Ramipril was well tolerated; there was no significant difference between active drug and placebo in the overall incidence of side effects. Ramipril is an effective and well-tolerated antihypertensive agent, which reduces both supine and standing blood pressure over the entire 24-h period after dosing.", 
    "204": "To investigate whether reduction in blood pressure has a beneficial effect on left ventricular diastolic function, we investigated 20 hypertensive patients with evidence of diastolic dysfunction at baseline and at 3 and 6 months after initiation of captopril therapy. Two-dimensional echocardiography was used to determine left ventricular mass index and Doppler ultrasound to assess diastolic function. Fifteen of the 20 patients had a significant reduction in blood pressure at 3 and 6 months and left ventricular mass index remained unchanged during the study period. Despite reduction in blood pressure, no difference in isovolumic relaxation time, early and atrial filling velocities or their ratio was observed. Our results suggest that a direct relationship between blood pressure and left ventricular diastolic function does not exist and that other factors such as alterations in muscle or collagen composition of the left ventricle may be more important in determining abnormal diastolic function in hypertension.", 
    "205": "Natriuresis induced by extracellular volume expansion (ECVE) is accompanied by a decrease in renin release and by an increase of renal interstitial hydrostatic pressure (RIHP). This study was undertaken to examine, in anesthetized dogs, the relative role of intrarenal angiotensin II (ANG II) changes in mediating natriuresis, diuresis, and increases in RIHP induced by two different levels of volume expansion (1.5 and 5% body wt in 45 min) with isotonic saline. Intrarenal ANG II levels were maintained in the right kidney throughout the experiment by simultaneously infusing captopril (0.8 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) and ANG II (1 ng.kg-1.min-1) into the right renal artery. In response to 5% ECVE, increases in RIHP, natriuresis, and diuresis were inhibited in the right kidney by 55, 40, and 47% respectively, when compared with the left kidney. Significant increases occurred in plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) levels during 5% ECVE. Maintenance of constant intrarenal ANG II levels during 1.5% ECVE completely abolished the increment of RIHP and diuresis and inhibited the natriuretic response by 80% in the right kidney when compared with the left kidney. Plasma ANP levels did not change during the 1.5% ECVE. No differences between kidneys were found when the intrarenal effects of ANG II were blocked with saralasin before saline loading. These results suggest that increases in RIHP, natriuresis, and diuresis during ECVE are partially mediated by decreases in intrarenal ANG II levels. Furthermore, these results indicate that the role of intrarenal ANG II levels in mediating the renal response to ECVE is more important when plasma ANP levels do not change than when they are increased.", 
    "206": "The contribution of neurogenic mechanisms in maintaining hypertension was investigated in 13 patients with unilateral renal artery stenosis (twelve with normal, one with grossly elevated plasma renin levels) by determining the haemodynamic and hormonal responses to the centrally acting sympatholytic agent, clonidine. The same patients were studied after captopril to determine the dependency of their blood pressure on the direct peripheral effects of angiotensin-II. Sixteen patients with essential hypertension (normal plasma renin) were additionally studied after clonidine. After clonidine, blood pressure fell markedly in patients with renal artery stenosis (17 +/- 3%) and essential hypertension (18 +/- 2%). In both groups, clonidine lowered cardiac output by a reduction in stroke volume and heart rate; forearm vascular resistance was unchanged but digital skin vascular resistance fell. Plasma noradrenaline levels were normal in both groups and fell after clonidine; plasma renin activity and aldosterone levels were unchanged. After captopril, blood pressure fell minimally (5 +/- 3%) in renal artery stenosis patients; cardiac output fell and forearm and digital skin vascular resistance were unchanged. Plasma renin activity rose, plasma aldosterone fell and plasma noradrenaline was unchanged after captopril. In the patient with grossly elevated renin levels, blood pressure fell minimally (6%) after clonidine, but unlike others fell profoundly (37%) after captopril. We conclude that, in the majority of our renal artery stenosis patients, despite the elevated blood pressure, sympathetic nervous activity was not reduced. Central neurogenic mechanisms appear to play an important role in maintaining raised blood pressure. In the same patients the peripheral effects of angiotensin-II did not maintain vascular tone or hypertension.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "207": "Systemic vasoconstriction is a hallmark in chronic heart failure and due to several compensatory mechanisms such as neural, humoral and local vascular factors. Peripheral vasoconstriction mediated by increased sympathetic tone and activated plasma renin-angiotensin system (RAS) may act primarily for short-term control. The effects of the vascular RAS, impaired endothelium-mediated dilation (possibly due to chronically reduced flow) and structural alterations of the vessel wall slowly emerge over time. In addition, fluid and sodium retention may contribute to increase vascular stiffness in chronic heart failure. Improved cardiac output with acute administration of vasodilators and inotropic agents appears to exert redistribution of blood flow without improving blood flow to working muscle during exercise. Even if such agents do improve blood flow to the exercising skeletal muscle with short-term administration, oxygen utilization of the skeletal muscle is not immediately increased because intrinsic abnormalities of skeletal muscle exist in chronic heart failure; e.g. due to chronic deconditioning, resulting in reduced oxidative capacity of skeletal muscle as suggested by ultrastructural analysis and NMR-spectroscopy. The reversal of the above delineated peripheral alterations develop slowly over time. Chronically increased flow may improve impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation of the vessel wall and the oxidative capacity may increase, in part, due to a training effect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "208": "Progression of heart failure (\"expected mortality\") and sudden cardiac death (\"unexpected mortality\"), presumably secondary to ventricular arrhythmia, are the major causes for the poor prognosis in chronic heart failure (CHF). Limitations of this classification ultimately stem from inaccuracies in establishing the mechanism of death at the time of death. Elucidation of the determinants of patients prone to sudden death and the effects of treatment modalities on the rate of sudden death remain hidden. Unexpected mortality is probably secondary to arrhythmic death but denotes only that death occurred within some brief interval (arbitrarily less than one hour in most studies) and does not exclude other causes. The demonstrated benefit of ACE inhibitors for improving total mortality as illustrated by the findings of the VHeFT, Captopril Multicenter and CONSENSUS, and the improved event-free survival shown by Munich Mild Heart Failure Trial for low-dose captopril argues strongly for their use in patients with CHF. These agents are confirmed to reduce the risk of death from pump failure; the effects on sudden death are less clear. Although many favorable effects contribute to improved hemodynamics, neuroendocrine and electrolyte status as discussed, at present, it is not possible to predict the precise mechanism by which these agents extend life and whether they reduce the frequency of \"sudden\" deaths.", 
    "209": "Vasodilators have been shown to improve hemodynamics of the failing heart as a short-term effect and to decrease mortality as a long-term result. We therefore studied the effect of different vasodilators on myocardial mechanics and energetics in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC) NYHA II to III. In these patients undergoing routine heart catheterization myocardial oxygen consumption was measured using the argon method, and left ventricular pressure and geometry were obtained from left ventricular angiography using a Millar tip microcatheter. All data were analyzed for one single heart beat. The best correlation was found between MVO2/beat and the systolic stress-time integral which considers left ventricular pressure, wall thickness, and geometry. The relation between MVO2/beat and peak systolic wall stress was less relevant. No correlation was found between MVO2/beat and pressure-volume work, dP/dtmax, and mean velocity of circumferential fiber shortening. The intravenous application of nitroprusside and the ACE-inhibitor benazepril decreased both the systolic stress-time integral and the myocardial oxygen consumption in proportion to each other indicating unchanged economy of myocardial contraction. In contrast to other vasodilators, beta 1-agonists and phosphodiesterase inhibitors increase myocardial oxygen consumption independently of changes in the stress-time integral. In conclusion, vasodilators decrease left ventricular pressure and chamber size and thereby proportionally reduce MVO2/beat. The reduction of energy needed for myocardial contraction may partially explain the long-term effects of the ACE-inhibitors and combinations of vasodilators. Pure positive inotropic substances, especially beta 1-agonists, increase myocardial oxygen consumption with minor changes of systolic stress-time integral.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "210": "The Munich Mild Heart Failure Trial (MHFT) investigated the influences of ACE-inhibition on progression of congestive heart failure (CHF). Major end points were progression of CHF from New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classes I to III to NYHA functional class IV despite optimal adjusted standard therapy and death due to congestive heart failure, i.e. death due to pump failure or sudden death. 170 patients were randomly assigned to treatment with either captopril (n = 83) 25 mg b.i.d. or placebo in addition to standard therapy for a median observation period of 2.7 years. The major result of this trial was the decrease in the relative risk for progressive heart failure by captopril therapy to 34% (95% confidence interval 17 to 68%; p = 0.01). Though total mortality was not reduced, death due to pump failure was found considerably less often on captopril than on placebo (18.2 vs 50% of total deaths in each group). In addition this report describes influences of captopril therapy on left ventricular size and function, heart size on X-ray, influences on symptomatology, electrolytes, ventricular arrhythmias, on concomitant therapy as well as effects in various subgroups. The major finding of the trial--the influence on progression of CHF--was independent of the underlying cardiac disease and was consistent in subgroups with different etiology of heart failure. Captopril blunted the increase in norepinephrine levels usually seen with increasing severity of congestive heart failure. There was a significant increase in serum sodium and potassium levels in the captopril treated group. Left ventricular size and function were well preserved in the patients still on randomized therapy after two years. No effects of therapy on ventricular ectopic activity were found in a subgroup of 93 patients that had had Holter monitoring.", 
    "211": "Captopril has marked effects on progression of disease and reduces the likelihood of progressive heart failure in patients with mild symptoms. Several indices of unfavourable prognosis are either improved (sodium, norepinephrine, angiotensin II) or stabilized (left ventricular function). Thus ACE-inhibitors are to be considered for all patients requiring medical therapy for congestive heart failure.", 
    "212": "Early treatment of patients with myocardial infarction and left ventricular dysfunction was performed in 90 patients aiming at influencing left ventricular remodelling. After twelve months of treatment with 25 mg captopril t.i.d. left ventricular ejection fraction was improved by 10% in comparison to a treatment with 40 mg of frusemide or placebo (p = 0.001). Late treatment of the patients not treated with captopril resulted in partial reversal of left ventricular dilatation, while withdrawal of captopril therapy in stable patients with ejection fractions over 30% and without clinical signs of congestive heart failure did not result in deterioration of left ventricular function. These results give a sound rationale for the earlier use of ACE-inhibitors in the treatment of congestive heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction.", 
    "213": "V-HeFT, the first mortality trial in patients with heart failure, has provided important insights regarding trial design, including patient selection and efficacy criteria. Planning of V-HeFT II, the trial comparing hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate and enalapril, has raised additional issues regarding the power to detect mortality effects and the relative value of non-mortality endpoints for efficacy. V-HeFT has demonstrated that some vasodilator regimens can prolong life in heart failure. Hydralazine + isosorbide dinitrate reduced mortality by 27% compared to placebo in patients treated with digoxin and diuretics. The possibility of a non-vasodilator mechanism for long-term benefit of these interventions is raised by the apparently poor relationship between the magnitude of vasodilation and the favorable long-term effects. These issues need to be explored in subsequent trials. In future long-term trials, however, the need for background therapy with drugs that have been effective in reducing mortality will make the identification of life prolongation from new therapies more difficult to demonstrate.", 
    "214": "In an attempt to evaluate the influence of hypertension and antihypertensive agents on IgAN, IgAN and hypertension experimental models were induced in SD rats and divided into 4 groups: (1) IgAN(n = 8); (2) IgAN+by hypertension(n = 8); (3) captopril 4mg/100gBW/d, for 42 days administered to rats as group (2) (n = 8); (4) nifedipine 300ug/100gBW/d, for 42 days administered to rats as group (2) (n = 8). Blood pressure was measured at the 12th, 14th, 16th, 18th and 20th week. Urinary protein, serum angiotensin II (AT II) and renal pathologic changes were examined at the 20th week. Our results suggest that hypertension worsens IgAN by glomerular mesangial proliferation in early stages. Though Captopril has the same therapeutic effect on hypertension as Nifedipine does, the former has been proven to have potentially beneficial effects on diminishing proteinuria as well as mesangial lesions. This is consistent with the suppression of serum ATII which favours glomerular microcirculation.", 
    "215": "Two angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, quinapril and enalapril, were evaluated for comfort, safety, and efficacy in the treatment of mild-to-moderate hypertension. After a four-week placebo period, 53 hypertensive outpatients (diastolic blood pressure, 95 to 115 mmHg), aged 31 to 66 years, were randomly assigned to received 10 to 20 mg of quinapril or enalapril daily for 12 weeks. Two hours after the first dose of each drug, sitting and standing systolic and diastolic blood pressures were reduced significantly from baseline values; these reductions were maintained for the 12 weeks of treatment, with no significant between-group differences. No changes in heart rate were noted. Treatment was discontinued in three quinapril-treated patients and in one enalapril-treated patient because of treatment side effects. It is concluded that both quinapril and enalapril are safe and effective in the treatment of mild-to-moderate hypertension.", 
    "216": "Individual maternal and fetal flows to 706 placental cotyledons obtained from 9 chronically catheterized pregnant ewes and their fetuses (gestation age 123-141 days) were measured. The larger the cotyledon the greater the maternal and fetal blood flow to it. Both fetal and maternal flows to larger cotyledons, however, tended to be lower when corrected for the weight of the cotyledon perfused. Changes in fetal placental flow (dfgc, ml/min/g) occurring within 15 min of administration of 15 mg i.v. of captopril to the ewe were dependent on changes in fetal placental vascular resistance (dcotfr) and maternal flow (dmgc) according to the equation dfgc = 0.123 + 0.185 dmgc - 0.026 dcotfr. Changes in maternal placental flow occurring within 15 min of administration of 15 mg i.v. of captopril to the ewe were dependent on changes in maternal placental vascular resistance (dcotmr) and changes in fetal flow according to the equation dmgc = 0.483 + 0.496 dfgc - 0.0198 dcotmr. The changes in fetal flow over the next 1.5h of treatment with captopril at 6 mg/h were dependent on neither changes in fetal placental vascular resistance nor maternal placental flow. changes in maternal placental flows over the same time were no longer related to changes in fetal flow and depended only to a minimal extent on changes in maternal placental resistance. These analyses suggest that treatment of the pregnant ewe with captopril may have disturbed the normal relationships between maternal and fetal placental circulations.", 
    "217": "The effects of benazepril hydrochloride (CGS 14824 A, CAS 86541-74-4), a novel angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor, on cardiovascular, visceral and renal functions and on hemodynamics, were studied in various experimental animals. Even at a high dose of 100 mg/kg p.o. benazepirl hydrochloride had no influence on the respiration, heart rate and ECG of normotensive anesthetized cats and, except at higher doses, had little effect on the contractile tension of mammalian isolated atrium, ileum, trachea, stomach fundus strips, vas deferens or uterus. Benazepril hydrochloride even at a high dose of 100 mg/kg p.o. had little effect on spontaneous uterine motility, charcoal transportation and gastrointestinal tract motility. In addition, it did not cause gastric irritation, alter the secretion of gastric and biliary juices, and did not affect the tension of the nictitating membrane or the twitch tension of the gastrocnemius muscle in various experimental animals. Benazepril hydrochloride had no effect on the blood glucose and cholesterol levels in alloxan-induced diabetic rats but decreased the triglyceride and total cholesterol levels in normotensive rats at a dose of 30 mg/kg p.o. Benazepril hydrochloride at 3 mg/kg.day s.c. for 10 weeks caused a significant decrease in aortic atherosclerosis without reducing hypercholesterolemia in cholesterol-fed rabbits. Benazepril hydrochloride at a high dose of 100 mg/kg p.o. showed no effect on the urine volume and urinary excretion of electrolytes but decreased PSP excretion in normotensive rats. At a dose of 3 or 10 mg/kg.day p.o. for 4 weeks benazepril hydrochloride inhibited the increase in the excretion of urinary protein in DOCA/salt spontaneously hypertensive rats. It caused hemolysis at concentrations as high as 0.1-1% in rabbits, however, even at a high dose of 100 mg/kg p.o. it did not affect red blood cell fragility in rats, and, except at a high dose of 10(-4) g/ml, showed little effect on the platelet aggregation response induced by collagen or arachidonic acid in rabbits. From these results, benazepril hydrochloride is considered to be a safe and well-tolerated addition to the therapeutic armamentarium of cardiovascular drugs.", 
    "218": "Pretreatment with captopril, a kininase II inhibitor, at 10 mg/kg i.p. or s.c., significantly increased the writhing response induced by a minimum effective dose (0.75 mg/kg i.p.) of phenylbenzoquinone (PBQ), by 91-148%. 1,10-Phenanthroline, a carboxypeptidase B inhibitor (2 mg/kg i.p.), in combination with captopril enhanced the algesic effect of PBQ by 309-360%. Captopril also doubled the number of writhes induced by a minimum effective dose of BK (5 micrograms/kg i.p.) in PGE2-pretreated mice. The writhing responses induced by higher doses of PBQ or BK were not affected by these inhibitors. The hyperalgesic effect of BK (1 micrograms) injected into the hindpaw of rats was significantly increased and prolonged by coinjection of captopril (30 micrograms) and 1,10-phenanthroline (30 micrograms) and was prevented by carboxypeptidase B (1 mg). These data indicate that BK plays a role in pain in these models, a role which appears of greatest relevance at threshold algesic stimulation.", 
    "219": "The extravasation of plasma proteins and formation of interendothelial gaps in submucosal microvessels by mucosally-applied bradykinin (BK), were studied in the rat trachea. The effects of topical and systemic (s.c.) glucocorticoid budesonide (BUD) were investigated in the presence or absence of inhibitors of BK-degradtive enzymes (captopril and thiorphan 10 microM to inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and neutral endopeptidase (NEP), respectively). Inhibition of these enzymes markedly increased the inflammatory responses to BK. Topical BUD (3 microM, 10 min contact, 90 min before BK) significantly decreased the volume of plasma in the tracheal lumen, both in the absence and presence of the enzyme inhibitors. Thus, the main anti-transudation mechanism of topical BUD is not related to modulation of BK-breakdown. However, this may be the mechanism for systemic BUD. Neither topical nor systemic BUD prevented interendothelial gap formation.", 
    "220": "We prospectively studied 69 consecutive patients hospitalized with a primary diagnosis of acute left ventricular failure so as to assess the impact of vasodilators on incidence and morbidity of acute symptomatic left ventricular failure. The determinants of duration of hospitalization, in-hospital mortality and symptomatic status 2 months after discharge were examined. There were 9 in-hospital deaths (13%), and survival at 60 days was 77%. Median duration of hospitalization was 9 days, and 33% of the surviving patients remained in New York Heart Association functional class III-IV 60 days subsequent to discharge. Of the patients, 49 (76%) had previously received treatment for left ventricular failure: 30 (61%) of these had received vasodilators, most commonly angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and nitrates. Ischaemic chest pain was present in 34 (49%) of the patients. Acute utilization of vasodilators (45% of patients) was largely limited to nitrate therapy associated with ischaemic chest pain (P less than 0.01). Multiple logistic regression revealed previous left ventricular failure, advanced age and hypokalaemia as significant correlates of prolonged hospitalization (greater than 9 days). Previous left ventricular failure was also predictive of persistent severe disability two months subsequent to discharge. No factor was a significant predictor of in-hospital death. Although preceding treatment with digoxin and incremental angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor therapy tended to predict brief hospitalization, the parameter of acute ischaemia, other biochemical anomalies and modes of acute or chronic therapy were not significant correlates of any end point. We conclude that preceding disability, rather than mode of treatment, predicts an adverse outcome in acute left ventricular failure.",

Renal and intestinal methyltransferase activities were 3 and 8 times lower, respectively, than hepatic activity. 3. The kinetics of methyltransferase with captopril as substrate were studied in four specimens of liver, kidney and intestine.

    "222": "Renal functional reserve (renal response to protein loading, RFR) has been suggested as a method to verify the presence of hyperfiltration. This study was designed to evaluate the role of RFR as an indicator of increased glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure in short-term treated and untreated rats with two-kidney, one-clip Goldblatt hypertension. One month after placing a silver clip, micropuncture studies were performed on the unclipped kidney. Normal rats and three groups of clipped rats [untreated group (HYP), a group treated with captopril (CEI) and a group treated with verapamil (VER) 5 days before the micropuncture studies] were studied. Glomerular hemodynamics and proximal tubular reabsorption were measured in control period and during intravenous administration of glycine (G). In normal rats, G produced afferent and efferent dilation, increases in single nephron plasma flow (SNPF) and single nephron glomerular filtration rate (SNGFR) of 24%. Systemic hypertension in HYP rats was associated with increases in transcapillary pressure gradient (delta P) and SNGFR. In this hyperfiltration state, infusion of G did not modify SNGFR of SNPF defining loss of RFR. The antihypertensive treatment was equally effective in normalizing MAP and delta P in CEI and VER, but only CEI rats responded to G with a 20% increase in SNGFR due to an increase in delta P. The most striking findings were that loss of RFR in both HYP and VER rats was associated with a significant decrease in absolute and proximal fractional reabsorption.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "223": "1. A series of experiments was performed in conscious, unrestrained, male, Long Evans rats, chronically instrumented for the measurement of regional haemodynamics. 2. Infusion of glyceryl trinitrate (GTN, 0.1 mg kg-1 min-1, i.v.) for 10 min elicited tachycardia, but no sustained change in mean arterial blood pressure. Renal haemodynamics were unaffected, but there were reductions in hindquarters flow and vascular conductance together with substantial increases in flow and conductance in the mesenteric vascular bed. 3. In the presence of captopril (2 mg kg-1 bolus, and 1 mg kg-1 h-1 infusion, i.v.) GTN elicited significant hypotension and increases in renal blood flow and vascular conductance, indicating that activation of the renin-angiotension system opposed the dilator effects of GTN in this vascular bed. However, the mesenteric and hindquarters haemodynamic effects of GTN were not affected by captopril. In contrast, in the presence of enalaprilat (2 mg kg-1 bolus, and 1 mg kg-1 h-1 infusion, i.v.) there was significant enhancement of the mesenteric, as well as renal, haemodynamic effects of GTN. Hence, these results provide no evidence for the sulphydryl groups in captopril exerting a specific effect to enhance the haemodynamic actions of GTN in our experimental protocols. 4. Administration of molsidomine alone (1 mg kg-1, i.v. bolus) elicited tachycardia and hypotension; there were no changes in mesenteric or hindquarters haemodynamics, but renal flow and vascular conductance fell. Thus, the hypotensive effect of molsidomine was probably due to a reduction in cardiac output, consequent upon venodilatation. 5. In the presence of captopril or enalaprilat, molsidomine evoked renal and mesenteric vasodilatations in association with hypotension, indicating that activation of the renin-angiotensin system contributed to the lack of vasodilator responses to administration of molsidomine alone. However, since the effects of enalaprilat were more marked than those of captopril (in spite of the dose of both drugs being supramaximal for inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme), other factors must have been involved. 6. In a separate experiment, pretreatment with the nitric oxide synthesis inhibitor, N0-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (1 mg kg- 1 h-1, i.v.), enhanced the mesenteric vasodilator effect of molsidomine. Collectively, these results are consistent with in vitro data showing that endogenous nitric oxide can inhibit the vasodilator effects of nitric oxide derived from molsidomine, and that the sulphydryl groups of captopril can protect endogenous nitric oxide from inactivation by oxygen-derived free radicals, thereby enhancing the inhibitory effect of endogenous nitric oxide on the vasodilator responses to exogenous nitric oxide derived from molsidomine (or GTN).", 
    "224": "1. The importance of total dose to the initial hypotensive response with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (quinapril) was assessed using a suggested 'maintenance' dose (20 mg) or matched placebo in a randomised double-blind study in patients with uncomplicated hypertension. 2. Thirty-two patients were recruited who were not on therapy or had not received diuretic therapy in their existing drug treatment in the preceding 4 weeks. Secondary causes of hypertension had previously been excluded and sustained clinic blood pressures of SBP greater than 160 mmHg and/or DBP greater than 90 mmHg were taken as indications for a trial of adjuvant or monotherapy with an ACE inhibitor. 3. After uneventful supervised therapy with quinapril in an open pilot study (n = 5) 27 patients entered a double-blind, randomised, crossover study of quinapril or placebo using ambulatory monitoring to assess BP response. 4. All patients remained asymptomatic and both therapy and monitoring were well tolerated. A smooth onset of antihypertensive effect was noted with an overall 24 h placebo corrected fall in systolic BP of 9.9 mmHg (7.2-12.6 95% CI) and diastolic BP of 6.4 mmHg (4.2-8.8) with no significant effect on heart rate. Individual placebo corrected maximal responses during the first 8 h following quinapril showed a wide range for both systolic (+1.56 to 44.0 mmHg) and diastolic (+2.3 to -35.6 mmHg) pressure.

    "225": "1. Measures of memory, information processing ability, mood states and trait anxiety were estimated in a double-blind, double-dummy, randomised cross-over trial which compared the effects of atenolol (50 or 100 mg once daily) and captopril (25 or 50 mg twice daily), each taken for 6 weeks. Eighteen patients with mild to moderately severe hypertension were included. 2. There were no significant differences in systolic or diastolic blood pressure reduction between the two drugs. Pulse rate was slower after atenolol treatment (P less than 0.05). 3. Patients undertook practice on the psychological test battery prior to the treatment phases of the study in order to minimise practice effects. 4. There were no significant differences between the treatments on any of the measures of memory or information processing. 5. Patients reported feeling less anxious during treatment with atenolol (P = 0.02). 6. There were no differences between the drugs in their cognitive effects. The present study has the advantages of using an extensive battery of standard tests in a group of well-practised patients. The decreased anxiety reported with atenolol treatment may have clinical value and probably reflects the well-known effect of beta-adrenoceptor antagonist drugs on the somatic symptoms of situational anxiety.", 
    "226": "Acemannan (ACE-M), a beta-(1,4)-linked acetylated mannan, was evaluated for in vitro activity against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Castanospermine (CAS), deoxymannojirimycin (DMN), swainsonine (SWS), azidothymidine (AZT), and dideoxythymidine (DDC) were tested in parallel as control compounds. In vitro antiviral efficacy of ACE-M was evaluated in a variety of cell lines including human peripheral mononuclear, CEM-SS1 and MT-2(2) cells. The virus strain, number of infectious units per cell, and target cell line were important factors in determining the degree of inhibition of viral cytopathic effect in the presence of ACE-M and other control compounds tested. Maximum inhibitory effect was observed in CEM-SS cells infected with the RFII strain of HIV-1. This inhibitory effect was determined to be concentration-dependent. Assay design included primary screening to measure cell viabilities of infected target cells in the presence and absence of test compounds. When tested on HIV-1/RFII-infected CEM-SS cells, the 50% inhibitory effect of CAS (IC50 = 28), an inhibitor of alpha-glucosidase I, was determined to be similar to that observed for ACE-M (IC50 = 45). However, DMN and SWS, inhibitors of mannosidase I and II, tested in parallel to CAS and ACE-M, exhibited no IC50 values. Antiviral potential of ACE-M as an inhibitor of syncytia formation was also explored using CEM-SS cells. Suppression of syncytia formation was observed at an ACE-M concentration of 31.25 micrograms/ml, and complete inhibition was observed at 62.5 micrograms/ml.

After a mean of 27 months' treatment patients on enalapril had an excess of persistent cough (16 per cent, 95 per cent CI 7-25, p less than 0.01), voice change (14 per cent, 95 per cent CI 2-27, p less than 0.05) and sore throat (10 per cent, 95 per cent CI -0.1 to 20.3 per cent, p less than 0.01) when compared to nifedipine-treated patients.

Cough tended to be more common in women (23 per cent vs. 7.2 per cent), non-smokers, and at higher doses of enalapril, but was not related to age, duration of treatment, or chronic respiratory disease. Dry cough commonly persists as a troublesome side-effect during long-term enalapril treatment, and is often associated with voice change and sore throat.", 
    "228": "The angiotensin II (AT II) levels in plasma were measured 68 times by using radio-immunoassay in 30 patients with viral hepatitis B (HB) and in 35 healthy persons as the control group. The results showed that the AT II levels of patients with HB were much higher than those of the control group (P less than 0.001). They were 219.25 +/- 91.31 ng/L and 60.70 +/- 10.73 ng/L, respectively. These indicated that the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) of the patients was in exciting state. The levels of 8 cases of severe chronic active hepatitis (SCAH) (AT II = 270.40 +/- 106.55 ng/L, 6 cases of subacute fulminant hepatitis (SFH) (AT II = 332.80 +/- 140.12 ng/L), and 4 cases of hepatocirrhosis (HC) (AT II = 218.50 +/- 97.64 pg/ml) were all higher than those of 8 cases of chronic active hepatitis (CAH) (100.50 +/- 83.81 ng/L) and those of 4 cases of acute icteric hepatitis (A1H) (123.33 +/- 64.97 ng/L). These findings showed that the levels of AT II were directly related with the severity of the illness. The AT II levels of 8 cases of HRS (270.50 +/- 66.31 ng/L) were higher that those without HRS (174.50 +/- 78.48 ng/L). After treatment with captopril (CPT), the renal function of the patients returned to normal and the patients got better, while the AT II levels decreased greatly. The results suggested that high AT II levels in plasma may be one of the causes aggressing the HRS. The CPT may inhibit the produce of AT II and there are some therapeutic effects for the HRS.", 
    "229": "The pathogenesis of hypertensive glomerular injury is complex, involving both hemodynamic and nonhemodynamic factors. One can therefore confidently predict that a wide variety of disparate therapeutic interventions, pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic, may be effective in arresting or slowing progressive glomerular injury. Based on the experimental and clinical literature available to date, it is clear that glomerular capillary hypertension is an important pathogenetic factor in this disease and that lowering of Pgc with antihypertensive drugs is associated with prevention of glomerular injury. Furthermore, the CEI may have a special renoprotective effect compared to other antihypertensive agents, most likely due to their unique renal hemodynamic actions. Pending the results of well-designed clinical trials, converting enzyme inhibitors represent the antihypertensive agents most likely to arrest the progressive decline in renal function observed in patients with hypertension and chronic renal failure. The calcium channel blockers are effective antihypertensive agents in patients with chronic renal failure, but whether they confer specific renoprotective effects remains uncertain. Since a large number of patients with chronic renal failure require more than one antihypertensive drug for adequate blood pressure control it may be of interest to evaluate the benefits of drug combinations. In this regard, it is possible that a combination of a CEI and a CCB may have complimentary effects in protecting the kidney. The development of these new classes of antihypertensive agents has had a major impact on the treatment of patients with chronic progressive renal failure. Future studies will hopefully clarify the optimal antihypertensive therapeutic regimen and allow us to move closer to the goal of eliminating end-stage renal failure.", 
    "230": "Angiotensin II was reported to play a key role in ovulation in rats and it seems also to be involved in the regulation of LH release. Thus, we studied the effect of chronic ACE inhibition on the menstrual cycle, measuring daily plasma estradiol, progesterone, LH and FSH, and renin and prorenin before and during the third month of treatment with enalapril (10 mg b.i.d.) in 10 mild essential hypertensive women. Blood pressure was normalized by treatment. The cyclical changes of steroids and gonadotrophins were unaffected in their temporal relationships and in the magnitude of their variation during the experimental cycle compared with the basal cycle. A synchronization of plasma prorenin with the other hormones was seen both before, as previously reported, and during enalapril treatment. Our data show that peripheral blockade of angiotensin I conversion does not affect the pituitary guidance of the ovarian hormonal response or the ovarian prorenin release during the menstrual cycle. Our data are in agreement with the hypothesis that circulating angiotensin II does not play a key role in the human fertility process and that hydrophilic ACE inhibitors can be safely used in the treatment of hypertensive women of reproductive age.", 
    "231": "This is a double-blind, randomized parallel-group multicenter study comprising 340 hypertensive patients. All were treated with 50 mg of atenolol once daily. If their recumbent diastolic blood pressure was greater than or equal to 95 and less than or equal to 115 mm Hg after a 4-week open run-in period, patients were randomized to receive additionally, 5, 10, or 20 mg of lisinopril once daily or placebo for a further 8-week period in a double-blind fashion. The additional effects on the trough (24-28 h after tablet intake) diastolic blood pressure of placebo and 5 mg of lisinopril were not statistically significant. Lisinopril at 10 and 20 mg reduced the recumbent diastolic blood pressure by 3.2 and 3.3 mm Hg, respectively, more than placebo (p = 0.010-0.011). The recumbent systolic blood pressure and heart rate did not change. The side effect profile of lisinopril was not different from that of placebo and adverse effects were few and mild.", 
    "232": "In this study, the effect of bradykinin on coronary flow in the isolated rat heart was significantly potentiated when cysteine or the sulfhydryl-containing converting enzyme inhibitors captopril and zofenoprilat were administered simultaneously. In contrast, the effect of concomitant administration of enalaprilat only slightly increased the effect of bradykinin on coronary flow. In nitrate-tolerant hearts of rats pretreated with isosorbide dinitrate (15 mg daily), the increase in coronary flow by nitroglycerin and bradykinin was significantly less when compared to control hearts. The effect of captopril was not affected by pretreatment. The involvement of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) in the effect of captopril was apparent from experiments with L-arginine, the precursor of EDRF, and L-NMMA, the \"false\" precursor of EDRF. L-Arginine increased the effect of captopril, whereas L-NMMA showed a competitive antagonism for the effect of captopril on coronary flow in the isolated rat heart. Clinically, the effect of captopril was studied in 10 patients with stable, exercise-induced angina pectoris that had been treated for 3 weeks with slow-release isosorbide dinitrate (20 mg four times daily). At day 7, a baseline exercise test was obtained. Subsequently, patients with chest pain and at least 1-mm ST-segment depression on the ECG during exercise were included. They received on day 14 and 21 either captopril (25 mg) or placebo 1 h before exercise testing in a randomized, double-blind, crossover design. Captopril significantly improved the combined score of maximal ST-segment depression, maximal workload, and time to angina when compared to placebo. No differences in the pressure-rate index at rest and during exercise were seen. These results indicate that the sulfhydryl group of certain angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors can potentiate their effect on the endogenous nitrovasodilator EDRF. In the clinical situation, this may lead to an improved exercise performance in patients with stable angina pectoris during chronic nitrate treatment, independent of its systemic vascular effects.", 
    "233": "The purpose of this study was to determine efficacy and safety of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, cilazapril, in the treatment of hypertensive diabetics with renal insufficiency. Fifteen type II diabetics with hypertension and chronic renal insufficiency aged (mean +/- SD) 64 +/- 7 years were studied in a regional clinic and university hospital hypertension unit. The blood pressure was measured biweekly. Urinary collections were done after 2 weeks of placebo and 8 weeks of cilazapril treatment. The blood pressure decreased from 176 +/- 15/105 +/- 9 to 164 +/- 11/95 +/- 9 mm Hg and serum creatinine from 197 +/- 69 to 179 +/- 73 mumol/L. The creatinine clearance rose from 41.6 +/- 11.4 to 47.4 +/- 14.9 ml/min, while protein excretion decreased from 0.8 +/- 1.3 to 0.5 +/- 0.8 g/24 h (p less than 0.05). The blood pressure change was inversely correlated with the creatinine clearance change (r = -0.5, n = 15, p less than 0.05). In these high-risk patients, 8 weeks of cilazapril treatment improved both blood pressure control and renal function but renal function improved most in the patients whose blood pressure changed the least.", 
    "234": "Benazepril is a nonsulfhydryl ACE inhibitor prodrug, which is converted in vivo to its active form, benazeprilat. Data from clinical studies have indicated that benazepril 5 to 80 mg (usually 10 to 20 mg), administered as a single daily dose, effectively decreases blood pressure in patients with mild to moderately severe hypertension. In a small number of comparative studies, the anti-hypertensive efficacy of benazepril appeared to be at least equivalent to that of captopril, enalapril, hydrochlorothiazide, nifedipine, nitrendipine or propranolol at usual therapeutic doses. Combinations of benazepril and hydrochlorothiazide or nifedipine achieved a greater lowering of blood pressure than benazepril alone, and this approach may be suitable for patients with more severe hypertension. Benazepril is reported to have beneficial effects on various indices of cardiac function and to improve clinical symptoms and exercise capacity in patients with congestive heart failure. The tolerability of benazepril in clinical trials has been very good, with an incidence of adverse effects similar to that observed in placebo recipients. Thus, benazepril appears to be an effective alternative to other members of its class for the management of hypertension, and further studies will accurately define its usefulness in congestive heart failure.", 
    "235": "Atenolol is a selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist with a duration of activity of at least 24 hours. The scope of therapeutic use of the drug has been expanded and become better defined since it was first reviewed in the Journal in 1979. Atenolol is effective and generally well tolerated in patients with all grades of hypertension. Data from comparative studies show that when administered orally, atenolol reduces blood pressure to a similar extent, and in a similar proportion of patients, as usual therapeutic doses of other beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (such as acebutolol, celiprolol, betaxolol, indenolol, metoprolol, nadolol, pindolol, propranolol, tertatolol), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (e.g. captopril, enalapril and lisinopril), calcium antagonists (e.g. amlodipine, diltiazem, felodipine, isradipine, nitrendipine, nifedipine, verapamil), doxazosin, ketanserin and alpha-methyldopa. Atenolol effectively lowers blood pressure in elderly patients with hypertension and in women with hypertension associated with pregnancy, and improves objective and subjective indices in patients with stable angina pectoris. Oral atenolol is used for preventing recurrence of supraventricular arrhythmias once control is achieved by intravenous administration of atenolol. Early intervention with intravenous atenolol followed by oral maintenance therapy reduces infarct recurrence and cardiovascular mortality in patients with known or suspected myocardial infarction. There is also encouraging evidence of reduced mortality from cardiovascular disease during long term therapy with atenolol in patients with hypertension. Atenolol is well tolerated in most patients. Increases in plasma levels of both total triglycerides and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglycerides have accompanied atenolol therapy although the clinical relevance, if any, of longer term metabolic effects has yet to be determined. Its low lipid solubility and limited brain penetration results in a lower incidence of central nervous system effects than that associated with propranolol. After many years of clinical usage atenolol is a well established treatment option in several areas of cardiovascular medicine such as mild to moderate hypertension and stable angina pectoris. Furthermore, it has also shown potential in the treatment of some cardiac arrhythmias and has been associated with reduced cardiovascular mortality in patients with hypertension and in patients with myocardial infarction.", 
    "236": "1. The coronary vasoconstrictive response to endothelin (ET-1) was evaluated using the isolated perfused hearts of 15 week old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and age-matched Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). Endothelin produced marked increases in perfusion pressure (PP) in both SHR and WKY. The effects of ET-1 were more potent than those of acetylcholine, vasopressin and angiotensin II. The vascular response to ET-1, expressed as the increase in PP, was greater in SHR than in WKY. 2. Nicardipine (10(-8) mol/L) shifted the concentration-PP response curve for ET-1 to the right. The extent of the rightward shift was greater in SHR than in WKY. Additionally in SHR, Bay K-8644 elicited a dose-dependent increase in PP, the effect being more potent than that in WKY. 3. The increased response of the coronary vasculature to ET-1 was observed after 15 weeks of age but not at 6 weeks, indicating that enhancement of the response develops with ageing in SHR. 4. Enhancement of the vascular response to ET-1 in SHR was prevented by chronic (10 weeks) treatment with enalapril (10 mg/kg per day), but not by hydralazine (30 mg/kg per day). 5. These results indicate that the coronary vascular response to ET-1 increases with age in SHR. The mechanism of the enhanced response may involve the activation of dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca2+ channels, however, this type of mechanism may also be modulated at least in part by the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "237": "Previous studies have shown that administration of captopril to sodium-depleted rats decreases the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and blunts the increase in glomerular prostacyclin synthesis normally occurring in response to sodium depletion. To clarify the relationship between these two responses, iloprost, a stable analogue of prostacyclin, was administered to Na-depleted, captopril-treated (LNC) rats. At a dosage not affecting systemic blood pressure (12.5 ng/kg/min), iloprost increased GFR in LNC rats by 25% (from 0.26 +/- 0.03 to 0.35 +/- 0.03 ml/min/100 g body wt, P less than 0.01), without significant effects on renal plasma flow. No effect was observed in control rats. The results suggest that altered prostacyclin synthesis could contribute to the decrease of GFR in this model.", 
    "238": "The left ventricle of the neonatal pig heart is a model of rapid physiological cardiac growth that is dependent upon accelerated ribosome formation and increased RNA content. The goals of the present study were to investigate the role of angiotensin II in this rapid growth. Hearts from 3 d old control piglets or piglets that were treated with enalapril maleate, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, or DuP 753, an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, were used for measurements of left ventricular mass, RNA, DNA and protein. Hearts from enalapril-treated pigs also were used for measurements of rates of ribosome formation and total protein synthesis during perfusion as modified Langendorff preparations. Treatment of piglets with enalapril maleate resulted in decreased left ventricle/body wt ratio, RNA content, total RNA and total protein in the left ventricle. These parameters were unaffected in the right ventricle. In vitro perfusion of hearts from enalapril-treated piglets revealed decreased ribosome formation and total protein synthesis in the left ventricle. Piglets treated with DuP 753 had decreased left ventricle/body wt ratio as well as decreased RNA content, total RNA and RNA/DNA ratio in the left ventricle. These results suggest that angiotensin II may be required for rapid growth of neonatal pig hearts.", 
    "239": "Serotoninergic control of aldosterone secretion in vivo was investigated in conscious rats with indwelling arterial cannulae. Serial blood samples were taken from the animals before and after i.p. administration of 1 ml (4 g/l) 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), the precursor of serotonin, or saline and they were analysed for 5-HTP, serotonin, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, plasma renin activity (PRA), corticosterone, aldosterone, sodium and potassium concentrations. The role of the renin-angiotensin system was investigated in animals pretreated for 1 week with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (25 mg/day). 5-HTP caused a significant increase in all parameters within 45 min except for sodium and potassium. Saline administration showed no significant effect. Captopril pretreatment did not impair the increase in any parameter by 5-HTP, with the exception of the aldosterone response which was significantly attenuated, though not completely. The results show that administration of 5-HTP, which increases serum serotonin levels, stimulates PRA, aldosterone and corticosterone secretion. Captopril pretreatment inhibits the aldosterone response, suggesting that the aldosterone stimulatory properties of 5-HTP require the presence of angiotensin II, although it is unclear whether it acts in a mediatory or permissive capacity. The failure of captopril to inhibit the aldosterone response completely suggests the involvement of other mechanisms such as the hypothalamo-pituitary adrenal axis or a direct action of serotonin on the adrenal.", 
    "240": "We have examined whether inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme-containing sulfhydryl groups such as, captopril (CPT) or SQ 14,534, the nonsulfhydryl-containing angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, teprotide (TPR) or enalaprilat (ENA) and other structurally unrelated sulfhydryl-containing compounds, N-2-mercaptopropionylglycine (MPG) or N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), could influence platelet aggregation. Incubation of human washed platelets with CPT, SQ 14,534, TPR, ENA, MPG or NAC (0.1-0.5 mM) did not modify their aggregatory responses to thrombin. However, the antiaggregatory properties of endothelial cells cultured from bovine aorta were potentiated by CPT, SQ 14,534, MPG or NAC but not by TPR or ENA (40-100 microM). CPT (100-500 microM) or NAC (50-200 microM) but not ENA (100 and 500 microM) also potentiated the antiaggregatory effects of sodium nitroprusside (1.0 microM) or iloprost (0.2 nM). The ability of the thiol-containing compounds (CPT or NAC) to potentiate the antiaggregatory effects of sodium nitroprusside or iloprost was not associated with an elevation of platelet cyclic GMP or cyclic AMP levels, respectively. Thus, CPT and other sulfhydryl-containing compounds can synergize with antiplatelet compounds, thereby enhancing the ability of endothelial-derived autocoids to inhibit platelet aggregation. The mechanism responsible for this potentiating effect of thiols on platelet aggregation is not known, but may relate to the ability of thiol-containing compounds to act as intracellular scavengers of oxygen-derived free radicals.", 
    "241": "A 12-week, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of imazodan, a type III phosphodiesterase inhibitor, was conducted in 147 patients with congestive heart failure to determine clinical efficacy and safety. Patients were randomized to placebo or 2, 5 or 10 mg of imazodan administered twice daily. Patients were maintained on their standard therapy including diuretics, digoxin and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. The mean ejection fraction was 23 +/- 10%. Exercise time increased from baseline in all 4 groups. There was no significant difference observed between the placebo group and any of the treated groups with regard to exercise time, ejection fraction, frequency of ventricular premature complexes or ventricular tachycardia. When analyzed by intent to treat, the placebo mortality was 7% (3 of 44) and the imazodan mortality was 8% (8 of 103) (p = not significant). This study failed to demonstrate that imazodan provided any benefit in exercise performance when compared with placebo.", 
    "242": "The influence of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition on the development of left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy due to stenosis of the aortic arch was studied in female Sprague-Dawley rats. The aortic arch was banded to an outer diameter of 1.0 mm. After 14 days, LV and right ventricular functional parameters and transstenotic pressure gradient were measured in anesthetized rats. In addition, regional heart weights were determined, and myocytes of three different heart regions were isolated and subjected to morphometric analysis. To inhibit the angiotensin converting enzyme, ramipril was administered orally by gavage in a single daily dose of 1 mg/kg. Rats with aortic stenosis showed a marked increase in LV systolic pressure, mean prestenotic aortic pressure, and LV stroke work compared with sham-operated rats and demonstrated a systolic transstenotic pressure gradient of 82 mm Hg. This increase in LV hemodynamic load was paralleled by the development of LV hypertrophy as determined by a 37% increase in LV weight and by a 20% increase in cell volume of isolated LV myocytes. Concomitant ramipril treatment did not significantly affect LV functional parameters. The transstenotic pressure gradient was the same as in untreated rats with aortic stenosis. Likewise, the weight gain of the LV as well as the development of cellular hypertrophy of the LV were not influenced. Thus, in this model, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition did not reduce the development of LV hypertrophy independent of the hemodynamic load.", 
    "243": "Several therapeutic agents have been tested for secondary prevention after acute myocardial infarction. Each patient presents a clinical challenge and gives the physician an opportunity to use the tests and therapy most likely to benefit the clinical course. The presence of other associated medical conditions, the type of myocardial infarction, the presence or absence of accompanying ischemia, left ventricular dysfunction, intracardiac thrombus, or ventricular arrhythmias dictate the choices that are to be made. It is apparent from this review that no single class of agents can be considered a cure, although beta-adrenergic blocking agents come the closest to this role. Analysis of these drugs helps individualize drug therapy and provides a physiologic probe to understanding the pathophysiologic processes that characterize the period after myocardial infarction. To address the impact of developing technology and drug availability on the practice and cost of medical care, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association have developed guidelines for the management of patients with myocardial infarction. The clinical trial remains the best test for the assessment of therapeutic choices and can also expand our knowledge of the natural history of the disease process. Nevertheless, the issue of appropriate therapy is ever-changing, affected by the explosion of new technology and the continued investigation into the pathophysiology of coronary artery disease.", 
    "244": "Clinical trials in which the selective alpha 1-adrenergic receptor blocker terazosin was given in combination with other antihypertensive agents are reviewed. Results of a recent study examining the effects of combination terazosin and verapamil therapy on blood pressure and heart rate are also presented. In several studies of the combination of terazosin plus a diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide, methyclothiazide, chlorthalidone, furosemide, amiloride, triamterene, metolazone, or spironolactone), significant decreases in one or more of the blood pressure variables studied were demonstrated (compared with diuretic plus placebo). In a placebo-controlled, double-blind study of terazosin plus atenolol, supine and standing blood pressures decreased significantly from baseline (atenolol monotherapy) after the addition of terazosin but not placebo. In a study of terazosin added to background therapy (including beta-blockers, diuretics, methyldopa, clonidine, captopril, guanethidine, hydralazine, and nifedipine), the addition of terazosin resulted in significant decreases in supine and standing diastolic blood pressures compared with baseline values (background therapy alone). Combination antihypertensive therapy with terazosin and verapamil reduced blood pressure to a significantly greater extent than either agent alone. Preliminary pharmacokinetic results indicate that terazosin did not alter the metabolism of verapamil. No significant abnormal laboratory test results have been reported for patients taking terazosin in combination with other antihypertensive agents; in fact some evidence suggests that terazosin may attenuate adverse lipid, glucose, and potassium changes associated with thiazide diuretics. Adverse experiences associated with terazosin combination therapy are usually mild to moderate. Results from all these studies suggest that terazosin effectively controls mild-to-moderate hypertension when it is used in combination with other antihypertensive agents without cumulative adverse effects.", 
    "245": "Characterization of C- and N-terminal forms of angiotensin (Ang) peptides mandated assessment of methods to determine plasma levels. 125I-Ang I, 125I-Ang II, and 125I-Ang(1-7) were added to blood samples in the presence of protease inhibitors. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) inhibited the conversion of 125I-Ang I to 125I-Ang II. o-Phenanthroline and EDTA (EDTA + o-Ph) did not eliminate [des-Asp1] fragments or 125I-Ang(1-7). The combination of EDTA + o-Ph and pepstatin A or 4-(chloromercuri) benzoic acid (PCMB) significantly reduced 125I-Ang(1-7) generation. Only PCMB plus EDTA + o-Ph eliminated [des-Asp1] fragments. Authentic plasma values of Ang peptides require the correct choice of protease inhibitors.", 
    "246": "1. This study was undertaken to examine the possibility that the level of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) increases in vascular tissue, and that this may participate in the pathogenesis of hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR). 2. In SHR, at the established hypertensive stage, the prolonged antihypertensive effect induced by a single oral dose of spirapril was closely correlated to the long-lasting inhibition of ACE in aortae and mesenteric arteries. In contrast, ACE in plasma, lung, heart and kidney recovered from inhibition faster than in vessels. 3. Prolonged daily oral treatment of SHR with spirapril, initiated at the age of 8 weeks and continued for 8 weeks, prevented the development of hypertension with concomitant decrease in aortic ACE activity. Blood pressure continued to be suppressed after the drug was withdrawn, as did the aortic ACE activity. 4. Spontaneously hypertensive rats developed hypertension with age as well as with the increase in aortic ACE activity which became higher with age than that of Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) normotensive control rats. On the contrary, ACE activity in plasma and lung of SHR was substantially lower than that of WKY at any age from 4 to 20 weeks old. Brain ACE activity of SHR did not differ from that of WKY at any age. Aged SHR showed the lower enzyme activity in the kidney compared with that of age-matched WKY. 5. Our results support the hypothesis that increased vascular ACE may play an essential role in the development and maintenance of hypertension in SHR.",

The blood pressure fall with enalapril was later (4-10 hours), longer lasting, and was associated with significant slowing of supine heart rate.

    "255": "1. Both the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, lisinopril, and the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, indomethacin, lower urinary protein excretion in renal disease and improve the selectivity of the residual proteinuria. Despite the clearly different renal haemodynamic profiles of the two drugs, we hypothesize that the antiproteinuric effect has a final common pathway that is a reduction in glomerular filtration pressure. 2. We studied the effects of lisinopril and indomethacin, separately and in combination, on urinary protein excretion, selectivity of proteinuria and renal haemodynamics in nine non-diabetic patients with overt proteinuria. 3. Urinary protein excretion was 5.4 +/- 2.5 g/24 h in the control period. Lisinopril monotherapy lowered urinary protein excretion by 53 +/- 26%. During indomethacin treatment urinary protein excretion was reduced by 63 +/- 24%. After adding indomethacin to lisinopril, urinary protein excretion fell by a further 58 +/- 23%, resulting in a 79 +/- 17% decrease during combined therapy. 4. Although both lisinopril and indomethacin monotherapy appeared to result in an improvement in glomerular protein permeselectivity, no further improvement was seen during the combination therapy. 5. The change in proteinuria were associated with changes in glomerular filtration rate, which showed a pronounced fall with combination therapy. The renal haemodynamic profiles during the different therapies suggest a post-glomerular vasodilatation by lisinopril and a pre-glomerular vasoconstriction by indomethacin, and the combination of both during the combined treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "256": "To determine whether converting enzyme inhibitors could produce peripheral vasodilation through a local mechanism, we infused enalaprilat, 2 micrograms/min/dl forearm volume (FAV), into the brachial artery of normal subjects and measured changes in forearm blood flow (FBF) with strain-gauge plethysmography. Enalaprilat produced a peak increase in FBF of 2.82 +/- 0.54 ml/min/dl FAV (78% increase) at 1 minute (p less than 0.01 versus vehicle) and an increase of 1.11 +/- 0.28 ml/min/dl FAV at 4 minutes (p less than 0.05 versus vehicle). Blood pressure and plasma renin activity measured at the completion of infusion did not change. Intravenous enalaprilat infusion at the same dose in seven additional normal subjects did not increase FBF. Pretreatment of seven subjects with 75 mg oral indomethacin attenuated the peak response to enalaprilat (4.13 +/- 1.52 versus 0.58 +/- 0.32 ml/min/dl; p less than 0.05). We conclude that intra-arterial enalaprilat produces an increase in FBF in normal subjects. This peripheral vasodilation is caused by a local effect independent of circulating renin-angiotensin system inhibition. This response is attenuated by indomethacin, suggesting that prostaglandins contribute to the vasodilator response.",

In this issue of Hypertension, Genden and Molineaux report that yet another peptidase inhibitor, metalloendopeptidase-24.15, EC 3.4.24.15 (EP-24.15), lowers blood pressure in normotensive rats. In this editorial we discuss the possible role of kinins as common mediators of part of the vasodepressor action of these peptidase inhibitors. Genden and Molineaux report that the marked fall in blood pressure caused by the EP-24.15 inhibitor is almost abolished by a kinin receptor antagonist, supporting the hypothesis that kinins play a role in the regulation of normal blood pressure. We have confirmed that the EP-24.15 inhibitor used by these investigators lowers blood pressure. Up to now, EP-24.15 has not been implicated in in vivo metabolism of kinins. Although a number of kininases have been identified, our own previous work indicated that the metabolic pathway responsible for clearing kinins from the circulation involves the action of kininase II (angiotensin I converting enzyme) and renal peptidases. Nevertheless, the main metabolic pathway involved some other unidentified enzyme, since in these experiments disappearance of kinins from the circulation was only marginally reduced by a \"cocktail\" of inhibitors of ACE, EP-24.11, and carboxypeptidase N. It could be that EP-24.15 is involved in kinin metabolism. However, a number of questions need to be answered with regard to the mechanism by which the EP-24.15 inhibitor lowers blood pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "258": "The existence of a vascular renin-angiotensin system and its role in modulating sympathetic activity were evaluated in forearm arterioles of hypertensive individuals. Isoproterenol (0.03, 0.01, 0.3 microgram/100 ml/min for 5 minutes each; n = 5) was infused into the brachial artery, and active and inactive renin, angiotensin II, and norepinephrine forearm balance (venous-arterial differences corrected for forearm blood flow by strain-gauge plethysmography) were measured. Isoproterenol caused vasodilation and a dose-dependent active and inactive renin, angiotensin II, and norepinephrine outflow, an effect blunted by propranolol (10 micrograms/100 ml/min). To evaluate the role of local angiotensin II on beta-mediated norepinephrine overflow, the experiment was repeated with captopril (2.5 micrograms/100 ml/min for 10 minutes; n = 5), which abolished angiotensin II release and significantly reduced norepinephrine overflow. To test whether angiotensin II facilitates both prejunctional norepinephrine release and its postjunctional action, we evaluated the effect of exogenous angiotensin II, infused into the brachial artery at low concentrations (0.001 microgram/100 ml/min), on forearm vasoconstriction and norepinephrine release induced by endogenous sympathetic activation (application of a lower body negative pressure: -10 and -20 mm Hg for 5 minutes, n = 10) and on the vasoconstrictor effect of local norepinephrine (0.0015, 0.005, 0.015, 0.05, 0.15 micrograms/100 ml/min for 3 minutes each; n = 6). Although angiotensin II increased the vasoconstricting effect and the norepinephrine release induced by lower body negative pressure, it failed to affect norepinephrine-mediated vasoconstriction. Our data indicate the existence in hypertensive individuals of a vascular renin-angiotensin system that seems to modulate sympathetic activity through the presynaptic facilitation of norepinephrine release.", 
    "259": "The angiotensin II (ANG II) receptor has recently been shown to exhibit subtypes with respect to antagonist binding. Of particular interest are the potent nonpeptide antagonists, DUP 753 and PD 121981, which exhibit selectivity for the subtype 1 (AT1) and subtype 2 (AT2) receptors, respectively. We used these high-affinity antagonists in competition with 125I-[Sar1,Ile8]ANG II to determine autoradiographically the distribution of these ANG II-receptor subtypes in the renal cortex of rats and rhesus monkeys. Binding of the radioligand to receptor in sections of rat renal cortex was inhibited by DUP 753; inhibition by PD 121981 was not detected. By contrast, AT1 and AT2 receptors are present in the renal cortex of rhesus monkeys in regionally distinct structures. DUP 753 inhibited binding to the ANG II receptor in glomeruli. PD 121981 inhibited binding to arterial smooth muscle and the juxtaglomerular (JG) apparatus. The JG apparatus also exhibits radioligand binding, which is inhibited by DUP 753. The effect of DUP 753 and PD 123177 (a more water-soluble analogue of PD 121981) on changes in plasma renin activity was examined to determine if one or both of these subtypes participate in the ANG II-mediated negative feedback of control of renin release. Although DUP 753 increased plasma renin activity to the same extent as the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, enalaprilat, in rats and rhesus monkeys, the AT2 antagonists did not affect renin release in either species. Thus both subtypes of ANG II receptor are present in rhesus monkey cortex, but a function for only the AT1 subtype was demonstrated.",

The ultimate goal, however, is of course rational or at least semi-rational drug design. In some instances this goal seems to have already been reached as in the case of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and H2 antagonists. In the (near) future results from the steady progress in molecular biology in combination with computer-assisted drug modelling--possibly coupled with artificial intelligence techniques--will help the medicinal chemist in his efforts to attain this goal.", 
    "261": "A method of determining a new angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (CS-622) and its active metabolite (RS-5139) in plasma by inhibitor-binding assay has been developed using high-performance liquid chromatography. The assay is based on the principle that the amount of inhibitor bound to the enzyme is inversely related to the amount of hippuric acid liberated on hydrolysis from the artificial substrate (hippuryl-L-histidyl-L-leucine). Plasma was heated at 60 degrees C for 15 min, to inactivate endogenous enzyme, and preincubated with rabbit-lung angiotensin-converting enzyme at 37 degrees C for 3 min. The artificial substrate (5.75 mg/ml in pH 8.3 phosphate buffer containing sodium chloride) was added to the resulting solution, and the mixture was incubated for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 2 M hydrochloric acid. The hippuric acid liberated on hydrolysis was extracted with ethyl acetate and determined by reversed-phase chromatography using methylparaben as an internal standard. The total concentration of the inhibitor and its metabolite were determined by this method after de-esterification by rat-plasma esterase. The standard curve was obtained by the regression analysis of log concentration against logit response. The within-day and day-to-day precision were satisfactory. The proposed method is simple, rapid and sensitive enough to determine angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor in plasma.",

Over the past two years, shortly after the introduction of this type of drug the occurrence of acute renal failure mainly in elderly patients has been reported. The authors have insisted that strict control of renal function and electrolytes are necessary before and after administration of an ACE inhibitor. Particular caution is needed in patients with severe atherosclerotic disease, especially if bilateral (or unilateral in patients with a single kidney) renal arterial stenosis is present or suspected. Considering these limitations ACE inhibitors remain well tolerated and beneficial cardiovascular drugs.",

    "264": "Both cDNA and genomic clones for the nuclear genes encoding chloroplast (cp) (gapA and gapB) and cytosolic (gapC) glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) from Arabidopsis thaliana have been isolated and characterized. Genomic Southern-blot analyses indicate that there is only one copy of each gapA, gapB and gapC gene in A. thaliana. Comparison of the deduced amino acid (aa) sequences shows that the A and B subunits are highly similar (80% positional aa identity), while there is less similarity between the cp and cytosolic subunits (45% aa identity). These relationships are consistent with the idea that the cp and cytosolic GAPDHs evolved from different lineages, as suggested in our previous study of tobacco GAPDHs [Shih et al., Cell 47 (1986) 73-80]. In addition, the chromosomal locations for the three gap genes were determined by restriction fragment length polymorphism mapping; the three gap genes are not closely linked, gapA (55.8 cM) and gapC (0.0 cM) are on chromosome 3, and gapB (51.3 cM) is on chromosome 1.",

In the control group of six untreated SHRSP fed Stroke-Prone Rodent Diet and 1% NaCl drinking solution, all animals developed severe hypertension and stroke by 16.1 weeks of age. In eight salt-loaded SHRSP treated with oral captopril (50 mg/kg/day) beginning at 8.4 weeks of age, systolic blood pressure was slightly but temporarily suppressed and then continued to rise; by 12 weeks of age systolic blood pressure reached levels of severe hypertension, 240 +/- 8 mm Hg, and did not differ from that of untreated SHRSP. No deaths or brain lesions were noted in captopril-treated SHRSP despite severe hypertension maintained through 26 weeks of age when the study ended. Captopril treatment prevented increases in urinary protein excretion (14 +/- 2 v 63 +/- 16 mg/day at 11.7 weeks of age, P less than .01) and the severe brain, renal, and cardiac vascular lesions observed in untreated SHRSP. When maintained on Stroke-Prone Rodent Diet and saline, plasma renin activity of untreated SHRSP surviving until 14.5 weeks of age was markedly increased (29.1 +/- 9.4 ng Ang I/mL/h) compared with either untreated SHRSP (9.2 +/- 2.5 ng Ang I/mL/h, P less than .01) or Wistar-Kyoto rats (3.5 +/- 1.0 ng Ang I/mL/h, P less than .01) maintained on standard diet and water.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "267": "To evaluate the effects of hypertension on cardiac hypertrophy, on myocardial structure, and on ventricular arrhythmias, 27 3-month-old spontaneously hypertensive rats were treated with enalapril (10 mg/kg) daily for 11 months and compared with 26 untreated control rats. Systolic arterial pressure was significantly decreased in treated rats, and at the end of the experiment, it was 199 +/- 3 mm Hg (treated) versus 237 +/- 3 mm Hg (controls) (p less than 0.001). At this time, spontaneous arrhythmias and induced arrhythmias either by programmed electrical stimulation (train of stimuli +1 or 2 extrastimuli) or by trains of eight stimuli at decreasing coupling intervals were observed in isolated heart preparations. Comparing enalapril-treated and control rats, spontaneous arrhythmias (9 of 27 versus 20 of 26, respectively; p less than 0.01), programmed stimulation-induced arrhythmias (3 of 26 versus 12 of 23, respectively; p less than 0.01), and trains of stimuli-induced arrhythmias (4 of 26 versus 14 of 19, respectively, p less than 0.001) were less frequent in the enalapril group. Left ventricular weight was decreased in treated rats by 18% (p less than 0.001). Enalapril administration diminished the fraction of myocardium occupied by foci of replacement fibrosis normally occurring in control rats by 59% (p less than 0.001). Finally, a significant correlation was found between left ventricular weight, the extent of myocardial fibrosis, and the occurrence of ventricular fibrillation. It was concluded that chronic treatment with enalapril, which resulted in attenuation of systemic arterial pressure by limiting cardiac hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis, decreases the propensity of the heart of hypertensive rats to arrhythmogenesis.", 
    "268": "Bradykinin can be inactivated by the peptidases angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and neutral endopeptidase (NEP), both of which are present in the airways. We evaluated the role of these enzymes in bradykinin-induced airway microvascular leakage and lung resistance in anesthetized and mechanically ventilated guinea pigs. We studied the effects of captopril (inhaled; 350 nmol), a specific ACE inhibitor, and phosphoramidon (inhaled; 7.5 nmol), a specific NEP inhibitor. Airway microvascular leakage was measured with the albumin marker Evans Blue dye (20 mg/kg i.v.), and airflow obstruction was measured as lung resistance (RL). Bradykinin was given by inhalation (0.1, 0.3 and 1 mM; 45 breaths), and caused a dose-dependent increase in both RL and airway microvascular leakage. Inhibition of NEP or ACE potentiated the bradykinin-induced microvascular leakage in main bronchi and proximal and distal intrapulmonary airways. However, only NEP inhibition significantly potentiated the extravasation of Evans Blue dye into the tracheal wall and lumen. The combined inhibition of NEP and ACE significantly potentiated plasma leakage at all airway levels, as well as the increase in RL induced by inhaled bradykinin. Recovery RL after one lung inflation significantly correlated with the extravasation of Evans Blue dye in the tissue at all airway levels, indicating that airway edema may have contributed to airway narrowing. We conclude that in the guinea pig, both NEP and ACE modulate bradykinin-induced airway microvascular leakage.",

Saturation studies with [3H]ceranapril identified that the specific binding (defined by captopril, 10 microM) was homogenous and of high affinity. ACE inhibitor recognition site density was higher by some 70% in the temporal cortex (Brodmann area 22) from Alzheimer's patients whereas densities were similar in frontal cortex and cerebellum when compared to control tissue. It is unknown whether this apparently selective alteration in ACE density is directly related to, or a compensatory effect of the disease, but it provides additional support for the development of compounds which interact with the central angiotensin system as novel therapies for cognitive dysfunction.",

The patients were randomly assigned in a double-blind manner to receive 20 mg of enalapril daily or 300 mg of hydralazine plus 160 mg of isosorbide dinitrate daily.

The lower mortality in the enalapril arm was attributable to a reduction in the incidence of sudden death, and this beneficial effect was more prominent in patients with less severe symptoms (New York Heart Association class I or II). In contrast, body oxygen consumption at peak exercise was increased only by hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate treatment (P less than 0.05), and left ventricular ejection fraction, which increased with both regimens during the 2 years after randomization, increased more (P less than 0.05) during the first 13 weeks in the hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate group.",

However, the use of captopril during pregnancy is limited because of reported fetal and neonatal side effects. This study explored the efficacy of sublingual captopril in postpartum management of severe preeclampsia. Captopril controlled the systolic and diastolic pressures within normal range in two patients. The other three patients responded moderately and were switched to hydralazine, clonidine, or nifedipine after 12 hours. The systolic and diastolic pressures of these three patients remained moderately elevated over the 24-hour duration of the study while their pulse rates increased. Captopril did not significantly increase the pulse rate in any of the patients studied, and no other side effects were noted. All patients had normal pressures at their 2- and 6-week postpartum check-up. We conclude that sublingual captopril may be used safely and effectively in managing postpartum hypertension in patients with severe preeclampsia.",

This heralds an extremely poor prognosis and mortality in this group has been estimated to be 80 to 100 times greater than that of an age-matched normal population. The excess mortality and its associated morbidity exists for both insulin-dependent and non-insulin-dependent patients who develop proteinuria. The final cause of death is often cardiovascular, such as myocardial infarction or a cerebrovascular accident, rather than end stage renal failure with death from uraemia. Strict and aggressive control of blood pressure during this stage is the only therapy that has been shown to slow the decline in glomerular filtration. To date, there have been no studies large enough to establish if this can produce the desired effect of reducing the excess mortality in this group. The newer antihypertensive agents may have a specific role but this also remains to be shown conclusively; their major advantage may be related to their fewer side-effects especially on cardiovascular risk factors in this highly susceptible group.",

Each subject received all four treatments and the study was conducted as a randomized, latin square, open design with at least 1 week washout between studies. Overall, HCT was bioequivalent under all conditions and enalaprilat was bioequivalent when given in combination with HCT either as one tablet or as two separate tablets. However, when given with HCT, the mean AUC and Cmax of enalaprilat were reduced up to 20 per cent compared with enalapril administered alone.

The latter include the prostaglandins (PGE-2, PGI-2), dopamine and atrial natriuretic factor. The response of the kidney to chronic heart failure, i.e. vasoconstriction and antinatriuresis, resembles the renal reaction to volume depletion. The adverse renal effects of ACE inhibitors in some patients with advanced congestive heart failure may be explained by lowering of renal perfusion pressure and dependence of glomerular filtration rate on angiotensin II.", 
    "288": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors suppress plasma concentrations of the sodium retaining hormones angiotensin II and aldosterone. This action should potentiate the natriuretic and diuretic effects of loop diuretics. Some studies indicate, however, that the introduction of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors for the treatment of cardiac failure is associated with transient weight gain and the development of oedema. We have compared the natriuretic and diuretic response to intravenous frusemide 40 mg alone with the natriuretic and diuretic response to intravenous frusemide 40 mg following the administration of a single dose of captopril in 12 supine male patients with stable chronic cardiac failure. Captopril lowered the 4 h diuretic response to frusemide from 1160 (60) to 685 (77) ml (P less than 0.05) and the natriuretic response from 120 (9.6) to 68 (11.7) mmol (P less than 0.05). Creatinine clearance fell after captopril from 91 (7.2) to 57 (7.7) ml min-1 (P less than 0.05).

Plasma aldosterone concentrations were not significantly lower following captopril. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors cause an acute fall in creatinine clearance which may reduce the effects of loop diuretics and attention must be paid to diuretic dosage when initiating angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors for the treatment of cardiac failure.",

    "290": "A large-scale, prospective, 8-week, office-based study was conducted to evaluate the effects of adding captopril to a therapeutic regimen of diuretic and digoxin or diuretic alone in the management of patients with mild to moderate congestive heart failure (CHF). A total of 2218 primary care physicians evaluated 6669 patients over the study period for efficacy parameters, which included changes in a modified New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification, symptomatology, and daily activity levels. Overall, 63.8% of evaluated patients improved with regard to functional ability, with 19% improving two or more modified NYHA classes. Symptoms of CHF, including dyspnea on exertion, fatigue, and orthopnea and signs, including rales and peripheral edema, were reduced in 86% of these patients: 41.5% demonstrated mild improvement; 30.0%, moderate improvement; and 14.5%, marked improvement. Three parameters, with which patients reported having difficulty at study entry, were assessed serially to evaluate changes in functional capacity; 78.5% of patients reported an increased walking distance, 72.3% had increased capacity for climbing stairs, and 60.2% had improved capacity for individual recreational activities. Adverse experiences were reported in 18.1% of all patients; 4.9% of patients withdrew from the study because of an adverse effect. Combination therapy with captopril and diuretic for CHF was shown to be safe and effective regardless of patient age (less than 70 years vs. greater than or equal to 70 years), duration of heart failure (less than 1 year vs. greater than 1 year), presence of digoxin treatment, or the dosing schedule employed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "291": "The authors investigated the extent to which endogenously produced metabolities of the cyclooxygenase pathway and angiotensin II modulate the pulmonary vascular response to increasing pulmonary blood flow after a period of systemic and pulmonary hypotension and hypoperfusion (defined as posthypoperfusion) in conscious, pentobarbital-anesthetized, and halothane-anesthetized dogs. The authors tested the hypothesis that vasodilator metabolites of the cyclooxygenase pathway offset the vasoconstrictor influence of angiotensin II to prevent pulmonary vasoconstriction posthypoperfusion. Baseline and posthypoperfusion pulmonary vascular pressure-cardiac index (P/Q) plots were constructed by stepwise inflation and deflation, respectively, of a hydraulic occluder implanted around the inferior vena cava to vary Q. In intact (no drug), conscious dogs, the pulmonary vascular P/Q relationship posthypoperfusion was not altered significantly compared with baseline. In contrast, after cyclooxygenase inhibition, active flow-independent pulmonary vasoconstriction (12-17%; P less than 0.01) was observed posthypoperfusion, and this response was abolished entirely by angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibition. During pentobarbital anesthesia, significant pulmonary vasoconstriction (27%; P less than 0.01) occurred posthypoperfusion in the no-drug condition. However, the magnitude of the posthypoperfusion vasoconstriction was not increased by cyclooxygenase inhibition, nor was it reduced by converting-enzyme inhibition. During halothane anesthesia, pulmonary vasoconstriction was not observed posthypoperfusion in the no-drug condition, but it was unmasked (8-13%; P less than 0.05) by cyclooxygenase inhibition and attenuated partially by converting-enzyme inhibition. These results indicate that cyclooxygenase metabolites and angiotensin II exert opposing vasodilator and vasoconstrictor effects, respectively, on the pulmonary circulation of conscious dogs posthypoperfusion. These competing mechanisms are active during halothane anesthesia but are abolished during pentobarbital anesthesia.", 
    "292": "Benazepril, a newer angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, has been evaluated for the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension in patients 55 years of age and older. The results of the clinical trials conducted to date indicate that benazepril provides effective antihypertensive therapy in this population, with efficacy comparable to that demonstrated in younger patients. Benazepril does not produce precipitous decreases in diastolic blood pressure following the initial dose, and is well tolerated by the elderly. It has a safety profile similar to that of placebo and generally better than that of hydrochlorothiazide.", 
    "293": "Antihypertensive drugs have various effects, both positive and negative, on metabolic and hemodynamic risk factors for coronary artery disease. Cardioprotective effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have recently been described. The benefits of ACE inhibition include not only a reduction in blood pressure but also improved insulin responsiveness, prevention of potassium loss, diminished myocardial oxygen demand, suppression of catecholamines, and interaction with bradykinin and prostaglandins. These benefits result in improved perfusion of vital organs, diminished cardiac work, and protection of coronary vessels, evident in improved left ventricular systolic and diastolic function, elevation of the anginal threshold in ischemic heart disease, and decreased morbidity and mortality in congestive heart failure.", 
    "294": "Modification of the renin-angiotensin system, part of a powerful feedback system for long-term control of arterial pressure and volume homeostasis, through use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, offers a powerful means of reducing blood pressure in many hypertensive patients. There is considerable evidence to suggest that the chronic renal and blood pressure actions of ACE inhibitors are mediated mainly by blockade of angiotensin II formation, rather than by other effects such as increased levels of kinins or prostaglandins. The long-term actions of angiotensin II and aldosterone on blood pressure are closely intertwined with their effects on volume homeostasis and the renal pressure natriuresis mechanism. In most instances, changes in angiotensin II and aldosterone act to amplify the effectiveness of pressure natriuresis and minimize changes in blood pressure needed to maintain sodium balance. When angiotensin II or aldosterone levels are inappropriately elevated, the antinatriuretic effects of these hormones shift pressure natriuresis to higher levels, thereby necessitating increased blood pressure to maintain sodium balance. Control of renal excretory function and modulation of pressure natriuresis by angiotensin II is mediated by intrarenal and extrarenal effects, including stimulation of aldosterone secretion. Current evidence indicates that the intrarenal effects of angiotensin II are quantitatively more important than changes in aldosterone in regulating renal excretion and arterial pressure. The intrarenal actions of angiotensin II include a direct effect on tubular sodium transport as well as a potent constrictor action on efferent arterioles, which increases reabsorption by altering peritubular capillary forces. The constrictor effect of angiotensin II on efferent arterioles also helps to stabilize glomerular filtration rate and therefore excretion of metabolic waste products, an action that may be particularly important when renal perfusion is impaired (e.g., in renal artery stenosis or heart failure).", 
    "295": "The introduction of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors marks a new era in the understanding and treatment of high blood pressure. Although the benefits of therapy with ACE inhibitors are documented, it is more difficult to isolate the principal mechanisms that account for their effective actions in the treatment of hypertension. Recent data suggest that these agents affect both the pressor and depressor mechanisms that regulate vascular tone and cardiac function. For example, ACE inhibitors decrease angiotensin II-mediated vasoconstriction, reduce adrenal medullary catecholamine release, restore baroreceptor activity, and normalize vasomotor sympathetic activity. Experimental work indicates that ACE inhibitors also act on hypertensive mechanisms via actions on the central nervous system. Cardiovascular centers in the brain have receptor sites for angiotensin II and contain the proteins required for local synthesis of angiotensins. Vasomotor neurons possess such receptors and exhibit ACE activity. In addition, angiotensin II receptors involved in the regulation of baroreceptor activity are present in neuronal elements of the baroreflex arc. It is suggested that ACE inhibitors reach the brain via circumventricular organs to reduce sympathetic activity and enhance baroreceptor sensitivity. New studies suggest that depressor actions of ACE inhibitors include enhanced biosynthesis of vasodilator prostaglandins. From animal experiments it is deduced that enhanced production of angiotensin-(1-7) after inhibition of ACE stimulates release of vasodilator prostaglandins. These investigations clarify the function of tissue renin-angiotensin systems in the control of blood pressure in both normal and hypertensive states.", 
    "296": "Benazepril is a prodrug that, following rapid conversion to benazeprilat, is a potent nonsulfhydryl inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme. The absorption, bioactivation, distribution, and elimination of benazepril and benazeprilat have been evaluated in healthy subjects, hypertensive patients, and patients with characteristics known to alter the pharmacokinetic disposition of ACE inhibitors, such as renal impairment, hepatic impairment, and advanced age. Following oral administration, benazepril is absorbed and transformed into benazeprilat in the liver. Coadministration of benazepril with food delays absorption slightly but does not affect the ultimate bioavailability of benazeprilat. Severe hepatic impairment slows conversion of benazepril to benazeprilat but does not affect the overall bioavailability of benazeprilat; thus dosage adjustment is not necessary in the hepatically impaired population. Mild-to-moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance greater than 30 ml/min) slightly increases benazeprilat concentrations; severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 ml/min) reduces benazeprilat elimination and requires dosage reduction. In elderly patients, benazepril disposition is the same as in younger patients, although benazeprilat clearance is slightly reduced. No clinically significant drug-drug interactions occur with benazepril and many other medications commonly prescribed to elderly hypertensive patients. The pharmacokinetic characteristics of benazepril are stable over a wide range of conditions, and dosage adjustments for pharmacokinetic reasons are required infrequently.", 
    "297": "Recent experimental studies suggest that the resistance state of the preglomerular and postglomerular capillary arterioles may determine if a particular class of antihypertensive agents will protect the kidney from hemodynamically mediated glomerular injury. This review discusses (1) the effects of angiotensin II on the renal microcirculation, (2) the pathophysiology of essential hypertensive renal disease, (3) the renal pharmacology of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and (4) the hypothesis that renal protection is dependent on control of systemic and glomerular hypertension.", 
    "298": "Data from clinical trials with benazepril suggest that the safety profile of benazepril is similar to that of other angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Treatment-related side effects occurred in 20% of benazepril-treated patients and in 18% of patients receiving placebo. The most commonly reported side effects with benazepril were headache, dizziness, and fatigue. The incidence of side effects was not affected by the degree of hypertension, age, gender, race, dosage, or the degree of renal impairment. Side effects believed to be related to the pharmacologic action of ACE inhibitors as a class include symptomatic hypotension, which occurred at a relatively low rate with benazepril, and hyperkalemia and elevation of serum creatinine, which occurred to the same extent with benazepril as has been noted with other ACE inhibitors. The mechanism of cough as an ACE inhibitor side effect is unknown; the incidence was similar to that with other ACE inhibitors. Rash and taste disturbance have occurred rarely with benazepril. The incidence of neutropenia and of proteinuria was the same in both the benazepril and placebo groups. Renal failure in hypertensive patients treated with benazepril has not been reported. Overall, benazepril is generally well tolerated by hypertensive patients. The incidence of most side effects is comparable to that with other ACE inhibitors and placebo.", 
    "299": "The safety and efficacy of benazepril, as monotherapy or as part of combination therapy with the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, have been assessed in a number of studies, including comparative trials with the antihypertensive agents propranolol and nifedipine. These studies have included over 1300 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. Comparisons of the efficacy of benazepril and hydrochlorothiazide alone and in combination have shown that benazepril 20 mg once daily is as effective as or more effective in lowering diastolic blood pressure than hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg once daily and that the combination of benazepril 20 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg has a possibly synergistic effect on diastolic blood pressure. The results of comparative trials of benazepril with propranolol and nifedipine suggest that benazepril, administered alone or with the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, is as effective as the other antihypertensive agents alone or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide. An additional study demonstrated that the combination of benazepril and nifedipine further lowered diastolic blood pressure in patients not responding to monotherapy with these agents. The safety of monotherapy with benazepril was found to be similar to that of the other antihypertensive agents. Safety of the combination of benazepril and hydrochlorothiazide was shown to be better than that of the combination of propranolol and hydrochlorothiazide. An attenuation of adverse experiences observed during nifedipine monotherapy was obtained when benazepril was added to the nifedipine regimen.", 
    "300": "The dose-response curve for benazepril, a new angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, has been established from a systematic series of controlled clinical studies in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. The studies included a dose-ranging study, four dose-response studies (placebo-controlled or crossover), and four titration trials. The dose-response studies involved 803 patients and evaluated doses from 2 to 80 mg. Analysis of the data revealed the existence of a dose-response relationship over the dosage range of 10 to 80 mg given once daily. Efficacy of once-daily administration was shown by the persistence of significant blood pressure reduction over the 24-h dosing interval. In addition, the net trough-to-peak ratio (an indicator of net antihypertensive effect at the end of the dosing interval) was generally greater than 50%. The dose-determination studies with benazepril were conducted according to a well-designed strategy in which parameters were carefully defined. Based on these trials, the initial dosage for benazepril appears to be 10 mg once daily. Additional response may be observed at dosages up to 80 mg once daily.", 
    "301": "Many pharmacologic agents are effective in normalizing blood pressure in the hypertensive patient. The major issues in antihypertensive therapy today transcend control of blood pressure and focus, instead, on safety considerations, patient acceptance, and additional benefits to target organs. With the drugs currently available, 10-15% of patients withdraw from therapy because of undesirable clinical side effects. Nonclinical side effects such as hyperlipidemia, hypokalemia, and hyperglycemia can limit the clinician's choice of drugs, especially for elderly patients. Antihypertensive agents should also limit target organ damage. The prevalence of stroke can be reduced solely by controlling blood pressure, but inhibition of cardiac ischemic events requires use of specific classes of agents. Beta blockers reduce mortality and reinfarction postmyocardial infarction, whereas angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors affect several factors leading to heart failure, including cardiac and vascular hypertrophy, remodeling and dilatation postmyocardial infarction, and arrhythmias. Specific actions on intrarenal and other vascular dynamics may make these drugs appropriate for use in patients with diabetes and perhaps hypertensive kidney disease and systemic arterial disease. The range of options available in antihypertensive therapy in the 1990s affords the physician the opportunity to meet additional goals of therapy, specific for each patient.", 
    "302": "The effects of monotherapy with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor benazepril (10 mg once daily) on cardiovascular baroreceptor reflexes were determined in 10 patients with essential hypertension using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over protocol. Early sino-aortic baroreceptor/heart rate reflex resetting was apparent with acute treatment; this effect persisted throughout the active treatment period. Changes in baroreflex sensitivity did not appear to mediate the hypotensive effect of benazepril.", 
    "303": "Pharmacological blockade of the renin-angiotensin converting enzyme reportedly alters the heart rate (HR) power spectrum in conscious dogs, suggesting that these hormones contribute to the short-term regulation of arterial blood pressure. We tested this possibility using four independent procedures. First, HR power spectrum was determined in seven awake dogs before and after administration of enalaprilat (300 ng/kg), a converting-enzyme inhibitor. There were no significant changes in the average amplitude for the spectral peak between 0.003 and 0.1 Hz (i.e., the \"low-frequency peak\"). Second, the HR power spectrum was measured in 11 awake rabbits before and after treatment with deoxycorticosterone acetate (1 mg.kg-1.day-1) and salt (0.9% saline ad libitum) for 7 days to depress plasma renin levels. There were no significant changes in the amplitude of the HR power spectrum, although mean HR decreased from 206 +/- 3 to 184 +/- 4 beats/min after treatment. In the third experiment, another group of rabbits (n = 8) was tested after 2 wk on a low-salt diet to elevate plasma angiotensin levels and then after 2 wk on a normal salt diet. Once again there were no significant effects on the HR power spectrum. Finally, tranquilized dogs (n = 9) were subjected to sinusoidally varying lower body negative pressure at selected frequencies of 0.008-0.12 Hz. Tests were conducted in the control state and after administration of an angiotensin receptor antagonist (saralasin, 1 microgram.kg-1.min-1). Lower body negative pressure-induced fluctuations in arterial blood pressure were similar in both states. We find no evidence for the role of the renin-angiotensin system in the moment-to-moment regulation of arterial pressure and HR.", 
    "304": "Considerable evidence suggests that hyperactivity of the sympathetic nervous system is implicated not only in the pathogenesis of essential hypertension but also in several blood pressure-independent complications of essential hypertension. Even with the advent of newer antihypertensive agents, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium antagonists, the centrally acting sympatholytics (alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists) remain a valuable group of medications for the management of hypertension of all grades of severity. Their advantages include efficacy; rarity of contraindication; absence of most metabolic and serious side effects; favorable effects on systemic hemodynamics; lack of true tolerance and infrequency of volume expansion-related pseudotolerance; suitability in the elderly, in isolated systolic hypertension, and in patients with various concomitant conditions, such as diabetes mellitus; ability to reverse left ventricular hypertrophy; and relative low cost. The long duration of action of guanfacine hydrochloride, the most recently marketed agent, and of the transdermal formulation of clonidine is an especially commendable feature. The principal disadvantages of this class of medications are an overlap between the therapeutic dosage and that producing sedation and dry mouth and the potential to cause the discontinuation syndrome and sexual dysfunction.", 
    "305": "Drug-induced kidney disease is common, especially in hospitalized patients, and prompt recognition of the various nephrotoxic syndromes is important because many are reversible. Risk factors should be assessed before patients are given an agent that may cause acute renal failure (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, aminoglycoside antibiotic, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, radiocontrast agent). Discontinuation of the responsible drug is often the only necessary therapy.",

CHF was fatal in less than 1 month in five patients (two had shown some initial improvement). The other 20 had sustained improvement by at least one functional class, interrupted by episodes of CHF that usually responded to intravenous therapy. Median survival was 12 months (range 10 days to greater than 3 years); five patients died suddenly, 12 died of intractable CHF, and two died of other causes. Six patients were alive 3 years after the onset of treatment with pimobendan. Add-on therapy with pimobendan produced a sustained improvement in many patients with severe CHF that was no longer responding to a combination of digoxin, diuretics, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.",

The pharmacokinetics of the molecule mean that effective blood levels and hence good control of blood pressure are maintained throughout the dosing interval. Dose-ranging studies have shown the most appropriate starting dose is 5 mg once daily, with simple adjustment to 10 mg if necessary. Comparative studies with other agents have shown amlodipine to have antihypertensive efficacy superior to verapamil and comparable with atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide, captopril or nitrendipine. When used in combination with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers or thiazide diuretics, amlodipine can produce important additional antihypertensive effects. Studies involving long-term use of amlodipine in hypertension indicate that no tolerance appears, and that amlodipine is a well tolerated drug.",

None of our patients needed drug treatment for heart failure, but their exercise capacity was markedly limited. Plasma neurohormone concentrations at baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment were also compared with those of healthy controls. Concentrations of plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentrations remained high throughout the study in those patients on beta-blockers. Enalapril treatment had no definite effect on the concentrations of plasma atrial natriuretic peptide or other neurohormone.",

In the nitrendipine group (n = 67, mean age 48 +/- 11 years), nitrendipine (20-40 mg/day) was administered for 24 months, and in the captopril group (n = 67, mean age 47 +/- 12 years), captopril (75-150 mg/day) was also given for 24 months.

    "311": "1. The present study was designed to determine how the natriuretic and diuretic actions of atrial natriuretic peptides were modulated by circulating angiotensin II. 2. In sodium pentobarbitone-anaesthetized rats, administration of bolus doses of atriopeptin III (1000 ng kg-1) had no effect on blood pressure, renal blood flow, or glomerular filtration rate but caused reversible increases (all P less than 0.001) in urine flow, of 53.9 +/- 14.4 microliters kg-1 min-1, absolute sodium excretion, of 13.4 +/- 2.9 mumol kg-1 min-1 and fractional sodium excretion of 3.26 +/- 0.74%. Similar effects were seen following a second dose of the atriopeptin III. 3. Following blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with captopril (900 micrograms kg-1 h-1), control levels of blood pressure and haemodynamics were unchanged but there were significant (all P less than 0.001) increases in urine flow, from 39.96 +/- 5.05 to 88.70 +/- 8.41 microliters kg-1 min-1, absolute sodium excretion, from 8.35 +/- 1.08 to 21.62 +/- 1.62 mumol kg-1 min-1 and fractional sodium excretion, from 3.82 +/- 0.23 to 5.34 +/- 0.32%.

In another group of rats given captopril, angiotensin II at ongkg-1 min1 was also infused; this had no effect on blood pressure or renal haemodynamics, but partially restored basal levels of sodium and water excretion to those obtained before captopril. Atriopeptin III reversibly increased urine flow and absolute sodium excretion to the same degree as that obtained without captopril, but fractional sodium excretion was significantly larger than that obtained in the absence of captopril. In rats infused with angiotensin II at 15ngkg-1min1' together with the captopril the basal levels of fluid output were unchanged, while the magnitudes of the urine flow and sodium excretory responses to atriopeptin III were identical to those obtained before captopril and angiotensin II.5. In animals subjected to two weeks of a low-sodium diet, atriopeptin III reversibly increased urine flow, absolute and fractional sodium excretions by between 53% and 74%; these responses were significantly (P < 0.001) smaller than those obtained in sodium replete rats. Administration of atriopeptin III, to low sodium diet rats given captopril, induced excretory responses which were significantly larger than those obtained in the absence of captopril. 6. The findings of this investigation demonstrate that in acute situations, angiotensin II exerts an important modulatory influence on the natriuretic potency of the atrial peptides by attenuating their action on the kidney. Long-term activation of the renin-angiotensin system depresses the renal excretory responses to atrial natriuretic peptides but suppression of angiotensin II production only partially restores the responsiveness of the kidney.", 
    "312": "Left ventricular hypertrophy is now recognized as an important risk marker in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Left ventricular hypertrophy is an integral component of the complex pathophysiology of primary hypertension and results from mechanical, neurohumoral, and genetic factors. The renin-angiotensin system is involved with the production of left ventricular hypertrophy, not only through the effects on systemic arterial blood pressure but also by both direct and indirect effects on myocardial cell growth. The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are effective drugs for reducing blood pressure in primary hypertension. ACE inhibitor therapy is also associated with regression of left ventricular hypertrophy and restoration of normal diastolic and systolic left ventricular function. Regression of left ventricular hypertrophy is associated with improved prognosis. Thus, when left ventricular hypertrophy regression is a goal of antihypertensive treatment, the ACE inhibitors are effective drugs.",

This was done by relating the results of renal vein renin tests, the captopril test, and renal scintigraphic tests to the blood pressure outcome 12 months after relief of renal artery stenosis by percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty in 31 patients. Cure was seen in eight (26%). Improved blood pressure was obtained in 12 patients (39%), and in 11 patients (35%), the result for blood pressure was a failure. The accuracies of the two mathematical models used to analyze the renal vein renin assays were 44% and 60%. The captopril test showed a sensitivity of 36% and an accuracy of 43%. Renal captopril technetium Tc 99m-labeled pentetic acid scintigraphy gave a sensitivity of 60%. Stepwise logistic regression analysis of clinical variables in relation to blood pressure response revealed age as the only factor significantly related to blood pressure outcome. We conclude that the tests used are unfit for helping select patients for percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty and that age may have an important influence on outcome.",

LV afterload as characterized by systolic meridional wall stress, LV size and pump function, and physical exercise capacity of the transplant patients are not influenced by the therapeutic regimen chosen in this study.",

Selective coronary embolization was produced by injection of microspheres into the left ventricle during ascending aorta occlusion. The hemodynamic data were examined in conscious rats 21 days after embolization or sham operation before and after captopril bolus injection (1 mg/kg) by using microspheres method. Captopril injection caused a significant increase of the blood flow in the heart, kidneys, skin and some intestinal organs.", 
    "318": "Captopril an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, was evaluated for teratogenic potential in Wistar rats. The drug was administered daily from 6 to 15 day of gestation by gavage (0, 3, 10 and 30 mg/kg/day) and perinatal studies were conducted. Captopril decreased food consumption and suppressed gain in body weight. However, no alteration in food efficiency index was observed. The treatment of rats with captopril in doses of 10 and 30 mg/kg, significantly reduced the mean number of implants per litter size and produced intrauterine growth retardation. The incidence of external and visceral malformations were neither dose related nor significantly different from those of controls. In addition, animal treated with these dose levels showed decreased ossification of digits, sternum and skull of the offsprings. The data of the present study indicates that captopril was not found to be teratogenic to Wistar rats. However, adverse effects on intrauterine growth, fetal ossification, neonatal growth and survival rate were seen among the pups.",

    "320": "The norepinephrine (NE) and angiotensin II (A II) contents in the brain regions of SHR and WKY (Wistar Kyoto) rats at different ages were determined by fluorospectrophotometry and radioimmunoassay. The systolic blood pressure (SBP) of the rats was measured indirectly with a tail cuff technique in conscious state. The results were as follows: There was no significant difference in the central A II and NE contents between SHR and WKY rats at 8-week age. Since 12th week age the SBP of SHR has increased gradually, up to 16th to 20th week and then maintained steady level. Whereas there was no significant change of SBP in WKY rats in the same span of age. In the early and late states of hypertension the A II contents in the medulla oblongata, pons, hypothalamus and nucleus caudatus of SHR were markedly higher than those of the age-matched WKY rats. But the change of NE content of SHR in the early stage showed a different picture as compared with that of WKY rats, i.e., NE decreased in medulla oblongata and anterior hypothalamus but increased in pons, posterior hypothalamus and nucleus caudatus. However, in the late stage there was no such significant difference between SHR and WKY rats. Consequently, it is suggested that the central A II and NE participated in the development of hypertension of SHR, and that the maintenance of hypertension is mainly dependent upon the increased A II content. Microinjection of captopril or 6-OHDA in the lateral cerebroventricle of SHR elicited a decrease of BP and reduction of both A II and NE contents in the medulla and hypothalamus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "321": "The objective of this study was to investigate the changes of arterial baroreflex sensitivity (ABS) in one-kidney Grollman hypertensive rats. The blood pressure was altered with phenylephrine or sodium nitroprusside. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and pulse interval were recorded simultaneously and the MAP-pulse interval regression line was constructed. All rats were divided into three groups: Grollman-operation group, sham-operated group and normal group. ABS was determined at the 3rd week after operation. The results were as follows: The ABS of the Grollman hypertensive group was significantly lower than that of the sham-operated group (P less than 0.01). After i.v.c. injection of 150 micrograms captopril the MAP of both groups are lowered, but more significantly in Grollman than in the sham-operated group (P less than 0.05, at 35 min after injection). From 35 to 60 min after injection, the MAP of the sham-operated group has practically reached a steady level while that of the Grollman group still shows significant tendency of decline. At 60th min, the ABS of the hypertensive was significantly increased than that measured 60 min before injection (P less than 0.05), while similar measurements for the sham-operated group showed only a slight or much less significant increase. MAP was increased and ABS was decreased by i.v.c. injection of 8 micrograms angiotension II in the normal group. The results of the present investigation indicate that ABS decreases during the development of one-kidney Grollman hypertensive rats, and that this change appears to be related to the increased concentration of angiotension II in the brain.",

Liver dysfunction has rarely been described. We present a 71-year-old man with an acute myocardial infarction who developed high fever and progressive disturbance of liver function tests, hepatocellular and cholestatic, after beginning captopril. When other, more likely causes for his condition were ruled out, captopril was discontinued and the fever and liver dysfunction then quickly resolved. We recommend periodic laboratory follow-up in patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "323": "The effects of captopril and of other angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (zofenopril, fosenopril and enalaprilic acid) were tested on the isolated rabbit heart and aorta. Captopril elicited an erratic negative inotropic effect and a reduction in basal coronary perfusion pressure (10(-5)-10(-4) M). The increase of coronary perfusion pressure induced by vasopressin, methoxamine, angiotensin II and Bay K 8644 was partially antagonized by captopril (10(-7)-10(-4) M) in a non-specific manner. These actions were not modified by saralasin or indomethacin and by ex vivo pretreatment with captopril itself. On the aortic strips, the contraction plateau induced by KCl and angiotensin II was partially inhibited (10(-6)-10(-4) M), while no effect was observed on those induced by noradrenaline, serotonin and PGF2 alpha. The Ca2+ concentration-response curve appeared shifted to the right in a non-competitive manner. The other angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors showed no effect up to 10(-4) M on isolated heart or aorta. Results obtained with captopril were consistent with vasorelaxant activity independent of the tissue renin-angiotensin system. Modulatory activity on the intracellular calcium movement may be involved.", 
    "324": "We studied changes in cortisol, aldosterone, progesterone, estrogens and cholesterol in cyclic female guinea-pigs and in animals under contraceptive, treated or not with an inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE): perindopril. Perindopril decreased ACE by 80% without affecting steroid profiles. Peak value for plasma progesterone occurred at meta-estrus and diestrus. It disappeared under contraceptive treatment. The very low levels of estrogens in the female guinea pig remained unchanged in all cases. Plasma cortisol concentrations were higher at pro-estrus and estrus whereas plasma aldosterone concentrations remained constant during the estrous cycle and under contraceptive treatment. Furthermore, aldosterone did not change under perindopril treatment despite the decrease of the activity of ACE. The contraceptive treatment decreased plasma cholesterol levels. Under perindopril treatment, this drop was amplified. No change was detected in adrenal steroid concentrations, except for progesterone which decreased under contraceptive treatment.", 
    "325": "Ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) monitoring was used to evaluate the 24-h antihypertensive efficacy of single- and repeat-dose administrations of the nonsulfhydryl-converting enzyme inhibitor cilazapril, 2.5 and 5 mg, versus placebo in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. After a 2-week placebo run-in period, patients were randomized to receive, in a double-blind procedure, either 2.5 mg cilazapril (n = 14), 5 mg cilazapril (n = 14), or placebo (n = 14) for 4 weeks. In calculating the systolic/diastolic blood pressure (BP) trough-to-peak (T/P) ratio after subtraction of the placebo effect, 5 mg cilazapril appeared to be more effective than 2.5 mg cilazapril following single- (59/54% vs. 21/48%) and repeat-dose administration (47/76% vs. 31/49%). There were significant differences in 24-h and awake ABP for both 2.5 and 5 mg cilazapril as compared to placebo after single- and repeat-dose administrations. However, there were no significant differences in 24-h and awake ABP reduction between 2.5 and 5 mg cilazapril after single- and repeat-dose administrations. Furthermore, the percentages of \"BP load\" were identical with both regimens after the first dose (46 vs. 43%) and at steady-state (37 vs. 29%). These data demonstrate that 2.5 and 5 mg doses of cilazapril have equivalent antihypertensive efficacy using ABP and that 24-h ABP monitoring should also be performed in dose-response studies.", 
    "326": "We have studied the effect of ramipril (10 mg/kg daily by gastric gavage) on the development of neointima 2 and 14 days after injury to rat aorta with a balloon catheter. In treated animals, there was no significant inhibition of the early mitotic reaction after injury (synthesis of DNA, as reflected by aortic thymidine incorporation on the second day): the mean (95% confidence interval) was 3,553 (892) in the control group vs. 2,853 disintegrations/min/micrograms of DNA (555) in the treated group, 2 p greater than 0.15. However, ramipril decreased the amount of neointima formed 14 days after injury, as characterized by (a) a highly significant decrease of the intima to intima + media areas ratio [21.1 (2.4) vs. 13.7% (2.2), 2 p less than 10(-4]); (b) a significant decrease of intima-media wet weight [35.4 (1.0) vs. 30.9 mg (0.9), 2p less than 0.005]; and (c) without any significant effect on intima-media DNA content [96.3 (7.9) vs. 91.7 micrograms (5.7), 2p greater than 0.3]. These observations suggest that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors may not act mainly through an inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation. Other effects, such as inhibition of migration, hypertrophy, and matrix synthesis, should also be considered.", 
    "327": "The aim of the present study was to look for possible additive or synergistic effects of the combined oral administration of a single dose of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, benazepril (10 mg) (B), and a long-acting vasodilator, cadralazine (5 mg) (C), on blood pressure, arterial parameters, and active plasma renin. The study was carried out in eight normotensive subjects according to a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover design. Blood pressure (BP), heart rate, humeral artery diameter (D), carotid-femoral pulse-wave velocity (PWV), finger-pulse ratio (FPR), and plasma active renin (PAR) were measured at baseline and every 2 h over 8 h. A significant treatment effect was observed for supine and tilted BP, FPR, PWV, and PAR. The largest decrease in supine systolic and diastolic BP was observed with the combination (10.0 +/- 6.9/7.2 +/- 3.7 mm Hg). Six hours after drug intake, the mean changes in FPR were 0.05 +/- 0.24 (P), -0.06 +/- 0.30 (C), 0.13 +/- 0.32 (B), and 0.28 +/- 0.34 (B + C), and the mean changes in PWV were 0.14 +/- 0.66 m/s (P), 0.09 +/- 0.54 m/s (C), -0.29 +/- 0.50 m/s (B), and -0.55 +/- 0.48 m/s (B + C). PAR was more markedly augmented with the combination of the two drugs (142 +/- 40 pg/ml) than with benazepril alone (90 +/- 62 pg/ml). It was concluded that a single noneffective dose of a vasodilator administered together with an ACE inhibitor in normotensives can lower blood pressure and increase arterial compliance and plasma active renin.",

Independent of their symptomatic benefits, diuretics, digitalis, ACE inhibitors, PDE inhibitors and dopamine agonists exert specific influences on factors that retard or accelerate progression of congestive heart failure (CHF). Important factors that indicate or promote progression of CHF are discussed here, with special emphasis on therapeutic options. Interference with baroreceptor function (digitalis, ACE inhibitors), the RAA system (ACE inhibitors), the sympathetic nerve system (dopamine agonists, ACE inhibitors, digitalis) can potentially retard progression of CHF, while other therapeutic options, such as PDE inhibitors and diuretics, might accelerate progression of left ventricular dysfunction and CHF.",

Bimane peptides containing nitrated amino acid (1a, b) were shown to be useful fluorogenic substrates for the assay of angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) from rabbit lung, similar to bimane substrate containing tryptophan (3) previously reported. Among these bimane substrates, substrate 3 was shown to be a potent fluorogenic substrate for microdetermination of the ACE level in human serum.", 
    "330": "The present studies assessed the nature of the recognition site for [3H]ceranapril in tissue from rat and human brain. [3H]Ceranapril exhibited high affinity saturable specific (defined by 1 microM captopril) binding to homogenates of tissue from both rat and human brain (mean pKd values between 8.42 and 8.69). High binding densities were observed in rat striatum and homogenates of tissue from human caudate (Bmax values 3317 +/- 192 and 1900 +/- 110 fmol/mg protein respectively), with comparatively low densities in cortical tissues. In kinetic experiments, association of [3H]ceranapril to homogenates of rat and human cortex was found to be rapid and fully reversible (K+1 = 6 x 10(5) M-1 sec-1 and 2.4 x 10(6) M-1 sec-1, K-1 = 7.6 x 10(-3) sec-1 and 4.5 x 10(-3) sec-1 respectively). In competition studies, lisinopril, captopril, unlabelled ceranapril, epicaptopril and fosinopril, all competed to a similar extent and with similar rank order of potency for the binding of [3H]ceranapril to homogenates of both rat and human brain. In in vivo studies, pretreatment of rats with either captopril or lisinopril (15 micrograms/250 g) significantly reduced the content of tritium in brain, as measured 20 min after intravenous administration of [3H]ceranapril. From these experiments [3H]ceranpril appears to selectively label, with high affinity, the inhibitor binding site of angiotensin converting enzyme and this site appears to be similar in both species studied.", 
    "331": "In the kidney, angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) is present in the vascular endothelial cells and in the brush border of epithelial cells of the proximal tubule. In spite of this well-known distribution of ACE, little is known of its regulation. In order to elucidate the possible mechanisms of control for brush border ACE, the effects of dexamethasone (DM), (40 micrograms s.c. per day, for 7 days) and triiodothyronine (T3) 0.5 mg/kg s.c. per day, for 10 days) were investigated in male Wistar rats. Plasma and brush border ACE activities were measured by fluorimetry in the presence of an artificial substrate Cbz-Phe-His-Leu and brush border ACE was characterized with a binding assay using 3H-ramiprilat, a specific radiolabelled ACE inhibitor. DM elicited a significant decrease in plasma ACE activity (from 0.46 +/- 0.03 to 0.28 +/- 0.02 nmol His-Leu/min/mg protein) but did not alter enzyme activity in the brush border: 47.12 +/- 5.12 nmol His-Leu/min/mg protein (control, n = 6) and 47.78 +/- 5.63 (DM, n = 6). Administering T3 produced a marked increase in the brush border ACE activity (from 42.87 +/- 4.9 to 81.41 +/- 11.7 nmol His-Leu/min/mg protein). Similarly, the maximum number of 3H-ramiprilat-binding sites increased in the brush border, indicating a good correlation between ACE activity and the quantity of 3H-ramiprilat bound. Thus, the variation in tissue ACE activity corresponded to a change in the enzyme concentration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "332": "1. The transpulmonary pharmacokinetics of the intravenous diacid ACE inhibitor perindoprilat were studied in 10 male patients undergoing diagnostic cardiac catheterisation for the management of ischaemic heart disease. 2. Following successful completion of diagnostic cardiac catheterisation and ventriculography, subjects received a low dose (1 mg) constant rate infusion of perindoprilat over 20 min with co-infusion of the intravenous marker dye indocyanine green (0.5 mg kg-1). Simultaneous transpulmonary blood sampling was conducted for 1 h and subsequent peripheral venous blood samples were collected for 20 h. 3. No acute changes in blood pressure or heart rate were noted despite rapid and marked inhibition of central circulation plasma ACE activity persisting in peripheral venous blood for 20 h. A delayed rise in plasma renin activity was noted. 4. Transpulmonary passage during early accumulation of the drug was seen to incorporate an early delay. Concurrent ICG measurements suggested that this was entirely due to circulatory delay and not to binding of the drug. Thus, despite the suggested high concentration of tissue ACE activity in the pulmonary circulation, transpulmonary passage of perindoprilat was not measurably influenced by binding at this site under the conditions studied.", 
    "333": "1 Perindopril is a prodrug which is hydrolysed in vivo to the active metabolite perindoprilat, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Perindoprilat glucuronide is also found in plasma. 2 The pharmacokinetics of perindopril and its metabolites were studied after administration of a single 4 mg dose to hypertensive patients with various degrees of renal failure. 3 The absorption and elimination of perindopril were not influenced by the degree of renal failure. 4 The mean area under the serum concentration-time curve of the active metabolite perindoprilat increased from 93 ng ml-1 h in subjects with normal renal function to 1106 ng ml-1 in patients with severe renal failure, whereas its half-life varied from 5.0 to 27.4 h. 5 In the same subjects, the mean area under the curve of perindoprilat glucuronide increased from 78 to 513 ng ml-1 h, while its half-life varied from 1.8 h to 7.7 h. 6 Perindopril, perindoprilat, and perindoprilat glucuronide were dialysable. 7 The extent and duration of serum angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition was augmented in renal failure. The mean area under the inhibition time curve (extrapolated to infinity) increased from 2490%.h in subjects with normal renal function to 42241 %.h in patients with severe renal impairment. The half-life of inhibition varied from 12.1 h to 100.4 h. This effect of renal failure on the pharmacodynamics of perindoprilat was more pronounced than its influence on perindoprilat kinetics. 8 In view of the important influence of renal impairment on the elimination and action of the active substance perindoprilat, a dosage reduction of perindopril is proposed in in patients with renal failure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "334": "1. Kinin analogues bradykinin (BK), T-kinin, Met-Lys-BK, Lys-Lys-BK, Des-Arg9-BK with agonist activity and D-Arg0-Hyp3-Thi5,8-D-Phe7-BK (DAHTDBK) and Arg9-Leu8-BK with antagonist activity were injected into the posterior portion of the fourth cerebral ventricle of unanaesthetized rats implanted with permanent cannulae and arterial pressure was measured directly from the abdominal aorta. 2. The spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were more sensitive than normotensive Wistar rats (NWR) to the pressor effect of BK and other kinin analogues. The SHR did not differ in sensitivity of the pressor response to centrally administered angiotensin II or endothelin-1. 3. Experiments with selective kinin agonists and antagonists revealed that in the SHR, as in the NWR, the receptors which mediated the central pressor response are of the BK2 subtype. 4. Measurements of the pressor activity of kinins with different degrees of susceptibility to degradation, as well as experiments with kininase inhibitors, enalaprilat and CPP-Ala-Ala-Phe-pAB, suggest that the kininase activity in the central nervous system of SHR is reduced in comparison to that of NWR. 5. The SHR also showed increased sensitivity to BK and Lys-Lys-BK, compared with the NWR, when the kinins were injected following the administration of a mixture of the kininase inhibitors, suggesting that mechanisms other than kininase activity may play a role in the increased sensitivity of the SHR to the central pressor action of kinins. 6. An in vivo characterization of the kinin receptors which mediate the central pressor response showed that the interaction with DAHTDBK was reversible and of competitive nature. The pA2 in vivo estimated for the kinin receptors of the SHR was 0.7 logarithm units larger than that obtained in the NWR. 7. The kinin receptors which mediate the central BK pressor effect in the SHR are of the BK2 subtype and are similar to receptors in the NWR. The increased sensitivity to kinins in the SHR may be explained, at least in part, by their decreased kininase activity. At present it is impossible to conclude whether the difference observed in the pA2 represents an increased affinity of the kinin receptors or can be attributed to differences amongst strains in the enzymatic degradation of the antagonist.", 
    "335": "Murine schistosomiasis is usually associated with hepatic granulomatous lesions together with high serum and granuloma angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity. Praziquantel (PRZ) which is known to reduce granuloma size was studied to show whether this effect is related to changes in ACE activity. Furthermore, captopril was studied to show whether by inhibiting ACE activity, the drug could also affect granuloma size. PRZ, captopril, and their combination led to significant reduction in liver granuloma. However, in normal mice, captopril was shown to increase rather than decrease serum ACE. The decrease in ACE activity by PRZ was correlated with its curative effect in infected mice. However, in experimentally induced pulmonary granulomata, the drug reduced granuloma size without affecting ACE activity of either serum or granuloma. It may be concluded that reduction in ACE activity may be beneficial as far as diminution of granuloma size is concerned and irrespective of whether there is an active infection or not. The possible use of Captopril as an antihypertensive in bilharzial infections associated with hypertension would probably not adversely affect the granulomatous lesions.", 
    "336": "To determine whether angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition may reduce the incidence of restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), we retrospectively identified 322 consecutive patients who underwent a successful procedure from June 1988 to December 1989. No patients developed chest pain, ST segment elevation, positive cardiac enzymes, or other evidence of abrupt vessel closure following the PTCA. All patients received intravenous heparin after PTCA and aspirin was begun on the day prior to PTCA. Patients were separated into two groups: those at hospital discharge incidentally treated for hypertension or heart failure with ACE inhibitors (n = 36), and those treated with a drug regimen which did not include ACE inhibitors (n = 286). The two groups were similar with respect to age (61 +/- 13.5 vs. 60 +/- 12.5, p = NS) and other demographic characteristics. Restenosis, defined as the presentation to a physician with symptoms of angina within 6 months of the PTCA and the finding on repeat catheterization of a significant restenosis at the site of the PTCA, occurred in 30% of the patients who were discharged on a drug regimen which did not include ACE inhibitors vs. 3% (p less than .05) in those treated with an ACE inhibitor. Thus, it appears that the use of ACE inhibitors may significantly reduce the incidence of restenosis after successful PTCA.", 
    "337": "In a multicenter, parallel, double-blind study, lisinopril, a new converting enzyme inhibitor, was compared with atenolol in the treatment of mild to moderate essential hypertension. Four hundred ninety patients were randomized to once-a-day treatment with lisinopril 20 mg or atenolol 50 mg for 4 weeks, and the doses of lisinopril or atenolol were increased at 4-week intervals up to 80 mg or 200 mg, respectively, if sitting diastolic blood pressure (SDBP) was not well controlled. Lisinopril and atenolol reduced SDBP to a similar extent. All reductions from baseline in sitting diastolic and systolic blood pressure were significant (p less than 0.01). Lisinopril produced a significantly greater reduction (p less than 0.01) in sitting systolic blood pressure (SSBP) than atenolol. The predominant reduction in SSBP could not be explained on the basis of age, race, or severity of hypertension. It is suggested that the increase in arterial compliance reported for converting enzyme inhibitors could explain the predominant decrease in systolic blood pressure.", 
    "338": "We have previously reported that antioxidant drug intervention protects against magnesium deficiency-induced myocardial lesions. In the present study, Golden Syrian male hamsters were fed either a magnesium-deficient diet or a magnesium-supplemented diet. Animals from each group received sulfhydryl-containing angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors: captopril, epi-captopril (a stereoisomer of captopril), and zofenopril* (arginine blend of zofenopril containing a free SH group); another group of animals received the non-sulfhydryl-containing angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalaprilat. The animals were killed after 14 days, and their hearts were isolated for morphological and morphometric analyses. Hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections were examined by a computer image analysis system for a morphometric determination of the severity of myocardial injury. Captopril reduced both the density of lesions, from 0.32 to 0.08 lesions/(mm2) (p less than 0.01), and the area fraction of lesions, from 7.42 x 10(-4) to 2.03 x 10(-4) lesion area/(mm2) (p less than 0.01), as well as the degree of inflammatory infiltration around the blood vessels. Epi-captopril and zofenopril* were virtually equipotent to captopril, but enalaprilat afforded only slight (nonsignificant) protection. These results indicate that a significant component of the protective effect of captopril in this model was attributable to its sulfhydryl moiety, rather than solely due to the inhibition of the angiotensin converting enzyme. These data further support our previous findings of possible free radical participation in cardiomyopathy due to magnesium deficiency.", 
    "339": "Hypertension is associated with an impairment of endothelium-dependent relaxation. The angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors captopril and cilazapril can prevent this endothelial dysfunction. We recently observed that long-term treatment with cilazapril could also prevent subendothelial infiltration by mononuclear cells in spontaneously hypertensive rats. This prompted us to examine whether, in spontaneously hypertensive rats, endothelial dysfunction and subendothelial infiltration by mononuclear cells are associated. These cells were characterized as monocyte macrophages. Infiltration by monocyte macrophages was quantified by morphometry. Endothelial function was estimated by calculating serotonin ratio (maximal contraction to serotonin on isolated arterial rings with endothelium over maximal contraction on paired rings without endothelium). The regional distribution of endothelial dysfunction and subendothelial monocyte macrophages was similar. Both were maximal in the carotid artery, less in the aorta, and nonexistent in the renal artery. A 2-week treatment with cilazapril decreased both endothelial dysfunction (serotonin ratio decreased by 32%) and the number of subendothelial monocyte macrophages in the aorta, which decreased by 38%. We conclude that in spontaneously hypertensive rats, endothelial dysfunction and subendothelial monocyte macrophage infiltration are associated and that cilazapril can decrease both. The observation that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors affect subendothelial accumulation of monocyte macrophage may lead to a better understanding of the mechanism of action of this class of drugs.", 
    "340": "Isolated glomeruli from rats with bilateral ureteral obstruction (BUO) of 24-h duration produced significantly greater amounts of prostaglandin (PG) E2 and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha in vitro than glomeruli from sham-operated control (SOC) rats. This increase was abolished by the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, enalaprilat, given in vivo. To elucidate the mechanisms responsible for enhanced eicosanoid production by glomeruli from rats with BUO, we measured the activities of phospholipase (PL) A2 and C and cyclooxygenase in glomeruli isolated from SOC and BUO rats. L-alpha-Phosphatidylcholine (PC)-specific and L-alpha-phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)-specific PLA2 activities were significantly greater in glomerular membranes from rats with BUO than from SOC rats. Likewise, both the activity and amount of cyclooxygenase were significantly greater in glomerular membranes of rats with BUO. Cyclooxygenase and the PE-specific PLA2 in glomerular membranes of rats with BUO remained at the levels seen in SOC rats when animals were treated in vivo before BUO with the ACE inhibitor, enalaprilat, and the thromboxane synthase inhibitor, OKY-046. Thus inhibition of vasoconstrictor formation leads to subsequent inhibition of vasodilator formation. In contrast to PE-specific PLA2, PC-specific PLA2 activities were further increased in glomerular membranes from both SOC and BUO rats pretreated with the two drugs.s The activity of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-specific phospholipase C (PIP2 PLC) was significantly decreased in glomeruli from rats with BUO compared with SOC rats. We conclude that the increased synthesis of vasodilatory eicosanoids by glomeruli from rats with BUO may be mediated by enhanced activities of PE-specific PLA2 and cyclooxygenase, which are apparently stimulated by the vasoconstrictors angiotensin and thromboxane.", 
    "341": "In a double-blind randomized crossover study of 10 patients with mild essential hypertension, the influence of antihypertensive treatment with the angiotensin-I converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril (a single dose of 10 mg.day-1) on submaximal endurance exercise performance at a work rate eliciting a heart rate of 150 beats/min was studied. Resting and exercise blood pressure were significantly reduced during enalapril therapy. Heart rate was unaffected. Submaximal endurance exercise performance was reduced by 12% (p = 0.06). Plasma lactate concentrations were significantly increased and serum nonesterified fatty acid concentrations were decreased during exercise in patients receiving enalapril treatment. Plasma glucose and potassium levels and serum glycerol concentrations were not influenced by enalapril treatment. Because the impairment of endurance performance during enalapril treatment is relatively small compared with the reductions caused by other antihypertensive agents, such as beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents or diuretics, it is of minor clinical importance for most physically active patients with hypertension.",

However, for patients receiving converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI) therapy, the spectrophotometric method showed much greater suppression of plasma ACE activity than did the fluorometric method. To determine which of the two methods provided a more reliable indication of ACE inhibition in vivo, we measured plasma ACE, angiotensin I (ANG I), and angiotensin II (ANG II) in patients receiving the CEI perindopril. During perindopril therapy, changes in the ratio of ANG II:ANG I, an index of ACE activity in vivo, showed a close agreement with changes in plasma ACE activity measured with FAPGG as substrate, but not with HHL as substrate. We conclude that measurement of ACE activity in vitro with FAPGG as substrate provides a reliable measure of changes in conversion of ANG I to ANG II in vivo during CEI therapy.", 
    "343": "In addition to angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE; EC 3.4.15.1) and carboxypeptidase N (CPN; EC 3.4.17.3), other peptidases contribute to bradykinin (BK) degradation in plasma. Rat plasma degraded BK by hydrolysis of the N-terminal Arg1-Pro2 bond, and the characteristics of hydrolysis are consistent with identification of aminopeptidase P (APP; EC 3.4.11.9) as the responsible enzyme. BK and BK[1-5] N-terminal hydrolysis was optimal at neutral pH, was inhibited by 2-mercaptoethanol, dithiothreitol, o-phenanthroline and EDTA, but was unaffected by the aminopeptidase inhibitors amastatin, puromycin and diprotin A, the endopeptidase-24.11 inhibitors phosphoramidon and ZINCOV, and the ACE and CPN inhibitors captopril and D,L-mercapto-methyl-3-guanidinoethylthiopropanoic acid (MERGETPA), respectively. Although kallidin (Lys-BK) was not metabolized directly by APP, conversion to BK by plasma aminopeptidase M (EC 3.4.11.2) resulted in subsequent degradation by APP. BK analogs containing N-terminal Arg1-Pro2 bonds, including [Tyr8-(OMe)] BK and [Phe8 psi(CH2NH)Arg9]BK (B2 agonists), des-Arg9-BK and [D-Phe8]des-Arg9-BK (B1 agonists), and [Leu8]des-Arg9-BK (B1 antagonist), were degraded by APP with Km and Vmax values comparable to those found for BK (Km = 19.7 +/- 2.6 microM; Vmax = 12.1 +/- 1.2 nmol/min/mL). In contrast, B2 antagonists containing D-Arg0 N-termini, including D-Arg[Hyp3,Thi5.8,D-Phe7]BK and D-Arg[Hyp3,D-Phe7,Phe8 psi(CH2NH)Arg9]BK, were resistant to APP-mediated hydrolysis. These data support a role for plasma aminopeptidase P in the degradation of circulating kinins, and a variety of B2 and B1 kinin agonists and antagonists. However, APP does not participate in the degradation of D-Arg0-containing antagonists.",

Previous metal analyses of somatic ACE have indicated a zinc stoichiometry of 1 mol of Zn2+/mol of ACE and inhibitor-binding studies have found 1 mol of inhibitor bound/mol of enzyme. These and other data have indicated that only one of the two domains of somatic ACE is catalytically active. We have repeated the metal and inhibitor-binding analyses of ACE from various sources and have determined protein concentration by quantitative amino acid analysis on the basis of accurate polypeptide molecular weights that are now available. We find that the somatic isozyme in fact contains 2 mol of Zn2+ and binds 2 mol of lisinopril (an ACE inhibitor) per mol of enzyme, whereas the testis isozyme contains 1 mol of Zn2+ and binds 1 mol of lisinopril. In the case of somatic ACE, the second equivalent of inhibitor binds to a second zinc-containing site as evidenced by the ability of a moderate excess of inhibitor to protect both zinc ions against dissociation. However, active site titration with lisinopril assayed by hydrolysis of furanacryloyl-Phe-Gly-Gly revealed that 1 mol of inhibitor/mol of enzyme abolished the activity of either isozyme, indicating that the principal angiotensin-converting site likely resides in the C-terminal (testicular) domain of somatic ACE and that binding of inhibitor to this site is stronger than to the second site.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "353": "Chronic cor pulmonale is defined as right heart hypertrophy or right ventricular dilatation and/or chronic right heart failure. There are many etiologies which largely determine mortality and drug therapy, but the common cause is increased right ventricular work from primary or secondary pulmonary hypertension assuming two prototypes, the asphyxial and the vascular obliterative type. The main focus of this review concentrates on the various drugs to reduce pulmonary vascular pressure and resistance. The value to correct hypoxaemia is mentioned with regard to its demonstrated important effect of asthmatic patients with cor pulmonale. Continuous oxygen therapy and a potential therapy by almitrine, a respiratory stimulant, have been suggested. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors and dopaminergic drugs have been used successfully to improve right cardiac function in a small number of patients. The use of prostacyclin has a large potential to effectively correct pulmonary vascular haemodynamics but its use is fairly limited by the need of continuous intravenous application. New oral drugs under investigation which stimulate endogenous prostacyclin as well as thromboxane synthetase inhibitors still need further evaluation but might be of potential benefit. The comparison of the side-effects due to vasodilators and calcium antagonists argues for the use of calcium channel blockade for patients with pulmonary hypertension. To define the role of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or the more recently introduced potassium channel openers for treatment of chronic cor pulmonale still await detailed, controlled studies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "363": "These experiments were designed to test the hypothesis that the antihypertensive action of the converting enzyme inhibitor captopril in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats is associated with an inhibition of norepinephrine release from peripheral sympathetic neurons. Radiotracer techniques were used to measure norepinephrine clearance and spillover rate into plasma. A single 30 mg/kg (s.c.) dose of captopril elevated norepinephrine spillover rate by 20 to 25 and 45 to 60% at 0.5- and 2-hr postinjection, respectively. At 2-hr postinjection, captopril (10 and 30 mg/kg s.c.) produced a dose-related fall in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and dose-related increase in norepinephrine spillover rate. The 30-mg/kg dose was more effective in decreasing MAP when given s.c. as compared to i.v. dosing. When equivasodepressor doses of captopril, hydralazine and prazosin were compared at 2-hr postinjection, the increases in norepinephrine spillover rate produced by captopril (44%) and hydralazine (68%) were not different. However, prazosin elevated norepinephrine spillover rate by 137%. Norepinephrine clearance was not altered by captopril. When MAP was lowered to the same extent (-17 to -23%) by 5 days of continuous treatment with captopril, enalaprilat and minoxidil, the increases in norepinephrine spillover rate (50-65%) were not different in the three treatment groups. In conclusion, these data do not support the hypothesis that captopril lowers blood pressure by inhibiting the neuronal release of norepinephrine.", 
    "364": "It has long been realized that hypertension causes alterations in the peripheral vasculature, with the arterial wall becoming thicker and the lumen relatively smaller. This is particularly true in small resistance arteries, but larger vessels are also affected. The precise mechanisms remain to be determined, although it is highly likely that growth-promoting autacoids are involved as well as mechanical forces. Numerous studies of hypertension in animal models and a few in hypertensive humans have tried to establish the reversibility of these changes after successful lowering of blood pressure. Too few data are available to form firm conclusions, but thiazides and hydralazine-like vasodilators appear to have only a minimal effect on the vasculature. On the other hand, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are clearly effective, and alpha-blockers may be active. However, it is difficult to derive even tentative conclusions from the available information on calcium antagonists and beta-blockers. These results are discussed in the context of future therapeutic and investigative approaches.", 
    "365": "We conducted a systematic search of the world literature up to January 1, 1990 on the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors for treatment of hypertension during pregnancy. A total of 25 publications reported 85 pregnancies in 81 women, including three twin pregnancies. Captopril had been used in 49, enalapril in 35, and both drugs in one of these pregnancies. The number of unbiased data are too limited to permit firm conclusions on teratogenicity, if any, of these agents. Contrary to earlier suggestions, we found no evidence that the use of these agents increases the likelihood of low weight for gestational age, respiratory distress syndrome, and/or persistent ductus arteriosus. Use of these agents in pregnancy can cause severe disturbance of fetal and neonatal renal function, such as oligohydramnios, pulmonary hypoplasia, and long-lasting neonatal anuria. Although the true incidence of these perinatal problems cannot be derived from the type of data hitherto available, there are strong suggestions that renal dysfunction is more common with the use of enalapril than with captopril. The frequency of serious perinatal complications is high enough to warrant extreme reluctance in prescribing angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors during pregnancy.", 
    "366": "The purpose of this study was to establish the molecular mechanism whereby captopril prevents the formation of active oxygen species, since many studies have provided evidence that postischemic myocardial dysfunction is mediated, at least in part, by the generation of these agents. Results indicate that captopril is a potent inhibitor of certain reactions mediated by O2-. However, this interference of captopril was not understood as an scavenging activity against the free radicals generated. The data could be explained by considering a direct interaction of captopril with the metal ions present that catalyse the formation of O2-. This mechanism could be of biological relevance.", 
    "367": "The study included 15 patients with nephrogenic hypertension of various genesis. 13 of them had unilateral disease, 2 bilateral one.

The blood for renin and prostaglandin quantitation was obtained from the renal veins and infrarenal portion of the vena cava inferior. The results show that in unilateral renal lesions prostaglandin E secretion on the affected side was significantly lower than on the contralateral side (p less than 0.05). Plasma renin activity in 3 patients with a contracted kidney was significantly lower on the affected side (p less than 0.05), though the rest 10 patients were reported to exhibit opposite results. No significant relationships occurred in the levels of prostaglandins I2, F2 alpha, thromboxane A2.

The absolute configuration of the alpha-carbon where the phosphonic acid is attached was determined unequivocally by referring to the L-isoleucyl moiety whose absolute configuration is known. The conformation of the molecule is relatively rigid owing to the intramolecular requisites and the resultant relative disposition of hetero atoms, which are necessary to its biological activities, are confined to the corresponding disposition in captopril.", 
    "369": "The effects of the simultaneous steady-state intravenous infusion of benazeprilat, the active metabolite of benazepril HCl, and angiotensin I (AI) on mean arterial blood pressure were investigated in the conscious, unrestrained spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) and its normotensive parent strain, the Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rat. A competitive inhibition model is applied and the limits of its validity are discussed. Deviations from the model are apparent at high drug infusion rates and may relate to the effect of benazeprilat on the clearance of AI. The strains differ in the amounts of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) or responsiveness to angiotensin II (AII), the drug clearances, and either the pharmacology or the distribution of the drug. Since the latter two differences are drug dependent, prediction between strains is rendered difficult. This steady-state approach relates the hypertension in the SHR to the amount of ACE or responsiveness to AII and renal function.", 
    "370": "The paper confirms the value of captopril in a sample group of 20 elderly patients (mean age 72.9 years) affected by overall cardiac decompensation in more or less clinically evident phases. All patients were randomly selected and received ACE-inhibition treatment for six months; doses of 25 mg or 50 mg captopril were given twice a day and all other drugs were suspended except for digitalis which was used by all patients without success. During the course of the trial the most important clinical results were the reduction of systemic blood pressure due to the diminution of peripheral resistance, the reduction of postload and ventricular filling pressure, and the consequent improvement of cardiac decompensation. All elderly patients treated in this manner experienced a stable improvement in the quality of life, with a considerable reduction in the consumption of diuretics to which they are particularly vulnerable. Following a broad ranging comparison with other reports, the Authors conclude that captopril is a geriatric drug which should be used as early as possible during the phases of latent cardiac insufficiency or at the first signs of a hypertensive crisis.", 
    "371": "The effect of 45 or 60 degrees head-up tilt on plasma arginine vasopressin (AVP) concentration, mean arterial pressure, and heart rate was studied in inactin-anesthetized rats. In all rats, there was a fall in blood pressure that was maximal within about 20-40 s and then returned toward normal. After 45 degrees head-up tilt for 30 min, AVP was increased from 7.0 +/- 1.7 to 21.0 +/- 5.9 pg/ml. Sixty-degree head-up tilt increased AVP at 5, 15, and 30 min, respectively, from 10.6 +/- 2.9 to 22.1 +/- 4.8 pg/ml, from 10.6 +/- 2.5 to 28.5 +/- 5.3, and from 16.1 +/- 4.7 to 62.6 +/- 10.3 pg/ml. After bilateral cervical vagotomy, 60 degrees head-up tilt for 30 min increased AVP, but the change was significantly reduced compared to intact animals. Bilateral sinoaortic denervation increased basal values of AVP, and there was no further increase during tilt. Bilateral electrolytic lesions of the hypothalamic paraventricular nuclei caused only a moderate reduction in the AVP response to tilt. When the effect of endogenous angiotensin II was antagonized by saralasin or its production was blocked by enalapril, the AVP response to tilt was reduced. The mean arterial pressure fell during the 1st min, but recovered rapidly when rats treated with a V1 vasopressin receptor antagonist were tilted. The data indicate that head-up tilt increases AVP secretion in anesthetized rats, that the response is mediated by the vagus and particularly by the arterial baroreceptors, and that circulating angiotensin II contributes to the response. However, the increased circulating AVP is not necessary for the maintenance of arterial pressure.", 
    "372": "Rheum, a well known herb unique in its cathartic effect is now introduced to prevent progression of uremia. A clinical prospective trial was conducted to evaluate its effect in comparison with the Captopril. 30 cases with initial Scr level of 344.8 +/- 114.0 mumol/L were allocated randomly to 3 groups. Rheum E treated group, Captopril treated group and Rheum E + Captopril group. The long term (6-22 mos) follow-up results showed that the progression rate of renal failure, calculated by regression analysis of 1/Scr vs time, was found to be retarded after treatment, being more marked in both Rheum E and Rheum E + Captopril group. Uremic symptoms improved after the treatment with serum albumin level increased. To explore the mechanism of therapeutic effects of Rheum on CRF, a series of experimental studies were performed. Rheum can suppress the proliferation of glomerular mesangial cells in culture. In 5/6 nephrectomized rats, the O2 consumption of remnant kidney was obviously decreased by feeding the animal Rheum E and the hypermetabolic state was ameliorated as well. A group of 5/6 nephrectomized rats were fed with Rheum E for 28 wks. It was found that the level of azotemia of this treated group was lessened remarkably as compared with the controls. The serum albumin and transferrin contents of the treated animals were much higher than the controls while the blood cholesterol and triglycerides decreased unexpectedly. In conclusion, both the in vivo and in vitro studies have proved the effectiveness of Rheum in preventing the progression of CRF.", 
    "373": "A number of studies based on animal models of both diabetes and renal insufficiency have shown that adequately reducing blood pressure attenuates the progression of glomerulosclerosis and decreases urinary protein excretion. Furthermore, compared with conventional antihypertensive therapy, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors show a greater benefit in reducing these parameters. Nineteen published animal studies have investigated the effects of calcium antagonists on renal hemodynamics and glomerulosclerosis, but only three of them have evaluated the use of calcium antagonists with models of diabetes. Of six micropuncture studies based on a 1 5/6 nephrectomy model of renal insufficiency, five demonstrated reduced efferent arteriolar resistance, two showed reduced glomerular capillary pressure (PGC), and two showed significantly reduced proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis. Studies using nifedipine with both the unilaterally nephrectomized DOCA salt rat model and the 1 5/6 nephrectomy model demonstrated reduced proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis that was independent of reduced PGC. Two separate micropuncture studies of the spontaneously hypertensive rat model also found reduced efferent arteriolar resistance and PGC as well as proteinuria. Finally, studies of Dahl \"salt-sensitive\" rats showed an early decrease in glomerulosclerosis without a significant change in either proteinuria or glomerulosclerosis after five weeks. The results of eleven clinical studies of diabetic patients have been published; they showed divergent effects of calcium antagonists on renal function and urinary protein excretion. In the various animal models, the divergent renal hemodynamic and histologic effects reported for calcium antagonists may be largely due to the equality of blood pressure reduction, the varied baseline hemodynamic profiles, and the divergent status of the renin-angiotensin system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "375": "Renal blood flow (RBF) was measured in conscious rabbits while nonpregnant and during pregnancy using chronically implanted ultrasonic transit-time flow probes. The effects of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor meclofenamate (5 mg/kg) and the angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor captopril (5 mg/kg) on basal RBF and on RBF responses to systemic angiotensin II infusions (2.5-80 ng.kg-1.min-1) were determined. Basal RBF declined (P less than 0.001 to P less than 0.005) with meclofenamate by 9-16% in pregnant (n = 7) and by 10% in nonpregnant (n = 7) rabbits. Captopril increased (P less than 0.05 to P less than 0.01) RBF by 9-11% in pregnant (n = 5) and by 12% in nonpregnant (n = 5) rabbits. There was no effect of the vehicle (normal saline) on RBF. The reduction in RBF (% from baseline) in response to infused angiotensin II was attenuated in pregnant compared with nonpregnant rabbits. Pretreatment with meclofenamate enhanced the renal vasoconstrictor action of angiotensin II in a similar fashion in both pregnant and nonpregnant rabbits. Captopril or saline did not alter the RBF responses to angiotensin II infusions. Mean arterial pressure was lower in pregnant (78 +/- 3 mmHg, n = 7) vs. nonpregnant (88 +/- 5 mmHg, n = 10) rabbits, suggesting lower total peripheral resistance. The data indicate 1) chronically implanted ultrasonic flow probes can be an effective tool for monitoring RBF in conscious rabbits, 2) prostaglandins and the renin-angiotensin system influence basal RBF in conscious rabbits, and 3) the renal vasoconstrictor effect of angiotensin II is blunted in pregnant rabbits and this attenuated response appears to be independent of prostaglandins.", 
    "376": "To examine the hemodynamic effects of benazepril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, in left ventricular failure, its active metabolite benazeprilat was administered during acute ischemic left ventricular failure in anesthetized open chest dog induced by repeated injections of plastic microspheres into the left coronary artery. The coronary embolization with microspheres resulted in a moderate and stable left ventricular pump failure characterized by increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and decreased cardiac output (CO). Benazeprilat (30 micrograms/kg) administered intravenously after a stabilization period lowered LVEDP and maintained CO. The total peripheral resistance was reduced with benazeprilat. The oxygen consumption and the coronary blood flow were reduced with benazeprilat because of a decrease in wall tension and afterload. These results suggest that benazeprilat (benazepril) has beneficial effects for the treatment of acute left ventricular failure.",

We studied 199 patients (108 M, 91 F) with mild to moderate essential hypertension whose BP was already controlled by the co-administration of C 25 mg and HCTZ 12.5 mg twice daily. They were randomly assigned to either C 25/HCTZ 12.5 twice daily during the first 6 weeks and C 50/HCTZ 25 once daily during the second 6 weeks or C 50/HCTZ 25 once daily followed by C 25/HCTZ 12.5 twice daily. Both regimens showed comparable efficacy on office diastolic BP (91.6 vs 91.3 mm Hg). Systolic BP was slightly but significantly higher (P = 0.02) with the once daily formulation (141.2 vs 139.1 mm Hg). Fixed combinations once daily and twice daily resulted in identical working ambulatory BP (133.7 +/- 13/83.6 +/- 8 mm Hg vs 132.4 +/- 11/83.3 +/- 7 mm Hg) without affecting heart rate. Adverse events were reported by 16% of patients and cough was the most common occurring in 7%. In conclusion, these results indicate that the fixed combination of C 50/HCTZ 25 given once daily controls office and working BP as well as the fixed combination C 25/HCTZ 12.5 given twice daily in patients with mild to moderate hypertension.", 
    "378": "Congestive heart failure is an increasingly common patient problem. It is a multisystem disease that involves not only the heart but also the kidneys and neurohormonal systems. Any treatment for heart failure should address depressed contractility and exercise intolerance, as well as control compensatory mechanisms. There are many different approaches to the treatment of congestive heart failure: among the drugs used are diuretics, digitalis compounds, nitrates, calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, beta-agonists, vasodilators, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and the new phosphodiesterase inhibitors. The therapy usually involves a multiple drug treatment plan to achieve the maximum effect for the patient with the lowest incidence of side effects. Heart failure involves a large spectrum of patients with left ventricular dysfunction, and success at achieving treatment goals with these patients will vary with the severity of that symptom. A major concern is that increasing contractility may further damage the myocardium and shorten the survival of these patients, although there is as yet no evidence of such shortening. The new phosphodiesterase inhibitor drugs are an exciting development in the treatment of heart failure, because they add a dimension to the treatment for patients who are not sufficiently improved by a regimen of digoxin, diuretics and ACE inhibitors. Any new heart failure medication should be able to improve rest and exercise haemodynamics, maintain its benefits when given orally and result in an improved exercise capacity and quality of life, and prolonged survival.", 
    "379": "The relation between the arteriolar diameters and hypertensive glomerulosclerosis was studied by using microvascular casts and histological evaluation. Spontaneously hypertensive rats 4 weeks of age were divided into three groups: nontreated, captopril (40 mg/kg/day)-treated, and trichlormethiazide (1 mg/kg/day) with hydralazine (20 mg/kg/day)-treated. Wistar-Kyoto rats served as controls. At 6 weeks old, the captopril-treated rats showed a lower blood pressure and a larger afferent arteriolar diameter compared with the control rats. At 20 weeks old, the nontreated group exhibited hypertension and a lower arteriolar diameter ratio (afferent to efferent, 0.89 versus 1.22 in control group) because of afferent constriction and efferent dilatation, seen equally in the outer and inner cortexes. Glomerulosclerosis was accentuated only in the inner cortex of the nontreated group (score, 63 versus 29 in control group). In the two treated rat groups, the blood pressure was reduced and arteriolar diameter ratios were similar to those in the control group (1.18 and 1.26). The sclerosis score in the trichlormethiazide with hydralazine-treated rats (score, 26) was lower than in the nontreated rats but not the captopril-treated rats (score, 36). These results indicated that 1) in the hypertensive rats, despite a reduced diameter ratio, glomerulosclerosis was more severe in the inner cortex; 2) two therapies reduced blood pressure and reversed the arteriolar changes, but a decrease in glomerulosclerosis was seen only in the trichlormethiazide with hydralazine-treated rats; and 3) for development of glomerulosclerosis, factors other than hemodynamics may be important in addition to intraglomerular pressure.",

They monitored their daily alcohol intake and attended biweekly assessments, but no other treatment or advice was given. Compliance and alcohol intake were verified objectively. Mean daily alcoholic drinks were not significantly different during 10 mg/day enalapril (mean +/- SEM, 7.5 +/- 0.5), and its placebo (7.2 +/- 0.5), but both decreased from baseline (8.1 +/- 0.5; both p less than 0.05). Similarly, mean daily drinks during 20 mg/day enalapril (6.8 +/- 0.6) and its placebo (7.2 +/- 0.4) was not significantly different, but both were lower than baseline (8.3 +/- 0.5; both p less than 0.01). Fourteen (64%) of the patients taking 20 mg/day enalapril decreased alcohol intake from placebo by an average of 21% (range, 1.6% to 78.3%). Self-ratings of interest, desire, craving, and liking for alcohol also decreased from baseline during enalapril and placebo treatments, but the effects of both were similar. Plasma renin activity increased, compared with placebo, after 10 mg/day enalapril (from 0.3 +/- 0.2 [mean +/- SD] to 1.9 +/- 1.5 ng/L/sec) and after 20 mg/day enalapril (from 0.4 +/- 0.3 to 2.8 +/- 4.0 ng/L/sec) (both p less than 0.05). Blood pressure decreased within a normotensive range, compared with placebo, with 10 mg/day enalapril (by 6.0 and 8.5 mm Hg systolic and diastolic blood pressures) and 20 mg/day enalapril (by 7.7 and 5.0 mm Hg, respectively). Side effects were few and mild. No patient characteristic or drug effect correlated with changes in alcohol intake. There were no significant variations in nonalcoholic beverages, cigarette smoking, or body weight. These results indicate that enalapril does not alter alcohol intake in normotensive alcoholics with normal plasma renin activity. Studies with higher doses of enalapril in humans may be limited by increased frequency and severity of side effects.",

Twenty male Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with 70% nitrous oxide in oxygen and fentanyl (10 micrograms x kg-1 i.v. bolus, 25 micrograms x kg-1 x hr-1 i.v. continuous infusion). Animals in group 1 (n = 10) received no angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor while animals in group 2 (n = 10) were given 10 mg x kg-1 i.v. captopril 30 minutes prior to the ischemic period. Ischemia was produced by unilateral carotid artery ligation and hemorrhagic hypotension to 35 mm Hg for 30 minutes. Body temperature, arterial blood gases, and arterial pH were maintained constant. Neurologic outcome was evaluated every 24 hours for 3 days using a graded deficit score (0, normal; 18, stroke-related death). On the third day after ischemia, captopril significantly improved neurologic outcome (median deficit score = 4) compared with controls (median deficit score = 18) (p less than 0.05). These results suggest that reduced angiotensin II levels or increased tissue kinin concentrations may decrease ischemic brain injury.",

During that time, urinary albumin levels significantly descended (p < 0.001), with a concomitant rise in serum albumin. We conclude that captopril can be effective as a part of the treatment of albuminuria associated with nephropathy of non diabetic origin.", 
    "391": "Secondary hypertension represents about 5-10% of all forms of hypertension, renal and renovascular being the commonest forms. Renal artery stenosis is the principal cause of renovascular hypertension due to atheromatous disease or fibromuscular dysplasia. Rapid sequence intravenous pyelogram, isotope renogram, captopril test and digital subtraction angiography or conventional arteriography, are the diagnostic procedures in the diagnosis of renal artery atenosis. Hypertension is also very common in parenchymal renal disease, mainly in chronic renal insufficiency. In this condition, the mechanism is more related to volume dependent factors than in renovascular hypertension which is mainly renin dependent. In the treatment of renal or renovascular hypertension the same type of drugs have been generally used as in essential hypertension although with some specific indications like the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in unilateral renal artery stenosis or furosemide in case of renal insufficiency. Revascularization by angioplasty or surgical bypass, may be indicated in renovascular hypertension.", 
    "392": "The newborn infant is in a state of renal insufficiency with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) as low as 20 ml/min per 1.73 m2 at term, and 10 ml/min per 1.73 m2 at 28 weeks of gestation. While the immature \"insufficient\" kidney can cope with most of the normal demands, its reserve is limited, and often overwhelmed by commonly occurring neonatal stresses. Various vasoactive systems such as the renin-angiotensin system, intrarenal adenosine, the prostaglandins and the atrial natriuretic peptide, are hyperactive in the neonatal period. Some of these systems appear crucial for the maintenance of GFR. Overstimulation of both angiotensin II and adenosine by an hypoxaemic stress can further impair the GFR, eventually leading to established renal failure. Inhibition of angiotensin II formation by the administration of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors can, on the other hand, also lead to renal failure. Prevention of these renal risks requires a precise knowledge of the newborn kidney physiology, physiopathology and pharmacology.", 
    "393": "The goal of the present study was to characterize the new renin inhibitor Ro 42-5892 in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, Ro 42-5892 inhibited purified human renin and human plasma renin specifically with an IC50 of 0.7 nM and 0.8 nM, respectively. In vivo, Ro 42-5892 reduced mean arterial blood pressure in sodium-depleted marmosets and squirrel monkeys with as low a dose as 0.1 mg/kg orally. Higher doses reduced pressure by 30-35 mm Hg in both species. The duration of blood pressure decrease with 3 mg/kg orally was more than 24 hours. Maximal changes of plasma renin activity, immunoreactive angiotensin I, and immunoreactive angiotensin II were observed at 15 minutes. Renin was reduced by 74 +/- 31%, angiotensin I by 85 +/- 14%, angiotensin II by 89 +/- 17%, and immunoreactive active renin was increased by 70 +/- 39%. However, unlike pressure, these maximal effects were only transient with complete recovery of renin at 60 minutes under still reduced levels of angiotensin I (61 +/- 24%) and angiotensin II (71 +/- 38%) and increased concentrations of active renin (86 +/- 30%). The blood pressure lowering was due to specific renin inhibition as exemplified by the influence of the kidney, sodium status, species, or stereoselectivity. Moreover, the reduction of arterial blood pressure was similar to the action of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor cilazapril and was not associated with reflex tachycardia in contrast to the pure vasodilator minoxidil. We conclude that Ro 42-5892 is a potent orally active renin inhibitor acting mainly by inhibition of renin in an extraplasmatic compartment.", 
    "394": "Major advances in left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and hypertension have occurred in recent years. The ability to diagnose LVH has been improved by echocardiography, and with this technique it has been shown that evidence of LVH is an important independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The major cause of death in patients with hypertension and LVH is coronary artery disease. Therefore an understanding of the interrelationships between these two disorders is fundamental, and it is now clear that the hypertrophied ventricle is vulnerable to myocardial ischemia. Appreciation of the mechanisms of sudden death has also increased, although the exact situation in patients with LVH remains to be clarified. Regression of LVH is known to occur with the use of several different antihypertensive drugs. Recent studies indicate that the calcium blocking agent nicardipine, in addition to beta-blocking drugs and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, brings about LVH regression without any deterioration of left ventricular function. However, further studies are needed to assess the long-term benefits of this regression.",

Administration of 40 mg Iso-Mack ret. every 8 hours for four weeks did not lead to the development of tolerance. However, captopril added to isosorbide dinitrate tends to improve the investigated indicators after a single dose as well as after long-term treatment. It is probable that concurrent administration of the two drugs causes addition of their vasodilatating action and thus the vascular resistance declines, as well as the cardiac pre-load and after-load and the oxygen consumption of the heart muscle. The authors discuss possible mechanisms of the increased vasodilatation after addition of captopril.", 
    "396": "Perindopril is a long acting angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, which displays similar pharmacodynamic properties to other agents in this class. In common with enalapril, it is also a prodrug. After absorption, perindopril is hydrolysed to the active metabolite, perindoprilat, and with once daily administration adequate 24-hour inhibition of ACE is obtained. Perindopril 4 to 8mg once daily is usually effective for blood pressure control in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. Those patients who do not respond adequately to monotherapy with perindopril usually respond with the addition of a second agent, such as a thiazide diuretic. General practice trials indicate that perindopril is at least as effective and as well tolerated as usual therapeutic dosages of captopril, atenolol or hydrochlorothiazide plus amiloride in mild to moderate essential hypertension. Preliminary results indicate that perindopril may also be effective in patients with severe hypertension or congestive heart failure. Perindopril is generally well tolerated and has an adverse effect profile similar to that of other ACE inhibitors. It further clinical experience confirms initial findings, perindopril is likely to represent a useful alternative to other members of the ACE inhibitor class in all grades of hypertension and congestive heart failure.", 
    "397": "The effect of enalapril on renal hemodynamics and glomerular permselectivity was studied in eight patients with nephrotic syndrome secondary to biopsy-proven membranous glomerulonephritis. The patients received the drug in incremental doses (median, 5 mg) until 24-hour urinary protein excretion had decreased persistently by 30%. Median treatment duration was 6 weeks. Patients were studied three times: (I) after a 4-week run-in period, (II) on the final day of treatment, and (III) after a 4-week wash-out. Median 24-hour urinary protein excretion decreased on treatment from 10.45 g/d to 5.25 g/d and increased to pretreatment levels after the drug was stopped (P less than 0.05 for both changes). Fractional clearance of dextrans greater than 4.1 nm decreased on treatment, indicating both a reduction of macromolecules passing through the shunt pathway of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) and a possible decrease in ultrafiltration coefficient. There were no significant changes in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), effective renal plasma flow (ERPF), or mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) throughout the study. The effect of enalapril in treating proteinuria appears therefore to be due to a specific intraglomerular action.", 
    "398": "Glucocorticoids inhibit plasma extravasation induced in the rat tracheal mucosa by substance P and other tachykinins released from sensory nerves. This study was performed to determine whether this antiinflammatory effect of glucocorticoids is mediated by the tachykinin-degrading enzymes neutral endopeptidase (NEP) and kininase II (angiotensin converting enzyme, ACE). In addition, we studied the effect of dexamethasone on a nonpeptide inflammatory mediator, platelet-activating factor (PAF), which is not degraded by NEP or ACE. Adult male pathogen-free F344 rats were treated for 2 d with dexamethasone (0.5 mg/kg per d i.p.), or with the vehicle used to dissolve the steroid. The magnitude of plasma extravasation produced by an intravenous injection of substance P (5 micrograms/kg) or PAF (10 micrograms/kg) was then assessed by using Monastral blue pigment as an intravascular tracer. The role of NEP and ACE activities in the changes produced by dexamethasone was investigated by examining the effect of the selective inhibitors of these enzymes, phosphoramidon and captopril. Dexamethasone reduced the substance P-induced extravasation by 57% but did not affect the PAF-induced extravasation. The suppressive effect of dexamethasone on substance P-induced extravasation was completely reversed by simultaneously inhibiting NEP and ACE activities, but the inhibition of these enzymes had no effect on PAF-induced extravasation, regardless of whether the rats were pretreated with dexamethasone or not. These results suggest that NEP and ACE mediate a selective inhibitory effect of glucocorticoids on neurogenic plasma extravasation.", 
    "399": "There is growing recognition that angiotensin II (ANG II) formed intrarenally exerts direct effects on renal hemodynamics and tubular reabsorption. In vivo micropuncture experiments performed in anesthetized rats have shown that peritubular capillary infusion of either ANG II or angiotensin I (ANG I), at rates that do not markedly influence baseline vascular resistance, can increase proximal tubular reabsorption rate and enhance the responsiveness of the tubuloglomerular feedback mechanism. With higher ANG II or ANG I infusion rates, pronounced preglomerular vasoconstriction occurs, resulting in reduced glomerular capillary pressure and single nephron glomerular filtration rate. The effects of peritubular capillary infusion of ANG I on glomerular function have been shown to be inhibited by the ANG II receptor antagonist, saralasin, indicating that the observed effects of ANG I on proximal tubular reabsorption and glomerular function are not due to direct effects of the decapeptide but are mediated by increases in the interstitial ANG II concentrations resulting from intrarenally generated ANG II. Interestingly, neither peritubular capillary infusion nor systemic administration of large doses of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, enalaprilat, elicited significant blockade of the single nephron hemodynamic responses to peritubular infusion of ANG I. These findings indicate that intrarenal conversion of ANG I to ANG II occurs, at least in part, at a site which is inaccessible to acutely administered ACE inhibitors, or that there is an alternative pathway for the intrarenal conversion of ANG I to ANG II that is not blocked by ACE inhibitors.", 
    "400": "Reduction of morbidity and mortality has been the aim of drug treatment for hypertension since its beginning in the 1950s. Its efficacy has been tested in many trials. An outstanding result of these trials has been their clear success in preventing stroke and stroke-related deaths and in decreasing the incidence of congestive heart failure (CHF) and renal disease. A similar success has not been achieved in reducing coronary heart disease endpoints. Diuretics and beta-blockers played a central role in these studies; however, their adverse effects on lipid metabolism have been cited as a possible explanation for the failure of antihypertensive therapy to affect coronary heart disease (CHD). Recently, the extent and significance of these lipid changes has been put into perspective, and new insights into the role of carbohydrate metabolism and insulin resistance in hypertension have emerged. The same drugs which adversely affect lipid metabolism also adversely affect carbohydrate metabolism, and more is becoming known about these mechanisms and their role in hypertension and its sequelae. Other classes of antihypertensive drugs such as the calcium antagonists, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and alpha 1-antagonists do not share these adverse effects. It has become increasingly clear that effective antihypertensive therapy includes both the lowering of blood pressure and containment of the abnormalities that accompany the hypertensive state.", 
    "401": "The acute efficacy of rapid loading of oral long-acting enalapril in congestive heart failure remains to be established. We evaluated the efficacy of this treatment modality in 22 patients with chronic congestive heart failure N.Y.H.A. functional class ranging from II-IV with Creatinine level less than 2 mg/dl. Following hemodynamic evaluation, there was significant favorable change in the left ventricular functional curve. Moreover, acute hemodynamic assessment showed a significant reduction in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure from 19.2 +/- 4.8 to 17.2 +/- 4.7 mmHg (p less than 0.005) and an increases in stroke volume index from 28.3 +/- 9.2 to 33.1 +/- 7.5 ml/m (p less than 0.005). After rapid enalaprilization, blood pressure fell from 127 +/- 21/78 +/- 15 to 108 +/- 21/68 +/- 15 mmHg (p less than 0.005), systemic vascular resistance from 1725 +/- 602 to 1370 +/- 376 dyne.sec.cm-5 (p less than 0.05) and pulmonary vascular resistance from 262 +/- 19 to 218 +/- 65 dyne.sec.cm-5 (p less than 0.05). Cardiac index rose significantly from 2.43 +/- 0.62 to 2.60 +/- 0.50 l/min/m2 (p less than 0.05). In terms of neurohumoral assessments, there was a significant inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Aldosterone fell from 21.3 +/- 13.4 to 9.4 +/- 8.0 ng/dl and plasma renin activity rose from 3.3 +/- 4.6 to 11.3 +/- 11.0 ng/nl/hr (p less than 0.005). Plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine levels were found to have significant reduction in addition to antidiuretic hormone concentration. During short-term trial, left ventricular ejection fraction was significantly elevated from 27.5 +/- 6% to 32.8 +/- 10.8% (p less than 0.005). Thus, this limited study clearly demonstrates the rapid administration of enalapril not only achieves inhibition of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system but also reduces preload and afterload significantly in the failing heart. We conclude that rapid enalaprilization is an effective methodology which still needs meticulous attention, providing significant hemodynamic and symptomatic benefits in patients with chronic congestive heart failure.", 
    "402": "The double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational trial Xamoterol in Severe Heart Failure randomized 290 patients treated with captopril and 217 treated with enalapril to xamoterol or placebo. At the end of the 100-day follow-up period, the cumulative probability of survival in patients with coronary artery disease or with dilated cardiomyopathy decreased in the captopril group (90.3%) when compared with the enalapril group (97.2%). The excess mortality in the captopril group could not be related to the indexes of the severity of heart failure, such as baseline exercise duration, functional class, cardiothoracic ratio, ejection fraction or dose of diuretic drugs. Furthermore, the excess in mortality was seen in all subsets of patients examined as well as across countries. Examination of the dosing regimen used, however, suggests that insufficient daily dosage of captopril or the inadequate schedule of administration, or both, might be responsible for different degrees of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition between the enalapril and captopril groups and hence for the difference in mortality. It is important in future clinical trials to determine to what extent complete circadian angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition is necessary to provide the full benefit of this therapy in heart failure.",

The drug administered in doses of 3-30 mg/kg ip neither affected the reserpine- or apomorphine-induced hypothermia in mice nor reduced the immobility time in the forces swimming test in mice and rats. Moreover, captopril administered repeatedly (10 mg/kg ip, twice daily for 14 days) neither changed the density or affinity of cortical beta-adrenoceptors nor modified the nomifensine-induced locomotor hyperactivity in rats. These results suggest that captopril has no antidepressant-like activity in animal models.", 
    "409": "The effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) were examined under resting conditions and after stimulation with bradykinin in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells. The ACE inhibitors ramiprilat and enalaprilat (0.3 microM) enhanced the increase in [Ca2+]i elicited by bradykinin (3 nM) and also caused an increase in resting [Ca2+]i when given alone. This increase in resting [Ca2+]i was long-lasting and accompanied by an increased formation of nitric oxide, as assessed by a NG-nitro-L-arginine-sensitive cyclic GMP accumulation in the cells. Both increases in resting [Ca2+]i and nitric oxide production by ACE inhibitors were inhibited by preincubation of the cells with the B2-receptor antagonist Hoe 140. These data indicate that ACE inhibitors are able to unmask a release of bradykinin from cultured human endothelial cells. This endothelium-derived bradykinin can exert an autocrine function by stimulating endothelial B2-receptors with a subsequent increase in [Ca2+]i and nitric oxide formation.", 
    "410": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are of benefit in life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias in patients with congestive heart failure and ventricular tachycardia caused by the onset of myocardial ischemia as well as by reperfusion of an ischemic area. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether direct electrophysiological effects are responsible for these observations. Therefore, we investigated the electrophysiological effects of lisinopril on the whole cardiac conduction and pacemaker system in isolated guinea pig hearts perfused by the method of Langendorff at concentrations of 0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10 microM. Lisinopril did not affect heart rate, atrioventricular, His bundle, or intraventricular conduction at any of the concentrations tested. Likewise the frequency-dependent QT duration was unchanged. At a concentration of 10 microM, lisinopril prolonged effective refractory period evaluated by premature beats (46 +/- 15%, n = 8, p less than 0.01) as well as the rate-dependent effective refractory period (31 +/- 12, n = 8, p less than 0.01) of the atrioventricular conduction. These effects can be explained by lisinopril's action as a minor calcium antagonist at a toxic concentration of 10 microM. The present results show that electrophysiological parameters are not substantially altered by lisinopril. Therefore, several other mechanisms such as the unloading of the left ventricle and/or the suppression of noradrenalin release and the electrolyte (potassium and magnesium) repletion and/or regression of left ventricular hypertrophy as long-term effects may play a major role in the antiarrhythmic efficacy of ACE inhibitors.", 
    "411": "Prolongation of bradykinin half-life following kininase inhibition has been proposed as the reason for the potentiation of kinin effects. We have reassessed this assumption by using three different isolated smooth muscle preparations and simultaneously studying the inhibition of kininase activity and the potentiation of bradykinin effects by enalaprilat and BPP9a. Rat duodenum displayed higher total kininase activity, metabolizing half of the added bradykinin in 6.5 min, while this time for rat uterus was greater than 60 min. Guinea-pig ileum showed the intermediate value of 14.6 min. Enalaprilat and BPP9a slowed the metabolism of bradykinin by 50-100% in rat duodenum and by 50-180% in guinea-pig ileum, showing that a significant fraction of total kininase activity appears to be due to kininase II. In rat duodenum, an almost complete blockade of kininase activity was achieved when bacitracin and mergetpa were used together with enalaprilat. Enalaprilat and BPP9a potentiated bradykinin effects in guinea-pig ileum and rat uterus. In contrast, bradykinin-induced relaxations and contractions in rat duodenum were not potentiated by enalaprilat, BPP9a, or by the enzyme inhibitor mixture (enalaprilat--bacitracin--mergetpa). The results suggest that inhibition of bradykinin enzymatic metabolism by kininases does not necessarily lead to the potentiation of bradykinin effects.", 
    "412": "To examine the role of the tissue renin-angiotensin system in left ventricular hypertrophy, converting enzyme inhibitors were administered orally to 12-week-old male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) for 4 weeks, and cardiac tissue angiotensin II was measured. Treatment with enalapril (10 mg/kg per day) and trandolapril (1 mg/kg per day) lowered systolic blood pressure, left ventricular weight and left ventricular angiotensin II content. Plasma angiotensin II concentration was increased by the treatment with enalapril whereas trandolapril did not cause any change. There was significantly positive correlation between left ventricular weight and angiotensin II content. Because angiotensin II promotes cell proliferation, these results suggest that cardiac tissue angiotensin II, rather than circulating angiotensin II, may account for the pathophysiology of left ventricular hypertrophy in SHR.", 
    "413": "Milan hypertensive rats were treated, from ages 4 to 24 weeks, with the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, perindopril, in doses of 1.5 mg/kg per day or 0.4 mg/kg per day. Controls were untreated Milan hypertensive rats. At age 24 weeks, a mesenteric biopsy was taken, from which two resistance vessels were taken out and mounted on a myograph for structural and functional analysis. Thereafter, treatment was withdrawn and the blood pressure of the rats was followed until age 36 weeks. Perindopril treatment had a dose-dependent effect on blood pressure as well as on both structural (media thickness, media: lumen ratio) and functional (estimated pressure against which vessels could contract) parameters of the resistance vessels. However, when treatment was withdrawn, blood pressure rose to (low-dose perindopril group) or above (high-dose perindopril group) control levels. The results contrast with previous studies using spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHR) where, using the same protocol, blood pressure remains low after withdrawal of treatment with ACE inhibitors, including perindopril, although the effect on resistance vessel parameters is similar. The results show that the persistent effect of ACE inhibitor therapy which has been seen in SHR is not a general feature of genetic hypertension. Furthermore, these results raise doubts as to whether the persistent effect seen in SHR is due to a general effect of ACE inhibitor treatment on vascular structure.", 
    "414": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors lead to induction of ACE in animals and humans. This complicates the use of ACE enzymatic activity as an index of inhibition in plasma or tissues after chronic administration of ACE inhibitors. We have, therefore, developed a method for ACE measurement by in vitro autoradiography using an 125I-labelled inhibitor to quantitate total ACE and the concentration of free (not inhibited) ACE in tissues after prolonged administration of ACE inhibitors to rats. Measurements made on unprocessed tissue sections reflect residual free ACE activity in the presence of the unlabelled inhibitor. In a parallel series of adjacent sections, the ACE inhibitor is dissociated from the enzyme by reversibly denaturing the enzyme by zinc chelation. This is followed by reconstitution of the active enzyme by zinc ion replacement and measuring total enzyme concentration. This technique permits measurement of the extent of ACE inhibition and induction. This method was evaluated in tissues of rats following chronic oral administration of lisinopril (10 mg/kg per day) for 2 weeks. The pattern of ACE inhibition was similar to that seen in our previous acute studies. However, induction of ACE was found to be organ specific; plasma total ACE increased 1.75-fold and total ACE in the lung increased by 30% compared with untreated animals, but there was no demonstrable change in total ACE concentration in the kidney, adrenal or aorta. Despite this, during chronic treatment with lisinopril, ACE activity in all of these organs was inhibited with low levels of free ACE.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "415": "The potent vasoconstrictor endothelin 1 (ET-1) is thought to arise from the proteolytic processing of big endothelin 1 (Big ET) by a unique endothelin-converting enzyme, possibly a metalloprotease. Experiments were conducted to determine the effects of Big ET on cardiovascular and renal functions during inhibition of metalloprotease activity in vivo. Intravenous infusion of Big ET (0.1 nmol.kg-1.min-1) in anesthetized euvolemic rats produced a significant increase in mean arterial pressure (MAP; 39 +/- 8%) and a decrease in effective renal plasma flow (ERPF; -39 +/- 2%), whereas glomerular filtration rate (GFR) remained unchanged (-8 +/- 8%). Simultaneous intravenous infusion of phosphoramidon (0.25 mg.kg-1.min-1), an inhibitor of metalloprotease activity including neutral endopeptidase EC 3.4.24.11 (NEP), completely prevented these effects of Big ET. Thiorphan (0.1 mg.kg-1.min-1), also an inhibitor of NEP, had absolutely no effect on either the renal or cardiovascular response to Big ET. Similarly, the response to Big ET was unaffected by infusion of enalaprilat (0.1 mg.kg-1.min-1), an inhibitor of the angiotensin-converting enzyme, which is also a metalloprotease. To determine whether the effect of phosphoramidon was due to antagonism of ET-1, an identical series of experiments was performed using ET-1 infusion (0.02 nmol.kg-1.min-1). Although the increase in MAP (24 +/- 5%) produced by ET-1 was less than that observed for the given dose of Big ET, the renal vasoconstriction was much more severe; the smaller peptide changed ERPF and GFR by -66 +/- 7 and -54 +/- 9%, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "416": "Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in rats with genetic hypertension is accompanied by abnormal myocardial diastolic stiffness and impaired coronary reserve. Whether these functional defects are related to a structural remodeling of the myocardium that includes an interstitial and perivascular fibrosis, myocyte hypertrophy, and medial thickening of intramyocardial coronary arteries is uncertain. To address these issues, 14-week-old male spontaneously hypertensive rats with established hypertension and LVH were treated with low-dose (SLO group: 2.5 mg/kg/day, n = 11) or high-dose (SHI group: 20 mg/kg/day, n = 9) oral lisinopril for 12 weeks to sustain hypertension and LVH or to normalize arterial pressure and myocardial mass, respectively. When SHI and SLO groups were compared with age- and sex-matched 26-week-old untreated spontaneously hypertensive rats (n = 11) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (n = 9), we found 1) normalization of blood pressure (p less than 0.005) and complete regression of LVH (p less than 0.005) in the SHI group and no significant blood pressure or LVH reduction in the SLO group, 2) complete regression of morphometrically determined myocardial interstitial and perivascular fibrosis in SHI and SLO groups (p less than 0.025) associated with normalization of diastolic stiffness, measured in the isolated heart (p less than 0.025), and 3) regression of medial wall thickening of intramyocardial coronary arteries only in the SHI group (P less than 0.005), accompanied by a normalization of coronary vasodilator reserve to adenosine (p less than 0.005). Thus, interstitial fibrosis and not LVH is responsible for abnormal myocardial diastolic stiffness, whereas medical wall thickening of intramyocardial resistance vessels, influenced by arterial pressure, is associated with impaired coronary reserve.", 
    "417": "The molecular forms of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE; EC 3.4.15.1) in preparations of pig brain cortical microvessels and striatal synaptosomal membranes have been identified by immunoelectrophoretic blot analysis. The cortical microvessels contained only the endothelial form of the enzyme, Mr 180,000, which comigrated with pig kidney ACE on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In contrast, the synaptosomal membranes contained only a smaller form of ACE, Mr 170,000, which represents the neuronal form of the enzyme. No significant differences in inhibitor sensitivity or substrate specificity were detected between the two forms of ACE. In particular, neurokinin A was resistant to hydrolysis by either microvessel or synaptosomal membrane ACE, and the pattern of hydrolysis of substance P by the two preparations was identical.", 
    "418": "Enzymatic properties of dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase (DCP) from Bacillus pumilus were investigated. The enzyme was more active on tri- and tetrapeptides than angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) from rabbit lung. The presence of chloride ion is essential for the hydrolysis. The Km value of angiotensin I for the enzyme was 0.119 x 10(-3) M. The enzyme was not inhibited by the mammalian ACE inhibitors lisinopril and enalaprilat. The enzyme is readily inhibited by EDTA but restored by Co2+, Mn2+, and Zn2+. Therefore, it seems to be a zinc-metallo protease.", 
    "419": "Recent epidemiological studies clearly indicate that blood pressure rises with age and that hypertension remains a major risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in the elderly. An accurate antihypertensive therapy reduces in these patients the incidence of stroke and heart failure. Because of their clinical efficiency and good therapeutic tolerance, the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are first-line drugs for the treatment of elderly hypertensive patients. ACE inhibitions is expected to normalize blood pressure in approximately 40-60% of the patients. When needed, they can be combined with other drugs of different antihypertensive properties. In these cases, the most rational combination therapy consists of an ACE inhibitor with a diuretic or a calcium antagonist.", 
    "420": "Therapeutic agents for the treatment of hypertension in the elderly are the well known basic antihypertensive drugs (Diuretics, beta-blocking agents, calcium antagonists and ACE-inhibitors). Choice is determined by concomittant diseases increasing with age. In the elderly patient the assessment of benefit and risk is particularly essential. Drugs should therefore not be installed without exact information of the patient and be started at the smallest possible dose. If tolerance is good the dose may be raised of prescription of an additional drug be evaluated cautiously.", 
    "421": "The primary purpose of this research was to determine the effect of ozone inhalation on pulmonary vascular endothelium. Male Fischer-344 rats were exposed to 0.5 or 0.7 ppm ozone, 20 hr/day for 7 days. Lungs were excised and perfused with Krebs medium containing [14C]serotonin or [14C]hippurylhistidylleucine (HHL). When compared to controls, the animals exposed to the lower ozone concentration showed no statistically significant changes in serotonin removal. In contrast, the higher ozone concentration resulted in a 32% decrease (p less than 0.0001) in serotonin removal, but had no effect on HHL. Rats similarly exposed to 0.7 ppm ozone but allowed to recover for 14 days in clean air showed no decrease in serotonin removal compared to their controls. Animals exposed sequentially to 0.5 ppm ozone for 7 days and then to 0.7 ppm for 7 days showed no alteration in serotonin metabolism, suggesting the development of tolerance initiated by the lower dose. After 7 days exposure to 0.7 ppm ozone, lung ventilatory function measurements revealed small though significant decreases in several parameters. Electron microscopic evaluation of lung capillary endothelium from animals exposed to the 0.7 ppm ozone showed no changes. Positive control animals exposed to greater than 95% oxygen, 20 hr/day for 2 days showed a 23% decrease in serotonin removal (p less than 0.03) and a 12% decrease in HHL removal (p less than 0.017). These studies indicate that inhalation of ozone can induce functional alterations in the lung endothelium, and that this effect occurs at a dosage of ozone that produces minimal ventilatory changes and no observable endothelial ultrastructural changes.", 
    "422": "Angiotensin has an intrarenal action which may not parallel its action in the general circulation. We investigated whether the urinary excretion rates of angiotensin I and II (UV-AI, UV-AII) can be used as a marker of renal production. We therefore measured UV-AI, UV-AII, plasma angiotensin I and II (PAI, PAII), and plasma renin activity (PRA) in healthy subjects under conditions influencing the renin-angiotensin system: captopril injection (n = 7), enalapril treatment (n = 9), furosemide infusion on high and low sodium intake (n = 6), indomethacin treatment (n = 8), and head-out water immersion (three sodium intakes). After captopril (acute) and enalapril (chronic), PAI and PRA increased, PAII decreased, but neither UV-AI nor UV-AII changed. During furosemide infusion, PAI, PAII, PRA, as well as UV-AI and UV-AII increased. During indomethacin treatment, PAI, PAII, and PRA decreased, whereas UV-AI and UV-AII did not change consistently. Sodium restriction increased PAI, PAII, and PRA, but did not alter UV-AI and UV-AII. Head-out immersion decreased PAI, PAII, and PRA, but did not change UV-AI and UV-AII. The relative constancy of the urinary AI and AII excretion rates makes it doubtful whether urinary angiotensins reflect changes of renal angiotensin production.", 
    "423": "The value of renography before and after angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition with captopril (captopril renography) as a test for renovascular hypertension was studied in fourteen hypertensive patients. The captopril renography was performed with 99mTc-DTPA by means of a gammacamera, allowing determination of single kidney glomerular filtration rate (SKGFR). In all patients determination of renal vein plasma renin concentration and renal angiography were carried out. Eleven patients showed an elevated unilateral renin secretion. All of these had a significant decrease of SKGFR in one or both kidneys after captopril. Three patients without a lateralized renal renin secretion showed no change in SKGFR. In five patients with presumed essential hypertension there was no change in SKGFR during captopril renography. Captopril renography with 99mTc-DTPA gammacamera renography is a promising tool for identification of unilateral increased renin secretion in hypertensive patients suspected of renovascular hypertension.", 
    "424": "This study examined whether angiotensin II (ANG II) influences the pressure-natriuretic (PN) response by altering renal cortical or medullary hemodynamics. Studies were performed in Inactin-anesthetized rats that were acutely volume expanded to maintain plasma renin activity and ANG II levels in the physiological range. Neural influences on the kidney were eliminated by renal denervation, and plasma levels of norepinephrine, vasopressin, cortisol, and aldosterone were fixed by intravenous infusion. In control rats (n = 8), sodium excretion increased from 3 to 17 microeq.min-1.g kidney wt-1 as renal perfusion pressure (RPP) was elevated from 96 to 141 mmHg (n = 8). Captopril (2 mg/kg, n = 9) reduced plasma levels of ANG II from 48 +/- 5 to 18 +/- 2 pg/ml, but it did not alter the PN relationship. Infusion of ANG II (20 ng.kg-1.min-1, n = 9) increased plasma levels of ANG II to 232 +/- 42 pg/ml and shifted the PN relationship to the right by 14 mmHg. Captopril increased renal blood flow, and infusion of ANG II returned it to control. Captopril had no effect on glomerular filtration rate (GFR) or glomerular capillary pressure (Pglom); however, subsequent ANG II infusion decreased Pglom from 56 +/- 2 to 48 +/- 2 mmHg and reduced GFR by 30%. Neither captopril nor ANG II altered papillary bloodflow or vasa recta capillary pressure at normal levels of RPP. These results indicate that the shift of the PN relationship during infusion of ANG II is due to a decrease in filtered load and enhanced tubular reabsorption of sodium. Acute blockade of the renin-angiotensin system had little effect on the PN response in volume-expanded rats despite affecting renal hemodynamics, because either the plasma and/or intrarenal levels of ANG II were already suppressed below those needed to influence tubular function or volume expansion inhibits tubular reabsorption in the nephron segments normally influenced by ANG II.", 
    "425": "The involvement of angiotensin II (ANG II) in the genetic polydipsia of the STR/N strain of mice was investigated. Daily water intake of the polydipsic inbred STR/N of both sexes ranged between five and eight times that of nonpolydipsic controls: STR/1N, a mutant of the STR/N, and Swiss-Webster (S/W) mice. Nevertheless the diurnal pattern of drinking was maintained in the STR/N. There was no difference in daily food intake, arterial blood pressure, and plasma renin activity among the three groups. Drinking responses to 48 h of water deprivation were not significantly different between the polydipsic mice and their control groups. Captopril, an angiotensin I converting-enzyme inhibitor, injected subcutaneously just before the dark period, reduced drinking for 6 h in the polydipsic strain only. Food intake of all three groups of mice was not affected. Similarly the ANG II antagonist saralasin, [Sar1,-Ile8]ANG II, injected into the lateral cerebroventricle just before the dark period, significantly reduced water intake for 6 h after injection in the polydipsic mice only. Intracerebroventricular injection of ANG II increased drinking in the nondeprived controls but not in the polydipsic mice. These findings suggest that the polydipsia in the STR/N mice may involve, at least in part, the ANG II system in the brain.", 
    "426": "Normotensive rats were chronically given 100 mg.kg-1.day-1 of captopril in their drinking water beginning 1 day before uninephrectomy. Mean blood pressure was significantly decreased 4 (17%) and 8 (18%) wk later in treated rats vs. age-matched controls. When histological techniques were used, a marked reduction of medial-intimal area of the abdominal aorta was found in treated rats at 4 (24%) and 8 (15%) wk without significant change in internal diameter. Cremaster arteriolar dimensions were measured by intravital microscopy after topical application of 10(-3) M adenosine. Structural diameter reductions occurred in large arterioles starting at 4 wk in treated rats and in small arterioles at 8 wk. Despite a significant increase in wall-to-lumen ratio of some large and small arterioles in treated rats, the wall cross-sectional area of these vessels was significantly decreased by captopril. Measured by stereological techniques, small arteriolar density decreased 17% at 4 wk and 13% at 8 wk in treated rats. Although decreased blood pressure may contribute to smaller aortic cross-sectional wall area, the effect of captopril was probably the major cause for smaller arteriolar lumens, reduced arteriolar cross-sectional wall areas, and arteriolar rarefaction.", 
    "427": "The objective of this study was to examine effects of nonpeptide angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor antagonists on renal vasoconstrictor responses to renal nerve stimulation (RNS) and intrarenal injection of norepinephrine in pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs. The subtype 1-selective Ang II receptor antagonists, DuP 753 (2-n-butyl-4-chloro-5-(hydroxymethyl)-1-[(2'-(1H- tetrazol-5-yl)biphenyl-4-yl)methyl]imidazole, potassium salt) and EXP3174 (2-n-butyl-4-chloro-1-[(2'-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl) biphenyl-4-yl)methyl]imidazole-5-carboxylic acid) given intra-arterially to the kidney caused dose-dependent reductions of renal vasoconstrictor responses to RNS but not to norepinephrine. In contrast, the subtype 2-selective Ang II receptor specific ligand, PD 123177 (1-[(4-amino-3-methylphenyl)methyl]-5-(diphenylacetyl)-4,5,6,7- tetrahydro-1H-imidazo[4,5-c]pyridine-6-carboxylic acid), did not alter the renal vasoconstrictor responses to RNS, norepinephrine, and Ang II in doses of 10-100 micrograms/kg/min i.a. Captopril also reduced the renal vasoconstrictor responses to RNS but not to norepinephrine. However, saralasin did not alter the renal vasoconstrictor responses to RNS and norepinephrine, although it was as effective as DuP 753 and EXP3174 in blocking the renal vasoconstrictor response to Ang II. These results suggest that endogenous Ang II enhances renal adrenergic function at the prejunctional site in anesthetized dogs. Analogous to the Ang II receptor in vascular smooth muscle, the prejunctional Ang II receptor appears to be of subtype 1. Mechanisms accounting for the absence of the inhibition of Ang II-mediated renal adrenergic response by saralasin remain to be determined.", 
    "428": "When the function of the renin system is inhibited, blood pressure becomes more dependent on changes in sodium and water balance. Diuretics alone and sodium restriction alone are additive to converting enzyme inhibitor therapy. However, it is not known if these two ways of reducing sodium balance are additive in the presence of established converting enzyme inhibition. We therefore performed a double-blind crossover study of the effects of moderate sodium restriction in 21 patients with essential hypertension who were already being treated with the combination of a converting enzyme inhibitor and a diuretic. After 1 month of captopril (50 mg twice daily) and hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg once daily) therapy, with their usual sodium intake, average supine blood pressure was 147/96 +/- 5/3 (SEM) mm Hg 2 hours after treatment. Patients then reduced their sodium intake to around 80-100 mmol/day for the remainder of the study. After 2 weeks of sodium restriction, they entered a double-blind, randomized, crossover study of Slow Sodium (100 mmol sodium/day) compared with Slow Sodium placebo, while continuing sodium restriction and the above treatment. During the double-blind study, after 1 month of treatment with captopril (50 mg twice daily), hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg once daily), and Slow Sodium placebo, supine blood pressure 2 hours after treatment was 138/88 +/- 4/2 mm Hg (24-hour urinary sodium 104 +/- 11 mmol). After 1 month of captopril (50 mg twice daily), hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg once daily), and Slow Sodium tablets, supine blood pressure 2 hours after treatment was 147/91 +/- 5/2 mm Hg (p less than 0.05; 24-hour urinary sodium 195 +/- 14 mmol).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "429": "To assess the possibility that the renin-angiotensin system may play a role in the development of cold-induced hypertension, three groups of rats were used. Two groups were exposed to cold (5 +/- 2 degrees C) while the remaining group was kept at 26 +/- 2 degrees C. One group of cold-treated rats received food into which captopril (0.06% by weight) had been thoroughly mixed. The remaining two groups received the same food but without captopril. Systolic blood pressure of the untreated, cold-exposed group increased significantly above that of the warm-adapted, control group within 4 weeks of exposure to cold. In contrast, chronic treatment with captopril prevented the elevation of blood pressure. Rats were killed after 4 months of exposure to cold. At death, the heart, kidneys, adrenal glands, and interscapular brown fat pad were removed and weighed. Although captopril prevented the elevation of blood pressure in cold-treated rats, it did not prevent hypertrophy of the kidneys, heart, and interstitial brown adipose tissue that characteristically accompanies exposure to cold. Thus, chronic treatment with captopril prevented the elevation of blood pressure when administered at the time exposure to cold was initiated. It also reduced the elevated blood pressure of cold-treated rats when administered after blood pressure became elevated. This suggests that the renin-angiotensin system may play a role in the elevation of blood pressure during exposure to cold.", 
    "430": "Sixty-five patients with uncomplicated hypertensive urgencies were treated in the emergency and cardiology departments with 20 mg nifedipine, 20 mg nicardipine, or 25 mg captopril in a randomized study. The study population consisted of 65 patients ranging in age from forty-one to seventy-one. Blood pressure and heart rate were assessed for six hours after intake of the antihypertensive agents. Within sixty minutes nifedipine reduced blood pressure by an average of 74.7 mmHg for the systolic and 35.4 mmHg for the diastolic. Average heart rate increased significantly by 11.6 beats/min at within thirty minutes. Nicardipine and captopril produced equivalent falls in systolic (-81.6 and -79.4 mmHg) and diastolic (-37.3 and -33 mmHg) blood pressure respectively, but did not increase heart rate significantly. The antihypertensive effect of each drug was maintained until six hours after medication. In conclusion, nifedipine, nicardipine, and captopril show similar efficacy in the treatment of hypertensive urgencies. The authors believe that these drugs can be used as first-line therapy in the treatment of hypertensive urgencies safely and effectively.",

Treatment began at 21 days (group 1, n = 100) or more than 6 months after infarction (group 2, n = 60). Patients underwent exercise with real-time gas-exchange analysis nine times over the course of 48 weeks. In group 1, improvement in exercise performance occurred during the course of the trial in both groups of patients receiving placebo or enalapril. The mean peak VO2 for the placebo-treated patients in group 1 increased from 18.3 +/- 3.4 ml/kg/min by 4.9% at 48 weeks (p less than 0.05). The corresponding values for enalapril-treated patients were 18.9 +/- 3.8 ml/kg/min with a 3.7% increase (p = 0.07). Total exercise time increased in the placebo-treated patients from 645 +/- 96 seconds by 7.3% (p less than 0.01).

The corresponding values for enalapril-treated patients were 19.2 +/- 3.6 ml/kg/min with a 2.6% increase (p = NS). Total exercise time increased in the placebo-treated patients from 677 +/- 114 seconds by 0.7% (p = NS). Corresponding values for enalapril-treated patients were 659 +/- 99 seconds with a 1.1% increase (p = NS).

Diuretics and beta adrenergic blockers, effective antihypertensive medications, exhibit some untoward effects on lipid metabolism, while most other antihypertensive medications tend not to exhibit such effects. In animal models, beta adrenergic blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and calcium antagonists have anti-atherogenic effects. A vascular biological approach to therapy for the patient with both hypertension and atherosclerosis is recommended. This includes effective reduction of blood pressure--preferably with agents that do not adversely affect lipid metabolism--and treatment of lipid metabolism disorders.", 
    "435": "Venodilatation may be an important property in drugs used to treat heart failure. Deductions about venous tone from standard hemodynamic studies may be misleading since filling pressures may be reduced by improved left ventricular function. To study the venodilator properties of drugs, we have modified a radionuclide blood pool method and shown that venous volume is increased by 10% after glyceryl trinitrate but is unchanged after the arteriolar dilator hydralazine. In patients with congestive cardiac failure, the calcium channel blocker, felodipine, causes a marked reduction in systemic vascular resistance and left ventricular filling pressures, but venous volume remains unchanged. In a similar group of patients comparable arterial and central effects are seen after the administration of captopril, but venous volume increases by 16%, and this increased venous volume is sustained after 3 months of long-term treatment. Milrinone has been used to treat both acute and chronic heart failure. As expected of a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, it exhibits inotropic properties in animals and humans and also causes arterial vasodilatation. We have studied its effects on venous tone in 10 patients with severe heart failure (New York Heart Association classes III to IV). Milrinone was given intravenously at a loading dose of 50 micrograms/kg followed by an infusion of 0.5 micrograms/kg/min. After treatment, cardiac index, which was measured by thermodilution, increased from 1.8 +/- 0.48 to 2.3 +/- 0.65 L/min/m2 (p less than 0.001); pulmonary artery wedge pressure fell from 23 +/- 6 to 11 +/- 5 mm Hg (p less than 0.001); and systemic vascular resistance index decreased from 4296 to 3168 dynes.sec.cm-5/m2 (p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Sheep (n = 30) were prepared for chronic study with cardiopulmonary catheters, and chronic lung lymph fistulae. They were divided into the following study groups: A) BK infusion; B) LPS; C) LPS with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI); D) ACEI alone; E) LPS with BK antagonist. Cardiac index and mean arterial pressure fell (6.9 +/- 0.4 to 5.3 +/- 0.3 L/min/m2 and 93 +/- 4 to 72 +/- 3 mmHg, respectively), and pulmonary lymph flow increased (10.5 +/- 3.0 to 17.8 +/- 4.3 ml/hr) during BK infusion. Addition of ACEI during BK infusion reduced the amount of BK necessary to induce a comparable response (125 to 2 micrograms/kg/hr). Administration of ACEI to LPS animals did not significantly alter their cardiopulmonary responses. BK antagonist did not change the response to LPS. Although the kallikrein-kinin pathway is believed to be activated during the septic response, our data do not lend support for the hypothesis that bradykinin is an important mediator of the cardiopulmonary changes.",

The antihypertensive effects of benazepril hydrochloride was about 3 times as potent as that of captopril in these models. Single administration (0.3-3 mg/kg p.o.) of benazepril hydrochloride and enalapril maleate showed an equipotent antihypertensive effect in SHR.

Benazepril hydrochloride (3 or 10 mg/kg/d, p.o. for 14 days) dose-dependently inhibited the increase in the blood pressure caused by continuous norepinephrine (NE) infusion in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and suppressed in seizures induced by a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, tranylcypromine in NE infused SHR. Benazepril hydrochloride transiently increased spontaneous motor activity in mice, tended to inhibit acetic acid-induced writhing in mice and decreased fast wave sleep and slow wave deep sleep on EEG in cats at a high dose of 100 mg/kg p.o.

Blood pressure at rest, plasma renin activity, and plasma concentration of atrial natriuretic peptide were measured after treatment periods of two weeks. Bicycle exercise tests at the same time should evaluate ST-segment depression at comparable maximal workload, work capacity, blood pressure, and heart rate at exercise. In comparison to placebo, benazepril reduced arterial blood pressure significantly from 140 +/- 14/90 +/- 11 mm Hg to 125 +/- 16/84 +/- 10 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) and increased plasma renin activity from 2.19 +/- 3.76 ng/ml/h to 9.62 +/- 8.49 ng/ml/h (p less than 0.005). In contrast, ST-segment depression decreased only slightly and not significantly from 2.09 +/- 1.22 mm to 1.91 +/- 1.00 mm. Benazepril had neither an effect on the frequency of episodes of angina pectoris nor did it reduce the amount of GTN-consumption. Also, work capacity and plasma concentration of atrial natriuretic peptide were not changed in comparison to placebo. Although the significant reduction of blood pressure and the highly significant increase of plasma renin activity demonstrate the specific action of benazepril, a significant anti-ischaemic effect could not be established.",

This study enrolled 10 patients with microalbuminuria ranging from 5 mg/day (5 mg/gCr) to 50 mg/day (30 mg/gCr). Histological changes due to diabetic nephropathy were confirmed by renal biopsy performed in 4 of 10 patients. All the patients were divided into 2 groups; 5 patients were given 25 mg of Alacepril for 6 months and the remaining 5 patients were employed as the control. As the results, the mean blood pressure was decreased from 92.7 +/- 9.0 mmHg to 87.3 +/- 11.3 mmHg in Alacepril group but these changes were not statistically significant. Microalbuminuria were significantly decreased from 17.33 +/- 7.82 mg/gCr to 10.43 +/- 4.14 mg/gCr during 6 months in the Alacepril group while in the control group, no significant changes were observed in blood pressure and microalbuminuria.

Both atenolol and enalapril satisfactorily lowered BP during the day and no excessive falls occurred at night. The tendency for BP to increase during the day and decrease at night was maintained during both active periods. Pulse rate was reduced only by atenolol throughout 24 hours. The BP increase observed 2 hours after rising in the morning was suppressed by atenolol but not by enalapril. Both drugs reduced the rates of systolic (greater than or equal to 160 mmHg) and diastolic (greater than or equal to 95 mmHg) BP increases to half of those during placebo. The frequency with which diastolic BP increased above these limits was less during the atenolol period. The difference in BP between a hospital casual reading and the mean 24 hour ambulatory reading was reduced only by atenolol. Furthermore, only atenolol suppressed the BP and pulse rate increases on exercise.",

The aim of this study was to compare the acute effects of captopril, an ACE inhibitor, and nifedipine, a calcium channel blocker, on exercise-induced microalbuminuria in hypertensive insulin-dependent (Type I) and non-insulin-dependent (Type II) diabetic patients with early stage nephropathy. Non-obese diabetic patients, 13 Type I (7 with stage II and 6 with stage III nephropathy) and 14 Type II (6 with stage II and 8 with stage III nephropathy), with hypertension, WHO stages I-II, underwent five submaximal cycloergometric tests: the first two in basal conditions, the other three after 24 hour administration of captopril (25 mg twice daily), placebo (1 tab twice daily) or nifedipine AR (20 mg twice daily) according to a randomised, double-blind design. Acute administration of both captopril and nifedipine was able to reduce exercise-induced microalbuminuria in hypertensive Type I and Type II diabetic patients regardless of the stage of their nephropathy. Captopril reduced systolic blood pressure less than nifedipine, in both Type I and Type II diabetics, but was more effective than nifedipine in blunting exercise-induced microalbuminuria, especially in Type I diabetics.", 
    "443": "Cardiac failure is the principal medium-term complication of myocardial infarction. Changes in left ventricular geometry are observed after infarction, called ventricular remodeling, which, though compensatory initially, cause ventricular failure in the long-term. Experimental and clinical studies suggest that early treatment by coronary recanalisation, trinitrin and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors may prevent or limit the expansion and left ventricular dilatation after infarction, so improving ventricular function, and, at least in the animal, reduce mortality. Large scale trials with converting enzyme inhibitors are currently under way to determine the effects of this new therapeutic option. It would seem possible at present, independently of any reduction in the size of the infarction, to reduce or delay left ventricular dysfunction by interfering with the natural process of dilatation and ventricular modeling after infarction.", 
    "444": "The discovery and clinical availability of ACE inhibitor drugs is a triumph of rational drug development and a land-mark in biochemical pharmacology and hypertension research. The clinical pharmacological properties and haemodynamics of the clinically available drugs, captopril and enalapril, are reviewed, as is their therapeutic efficacy in African patients with essential and renal hypertension and chronic congestive heart failure. ACE inhibitors act as balanced arteriolar vasodilators and venular dilators and do not excite a reflex tachycardia in contrast to other vasodilator drugs. Their efficacy is, at least in part, dependent on plasma renin activity, which is low in Blacks and in Africans. Consistent with this, is the poor response to ACE inhibitor monotherapy of essential hypertension in controlled studies in Africans. However, the compensatory neuroendocrine activation which occurs in malignant hypertension, renal failure and congestive heart failure and concurrent diuretic therapy appears to enhance the clinical response to ACE inhibitors in African patients.", 
    "445": "The authors describe in a review the use of inhibitors of the angiotensin converting enzyme, in particular enalapril, in the treatment of nephrogenic hypertension, glomerulopathies without hypertension, renovascular hypertension with unilateral or bilateral stenosis of the renal artery and diabetic nephropathy. They draw attention to specific traits in the treatment of different disorders, risk of treatment and the ensuing tactics of indication, dosage and monitoring.", 
    "446": "Intraperitoneal application of p-chloroamphetamine (PCA) is considered a suitable probe for investigation of central serotoninergic control on renin release in the rat, although it causes several behavioral and autonomic changes including negative water balance (increased urination and loss of body weight). The possibility that PCA-induced renin release is secondary to the alterations in water balance was investigated 1 hour after intraperitoneal PCA in male Wistar (Wi) (Experiment I). Long-Evans (LE) and diabetes insipidus (DI) (Experiment II), DI rats pretreated by the inhibitor of angiotensin I-converting enzyme captopril (Experiment III), and water-loaded or propranolol-pretreated Wi rats (Experiment IV). PCA treatment induced significant body weight loss, increase in hematocrit, stimulation of renin-aldosterone system (RAS) and elevation of plasma creatinine level. A toxic damage of the kidney and liver was documented histologically 72 h after 5 mg/kg PCA in Wi rats. The blockade of PCA-induced stimulation of RAS (by captopril or propranolol) markedly potentiated the attendant negative water balance, whereas positive water balance (oral water load) abolished PCA-induced renin secretion. In conclusion, intraperitoneal PCA is an unsuitable probe for investigation of central serotoninergic control on renin release in the rat since PCA-induced renin release is caused by the attendant negative water balance.", 
    "447": "Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) that underwent uninephrectomy (UNX) at six weeks of age were randomly assigned to receive no treatment, the calcium channel blocker, nifedipine, or the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril. Both drugs reduced systemic blood pressure, however, blood pressure tended to be greater in rats given nifedipine than in those on enalapril. After six months, proteinuria and the relevance of glomerula sclerosis were significantly reduced in the two treated groups compared to values observed in untreated SHR. Kidney weight was also reduced by therapy, suggesting that both enalapril and nifedipine inhibited compensatory kidney growth. Micropuncture studies performed in similarly treated groups of rats, but at 11 weeks of age, revealed that PGC was elevated in untreated UNX SHR and reduced by both nifedipine and enalapril. These findings support the hypothesis that glomerular hypertension and renal hypertrophy are important risk factors for glomerular injury. They suggest that calcium blockers are as effective as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in preventing progressive kidney damage.", 
    "448": "Captopril when administered intracerebroventricularly (icv) in doses of 100, 300, 500 and 1000 micrograms induced a dose dependent antinociceptive effect in rats. Naloxone pretreatment (10 mg/kg, ip) completely antagonised antinociceptive effect of captopril, suggesting thereby the involvement of brain enkephalinergic system. Captopril 300 micrograms, icv potentiated the antinociceptive effect of morphine in intact animals. The bilateral adrenalectomy did not have any effect on this potentiation as against the reported blockade of potentiation in adrenalectomized animals when captopril was administered by systemic route. Thus potentiation of morphine induced antinociception by icv captopril is unlikely to be exerted through an effect on adrenal function and is most likely due to increased brain enkephalin levels.", 
    "449": "We investigated whether inhibition of neutral endopeptidase 24.11 (NEP) and/or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) modifies vagally induced nonadrenergic noncholinergic (NANC) airflow obstruction and airway microvascular leakage as measured by extravasation of Evans blue dye (intravenous) in anesthetized guinea pigs. We gave phosphoramidon to inhibit NEP and enalapril maleate or captopril to inhibit ACE. Animals pretreated with inhaled phosphoramidon (7.5 or 75 nmol), enalapril maleate (87 or 870 nmol), or captopril (350 nmol) reached higher peak lung resistance (RL) values (14.3 +/- 2.7, 15.7 +/- 3.8, 16.7 +/- 3.8, 11.4 +/- 1.6, and 24.6 +/- 3.5 cmH2O.ml-1.s, respectively) than saline-treated animals (5.9 +/- 1.1; P less than 0.05) after bilateral vagus nerve stimulation (5 Hz, 10 V, 10 ms, 150 s). Intravenous phosphoramidon (1 mg/kg), but not intravenous captopril (6 mg/kg), potentiated peak RL (22.9 +/- 6.9 and 7.1 +/- 1.5 cmH2O.ml-1.s, respectively). Vagal nerve stimulation (1 and 5 Hz) increased the extravasation of Evans blue dye in tracheobronchial tissues compared with sham-stimulated animals, but this was not potentiated by inhaled enzyme inhibitors or intravenous captopril. However, intravenous phosphoramidon significantly augmented the extravasation of Evans blue dye in main bronchi and intrapulmonary airways. We conclude that degradative enzymes regulate both NANC-induced airflow obstruction and airway microvascular leakage.", 
    "450": "Previous studies have shown that hydropenic one-kidney, one-clip (1-K, 1-C) hypertensive HT rats exhibit impaired autoregulation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in response to reduced arterial perfusion pressure. We investigated the possible role of altered tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) activity in this phenomenon. Uninephrectomized Wistar rats were studied acutely 3 weeks after placing silver clips (0.2 mm) on the renal artery. Experiments were performed in 1-K,1-C HT rats and in uninephrectomized control animals. TGF activity was assessed as changes in proximal tubule stop-flow pressure (SFP) in response to orthograde microperfusion from 0 to 80 nl/min into late proximal tubule segments. Only the highest perfusion rates (approximately 40 nl/min) into late proximal tubule segments resulted in maximal decreases in SFP, indicating a marked rightward shift of overall TGF activity in 1-K,1-C HT rats. Similar responses were observed in the uninephrectomized animals. In contrast, changes of SFP were observed at lower perfusion rates in normal animals and maximal responses were observed at perfusion rates of approximately 20 nl/min. These observations are consistent with the possibility that altered TGF activity contributes to impaired autoregulation of GFR in 1-K,1-C HT rats in response to reduced renal perfusion pressure. In response to treatment with i.v. captopril, the 1-K,1-C HT rats exhibited marked decreases in systemic arterial pressure associated with decreases in SFP and virtually complete inhibition of TGF activity. It is attractive to hypothesize that these alterations in TGF characteristics in the 1-K,1-C HT rats play a significant pathophysiologic role in the acute renal dysfunction observed in response to acute decreases of blood pressure during conditions of augmented angiotensin activity. Additional future studies will allow us to address the precise role for intrarenal angiotensin in these phenomena.",

Fifteen healthy white male volunteers aged 22-42 and weighing 135-225 lbs took digoxin tablets 0.25 mg every 12 hours for 5 weeks. In crossover design, each also received spirapril or matching placebo capsules during weeks 1 and 2, or 4 and 5. Dosage of spirapril was increased from 12 mg to 48 mg once daily. Spirapril produced no significant effect on mean (+/- SD) serum digoxin concentration in the steady state, area under curve for 12 hours, peak digoxin level, time to peak, or urinary digoxin excretion over 12 hours. No change in renal or whole body digoxin clearance was seen. Unlike some other cardiovascular drugs, spirapril does not alter steady-state digoxin kinetics in healthy adults.", 
    "452": "Since the introduction of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors into the adjunctive treatment of patients with congestive heart failure, cases of severe hypotension, especially on the first day of treatment, have occasionally been reported. To assess the safety of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril a multicenter, open, randomized, prazosin-controlled trial was designed comparing the incidence and severity of symptomatic hypotension on the first day of treatment. Trial medication was 2.5 mg enalapril or 0.5 mg prazosin. Subjects were 1210 inpatients with New York Heart Association functional class (I)/II and III who were not adequately compensated with digitalis and/or diuretics. In the group receiving enalapril, 3 patients (0.5%) experienced severe hypotension on day 1 and 28 patients (4.7%) moderate hypotension. In those given prazosin, 15 patients (2.6%) experienced severe hypotension and 60 patients (10.3%) moderate hypotension. The difference is statistically significant (P less than or equal to 0.000012). All patients recovered. It was concluded that treatment of patients suffering from congestive heart failure New York Heart Association functional class (I)/II or III with enalapril is comparably well tolerated.",

Both treatments significantly (P less than .001) lowered blood pressure, reducing systemic vascular resistances. After 3 months both drugs induced a comparable percentage of reduction in LV mass, with an increase in the peak rate of LV relaxation and no changes in the peak rate of LV contraction. Our results demonstrate that perindopril once daily is an effective antihypertensive agent; it is also able, like captopril, to induce regression of LV hypertrophy, with improvement in diastolic performance and no deterioration in ventricular systolic function.",

Both peak systolic and diastolic velocities were measured at renal hilum and at arcuate arteries, and the resistive index (RI) was calculated.

    "464": "To study the effects of a novel angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) on hypertension-induced cardiac hypertrophy, benazepril hydrochloride (CGS 14824 A, CAS 86541-74-4) at the dose of 3 and 10 mg/kg/d p.o. was administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats from 4 to 16 weeks of age. In addition to suppression of developing blood pressure, benazepril hydrochloride reduced both the wet weights of whole heart and left ventricle dose-dependently and significantly. Benazepril hydrochloride had no effect on hydroxyproline concentration and content or protein concentration in the left ventricle, whereas is reduced the total protein content dose-dependently. Serum ACE activity was significantly reduced at 10 mg/kg/d of benazepril hydrochloride, but renin activity, aldosterone and noradrenaline concentration in serum were not changed. From the microscopic findings of the left ventricle, benazepril hydrochloride reduced the myocardial hypertrophy significantly. From these results, benazepril hydrochloride seems to suppress the increase in volume load by acting through the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and dose not seem to cause a significant reflex of catecholamine which often occurs with peripheral vessels dilation. Thus, benazepril hydrochloride may be expected to suppress cardiac hypertrophy in patients with hypertension.",

Two hundred and twenty-five patients with mild to moderate heart failure were studied in four parallel treatment groups receiving either placebo or quinapril in a dose of 10, 20, or 40 mg day-1. Compared to placebo, quinapril therapy resulted in a significant improvement in exercise time. The improvement in exercise tolerance was dose-related and showed a significant increase at the end of the study in the patients who completed the trial and in an intent-to-treat analysis. Twenty-six patients were on monotherapy with quinapril without concomitant medication. In this subgroup of patients, the increase in exercise time was comparable to the subgroup of patients on diuretic treatment alone. After the 12-week study, 189 patients entered an open-label trial for 12 months, in which the dose of the ACE inhibitor could be adjusted according to clinical response. Despite a reduction in the daily dose of quinapril, the patients reached the same level of exercise capacity as in the 3-month study. No serious side effects were recorded, particularly no symptomatic hypotension or deterioration of renal function. The results of the study show that quinapril has a significant favourable effect on exercise tolerance and symptoms in patients with mild to moderate heart failure.", 
    "477": "In anesthetized rats with sinoaortic denervation, intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) resulted in decreased mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) (depressor effects), whereas icv angiotensin II (ANG II) produced increases in these variables (pressor effects). The depressor effects of ANP were slower in onset and longer in duration than the pressor effects of ANG II. Intracerebroventricular injection of the ANG II-receptor blocker sarthran or the ANG II-synthesis inhibitor captopril resulted in a significant reduction in MAP; HR and RSNA were not affected. Both sarthran and captopril abolished the depressor responses to icv ANP. In contrast, injection of an anti-rat ANP antibody, which blocked the depressor effects of icv ANP, did not by itself modify MAP, HR, or RSNA, nor did the antibody affect the pressor responses to icv ANG II. These data suggest that, in this animal model, the depressor effects of icv ANP are mediated by the inhibition of brain ANG II-dependent neural activity. These results also demonstrate that, in this preparation, the endogenous ANG II system actively contributes to the maintenance of basal MAP, whereas the central ANP system, at least in regions accessible to the antirat ANP antibody, plays little role in this maintenance.", 
    "478": "Six control dogs, six dogs treated with 1.5 mg/kg b.i.d. quinapril, and six dogs treated with 8 mg/kg q.d. minoxidil underwent 6 hours daily of hindquarter compression for 9 weeks. Minoxidil significantly decreased baseline blood pressure (-17 mm Hg; p less than or equal to 0.01), whereas quinapril decreased baseline blood pressure 11 mm Hg but not significantly (p = 0.15). Hindquarter compression elicited blood pressure increases in all three groups (control +18, quinapril +13, minoxidil +19 mm Hg). After 9 weeks, left ventricular mass in control dogs increased 22% (p less than 0.004); a similar increase was seen in minoxidil-treated dogs (+22%, p less than 0.0001) but not in the quinapril-treated group (+4%, p less than 0.15). The increase in left ventricular mass in control dogs was concentric (increased epicardial volume only), whereas in the minoxidil group, the hypertrophy was eccentric (both epicardial and endocardial volumes increased). The minimal hypertrophy in the quinapril group was concentric (no change in epicardial, but a decrease in endocardial volume). Quinapril had little hypotensive effect, but prevented the development of left ventricular hypertrophy, whereas minoxidil did not prevent hypertrophy in spite of its hypotensive effect. The mechanism of this differential effect of direct vasodilation versus converting enzyme inhibition on left ventricular hypertrophy is not fully elucidated. The results with quinapril suggest that some antihypertensive agents may positively affect left ventricular hypertrophy in spite of the absence of a large effect on baseline blood pressure or on blood pressure reactivity.",

In both groups, 3 patients had no incidents of angina after 1-h nitroglycerin infusion. An additional 6 patients resolved their complaints after captopril administration in contrast to only 1 after placebo.

    "480": "We studied the effects of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on cough responses to bradykinin (BK), substance P (SP) and citric acid in a double blind, random study on 10 hypertensive patients receiving ACE inhibitors. Of these patients, five had reported cough with ACE inhibitors. Cough responses to citric acid were similar between patients with and without cough, and SP up to 10(-5) M did not cause cough in any of the subjects. BK caused cough at 13.4 +/- 1.2 (-log M) in 5 patients with cough associated with ACE inhibitors, but it did not cause cough at concentrations up to 10(-5) M in other 5 patients. One month after the withdrawal of ACE inhibitors, 5 patients were free from cough symptoms, and BK did not cause cough up to 10(-5) M in these patients, except for one who coughed at 10(-9) M, without changes in responses to citric acid. BK caused cough at 14.3 +/- 0.7 (-log M) although BK1-7, a major metabolite of BK by ACE, caused cough at 5.7 +/- 0.7 (-log M) in another 3 patients with cough associated with ACE inhibitor. These results suggest that impaired metabolism of BK induced by ACE inhibitors may relate to the manifestation of cough in hypertensive patients receiving ACE inhibitors.", 
    "481": "Polyamines are thought to play an essential role in cellular hypertrophy and proliferation. Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) catalyzes the first and probably the rate-limiting step in biosynthesis of polyamines. In this study, we evaluated the pathophysiological role of the renin-angiotensin system in isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy, using myocardial ODC activity as an indicator of cardiac hypertrophy. Isoproterenol caused an eight-fold increase of myocardial ODC activity in normotensive Wistar rats within 4 h after injection. Captopril suppressed the induction of ODC by isoproterenol to two-thirds of the control level. These results indicate that the renin-angiotensin system may participate in the induction of myocardial hypertrophy by isoproterenol.", 
    "482": "Clearances of uncharged dextrans of broad size distribution were used to evaluate the effects of a 30 day course of enalapril on glomerular barrier function in 10 patients with IgA nephropathy and proteinuria (from 1.4 to 5.6 g/day). Dextran clearance experiments were repeated three times: before enalapril therapy, after 30 days of enalapril and again 30 days after enalapril withdrawal. GFR, but not RPF, was significantly reduced by enalapril (basal 38.3 +/- 11.9, enalapril 30.2 +/- 12.6 ml/min/1.73 m2) and returned to basal values after enalapril withdrawal. Urinary protein excretion and fractional clearance of albumin were both significantly reduced by enalapril (basal 2.3 +/- 1.1 g/day and 102 +/- 90 x 10(-5), enalapril 1.2 +/- 0.6 g/day and 51 +/- 23 x 10(-5), respectively) and returned to basal values after enalapril withdrawal. Transglomerular passage of large dextrans (radii 54 to 62 A), but not of lower size (26 to 42 A) were significantly lowered by enalapril. When enalapril was withdrawn the dextran-sieving profile returned comparable to the baseline levels. A theoretical analysis of dextran-sieving profiles indicated that enalapril lowered the radius of largest membrane pores. This effect was independent from glomerular hemodynamic changes. We conclude that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (CEI) in humans with IgA nephropathy reduces urinary protein excretion by a primary action on the intrinsic glomerular membrane properties enhancing barrier size-selective function. The hypofiltration associated with enalapril therapy in these patients, which was eliminated by its withdrawal, has to be taken into account as a possible undesired effect of CEI in long-term treatment.", 
    "483": "To determine the roles of endogenously released tachykinins (substance P, neurokinins A and B) in human bronchial tissues, and to determine the roles of enkephalinase (neutral endopeptidase, E.C. 3.4.24.11) in regulating the effects of the tachykinins, we studied the effects of substance P and capsaicin, which releases tachykinins, on human bronchial smooth muscle contraction in the presence or absence of enkephalinase inhibitor phosphoramidon in vitro. Substance P alone caused human bronchial smooth muscle contraction at 10(-6) M or more. Phosphoramidon (10(-7) to 10(-5) M) potentiated the substance P-induced contraction in a dose-dependent fashion, and phosphoramidon shifted the dose-response curve to lower concentrations. Capsaicin (10(-5) or 10(-4) M) alone caused bronchial smooth muscle contraction in four tissues from nine patients. After the contraction by capsaicin reached a plateau, phosphoramidon (10(-5) M) increased and prolonged the contraction significantly. Furthermore, pretreatment of bronchial tissues with phosphoramidon (10(-5) M) potentiated capsaicin-induced contraction in all tissues from five patients. Phosphoramidon (10(-5) M) shifted the dose-response curve to capsaicin to lower concentrations more than 1 log unit. Captopril did not alter the contractile response to substance P, suggesting that angiotensin-converting enzyme does not regulate the contractile response to substance P in human bronchial smooth muscle in vitro. These results suggest that enkephalinase regulates the contractile effects of exogenous substance P and endogenous substances, probably tachykinins, released by capsaicin in the human bronchus.",

The pharmacokinetics of the metabolite, cilazaprilat, after a single dose of 0.5 mg cilazapril were similar to previous observations in healthy volunteers at identical dosage. Repeat administration, however, led to greater accumulation than previously observed in volunteers at the higher dosages of 1.25 or 5 mg given for 8 days. Seven patients experienced adverse events. Four were severe, leading to withdrawal of the patients from the study, but only one event was related to cilazapril.

In addition to subjective evidence derived from patient reports, a large number of investigations have now been published which attempt to objectively assess the influence of antihypertensive medication on behavioral or cognitive performance. This paper summarizes and critically evaluates experimental studies of the effect of antihypertensive medication on subjects' performance of neuropsychological tasks and reviews the pharmacologic mechanisms by which these drugs may affect behavior. The literature is incomplete in its assessment of all domains of neuropsychological performance and all drug classes, and methodologic deficiencies are common. Nonetheless, the consensus of all studies and the findings of well-designed studies in particular do not identify any notable areas of performance impairment in patients receiving antihypertensive medication. Moreover, results suggest that, in certain instances, drug treatment may even enhance performance. In light of the limitations of the literature, however, an adequate understanding of the effects of antihypertensive therapy on behavioral functioning awaits completion of large, well-designed investigations including all major drug classes and thorough neurobehavioral assessments.", 
    "486": "We studied the role of the sympathetic nervous system and the renin angiotensin system for pressure induced left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in 135 rats with experimental supravalvular aortic stenosis (AS). We induced this condition by a silver clip on the ascending aorta, when body weight (BW) was 90 to 100 g. Sympathectomy by 6-OH-dopamine reduced LV norepinephrine content to less than 5%. The renin-angiotensin system was blocked by quinapril, which reduced serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity to less than 5%. Aortic stenosis (LV peak systolic pressure 212 +/- 10 mm Hg) induced significant LVH with an increase of LV weight from 198 +/- 3 (sham) to 266 +/- 6 after 6 weeks and to 303 +/- 13 mg/100 g body weight after 12 weeks. Sympathectomy did not reduce LVH 6 weeks after induction of AS (260 +/- 6 mg/100 g body weight). Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition initiated immediately after induction of AS did not alter the increase of LV mass after 6 weeks (250 +/- 7 mg/100 g body weight). Removing the silver clip 6 weeks after induction of AS resulted in a 90% regression of LVH after 6 more weeks. When ACE-inhibition was started after 6 weeks--ie, once LVH had developed--and maintained for another 6 weeks, an 80% regression of LVH was observed despite the persistent afterload elevation. Our findings of an afterload independent regression of LVH by ACE-inhibition emphasize an important role of the renin angiotensin system for the maintenance of pressure induced LVH.", 
    "487": "In a double-blind, parallel-group multicentre study in general practice, lisinopril (10-20 mg once daily) was compared with metoprolol (100-200 mg once daily) in 360 patients whose diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was in the range 91-115 mmHg despite diuretic treatment. Following a three week run-in period during which the diuretic was withdrawn, monotherapy with either lisinopril or metoprolol was given for two months with dose doubled after one month if DBP remained greater than 90 mmHg. Quality of life was assessed using established and validated questionnaires at the time of cessation of diuretic treatment and again after two months's active treatment. Both metoprolol and lisinopril achieved statistically significant BP reduction relative to baseline (P less than 0.001). Significantly fewer adverse events were experienced on lisinopril and metoprolol than on diuretic treatment. Frequency of withdrawals due to adverse events were statistically significantly lower on lisinopril than metoprolol P = 0.01. Before treatment approximately 35% of the patients had quality of life problems measured by General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), which was reduced to 17% on lisinopril and 23% on metoprolol. Thus both metoprolol and lisinopril were effective and safe in the treatment of mild to moderate essential hypertension with lisinopril being better tolerated. From patients' self-assessments of quality of life, lisinopril was found to be superior to metoprolol in some aspects of emotional, cognitive and social functioning.", 
    "488": "The overflow of endogenous angiotensin-(1-8)octapeptide (angiotensin II) from blood-perfused canine gracilis muscle vasculature in situ was studied. A positive veno-arterial concentration difference for angiotensin II over the gracilis muscle was found, indicating a net generation of angiotensin II under basal conditions. Angiotensin II levels in the venous effluent were elevated during 2 Hz (4-min) nerve stimulation, suggesting enhanced local angiotensin II generation both in the presence and absence of alpha-adrenoceptor blockade. Thus, our results in this in vivo model demonstrate a local overflow of angiotensin II from the skeletal muscle vasculature which can be enhanced by nerve stimulation. Whether this overflow of angiotensin II is due to conversion of circulating angiotensin I to angiotensin II or local de novo synthesis of angiotensin II remains to be established.", 
    "489": "Hemodynamic effects and inhibitory effects on the pressor response to exogenous angiotensin I of benazepril (CGS 14824A), a new angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, were examined in conscious chronically instrumented normotensive dogs in comparison with those of captorpil. Oral administration of benazepril (1-10 mg/kg) and captopril (3 and 10 mg/kg) reduced the blood pressure and inhibited the pressor response to angiotensin I dose-dependently. The blood-pressure-lowering effect of benazepril was as potent as that of captopril. The onset of effects of benazepril was slower and the duration longer than that of captopril. There was no close correlation between the attenuation of pressor response to exogenous angiotensin I and the blood-pressure-lowering effect of these two agents. These results indicate that benazepril is a potent ACE inhibitor with a slow onset and a long duration. The slow onset of action may be explained by the necessity of prior conversion of this compound to an active metabolite. A mechanism or mechanisms other than that responsible for the inhibition of pressor response to exogenous angiotensin I must be taken into consideration to explain the blood-pressure-lowering effects of benazepril and captopril.", 
    "490": "The mechanisms influencing arterial blood pressure and heart rate were studied in conscious foxhounds after chronic sino-aortic and cardiopulmonary denervation (N = 6). In previous investigations it was shown, that this denervation produces hypertension and tachycardia, which is confirmed by the present study: Mean arterial blood pressure increased from 101 +/- 3 to 123 +/- 6 mmHg (P less than 0.05), and heart rate rose from 85 +/- 6 to 124 +/- 5 beats min-1 (P less than 0.001). The variability of mean arterial blood pressure, but not that of heart rate increased (from 6 +/- 1 to 22 +/- 2 mmHg (P less than 0.001). The administration of the alpha-adrenergic blocker prazosin reduced both mean arterial blood pressure (-33 +/- 8 mmHg, P less than 0.01) and its variability (-12 +/- 1 mmHg, P less than 0.01), thus suggesting an alpha-adrenergic mediated hypertension. beta-blockade by propranolol blunted the heart rate increase (-24 +/- 5 beats min-1, P less than 0.05). Although plasma renin activity increased in the denervated dogs, converting enzyme inhibition had little effect on mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate. In conclusion, chronic sino-aortic and cardiopulmonary denervation enhances the alpha and beta-adrenergic component of cardiovascular control in a different fashion. While the alpha-adrenergic component induces fluctuations around an elevated arterial blood pressure level, the beta-adrenergic tone to the heart increases without any significant increase in variability.", 
    "491": "Cough is a recognised side effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors although its exact mechanism is still unknown. Reports on the side effect of ACE inhibitors on asthma have been conflicting. These drugs either had no effect on bronchial reactivity or resulted in an increase in pre-existing hyperreactivity. We report a case of a non-asthmatic patient who had lisinopril-induced cough and bronchial hyperreactivity.", 
    "492": "The relationship between sulfhydryls and cGMP has been observed in several biological processes. Captopril is a sulfhydryl-containing angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, that decreases PGI2 production in cultured human vascular endothelial cells. Enalapril does not appear to have this property. The role of cyclic GMP (cGMP) and sulfhydryls in the regulatory mechanisms in captopril-induced PGI2 production and Ca++ kinetics was investigated. Bradykinin and Ca ionophore A23187 enhanced PGI2 production, and increased the cytosolic free Ca++ concentration ([Ca++]i). It was observed that 8-bromo cGMP increased intracellular cGMP concentration ([Ca++]i), and decreased PGI2 production without changing [Ca++]i. Sulfhydryl containing compounds such as captopril, N-acetylcysteine and glutathione decreased PGI2 production via increased [cGMP]i. Enalapril, an ACE inhibitor without sulfhydryls, has no effect on PGI2 production, [Ca++]i and [cGMP]i. These results suggested that the presence of sulfhydryl groups is an important factor in the ability of vasoactive substances to induce PGI2 production.", 
    "493": "We determined the relationship between cardiac angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and anti-ischemic efficacy of several structurally different ACE inhibitors or their prodrug esters perfused through the isolated rat heart. Seven ACE inhibitors inhibited cardiac ACE to varying degrees due to differences in uptake during perfusion through nonischemic rat hearts. Zofenopril-sulfhydryl and fosinoprilic acid were the most effective of the free inhibitors. Among the prodrugs, zofenopril and S-benzoylcaptopril, hydrolyzed rapidly by cardiac esterase, were more effective than their component ACE-inhibitors, whereas fosinopril, ramipril and enalapril were poorly active. For studies in ischemic rat hearts, vehicle or drug treatment was initiated 10 min before a 25-min period of global ischemia and during a 30-min reperfusion period. Of five unesterified ACE inhibitors studied for anti-ischemic activity, only captopril and zofenopril-sulfhydryl were found to improve postischemic contractile function and reduce cell death in the isolated rat hearts. Fosinoprilic acid, ramiprilat and enalaprilat were not cardioprotective at high perfusion concentrations, despite the fact that nearly complete inhibition of cardiac ACE was achieved with all of the compounds studied. The S-benzoyl prodrugs of zofenopril-sulfhydryl and captopril were at least as potent as their component ACE inhibitors in reducing ischemic-reperfusion damage in the same model. Neither zofenopril nor captopril, however, had any effect on coronary flow before or after ischemia. Thus, it appears that the cardioprotective effects of zofenopril and captopril are independent of cardiac ACE inhibition or, at least, that ACE inhibition alone is not sufficient. Both captopril and zofenopril are sulfhydryl-containing compounds whereas the inactive compounds are not; and, thus, this group appears to be important in mediating their cardioprotective actions.", 
    "494": "Captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, reportedly can scavenge superoxide anion (O2-), a property attributed to its sulfhydryl group. The present investigation, using rabbit aortic rings precontracted with either norepinephrine or clonidine, was designed to determine whether captopril possesses an endothelium-dependent component of vasodilation related to its ability to protect endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) from superoxide-mediated destruction. Also studied were enalaprilat, a nonsulfhydryl angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitor, superoxide dismutase, and the sulfhydryl compounds glutathione (GSH), N-2-mercaptopropionylglycine (MPG) and N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Captopril, but not enalaprilat, caused dose-dependent relaxations in preconstricted aortic rings containing an intact endothelium. Rings denuded of endothelium were unresponsive to any dose of captopril. Captopril's vasodilation was not related to prostaglandin influence but was associated with an increase in cyclic GMP. Superoxide dismutase, GSH, MPG and NAC also produced endothelium-dependent relaxations similar to captopril. It was also demonstrated that endothelium-dependent relaxations to acetylcholine were enhanced by captopril, GSH, MPG and NAC but not by enalaprilat. In another set of experiments, the ability of captopril to inhibit superoxide-mediated inactivation of EDRF was examined. Pyrogallol, a potent generator of O2-, and superoxide dismutase, a scavenger of O2-, were used as a basis for comparing a possible scavenging effect of captopril. In preconstricted rings, pyrogallol elicited endothelium-dependent contractions that were attenuated by both captopril and superoxide dismutase. Similar effects were found with GSH, MPG and NAC but not with enalaprilat. These results suggest that captopril's endothelium-dependent vasodilation is due to its sulfhydryl group and the ability of the latter to scavenge O2-, thereby protecting EDRF.", 
    "495": "The role of angiotensin II and kinins on the renal cortical and papillary hemodynamic and on the sodium and water excretory responses to converting enzyme inhibition with captopril was examined in euvolemic Munich-Wistar rats. Cortical and papillary blood flows were measured using a laser Doppler flowmeter. Cortical blood flow increased 28% after blockade of angiotensin II receptors with DuP 753 (2 mg/kg i.v., n = 6). Captopril (2 mg/kg i.v., n = 6) had no effect on cortical blood flow in rats pretreated with the angiotensin II antagonist. DuP 753 had no effect on papillary blood flow, nor did it prevent the rise in papillary blood flow produced by captopril (2 mg/kg, n = 6). Infusion of a kinin receptor antagonist, D-Arg, [Hyp3,Thi5,8,D-Phe7]-bradykinin (2.5 micrograms/min i.v.), reduced basal papillary blood flow by 15% and blocked the rise in papillary blood flow produced by captopril. Renal blood flow rose by 11% after DuP 753 (2 mg/kg, n = 6), and subsequent administration of captopril and the kinin antagonist had no effect on renal blood flow. Urine flow and sodium excretion increased after DuP 753, but captopril produced additional increases in urine flow and sodium excretion of 68% and 46% respectively. Fractional sodium excretion rose from 0.85 +/- 0.15% to 1.56 +/- 0.14% after captopril. Infusion of the kinin antagonist returned sodium and water excretion to control levels, but fractional sodium excretion was not significantly altered. Glomerular filtration rate was not altered by DuP 753 or captopril; however, it fell from 1.6 +/- 0.1 to 1.2 +/- 0.1 ml/min/g kidney wt during infusion of the kinin antagonist.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "496": "This study was performed to determine divided renal efferent sympathetic nerve activity from kidneys in seven patients with renin-positive, unilateral renal artery stenosis before and 30 minutes after an acute intravenous dose of 1.25 mg enalaprilat. Renal norepinephrine release was calculated from split renal plasma flow, venoarterial plasma concentration gradients across the kidney, and the fractional extraction of tritiated norepinephrine. All patients had unilateral renin secretion, the affected kidney increasing its plasma renin activity gradient 1.7-fold, whereas no statistically significant change was noted on the contralateral side in response to enalaprilat. Total norepinephrine release to plasma and norepinephrine plasma clearance (assessed by isotope dilution) were similar before and after administration of enalaprilat (approximately 400 ng/min and 1.0 l/min), despite a 26% fall in mean arterial pressure (from 125 mm Hg, p less than 0.01). Heart rate remained unchanged. After enalaprilat, norepinephrine venoarterial difference increased in the renin-secreting kidney (from 264 to 396, SED = 57 pg/ml, p less than 0.05), whereas it increased only slightly in the contralateral kidney (from 149 to 256, SED = 72 pg/ml, NS). Tritiated norepinephrine extraction fell approximately 25% (p less than 0.01) in both kidneys. Thus, renal norepinephrine spillover increased from 49 to 62, SED = 9 ng/min (NS) and from 81 to 129, SED = 17 ng/min (p less than 0.05) from the affected and the contralateral kidney, respectively. Hence, in this relatively small study in patients with renovascular hypertension, no evidence for increased renal nerve activity could be observed in the affected kidney, despite its marked renin production.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "497": "The responses to angiotensinogen, angiotensinogen-(1-14) (tetradecapeptide, TDP), angiotensin I, and angiotensin II and the effect of the renin inhibitor, CH-66, the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, perindopril, and the receptor antagonist, saralasin, were investigated in isolated femoral resistance arteries of the rat. The response to angiotensinogen in the presence of kallikrein was also investigated. Angiotensin I and TDP elicited a contraction which was not reduced by CH-66 but was inhibited by perindopril and saralasin. The response to angiotensinogen was small and not blocked by saralasin but the response to angiotensinogen that was mixed with renin for a few seconds was saralasin-sensitive and perindopril and CH-66 showed a tendency to block this response. The response to angiotensinogen was enhanced in the presence of kallikrein. These results suggest (1) the presence of a partial renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in this preparation, (2) that TDP is not converted via renin while both angiotensin I and TDP are converted through ACE in this preparation and (3) that the responses to angiotensinogen and TDP are different.", 
    "498": "The effect of captopril on vascular prostacyclin production was studied, evaluating which of its components--sulfhydryl (SH) group or proline--is responsible for this effect. Rat aortas were incubated with captopril (10-100 microM), 2-mercaptoethanol or proline (10 microM), and captopril plus the SH-binding reagents N-ethylmaleimide or ethacrynic acid (50 microM). Prostacyclin was measured by radioimmunoassay of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha. Captopril stimulated prostacyclin production. This effect was associated with an enhanced conversion of arachidonate to prostacyclin and was not related to bradykinin. Since 2-mercaptoethanol increased vascular prostacyclin per se and proline did not, the stimulatory effect of captopril appears to be dependent upon the SH group; in addition, both SH blockers, N-ethylmaleimide and ethacrynic acid, antagonized this effect. This study shows that captopril stimulates vascular prostacyclin synthesis directly and that the SH group plays a key role in this action. This stimulation of prostacyclin synthesis may contribute to the antihypertensive action of captopril.", 
    "499": "In a group of 237 hypertensive male and female physicians, a placebo-controlled randomized double-blind, cross-over trial was performed to investigate the effects of the ACE inhibitor captopril on blood pressure and well-being. A thoroughly tested standardized measurement of well-being was employed. On the basis of the multivariate linear model, differences in the response to treatment (t-tests for cross-over differences) were investigated in terms of the seven parameters of well-being measured. In comparison with placebo, captopril (50 mg once daily) had a significant effect on five of the seven parameters. Thus, mood, general well-being, work performance, regeneration and quality of sleep all improved under treatment. It was also found that these improvements were not an immediate consequence of blood pressure reduction. The standardized evaluation employed here thus proved to be an informative additional evaluation criterion of antihypertensive therapy.", 
    "500": "Almost 50 percent of patients with chronic heart failure die of sudden death often due to arrhythmia. In these patients the prognosis is related to the severity of myocardial lesions and also, probably, to the presence of ventricular arrhythmias. The potential severity of which can be assessed by various methods, including ECG, Holter monitoring, late potentials study and programmed ventricular stimulation tests. The first therapeutic measure to improve the prognosis of heart failure is to improve the myocardial function by prescribing converting enzyme inhibitors. The second measure consists of acting on potentially dangerous ventricular arrhythmias with few or no symptoms. Among antiarrhythmic agents, only beta-blockers and amiodarone seem to be valuable."
