    "0": "Monocytes play a critical role in the pathophysiology of heart failure (HF), but few studies have evaluated the prognostic implications of an increased monocyte count in patients with HF and reduced ejection fraction (EF). The Efficacy of Vasopressin Antagonism in Heart Failure Outcome Study with Tolvaptan (EVEREST) examined the effects of tolvaptan in patients with worsening HF and EF \u226440%. This post hoc analysis evaluated the primary end points of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality or HF hospitalization in 3,717 patients. At baseline, 265 (7.1%) had an increased monocyte count defined by \u2265800/\u03bcl. Patients with increased monocyte count tended to have an increased EF and were less likely to have a history of diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, or coronary revascularization but were more likely to have higher HF functional class and to be taking HF therapies such as diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers, and digoxin (p <0.05 for all comparisons). At median follow-up of 9.9 months, increased monocyte count was predictive of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio 1.27, 95% confidence interval 1.003 to 1.60, p = 0.047) but was not associated with cardiovascular mortality or HF hospitalization (hazard ratio 1.06, 95% confidence interval 0.87 to 1.30, p = 0.55). Similar results were seen when monocyte count was analyzed as a continuous variable. However, after adjustment for baseline clinical risk factors, monocyte count was not predictive of either primary end point. In conclusion, increased monocyte count occurs in a minority of patients hospitalized with HF and is associated with poor postdischarge prognosis. However, it does not contribute prognostic value above other more traditional risk factors.", 
    "1": "The functional properties, including antioxidant and chemopreventative capacities as well as the inhibitory effects on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), \u03b1-glucosidase and pancreatic lipase, of three Australian-grown faba bean genotypes (Nura, Rossa and TF(Ic*As)*483/13) were investigated using an array of in vitro assays. Chromatograms of on-line post column derivatisation assay coupled with HPLC revealed the existence of active phenolics (hump) in the coloured genotypes, which was lacking in the white-coloured breeding line, TF(Ic*As)*483/13. Roasting reduced the phenolic content, and diminished antioxidant activity by 10-40 % as measured by the reagent-based assays (diphenylpicrylhydrazyl, 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) and oxygen radical absorbance capacity) in all genotypes. Cell culture-based antioxidant activity assay (cellular antioxidant activity) showed an increase of activity in the coloured genotypes after roasting. Faba bean extracts demonstrated cellular protection ability against H\u2082O\u2082-induced DNA damage (assessed using RAW264.7 cells), and inhibited the proliferation of all human cancer cell lines (BL13, AGS, Hep G2 and HT-29) evaluated. However, the effect of faba bean extracts on the non-transformed human cells (CCD-18Co) was negligible. Flow cytometric analyses showed that faba bean extracts successfully induced apoptosis of HL-60 (acute promyelocytic leukaemia) cells. The faba bean extracts also exhibited ACE, \u03b1-glucosidase and pancreatic lipase inhibitory activities. Overall, extracts from Nura (buff-coloured) and Rossa (red-coloured) were comparable, while TF(Ic*As)*483/13 (white-coloured) contained the lowest phenolic content and exhibited the least antioxidant and enzyme inhibition activities. These results are important to promote the utilisation of faba beans in human diets for various health benefits.", 
    "2": "The typical presentation of heart failure in primary care is insidious, with progressive breathlessness on exertion, ankle swelling, orthopnoea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea. Not all patients will have all these symptoms, and in many patients there may be other causes. If a GP suspects heart failure, then the key blood test is B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP). If the BNP is normal then heart failure is unlikely and other diagnoses should be considered. If it is raised, or if there is a past history of myocardial infarction, the patient requires further assessment, which must include echocardiography and a specialist assessment. The underlying cardiac abnormality should be identified. An ECG is often very useful and if it is completely normal it makes heart failure less likely. Both the NICE and the ESC guidance emphasise the importance of lifestyle management (regular appropriate exercise, avoiding excessive salt and alcohol consumption). ACE inhibitors (or angiotensin receptor blockers) and beta-blockers licensed for heart failure (carvedilol, bisoprolol, nebivolol) remain the mainstay of treatment in addition to as small a dose of diuretic as possible to control any fluid retention. Aldosterone antagonism is recommended by the 2012 ESC guidance for all patients who remain symptomatic despite an ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker. If the rhythm is sinus but the heart rate is 75 beats per minute, therapy needs to be optimised, perhaps by increasing the beta-blocker dose, if possible, or by the addition of ivabradine.",

Although drug interactions can have fatal consequences, few studies have reviewed drug interactions of these classical drugs used in rheumatology, and very few guidelines are available on this subject. Therefore, this report summarizes important interactions of immunosuppressants, antimalarial drugs and glucocorticosteroids with drugs commonly used in internal medicine. In the present study, more than 300 interactions were retrieved from the Micromedex \u00ae database. The selection was reduced to the interactions rated as moderate, major or contraindicated. The selected interactions were further checked against PubMed \u00ae, MEDLINE \u00ae, InfoPharm Compendium of Drug Interactions and Summaries of Product Characteristics. For each interaction, its nature, mechanism, onset and clinical severity were indicated, documentation quality was rated and recommendations for clinical practice were formulated. Twenty significant interactions that we rated as moderate, severe and very severe were identified. Interacting drugs were warfarin, fluoroquinolones, azole antifungals, co-trimoxazole, proton pump inhibitors, amiodarone, cholestyramine, activated carbon, allopurinol, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, statins, digoxin, iron, aluminium and magnesium salts, and hepatotoxic and nephrotoxic agents.",

Three kinds of solvents: a Tris-HCl buffer (80 mM, pH 9.0), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), and acetonitrile were employed in this study. The optimum reaction solvent component was determined by simplex centroid mixture design. The synthesis efficiency was enhanced in an organic-aqueous solvent (Tris-HCl buffer: DMSO: acetonitrile = 2:1:1) in which 73.55% of the yield of N-Ac-Phe-Tyr-NH(2) could be achieved. Furthermore, the effect of reaction parameters on the yield was evaluated by response surface methodology (RSM) using a central composite rotatable design (CCRD). Based on a ridge max analysis, the optimum condition for this peptide synthesis included a reaction time of 7.4 min, a reaction temperature of 28.1\u00b0C, an enzyme activity of 98.9 U, and a substrate molar ratio (Phe:Tyr) of 1:2.8. The predicted and the actual (experimental) yields were 87.6 and 85.5%, respectively. The experimental design and RSM performed well in the optimization of synthesis of N-Ac-Phe-Tyr-NH(2) , so it is expected to be an effective method for obtaining a good yield of enzymatic peptide. \u00a9 2012 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

The PWV of the treatment group (7.5 m/s) after nine months was lower than that of the healthy volunteer group (8.2 m/s) but it was not statistically significant. No correlation between ET-1 and PWV could be found.",

African Americans and women have a higher prevalence of hypertension than white individuals, and in those aged 70 and older, the hypertension was more poorly controlled than in those aged 60-69. The number of trials available in the elderly population compared with the general population are limited; hence, the database for strong recommendations as to goal blood pressure (BP) are limited. The American College of Cardiology with the American Heart Association has recently published a consensus report of management of hypertension in the elderly population. This review presents an overview of this consensus report and reviews specific studies that provide some novel findings regarding goal BP and progression of nephropathy. In general, the evidence strongly supports a BP goal of less than 150/80 mmHg. The evidence review for the consensus report supports a goal of <150/80 mmHg for the elderly with scant data in those over age 80. However, it was decided to set the goal to less than 140/90 mmHg unless the patient cannot tolerate it and then try for 140-145 mmHg. The data are scant at best for those over age 80 mmHg but some evidence exists for <150/80 mmHg. Diuretics and calcium antagonists are the most efficacious single agents for treatment; however, most patients will require two or more drugs to achieve such goals.",

Currently, there is evidence that some general practitioners in Australia are not prescribing appropriately for patients diagnosed with 1) hypertension (HT) and 2) chronic heart failure (CHF). The objectives of this study were to improve general practitioner's drug treatment management of these patients through feedback on their own prescribing and small group discussions with peers and a trained group facilitator. The impact evaluation includes quantitative assessment of prescribing changes at 6, 9, 12 and 18 months after the intervention.",

General practices were recruited nationally through General Practice Networks across Australia. Participating practices were randomly allocated to one of three groups: two groups received the QI intervention (the prescribing indicator feedback reports and small group discussion) with each group undertaking the clinical topics (CHF and HT) in reverse order to the other. The third group was waitlisted to receive the intervention 6 months later and acted as a \"control\" for the other two groups.De-identified data on practice, doctor and patient characteristics and their treatment for CHF and HT are extracted at six-monthly intervals before and after the intervention.

Male, 16-week-old hypertensive rats were allocated to 3 groups: (i) animals treated daily for 4 weeks with captopril (CAP, 80 mg\u00b7(kg body mass)(-1), n = 45), (ii) animals treated with CAP\u2009+\u2009nifedipine (NIF, 10 mg\u00b7kg(-1), n = 45), or (iii) untreated hypertensive controls (n = 96). Wistar rats (n = 96) were used as normotensive controls. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), heart rate (HR), and heart mass / body mass (HW/BW) ratio were measured at the beginning and end of the experiments; measurements for mitochondrial Mg(2+)-ATPase activity, O(2)-consumption (QO(2)), respiratory control index (RCI), ADP/O, oxidative phosphorylation rate (OPR), conjugated diene content (CD), and membrane fluidity (MF) were also taken at different time intervals. In the heart, elevated SBP, HR, and HW/BW accompanied increased QO(2), OPR, and Mg(2+)-ATPase activity, indicating an adaptive response to hypertension-induced increase in the energy demands of the myocardium. Treatments with CAP or with CAP\u2009+\u2009NIF were very similar in their prevention of increase in SBP, HR, HW/BW, and the rise in OPR (all p < 0.05-0.01). In the kidneys, hypertension induced a drop in OPR; however, antihypertensive therapy aggravated the resulting energy deficiency, whereby treatment with CAP\u2009+\u2009NIF was more detrimental than treatment with CAP alone. Heart and kidney mitochondria exhibited negligible changes in CD and moderately increased MF, which was more potentiated by treatment with CAP alone than with CAP\u2009+\u2009NIF.",

    "23": "DEFINITION OF THE DISEASE: AL amyloidosis results from extra-cellular deposition of fibril-forming monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) light chains (LC) (most commonly of lambda isotype) usually secreted by a small plasma cell clone. Most patients have evidence of isolated monoclonal gammopathy or smoldering myeloma, and the occurrence of AL amyloidosis in patients with symptomatic multiple myeloma or other B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders is unusual. The key event in the development of AL amyloidosis is the change in the secondary or tertiary structure of an abnormal monoclonal LC, which results in instable conformation. This conformational change is responsible for abnormal folding of the LC, rich in \u03b2 leaves, which assemble into monomers that stack together to form amyloid fibrils.", 
    "24": "AL amyloidosis is the most common type of systemic amyloidois in developed countries with an estimated incidence of 9 cases/million inhabitant/year. The average age of diagnosed patients is 65 years and less than 10% of patients are under 50.",

The most common presenting symptoms are asthenia and dyspnoea, which are poorly specific and may account for delayed diagnosis. Renal manifestations are the most frequent, affecting two thirds of patients at presentation. They are characterized by heavy proteinuria, with nephrotic syndrome and impaired renal function in half of the patients. Heart involvement, which is present at diagnosis in more than 50% of patients, leading to restrictive cardiopathy, is the most serious complication and engages prognosis.", 
    "26": "The diagnosis relies on pathological examination of an involved site showing Congo red-positive amyloid deposits, with typical apple-green birefringence under polarized light, that stain positive with an anti-LC antibody by immunohistochemistry and/or immunofluorescence. Due to the systemic nature of the disease, non-invasive biopsies such as abdominal fat aspiration should be considered before taking biopsies from involved organs, in order to reduce the risk of bleeding complications.", 
    "27": "Systemic AL amyloidosis should be distinguished from other diseases related to deposition of monoclonal LC, and from other forms of systemic amyloidosis. When pathological studies have failed to identify the nature of amyloid deposits, genetic studies should be performed to diagnose hereditary amyloidosis.", 
    "28": "Treatment of AL amyloidosis is based on chemotherapy, aimed at controlling the underlying plasma clone that produces amyloidogenic LC. The hematological response should be carefully checked by serial measurements of serum free LC. The association of an alkylating agent with high-dose dexamethasone has proven to be effective in two thirds of patients and is considered as the current reference treatment. New agents used in the treatment of multiple myeloma are under investigation and appear to increase hematological response rates. Symptomatic measures and supportive care is necessary in patients with organ failure. Noticeably, usual treatments for cardiac failure (i.e. calcium inhibitors, \u03b2-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors) are inefficient or even dangerous in patients with amyloid heart disease, that should be managed using diuretics. Amiodarone and pace maker implantation should be considered in patients with rhythm or conduction abnormalities. In selected cases, heart and kidney transplantation may be associated with prolonged patient and graft survival.",

    "31": "The intercalation of a drug active, perindopril, into Mg/Al-layered double hydroxide for the formation of a new nanocomposite, PMAE, was accomplished using a simple ion exchange technique. A relatively high loading percentage of perindopril of about 36.5% (w/w) indicates that intercalation of the active took place in the Mg/Al inorganic interlayer. Intercalation was further supported by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and thermal analysis shows markedly enhanced thermal stability of the active. The release of perindopril from the nanocomposite occurred in a controlled manner governed by pseudo-second order kinetics. MTT assay showed no cytotoxicity effects from either Mg/Al-layered double hydroxide or its nanocomposite, PMAE. Mg/Al-layered double hydroxide showed angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitory activity, with 5.6% inhibition after 90 minutes of incubation. On incubation of angiotensin-converting enzyme with 0.5 \u03bcg/mL of the PMAE nanocomposite, inhibition of the enzyme increased from 56.6% to 70.6% at 30 and 90 minutes, respectively.

Progressive loss of the filtration barrier allows excessive proteinuria, which ultimately leads to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). The evidence for a beneficial renoprotective effect of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockade by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and/or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) is well established in AS and recent evidence has shown that it can significantly delay the time to onset of renal replacement therapy and ESKD.

    "44": "To optimize strategies for liver-directed cell therapy, prevention of initial transplanted cell losses is particularly important for subsequent liver repopulation. After cell transplantation in hepatic sinusoids, perturbations in hepatic microcirculation along with changes in various liver cell types are among the earliest changes. Therefore, for advancing further concepts in cell engraftment we studied vascular and related events in the liver after transplanting syngeneic hepatocytes into dipeptidyl peptidase IV-deficient rats. We treated rats with vascular drugs to define whether deleterious cell transplantation-induced events could be controlled followed by improvements in transplanted cell engraftment and proliferation. We found cell transplantation altered liver gene expression related to vessel tone, inflammation, cell adhesion, thrombosis, or tissue damage/remodeling. This was due to hepatic ischemia, endothelial injury, and activation of neutrophils, Kupffer cells, and hepatic stellate cells. Treatment of rats before cell transplantation with the angiotensin converting enzyme blocker, lisinopril, or angiotensin II receptor blocker, losartan, did not improve cell engraftment. By contrast, direct-acting nitroglycerine or prostacyclin improved cell engraftment and also kinetics of liver repopulation. These drugs lowered hepatic ischemia and inflammation, whereas pretreatment of rats with the dual endothelin-1 receptor blocker, bosentan, improved cell engraftment independently of hepatic ischemia or inflammation, without improving liver repopulation. However, incubation of hepatocytes with bosentan protected cells from cytokine toxicity in vitro and produced superior cell engraftment and proliferation in vivo.",

However, with the passage of time, a progressive effort has been made to expand the evidence base for treatment in older adults. 2008 saw publication of data from the Hypertension in the Very Elderly Trial which demonstrated significant mortality and morbidity benefits from antihypertensive therapy in octogenarians. More recently, additional data from this cohort has been published suggesting that appropriate anti-hypertensive therapy may lead to a reduction in incident cognitive impairment and fractures, whilst a 1 year open label extension of the main study confirmed many of the original trial findings. This review provides an overview of the Hypertension in the Very Elderly Trial whilst also discursively evaluating the latest data.", 
    "51": "The aim of the study was to estimate the efficacy of lysinopril (and/or its combination with hydrochlorothiazide) in terms of alteration of the diurnal AP profile and heart rhythm in patients with essential hypertension (EH). The study included 47 patients (18 men. 29 women) with grade 1-3 EN (I-II stages). They were given lysinopril at a single dose of 3-5 mg/day after the initial non-treatment period of 1-2 weeks. The dose was increased up to 20 mg in the absence of effect within the first 3-5 days and supplemented with 12.5 hydrochlorothiazide if the response was still absent after 4 weeks. The follow up period was 4 and 12 weeks. Lysinopril was shown to effectively reduce AP in 72.3% of the patients within 4 weeks and in 87.2% if given in combination with hydrochlorothiazide for 12 weeks. It is concluded that long-term monotherapy or combined therapy with lysinopril stabilizes the disturbed diurnal AP profile, decreases variability and morning rises of AP, normalizes vegetative regulation of heart rhythms, and promotes regression of myocardial hypertrophy.",

Nevertheless, the effects of early treatment by VPI on cardiac remodelling have not been well assessed. We analysed the effects of early chronic VPI (50\u00a0mg/kg/day Omapatrilat) on cardiac remodelling and neurohumoral function during the progression of rapid ventricular pacing-induced heart failure in rabbits (early left ventricular dysfunction [ELVD]: 10\u00a0days at 330\u00a0bpm, CHF: further 10\u00a0days at 360\u00a0bpm). VPI-treated animals (ELVD-VPI n\u2009=\u20096; CHF-VPI n\u2009=\u20098) and placebo treated animals (ELVD n\u2009=\u20096; CHF n\u2009=\u20097) were compared with control rabbits (CTRL n\u2009=\u20095). LV fractional shortening (FS) and enddiastolic diameter (LVEDD) were assessed by echocardiography (12\u00a0MHz probe). LV BNP- and LV IL-6 gene expression was analysed quantitatively by real time PCR. Neurohumoral function was assessed by ANP, cGMP, plasma renin activity (PRA) and Aldosterone. In ELVD, LVEDD and atrial mass were significantly increased (both p\u2009<\u20090.05). This increase was markedly attenuated by VPI (both p\u2009<\u20090.05 vs. placebo). CHF was associated with a further increase in atrial mass and an increase in LV mass (both p\u2009<\u20090.05), which was again attenuated by VPI (atrial mass, p\u2009<\u20090.05 vs. untreated). LV BNP mRNA was significantly increased in CHF (p\u2009<\u20090.05 vs. control), and chronic VPI completely abolished this increase in ELVD and significantly attenuated it in CHF (p\u2009<\u20090.05 vs. CHF-placebo). Beyond that, the increase of cGMP was augmented by chronic VPI (p\u2009<\u20090.05 vs. placebo in CHF) in heart failure and that of Aldosterone was attenuated (p\u2009<\u20090.05 vs. placebo in ELVD), whereas PRA was temporarily increased (p\u2009<\u20090.05 vs. placebo in ELVD). Combined inhibition of ACE and NEP by VPI significantly inhibits early cardiac remodelling and LV BNP gene expression. If initiated early enough, it may slow down cardiac remodelling and represents a promising therapeutic strategy in progressive heart failure.", 
    "58": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers can improve insulin resistance and vascular dysfunction in insulin-resistant rats; however, there are few reports on the effects of direct renin inhibitors on these conditions. We investigated the effects of a direct renin inhibitor, aliskiren, on insulin resistance, aortic endothelial dysfunction and vascular remodeling in fructose-fed hypertensive rats. Male Wistar-Kyoto rats were divided into four groups (n=6 per group) and studied for 8 weeks: Group Con: standard chow diet; group Fru: high-fructose diet (60% fructose); Group FruA: high-fructose diet with concurrent aliskiren treatment (100\u2009mg\u2009kg(-1) per day); and Group FruB: high-fructose diet with subsequent aliskiren treatment 4 weeks later. Blood was collected for biochemical assays, and isolated rings of the thoracic aorta were obtained for analysis of vascular reactivity, vascular structure and lipid peroxide. Rats fed with high-fructose diets developed significant systolic hypertension, decreased plasma nitrite (NO(2); nitric oxide metabolite) levels and increased plasma glucose, insulin, triglyceride, total cholesterol and aortic lipid peroxide levels, and aortic wall thickness compared with control rats. Aliskiren treatment, either concurrent or subsequent, elevated plasma NO(2) levels and reduced systolic hypertension, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, aortic lipid peroxide levels and aortic wall hypertrophy in FHR. The peak endothelium-dependent aortic relaxations were significantly higher in rats that received aliskiren treatment than in those that did not. In conclusion, our findings suggest that aliskiren prevents and ameliorates insulin resistance, aortic endothelial dysfunction and oxidative vascular remodeling in fructose-fed hypertensive rats.", 
    "59": "Hypertension guidelines recommend blood pressure self-measurement at home (HBP), but no previous trial has assessed cardiovascular outcomes in hypertensive patients treated according to HBP. The multicenter Hypertension Objective Treatment Based on Measurement by Electrical Devices of Blood Pressure (HOMED-BP; 2001-2010) trial involved 3518 patients (50% women; mean age 59.6 years) with an untreated systolic/diastolic HBP of 135-179/85-119 mm Hg. In a 2 \u00d7 3 design, patients were randomized to usual control (125-134/80-84 mm Hg (UC)) vs. tight control (<125/<80 mm Hg (TC)) of HBP and to initiation of drug treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers or calcium channel blockers. During follow-up, a computer algorithm automatically generated treatment recommendations based on HBP. At the last follow-up (median 5.3 years), TC patients used more antihypertensive drugs than UC patients (1.82 vs. 1.74 defined daily doses, P=0.045) and had a greater HBP reduction (21.3/13.1 mm Hg vs. 22.7/13.9 mm Hg, P=0.018/0.020), but they less frequently achieved the lower HBP targets (37.4 vs. 63.5%, P<0.0001). The primary end point, cardiovascular death plus stroke and myocardial infarction, occurred in 25 UC and 26 TC patients (hazard ratio, 1.02; 95% confidence interval, 0.59-1.77; P=0.94). Rates were similar (P\u22650.13) in the three drug groups. In all patients combined, the risk of the primary end point independently increased by 41% (6-89%; P=0.019) and 47% (15-87%; P=0.0020) for a 1-s.d. increase in baseline (12.5 mm Hg) and follow-up (13.2 mm Hg) systolic HBP. The 5-year risk was minimal (\u22641%) if on-treatment systolic HBP was 131.6 mm Hg or less. HOMED-BP proved the feasibility of adjusting antihypertensive drug treatment based on HBP and suggests that a systolic HBP level of 130 mm Hg should be an achievable and safe target.", 
    "60": "Chronic renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) activation has far-reaching effects on cardiometabolic risk and is a substantial contributor to cardiovascular (CV) disease and renal dysfunction. The vascular effects of sustained RAAS activation are associated with hemodynamic imbalances, as well as inflammatory stimulation and prothrombotic processes that lead to fibrosis, endothelial dysfunction and cellular remodeling. RAAS inhibition therapies, which include the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers and more recently, direct renin inhibitors, have been used in clinical practice for more than 30 years. Our understanding of how these drugs work, alone and in combination, has contributed to an expanding landscape of treatment options and established RAAS inhibition as essential for reducing the risk of CV and renal disease. This perspective provides a historical overview of how RAAS inhibitors have evolved to their present-day status and will discuss recently discovered functions for components of this complicated and powerful regulatory system.",

They have a known adverse effect of unresponsiveness to vasoconstrictors resulting in hypotension for the patients undergoing cardiac surgery. We report a case of a 43-year-old female patient with preoperative lisinopril (2.5 mg per day for a week prior to cardiac surgery), who was diagnosed with severe mitral and tricuspid valve regurgitation. She underwent both a mitral and tricuspid valve replacement operation using cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). To address her ACEI-associated hypotension on cardiopulmonary bypass, bypass flows were as high as cardiac index of greater than 3 (3.1 +/- .2) L/min/m2 to provide sufficient perfusion indicated by cerebral oxymetry monitoring and adequate urine on pump. In addition, due to unresponsiveness to regular concentration of neosynephrine (neo), boluses of higher concentrations up to 320 microg/mL of neo were administered to maintain the perfusion pressure on pump. The patient was weaned from CPB uneventfully and was discharged home on postoperative day 7. Additional therapeutic treatment to ACEI-associated hypotension and unresponsiveness to neo for the patients undergoing cardiac surgery using CPB is reviewed as well in this paper.",

Our examinations therefore targeted on the effects of the aldosterone synthase inhibitor fadrozole and the MR antagonist spironolactone compared to vehicle in an established rat model of CAI. In our model of CAI, neither the aldosterone biosynthesis inhibitor nor a direct MR blockade had a positive effect on renal CAI in rats. Fadrozole- and spironolactone-treated animals demonstrated a higher proteinuria value, pathologically elevated potassium values, higher tubulointerstitial damage and markedly increased heart weight/body weight as compared to vehicle. Our observations also suggest that inhibition of the MR or the biosynthesis itself had a bad influence on the amount of sclerotic glomeruli and tubulointerstitial damage.

Cardiac and renal dysfunction may worsen each other through multiple mechanisms such as fluid overload and increased venous pressure, hypo-perfusion, neurohormonal and inflammatory activation, and concomitant treatment. The interaction between cardiac and renal dysfunction may be critical for disease progression and prognosis. Renal dysfunction is conventionally defined by a reduced glomerular filtration rate, calculated from serum creatinine levels. This definition has limitations as serum creatinine is dependent on age, gender, muscle mass, volume status, and renal haemodynamics. Changes in serum creatinine related to treatment with diuretics or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are not necessarily associated with worse outcomes. New biomarkers might be of additional value to detect an early deterioration in renal function and to improve the prognostic assessment, but they need further validation. Thus, the evaluation of renal function in patients with heart failure is important as it may reflect their haemodynamic status and provide a better prognostic assessment.

Multivariable Cox-regression models showed that higher baseline ACE levels were associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke and CHD; HR's (95%CI) were 1.7 (1.0-2.7) and 1.8 (1.2-2.9). High ACE particularly increased risk of stroke in patients with high blood pressure (defined as >140/90 mmHg) (HR = 4.8; 95%CI 1.0-19.4). This relation was independent of several confounders including use of antihypertensive medication. Serum ACE was not significantly associated with risk of vascular death.",

    "100": "Noncompaction cardiomyopathy (NCC) is a primary cardiomyopathy characterized by an excessively prominent trabecular meshwork and deep intertrabecular recesses of the left ventricular walls. Most cases are inherited, with a dominant inheritance pattern. The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence and clinical characteristics of cardiomyopathies in the close relatives of patients with NCC. We evaluated 156, mostly first-degree, family members of 44 adult patients with NCC who agreed to familial screening. A family history of cardiac disease was reported by 16 (36%) of the 44 patients, including premature sudden death in 8 families (18%). NCC (n = 32) or dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 9) was diagnosed in 41 relatives (26%) by echocardiography (n = 25), contrast echocardiography (n = 6), or magnetic resonance imaging (n = 10). Of these family members, 13 already had known cardiac symptoms and signs, but most (28 of 41) were asymptomatic. Most subjects with NCC had mild to moderate left ventricular dysfunction (n = 29, 71%). After a median follow-up of 55 months (interquartile range 43 to 93), most remained asymptomatic. Four family members were treated with prophylactic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement and 23 of those with NCC were treated with drugs, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (41%), \u03b2 blockers (34%), and anticoagulants (17%). In conclusion, there is a high prevalence, mostly asymptomatic, of cardiac disease (26%) among first- and second-degree family members of patients with NCC. This warrants screening and offers an opportunity for early intervention.",

Compendial and in-house specifications were selected as QTPPs for ramipril tablets. CPPs that affected the product and process were used to establish an experimental design. The results thus obtained can be used to facilitate definition of the design space using tools such as design of experiments (DoE), the response surface method (RSM) and artificial neural networks (ANNs). The project was aimed at discovering hidden knowledge associated with the manufacture of ramipril tablets using a range of artificial intelligence-based software, with the intention of establishing a multi-dimensional design space that ensures consistent product quality. At the end of the study, a design space was developed based on the study data and specifications, and a new formulation was optimized.

The importance of angiotensin (ANG) in normal kidney development was first recognized in infants with renal maldevelopment born to mothers treated with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or with ANG AT1 receptor blockers. The molecular role of ANG in renal development has been elucidated using gene targeting in mice, revealing major effects in branching morphogenesis, vasculogenesis, development of the papilla and renal concentrating mechanism. Although exposure of the fetus to ANG inhibitors is potentially harmful throughout pregnancy, effects are greater in late compared to early gestation. Significant differences between humans and rodents in placental transfer of ANG and timing of renal development contributed to initial delays in recognizing the teratogenic effects of ANG inhibitors. Although administration of ACE or AT1 receptor inhibitors can slow progression of renal disease in older children, ANG inhibition in the neonatal period can aggravate renal injury due to congenital urinary tract obstruction. Neonates are also far more sensitive than older children to the hypotensive actions these agents and doses must be markedly reduced to avoid precipitating oliguria. Understanding the complex interactions of the maturing renin-angiotensin system in the perinatal period is essential in the use of ANG or renin inhibitors in women during childbearing years or in neonates with cardiovascular or renal disease.",

With the use of a comparator with incident CAD alone (n=154 183), we assessed temporal trends and comparative use of cardioprotective medications. Relative differences in medication use were examined by using multivariable logistic regression. Use of medications improved temporally among both groups: for PAD alone, any antiplatelet use increased from 29% to 59% from 2000 to 2007 (P<0.0001), whereas statin use increased 6-fold (9%-56%; P<0.0001). However, use of these therapies by 18 months after incident diagnosis for both PAD groups remained modest and lower in comparison with CAD alone (any antiplatelet, 53% versus 66%; statins, 40% versus 52%; angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, 20% versus 29%).

However, the molecular mechanisms by which anthocyanins (delphinidin and cyanin) and quercetin regulate the renin-angiotensin system are not completely understood. In this study, we demonstrate that delphinidin, cyanin, and quercetin interrupt the renin-angiotensin system signaling pathway by inhibiting the angiotensin-converting enzyme activity and decreasing its mRNA production. Furthermore, treatment with either delphinidin or cyanin significantly inhibited renin mRNA production. However, delphinidin, cyanin, and quercetin did not act as the angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist and did not play roles in the regulation of its internalization.

A higher cumulative anthracycline dose and a younger age of diagnosis are only a few of the many risk factors that identify the children at increased risk of developing cardiotoxicity. While cardiotoxicity can develop at anytime, starting from treatment initiation and well into adulthood, identifying the best cardioprotective measures to minimize the long-term damage caused by anthracyclines in children is imperative. Dexrazoxane is the only known agent to date, that is associated with less cardiac dysfunction, without reducing the oncologic efficacy of the anthracycline doxorubicin in children.

    "147": "Effective treatment of high blood pressure represents a key strategy for reducing the burden of hypertension-related cardiovascular diseases, mostly myocardial infarction and stroke. Despite these well established concepts, however, hypertension remains poorly controlled, worldwide. In addition, treated hypertensive patients often remain at higher risk compared with the normotensive population, even when a satisfactory blood pressure control is achieved, due to the high or very high added cardiovascular risk profile observed in these patients. An emerging strategy to improve blood pressure control and achieve this unmet target for cardiovascular disease prevention in hypertensive patients is represented by a more extensive use of rational and effective combination therapies with respect to monotherapy. Such an approach has been recently proposed even as first-line strategy in hypertensive patients at high added cardiovascular risk or in those in whom strict blood pressure control is required. Within the possible antihypertensive drug combinations currently available for the clinical management of hypertension, those based on the association of drugs inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system and thiazide diuretics or calcium channel blockers have demonstrated to be effective and safe in lowering both systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels with a good tolerability profile. In addition, these strategies have provided evidence for effective cardiovascular protection compared with conventional antihypertensive therapies. Among the antihypertensive drugs able to counteract the deleterious effects of abnormal activation of the renin-angiotensin system, angiotensin II receptor blockers have demonstrated to provide better tolerability profile and greater cardiovascular protection on hypertension-related organ damage compared with ACE inhibitors in randomized controlled clinical trials, in the presence of similar antihypertensive efficacy and safety. In particular, these drugs are characterized by lower rates of drug-related side effects, better compliance and adherence to prescribed antihypertensive regimens, and use in synergistic and rational combination therapies, all factors that may contribute to improve blood pressure control and reduce discontinuations from antihypertensive therapy in treated hypertensive patients.", 
    "148": "The goal of antihypertensive therapy is to reduce the risk associated with blood pressure elevation. Although the choice of first-line drug therapy may exert some effects on different long-term cardiovascular endpoints, randomized clinical trials and meta-analyses demonstrated that blood pressure reduction per se is the primary determinant in primary and secondary prevention. Numerous analyses carried out over the last years have repeatedly shown that many patients require the combination of two or more drugs to reach the recommended level of blood pressure control. Within this context, combination therapy with separate agents or fixed-dose combination pills offers an attractive ability to lower blood pressure more quickly, decrease adverse effects and reach blood pressure target. It is not clear whether fixed combinations of antihypertensive agents in a single tablet provide a greater benefit than the corresponding components given separately. In other words, it is not clear if the use of fixed combinations translates into a clearly improved blood pressure control and cardiovascular prevention in clinical practice. Fixed-dose combinations may simplify the treatment regimen by reducing the number of pills and may be attractive for many hypertensive patients. However, single-pill (fixed) drug combinations have some disadvantages: (i) branded fixed combinations may be more expensive than equivalent free combinations; (ii) the duration of action of individual components may not be equivalent, and this may not justify a single daily dosing of the combination; and (iii) the use of fixed combinations implies less flexibility in modifying the doses of individual components and the exposure of patients to unnecessary therapy. Moreover, should a patient develop side effects to one component, the entire combination should be discontinued and replaced by free drugs. The following three types of fixed-dose tablets have been recently proposed to give additional flexibility: (i) tablet manufactured so that each of the two drugs is placed at opposite ends of the tablet with a drug-free (inactive) layer placed in between; (ii) tablet with the combination of drugs at each end with the inactive zone in between; and (iii) tablet divided into discrete, separate segments (the two drugs are combined uniformly), which provides benefits for initial close titration and dosage adjustments. Currently, none of the fixed-dose tablets available on the market have these characteristics and, consequently, are unable to be broken to allow sufficient flexibility.",

A left MCA (M1) Wingspan stent-assisted angioplasty was performed after standard loading, and daily doses of clopidogrel were given 3 days prior to the procedure. Immediately after the procedure, the patient developed a left hemispheric ischemic stroke syndrome. Urgent re-angiography identified an acute intracranial in-stent thrombosis. This complication was immediately treated successfully with abciximab and balloon angioplasty. The patient had persistent residual stroke despite complete recanalization of the thrombosed stent within 3 h of occlusion. The patient was subsequently found to have incomplete inhibition of platelet activity despite being on clopidogrel 150 mg and aspirin 81 mg daily and having a normal CYP-2C19 genotype, suggesting that suboptimal antiplatelet inhibition, secondary to morbid obesity, contributed to his in-stent thrombosis. Obese patients undergoing coronary artery stenting routinely receive larger loading and maintenance doses of clopidogrel.

To further elucidate the mechanism of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) action in mediating sodium intake behavior and accompanied salty taste changes, the present study examined the salty taste function changes accompanied with sodium depletion induced by furosemide (Furo) combined with different doses of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, captopril (Cap). Both the peripheral and central RAAS activity and the nuclei Fos immunoreactivity (Fos-ir) expression in the forebrain area were investigated. Results showed that sodium depletion induced by Furo+low-Cap increased taste preference for hypertonic NaCl solution with amplified brain action of ANG II but without peripheral action, while Furosemide combined with a high dose of captopril can partially inhibit the formation of brain ANG II, with parallel decreased effects on salty taste changes. And the resulting elevating forebrain ANG II may activate a variety of brain areas including SFO, PVN, SON and OVLT in sodium depleted rats injected with Furo+low-Cap, which underlines salty taste function and sodium intake behavioral changes. Neurons in SFO and OVLT may be activated mainly by brain ANG II, while PVN and SON activation may not be completely ANG II dependent. These findings suggested that forebrain derived ANG II may play a critical role in the salty taste function changes accompanied with acute sodium depletion.",

Angiotensin II (Ang II), as a key peptide of RAS, contributes to the contraction of human airway smooth muscle by activating the RhoA/Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase 2 (ROCK2) signaling pathway. Angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)], is a component of the angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-Ang-(1-7)-Mas axis which counteracts the detrimental effects of the ACE- Ang II-angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) axis in vivo; however, whether Ang-(1-7) can inhibit the effect of Ang II in the contraction of human airway smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) is unknown. In our study, collagen gel lattices and immunofluorescence were used to evaluate the contraction of HASMCs induced by Ang II. Real-time PCR and western blot analysis were performed to confirm the regulatory mechanism and the participating signaling pathway. Ang II caused the contraction of HASMCs; this effect was reversed by Ang\u2011(1\u20117). In addition, irbesartan and A779, which are inhibitors of AT1R and Mas, respectively, attenuated the effect of Ang II and Ang-(1-7). Furthermore, Y-27632, an inhibitor of ROCK2, attenuated the Ang II-induced contraction of HASMCs by blocking the RhoA/ROCK2 signaling pathway which is involved in this contraction, and thus may be a major regulator involved in the basal maintenance of contractility in HASMCs. These data demonstrate that Ang II induces the contraction of HASMCs and that this effect can be reversed by Ang-(1-7), partially through the downregulation of of the RhoA/ROCK2 signaling pathway.",

While hypertension increases the risk of coronary artery disease in inflammatory bowel disease patients, other typical risk factors have not been confirmed, and markers of inflammation may predict coronary artery disease risk in this population. Common cardiovascular drugs such as statins and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may have dual potential for controlling inflammatory bowel disease and preventing or treating coronary artery disease. Large, prospective, longitudinal studies can help to determine the true prevalence of coronary artery disease in this population and confirm risk factors. In the absence of such evidence, physicians should be cognizant of increased coronary artery disease risk in inflammatory bowel disease patients without traditional risk factors and consider primary preventive strategies.",

Bivariate analyses showed higher prescription of thiazolidinediones and oral combination drugs as well as of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium channel blockers and aspirin in men than in women. After full adjustment, differences between men and women remained significant only for ACE inhibitors (OR=1.44; 95%-confidence interval (CI): 1.11-1.88) and calcium channel blockers (OR=1.42, 95%-CI: 1.05-1.91).",

As this might be a promising modality for extension of the viability of human lung grafts for transplantation we tested the hypothesis whether anti-ACE antibodies are suitable for human lung protection within the model of isolated perfused and ventilated human lung resections. Right after surgery for lung cancer, human lung specimens were isolated, ventilated and perfused under physiological conditions with 500 \u03bcg of either mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to human ACE (9B9, I2H5, 3G8) or non-immune mouse IgG (as a negative control) followed by wash-out perfusion. Perfusion pressure, pH and lung weight gain were measured before and during perfusion. After mAb perfusion and wash-out perfusion period lung tissue was tested for the uptake of mAbs by immunohistochemistry and by enzyme-capture technique. Furthermore, antibody concentration and ACE shedding were measured within the perfusate. We found that ACE activity in tumor and normal lung tissue did not differ between the groups perfused with different mAbs. However, ACE activity in normal lung tissue (17.0 \u00b1 6.0 U/g) was significantly higher compared to tumor tissue (6.0 \u00b1 3.0; p < 0.01). Absolute retaining of mAbs was with 1.3 \u00b1 1.1% of injected dose per gram of tissue in normal lung tissue, 0.7 \u00b1 0.7% of injected dose per gram of tumor tissue and was significantly higher compared to non-immune mouse IgG (0.1 \u00b1 0.1%/g; p < 0.01). Anti-ACE mAbs concentration in the perfusate dropped significantly to 47 \u00b1 11% (p < 0.001) at 40 min of perfusion. No significant difference between different anti-ACE mAbs in the depletion from perfusate has been observed. mAb 9B9 showed the most intense immunostaining (i.e., most significant lung uptake) after each experiment in normal and tumor lung tissue compared to mAbs i2H5 and 3G8 (p < 0.01). These results validate the possibility of immunotargeting of pulmonary endothelium in the human lung tissue by anti-ACE mAbs under in vivo conditions.

To uncover the molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon, we have investigated the tripeptide/ACE complexes through molecular dynamics simulations coupled with quantum mechanical simulations. Comparative structural analysis has identified a hydrophobic subsite in the active site of cACE comprising hydrophobic residues Val379, Val380, Phe457, Phe527, and Ala418. The interactions of the side chains of Leu and Ile with the hydrophobic residues determine the binding positions of N-terminal residues of the tripeptides, that influence the interaction of the residues of tripeptides with the active site of cACE.

Differences in male and female patients enrolled in ONTARGET/TRANSCEND were analyzed for the primary 4-fold end point (composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or admission to hospital for heart failure), a secondary 3-fold end point (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke), and individual components of the primary composite. Baseline characteristics included age, ethnicity, body mass index, physical activity, tobacco use, alcohol consumption, formal education, clinical diagnosis for study entry, patient history, and concomitant medication. Patients were followed up until death or the end of the study (median, 56 months). Compared with male patients, female patients had a 19% significantly lower risk for the 4-fold end point and 21% for the 3-fold end point (after adjustment for study, treatment, and the above baseline values). Similarly, the adjusted risk for cardiovascular death (17%) and myocardial infarction (22%), but not for stroke and hospitalization for heart failure, was also significantly lower in women.

Endothelium-derived nitric oxide-type responses did not differ in both strains and were not influenced by SOL1 treatment.

In this paper, we discuss optimal design of MAMS trials. An optimal design has the required type I error rate and power but minimises the expected sample size at some set of treatment effects. Finding an optimal design requires searching over stopping boundaries and sample size, potentially a large number of parameters. We propose a method that combines quick evaluation of specific designs and an efficient stochastic search to find the optimal design parameters. We compare various potential designs motivated by the design of a phase II MAMS trial. We also consider allocating more patients to the control group, as has been carried out in real MAMS studies.

In addition to direct toxic effects, kidney inflammatory events take place during the HgCl\u2082-induced nephropathy.

Accordingly, the aim of this study was to determine the expression of Ang II and Ang II-associated inflammatory molecules, i.e. intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and mono-cyte/macrophage infiltration (ED-1), in HgCl\u2082-induced nephropathy. Three groups of Sprague Dawley rats that were to receive HgCl\u2082 (2.5\u2009mg HgCl\u2082/kg BW, by gavage) were utilized: one had received Losartan at 30\u2009mg/kg BW; one had received Enalapril at 30\u2009mg/kg BW; and one had received distilled water, in each case daily for 3 days prior to the HgCl\u2082 exposure.

Renal biopsies were obtained 96\u2009h after HgCl\u2082 injection and the expressions of Ang II, ICAM-1, iNOS, and ED-1 were analyzed by indirect immunoflourescence while tubular damage was assessed via histopathology. An increased expression of Ang II, ICAM-1, iNOS, and ED-1 as well as increases in tubular necrosis were observed in all HgCl\u2082-animals. Treatments with Losartan or Enalapril diminished the induced expressions as well as the extent of tubular damage.

We analyzed the expression profile of miRNA in microdissected glomeruli and found that miR-324-3p was the most upregulated. In situ hybridization localized miR-324-3p to glomerular podocytes, parietal cells of Bowman's capsule, and most abundantly, cortical tubules. A predicted target of miR-324-3p is prolyl endopeptidase (Prep), a serine peptidase involved in the metabolism of angiotensins and the synthesis of the antifibrotic peptide N-acetyl-seryl-aspartyl-lysyl-proline (Ac-SDKP). In cultured tubular cells, transient transfection with a miR-324-3p mimic reduced Prep protein and activity, validating Prep as a target of this miRNA. In MWF rats, upregulation of miR-324-3p associated with markedly reduced expression of Prep in both glomeruli and tubules, low urine Ac-SDKP, and increased deposition of collagen. ACE inhibition downregulated glomerular and tubular miR-324-3p, promoted renal Prep expression, increased plasma and urine Ac-SDKP, and attenuated renal fibrosis. In summary, these results suggest that dysregulation of the miR-324-3p/Prep pathway contributes to the development of fibrosis in progressive nephropathy. The renoprotective effects of ACE inhibitors may result, in part, from modulation of this pathway, suggesting that it may hold other potential therapeutic targets.",

Of 233 patients, the mean age was 63 years, 28 patients (12%) were treated with warfarin, and 205 patients (88%) were not on warfarin. Based on their total CACS, the patients were subsequently stratified into 59 with no coronary calcium (CACS = 0), 63 with low CACS (1-100), 49 with moderate CACS (101-400), 33 with severe CACS (410-1000), and 29 with very severe CACS (>1000). The \u03c7 test and Student t-test were used for the comparison of categorical and continuous variables, respectively, between warfarin users and nonusers. Using the variables age, gender, race, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, glomerular filtration rate, calcium-phosphorus product, alkaline phosphatase, use of aspirin, beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, and statins, stepwise logistic regression analysis did not show any association of coronary calcification with use of warfarin. In our study, warfarin use was not associated with a higher prevalence or severity of CACS assessed by coronary computed tomography.",

The present study was designed to evaluate the effect of novel DADS analogs, against L-NAME induced hypertension in Wistar rats. The daily administration of L-NAME (50mg/kg) for six weeks along with DADS analogs (20 mg/kg) significantly decreased the elevated systolic blood pressure (SBP) and the activity of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and also inhibited the decline in nitrite/nitrate (NO(x)) concentrations and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) levels. Adverse changes such as lipid peroxidation, protein damage and a decrease in the levels of antioxidant enzymes, were rectified after the administration of DADS analogs. Oral administration of DADS analogs preserved the expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). The ability of the DADS analogs to inhibit L-NAME induced hypertension was compared with Enalapril (15 mg/kg), which was taken as a standard. The DADS analogs prevented L-NAME-induced cardio toxicity, which was also reflected at the microscopic level indicative of its cardio protective effects. DADS analogs induced vasorelaxation was completely abolished by the removal of the endothelium or by pre-treatment with L-NAME, an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase. DADS analogs inhibited the calcium influx induced by phenylephrine (0.3 \u03bcM) and high K(+) (60mM) and this effect was completely abolished by pretreatment of L-NAME. Taken together, our results show that the DADS analogs induce vasorelaxation and have antihypertensive properties, which may be mediated through activation of eNOS.", 
    "281": "In this work, a simple, versatile and fully automated analytical methodology for the chemiluminometric determination of captopril - an angiotensin II-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor - in pharmaceutical formulations, is proposed. The developed methodology was based on the enhancement by captopril of the chemiluminescence emission of tris(2,2'-bipyridyl)ruthenium(II). In sulphuric acid medium tris(2,2'-bipyridyl)ruthenium(II) was oxidized by cerium(IV) and converted into a reactive oxidant specie [Ru(bpy)(3)](3+), which was subsequently reduced with captopril in order to yield a significant enhancement of the original chemiluminescence emission that was directly related to captopril concentration. The analytical process was implemented by resorting to an automated multi-pumping flow system (MPFS) that enabled the establishment of multiple reaction interfaces, which, in combination with the created pulsed flowing stream assured a fast and reproducible sample/reagent mixing and reaction development essential to guarantee the generation and subsequent measurement of the short-lived species involved in the chemiluminescent process. The developed system employed three solenoid micro-pumps as the only flow manifold active components. These assured the insertion, propelling and commuting of all solutions. The automatic actuation of the solenoid micro-pumps provided an easily programmed, operated and controlled analytical flow system, exhibiting high versatility, efficiency and compactness at a low cost. Under the optimized experimental conditions, the proposed method allowed the determination of captopril for concentrations between 2\u00d710(-3) and 1.5\u00d710(-1)mmolL(-1) (r=0.9996, n=6) and a sampling frequency of about 58 determinations per hour, producing 620\u03bcL of waste per determination.

The EARLY PRO-TECT Alport trial assesses the safety and efficacy of early therapy onset with ramipril in pediatric Alport patients. Methods and analysis. This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter phase III trial (NCT01485978; EudraCT-number 2010-024300-10) includes 120 pediatric patients aged 24 months to 18 years with early stages of Alport syndrome (isolated hematuria or microalbuminuria). From March 2012, up to 80 patients will be randomized 1:1 to ramipril or placebo. In the event of disease progression during 3-year treatment, patients are unblinded and ramipril is initiated, if applicable. Approximately 40 patients receive open-label ramipril contributing to the safety database. Primary end-points are \"time to progression to next disease level\" and \"incidence of adverse drug events before disease progression.\" Treatment effect estimates from the randomized comparison and Alport registry data will be combined in supportive analyses to maximize evidence. Conclusion. Without this trial, ACE inhibitors may become standard off-label treatment in Alport syndrome without satisfactory evidence base.

    "294": "The intrarenal renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has several pathophysiologic functions not only in blood pressure regulation but also in the development of glomerulonephritis (GN). Angiotensin II (Ang II) is the biologically active product of the RAS. Locally produced Ang II induces inflammation, renal cell growth, mitogenesis, apoptosis, migration, and differentiation, regulates the gene expression of bioactive substances, and activates multiple intracellular signaling pathways, leading to tissue damage. Activation of the Ang II type 1 (AT1) receptor pathway results in the production of proinflammatory mediators, cell proliferation, and extracellular matrix synthesis, which facilitates glomerular injury. Previous studies have shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and/or AT1 receptor blockers have beneficial effects in experimental GN models and humans with various types of GN, and that these effects are more significant than their suppressive effects on blood pressure. In this paper, we focus on intrarenal RAS activation in the pathophysiology of experimental models of GN.", 
    "295": "The inhibitory effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-ANG II-angiotensin type 1 (AT\u2081) receptor axis on jejunal glucose uptake and the reduced expression of this system in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) have been documented previously. The ACE2-ANG-(1-7)-Mas receptor axis is thought to oppose the actions of the ACE-ANG II-AT\u2081 receptor axis in heart, liver, and kidney. However, the possible involvement of the ACE2-ANG-(1-7)-Mas receptor system on enhanced jejunal glucose transport in T1DM has yet to be determined. Rat everted jejunum and Caco-2 cells were used to determine the effects of ANG-(1-7) on glucose uptake and to study the ACE2-ANG-(1-7)-Mas receptor signaling pathway. Expression of target gene and protein in jejunal enterocytes and human Caco-2 cells were quantified using real-time PCR and Western blotting. T1DM increased jejunal protein and mRNA expression of ACE2 (by 59 and 173%, respectively) and Mas receptor (by 55 and 100%, respectively) in jejunum. One millimolar ANG-(1-7) reduced glucose uptake in jejunum and Caco-2 cells by 30.6 and 30.3%, respectively, effects that were abolished following addition of 1 \u03bcM A-779 (a Mas receptor blocker) or 1 \u03bcM GF-109203X (protein kinase C inhibitor) to incubation buffer for jejunum or Caco-2 cells, respectively. Finally, intravenous treatment of animals with ANG-(1-7) significantly improved oral glucose tolerance in T1DM but not control animals. In conclusion, enhanced activity of the ACE2-ANG-(1-7)-Mas receptor axis in jejunal enterocytes is likely to moderate the T1DM-induced increase in jejunal glucose uptake resulting from downregulation of the ACE-ANG II-AT\u2081 receptor axis. Therefore, altered activity of both ACE and ACE2 systems during diabetes will determine the overall rate of glucose transport across the jejunal epithelium.",

Age, sun sensitivity, occupational sun exposure before the age of 30 years (but not afterward), lower educational level, history of eczema, the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, and more sunscreen use in the week, but not the 6 months, before enrollment were also independent predictors, but sunburns, baseline sun exposure, and other sun-protective measures, other skin cancers, and actinic keratoses were not. None of the eczema patients had a history of topical calcineurin use. The cumulative risk of BCC was 55% at 5 years.

Although these drugs were not found to be teratogenic in animals, until recently little was known about the teratogenic effects of ACEIs and ARBs in humans when exposure was limited to the first trimester of pregnancy. New evidence from epidemiologic studies indicates that there may be an elevated teratogenic risk when these drugs are taken during the first trimester of pregnancy. However, this elevated risk does not appear to be specific to ACEIs and ARBs, but is instead related to maternal factors and diseases that typically coexist with hypertension in pregnancy, such as diabetes, advanced maternal age, and obesity. Women who become pregnant while being treated with an ACEI or ARB should be advised to avoid exposure to these drugs during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy by switching to a different class of antihypertensive drugs between weeks 8 and 10 after conception.", 
    "317": "Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the most frequent cause of end-stage renal disease in western countries. This implies that current methods based of renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) targeting for preventing, slowing or promoting regression of DKD are insufficient. Podocyte injury and albuminuria are thought to be key events in DKD. Indeed several DKD stages are recognized based on the magnitude of albuminuria. However, the spectrum of DKD has recently expanded, as lack of significant albuminuria is present in 30% of diabetics with kidney function impairment. This may result from the widespread use of drugs targeting the RAAS. However, it may also indicate that additional pathogenic factors contribute to renal function deterioration despite control of albuminuria. In this regard, double blockade of the RAAS is more effective in reducing albuminuria that blockade of a single component. However, clinical trials assessing double blockade for renal function preservation have been disappointing and raised safety issues. Non-biased -omics approaches have uncovered alternative therapeutic targets, including the cytokine TRAIL, the MIF receptor CD74 and the proapoptotic intracellular protein BASP1. In addition, urinary proteomics has uncovered a peptidomic fingerprint for DKD progression that precedes the onset of microalbuminuria. Studies are underway to validate this fingerprint for early treatment of high risk patients. Recent clinical trials suggest a potential role of bardoxolone methyl to improve renal function in advanced DKD, while trials of avosentan, pirfenidone, sulodexide and pyridoxamine have been disappointing and further data are needed for paricalcitol and vitamin D, newer generation endothelin receptor antagonists and pentoxifylline.", 
    "318": "This study investigates the influence of salt intake on renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and clarifies their role to the target organ damage in the treated hypertensive patients. Subjects were 188 treated hypertensive outpatients (96 females and 92 males, mean age 67 \u00b1 11 y). Patients underwent 24-hour home urine collection to measure urinary salt excretion and proteinuria. Clinical blood pressure (BP) and blood chemistry including plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) were determined. Left ventricular mass index (LVMI) was also determined by echocardiography. Average BP was 129 \u00b1 16/68 \u00b1 10 mm Hg with the use of 2.0 antihypertensive drugs on average. Urinary salt excretion, PRA, and PAC were 8.1 \u00b1 3.2 g/day, 2.2 \u00b1 2.8 ng/mL/h, and 112 \u00b1 54 pg/mL, respectively. Even in the patients taking angiotensin receptor blocker or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (n = 146), 15.1% showed low PRA (<0.5 ng/mL/h) levels and salt excretion in these patients with low PRA (9.1 \u00b1 4.2 g/day) did not differ from those with higher PRA levels (8.2 \u00b1 2.6 g/day, NS). There was no correlation between salt excretion and PRA (r = 0.03, NS), while salt excretion showed a significant negative correlation to PAC (r = -0.17, P < .05). Urinary salt excretion was also correlated with proteinuria (r = 0.25, P < .01) and LVMI (r = 0.16, P < .05). In the multivariate analysis, salt excretion contributed to proteinuria (P < .05) or LVMI (P = .11) independent of age, sex, serum creatinine, and BP levels. Results indicate that PRA levels were relatively low and unaffected by salt intake in Japanese patients treated with antihypertensive drugs. Since high salt intake was possibly associated with target organ damages, strict salt reduction should be encouraged.",

Another 8 rats were chosen as the blank control group. Rats in the model group and the blank control group were administered with equal volume of normal saline by gastrogavage for 8 successive weeks. The blood glucose was monitored by the end of the 4th week and the 8th week. The 24 h urine protein (24 hUP), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and serum creatinine (SCr) were detected by the end of the 8th week. The transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), laminin (LN), collagen IV (Col-IV) expression were detected using immunohistochemical assay. The mRNA expressions of renal TGF-beta1, tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) were detected using RT-PCR.

The pathological changes showed obvious glomerular enlargement, the capillary loop expansion, the proliferation of the mesangial cells, increased mesangial matrix, widen and thicken glomerular basement membrane (GBM), and tubular derangement. The vacuolar degeneration and shedding could be seen in partial epithelial cells. The protein cast could also be seen with infiltration of interstitial inflammatory cells. Compared with the model group, each index of the two medication groups decreased with statistical difference (P<0.01). The pathological changes were less in the two medication groups. The mesangial cells were slightly proliferated and the mesangial matrix slightly increased. The mRNA expressions of SCr and PAI-1 were lower in the XC group than in the benazepril group (P<0.05). There was no statistical difference in the other indices between the two medication groups (P > 0.05). Conclusions XC had some protective effects and anti-glomerulosclerosis effects on early kidney injury in STZ-induced diabetic rats.

    "322": "We studied the effects of three various angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (enalapril, lisinopril and quinapril) on heart rhythm variability in anesthetized and immobilized rats. In all cases (except for quinapril in experiments on anesthetized animals), the preparations reduced the total rhythm variability and, according to spectrum analysis, increased activity of the parasympathetic autonomic nervous system to different degrees and decreased sympathetic tone. Quinapril and lisinopril produced the most pronounced influence on heart rhythm in anesthetized rats; enalapril was less potent in this respect. In immobilized animals, quinapril and enalapril showed the greatest activity and lisinopril the lowest. The more pronounced effect of quinapril both under anesthesia and during immobilization appears to be linked to the highest affinity of quinaprilat to circulatory and tissue compartments of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.",

Since replication of the murine hepatitis virus (MHV) is impaired upon proteasomal inhibition, the relevance of the UPS for the replication of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was investigated in this study. We demonstrate that the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 strongly inhibits SARS-CoV replication by interfering with early steps of the viral life cycle. Surprisingly, other proteasomal inhibitors (e.g., lactacystin and bortezomib) only marginally affected viral replication, indicating that the effect of MG132 is independent of proteasomal impairment. Induction of autophagy by MG132 treatment was excluded from playing a role, and no changes in SARS-CoV titers were observed during infection of wild-type or autophagy-deficient ATG5(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts overexpressing the human SARS-CoV receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Since MG132 also inhibits the cysteine protease m-calpain, we addressed the role of calpains in the early SARS-CoV life cycle using calpain inhibitors III (MDL28170) and VI (SJA6017). In fact, m-calpain inhibition with MDL28170 resulted in an even more pronounced inhibition of SARS-CoV replication (>7 orders of magnitude) than did MG132. Additional m-calpain knockdown experiments confirmed the dependence of SARS-CoV replication on the activity of the cysteine protease m-calpain. Taken together, we provide strong experimental evidence that SARS-CoV has unique replication requirements which are independent of functional UPS or autophagy pathways compared to other coronaviruses.

The Fosinopril in Dialysis Study failed to demonstrate the efficacy of 2-year angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition with fosinopril versus placebo in 397 hemodialysis patients with left ventricular hypertrophy but provided an opportunity to assess the influence of BP variability on cardiovascular events. The primary end point was the occurrence of a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, unstable angina, stroke, revascularization, hospitalization for heart failure, and resuscitated cardiac arrest. The variations in BP throughout the 17 visits were assessed by within-patient overall variability of systolic, diastolic, and pulse pressures between adjacent readings, by within-patient overall variability of systolic/diastolic/pulse pressures, and the residual of the linear fit. Compared with our previous predictive model of cardiovascular events occurrence based on stroke, peripheral arterial disease, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, left ventricular mass, and age (which exhibited similar coefficients herein), the percentage of explained variance improved by 30.1% (R(2)=0.141-0.183) when adding the coefficient of variation of within-patient overall variability of systolic BP. Usual BP parameters were neither cardiovascular events predictors nor correlated to BP variability. Visit-to-visit BP variability was extremely high in hemodialysis patients compared with other populations and a major determinant of cardiovascular events. Such assessments should be prioritized for testing prevention strategies in end-stage renal disease.", 
    "403": "A newly produced murine recombinant angiotensin (Ang)-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was characterized in vivo and in vitro. The effects of available ACE2 inhibitors (MLN-4760 and 2 conformational variants of DX600, linear and cyclic) were also examined. When murine ACE2 was given to mice for 4 weeks, a marked increase in serum ACE2 activity was sustainable. In acute studies, mouse ACE2 (1 mg/kg) obliterated hypertension induced by Ang II infusion by rapidly decreasing plasma Ang II. These effects were blocked by MLN-4760 but not by either form of DX600. In vitro, conversion from Ang II to Ang-(1-7) by mouse ACE2 was blocked by MLN-4760 (10(-6) m) but not by either form of DX600 (10(-5) m). Quantitative analysis of multiple Ang peptides in plasma ex vivo revealed formation of Ang-(1-9) from Ang I by human but not by mouse ACE2. Both human and mouse ACE2 led to the dissipation of Ang II with formation of Ang (1-7). By contrast, mouse ACE2-driven Ang-(1-7) formation from Ang II was blocked by MLN-4760 but not by either linear or cyclic DX600. In conclusion, sustained elevations in serum ACE2 activity can be accomplished with murine ACE2 administration, thereby providing a strategy for ACE2 amplification in chronic studies using rodent models of hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Human but not mouse ACE2 degrades Ang I to form Ang-(1-9). There are also species differences regarding rodent and human ACE2 inhibition by known inhibitors such that MLN-4760 inhibits both human and mouse ACE2, whereas DX600 only blocks human ACE2 activity.",

Eighteen hypertensive patients on chronic peritoneal dialysis were enrolled in an open-label comparative fixed-order study. The patients had been off RAAS blocking drugs for \u22654 weeks prior to an inclusion. At each of 3 study visits (baseline and after each of the treatment periods) blood pressure, serum lipids, potassium, renin, aldosterone, C-reactive protein (CRP) and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) were measured. After the baseline visit aliskiren was started (150 mg/d) and after 12 weeks replaced with ramipril (5 mg/d) for the next 12 weeks. Blood pressure was 142/88\u00b115/11 mmHg at baseline, 137/84\u00b110/8 mmHg after aliskiren (ns) and 126/81\u00b111/7 mmHg after ramipril (p<0.05 vs baseline and aliskiren). No incidents of hyperkalemia were observed. Plasma renin concentration increased significantly during aliskiren treatment compared to ramipril (227,6\u00b1844 vs. 58,3\u00b1765 pg/mL). CRP was similar after both therapies (8,8\u00b134 vs. 8,4\u00b132 \u00b5g/mL) but MCP-1 concentration was significantly lower after aliskiren than after ramipril (294,0\u00b1172,6 vs. 358,9\u00b1183,3 pg/mL). Aliskiren 150 mg/day decreases blood pressure less effectively than ramipril 5 mg/day in peritoneal dialysis patients. It does not influence serum potassium. The decrease of MCP-1 concentration after aliskiren treatment may provide an indirect evidence for its blood pressure independent cardioprotective and anti-inflammatory effects.",

This four month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pilot clinical trial evaluated the effects of ramipril, a blood-brain-barrier crossing ACE-I, in cognitively healthy individuals with mild, or Stage I hypertension. Fourteen participants were stratified by gender and apolipoprotein E \u03b54 (APOE \u03b54) status and randomized to receive 5 mg of ramipril or matching placebo daily. Participants were assessed at baseline and month 4 on measures of CSF A\u03b2(1-42) and ACE activity, arterial function, and cognition. Participants were middle-aged (mean 54 y) and highly educated (mean 15.4 y), and included 50% men and 50% APOE \u03b54 carriers. While results did not show a treatment effect on CSF A\u03b2(1-42) (p = 0.836), data revealed that ramipril can inhibit CSF ACE activity (p = 0.009) and improve blood pressure, however, there were no differences between groups in arterial function or cognition. In this study, ramipril therapy inhibited CSF ACE activity and improved blood pressure, but did not influence CSF A\u03b21-42. While larger trials are needed to confirm our CSF A\u03b2 results, it is possible that prior research reporting benefits of ACE-I during midlife may be attributed to alternative mechanisms including improvements in cerebral blood flow or the prevention of angiotensin II-mediated inhibition of acetylcholine.",

During the study period, 68% of subjects had detectable AVBS progression. On multivariate analysis, higher calcium concentrations (\u03b2 = 0.22; P = 0.004), poor platelet NO responsiveness (\u03b2 = 0.18; P = 0.018), and increased arterial stiffness (\u03b2 = 0.15; P = 0.044) were independent predictors of disease progression. The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers (ACE-I/ARB) predicted the lack of disease progression (assessed categorically) in the overall cohort and in those without ASc at baseline (n = 159) (\u03b2 = 0.8; P = 0.025 and \u03b2 = 1.3; P = 0.001, respectively).

These values were higher than the percentages of acrosome reactions in controls and the captopril group (P<0.05), although no difference was seen between the captopril and control groups (P>0.05). After 4h of incubation, motility in the control group (32.9%) was significantly higher than that in the heparin (15.7%) and captopril (12.1%) groups. No difference was found in motility after the capacitation assay in the heparin and captopril groups (P>0.05). In conclusion, ACE was immunologically localized in the acrosome of the spermatozoa of Holstein bull, the specific enzymatic activity of ACE in detergent-extracted spermatozoa and seminal plasma was inhibited by captopril, and this ACE inhibitor reduced the percentage of sperm with progressive motility and acrosome reactions after capacitation in vitro.",

As women are less likely to have significant stenosis in coronary angiography than men, they are regarded to be at smaller risk. At the same time, numerous studies prove that the prognosis of women with ischemic heart disease is serious. Therefore, some researchers suggest distinguishing the so-called \"female pattern\" of ischemic heart disease, characterized by persistent, often atypical chest pain, positive results for noninvasive tests evaluating ischemia and no significant changes in coronary angiography. It is relevant in the diagnosis of women to assess the global risk, taking into consideration such parameters as inflammation indicators, endothelial dysfunction and microvascular reactivity.

Mast cell numbers were increased and interstitial collagen was decreased at 4 and 15 wk ACF, despite increases in LV ACE and chymase activities. Treatment with the kallikrein inhibitor aprotinin preserved interstitial collagen, prevented the increase in mast cells, and improved LV systolic function at 4 wk ACF. To establish a cause and effect between ISF bradykinin and mast cell-mediated collagen loss, direct LV interstitial bradykinin infusion in vivo for 24 hrs produced a 2-fold increase in mast cell numbers and a 30% decrease in interstitial collagen, which were prevented by BK(2)R antagonist. To further connect myocardial stretch with cellular kallikrein-kinin system upregulation, 24 hrs cyclic stretch of adult cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts produced increased kallikrein, BK(2)R mRNA expressions, bradykinin protein and gelatinase activity, which were all decreased by the kallikrein inhibitor-aprotinin.",

In spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), stem-EE effectively reduced blood pressure 24 h after administration of a single oral dose or when administered daily for 4 weeks. The isolated compounds, including (+)-vitisin A, ampelopsin C, and (+)-\u03b5-viniferin, were shown to have anti-ACE and vasodilating effects against phenylephrine-induced tensions in an endothelium-intact aortic ring, with (+)-vitisin A being the most effective compound. Compared to control rats, SHRs showed significantly reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressures 24 h after a single oral dose of (+)-vitisin A (10 mg/kg) or captopril (2 mg/kg).

By far the highest ACE inhibition was found for a lettuce extract, in which the most active compound was located by means of activity-guided fractionation. LC-MS, NMR spectroscopy, and hydrolysis experiments followed by ion chromatography led to the unequivocal identification of the ACE inhibitor as the previously not reported (S)-malic acid 1'-O-\u03b2-gentiobioside. This glycoside represents a novel class of ACE-inhibiting phytochemicals with a low IC(50) value of 27.8 \u03bcM.

Previously in experimental DN we showed that Na/K ATPase (NKA) is mislocated and angiotensin II leads to superimposed renal progression. Here we investigated the monotherapeutic effect of aldosterone blockers on the progression of DN and renal NKA alteration in comparison to ACEi and ARBs. Streptozotocin-diabetic rats developing DN were treated with aldosterone antagonists; ACEi and ARB. Renal function, morphology, protein level and tubular localization of NKA were analyzed. To evaluate the effect of high glucose per se; HK-2 proximal tubular cells were cultured in normal or high concentration of glucose and treated with the same agents. Aldosterone antagonists were the most effective in ameliorating functional and structural kidney damage and they normalized diabetes induced bradycardia and weight loss. Aldosterone blockers also prevented hyperglycemia and diabetes induced increase in NKA protein level and enzyme mislocation. A monotherapy with aldosterone antagonists might be as, or more effective than ACEi or ARBs in the prevention of STZ-induced DN. Furthermore the alteration of the NKA could represent a novel pathophysiological feature of DN and might serve as an additional target of aldosterone blockers.",

Pulmonary function tests, plasma natriuretic peptides, echocardiography and cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging should be carried out to acquire the objective evidence of pulmonary and cardiac function when necessary. Robust studies indicate that patients with COPD tolerate the cardioselective \u03b2-blockers well, so it should not be denied to CHF patients with concomitant COPD. Low-dose initiation and gradual uptitration of cardioselective \u03b2-blockers is currently recommended.

We tested 140 with MI individuals for factor V (FV) Leiden, FV H1299R, Prothrombin G20210A, factor XIII (FXIII) V34L, \u03b2-fibrinogen b-455G/A, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1)-675 4G/5G, human platelet antigens 1 (HPA-1) a/b, apolipoprotein B (ApoB) R3500Q, apolipoprotein E (ApoE), E2, E3, and E4, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) D/I, 5,10 methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) 677C/T, and MTHFR 1298A/C polymorphisms using a ViennaLab CVD strip assay. This study results were compared without MI control groups. According to the our results, prothrombin, factor XIII and MTHFRC677T deletions were the most frequent genetic variants in risk groups of hyperlipidemic patients (value of odds ratio sequentially [OR] = 4.5, p = 0.05, [OR] = 2.16, p = 0.04 and [OR] = 2.8, p = 0.09). MTHFRA1298C and PAI-1 deletions were most frequent genetic variants in risk groups for MI in patients with diabetes mellitus (value of odds ratio sequentially [OR] = 3.79, p = 0.06 and [OR] = 5 \u00d7 10(8), p = 0.000). ACE deletions were positively associated with family history of cardiovascular events (OR = 3.62, p = 0.03). We found a strong relationship between genetic variants and risk factors. Significant associations between genetic variants predicting cardiovascular events and common risk factors (hyperlipidemia, smoking, diabetes mellitus and family history) patients were found.", 
    "479": "There is a current need for new therapeutic options for acetaminophen (APAP)-induced hepatotoxicity. Herein, we assessed the effects of prophylactic and therapeutic treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, enalapril, on APAP-caused hepatotoxicity. Male and female C57BL/6\u00a0J mice were used, and hepatotoxicity was induced by a single application of APAP (400\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.). Macroscopic and histological liver alterations, serum alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) activity, liver catalase activity (CAT), reduced glutathione concentrations (GSH), hepatic measurement of neutrophil migration (myeloperoxidase, MPO activity), and caspase-3 liver expression were evaluated. The prophylactic and the therapeutic treatments with enalapril were able to markedly reduce the macroscopic and histological liver alterations as well as the caspase-3 immunopositivity. Both schedules of treatment were also effective in reducing GSH concentrations as well as neutrophil migration. Conversely, only the pre-treatment (but not the post-administration) with enalapril significantly reversed APAP-induced CAT decrease. Furthermore, the pre- or the post-treatment with enalapril largely reduced ALT and AST serum activity in APAP-intoxicated mice. The hepatoprotective effects of enalapril were comparable to those obtained with the clinically used compound N-acetylcysteine (NAC) when given in a therapeutic regimen. Data obtained with the prophylactic protocol of treatment might indicate that individuals under treatment with ACE inhibitors are less susceptible to the toxic effects of APAP. Additionally, the therapeutic approach allows us to suggest that enalapril might represent an innovative tool for treating APAP intoxication.",

For the 8429 patients aged less than 60 years, high frequency of low-income and full health insurance coverage (11% of the covered population) was found for CI (17.6%) and CH (24.6%). Specific refund for invalidating stroke before hospitalization was found for 16% of patients with CI and 10.5% of those with CH. During the two previous years, around 7% of all patients were hospitalized for stroke, 30% for arterial hypertension, 13% for cardiac electric disorders, 10% for coronary disease and 12% for diabetes.

An incident cohort of adult patients 18\u2003years and older prescribed an ACE inhibitor or ARB between 2001 and 2008 was identified from Geisinger Clinic, a large community-based set of medical practices that uses a common electronic health record. Propensity score matching was used to balance the groups on baseline factors. The authors examined differences in mortality and new-onset coronary disease, chronic kidney disease, stroke, and diabetes for different patient subgroups based on sex and age. A total of 25,035 hypertensive patients newly prescribed an ACE inhibitor or ARB were identified. No differences were found in risk of death, coronary disease, chronic kidney disease, or stroke between those prescribed ACE inhibitors and those prescribed ARBs. Patients prescribed ARBs had a greater rate of new-onset diabetes (hazard ratio [HR], 1.28; confidence interval [CI], 1.08-1.52), and this was especially true for women (HR, 1.93; CI, 1.22-3.07).

    "492": "Hypertension is a growing global health problem, and is predicted to affect 1.56 billion people by 2025. Treatment remains suboptimal, with control of blood pressure achieved in only 20%-35% of patients, and the majority requiring two or more antihypertensive drugs to achieve recommended blood pressure goals. To improve blood pressure control, the European hypertension guidelines recommend that angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) are combined with calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and/or thiazide diuretics. The rationale for this strategy is based, in part, on their different effects on the renin-angiotensin system, which improves antihypertensive efficacy. Data from a large number of trials support the efficacy of ACEIs or ARBs in combination with CCBs and/or hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). Combining two different classes of antihypertensive drugs has an additive effect on lowering of blood pressure, and does not increase adverse events, with the ARBs showing a tolerability advantage over the ACEIs. Among the different ARBs, olmesartan medoxomil is available as a dual fixed-dose combination with either amlodipine or HCTZ, and the increased blood pressure-lowering efficacy of these two combinations is proven. Triple therapy is required in 15%-20% of treated uncontrolled hypertensive patients, with a renin-angiotensin system blocker, CCB, and thiazide diuretic considered to be a rational combination according to the European guidelines. Olmesartan, amlodipine, and HCTZ are available as a triple fixed-dose combination, and significant blood pressure reductions have been observed with this regimen compared with the possible dual combinations. The availability of these fixed-dose combinations should lead to improvement in blood pressure control and aid compliance with long-term therapy, optimizing the management of this chronic condition.",

The subjects were from two cohort studies which investigated the risk factors of osteoporotic fractures in Hong Kong-dwelling elderly Chinese. A total of 2161 subjects (1280 male, 881 female) were selected for this analysis. The results showed that unadjusted annualized percentage bone loss of male ACE inhibitor users was not different from non-users; however, female ACE inhibitor users had significantly greater bone loss both in total hip and femoral neck than non-users. After adjusting for significant confounders, female continuous ACE inhibitor users had significantly greater bone loss at total hip and femoral neck. In conclusion, continuous use of ACE inhibitors over 4\u00a0years was associated with increased bone loss in total hip and femoral neck in older Chinese women.",

Because in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1)-induced sPLA2-V expression, and LPC content in LDL and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 mRNA were enhanced by incubation of LDL with TNF\u03b1-stimulated HUVEC, we investigated whether an angiotensin II receptor type 1 blocker, telmisartan, or an antioxidant drug, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), suppressed TNF\u03b1-induced sPLA2-V expression. Telmisartan or NAC administered before and during TNF\u03b1 stimulation diminished the increase of sPLA2-V mRNA in HUVEC and reduced TNF\u03b1-induced sPLA2-V protein at 3 days after TNF\u03b1 stimulation. Angiotensin II did not induce sPLA2-V mRNA, and a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 antagonist, GW3335, did not influence the inhibitory effect of telmisartan on TNF\u03b1-induced sPLA2-V mRNA. At 3 days after TNF\u03b1 stimulation, 30 \u03bcM telmisartan or 20 mM NAC administered before and during TNF\u03b1 stimulation prevented the enhancement of LPC content in LDL and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 mRNA by LDL incubation with TNF\u03b1-stimulated HUVEC. A 2-month treatment with telmisartan in 29 hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients significantly reduced LPC content in circulating LDL. Telmisartan's suppressive effect on TNF\u03b1-induced sPLA2-V expression may have beneficial effects in preventing proatherogenic changes of LDL.", 
    "495": "Diastolic dysfunction is present in half of patients with hypertension and has been shown to be associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, as well as the development of heart failure. With the high prevalence of hypertension and its associated complications, treatment of diastolic dysfunction in hypertension is an important and desirable goal. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers have been shown to be effective in improvement of measures of diastolic function and are recommended as first-line agents in the control of hypertension in patients with diastolic heart failure. Beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and diuretics have also shown some efficacy in improved indices of diastolic filling. However, the independent impact of these pharmacologic interventions on prognosis and outcome in diastolic dysfunction has yet to be clarified. The Irbesartan in Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (I-PRESERVE) study, Candesartan in Heart Failure: Assessment in Reduction of Mortality and Morbidity (CHARM-Preserved) trial and the Losartan Intervention For End-point Reduction in Hypertension (LIFE) Study all failed to show improved morbidity and mortality with these drugs although, the LIFE study showed reduced heart failure hospitalization in hypertensive patients with normal in-treatment diastolic function. The Trial Of Preserved Cardiac function heart failure with an Aldosterone anTagonist (TOPCAT) is an on-going large, international study evaluating the effect of spironolactone on cardiovascular mortality, aborted cardiac arrest, or hospitalization for diastolic heart failure. This and other studies will provide further insight into the pathophysiology and management of patients with diastolic dysfunction.", 
    "496": "Angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)] plays a beneficial role in cardiovascular physiology by providing a counterbalance to the function of angiotensin II (Ang II). Although Ang II has been shown to be an adipokine secreted by adipocyte and affect lipid metabolism, the role of Ang-(1-7) in adipose tissue remains to be clarified. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether Ang-(1-7) affects lipid metabolism in adipose tissue. Ang-(1-7) increased glycerol release from primary adipocytes in a dose-dependent manner. A lipolytic effect of Ang-(1-7) was attenuated by pretreatment with A-779, a Mas receptor blocker and with an inhibitor of phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), or eNOS. However, losartan and PD123319 did not cause any change in Ang-(1-7)-induced lipolysis. Ang-(1-7)-induced lipolysis had an addictive effect with isoproterenol. In normal rats, chronic intake of captopril for 4 wks decreased body weight gain and the amount of adipose tissue and increased plasma Ang-(1-7) level. These effects were attenuated by administration of A-779. The levels of Mas receptor and phosphorylation of hormone-sensitive lipase (p-HSL) were significantly increased by treatment with captopril and these captopril-mediated effects were attenuated by the administration of A-779. There was no difference in diameter of adipocytes among sham, captopril- and captopril+A-779-treated groups. The similar effects of captopril on body weight, expression of Mas receptor, and p-HSL were observed in Ang-(1-7)-treated rats. These results suggest that captopril intake decreased body weight gain partly through Ang-(1-7)/Mas receptor/PI3K pathway.",

In order to broaden the range of matrices and implicitly to develop the class of drug delivery systems based on diffusion mechanism, in this study the starting materials, SBA-15 powder matrices, were engineered by MgO modification for antihypertensive drugs intercalation. Captopril and aliskiren were used as drug models. All powders, unmodified and MgO-modified silica matrices, and their corresponding drug-loaded samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, N(2) adsorption and desorption, FTIR spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The studied drug carriers were tested in the controlled drug release process and the influence of the silica pore morphology and geometry on drug release profiles was extensively studied. In order to analyze the data obtained from the in vitro release studies and to evaluate the kinetic release mechanism, the Korsmeyer and Peppas equation was used. The obtained drug delivery system based on MgO-SBA-15 matrix exhibits exciting structural features and is therefore promising for its use as antihypertensive drug delivery system, having potential therapeutic benefits resulting in safe and effective management of captopril and aliskiren adsorption and in vitro release.",

On the fifth day, however, it decreased to 20/40 and choroidal detachment was detected at the posterior pole. We suspected an increase of choroidal vascular permeability and started oral steroid therapy. After 1 week, the area of detachment was smaller and her acuity improved to 20/20. Subsequently, she underwent cataract surgery without sub-Tenon anesthesia on her right eye, and no choroidal detachment occurred.",

    "501": "Plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) is one of the most important inhibitors of endogenous fibrinolysis. Adipose tissue is a suggested source of the elevated plasma levels of PAI-1 in obesity. The relation between PAI-1 and inflammation is of particular interest, but current knowledge regarding regulation of PAI-1 in adipose tissue is mainly based on animal studies or ex vivo experiments on human cultured adipocytes. So far, no study has described stimulated gene expression and protein synthesis of PAI-1 in vivo in human adipose tissue. We used open heart surgery as a model of acute systemic inflammation. Twenty-two male patients underwent blood sampling and omental and subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies for gene expression studies before and after surgery. Expression and localisation of PAI-1 antigen was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. After surgery gene expression of PAI-1 increased 27-fold in omental adipose tissue and three-fold in subcutaneous adipose tissue, but no differences were found in tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) mRNA. PAI-1 antigen was localised within endothelial cells and in the adipose tissue interstitium close to vessels. The upregulated gene expression and protein synthesis in adipose tissue was followed by increased concentrations of PAI-1 antigen in plasma. In conclusion, we present for the first time that an acute systemic inflammation in humans increased gene expression and protein synthesis of PAI-1 in adipose tissue and that this increase was most prominent in omental adipose tissue. PAI-1 synthesis in adipose tissue due to acute systemic inflammation may be a link between inflammation and impaired endogenous fibrinolysis.",

They are routinely used in adults; however, their efficacy and safety in children, in whom the causes of chronic kidney disease are significantly different relative to adults, is uncertain. Here we assessed an open-label extension of a previous 3-month blinded trial, in which the efficacy and tolerability of losartan was compared to placebo or amlodipine in 306 normotensive and hypertensive children with proteinuria. In this study, 268 children were re-randomized to losartan or enalapril and followed until 100 patients completed 3 years of follow-up for proteinuria and renal function. The least squares percent mean reduction from baseline in the urinary protein/creatinine ratio was 30.01% for losartan and 40.45% for enalapril. The least squares mean change from baseline in eGFR was 3.3\u2009ml/min per 1.73\u2009m2 for losartan and 7.0\u2009ml/min per 1.73\u2009m2 for enalapril. The incidence of specific adverse events such as hyperkalemia and renal dysfunction was low and similar in both groups. Both were generally well tolerated and, overall, fewer drug-related adverse events occurred with losartan than with enalapril. Thus, in children with proteinuria, losartan and enalapril significantly reduced proteinuria without any appreciable changes in eGFR, effects that were maintained throughout the study. Both losartan and enalapril were generally well tolerated.", 
    "503": "The present study compared the effects of resveratrol and its dimer \u03b5-viniferin on vascular endothelial cells (VECs) functions, and on the blood pressure and cardiac mass of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Treatment of VECs with these compounds enhanced cell proliferation via nitric oxide generation and protected the cells from oxidative stress by suppressing increases in intracellular oxygen species. \u03b5-Viniferin was more potent than resveratrol in most of these effects. \u03b5-Viniferin, but not resveratrol inhibited angiotensin-converting enzyme activity in vitro. Three weeks of \u03b5-viniferin treatment (5 mg/kg) reduced the systolic blood pressure and improved the whole cardiac mass and left ventricle mass indexes in SHRs. In contrast, resveratrol administration (2.5 mg/kg) failed to lower the blood pressure and significantly improve these mass indexes. These data suggest that \u03b5-viniferin as well as resveratrol may be involved in protecting the functions of VECs and the heart.",

The link between a high heart rate and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has been demonstrated in the general population, as well as in patients with hypertension, coronary artery disease, and chronic heart failure. Ivabradine is a specific inhibitor of the if current in the sino-atrial node, without any other known cardiovascular effect, such as myocardial contraction or intracardiac conduction.

The significance of both the model and its parameters as well as the value of the regression coefficient was used as criteria to select the most adequate model for obtaining the IC(50) values corresponding to each bioactive peptides mixture. The best results were obtained with the Michaelis-Menten-based model because it provided the best fits and in addition the values for its parameters were always significant. As parameters of this model have a physical meaning, it could be used for inhibition-testing experiments in the development of novel bioactive peptides. The results obtained indicated that the peptide mixture derived from the neutrase hydrolysis exhibited strong ACE inhibition activity. The main active peptides were short, with molecular masses below 1 kDa (IC(50) = 40.37 \u00b1 2.66 \u03bcg/mL) and represent 38% of the initial protein content in the hydrolysate.",

Therefore, the aims of this study were to develop a novel method for determining drug switching from routinely acquired NHS health data and to explore the aspect of continuation of care for patients. Patients who were first prescribed ramipril, simvastatin and an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) between 1 March 2004 and 28 February 2007 and discontinued their medication within 6 months of the index prescription were identified from the PTI database. The identified patients were then categorized into three groups: i) patients who were switched to a different drug for the same medical condition, ii) patients who were being prescribed with other types of antihypertensive/lipid-regulating drug prior to the initiation of study; and iii) patients who were without any continuation of care or therapy. Twenty percent (808), 29%(1429) and 14%(455) of the identified patients discontinued ramipril, simvastatin and ARB, respectively, within 6 months of an index prescription. Among the ramipril discontinuation group, 36.4% of the patients were switched to another antihypertensive, while another 31.6% of them were without continuation of care. In patients discontinuing ARB, 30.6% were switched, while another 30.1% were without continuation of treatment. In patients discontinuing simvastatin, 28.8% were switched to another lipid-regulating medicine, while another 63.1% of them were without continuation of care. The results of this study confirm that primary care prescribing databases can be used to determine drug-switching information and continuation of care/therapy.",

The rate of death within 5 years was significantly lower in the group IB (43 \u00b1 11%, n = 10), when compared with the group IA (91 \u00b1 6%, n = 33; P = 0.001) and the group II (100%, n = 23; P < 0.001). The Cox proportional hazard model analysis demonstrated that the hazard ratio for death in the group IB remained significantly lower than in the other groups, even after adjustment for currently established risk factors.

Medication adherence and intensification improve blood pressure (BP) control; however, little is known about these processes or their association with outcomes in resistant hypertension. This retrospective study included patients from 2002 to 2006 with incident hypertension from 2 health systems who developed resistant hypertension or uncontrolled BP despite adherence to \u22653 antihypertensive medications. Patterns of hypertension treatment, medication adherence (percentage of days covered), and treatment intensification (increase in medication class or dose) were described in the year after resistant hypertension identification. Then, the association between medication adherence and intensification with 1-year BP control was assessed controlling for patient characteristics. Of the 3550 patients with resistant hypertension, 49% were male, and mean age was 60 years. One year after resistance hypertension determination, fewer patients were taking diuretics (77.7% versus 92.2%; P<0.01), \u03b2-blockers (71.2% versus 79.4%; P<0.01), and angiotensinogen-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker (64.8% versus 70.1%; P<0.01) compared with baseline. Rates of BP control improved over 1 year (22% versus 55%; P<0.01). During this year, adherence was not associated with 1-year BP control (adjusted odds ratio, 1.18 [95% CI: 0.94-1.47]). Treatment was intensified in 21.6% of visits with elevated BP. Increasing treatment intensity was associated with 1-year BP control (adjusted odds ratio, 1.64 [95% CI, 1.58-1.71]). In this cohort of patients with resistant hypertension, treatment intensification but not medication adherence was significantly associated with 1-year BP control. These findings highlight the need to investigate why patients with uncontrolled BP do not receive treatment intensification.", 
    "513": "The mechanisms of cardiovascular protective effects of ghrelin and its synthetic analogs are still largely unknown. Our first aim was to ascertain whether or not natural and synthetic ligands of GHS-R1a are capable of interfering with the activity of the renin-angiotensin system. Second, since polymorphisms in the ACE gene have been associated with Alzheimer's dementia (AD) and ACE is potentially involved in brain \u03b2-amyloid degradation, we also investigated the state of ghrelin axis and inflammatory markers in patients with AD and vascular dementia (VaD). Desacyl ghrelin, hexarelin, EP80317, and GHRP-6 all significantly inhibited ACE activity in vitro; by comparison, the efficacies of ghrelin and MK-0677 were significantly lower, suggesting that ACE-inhibiting activity is unrelated to ligand affinity to GHS-R1a. ACE was capable of cleaving A\u03b2in vitro, reducing its ability to aggregate in fibrillar A\u03b2. Interestingly, this protective effect of ACE was blunted by enalapril but not hexarelin or EP80317. Desacyl ghrelin levels were lower in VaD subjects compared with AD and control subjects, whereas ghrelin and TNF-\u03b1 levels were similar in all groups. VaD subjects demonstrated greater levels of mRNA for GHS-R1a, PPAR-\u03b3 and CD36 in peripheral blood lymphocytes compared with other groups. In conclusion, some GHSs are effective ACE-inhibitors, and this activity may contribute to their cardiovascular effects. Hexarelin or EP80317 do not inhibit the N-domain of ACE, which is also involved in the metabolism of \u03b2-amyloid, suggesting the possibility of developing new antihypertensive drugs with improved therapeutic potential.", 
    "514": "Previous studies have shown that postweaning protein restriction induces changes in the sympathetic nervous system in rats, leading to alterations in cardiovascular parameters. In addition, the renin-angiotensin system is also affected in these animals. Here, we hypothesized that adjustments in the interaction between the RAS and SNS underlie the cardiovascular adaptations observed in rats fed a low-protein diet. Thus, we evaluated the alterations in the mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate of Fisher rats fed a protein-deficient diet before and after systemic administration of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril and the angiotensin II (Ang II) type 1 (AT(1)) receptor antagonist losartan alone or in combination with the \u03b1(1)-adrenergic receptor antagonist prazosin. Administration of enalapril or losartan decreased the MAP only of rats under protein restriction. Prazosin injection after the infusion of losartan caused a further decrease in the MAP of malnourished rats. In contrast, only the administration of prazosin elicited a reduction in the MAP of control animals. When the sequence of administration of the antagonists was inverted, infusion of prazosin in animals fed the standard or the low-protein diet induced a reduction in the MAP that was further decreased by the subsequent injection of losartan. Importantly, in both protocols the responses of malnourished animals to losartan were markedly greater when compared with the control group. Moreover, these animals presented lower levels of circulating Ang II and a reduced responsiveness to Ang II. In contrast, the expression of AT(1) receptors in the aorta of malnourished animals was increased. Thus, our data suggest that the renin-angiotensin system is an important factor supporting blood pressure in rats fed a low-protein diet and that the sympathetic nervous system activity in these animals is under strong influence of Ang II acting via AT(1) receptors.",

    "519": "Fosinopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, is known to attenuate cardiomyopathy induced by doxorubicin (DOX); however, the mechanisms of this cardioprotection are not fully elucidated yet. In the present study, experimental cardiomyopathy was induced in rats by administration of DOX with or without co-treatment with fosinopril. Fosinopril was utilized on day 1 or 14 of the treatment with DOX to compare efficacies of early versus late co-treatments. We observed that fosinopril attenuated changes induced by DOX (e.g., less increased heart and left ventricular weights, diminished lung congestion and ascites, attenuated LVEDP and LVSP, and less decreased +dP/dt and -dP/dt). Further, fosinopril diminished the levels of markers of cardiac toxicity (i.e., plasma levels and activities of cardiac enzymes and proteins AST, LDH, CPK, cTnI, and BNP). Fosinopril also prevented DOX-induced decreases in Ca(2+) uptake and restored activity of Ca(2+)-stimulated ATPase in left ventricular sarcoplasmic reticulum. We next tested whether the improved Ca(2+) transport activity in sarcoplasmic reticulum was due to modulation of SERCA2 and phospholamban expressions by fosinopril. Fosinopril attenuated the decrease in SERCA2 and phospholamban expressions caused by DOX. In conclusion, cardioprotective effects of fosinopril in the DOX-induced cardiomyopathy appear to be due to its ability to prevent remodeling of the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane.",

    "528": "The association between preoperative use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and outcomes after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) remain controversial. Our aim was to study in-hospital outcomes after isolated CABG in patients on preoperative ACE inhibitors. A retrospective analysis of 8,889 patients who underwent isolated CABG from 2000 through 2011 was conducted. The primary outcome of interest was the incidence of major adverse events (MAEs) defined as a composite of mortality, postoperative renal dysfunction, myocardial infarction, stroke, and atrial fibrillation during index hospitalization. The secondary outcome was the incidence of individual outcomes included in MAEs. Logistic regression analyses were performed. Of 8,889 patients, 3,983 (45%) were on preoperative ACE inhibitors and 4,906 (55%) were not. Overall incidence of MAEs was 38.1% (n = 1,518) in the ACE inhibitor group compared to 33.6% (n = 1,649) in the no-ACE inhibitor group. Preoperative use of ACE inhibitors was independently associated with MAEs (odds ratio 1.13, 95% confidence interval 1.03 to 1.24), most of which was driven by a statistically significant increase in postoperative renal dysfunction (odds ratio 1.18, 95% confidence interval 1.03 to 1.36) and atrial fibrillation (odds ratio 1.15, 95% confidence interval 1.05 to 1.27). In-hospital mortality, postoperative myocardial infarction, and stroke were not significantly associated with preoperative ACE inhibitor use. Analyses performed after excluding patients with low ejection fractions yielded similar results. In conclusion, preoperative ACE inhibitor use was associated with an increased risk of MAEs after CABG, in particular postoperative renal dysfunction and atrial fibrillation.", 
    "529": "Here, we briefly review the role of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in cognitive impairment and neurodegenerative disease, mainly discussing our experimental studies on the angiotensin II type 2 (AT(2)) receptor. Ischemic brain damage is enhanced in mice with overexpression of angiotensin II, with reduced cerebral blood flow in the penumbra and an increase in oxidative stress in the ischemic area. Angiotensin II binds two types of receptors, type 1 (AT(1)) and type 2 (AT(2)). Our previous experiments showed that AT(1) receptor signaling has a harmful effect, and AT(2) receptor signaling has a protective effect on the brain after stroke. AT(2) receptor signaling in bone marrow stromal cells or hematopoietic cells was shown to prevent ischemic brain damage after middle cerebral artery occlusion. In contrast, AT(2) receptor signaling also affects cognitive function. We showed that direct stimulation of the AT(2) receptor by a newly generated direct AT(2) receptor agonist, Compound 21 (C21), enhanced cognitive function in wild-type (C57BL6) mice and an Alzheimer's disease mouse model with intracerebroventricular injection of amyloid \u03b2 (1-40). Finally, we carried out clinical research by investigating the levels of RAS components in patients with neurodegenerative diseases. We observed a reduction of angiotensin II and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2 levels, and an increase in ACE level in cerebrospinal fluid from patients with multiple sclerosis. These results suggest that RAS is also involved in neurodegenerative disease. Therefore, regulation of RAS might be a new therapeutic target to protect neurons from neural diseases.",

    "551": "Myocarditis is defined as acute inflammation of the myocardium, usually following a non-specific flu-like illness, and encompasses a wide range of clinical presentations ranging from mild or subclinical disease to heart failure. We report a 12-day-old healthy full-term neonate who presented with abrupt onset of congestive cardiac failure (CCF) following a viral prodrome. Examination revealed persistent sinus tachycardia, lymphocytosis, gross cardiomegaly, nonspecific electrocardiogram changes with echocardiography showing Swiss cheese ventricular septal defect (VSD). VSD alone very rarely presents as early-onset cardiac failure in the absence of other precipitating factors like anemia, sepsis, hypoglycemia etc. Myocarditis, however, can mimic VSD and can present as fulminant cardiac failure in an otherwise healthy newborn. Myocarditis is usually diagnosed based on circumstantial evidence such as a recent viral infection and the sudden onset of cardiac dysfunction while ruling out other diagnostic possibilities. Elevated troponin T level is one of the most crucial noninvasive diagnostic modalities. Several trials have concluded that levels >0.055 ng/ml are statistically significant for diagnosing myocarditis in children. In our case an abrupt onset of cardiac failure following a viral prodrome and markedly elevated cardiac troponin T without sepsis and in the presence of normal coronary anatomy clinched the diagnosis of myocarditis. An early and aggressive treatment for CCF along with regular long-term follow-up plays a key role in the management of myocarditis. Role of high-dose Intravenous immunoglobulin in myocarditis has been studied by many trials with different outcomes. This is the first case report showing coexistence of VSD with myocarditis in a neonate presenting as early-onset acute cardiac failure. The report highlights the importance of screening for myocarditis in all previously normal babies presenting primarily with cardiogenic symptoms even if a structural heart disease is coexistent early in life.

    "552": "The RAS (renin-angiotensin system) is activated after MI (myocardial infarction), and RAS blockade with ACEis [ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors] or ARBs (angiotensin receptor blockers) slows but does not completely prevent progression to heart failure. Cardiac ACE is increased after MI and leads to the formation of the vasoconstrictor AngII (angiotensin II). The enzyme ACE2 is also activated after MI and degrades AngII to generate the vasodilator Ang-(1-7) [angiotensin-(1-7)]. Overexpression of ACE2 offers cardioprotective effects in experimental MI, but there is conflicting evidence as to whether the benefits of ACEis and ARBs are mediated through increasing ACE2 after MI. In the present study, we assessed the effect of an ACEi and ARB, alone and in combination, on cardiac ACE2 in a rat MI model. MI rats received vehicle, ACEi (ramipril; 1 mg/kg of body weight), ARB (valsartan; 10 mg/kg of body weight) or combination (ramipril at 1 mg/kg of body weight and valsartan at 10 mg/kg of body weight) orally for 28 days. Sham-operated rats were also studied and received vehicle alone. MI increased LV (left ventricular) mass (P<0.0001), impaired cardiac contractility (P<0.05) and activated cardiac ACE2 with increased gene (P<0.05) and protein expression (viable myocardium, P<0.05; border zone, P<0.001; infarct, P<0.05). Ramipril and valsartan improved remodelling (P<0.05), with no additional effect of dual therapy. Although ramipril inhibited ACE, and valsartan blocked the angiotensin receptor, neither treatment alone nor in combination augmented cardiac ACE2 expression. These results suggest that the cardioprotective effects of ramipril and valsartan are not mediated through up-regulation of cardiac ACE2. Strategies that do augment ACE2 after MI may be a useful addition to standard RAS blockade after MI.",

The aim of this study was to determine whether Cx40 and Cx43 play different roles in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) involved in the remodeling of GJs in VSMCs under pathological conditions. A total of 28 male New Zealand white rabbits were divided medially into four groups: control, sham injury, injury and injury plus ramipril (0.5 mg/kg/day in the diet for two weeks). The animals were used to set up the rabbit model of arterial balloon injury. Transmission electron microscopy, western blotting, immunohistochemistry and reverse transcription\u2011polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were performed on four samples of ballooned iliac arteries. Larger and more abundant GJs appeared in neointimal VSMCs and there were smaller and fewer GJs following ramipril treatment. mRNA and protein expression levels and level of immunostaining of Cx40 and Cx43 were consistently increased following injury. Although ramipril reduced the change in the levels of Cx43, no significant changes in Cx40 immunostaining, protein or mRNA levels were observed in the ramipril treatments. Ramipril may inhibit neointimal formation and downregulate the expression of Cx43 protein and mRNA, but the drug had no significant effect on the Cx40 protein and mRNA levels, suggesting that it was not Cx40 but Cx43 in GJs that contributes to the process of angiotensin\u00a0II (Ang II)-converting enzyme inhibitors inhibiting the prolife-ration of VSMCs in balloon injury.",

By using in vivo specific and selective aminopeptidase A and aminopeptidase N inhibitors, we showed that angiotensin III is one of the main effector peptides of the brain renin-angiotensin system, exerting a tonic stimulatory control more than blood pressure in hypertensive rats. Aminopeptidase A, the enzyme generating brain angiotensin III, thus represents a potential target for the treatment of hypertension. We demonstrated here the antihypertensive effects of RB150, a prodrug of the specific and selective aminopeptidase A inhibitor, EC33, in spontaneously hypertensive rats, a model of human essential hypertension. Oral administration of RB150 in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats inhibited brain aminopeptidase A activity, demonstrating the central bioavailability of RB150 and its ability to generate EC33 into the brain. Oral RB150 treatment dose-dependently reduced blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats with an ED(50) of 30 mg/kg, lasting for several hours. This decrease in blood pressure is partly attributed to a decrease in sympathetic tone, reducing vascular resistance. This treatment did not modify systemic renin-angiotensin system activity. Concomitant oral administration of RB150 with a systemic renin-angiotensin system blocker, enalapril, potentiated the RB150-induced blood pressure decrease achieved in <2 hours. Thus, RB150 may be the prototype of a new class of centrally active antihypertensive agents that might be used in combination with classic systemic renin-angiotensin system blockers to improve blood pressure control.",

In this study, it was hypothesized that the RVLM may be one of the sites of cardiovascular actions of a newly discovered angiotensin, angiotensin-(1-12) [Ang-(1-12)]. Experiments were carried out in urethane-anaesthetized, artificially ventilated, adult male Wistar rats. The RVLM was identified by microinjections of L-glutamate (5 mM). The volume of all microinjections into the RVLM was 100 nl. Microinjections of Ang-(1-12) (0.1-1.0 mM) into the RVLM elicited increases in mean arterial pressure and heart rate. Maximal cardiovascular responses were elicited by 0.5 mM Ang-(1-12); this concentration was used in the other experiments described. Microinjections of Ang-(1-12) increased greater splanchnic nerve activity. The tachycardic responses to Ang-(1-12) were not altered by bilateral vagotomy. The cardiovascular responses elicited by Ang-(1-12) were attenuated by microinjections of an angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT(1)R) antagonist (losartan), but not an AT(2)R antagonist (PD123319), into the RVLM. Combined inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme and chymase in the RVLM abolished Ang-(1-12)-induced responses. Angiotensin-(1-12)-immunoreactive cells were present in the RVLM. Angiotensin II type 1 receptors and phenylethanolamine-N-methyl-transferase were present in the RVLM neurons retrogradely labelled by microinjections of Fluoro-Gold into the intermediolateral cell column of the thoracic spinal cord. Angiotensin-(1-12)-containing neurons in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus did not project to the RVLM. These results indicated that: (1) microinjections of Ang-(1-12) into the RVLM elicited increases in mean arterial pressure, heart rate and greater splanchnic nerve activity; (2) both angiotensin-converting enzyme and chymase were needed to convert Ang-(1-12) into angiotensin II; and (3) AT(1)Rs, but not AT(2)Rs, in the RVLM mediated the Ang-(1-12)-induced responses.",

    "586": "\u00a0Carnosine (beta-alanyl-L-histidine) is an endogenously synthesized dipeptide which is present in different human tissues, including the kidney. Carnosine is hydrolyzed by the enzyme carnosinase. There are two carnosinase homologues: serum secreted carnosinase and non-specific cytosolic dipeptidase, encoded by the genes CNDP1 and CNDP2 respectively and located on chromosome 18q22.3. Carnosine functions as a radical oxygen species scavenger and as a natural angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. Carnosine inhibits advanced glycation end product formation and reduces the synthesis of matrix proteins such as fibronectin and collagen type VI of podocytes and mesangial cells. In experimental studies it was shown that carnosine reduces the level of proinflammatory and profibrotic cytokines. It is suggested that carnosine is a naturally occurring anti-aging substance in human organisms with a beneficial effect on the cardiovascular system. This paper reports the results of studies concerning carnosine's role in kidney diseases, particularly in ischemia/reperfusion induced acute renal failure, diabetic nephropathy, gentamicin-induced nephrotoxicity and also in blood pressure regulation. The correlations between serum carnosine and serum carnosinase activity and polymorphism in the CNDP1 gene are analyzed. The role of CNDP1 gene polymorphism in the development of diabetic nephropathy and non-diabetic chronic kidney disease is discussed. Carnosine is engaged in different metabolic pathways. It has nephroprotective features. Further studies of carnosine metabolism and its biological properties, particularly those concerning the human organism, are required.",

Compared with controls, anti-VEGF-treated mice had similar aortic elastic modulus and histological appearance, but a marked increase in arterial elastance, indicating increased afterload, and elevated plasma angiotensin II. Increased afterload in treated mice led to concentric LV remodeling and reduced stroke volume without impaired LV contractility determined by LV peak change in pressure over time (dp/dt) and the end-systolic dimension-pressure relation. Anti-VEGF therapy did not alter MBF or MBV in skeletal muscle, myocardium, or kidney; but did produce cortical mesangial glomerulosclerosis. Ramipril therapy almost entirely prevented the adverse hemodynamic effects, increased afterload, and LV remodeling in anti-VEGF-treated mice.",

By contrast, inflammation and AGE accumulation associated with diabetes was not prevented. However, treatment with alagebrium in diabetic RAGE apoE KO mice reduced renal AGE levels and further reduced glomerular matrix accumulation. In addition, even in the absence of RAGE expression, alagebrium attenuated cortical inflammation, as denoted by the reduced expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, intracellular adhesion molecule-1, and the macrophage marker cluster of differentiation molecule 11b.

    "631": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is defined as either kidney damage or an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> for more than 3 months. Kidney damage is defined as pathological abnormalities or markers of damage, including abnormalities in blood or urine tests or imaging studies. CKD is classified as stage 1 to 5 on the basis of eGFR. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) carries a reciprocal risk of loss of kidney function in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and with the development of kidney disease. CVD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with CKD. Blood pressure control in patients with CKD aims to prevent CVD and provide renoprotection. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is involved in every stage of the progression of CKD and is, therefore, a critical link in the pathologic relationship between hypertension and renal disease. The first-line agents for controlling blood pressure are inhibitors of the RAS: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. These agents have been shown to have renoprotective effects in addition to their ability to control blood pressure. In CKD, the target blood pressure is less than 130/80 mm Hg, or 125/75 mm Hg, if amount of urinary protein is more than 1 g/day. To achieve the target blood pressure, other classes of antihypertensive agents, such as diuretics and calcium channel blockers, should be administered in addition to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers.", 
    "632": "We hypothesized that chronic administration of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, ramipril, to young adult male rats would prevent/ameliorate fractionated whole-brain irradiation-induced perirhinal cortex-dependent cognitive impairment. Eighty 12-14-week-old young adult male Fischer 344 rats received either: (1) sham irradiation, (2) 40 Gy of fractionated whole-brain irradiation delivered as two 5 Gy fractions/week for 4 weeks, (3) sham irradiation plus continuous administration of 15 mg/L of ramipril in the drinking water starting 3 days before irradiation, or (4) fractionated whole-brain irradiation plus ramipril. Cognitive function was assessed using a perirhinal cortex-dependent version of the novel object recognition task 26 weeks after irradiation. Microglial activation was determined in the perirhinal cortex and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus 28 weeks after irradiation using the ED1 antibody. Neurogenesis was assessed in the granular cell layer and subgranular zones of the dentate gyrus using a doublecortin antibody. Fractionated whole-brain irradiation led to: (1) a significant impairment in perirhinal cortex-dependent cognitive function, (2) a significant increase in activated microglia in the dentate gyrus but not in the perirhinal cortex, and (3) a significant decrease in neurogenesis. Continuous administration of ramipril before, during, and after irradiation prevented the fractionated whole-brain irradiation-induced changes in perirhinal cortex-dependent cognitive function, as well as in microglial activation in the dentate gyrus. Thus, as hypothesized, continuous administration of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, ramipril, can prevent the fractionated whole-brain irradiation-induced impairment in perirhinal cortex-dependent cognitive function.", 
    "633": "Although it is known that glomerular filtration rate (GFR) declines in response to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition, recent observations using GFR(CYSTATIN C) have shown a paradoxical increase calling into question its validity.

Adolescents with type 1 diabetes and hyperfiltration (n = 9, GFR(INULIN) \u2265 135 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) or normofiltration (n = 11) were studied during clamped euglycemia at baseline and after 3-week enalapril therapy.

Although GFR(CYSTATIN C) equations tended to underestimate while GFR(CREATININE) equations tended to overestimate baseline GFR(INULIN) in hyperfilterers, both approaches generally reflected declining GFR(INULIN) responses to enalapril. Normofilterers demonstrated a trend toward rising GFR(INULIN) in response to enalapril (112 \u00b1 16 mL/min/1.73\u00a0m(2) to 119 \u00b1 27 mL/min/1.73\u00a0m(2), P = .35). Although all estimating equations tended to overestimate baseline GFR(INULIN), they generally reflected the rising trend in GFR(INULIN) in response to enalapril in normofilterers. Although GFR(INULIN) declines in response to enalapril among hyperfilterers, we confirm the previous observation that it demonstrates a trend to rising among normofilterers. These group trends are both reflected by cystatin C- and creatinine-based estimates.",

    "638": "Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockade is currently the best-documented treatment strategy to delay the progression of chronic proteinuric nephropathies. Several large randomized controlled trials have shown the renoprotective potential of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) in nephropathies of almost any etiology. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists and the direct renin inhibitor aliskiren as add-on treatments to standard therapy including the optimal dose of ACEIs or ARBs reduce albuminuria or proteinuria and retard development of renal dysfunction more than placebo. No clinical evidence is available, however, about whether these strategies may influence long-term kidney disease outcomes. Combined RAAS blockade may be offered only to patients with proteinuric chronic nephropathies who do not achieve full and persistent remission of proteinuria with ACEI or ARB alone. They need to be carefully monitored for hyperkalemia and worsening of kidney function. This article reviews an evidence-based approach to use of RAAS-inhibiting agents in kidney diseases, considers combination RAAS blockade treatment strategies and discusses some perspectives related to the implementation of RAAS blockade in renal protection.",

Stroke is a disease of multifactorial aetiology that may develop as an end state in patients with serious vascular conditions--most notably, uncontrolled arterial hypertension--thereby necessitating the effective control of this risk factor to prevent stroke or its recurrence.

We examined the all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and hospitalizations for heart failure. A total of 12 studies with 11,259 participants were included in the analysis. Among the randomized clinical trials, with the use of RAS inhibitors over standard treatment, there was no improvement in all-cause mortality (RR: 0.99; 95% CI: 0.88-1.12; p = 0.88), while there was a trend toward lowered rates of hospitalization (RR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.86-1.01; p = 0.08).

In the majority of patients with ischaemic aetiology of HF, endothelial dysfunction is systemic in its nature and involves both arteries and veins, conductance vessels and microvascular beds, coronary, pulmonary, and peripheral vessels. The pattern of endothelial dysfunction is more heterogeneous in non-ischaemic HF, with fewer features of systemic abnormalities. Indeed, many subjects with non-ischaemic HF have a functionally preserved endothelium in peripheral arteries, with endothelial dysfunction seen only in coronary vessels. Endothelial dysfunction has significant prognostic value in HF, but its clinical application is hampered by methodological limitations in its assessment. Various medications (including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and statins) and regular physical activity have been shown to improve endothelial function in HF. However, there are still no pharmaceutical agents specifically targeting the vascular endothelium.

Renal disease (glomerulonephritis) is one of the most frequent and serious manifestations of SLE. Of the various histological types of lupus glomerulonephritis, diffuse proliferative nephritis carries the worst prognosis. Combined with high-dose prednisone, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) has emerged as a first-line immunosuppressive treatment, although data regarding the efficacy of MMF on the long-term preservation of renal function are forthcoming. Cyclophosphamide is reserved for more severe forms of lupus nephritis, such as crescentic glomerulonephritis with rapidly deteriorating renal function, patients with significant renal function impairment at presentation, and refractory renal disease. Evidence for the calcineurin inhibitors in the treatment of lupus nephritis is weaker, and it concerns patients who are intolerant or recalcitrant to other agents. While further controlled trials are mandatory, B cell modulation therapies, such as rituximab, belimumab and epratuzumab are confined to refractory disease.

This protocol is extended to include a sequential one-pot hydrosilylation. Using diphenylsilane as the appendage point, hydrosilylation of a protected allyl alcohol followed by hydrosilylation of an enamide generates a complex organosilane in one step.

    "692": "We explored the roles of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), angiotensin-(1-7), and Mas activation in angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockade-mediated attenuation of vascular remodeling. Vascular injury was induced by polyethylene-cuff placement around the mouse femoral artery. After cuff placement, the mRNA level of both ACE2 and Mas was markedly decreased in wild-type mice, whereas ACE mRNA was not changed. Immunostaining of ACE2 and Mas was observed mainly in the media and was reduced in the injured artery. Administration of angiotensin-(1-7) decreased neointimal formation after cuff placement, whereas administration of [D-Ala(7)] angiotensin-(1-7), a Mas antagonist, increased it. Consistent with these results, we also demonstrated that neointimal formation induced by cuff placement was further increased in ACE2 knockout mice. In angiotensin II type 1a receptor knockout mice, mRNA expression and immunostaining of ACE2 and Mas in the injured artery were greater, with less neointimal formation than in wild-type mice. Increased ACE2 expression in the injured artery was also observed by treatment of wild-type mice with an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker, olmesartan. These results suggested that activation of the ACE2-angiotensin-(1-7)-Mas axis is at least partly involved in the beneficial effects of angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockade on vascular remodeling.",

High incidence of metabolic syndrome, and lifestyle-related factors like obesity, high salt intake, and less physical activity may play important role in the pathophysiology of HTN. The association of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene polymorphism and low birth weight with blood pressure has been studied inadequately. Studies have found relationship between mass arsenic poisoning and HTN. Hypovitaminosis D presumably plays role in the aetiopathogenesis of HTN in Bangladeshi population. South Asians appear to respond to antihypertensive therapy in a similar manner to the Whites. The latest National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guideline advocates a calcium-channel blocker as step 1 antihypertensive treatment to people aged > 55 years and an ACE inhibitor or a low-cost angiotensin-II receptor blocker for the younger people. Calcium-channel blockers and beta-blockers have been found to be the most commonly prescribed antihypertensive drugs in Bangladesh. Non-adherence to the standard guidelines and irrational drug prescribing are likely to be important. On the other hand, non-adherence to antihypertensive treatment is quite high. At the advent of the new millennium, we are really unaware of our real situation. Large-scale, preferably, nation-wide survey and clinical research are needed to explore the different aspects of HTN in Bangladesh.",

    "695": "Aliskiren is the first known representative of a new class of non-peptide orally active renin inhibitors that blocks the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS) at its rate-limiting step. It induces a net reduction in plasma renin activity (PRA), angiotensin II and aldosterone levels. Aliskiren is effective in reducing blood pressure (BP) and is well tolerated. The incidence of adverse events and the number of study discontinuations as a result of adverse events during aliskiren treatment were relatively low and generally not dissimilar from placebo. In placebo-controlled studies, aliskiren showed a dose-related systolic/diastolic BP lowering effect at doses between 75 and 300 mg/day. When compared to active treatments, aliskiren was generally as effective as hydrochlorothiazide, angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and beta-blockers, in reducing BP. Aliskiren exhibits synergistic effects when combined with drugs that lead to a reactive increase in the PRA, such as diuretics, ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Although in clinical studies aliskiren proved to reduce proteinuria, the early termination of the Aliskiren Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Using Cardiovascular and Renal Disease Endpoints (ALTITUDE) confirms previous concerns about the full suppression of the RAAS, in this case with aliskiren combined with ACE-inhibitors or ARBs, in patients with diabetes and concomitant renal impairment.

Thus, there is a great need to exploit effective treatment strategies, and the carrier-drug approach is an attractive method to improve the kidney specificity of the therapeutic agents. The aim of this present study is to develop a peptide-drug conjugate for the kidney targeted delivery of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril (CAP), since G3-C12 peptide (ANTPCGPYTHDCPVKR) could specifically accumulate in the kidney after intravenous injection. Therefore, FITC labeled G3-C12 peptide (G3-C12-FITC) and peptide-drug conjugate (G3-C12-CAP) with a disulfide bond which can be cleaved by reduced glutathione in the kidney were prepared by solid-phase peptide synthesis. The fluorescence imaging of G3-C12-FITC revealed that the labeled peptide specifically accumulated in the kidney soon after i.v. injection to mice, and the accumulation is due largely to the reabsorption of the peptide by the proximal renal tubule cells. Furthermore, in comparison with the corresponding nonconjugated form, a 2.7-fold increase in renal area under concentration-time curve produced by the conjugate was observed in mice. Interestingly, the CAP entirely released in the kidney even at 0.05 h postinjection through disulfide reduction. As a consequence, the in vivo renal ACE inhibition was significantly increased. In conclusion, these findings suggest the potential of G3-C12 peptide serving as a suitable candidate carrier for kidney-targeted drug delivery.",

The triggering effect of AOPP-albumin was 100-times stronger than that of unmodified albumin. The effect of AOPP-albumin was mainly mediated by a CD36-dependent, redox-sensitive signaling involving activation of protein kinase C\u03b1, NADPH oxidase, and nuclear factor-\u03baB/activation protein-1. Chronic AOPP-albumin loading in unilateral nephrectomy rats resulted in deposition of AOPPs in renal tubular cells accompanied with local RAS activation and functional perturbations such as increase in urinary albumin excretion. Accumulation of AOPPs was also detected in human renal tubular cells and correlated with expression of angiotensin II in renal biopsies from 19 patients with IgA nephropathy.",

Certain combinations, such as a calcium channel blocker and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, have been associated with similar or fewer adverse effects and better outcomes than other combinations. In contrast, other combinations such as thiazide diuretics and \u03b2-blockers may cause more adverse effects than monotherapy. When choosing a thiazide diuretic, chlorthalidone is preferable to hydrochlorothiazide, given better efficacy and cardiovascular outcomes.

Various biochemical, cardiac, and hemodynamic parameters were measured at the end of 8 weeks of treatment in diabetes model and 10 d in hypertrophy model. STZ produced hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia, hypertension, bradycardia, increased creatinine kinase (CK-MB), lactate dehydrogenase enzymes (LDH) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, cardiac hypertrophy, and oxidative stress. Chronic treatment with perindopril significantly prevented STZ-induced hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia and controlled dyslipdemia in diabetic rats. Further, perindopril produced a significant reduction in elevated levels of CRP, LDH, and CK. STZ-induced hypertension and bradycardia were also prevented by perindopril treatment. Perindopril also produced beneficial effect by preventing cardiac hypertrophy as evident from cardiac hypertrophy index and left ventricular hypertrophic index. Perindopril also prevented STZ-induced oxidative stress. Similar results were obtained in ISO-induced cardiac hypertrophic model, which confirms the beneficial role of perindopril in cardiac hypertrophy. In conclusion, our data from both studies suggest that perindopril produced beneficial effect on cardiac complications.", 
    "725": "We tested the hypothesis that asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) interferes with other mechanisms in addition to inhibition of nitric oxide synthase (NOS). Thus, in skeletal muscle arterioles, in the presence of ADMA, we investigated the dilator effect of an NO donor and increases in flow and aimed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms, including the role of oxidative stress, which is known to reduce the bioavailability of NO.", 
    "726": "In isolated rat gracilis skeletal muscle arterioles (\u223c160 \u00b5m at 80 mm Hg), ADMA (similarly to pyrogallol) reduced dilations to sodium nitroprusside (SNP), which was significantly prevented by the presence of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT): SNP 10(-8)M; control: 43.2 \u00b1 3%, ADMA: 4.9 \u00b1 1%, ADMA + SOD/CAT: 30.2 \u00b1 9% (p < 0.05). Also, ADMA reduced basal diameter and flow-induced dilations, which were not restored by L-arginine, but prevented by SOD/CAT and by inhibition of NAD(P)H oxidase (but not xanthine oxidase) and by an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin type 1 receptor blocker (ARB). ADMA increased the production of reactive oxygen species detected by lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence, which was significantly inhibited by SNP or ARB.", 
    "727": "We suggest that by activating the vascular renin-angiotensin-NAD(P)H oxidase pathway, ADMA elicits oxidative stress, which interferes with the bioavailability of NO and consequently reduces NO-mediated dilations.", 
    "728": "Diabetic nephropathy is a complication of diabetes mellitus leading to end-stage renal disease. Oxidative stress and inflammation play a major role in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy. Green tea, known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, has been shown to be renoprotective. We hypothesized that (+)-catechin (CTN), a component of green tea, is responsible for the renoprotection. Our investigation of the therapeutic potential of CTN in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats demonstrated for the first time that the effects of CTN treatment were comparable with the effects of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) enalapril for the treatment of albumin excretion. After 12 weeks of CTN treatment with 35 mg/d in the drinking water, urinary albumin excretion and plasma creatinine concentrations in all the diabetic treatment groups were reduced, compared with the diabetic group with no treatment. Urine creatinine and creatinine clearance were higher in diabetic groups treated with CTN and ACEi compared with the diabetic group with no treatment. Endothelin 1, lipid peroxidation, concentration of alanine transferase enzyme, and expression of fibronectin were lower in all the treatment groups compared with the diabetic group with no treatment. Concentrations of free thiols were higher in the CTN-treated group compared with the diabetic rats with no treatment. Our findings suggest that CTN has renoprotective properties comparable with ACEi, and coadministration of CTN and enalapril might be useful in reducing albumin excretion as well as improving endothelial function. (+)-Catechin might be successfully used in the future for clinical situations where ACEi is poorly tolerated or contraindicated.", 
    "729": "The standard of care in patients with glioblastoma (GBM) relies on surgical resection, radiation therapy (RT), and temozolomide. Steroids are required in almost all patients to reduce peritumoral edema, but are associated with numerous side effects. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a key driver of peritumoral edema and angiogenesis in human GBM. Recently, angiotensin-II inhibitors were reported to reduce VEGF secretion and tumor growth in some animal models.", 
    "730": "To investigate whether angiotensin-II inhibitors might have a similar effect in humans and before undertaking a prospective study, we retrospectively investigated a series of 87 consecutive, newly diagnosed GBM patients, treated in a single center. Amongst these patients, 29 (33%) were already treated before RT for high blood pressure (HBP), 18 of them (21%) with an angiotensin-II inhibitor. In all patients, performance status, surgical procedures, and steroid dosages were documented.", 
    "731": "Patients treated with angiotensin-II inhibitors, but not other antihypertensive drugs, required half of the steroids of the other patients during radiotherapy (P = 0.005 in multivariate analysis, considering other antihypertensive treatments, surgical resection, and performance status). This effect of angiotensin-II inhibitors was also significant at the beginning of radiotherapy (P = 0.03 in multivariate analysis). Treatment with angiotensin-II inhibitors had no effect on survival (16.2 vs. 17.9 months for the treated and the non-treated group, respectively, P = 0.77).",

    "733": "Angioedema indicates acute subcutaneous edema that characterizes improperly restricted cutaneous or mucous membrane swelling, which can occur only once or be relapsing. Edema usually occurs in the periorbital area, lips, tongue, extremities and intestinal wall. It has turned out that angioedema is usually caused by the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE) or allergies to certain allergens (allergic or IgE-mediated angioedema), followed by C1 inhibitor deficiency (hereditary and acquired angioedema), or the cause is unknown (idiopathic angioedema). It has been shown that patients with angioedema often have urticaria, which is noted in approximately 50% of cases. Usually there is a type I allergic reaction to some food allergens or drugs or insect stings. The most common causes of allergic angioedema are bee and wasp stings, reactions to medications or injections for sensitivity testing, and certain foods (especially eggs, shellfish and nuts). In diagnostic terms, it is important to determine the potential allergen, which is commonly performed with cutaneous tests, such as prick test, etc. The main risk of angioedema is swelling of the tongue, larynx and trachea, which can lead to airway obstruction and death, therefore tracheotomy is indicated in such cases. The initial treatment of patients with most forms of angioedema included administration of antihistamines and glucocorticoids, while epinephrine is given if there is fear from laryngeal edema.",

    "736": "Among the 2,013 patients for whom medication monitoring was recommended, 42% were overdue for monitoring at some point during the study. As the number of index medications the patient was prescribed increased, the likelihood of ever being overdue for monitoring decreased. Being listed on the provider-specific monitoring bulletin doubled the odds of a patient receiving recommended laboratory monitoring before the next measurement period (1-2 months). Limiting the intervention to the most overdue patients, however, mitigated its overall impact.", 
    "737": "Recommended laboratory monitoring of chronic medications appears to be inconsistent in primary care, resulting in potential harm for individuals at risk for medication-related toxicity. EHRs may be an important component of systems designed to improve medication monitoring, but multimodal interventions will likely be needed to achieve high reliability.", 
    "738": "A particularly dangerous condition in pregnant women is already dilated left ventricle with severe functional impairment. Taking as an example the case of woman with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) first diagnosed in 17th week of pregnancy, the paper discusses diagnostic, therapeutic challenges and management of heart failure during pregnancy. Repeat measurements of brain natiuretic peptide levels should be helpful in diagnosing heart failure. To distinguish DCM from peripartum cardiomyopathy the time of manifestation should be considered. The risk of serious events is associated with NYHA class and impairment of left ventricular ejection fraction. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) and angiotensin-II receptor blockers are contraindicated in pregnancy because of fetal toxicity. The incidence of sight effects is associated with time of administration of ACE-I and duration of treatment. Possible sight effects of drugs in fetus should be monitored (mainly ultrasonographically). ICD can be implanted during pregnancy if indicated. To assess the time and mode of delivery, a multidisciplinary team of different specialists is required. Subsequent pregnancy is contraindicated in a patient with DCM and low ejection fraction of left ventricle.", 
    "739": "Dietary salt intake is a major determinant of the activation state of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Given the important role of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in plaque accumulation, we investigated its role in the development of atherogenesis associated with sodium intake in apolipoprotein E knockout mice. Six-weeks of a low-salt diet (containing 0.03% sodium) resulted in a 4-fold increase in plaque accumulation in apolipoprotein E knockout mice when compared with mice receiving normal chow (containing 0.30% sodium). This was associated with activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, increased vascular expression of adhesion molecules and inflammatory cytokines, and increased adhesion of labeled leukocytes across the whole aorta on a dynamic flow assay. These changes were blocked with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril (2 mg/kg per day). A high-salt diet (containing 3% sodium) attenuated vascular inflammation and atherogenesis, associated with suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, although systolic blood pressure levels were modestly increased (5 \u00b1 1 mmHg). Constitutive activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 apolipoprotein E knockout mice was also associated with increased atherosclerosis and vascular adhesion, and this was attenuated by a high-salt diet associated with suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. By contrast, a low-salt diet failed to further activate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system or to increase atherosclerosis in angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 apolipoprotein E knockout mice. Together, these data validate a relationship between salt-mediated renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activation and atherogenesis, which may partly explain the inconclusive or paradoxical findings of recent observational studies, despite clear effects on blood pressure.",

The study group was comprised of 40 patients treated with equator, and the control group included 20 patients receiving metoprolol and enalapril (12.5 mg and 10 mg respectively). In the beginning and the end of the study (total duration 6 months), all the patients underwent a comprehensive clinical and instrumental examination that included evaluation of their general clinical condition, 24-hour arterial blood pressure monitoring (BPM), electrocardiography (ECG), and doppleroechocardiography. It was shown that therapy with equator significantly decreased systolic and diastolic arterial pressure (SAP and DAP). Comparative analysis of the results of repeated doppleroechocardiography revealed the improvement of left ventricular diastolic function in the majority of the patients of group 1 (83%). It is concluded that systematic treatment with equator produces a stable hypotensive effect and normalizes circadian rhythms of arterial pressure. Moreover, adequate antihypertensive therapy improves diastolic left ventricular function. Treatment with equator is well tolerated by the patients and causes no serious adverse effects.",

Rabbits in the control and treated groups were subjected to 3, 10 and 21 days of complete ureteric ligation and then killed humanely. The control and treated groups were evaluated at baseline and at the end of the experiment, by measuring split effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) using diuretic renography, and the split glomerular filtration rate (GFR) using selective creatinine clearance. Renal histopathology was evaluated using a tubulo-interstitial damage score.", 
    "743": "In the sham group there was no significant effect on any of the evaluated variables. For split ERPF, losartan showed the highest renoprotective effect, saving 44% and 77% of ERPF at 3 and 21 days after UUO, respectively. Losartan was also the best renoprotective agent for GFR. For renal histopathology, enalapril showed the earliest and greatest improvement as assessed by the damage score, reaching 60% at 21 days after UUO. l-Arginine was the next best effect to blockade the renin-angiotensin system for renoprotection.",

The study was performed on Fisher 344 rats underwent 8-day treatment with diethylstilboestrol (DES). The proliferation index (PCNA) and VEGF expression in pituitary sections were estimated using immunohistochemical methods. Treatment with DES increased the number of PCNA-positive cells, VEGF-positive cells, and VEGF-positive blood vessels in pituitary. Stimulatory effect of estrogen on cell proliferation and VEGF expression in blood vessels was attenuated by losartan, PD123319, and captopril. VEGF immunoreactivity in pituitary cells of DES-treated rats was decreased by AT1 antagonist and not changed by AT2 blocker and ACE inhibitor. Our findings suggest the involvement of RAS in DES-induced cell proliferation and VEGF expression in pituitary. Both the AT1 and AT2 receptors appear to mediate the estrogen-dependent mitogenic and proangiogenic effects in rat pituitary.", 
    "746": "Diabetes mellitus is rapidly becoming a global health issue that may overtake cancer during the next two decades as it covertly affects multiple organ systems that goes undiagnosed long after the onset. A number of complications are associated with poorly controlled hyperglycemia. Diabetic nephropathy is one of the most common complications of diabetes mellitus. Other than angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) there is not much in the armamentarium with which to treat patients with overt diabetic nephropathy. Research points towards a multifactorial etiology and complex interplay of several pathogenic pathways that can contribute to the declining kidney function in diabetes. Patients with diabetic nephropathy (and with any chronic kidney disease) eventually develop kidney fibrosis. Despite the financial and labor investment spent on determining the basic mechanism of fibrosis, not much progress has been made in terms of therapeutic targets available to us today. This may be in part due to paucity in the experimental animal models available. However, there now seems to be a concerted effort from several pharmaceutical companies to develop a drug that would halt/delay the process of fibrosis, if not reverse it. This review discusses the current state of research in the field while staying within the context of diabetic nephropathy.",

Prescription rates rose with age but already 25% of the population aged between 41 and 60 years were treated. More than 50% of the Belgians above 60 years took antihypertensive medication. From 1997 to 2009, a rise in absolute prescription rate was observed for all antihypertensive drug classes. Diuretics and beta blockers remain by far the most frequently delivered drugs with stable prescription rates of 30% over this period. The largest rise is observed for angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), which were only sporadically prescribed in 1997 and now account for 10.5% of the delivered antihypertensive drugs. A small rise is also noted for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-inhibitors) (12.3% in 1997 vs 15.6% in 2009). Their success comes at the expense of calcium antagonists, of which the delivered amount declined from 19.8% in 1997 tot 14.1% in 2009. A progressive rise in the prescription of fixed combination products is observed (from 15% in 1997 to 21% in 2009), and can probably be attributed to their growing availability but also to the recent guidelines, promoting their usage.",

The aim of the present study was to investigate possible mechanisms underlying the muscle-protective effects of enalapril. We also sought to discern the effects of enalapril mediated by nitric oxide (NO) from those independent of this signaling molecule. Eighty-seven male Fischer 344\u2009\u00d7\u2009Brown Norway rats were randomly assigned to receive enalapril (n\u2009=\u200923), the NO synthase (NOS) inhibitor N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; n\u2009=\u200922), enalapril + L-NAME (n\u2009=\u200919), or placebo (n\u2009=\u200923) from 24 to 27 months of age. Experiments were performed on the tibialis anterior muscle. Total NOS activity and the expression of neuronal, endothelial, and inducible NOS isoforms (nNOS, eNOS, and iNOS) were determined to investigate the effects of enalapril on NO signaling. Transcript levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1\u03b1) were assessed to explore actions of enalapril on inflammation and mitochondrial biogenesis, respectively. Protein expression of energy-sensing and insulin signaling mediators, including protein kinase B (Akt-1), phosphorylated Akt-1 (pAkt-1), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), AMP-activated protein kinase subunit alpha (AMPK\u03b1), phosphorylated AMPK\u03b1 (pAMPK\u03b1), and the glucose transporter GLUT-4, was also determined. Finally, the generation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was quantified in subsarcolemmal (SSM) and intermyofibrillar (IFM) mitochondria. Enalapril increased total NOS activity, which was prevented by L-NAME co-administration. eNOS protein content was enhanced by enalapril, but not by enalapril + L-NAME. Gene expression of iNOS was down-regulated by enalapril either alone or in combination with L-NAME. In contrast, protein levels of nNOS were unaltered by treatments. The mRNA abundance of TNF-\u03b1 was reduced by enalapril relative to placebo, with no differences among any other group. PCG-1\u03b1 gene expression was unaffected by enalapril and lowered by enalapril + L-NAME. No differences in protein expression of Akt-1, pAkt-1, AMPK\u03b1, pAMPK\u03b1, or GLUT-4 were detected among groups. However, mTOR protein levels were increased by enalapril compared with placebo. Finally, all treatment groups displayed reduced SSM, but not IFM H2O2 production relative to placebo. Our data indicate that enalapril induces a number of metabolic adaptations in aged skeletal muscle. These effects result from the concerted modulation of NO and angiotensin II signaling, rather than from a dichotomous action of enalapril on the two pathways. Muscle protection by enalapril administered late in life appears to be primarily mediated by mitigation of oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory signaling.",

    "767": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is a zinc metallopeptidase containing two homologous domains. While the C-domain plays a major role in blood pressure regulation, the N-domain hydrolyzes the antifibrotic agent N-acetyl-Ser-Asp-Lys-Pro. Thus, N-domain selective (N-selective) inhibitors could be useful in the treatment of conditions relating to excessive tissue fibrosis. New keto-ACE analogues were designed that contained functionalities considered important for N-selective inhibitor RXP407 binding, namely, a P(2) Asp, N-acetyl group, and C-terminal amide. Such functionalities were incorporated to assess the structural determinants for N-selective binding in a novel inhibitor template. Inhibitors containing a C-terminal amide and modified P(2)' group were poor inhibitors of the N-domain, with several of these displaying improved inhibition of the C-domain. Molecules with both a C-terminal amide and P(2) Asp were also poor inhibitors and not N-selective. Compounds containing a free C-terminus, a P(2) Asp and protecting group displayed a change of more than 1000-fold N-selectivity compared with the parent molecule. Molecular docking models revealed interaction of these P(2) groups with S(2) residues Tyr369 and Arg381. This study emphasizes the importance of P(2) functionalities in allowing for improved N-selective binding and provides further rationale for the design of N-selective inhibitors, which could be useful in treating tissue fibrosis.",

    "773": "Obesity increases oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, and inflammation, but the effect of obesity on postoperative AKI is not known. We examined the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and AKI in 445 patients undergoing cardiac surgery and whether oxidative stress (F(2)-isoprostanes), inflammation (IL-6), or antifibrinolysis (plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 [PAI-1]) contribute to any identified relationship. Overall, 112 (25%) of the 445 patients developed AKI. Higher BMI was independently associated with increased odds of AKI (26.5% increase per 5 kg/m(2) [95% confidence interval, 4.3%-53.4%]; P=0.02). Baseline F(2)-isoprostane (P=0.04), intraoperative F(2)-isoprostane (P=0.003), and intraoperative PAI-1 (P=0.04) concentrations also independently predicted AKI. BMI no longer predicted AKI after adjustment for the effect of F(2)-isoprostanes, suggesting that obesity may affect AKI via effects on oxidative stress. In contrast, adjustment for IL-6 or PAI-1 did not substantially alter the association between BMI and AKI. Further, deconstruction of the obesity-AKI relationship into direct (i.e., independent of candidate pathways) and indirect (i.e., effect of BMI on AKI via each candidate pathway) effects indicated that F(2)-isoprostanes, but not IL-6 or PAI-1, partially mediate the relationship between obesity and AKI (P=0.001). In conclusion, obesity independently predicts AKI after cardiac surgery, and oxidative stress may partially mediate this association.",

    "779": "Antihypertensive treatment may reduce prolonged QT duration in hypertension. Generally, the reductions of blood pressure and/or of cardiac mass are believed to be the responsible factors. However, drugs are not equivalent in QT modulation despite similar antihypertensive and antihypertrophic action. We investigated the effect of a calcium channel blocker, lacidipine and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril on QT duration in rats. Normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were treated with lacidipine (at the dose of 1.5 mg/kg per day for WKY and 3 mg/kg per day for SHR) or enalapril (5 mg/kg per day for WKY and 10 mg/kg per day for SHR) during 8 weeks. Tail-cuff systolic blood pressure (sBP), left ventricular weight (LVW), vascular function of isolated aorta and mesenteric artery and duration of QT (and QTc) interval on Frank electrocardiograms were evaluated. As expected, untreated SHR showed elevated sBP, impaired vascular reactivity, increased LVW and prolonged QT when compared with WKY (p < 0.05). After treatment, both agents markedly improved vascular reactivity and reduced sBP in SHR (p < 0.05). Additionally, enalapril reduced LVW in both hypertensive (by 17%; p < 0.05) and normotensive rats (by 13%; p < 0.05) and, consequently, corrected QT duration in SHR. Interestingly, lacidipine also reduced LVW in SHR (by 9%; p < 0.05), but without influence on prolonged QT. Moreover, lacidipine had no effect on LVW in WKYs but prolonged their QT interval (by 10%; p < 0.05). In conclusion, lacidipine did not reverse a progressive prolongation of QT in SHR, despite sBP lowering and LVW reduction. Thus, the lowering of blood pressure and/or reduction of LVW are not sufficient per se to normalize ventricular repolarization in hypertensive cardiac disease. More likely, modulation of QT prolongation by antihypertensive drugs is a function of their complex action on blood pressure, vascular function, cardiac mass and on reflex neurohumoral activation.", 
    "780": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI's) are an important medication in the treatment of congestive heart failure. However, ACEIs may cause harmful side effects, such as the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), which is a rare but important side effect. We describe here a case of SIADH associated with ACEI administration in a 6-year-old boy with restrictive cardiomyopathy. After recovery from acute exacerbation of congestive heart failure by tolvaptan administration, an ACEI (cilazapril) was started to decrease the production of angiotensin II, which upregulates serum antidiuretic hormone secretion. The patient's heart failure symptoms worsened, including accumulation of right pleural effusion and ascites, after the initiation of ACEI administration. Cessation of ACEI administration dramatically improved his symptoms. Because it is difficult to distinguish SIADH associated with ACEI from worsening congestive heart failure, the possibility of fluid retention due to ACEI administration should always be considered when this agent is administered to patients with heart failure.", 
    "781": "The natural history of diabetic nephropathy was defined in the 1980s on the basis of longitudinal studies undertaken in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. However, an increasing number of studies have indicated that certain diabetic patients do not present with the same evolution as was then defined: for example, some often have significant initial deterioration of glomerular filtration rate whereas, in others, microalbuminuria is reduced spontaneously. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) may be accompanied, rather than preceded, by macroalbuminuria, or it may develop in patients with microalbuminuria or even in those with albuminuria levels that revert to normal. CKD can also develop in patients whose albuminuria levels remain normal. Progression to macroalbuminuria is, in fact, less frequent than regression to normoalbuminuria or no change in microalbuminuria status in diabetic patients with microalbuminuria, especially in type 1 diabetes. Some experience progressive deterioration of renal function due to diabetes without developing significant proteinuria: this is seen fairly frequently and can affect 50% of patients with renal insufficiency. Such cases are more often older patients treated with renin-angiotensin system blockers who usually have a history of cardiovascular disease. Evolution to end-stage renal disease is slower in this subgroup of patients, although histological analyses may show surprisingly advanced glomerular lesions. The main parameters of surveillance remain regular monitoring of glycaemia, and control of blood pressure and the evolution of initial albuminuria levels. Nevertheless, why some patients exhibit conventional diabetic nephropathy while others have slower declines in renal function associated with normal albuminuria levels or microalbuminuria is unclear. It is hoped that the new pathological classification of diabetic nephropathy will help in our understanding of these discrepancies.", 
    "782": "Cardiotoxicity (CTX) is a serious adverse effect of anticancer drugs that impacts on quality of life and overall survival of cancer patients. Hypokinetic cardiomyopathy is the most typical form of CTX, and it is traditionally considered refractory to therapy. Prevention of CTX remains of paramount importance, and several measures, including serial cardiac function monitoring, reduction of cumulative anthracycline dose, use of anthracycline analogues and cardioprotective agents, have been proposed. Over the last decade, however, a new approach based on cardiac biomarkers has emerged as an effective alternative strategy for the early detection of subclinical cardiac injury. In particular, the role of troponin I in identifying patients at risk of CTX as well as of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in preventing left ventricular dysfunction and late cardiac events in high-risk patients, namely those with raised troponin I levels after chemotherapy, has been consistently demonstrated as an effective tool for CTX prevention.",

It is performed on the Agilent 6410 LC-MS/MS under the multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) mode with electrospray ionization. Gliclazide was used as the internal standard (IS). Analytes and IS were extracted from plasma by solid-phase extraction. The reconstituted samples were chromatographed on a Diamond C\u2081\u2088(150 mm \u00d7 4.6 mm, 5 \u03bcm) column. The mobile phase was composed of 0.1% acetic acid-acetonitrile (50:50, v/v), with gradient flow rates: 0.6 mL/min (0-4.55 min); 4.55-4.65 min, 1 mL/min; 1 mL/min (4.65-9.5 min); 9.5-9.6 min, 0.6 mL/min; 0.6 mL/min (9.6-10 min). Method validation demonstrated that the method was of satisfactory specificity, sensitivity, precision and accuracy in linear ranges of 1-2000 ng/mL for lercanidipine, 1-2000 ng/mL for benazepril and 1-1600 ng/mL for benazeprilat, respectively. The precision (RSD%) was better than 15, and the lower limit of quantitation was identifiable and reproducible at 1 ng/mL for the three analytes. The plasma samples were stable after being stored for more than 60 days and after two freeze-thaw cycles (-20 to -25 \u00b0C).

We conducted a prospective, open-label study of 67 patients with CKD who were already being treated with other antihypertensives. Inclusion criteria were blood pressure (BP) \u2265130/80 mmHg, albuminuria \u226530 mg/g, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) >30 ml/min/1.73 m(2). Subjects were treated with 150 mg/day aliskiren, which was increased to 300 mg/day for the 24-week study period. Aliskiren effectively reduced both systolic and diastolic BP, plasma renin activity (PRA), serum aldosterone concentration, albuminuria, urinary N-acetyl-glucosaminidase, and urinary \u03b22-microglobulin levels. Although eGFR was significantly decreased after 4 weeks of aliskiren treatment, it recovered to a pretreatment level within 12 weeks of treatment initiation. There were no significant differences in the percent reduction of albuminuria or changes of eGFR levels when the subjects were divided into three groups on the basis of baseline eGFR (stages 1/2, 3, and 4) and the presence or absence of diabetes mellitus (DM group and non-DM group). Furthermore, in patients not treated with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS) inhibitors, including angiotensin receptor blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors at baseline, changes in eGFR were significantly increased compared with those already treated with RAAS inhibitors at baseline.

    "792": "The prevalence of proteinuria at 1\u2003year after renal transplantation ranges between 11% and 45% and is even higher in patients treated with inhibitors of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Two main mechanisms can lead to proteinuria: an inadequate reabsorption of small proteins from proximal tubular cells damaged by ischemia-reperfusion injury, rejection, or toxic agents (tubular proteinuria) or an increased passage of albumin and/or protein with higher molecular weight (MW) because of a disruption of glomerular barrier caused by recurrent or de novo glomerulonephritis, transplant glomerulopathy, chronic rejection, or CNI toxicity (glomerular proteinuria). Proteinuric patients have worse patient and graft survival rates in comparison to non proteinuric patients. The amount of proteinuria is a reliable predictor of the allograft outcome. However, even microalbuminuria may be associated with a poor outcome. Treatment of proteinuria mainly rests on the management of the etiologic cause. Inhibitors of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) are useful in reversing microalbuminuria and can reduce proteinuria, but their efficacy in interfering with patient or graft survival is not demonstrated.",

However, differences exist in their underlying pathophysiology (IgE mediated vs. pseudoallergic). Blockers of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system are the most common class of medications associated with isolated AE and are most probably related to elevated bradykinin levels. Typically, ACE inhibitor-associated AE can occur up to several years after initiating treatment, and may sporadically recur even after discontinuation. A comprehensive investigation of AE must include analysis of complement factors, tryptase levels as well as specific allergy tests. Furthermore, other possible causative agents ought to be excluded. Every patient with drug-induced AE must receive an allergy pass as well as emergency medication including epinephrine.

Diabetic nephropathy, also called diabetic kidney disease, is associated with significant macrovascular risk, and is the leading cause of kidney failure in the United States. Diabetic nephropathy usually manifests after 10 years' duration of type 1 diabetes, but may be present at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. Screening for microalbuminuria should be initiated five years after diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. Screening for microalbuminuria with a spot urine albumin/creatinine ratio identifies the early stages of nephropathy. Positive results on two of three tests (30 to 300 mg of albumin per g of creatinine) in a six-month period meet the diagnostic criteria for diabetic nephropathy. Because diabetic nephropathy may also manifest as a decreased glomerular filtration rate or an increased serum creatinine level, these tests should be included in annual monitoring. Preventive measures include using an angiotensin- converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker in normotensive persons. Optimizing glycemic control and using an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker to control blood pressure slow the progression of diabetic nephropathy, but implementing intensive glycemic and blood pressure control is associated with more adverse outcomes. Low-protein diets may also decrease adverse renal outcomes and mortality in persons with diabetic nephropathy.",

During the past several decades, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) activation has emerged as an important factor in the pathophysiology of endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) have well-established efficacy for treating CVD, but their use may be limited by intolerable side effects, such as cough and angioedema.

    "806": "The sympathetic nervous system, leptin, and renin-angiotensin system (RAS) have been implicated in obesity-associated hypertension. There is increasing evidence for the presence of both leptin and angiotensin II receptors in several key brain cardiovascular and metabolic control regions. We tested the hypothesis that the brain RAS plays a facilitatory role in the sympathetic nerve responses to leptin. In rats, intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of losartan (5 \u03bcg) selectively inhibited increases in renal and brown adipose tissue (BAT) sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) produced by leptin (10 \u03bcg ICV) but did not reduce the SNA responses to corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF) or the melanocortin receptor agonist MTII. In mice with deletion of angiotensin II type-1a receptors (AT(1a)R(-/-)), increases in renal and BAT SNA induced by leptin (2 \u03bcg ICV) were impaired whereas SNA responses to MTII were preserved. Decreases in food intake and body weight with ICV leptin did not differ in AT(1a)R(-/-) vs. AT(1a)R(+/+) mice. ICV leptin in rats increased AT(1a)R and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) mRNA in the subfornical organ and AT(1a)R mRNA in the arcuate nucleus, suggesting leptin-induced upregulation of the brain RAS in specific brain regions. To evaluate the role of de novo production of brain angiotensin II in SNA responses to leptin, we treated rats with captopril (12.5 \u03bcg ICV). Captopril attenuated leptin effects on renal and BAT SNA. In conclusion, these studies provide evidence that the brain RAS selectively facilitates renal and BAT sympathetic nerve responses to leptin while sparing effects on food intake.",

Based on the sequence of an ACE-inhibitory hexapeptide (TPTQQS) purified from yeast, enzyme kinetics experiments, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and a docking simulation were performed. The hexapeptide was found to inhibit ACE in a non-competitive manner, as supported by the structural model. The hexapeptide bound to ACE via interactions of the N-terminal Thr1, Thr3, and Gln4 residues with the residues on the lid structure of ACE, and the C-terminal Ser6 attracted the zinc ion, which is vital for ACE catalysis. The displacement of the zinc ion from the active site resulted in the inhibition of ACE activity.

Use of these medications, hormones, vitamins, and dietary products is based on their ability to alter the pathophysiology of continued aortic wall growth. In this review, the explanation of how these medications can achieve suppression of abdominal aortic aneurysm is explained in relation to their effect on the various aspects of aortic wall inflammation. Despite the large number of animal and observational studies, there remain very few randomized clinical trials to support use of any of these agents. However, there may be sufficient evidence to suggest that statins, doxycycline, vitamin E, cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin II receptor blockers can prove beneficial in some individuals.", 
    "818": "A rapid, linear (over a concentration range of 0.00012-0.0012% and with correlation coefficient r = 0.999), accurate (an average recovery of 100%), precise (an average standard deviation < 1.5%) and economical first derivative UV spectrophotometric assay method (lambda(max) = 238 nm) was developed for the determination of moexipril hydrochloride (MOXL) in a pharmaceutical formulation. The method was investigated for its utility for the determination of MOXL in commercially available tablets and as a stability-indicative assay in solid state. The results obtained by means of the investigated method were statistically compared (t-Student test and F-Snedecor test) with the results obtained by means of the reference method--HPLC, which evidenced that both methods are equally precise and accurate. It was finally concluded that first derivative UV spectrophotometry is selective with reference to excipients used for the tablets' formulation, however, it is not selective with reference to MOXL degradation products.",

Serial anthropometric parameters recorded from birth to the latest follow-up (mean 12.5 \u00b1 6.1 years) and at each intervention [neonatal surgery, bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis (BCPA), TCPC, catheter treatment] were converted to z-scores. The influence of saturation, heart failure treatment and surgery intervals on growth was determined.",

Z-scores did not change significantly after the TCPC. Younger age at the BCPA had a positive influence on the weight z-score at the TCPC (P < 0.05); somatic growth at the latest follow-up (FU) was negatively influenced by heart failure treatment (P < 0.05).", 
    "822": "Body growth is severely impaired in Fontan patients. A close interstage follow-up between the first surgery and the BCPA must be targeted at optimizing nutritional support to counter the important growth retardation occurring before the BCPA. The better catch-up growth at the TCPC when the BCPA is performed earlier in life supports the current trend to perform the BCPA at a younger age. Heart failure treatment after a Fontan completion is independently associated with decreased late somatic development.", 
    "823": "Telmisartan provides renal benefit at all stages of the renal continuum in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. This research is to investigate the effect of telmisartan on kidney function in diabetic rats and to identify the underlying molecular mechanisms. Diabetic rats were divided into vehicle group, low dosage (TeL) group, and high dosage of telmisartan (TeH) group. We performed Illumina RatRef-12 Expression BeadChip gene array experiments. We found 3-months of treatment with telmisartan significantly decreased 24-h urinary albumin, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and increased creatinine clearance rate. Kidney hypertrophy and glomerular mesangial matrix expansion were ameliorated. The glomeruli from the TeH group had 1541 genes with significantly changed expression (554 increased, 987 decreased). DAVID (Database for annotation, visualization and Integrated discovery) analyses showed that the most enriched term was 'mitochondrion' (Gene Ontology (GO:0005739)) in all 67 GO functional categories. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses indicated that all differentially expressed genes included seven KEGG pathways. Of those pathways, four are closely related to the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. Quantitative real-time PCR verified that the H+ transporting mitochondrial F1 complex, beta subunit (Atp5b), cytochrome c oxidase subunit VIc (Cox6c), and NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) Fe-S protein 3 (Ndufs3) were significantly downregulated both in TeL and TeH groups, while nephrosis 1 homolog (Nphs1) and nephrosis 2 homolog (Nphs2) were significantly upregulated. The increased expression of malonaldehyde and NDUFS3 in the glomeruli of diabetic rats was attenuated by telmisartan. The other significantly changed pathway we found was the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway. Our data suggest that telmisartan can improve kidney function in diabetic rats. The mechanism may be involved in mitochondrion oxidative phosphorylation, the PPAR-\u03b3 pathway, and the slit diaphragm.",

    "829": "Cardiac excitation-contraction coupling (EC coupling) links the electrical excitation of the cell membrane to the mechanical contractile machinery of the heart. Calcium channels are major players of EC coupling and are regulated by voltage and Ca(2+)/calmodulin (CaM). CaM binds to the IQ motif located in the C terminus of the Ca(v)1.2 channel and induces Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation (CDI) and facilitation (CDF). Mutation of Ile to Glu (Ile1624Glu) in the IQ motif abolished regulation of the channel by CDI and CDF. Here, we addressed the physiological consequences of such a mutation in the heart. Murine hearts expressing the Ca(v)1.2(I1624E) mutation were generated in adult heterozygous mice through inactivation of the floxed WT Ca(v)1.2(L2) allele by tamoxifen-induced cardiac-specific activation of the MerCreMer Cre recombinase. Within 10 days after the first tamoxifen injection these mice developed dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) accompanied by apoptosis of cardiac myocytes (CM) and fibrosis. In Ca(v)1.2(I1624E) hearts, the activity of phospho-CaM kinase II and phospho-MAPK was increased. CMs expressed reduced levels of Ca(v)1.2(I1624E) channel protein and I(Ca). The Ca(v)1.2(I1624E) channel showed \"CDI\" kinetics. Despite a lower sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) content, cellular contractility and global Ca(2+) transients remained unchanged because the EC coupling gain was up-regulated by an increased neuroendocrine activity. Treatment of mice with metoprolol and captopril reduced DCM in Ca(v)1.2(I1624E) hearts at day 10. We conclude that mutation of the IQ motif to IE leads to dilated cardiomyopathy and death.", 
    "830": "Renin has recently attracted much attention in the antihypertensive community, since this enzyme starts the angiotensin-converting cascade and forms the rate-limiting step in this cascade. In the present study, we describe a new method called active-site spatial partitioning (ASSP) for quantitatively characterizing the nonbonding interaction profile between renin and the substructures of indole-3-carboxamide derivatives-a novel class of achiral renin inhibitors that exhibit both high affinity and strong specificity for renin, thus blocking its active state-on the basis of structural models of protein-ligand complexes. It is shown that the ASSP-derived potential parameters are highly correlated with the experimentally measured activities of indole-3-carboxamides; the statistical models linking the parameters and activities using a sophisticated partial least squares regression technique show much promise as an effective and powerful tool for generalizing and predicting the pharmaceutical potencies and the physicochemical properties of other modified derivatives. Furthermore, by visually examining substructure-color plots generated by the ASSP procedure, it is found that the relative importance of nonbonding contributions to the recognition and binding of a ligand by renin is as follows: steric < hydrophobic < electrostatic. The polar and charged moieties that float on the surface of the ligand molecule play a critical role in conferring electrostatic stability and specificity to renin-ligand complexes, whereas the aromatic rings embedded in the core region of the ligand are the main source of hydrophobic and steric potentials that lead to substantial stabilization of the complex architecture.", 
    "831": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been implicated in pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary fibrosis. In the present study, we examined the effects of maternal exposure to captopril (2.85 mg/kg/day) during late pregnancy (G13-G21) on postnatal rat lung development. Treatment with captopril during late pregnancy caused a significant decrease in ACE activity in P0 rats. Body weight decreased at P0 (p<0.001), P8 and P15 (p<0.01) in captopril-treated rats. Lung weight of P0 and P8 pups was lower in treated-animals (p<0.05). Lungs from captopril-treated animals showed impaired alveolar formation, with enlarged distal airway spaces at P8, P15 and P30. Interalveolar wall distance measured by mean linear intercept increased in treated vs. age-matched animals at P8, P15 (p<0.001) and P30 (p<0.05) resembling new bronchopulmonary dysplasia. In control animals, the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) marker was higher at P0 and then drops gradually, while in captopril-treated animals PCNA marker remains higher at all stages studied. \u03b1-Smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), a marker of fibroblast differentiation into myofibroblasts, was higher at the tips of developing secondary septa in captopril-treated lungs at P8 and P15. The increased expression of PCNA and \u03b1-SMA in treated pups suggest that beyond the effect caused by captopril, the developing lungs have the capacity to recover once the treatment was stopped. Taking together the low weight, histomorphological changes and increased expression of cellular markers caused by ACE inhibition during late pregnancy, it appears that the RAS could be an intrinsic factor involved in secondary septa formation during lung development.",

    "839": "Islet transplantation provides an approach to compensate for loss of insulin-producing cells in patients with type 1 diabetes. However, the intraportal route of transplantation is associated with instant inflammatory reactions to the graft and subsequent islet destruction as well. Although matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-2 and -9 are involved in both remodeling of extracellular matrix and leukocyte migration, their influence on the outcome of islet transplantation has not been characterized. We observed comparable MMP-2 mRNA expressions in control and transplanted groups of mice, whereas MMP-9 mRNA and protein expression levels increased after islet transplantation. Immunostaining for CD11b (Mac-1)-expressing leukocytes (macrophage, neutrophils) and Ly6G (neutrophils) revealed substantially reduced inflammatory cell migration into islet-transplanted liver in MMP-9 knockout recipients. Moreover, gelatinase inhibition resulted in a significant increase in the insulin content of transplanted pancreatic islets and reduced macrophage and neutrophil influx compared with the control group. These results indicate that the increase of MMP-9 expression and activity after islet transplantation is directly related to enhanced leukocyte migration and that early islet graft survival can be improved by inhibiting MMP-9 (gelatinase B) activity.", 
    "840": "Ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring (ABPM) is the best method of detecting abnormal BP in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), whose hypertension may be missed with casual BP measurements. We report ABPM findings in 332 children 1 year after entry in the Chronic Kidney Disease in Children cohort study. All of the subjects underwent casual and ambulatory BP measurement. BP was categorized based on casual and ABPM results into normal (42%), white-coat (4%), masked (35%), and ambulatory (14%) hypertension. Only half of the subjects had a normal ABPM. BP load was elevated (>25%) in 52% (n = 172), whereas mean BP was elevated in 32% (n = 105). In multivariate analysis, those using an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor were 89% more likely to have a normal ABPM than those who did not report using an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (odds ratio, 1.89 [95% CI, 1.17-3.04]). For every 20% faster decline in annualized glomerular filtration rate change, the odds of an abnormal ABPM increased 26% (odds ratio, 1.26 [95% CI, 0.97-1.64]). A 2.25-fold increase in urine protein:creatinine ratio annualized change was associated with a 39% higher odds of an abnormal ABPM (odds ratio, 1.39 [95% CI, 1.06-1.82]). Abnormalities on ABPM are common in children with chronic kidney disease and are strongly associated with known risk factors for end-stage renal disease. Individuals on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were less likely to have abnormal ABPM, suggesting a possible therapeutic intervention. ABPM should be used to monitor risk and guide therapy in children with chronic kidney disease.",

Among Hispanics, lack of hypertension awareness and lack of effective blood pressure (BP) control are problematic, as are higher incidence rates of hypertension-related co-morbidities compared with non-Hispanic populations. Moreover, there are currently no hypertension treatment guidelines that address the unique characteristics of this ethnic group. This article discusses ethnic differences in hypertension and cardiovascular risk factors and reviews the literature on the efficacy of antihypertensive agents in Hispanic patients, with a focus on the role of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibition in the management of hypertension in these patients. Hypertension in Hispanic patients can be challenging to manage, in part because this population has a higher prevalence of obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome compared with non-Hispanic whites. The presence of these co-morbidities suggests that RAAS-inhibitor-based therapies may be particularly beneficial in this population. However, few studies have evaluated the efficacy of antihypertensive treatments in Hispanic patients. Two outcomes studies in hypertensive patients have shown the benefits of treating Hispanic patients with antihypertensive therapy and included RAAS inhibitors as part of the treatment regimen. In addition, BP-lowering trials have shown the antihypertensive efficacy of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and direct renin inhibitors, although data on the latter are more limited. Additional studies are needed to more thoroughly evaluate the effects of RAAS inhibitors (and other drug classes) on outcomes and BP lowering in the Hispanic hypertensive population.", 
    "850": "Although exogenous administration of Angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)] can prevent development of diabetes induced end-organ damage, little is known about the role of endogenous Ang-(1-7) in diabetes and requires further characterization. Here, we studied the effects of chronically inhibiting endogenous Ang-(1-7) formation with DX600, a selective angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) inhibitor, on renal and cardiac NADPH oxidase (NOX) activity, vascular reactivity and cardiac function in a model of Type-1 diabetes. The contribution of endogenous Ang-(1-7) to the protective effects of Losartan and Captopril and that of prostaglandins to the cardiovascular effects of exogenous Ang-(1-7) were also examined. Cardiac and renal NOX activity, vascular reactivity to endothelin-1 (ET-1) and cardiac recovery from ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury were evaluated in streptozotocin-treated rats. Chronic treatment with DX600 exacerbated diabetes-induced increase in cardiac and renal NOX activity. Diabetes-induced abnormal vascular reactivity to ET-1 and cardiac dysfunction were improved by treatment with Ang-(1-7) and worsened by treatment with DX600 or A779, a Mas receptor antagonist. Ang-(1-7)-mediated improvement in cardiac recovery or vascular reactivity was attenuated by Indomethacin. Captopril and Losartan-induced improvement in cardiovascular function was attenuated when these drugs were co-administered with A779. Ang-(1-7)-mediated decrease in renal NOX activity was prevented by indomethacin. Losartan also decreased renal NOX activity that could be attenuated with A779 co-treatment. In conclusion, endogenous Ang-(1-7) inhibits diabetes-induced cardiac/renal NOX activity and end-organ damage, and mediates the actions of Captopril and Losartan. Further, prostaglandins are important intermediaries in the beneficial effects of Ang-(1-7) in diabetes. Combining either Losartan or Captopril with Ang-(1-7) had additional beneficial effects in preventing diabetes-induced cardiac dysfunction and this may represent a novel therapeutic strategy. Collectively, these data shed new insights into the likely mechanism of action through which the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas receptor axis prevents Type 1 diabetes-induced cardiovascular dysfunction.",

The descriptors are first classified into different groups (based on the similarity in the information contents they are possessing) and then each group is subjected to principal component analysis (PCA), separately. The extracted principal components (PC) from the descriptor data matrix of each group can be considered as new sources of amino acid indices. These indices were used as input variables for QSAR study of two dipeptide data sets (58 angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor activity, and 48 bitter tasting threshold (BTT) activity). Modeling between the indices and biological activity was achieved utilizing segmented principal component regression (SPCR) and segmented partial least squares (SPLS) methods. Both methods resulted in reliable QSAR models. In comparison with conventional principal component regression (PCR) and partial least square (PLS), the segmented ones produced more predictive models. In addition, the developed models showed better performances with respect to the previously reported models for the same data sets. It can be concluded that by segmentation of variables and partitioning of the information into informative and redundant parts, it is possible to discard the redundant part of variables and to obtain more appropriate models.",

Electrogustometric thresholds of taste sensitivity were established with electrogustometer. The minimal intensity of the current, which stimulates nerve endings of the taste stimuli-transmitting nerves was determined in two areas of the tongue: at the apex and at the sides. By two different methods of evaluation it was shown that the analyzed groups of hypotensive drugs affect the taste sensitivity of the patients. It was observed that healthy people had higher taste sensitivity than patients. Introducing ACE-I into combined therapy significantly reduced the electrogustometric sensitivity in patients.",

The effects of different antihypertensive drug classes on noninvasively assessed markers of arterial stiffness are also discussed. Current evidence will be reviewed regarding the effect of drugs on arterial stiffness, including the peripheral and central effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor antagonists, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, beta blockers (including vasodilating beta blockers), diuretics, and mineralocorticoid antagonists.", 
    "868": "Age and hypertension are two major determinants of arterial stiffness, as well as endothelial dysfunction. The present study was designed to test whether a chronic reduction of endogenous nitric oxide (NO) produces arterial stiffening close to that observed in old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), and also to study the effect of an acute or a chronic decrease in blood pressure (BP) on aortic distensibility.", 
    "869": "BP, aortic stiffness, endothelial dysfunction and remodelling were measured in male adult (20-week-old) SHR, in adult SHR treated with a nonspecific NO synthase inhibitor L-NAME (SHR/L-NAME) for 2 weeks, in adult SHR/L-NAME cotreated with perindopril (1 mg/kg/day) and in old SHR (55-week-old). Age-matched WKY were used as a normotensive group.",

Outpatient Black and White hypertensive patients were selected for these studies. In study H2303, 201 patients of both sexes and races, whose mean seated diastolic blood pressure (MSDBP) was \u226595\u2009mmHg after 4 weeks of single-blind treatment with benazepril 40\u2009mg/day, were randomized into two groups.

Combination therapy resulted in greater lowering of MSDBP and mean seated systolic blood pressure (MSSBP) than monotherapy with either benazepril or amlodipine (p\u2009<\u20090.001). With respect to combination therapy, the combination of amlodipine/benazepril 10/20\u2009mg/day resulted in greater blood pressure (BP) reductions in White patients than in Black patients (p\u2009<\u20090.004). In contrast, the combination of amlodipine/benazepril 10/40\u2009mg/day resulted in similar BP reductions in both Black and White hypertensive patients.

Principal components analysis with biplots did not identify measurement discrepancies. Multiple imputation with chained equations addressed missing predictor values. A proportional hazards model with interaction term, including graphical interpretation and a multivariate interaction test, identified heterogeneity of treatment effect. An interval of homogeneity of treatment effect was the interval of the baseline risk of outcome in which no two treatment effects were statistically significantly different.

One clinical trial in patients at low risk for CVD and stroke found that diastolic blood pressure was reduced by 1.6 mm Hg and LDL-C was reduced by 17.7 mg/dL, correlating with 44% and 21% reduction in the relative risks of CVD and stroke, respectively. Studies in higher risk patients reported reductions in systolic blood pressure of up to 28.8 mm Hg and in LDL-C of up to 54 mg/dL, correlating with 62% and 60% relative reduction in risks of CVD and stroke, respectively.",

Anemia is associated with pre-operative blood loss and allograft dysfunction, including delayed graft function, acute rejection and chronic allograft dysfunction. To study the prevalence and association of post-renal transplant anemia, we studied 200 renal transplant recipients; 131 (65.5%) patients were males and 69 (34.5%) patients were females, and age ranged from 17 to 67 years, with a mean of 37.7 \u00b1 10.8 years. All patients were receiving cyclosporine, prednisolone and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). Complete blood count was done at two times: three and six months post-renal transplant. There were 74% anemic patients three months after renal transplantation and 45% anemic patients six months after renal transplantation. High creatinine value, female gender, delayed graft function, episodes of acute rejection, perioperative blood loss and infections were the only significant independent risk factors for prevalence of anemia post-renal transplant. In our study, we did not find an association between MMF and cyclosporine nor angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptors blocker (ARBs) with anemia. This study demonstrates that anemia is a common complication during the first six months after kidney transplantation, with several risk factors precipitating this complication.", 
    "887": "In dogs, activation of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS) is an important feature of congestive heart failure (CHF). Long-term increases in angiotensin II (AII) and aldosterone (ALD) lead to the progression of heart failure to its end stage. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) are the foremost therapeutic option in the management of CHF. Recent literature has challenged the efficacy of ACEIs, based on modest reduction in urinary aldosterone (UALD) excretion despite marked inhibition of ACE activity. This study was designed to heighten the understanding of the effect of benazepril, a potent ACEI, on the RAAS, using a low-sodium diet as an experimental model of RAAS activation. Time course profiles of RAAS peptides and related areas under the curve (AUC) were used for comparison between benazepril and placebo groups. Results indicated substantial changes in the dynamics of these biomarkers. At presumed benazeprilat steady state, significant differences in AUC of plasma renin activity (+90%), angiotensin I (+43%), and AII (-53%) were found between benazepril and placebo-treated dogs. ALD decreased by 73% in plasma but only by 5% in urine. In conclusion, despite modest reduction in UALD excretion, benazepril markedly influences RAAS dynamics in dogs.",

Many factors including renal mechanisms and the renin-angiotensin system are involved in the regulatory mechanisms of blood pressure. Genetic and environmental factors interact to affect multiple factors related to hypertensive mechanisms. Recent data suggested that genetic risk factors have been useful in clinical practice. The evidence that treatment of hypertension reduces cardiovascular diseases come from the results of large-scale therapeutic trials. Significant progress has been made during the last several decades in the treatment of hypertension through the use of inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system, with either angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor type 1 blockers. In this review, I summarize my personal career related to hypertension research.",

The main aim of this study was to find the method suitable not only for determination of cilazapril, but additionally useful in degradation kinetic study. Only the HPLC method is stability indicating. The HPLC method utilizes LiChroCART 250-4 HPLC-Cartridge, LiChrospher 100 RP-18 (5 \u03bcm) column, at ambient temperature, eluted at the flow rate 1.0 mL/min. The mobile phase consists of acetonitrile, methanol and phosphate buffer (pH 2.0) (60:10:30, v/v/v). Wavelength of detection is set at 212 nm. Benzocaine is used as an internal standard. The second and third order derivative spectrophotometric methods can be applied for the cilazapril analysis in substance and tablet, but not for stability evaluation (the lack of selectivity towards degradation product).", 
    "890": "The authors undertook comparative analysis of the effica,cy and safety of PPARv-activating angiotensin-2 receptor blocker telmisartan (40--80 mg/day) in 80 patients with arterial hypertension (AH) and metabolic disorders (MD). Holter monitoring revealed a more pronounced anti-hypertensive effect of telmisartan compared with enalapril in patients with AH, MD, and compromised renal function. Similarly, telmisartan exerted more apparent positive effect on lipid and carbohydrate metabolism and had renoprotective action in patients with nephrogenic AH (it decreased proteinuria, stabilized creatinine clearance and serum potassium level whereas enalapril caused further deterioration of these parameters). It is concluded that telmisratan is more effective and safer than enalapril in patients with AH and MD.",

We aimed to investigate the proportion of patients with MetS in patients undergoing cardiac rehabilitation (CR), and to describe differences between patients with MetS compared to those without MetS with regard to (1) patient characteristics including demographics, risk factors, and comorbidities, (2) risk factor management including drug treatment, and (3) control status of risk factors at entry to CR and discharge from CR.", 
    "892": "Post-hoc analysis of data from 27,904 inpatients (Transparency Registry to Objectify Guideline-Oriented Risk Factor Management registry) that underwent a CR period of about 3 weeks were analyzed descriptively in total and compared by their MetS status.", 
    "893": "In the total cohort, mean age was 64.3 years, (71.7% male), with no major differences between groups. Patients had been referred after a ST elevation of myocardial infarction event in 41.1% of cases, non-ST elevation of myocardial infarction in 21.8%, or angina pectoris in 16.7%. They had received a percutaneous coronary intervention in 55.1% and bypass surgery (coronary artery bypass graft) in 39.5%. Patients with MetS (n = 15,819) compared to those without MetS (n = 12,085) were less frequently males, and in terms of cardiac interventions, more often received coronary artery bypass surgery. Overall, statin use increased from 79.9% at entry to 95.0% at discharge (MetS: 79.7% to 95.2%). Patients with MetS compared to those without MetS received angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, oral antidiabetics, and insulin at entry and discharge more frequently, and less frequently clopidogrel and aspirin/clopidogrel combinations. Mean blood pressure was within the normal range at discharge, and did not differ substantially between groups (124/73 versus 120/72 mmHg). Overall, between entry and discharge, levels of total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides were substantially lowered, in particular in MetS patients. Thus, control rates of lipid parameters improved substantially, with the exception of high density lipoprotein cholesterol. Low density lipoprotein cholesterol rates <100 mg/dL increased from 38.7% at entry to 73.8% at discharge (MetS: from 39.4% to 74.6%) and triglycerides control rates (<150 mg/dL) from 58.1% to 70.4% (MetS: 43.7% to 62.2%). Physical fitness on exercise testing improved substantially in both groups.",

    "895": "Currently, it is clear that primary hypertension begins in childhood and that it contributes to the early development of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Hypertension also increases the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and that risk rises as blood pressure levels escalate. As among adult patients, overweight and obesity rates are on the rise among children and adolescents with primary hypertension and can develop target organ damage including left ventricular hypertrophy. An elevated level of C-reactive protein (CRP) and microalbuminuria are early manifestations of cardiovascular disease and CKD in hypertensive patients. Lifestyle interventions are recommended for all children with hypertension. Pharmacologic therapy should be added for symptomatic children, those with stage 2 hypertension, and children with prehypertension and stage 1 hypertension who exhibit an insufficient response to lifestyle modifications. Although the recommendations for choice of drugs generally are similar for children and adults, dosages for children should be lower, based on weight, and adjusted very carefully. Medications that are effective and safe for children and adolescents include thiazide diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-blockers, and calcium channel-blockers. Hypertension is not being detected early enough for initiation of a treatment regimen to reduce death and disability. Initiatives should be undertaken to make health care providers and the general population more aware of the seriousness of hypertension in children and adolescents. This review focuses on the principles underlying the importance of a team approach for hypertension control, especially one that incorporates increased data sharing using enhanced health information technology for early detection and intervention.", 
    "896": "Preclinical studies have elucidated molecular pathways by which specific classes of antihypertensive agents may promote, or protect, against tumor development and progression. Observational studies have proposed an association between antihypertensive agents and cancer, but due to limitations inherent to their study design cannot alone establish causality. Moreover, prospective randomized clinical trials (RCT) of antihypertensive agents have focused on cardiovascular and renal outcomes, rather than incidence of new cancer, making inference from RCTs problematic. The purpose of this review was to highlight the classes of medications implicated in increased cancer risk, with a focus on angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) therapy, as recent published data surrounding their use remains the most controversial.", 
    "897": "A recent meta-analysis of RCTs found a significant increase in the risk of cancer with ARBs when compared with control, eliciting a safety review by the Food and Drug Administration. Subsequently, more robust meta-analyses have refuted these findings, demonstrating no association between any of the currently used antihypertensive agents and cancer. Despite the complex methodology of these meta-analyses, the randomized trials used for analysis are fraught with inconsistencies, including the availability of cancer outcomes, a brief time to follow-up as compared with the latency of cancer, and heterogeneous use of antihypertensive agents.", 
    "898": "The medical literature has long hypothesized potentially carcinogenic effects of antihypertensive agents, but to date there is no convincing evidence that any of the individual antihypertensives in clinical use, at the dosages and duration tested, lead to higher rates of cancer.", 
    "899": "The canonical renin-angiotensin system (RAS) involves the initial action of renin to cleave angiotensinogen to angiotensin I (ANG I), which is then converted to ANG II by the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). ANG II plays a critical role in numerous physiological functions, and RAS overactivity underlies many conditions of cardiovascular dysregulation. In addition, ANG II, by acting on both endothelial and myocellular AT1 receptors, can induce insulin resistance by increasing cellular oxidative stress, leading to impaired insulin signaling and insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity. This insulin resistance associated with RAS overactivity, when coupled with progressive \u00df-cell dysfunction, eventually leads to the development of type 2 diabetes. Interventions that target RAS overactivity, including ACE inhibitors, ANG II receptor blockers, and, most recently, renin inhibitors, are effective both in reducing hypertension and in improving whole-body and skeletal muscle insulin action, due at least in part to enhanced Akt-dependent insulin signaling and insulin-dependent glucose transport activity. ANG-(1-7), which is produced from ANG II by the action of ACE2 and acts via Mas receptors, can counterbalance the deleterious actions of the ACE/ANG II/AT1 receptor axis on the insulin-dependent glucose transport system in skeletal muscle. This beneficial effect of the ACE2/ANG-(1-7)/Mas receptor axis appears to depend on the activation of Akt. Collectively, these findings underscore the importance of RAS overactivity in the multifactorial etiology of insulin resistance in skeletal muscle, and provide support for interventions that target the RAS to ameliorate both cardiovascular dysfunctions and insulin resistance in skeletal muscle tissue.", 
    "900": "Given the poor prognosis of glioblastoma, we have been investigating treatments adjunctive to the current standard of resection, irradiation and temozolomide. Our focus has been on exploring already-marketed medicines that have evidence of inhibiting growth factors previously identified as active and important in glioblastoma. In this short note we describe how previous research has demonstrated that the common angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril used to treat hypertension and for renal protection inhibits 72-kDa matrix metalloproteinase-2 and 92-kDa matrix metalloproteinase-9, which a separate body of research shows are used by glioblastoma cells to grow and invade. We review these bodies of data and combine them to conclude that captopril may slow glioblastoma progression. Two other drugs, the aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor disulfiram used to treat alcoholism and the anti-HIV protease inhibitor nelfinavir also have a database supporting their incidental inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases. Given the importance of matrix metalloproteinases in helping glioblastomas grow and invade, we suggest that this trio-captopril, disulfiram, and nelfinavir-be tested for antiglioblastoma activity.", 
    "901": "Atherosclerosis is a highly complex biological process that has become the scourge of modern civilization. Endothelial dysfunction is the first step in the development of atherosclerosis. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays an important role in the development of endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis. Several studies have shown that in vitro blockade of the RAAS is associated with improvement in markers of endothelial dysfunction and inflammation. Many clinical trials have demonstrated a clear benefit of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) manifested by a reduction of cardiovascular events. These findings suggest that ACEIs and ARBs can play an important role in prevention of atherosclerosis and in the delay of its progression. In this review we focus on the importance of RAAS blockade to prevent or delay progression of atherosclerosis and its impact on reduction of cardiovascular events.", 
    "902": "In the updated concept of renin-angiotensin system (RAS), it contains the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-angiotensin (Ang) II-angtiogensin type 1 receptor (AT1) axis and the angiotensin-converting enzyme-related carboxypeptidase (ACE2)-Ang-(1-7)-Mas axis. The former axis has been well demonstrated performing the vasoconstrictive, proliferative and pro-inflammatory functions by activation of AT1 receptors, while the later new identified axis is considered counterbalancing the effects of the former. The present study is aimed at observing the interaction between Ang-(1-7) and Ang II on cultured rat renal mesangial cells (MCs). RT-PCR, Western blot and immunofluorescent staining and confocal microscopy results showed that both AT1 and Mas receptor were co-distributed in rat renal MCs. Ang-(1-7) showed similar effects on Ang II in cultured MCs that stimulated phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 phosphorylation and transforms growth factor-\u03b21 synthesis, and cell proliferation and extracellular matrix synthesis. Co-treatment of the cell with Ang-(1-7) and Ang II, Ang-(1-7) counteracted AngII-induced effects in a concentration dependent manner, but failed to alter the changes induced by endothelin-1. The stimulating effect of Ang II was mediated by AT1 receptor while all the effects of Ang-(1-7) were blocked by Mas receptor antagonist A-779, but not by AT1 receptor antagonist losartan or AT2 receptor antagonist PD123319. These results suggest that Ang-(1-7) and Ang II specifically interact with each other on rat renal MCs via activation of their specific receptors, Mas and AT1 receptor respectively.",

It is important to pay an attention especially to hypoglycaemia, which brings many risks in the elderly. An article is focused on probable drug interactions when combination of various antidiabetics, antidiabetics with antihypertensives or hypolipidemics is used. Despite ACE-inhibitors and beta-blockers can influence the compensation of diabetics, their use is not contraindicated in these patients, because of their huge benefit in the prevention of cardiovascular events. An article brings an overview of antidiabetics metabolised by means of the system of cytochrome P 450 and resulting drug interactions with inhibitors and inductors of these enzymes. These drug interactions are not usually important in clinical practice and it is possible to prevent them with careful monitoring of glycaemia, instruction of patients and alternatively modification of the doses of hypoglycaemic medication after a termination of the treatment of responsible inductor or inhibitor.",

Individual-level linkage of nationwide administrative registries of hospitalizations, concomitant medications, and socioeconomic status was performed to gain insights into the use of pharmacological treatment. A total of 693 patients (mean age 46.1 \u00b1 12.7 years, 65.7% male) with severe psoriasis treated with biologic agents were identified. Hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes mellitus were identified in 16.6%, 9.2%, and 6.7% of cases, respectively. Patients with severe psoriasis were significantly less likely to receive cardiovascular pharmacotherapy compared to age, sex, and coronary risk factor matched controls. In psoriatic patients with hypertension 27.7% received no antihypertensive pharmacotherapy. Patients with dyslipidemia received cholesterol-lowering medications in 55.8% of cases and patients with diabetes mellitus received angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers and cholesterol-lowering medications in 42.1% and 23.7% of cases, respectively. Similar results were found for the subset of patients with >1 coronary risk factor and for high risk patients with established atherosclerotic disease.",

The prevalence of anti-hypertensive pharmacologic therapy was 4.2% (95% CI 3.5%-4.9%). The prevalence of hypertension was relatively stable across the study period; the age and race adjusted odds of hypertension in 2007-2008 did not differ significantly from 1999-2000 (odds ratio 1.2, CI 0.8 to 1.7, p = 0.45). Significant independent risk factors associated with hypertension included older age, non-Hispanic black race (compared to non-Hispanic whites), diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and higher body mass index. The most commonly used antihypertensive medications included diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE), and beta blockers.",

    "925": "Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCMP) is a dilated and hypokinetic cardiomyopathy occurring during pregnancy or after delivery, with an estimated incidence between 1/1000 and 1/4000 births. It has been defined as a new onset of heart failure in the month preceding or following delivery, without demonstrated aetiology nor previously known heart disease, and with echocardiographic evidences of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction (LV ejection fraction<0.45). It's a multifactorial disease, immunologic, hormonal, and possibly viral mechanisms playing a determinant pathophysiological role. The classical clinical presentation is a rapid and unexpected onset of heart failure in a previously healthy woman, echocardiography being the key examination for positive and differential diagnosis, prognostication, therapeutic decision-making, and follow-up. The potential severity of PPCMP, and its unpredictable evolution in the first days following diagnosis, require that patients be referred to a tertiary care centre with a high skill in intensive cardiology care. Therapeutic management of PPCMP does not offer any specificity when compared to other causes of acute or chronic heart failure (from diuretics to extracorporeal life support), except for ACE-inhibitors, that are contraindicated before delivery. The high incidence of thrombo-embolic complications observed in the disease requires however rapid and curative anticoagulation, and immuno-suppressive treatment has been proposed in fulminant and highly inflammatory presentation, but its efficacy remains controversial. Very recently, promising results have been reported with bromocriptin-a prolactin secretion inhibitor-for reducing 6-month morbidity and mortality, but these findings have to be confirmed in larger scale randomised trials. As for the long-term evolution, approximately half of the patients will heal, while half of the women will keep some degree of LV dysfunction, 25% of them developing moderate to severe chronic heart failure.",

It is characterized from maternal hypertension in late pregnancy and peripheral tissue damage, including kidney, heart and placenta, and the fetus suffers from intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) and high perinatal mortality. Recently, it has been postulated that angiotensin II (Ang II), a potent vasoconstrictor in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia; however, the beneficial effect of the suppression of RAS has not yet been fully elucidated. Previously, we generated a transgenic mouse model that developed pregnancy-associated hypertension (PAH) by the overproduction of Ang II in maternal circulation during late pregnancy. In addition, mice with PAH exhibited maternal and fetal abnormalities, such as proteinuria, cardiac hypertrophy, placental morphological changes and IUGR. In this study, in order to attenuate the activity of redundant RAS during the advanced stages of PAH, we administered olmesartan (Olm), an angiotensin receptor blocker, and captopril (Cp), an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, from E17 to E19 days of gestation, and evaluated its effect on cardiac and placental abnormalities and fetal growth. Olm and Cp administration significantly lowered the blood pressure of mice with PAH, and placental histological change and severe IUGR were markedly ameliorated in both groups. On the contrary, Olm or Cp treatment had little effect on cardiac remodeling during the advanced stages of PAH. These findings highlight a variety of therapeutic actions of RAS repression on the progressive pathology of PAH in mice.",

When the angiotensin-converting enzyme is inhibited, bradykinin metabolism is dependent on degradation by neutral endopeptidase, dipeptidyl peptidase IV, and aminopeptidase P. When these enzymes are inhibited, as in treatment of diabetes or in transplant recipients, the incidence of angioedema increases significantly. African-Americans, people over 65, women, and those with a history of smoking are especially at risk. A fiberoptic laryngeal examination should be performed in all patients. Patients with rapid progression of symptoms are at risk for airway compromise. Supportive treatment with steroids and antihistamines is not very effective.

This study tested the hypothesis that ACE inhibition enhances fibrinolysis and inflammation to a greater extent than ARB in patients undergoing CPB. One week to 5 days before surgery, patients were randomized to ramipril 5 mg/day, candesartan 16 mg/day, or placebo. ACE inhibition increased intraoperative bradykinin and tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA ) concentrations as compared to AR B. Both ACE inhibition and AR B decreased the need for plasma transfusion relative to placebo, but only ACE inhibition decreased the duration of hospital stay. Neither ACE inhibition nor AR B significantly affected concentrations of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI -1), interleukin (IL )-6, IL -8, or IL -10. ACE inhibition enhanced intraoperative fibrinolysis without increasing the likelihood of red-cell transfusion. By contrast, neither ACE inhibition nor ARB affected the inflammatory response.

    "952": "The pathophysiology of thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) formation involves a complex interplay of genetic predisposition, cardiovascular risk factors, and hemodynamic forces. The medical community has resorted to the use of pharmacologic agents based on weak data transplanted from either abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) or Marfan syndrome. However, aneurysms differ significantly based on their anatomic location and etiology. Epidemiologic and experimental data demonstrate that different genetic and nongenetic risk factors as well as diverse physiologic processes are responsible for the development and progression of sporadic TAA, familial TAA, and AAA. Therefore, these disease processes need to be considered as distinct entities and not hastily grouped together. The extrapolation of data from one aneurysmal disease process to another is still ill-founded and potentially harmful. Clinical trials in TAA are required before medical therapies, such as \u03b2-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, statins, or macrolide antibiotics, can be recommended.", 
    "953": "The RAS (renin-angiotensin system) is now recognized as an important regulator of liver fibrosis and portal pressure. Liver injury stimulates the hepatic expression of components of the RAS, such as ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) and the AT(1) receptor [AngII (angiotensin II) type 1 receptor], which play an active role in promoting inflammation and deposition of extracellular matrix. In addition, the more recently recognized structural homologue of ACE, ACE2, is also up-regulated. ACE2 catalyses the conversion of AngII into Ang-(1-7) [angiotensin-(1-7)], and there is accumulating evidence that this 'alternative axis' of the RAS has anti-fibrotic, vasodilatory and anti-proliferative effects, thus counterbalancing the effects of AngII in the liver. The RAS is also emerging as an important contributor to the pathophysiology of portal hypertension in cirrhosis. Although the intrahepatic circulation in cirrhosis is hypercontractile in response to AngII, resulting in increased hepatic resistance, the splanchnic vasculature is hyporesponsive, promoting the development of the hyperdynamic circulation that characterizes portal hypertension. Both liver fibrosis and portal hypertension represent important therapeutic challenges for the clinician, and there is accumulating evidence that RAS blockade may be beneficial in these circumstances. The present review outlines new aspects of the RAS and explores its role in the pathogenesis and treatment of liver fibrosis and portal hypertension.", 
    "954": "Modulation of the RAS (renin-angiotensin system), in particular of the function of the hormones AngII (angiotensin II) and Ang-(1-7) [angiotensin-(1-7)], is an important target for pharmacotherapy in the cardiovascular system. In the classical view, such modulation affects cardiovascular cells to decrease hypertrophy, fibrosis and endothelial dysfunction, and improves diuresis. In this view, excessive stimulation of AT(1) receptors (AngII type 1 receptors) fulfils a detrimental role, as it promotes cardiovascular pathogenesis, and this is opposed by stimulation of the AT(2) receptor (angiotensin II type 2 receptor) and the Ang-(1-7) receptor encoded by the Mas proto-oncogene. In recent years, this view has been broadened with the observation that the RAS regulates bone marrow stromal cells and stem cells, thus involving haematopoiesis and tissue regeneration by progenitor cells. This change of paradigm has enlarged the field of perspectives for therapeutic application of existing as well as newly developed medicines that alter angiotensin signalling, which now stretches beyond cardiovascular therapy. In the present article, we review the role of AngII and Ang-(1-7) and their respective receptors in haematopoietic and mesenchymal stem cells, and discuss possible pharmacotherapeutical implications.",

Baseline echocardiographic data: end-systolic and end-diastolic volume indices (ESVI and EDVI), left atrium to aorta ratio (LA/Ao), and regurgitant fraction (RF) are reported. Median survival time (MST) was 430 d. Initial dosage of furosemide (P = 0.0081) and LA/Ao (P = 0.042) were negatively associated with survival. Baseline echocardiographic indices (mean \u00b1 standard deviation) were 40.24 \u00b1 16.76 for ESVI, 161.48 \u00b1 44.49 mL/m(2) for EDVI, 2.11 \u00b1 0.75 for LA/Ao, and 64.71 \u00b1 16.85% for RF.

The diagnosis is largely clinical and requires a high index of suspicion. Provocation studies are rarely performed due to the risks of the procedure and the relatively low incidence of disease. A subset of patients does not respond to conventional medical therapy and a paucity of evidence exists to guide therapy. While generally believed a multifocal phenomenon, there have been reports of successful treatment of focal, refractory vasospasm with coronary stent implantation. Furthermore, consideration of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator is warranted when vasospasm is complicated by lethal ventricular arrhythmias.", 
    "957": "Arterial hypertension is a widely prevalent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases with well documented harmful effects on the heart and the vascular system. Despite a broad antihypertensive drug armamentarium control of hypertension is worldwide suboptimal. Daily practice as well as large intervention trials show that single-drug therapy often fails to adequately control blood pressure (BP). Therefore, the early introduction of a combination therapy may lead to a better and more rapid BP lowering effect, particularly in patients with more than stage I hypertension or in patients with mild hypertension and high cardiovascular risk. In addition, side effects of an antihypertensive drug can be prevented by a meaningful (low dose) combination with a second antihypertensive agent. Moreover, combination of antihypertensive drugs, especially if provided fixed, may substantially improve compliance. However, the choice of the drug combination primarily relates on the demographic features and co-morbidities of the patient. Although BP lowering is the main determinant of cardiovascular risk reduction in the treatment of hypertension, some antihypertensive drugs may exhibit protective effects beyond BP reduction that have to be considered when antihypertensive drugs are combined. In recent large intervention studies, the combination of an ACE inhibitor with a calcium channel blocker was especially advantageous in high risk hypertensive patients. The addition of a thiazide type diuretic to a blocker of the renin-angiotensin system is also sensible and popular with numerous available fixed combinations.",

Here we present the case of an 8-year-old boy with WAS who developed hematuria, proteinuria, and declining renal function that did not improve with the combined use of immunosuppressive agents and angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor. Renal pathology revealed IgA nephropathy (IgAN). The patient underwent splenectomy for refractory thrombocytopenia. The proteinuria remitted and renal function improved after splenectomy, long-term antibiotic prophylaxis, and tapering of immunosuppressive agents.", 
    "959": "One of the most difficult challenges health care providers encounter is drug selection for pregnant patients. Drug selection can be complex as efficacy and maternal side effects must be weighed against potential risk to the embryo or fetus. Verification of an individual drug's fetal safety is limited as most evidence is deduced from epidemiologic, prospective cohort, or case-control studies. Medication selection for the pregnant inpatient is a particularly complex task as the illnesses and conditions that require hospitalization mandate different medications, and the risk versus benefit ratio can vary significantly compared to the outpatient setting. Some degree of acute pain is not uncommon among inpatients. Acetaminophen is generally considered the drug of choice in pregnancy for mild to moderate acute pain, while most opioids are thought to be safe for short-term use to manage moderate to severe pain. Providing sedation is particularly challenging as the few options available for the general population are further limited by either known increased risk of congenital malformations or very limited human pregnancy data. Propofol is the only agent recommended for continuous sedation, which has a Food and Drug Administration classification as a pregnancy category B medication. Treatment of infections in hospitalized patients requires balancing the microbiology profile against the fetal risk. Older antimicrobials proven generally safe include beta-lactams, and those with proven fetal risks include tetracyclines. However, little to no information regarding gestational use is available on the newer antimicrobials that are frequently employed to treat resistant infections more commonly found in the inpatient setting. Management of maternal blood pressure is based on the severity of blood pressure elevations and not the hypertensive classification. Agents generally considered safe to use in hypertensive pregnant patients include methyldopa, labetolol, and hydralazine, while angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, hydrochlorothiazide, and atenolol should be avoided.", 
    "960": "Mechanism(s) of cisplatin-induced acute renal failure, as manifested by increases in blood urea nitrogen and creatinine, was evaluated in relation to production and activation of endogenous mediator(s) in mice. In interleukin (IL)-18-deficient (IL-18KO) mice, cisplatin failed to induce acute renal failure. Administration of recombinant IL-18 prior to cisplatin restored acute renal failure in IL-18KO mice. Accumulation of cisplatin in the kidney was not different in IL-18KO and wild-type (WT) mice, but, clearance of cisplatin was more rapid in IL-18KO mice than in WT mice. Cisplatin increased serum levels of aldosterone and angiotensin II in WT mice, but only angiotensin II levels in IL-18 KO mice. Administration of IL-18 augmented plasma levels of aldosterone and angiotensin II in WT mice. Eplerenone, an aldosterone receptor blocker, TY-51469, a chymase inhibitor and PD123319, a selective angiotensin II type 2 (AT2) receptor antagonist, but not benazepril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and candesartan, a selective angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist improved acute renal failure caused by cisplatin, confirming involvement of IL-18, aldosterone and angiotensin II in cisplatin-induced, chymase-dependent acute renal failure in mice. These results show that IL-18, aldosterone and angiotensin II synergistically act to prolong the accumulation of cisplatin in the kidney, leading to acute renal failure. Combined therapy with inhibitors for chymase and aldosterone receptors or AT2 receptors might reduce acute renal failure induced by cisplatin.",

Acetylcholine (2 \u03bcmol/L) produced a hyperpolarization sensitive to TRAM-34, a blocker of intermediate-conductance Ca(2+) -sensitive K(+) channels (IK(Ca)), but not to apamin, a blocker of small-conductance Ca(2+)-sensitive K(+) channels (SK(Ca)). NS309 (3 \u03bcmol/L), an activator of SK(Ca) and IK(Ca) channels, produced a hyperpolarization of similar magnitude as ACh. 3. In the HSD group, the ACh-evoked hyperpolarization was significantly attenuated compared with that in the control group, which was fed normal chow rather than an HSD. Similarly, the hyperpolarization produced by NS309 was weaker in tissues from HSD-fed rats. 4. Combination of HSD with chronic enalapril treatment (20 mg/kg per day for 1 month) normalized endothelial hyperpolarizing responses to ACh. Chronic tempol treatment (1 mmol/L in tap water for 1 month) prevented the reduced hyperpolarization to ACh. 5. The results of the present study indicate that excess in dietary Na(+) results in a failure of endothelial cells to generate normal IK(Ca) channel-mediated hyperpolarizing responses. Our observations implicate oxidative stress mediated by increased angiotensin II signalling as a mechanism underlying altered endothelial hyperpolarization during dietary salt loading.",

We compared the incidence of new-onset AF between patients who were (N= 10 918) and were not (N= 17 702) prescribed ACEI and/or ARB within 1 month of hospital discharge following cardiac event. New-onset AF within 5 and 10 years was 39.1 and 61.1%, respectively, in patients who received ACEI/ARB, compared 34.9 and 53.6% in patients who did not receive them [unadjusted hazard ratio (HR): 1.16; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.11, 1.21]. Multivariable analysis adjusting for patient- and hospital-related characteristics indicated that ACEI/ARB use independently had no impact on the risk of developing new-onset AF compared with non-users (adjusted HR: 0.99; 95% CI: 0.94, 1.04).

    "974": "This study examined the effects of anti-TGF-\u03b2 antibody (1D11) therapy in Dahl S (S) rats fed a 4% NaCl diet. Baseline renal expression of TGF-\u03b21 and the degree of injury were lower in female than male S rats maintained on a 0.4% NaCl diet. 4% NaCl diet increased mean arterial pressure (MAP), proteinuria, and renal injury to the same extent in both male and female S rats. Chronic treatment with 1D11 had renoprotective effects in both sexes. The ability of 1D11 to oppose the development of proteinuria when given alone or in combination with antihypertensive agents was further studied in 6-wk-old female S rats, since baseline renal injury was less than that seen in male rats. 1D11, diltiazem, and hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) attenuated the development of hypertension, proteinuria, and glomerular injury. 1D11 had no additional effect when given in combination with these antihypertensive agents. We also explored whether 1D11 could reverse renal injury in 9-wk-old male S rats with preexisting renal injury. MAP increased to 197 \u00b1 4 mmHg and proteinuria rose to >300 mg/day after 3 wk on a 4% NaCl diet. Proteinuria was reduced by 30-40% in rats treated with 1D11, HCT, or captopril + 1D11, but the protective effect was lost in rats fed the 4% NaCl diet for 6 wk. Nevertheless, 1D11, HCT, and captopril + 1D11 still reduced renomedullary and cardiac fibrosis. These results indicate that anti-TGF-\u03b2 antibody therapy reduces renal and cardiac fibrosis and affords additional renoprotection when given in combination with various antihypertensive agents in Dahl S rats.", 
    "975": "In recent years, ACE Inhibitors (ACEIs) and Angiotensin II receptor antagonists (also known as AT1 receptor antagonists (AT1-RAs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), or Sartans), have become the drugs of choice for the treatment of hypertension, heart and renal failure, coronary artery diseases, myocardial infarction and diabetes. By suppressing angiotensin and potentiating bradykinin effects, ACEIs and ARBs activate hemodynamic, metabolic and cellular mechanisms that not only reduce high blood pressure, but also protect the endothelium, the heart, the kidney and the brain, namely the target organs which are at risk in cardiovascular diseases. Major therapeutic benefits of these drugs are the reduction of cardiovascular events and the amelioration of the quality of life and of the patient survival. Results from large clinical trials have established that ACEIs and ARBs are efficient and safe drugs, suitable for the chronic treatments of cardiovascular diseases. Side effects are rare and easily manageable in most cases. The following is a brief review of the basic actions and mechanisms by which two opposing systems, the renin-angiotensin (RAS) and the kallikrein-kinin (KKS), interact in the regulation of cardiovascular and fluid homeostasis to keep the balance in healthy life and correct the imbalance in pathological conditions. Here we discuss how and why imbalances created by overactive RAS are best corrected by treatments with ACEI or AT1-RAs.",

Considering the outcome, 93.33% of cases recovered from ADRs, whereas in 6.66% cases were continuing. Causality assessment showed that majority of ADRs was probable and were found to be moderately severe.",

    "981": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) shares some homology with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) but is not inhibited by ACE inhibitors. The main role of ACE2 is the degradation of Ang II resulting in the formation of angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7) which opposes the actions of Ang II. Increased Ang II levels are thought to upregulate ACE2 activity, and in ACE2 deficient mice Ang II levels are approximately double that of wild-type mice, whilst Ang 1-7 levels are almost undetectable. Thus, ACE2 plays a crucial role in the RAS because it opposes the actions of Ang II. Consequently, it has a beneficial role in many diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease where its expression is decreased. Not surprisingly, current therapeutic strategies for ACE2 involve augmenting its expression using ACE2 adenoviruses, recombinant ACE2 or compounds in these diseases thereby affording some organ protection.", 
    "982": "Hypertension and renal disease are closely related. In fact, there is an inverse linear relationship between renal function and prevalence of hypertension. Hypertensive patients with renal dysfunction exhibit a poor clinical profile, which markedly increases their risk for cardiovascular outcomes. This review considers the available evidence on the best therapeutic approach for optimizing renovascular protection in the hypertensive population. To effectively reduce or at least slow the establishment and progression of renal disease in the hypertensive population it is critical to reach blood pressure targets. Many studies have shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers prevent or at least delay the development of microalbuminuria in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes, reduce the incidence of overt diabetic nephropathy, and are also beneficial in patients with nondiabetic renal disease. Therefore, renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibition plays a key role in the prevention of renal outcomes. As the majority of patients with hypertension will need at least two antihypertensive agents to achieve blood pressure goals, the use of RAS inhibitors is a mandatory part of antihypertensive therapy. The question of which antihypertensive agent is the best choice for combining with RAS blockers should be considered. Many studies have shown that diuretics and calcium channel blockers are the best choice. However, more studies are needed to clarify the subgroups of patients who will benefit more from a combination with a diuretic or from a combination with a calcium channel blocker. To date, RAS inhibitors recommended in this context are angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers. Aliskiren, the first oral direct renin inhibitor available, has shown promising results.", 
    "983": "While elevated plasma prorenin levels are commonly found in diabetic patients and correlate with diabetic nephropathy, the pathological role of prorenin, if any, remains unclear. Prorenin binding to the (pro)renin receptor [(p)RR] unmasks prorenin catalytic activity. We asked whether elevated prorenin could be activated at the site of renal mesangial cells (MCs) through receptor binding without being proteolytically converted to renin. Recombinant inactive rat prorenin and a mutant prorenin that is noncleavable, i.e., cannot be activated proteolytically, are produced in 293 cells. After MCs were incubated with 10(-7) M native or mutant prorenin for 6 h, cultured supernatant acquired the ability to generate angiotensin I (ANG I) from angiotensinogen, indicating both prorenins were activated. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) against the (p)RR blocked their activation. Furthermore, either native or mutant rat prorenin at 10(-7) M alone similarly and significantly induced transforming growth factor-\u03b2(1), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), and fibronectin mRNA expression, and these effects were blocked by (p)RR siRNA, but not by the ANG II receptor antagonist, saralasin. When angiotensinogen was also added to cultured MCs with inactive native or mutant prorenin, PAI-1 and fibronectin were further increased significantly compared with prorenin or mutant prorenin alone. This effect was blocked partially by treatment with (p)RR siRNA or saralasin. We conclude that prorenin binds the (p)RR on renal MCs and is activated nonproteolytically. This activation leads to increased expression of PAI-1 and transforming growth factor-\u03b2(1) via ANG II-independent and ANG II-dependent mechanisms. These data provide a mechanism by which elevated prorenin levels in diabetes may play a role in the development of diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "984": "Therapy of acute myocardial infarction (STEMI and NSTEMI) in diabetics does not principally differ from that of non-diabetic patients. Due to the higher mortality in diabetics reperfusion measures, such as direct percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), should be rapidly performed. An intensive drug treatment with thrombocyte aggregation inhibitors, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-receptor blocking agents must be carried out according to the current guidelines. An important factor is the high risk of renal failure due to the contrast dye administered during PCI in the presence of pre-existing diabetic kidney damage which should be limited to 100\u00a0ml if possible. Direct PCI should be limited to the infarcted vessel. After stabilization a comprehensive strategy to cure coronary artery disease, whether with PCI or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) should be finalized. If severe coronary 3-vessel disease is present, CABG should be favored in diabetic patients. After surviving an acute myocardial infarction differentiated metabolic monitoring is mandatory.", 
    "985": "The classic renin-angiotensin system (RAS) was initially described as a hormone system designed to mediate cardiovascular and body water regulation, with angiotensin II as its major effector. The discovery of an independent local brain RAS composed of the necessary functional components (angiotensinogen, peptidases, angiotensins, and specific receptor proteins) significantly expanded the possible physiological and pharmacological functions of this system. This review first describes the enzymatic pathways resulting in active angiotensin ligands and their interaction with AT(1), AT(2), and AT(4) receptor subtypes. Next, we discuss the classic physiologies and behaviors controlled by the RAS including cardiovascular, thirst, and sodium appetite. A final section summarizes non-classic functions and clinical conditions mediated by the brain RAS with focus on memory and Alzheimer's disease. There is no doubt that the brain RAS is an important component in the development of dementia. It also appears to play a role in normal memory consolidation and retrieval. The presently available anti-dementia drugs are proving to be reasonably ineffective, thus alternative treatment approaches must be developed. At the same time, presently available drugs must be tested for their efficacy to treat newly identified syndromes and diseases connected with the RAS. The list of non-classic physiologies and behaviors is ever increasing in both number and scope, attesting to the multidimensional influences of the RAS. Such diversity in function presents a dilemma for both researchers and clinicians. Namely, the blunting of RAS subsystems in the hopes of combating one constellation of underlying causes and disease symptoms may be counter-balanced by unanticipated and unwanted consequences to another RAS subsystem. For example, the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and AT(1) and/or AT(2) receptor blockers have shown great promise in the treatment of cardiovascular related pathologies; however, their use could negate the cerebroprotective benefits offered by this system.",

Normal blood pressure values for children and adolescents are based on age, sex, and height, and are available in standardized tables. Prehypertension is defined as a blood pressure in at least the 90th percentile, but less than the 95th percentile, for age, sex, and height, or a measurement of 120/80 mm Hg or greater. Hypertension is defined as blood pressure in the 95th percentile or greater. A secondary etiology of hypertension is much more likely in children than in adults, with renal parenchymal disease and renovascular disease being the most common. Overweight and obesity are strongly correlated with primary hypertension in children. A history and physical examination are needed for all children with newly diagnosed hypertension to help rule out underlying medical disorders. Children with hypertension should also be screened for other risk factors for cardiovascular disease, including diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia, and should be evaluated for target organ damage with a retinal examination and echocardiography. Hypertension in children is treated with lifestyle changes, including weight loss for those who are overweight or obese; a healthy, low-sodium diet; regular physical activity; and avoidance of tobacco and alcohol. Children with symptomatic hypertension, secondary hypertension, target organ damage, diabetes, or persistent hypertension despite nonpharmacologic measures should be treated with antihypertensive medications.

Analysis of photodegradation samples by LC-MS/MS revealed CP sulfonic acid as the major photodegradation product of CP. No biodegradation was observed for CP, CPDS and of the mixture resulting from photo-treatment after 64 min in CBT.

Antihypertensive agents that offer benefits that extend beyond those associated with BP reduction alone, to include tissue protective effects and effects on the vasculature, may be of benefit for many patients with increased CV risk due to comorbidities or prior history of CV events. Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers [angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs)] are guideline-recognized, highly effective antihypertensive agents that exert their BP-lowering action through different mechanisms at different levels of the RAS. Large-scale clinical studies suggest that small, between-treatment differences in BP lowering do not account for observed outcome differences between RAS blockers and other antihypertensive agents. Analysis of data from seminal clinical studies and meta-analyses identify that, controlling for effects on BP control, RAS blockers may be more effective than calcium channel blockers (CCBs) in reducing risk of myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure; ARBs may be more effective than either ACEIs or \u03b2 blockers in stroke prevention; CCBs may be more effective than RAS blockers in stroke prevention; and ARBs may be more effective than \u03b2 blockers in reducing left ventricular hypertrophy. This review considers the rationale and evidence for benefits of RAS blockade beyond BP lowering, and highlights the differences between ARBs and ACEIs, and between agents within these drug classes.", 
    "1018": "The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) has evolved in humans as one of the main physiological networks by which blood pressure and blood flow to vital organs is maintained. The RAAS has evolved to circumvent life-threatening events such as hemorrhage and starvation. Although short-term activation of this system had been well suited to counteract such catastrophes of early man, excessive chronic activation of the RAAS plays a fundamental role in the development and progression of cardiovascular disease in modern man. The RAAS is an intricate network comprising a number of major organ systems (heart, kidney, and vasculature) and signaling pathways. The main protagonists are renin, angiotensinogen (Ang), angiotensin I (Ang I), angiotensin II (Ang II), and aldosterone (Aldo). The study and delineation of each of these substances has allowed modern medicine to create targets by which cardiovascular disease can be treated. The main modulators that have been synthesized in this respect are angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), mineralocorticoid receptor blockers (MRBs), and direct renin inhibitors (DRIs). Over the past few decades, each of these substances has proven efficacious to varying degrees amongst a number of clinical settings. Additionally, there exists data for and against the use of these agents in combination. The use of these agents in combination poses a larger question conceptually: can excessive pharmacological inhibition of the RAAS lead to patient harm? This perspective will examine the concept of a neurohormonal inhibition ceiling in pertinent experimental and clinical trials.", 
    "1019": "Cardiovascular diseases are the prime cause of death in the world. The kallikrein-kinin system has been implicated in the pathophysiology of the vascular smooth muscle and cardiac dysfunctions. In recent years, numerous observations obtained from clinical and experimental models of diabetes, hypertension, cardiac failure, ischemia, myocardial infarction and left ventricular hypertrophy, have suggested that the reduced activity of the local kallikrein-kinin system may be instrumental for the induction of cardiovascular-related diseases. The cardioprotective actions of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are primarily dependent on protecting the kinin-forming components, which may cause regression of the left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertensive situations. The ability of kallikrein gene delivery to produce a wide spectrum of beneficial effects makes it an excellent candidate in treating hypertension, cardiovascular and renal diseases. In addition, stable kinin agonists may also be available in the future as therapeutic agents for cardiovascular and renal disorders.",

Beyond a simple antihypertensive effect, ACEIs have been shown to reduce the rates of myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and new-onset heart failure, and appear to have a 'blood pressure independent' effect. Given the shared mechanism of preventing action of angiotensin II, the effects of ARB therapy on reduction in cardiovascular and renal outcomes were anticipated to be equal to that of ACEI.", 
    "1030": "The role of ARBs in the prevention of MI has not only been disputed, but also has at times cast the class as a causative agent in increasing the risk of MI. This potentially deleterious effect was proposed after results from the Valsartan Antihypertensive Long-Term Use Evaluation (VALUE) trial, in which the use of valsartan (ARB) was compared with amlodipine in patients at high cardiovascular disease risk, found an excess of MIs among patients in the valsartan arm. Subsequent clinical trials and meta-analyses have largely laid to rest the question of whether ARBs contribute to cardiovascular risk.",

There was moderate-to-high positive correlation between antioxidant activity and total phenolic content of both extracts and moderate-to-high \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory activity. Although the anti-diabetic property of S.\u2009chirayita is mainly attributed to the phytochemical swerchirin present in its hexane fraction, we propose that the crude extract of this plant used in local healing also has anti-hyperglycemia potential. The crude extracts indicated the presence of three main phytochemicals mainly mangiferin, swertiamarin, and amarogentin and their derivatives.

Both prorenin and renin bind to the (pro)renin receptor (PRR) to activate Ang-II-dependent and -independent signaling cascades. Renin cleaves angiotensinogen to Ang-I, which is subsequently converted into Ang-II leading to cardiovascular and renal compensatory responses and eventually dysfunction. This initial step is blocked by renin inhibitor aliskiren, thus explaining its anti-hypertensive effect. Aliskiren is approved for the treatment of hypertension either as monotherapy or in combination with amlodipine, hydrochlorothiazide, or valsartan. Several clinical trials have suggested an organoprotective potential of aliskiren beyond its anti-hypertensive action, but the mechanism by which this might occur is less clear. Like ACEIs and ARBs, aliskiren increases plasma renin concentration; however, aliskiren reduces plasma renin activity. Intriguingly, aliskiren has additional abilities to downregulate the expression of the PRR and the AT(1) receptor, adding novel mechanistic insights to our current knowledge. Importantly, a few questions remain unresolved, such as the potential effects of aliskiren on (i) prorenin and its receptor-mediated Ang-II-independent pathways, and (ii) the signal network that comprises of PRR-associated vacuolar-H(+)-ATPase-linked Wnt/Frizzled signal transduction, including canonical-\u03b2-catenin and non-canonical Wnt-JNK-Ca(2+) signals. Discrepant outcomes in ALTITUDE study make more complex understanding aliskiren's therapeutic potential in treating cardio-renal disorders.

This contra-indication is not absolute for etanercept. In patients with milder forms of cardiac failure, TNF inhibitors can be prescribed in the absence of alternative therapy. A cardiac follow-up is necessary in this situation. Cyclosporine and tacrolimus are both nephrotoxic and hypertensive drugs. For the treatment of arterial hypertension induced by the immunosuppressive therapy, first-line recommended drugs are calcium-blockers and renin-angiotensin inhibitors.

In head-to-head comparison in 7 trials, risk of angioedema with ACE inhibitors was 2.2 times higher than with ARBs (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5 to 3.3). With ACE inhibitors and ARBs, incidence of angioedema was higher in heart failure trials compared to hypertension or coronary artery disease trials without heart failure (p <0.0001). Weighted incidence of angioedema with ACE inhibitors was 0.30% (95% CI 0.28 to 0.32) compared to 0.11% (95% CI 0.09 to 0.13) with ARBs, 0.13% (95% CI 0.08 to 0.19) with DRIs, and 0.07% with placebo (95% CI 0.05 to 0.09). In conclusion, incidence of angioedema with ARBs and DRI was <1/2 than that with ACE inhibitors and not significantly different from placebo.

ARBs did not reduce total mortality (RR 1.02 [95% CI 0.93, 1.12]) or total morbidity as measured by total hospitalisations (RR 1.00 [95% CI 0.97, 1.05]) compared with placebo.

    "1074": "In patients with symptomatic HF and systolic dysfunction or with preserved ejection fraction, ARBs compared to placebo or ACEIs do not reduce total mortality or morbidity. ARBs are better tolerated than ACEIs but do not appear to be as safe and well tolerated as placebo in terms of withdrawals due to adverse effects. Adding an ARB in combination with an ACEI does not reduce total mortality or total hospital admission but increases withdrawals due to adverse effects compared with ACEI alone.",

    "1084": "Angiotensin II (Ang II) and angiotensin-(1-7) (Ang-(1-7)) are biologically active effectors in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and have been demonstrated to have potential function in predicting cardiovascular diseases. We developed mechanism-based mathematical models to characterize the up/down-regulation of Ang II/Ang-(1-7), and the effects of perindopril on hypertension progression in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). SHR were randomly assigned to the control group (n=6) and treatment group (n=6). Rats in the treatment group received oral perindopril (5mgkg(-1)day(-1)). Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured by the tail-cuff method. Serum Ang II and Ang-(1-7) concentrations were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Three linked turnover models were developed to describe Ang II, Ang-(1-7) and SBP profiles. All parameters were estimated using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling. The results showed that Ang II, Ang-(1-7) and SBP gradually increased in the control group. These counterbalance mechanisms were reflected in the models with two feedback cycles. It was assumed that the Ang-(1-7) production rate constant (K(in_Ang17)) was stimulated by Ang II, and the Ang II output rate constant (K(out_Ang2)) reflecting Ang II degradation was stimulated by Ang-(1-7). The decrease in Ang II and increase in Ang-(1-7) were observed in rats treated with perindopril. The models described the counterbalance relationship of Ang II and Ang-(1-7) well, and provided insights into ACE inhibition using perindopril. The models could be extended to incorporate other biomarkers and the effects of various ACE inhibitors (ACEIs).",

    "1086": "We performed a pooled analysis of 20 cardiovascular morbidity-mortality trials. In each trial at least two-thirds of the patients had to be diagnosed with hypertension, according to the trial-specific definition, and randomized to treatment with an RAAS inhibitor or control treatment. The cohort included 158 998 patients (71 401 RAAS inhibitor; 87 597 control). The incidence of all-cause death was 20.9 and 23.3 per 1000 patient-years in patients randomized to RAAS inhibition and controls, respectively. Overall, RAAS inhibition was associated with a 5% reduction in all-cause mortality (HR: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.91-1.00, P= 0.032), and a 7% reduction in cardiovascular mortality (HR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.88-0.99, P= 0.018). The observed treatment effect resulted entirely from the class of ACE inhibitors, which were associated with a significant 10% reduction in all-cause mortality (HR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.84-0.97, P= 0.004), whereas no mortality reduction could be demonstrated with ARB treatment (HR: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.94-1.04, P= 0.683).

The absorbance of the Ni-CPT complex increases linearly with the increased concentration of captopril. The study also shows that ammonia has an obvious sensitizing effect on the absorbance. Based on the study, a new method for the determination of captopril is established. Experimental results show that the linear range of this method under optimum condition is 1.0-60mg/L with correlation coefficient, detection limit and precision of 0.9999, 0.31mg/L and 0.87%, respectively. The method used to determine captopril in commercial captopril tablets has a satisfactory result with the recoveries in the range of 99.0-103.6% and the relative standard deviation (RSD) in the range of 0.8-3.7%. We preliminarily study the reaction mechanism and demonstrate that the complex ratio of Ni (II) with captopril is 1:2 and the formation constant is 6.3\u00d710(9).",

    "1104": "Diabetic patients carry a four- to five-fold increased risk of heart failure. Hyperglycaemia plays a central role in the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Diabetic cardiomyopathy represents a distinct structural and functional disorder of the myocardium characterized by cardiac hypertrophy and an increased myocardial stiffness. At an early stage, diabetic cardiomyopathy is manifested by diastolic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. In some patients, diastolic dysfunction may progress to heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and result in overt systolic heart failure. Diastolic dysfunction can accurately be diagnosed by echocardiography and BNP measurement in daily clinical practice. Early treatment is prognostically important. Optimal control of blood glucose levels and blood pressure is beneficial. So far metformin is the only antidiabetic agent not associated with harm in diabetic patients with heart failure. Incretin-based therapies potentially provide cardiovascular benefits. ACE inhibitors, angiotensin-1 receptor antagonists and beta-blockers should be preferred in heart failure therapy.",

As outcome indicators we choose in-hospital mortality, cognitive function evaluated by Hodkinson Abbreviated Mental Test (HAMT), and functional status evaluated by activity daily living (ADL). Indicators of a good outcome were: no in-hospital mortality, HAMT >6 and 0 ADL impaired. Patients with a good outcome showed a higher rate of in-hospital treatment with ACE-inhibitors, calcium-channel blockers and a lower rate of pre-treatment with heparin.",
