    "0": "Evidence for angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) on isolated human glomeruli was furnished by specific binding of tritium-labeled ramiprilat, a potent inhibitor of ACE. 3H-ramiprilat bound to isolated glomeruli, depending on time and temperature displaying a KD of 3.8 nmol/l and a Bmax of 853 fmol/mg protein. Specific binding represented more than 90% of total binding. Dissociation occurred rapidly after dilution of the sample with incubation buffer or after addition of an excess of unlabeled inhibitor. Binding of 3H-ramiprilat was also inhibited by increasing concentrations of enalaprilat, another ACE-inhibitor or by preincubation of the glomeruli with polyclonal antibodies against ACE. ACE is a zinc-containing enzyme. Addition of EGTA to the assay, which chelates zinc ions, completely inhibited binding. This inhibitory effect of EGTA was reversed by divalent Zn2+ and Ca2+ ions but not by magnesium. Binding of 3H-ramiprilat to isolated glomeruli was maximal when the pH of the assay medium was brought to pH 8. In conclusion, the binding of 3H-ramiprilat to isolated human glomeruli is specific and resembles the characteristics which have been found earlier for enzyme activity of ACE. Thus, binding of 3H-ramiprilat to isolated glomeruli can be assumed to be directed to ACE.", 
    "1": "Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) showed lower brain ANP binding density when compared with normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. In the WKY, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril (25 mg/kg, p.o. for 14 days), decreased the number of ANP binding sites selectively in the subfornical organ and area postrema. Conversely, enalapril increased ANP binding density in the SHR, but only in the area postrema. Enalapril has central effects on ANP binding sites, specific to the circumventricular organs.", 
    "2": "In diabetic patients, it has been suggested that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors may be associated with unexplained hypoglycaemic episodes. Such a side effect may limit the use of these drugs in diabetic hypertensive patients. Ten insulin-dependent diabetic patients mean age 38.4 +/- 13.1 years, mean diabetes duration 10.3 +/- 6.6 years (m +/- SD) were selected on the basis of good glycaemic control: HbA1: 7.6 +/- 0.9 per cent (upper limit of normal value less than 7.5 per cent) on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion. In a double blind study, they were randomly and successively allocated for a 3 months period to enalapril 20 mg daily or placebo. Before treatment, after enalapril and placebo, mean blood glucose values, HbA1, daily insulin dosage were recorded as well as the number of clinical and biological (less than 3 mmol/l) hypoglycaemic episodes. Peripheral insulin sensitivity was assessed by euglycaemic insulin clamp technique. Compared to placebo, enalapril did not induce any modification of daily insulin dosage, glycaemic control. The incidence of hypoglycaemic episodes was similar. Neither peripheral insulin sensitivity was modified by enalapril. In the conditions of this study, enalapril did not interfere with glycaemic control in insulin-dependent diabetics in good metabolic control.", 
    "3": "In 3 patients with severe cardiac failure high dose therapy with the ACE inhibitor enalapril was instituted during a state of extracellular volume depletion. Severe arterial hypotension with reversible renal insufficiency developed in all the patients. In two the hypovolemia was induced by diuretic treatment and in one by an acute infection with diarrhea. The latter patient also developed life-threatening hyperkalemia with cardiac arrest since he was also receiving spironolactone and potassium supplements. These cases demonstrate that ACE inhibitors should not be instituted during extracellular volume depletion and their initial dosage should be low. The dangerous combination of ACE inhibitors with spironolactone and potassium supplements should be avoided wherever possible.", 
    "4": "This study investigated the effects of hypoxia adaptation (10% O2 for 4 days) on rat lung angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) content before and after hyperoxia exposure (>95% O2 for 2 days). The rationale for this investigation was that hyperoxia exposure decreases lung ACE, while hypoxia adaptation produces tolerance (improved survival) to oxygen toxicity in rats. Rats were exposed to air, hypoxia, hyperoxia alone, or hypoxia followed immediately by hyperoxia. The lungs were then excised and perfused in vitro at 12 ml/min with buffer. Lung ACE content was quantitated by measuring the single-pass binding of an iodinated ACE inhibitor,(125)I-MK 351A, a derivative of lisinopril. We showed previously that(125)I-MK 351A binding correlates quantitatively with ACE activity in lung homogenates and isolated, perfused lungs. Lung internal surface area was estimated by measuring the mean alveolar diameter of 5\u00b5m hematoxylin and eosin sections from lungs fixed in inflation (25 cmH2O transpulmonary pressure). Hypoxia adaptation per se had no effect on(125)I-MK 351A binding or estimated alveolar surface area, while hyperoxia exposure caused a significant decrease in both(125)I-MK 351A binding and alveolar surface area. These hyperoxia-induced decreases were prevented partially by hypoxia adaptation, indicating a protective effect on both ACE content and surface area.(125)I-MK 351A binding in isolated perfused lungs changed in parallel with histologically estimated surface area. These results indicate that hypoxia preadaptation minimizes the oxygen-induced decrease in lung microvascular ACE content.", 
    "5": "The degradation kinetics, products, and mechanisms of RS-10029 (2), 2-[2-[(1-carboxylic acid)-3-phenylpropyl]amino-1-oxopropyl] 6,7-dimethoxy- 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid (S,S,S), in aqueous solutions from pH 1 to pH 13 were studied at 50, 60, and 80 degrees C. Pseudo-first-order kinetics were obtained throughout the entire pH range studied, and the log(rate)-pH profile reflected four kinetic processes (ko, k'o, k\"o, and kOH) as well as the three pka's of 2. Excellent mass balance (greater than 96%) was obtained for the four major products 3-6 throughout the entire pH range studied even though four other minor products can be detected by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). At pH 8.0 and below, intramolecular aminolysis leading to diketopiperazine (DKP) 5 accounted for greater than 65% of the neutral or water-catalyzed (ko and k'o) processes. Amide hydrolysis leading to products 3 and 4 and epimerization of DKP 5 to the (R,S,S) diastereomer 6 accounted for the remaining 35% of the neutral or water catalyzed processes. At pH values above 8.0, DKP 5 formation begins to decrease as the amide hydrolysis increases so that both mechanisms account for the neutral or water-catalyzed k\"o process. Above pH 11.0 amide hydrolysis dominates and is responsible for the specific base-catalyzed (kOH) process. The four minor products detected by HPLC are two diastereomers (7 and 8) of 2 and the two diastereomers (9 and 10) of the DKP 5. The stability results between 2 and its ester prodrug (1) are compared.", 
    "6": "The interactions of nifedipine with sodium restriction, diuretics and enalapril were studied using a 2 x 2 factorial design. Nifedipine lowered blood pressure to a greater extent than sodium restriction or hydrochlorothiazide. With both of these therapies there was a negative interactive term, which indicated that their combination had no greater effect than the use of nifedipine alone. Enalapril and nifedipine lowered blood pressure by 10 +/- 2/8 +/- 1 and 11 +/- 3/8 +/- 1 mmHg, respectively. The combination lowered blood pressure by 32 +/- 3/24 +/- 2 mmHg. The reasons for these negative and positive interactions are not clear, but may relate to interactions that regulate the availability of calcium for initiation of contraction in smooth muscle cells of the arterioles.", 
    "7": "The acyl lysinamido phosphonates represent a novel class of angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Representatives of this class produce 50% inhibition of purified rabbit lung ACE at concentrations less than 8 nmol/l. After intravenous and oral administration to normotensive rats the phosphonates inhibited an angiotensin I pressor response by 50% at doses less than or equal to enalapril (oral studies) or its free acid, MK-422 (intravenous studies); however, the duration of effect was much longer after the phosphonates. In conscious cynomolgus monkeys, representatives of the phosphonate class showed greater inhibition of an angiotensin I pressor response and for a much longer period of time than enalapril, fosinopril and lisinopril. Similarly, in sodium-depleted monkeys the blood pressure lowering effects of enalapril, lisinopril and fosinopril were of short duration compared with those of the phosphonates. It is concluded that the acyl lysinamido phosphonates represent a potent and long-acting class of ACE inhibitors in vitro and in vivo.", 
    "8": "We performed experiments in the two-kidney, one clip Goldblatt hypertensive dog to see whether angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition could improve the sensitivity of hippurate renography in detecting renal artery stenosis. Ten dogs on a sodium-restricted diet were studied before and after induction of a renal artery stenosis. In the absence of renal artery stenosis nine dogs showed normal renograms before ACE inhibition, and one was false positive. During ACE inhibition all 10 renograms were normal. With a renal artery stenosis 50% of the renograms were false negative, whereas a 100% sensitivity was reached during ACE inhibition. The alterations induced by the ACE inhibition on the renograms were not related to changes in renal blood flow. In conclusion, ACE inhibition markedly improved the sensitivity of hippurate renography in the two-kidney, one clip dog.", 
    "9": "Non-invasive ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (Spacelabs 5200) was carried out before and 3 months after treatment with perindopril, a new angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor given at 4-8 mg once a day in the morning. Twenty-one patients with sustained essential uncomplicated hypertension were analysed. The 24-h mean values for systolic and diastolic blood pressure, their standard deviations (absolute variability) and their coefficients of variation were compared before and after the administration of perindopril, using a two-way analysis of variance. In order to determine whether perindopril could decrease systolic more than diastolic pressure, we evaluated the relationship between systolic and diastolic blood pressure as recorded by the Spacelabs monitor. The correlation coefficient between these two parameters was calculated before (r = 0.82) and after (r = 0.76) treatment. Comparison between the corresponding slopes indicated that, at any given value of diastolic blood pressure, systolic blood pressure was lower after than before the administration of perindopril.", 
    "10": "Acute or chronic inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity in normotensive rats may increase, decrease or cause no change in renal blood flow. Since renal blood flow and the glomerular filtration rate are highly dependent on protein intake, we investigated the question of whether the reported differences in the renal effects of ACE inhibition can be explained by the level of food intake. Glomerular filtration and arterial pressure were measured in conscious, chronically catheterized rats, which were either fed or fasted for 24 h on the day of experiment. In the control group, the glomerular filtration rate was 45% higher in fed than in fasted rats, while blood pressure and plasma renin concentration were unchanged. In experimental animals, given daily 1-mg/kg doses of the ACE inhibitor perindopril, the glomerular filtration rate was the same in both fed and fasted animals and comparable to the values of fasted control animals. Mean blood pressure was reduced from 113 to 91 mmHg by perindopril. It is concluded that chronic ACE inhibition prevents postprandial hyperfiltration and decreases the blood pressure of fed or fasted rats by 20 mmHg, but does not affect renal function in fasted rats.", 
    "11": "Renal haemodynamics and natriuresis were studied before and 6 h after oral intake of perindopril (8 mg) in eight hypertensive patients without renal failure. The patients were then treated with perindopril (8 mg per day) and renal haemodynamics were measured on the fifth day, 6 h after the morning intake. Sodium intake was controlled during the study (100 mmol sodium per day). Renal blood flow and the glomerular filtration rate were measured by the clearance method using 131I-hippuran and 125I-iothalamate, respectively. Mean blood pressure decreased from 135 to 110 after 6 h, and was 118 mmHg on the fifth day (P less than 0.001, respectively). Renal vascular resistance decreased significantly after acute drug intake from 0.19 to 0.15 arbitrary units (P less than 0.001) and on the fifth day to 0.16 arbitrary units (P less than 0.001). Renal blood flow rose from 708 to 723 after 6 h, and to 750 ml/min per 1.73 m2 on the fifth day but the change was no significant. There was no alteration in the glomerular filtration rate so that the filtration fraction decreased from 0.27 to 0.26 (after 6 h), and to 0.25 on the fifth day (P less than 0.02). Natriuresis increased after the first intake between the first and tenth hours. On the fifth day, maximum natriuresis was observed between the fourth and sixth hours. Perindopril caused strong renal vasodilation after the first intake and during the following days, with no change in the glomerular filtration rate. There was a significant decrease in the filtration fraction, indicating efferent, as well as afferent, arteriolar vasodilation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "12": "The pharmacokinetics of long-acting angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors show features which are consistent with saturable binding of the drugs to ACE. Their pharmacokinetics may thus be used to assess the extent and affinity of plasma and tissue binding of the drug. For 16 subjects, a hierarchy of pharmacokinetic models was fitted by weighted, least squares, non-linear regression analysis to the concentration-time profile during and after an intravenous infusion of S-9780. A one-compartment model which included saturable tissue and plasma binding gave the best description of the data. The median parameter estimates from this model suggested that total binding capacity for drug was 333 micrograms, of which 62% was in tissue sites, and that the total plasma concentration of drug at half maximum saturation was 6.3 ng/ml. Thus the extent and affinity of ACE inhibitor binding to tissue ACE may be estimated from appropriate analysis of pharmacokinetic data in man.", 
    "13": "Blood pressure, forearm arterial haemodynamics and echocardiographic parameters were studied in patients with sustained essential hypertension before and after administration of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor perindopril for 1 year. Perindopril significantly reduced blood pressure and at the same time increased brachial artery blood flow, diameter and compliance. As part of the haemodynamic investigation, a 5-min period of wrist occlusion was performed. Blood flow velocity decreased significantly to the same extent with perindopril and with placebo, but the corresponding reductions in arterial diameter were smaller with perindopril than with placebo, indicating that the increase in diameter following perindopril could not be explained solely on the basis of a flow-dependent dilation. After 3 months, treatment was stopped for 4 weeks. Blood pressure and forearm arterial haemodynamics returned towards baseline values. However, cardiac mass, which was significantly decreased after perindopril administration, remained decreased 4 weeks after cessation of treatment. In seven responder patients, perindopril was continued as sole therapy for 8 months. Arterial compliance remained elevated and cardiac mass diminished. The study showed that the arterial changes caused by perindopril involved a drug-related relaxation of arterial smooth muscle and that there was a differential response in cardiac and arterial changes following long-term treatment.", 
    "14": "Male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were treated from 4 to 24 weeks of age with perindopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, in doses of 0.4 and 0.8 mg/kg per day; we investigated the effects of these doses on blood pressure during and after withdrawal of treatment, and on the structural and functional characteristics of the resistance vessels. During treatment, mean blood pressure was maintained close to the level of normotensive control Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). At the age of 24 weeks, a resistance vessel segment was taken as a biopsy from the third branch of the superior mesenteric artery, and the structural and functional parameters were determined using an isometric myograph. Taken together with previous results the measurements showed that perindopril had a dose-dependent effect on both blood pressure and resistance vessel media thickness. Treatment was then withdrawn. Twelve weeks later, the mean blood pressure in both groups was still significantly reduced compared to that of age-matched SHR controls, but was no longer dose-related, nor was it related to the resistance vessel media thickness at age 24 weeks. The results suggest that the continuing reduction in blood pressure after withdrawal of treatment with perindopril may not be directly related to the drug's effect on resistance vessel structure.", 
    "15": "The effects of chronic therapy, using an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (S9490-3 perindopril, 1 mg/kg), on the mechanical and structural properties of large arteries were studied in two-kidney, one clip (2K, 1C) Goldblatt hypertensive and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) compared with matched normotensive Wistar and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) animals. The treatment was carried out for 1 month in Goldblatt-hypertensive rats and 3 months in SHR, i.e. for 1 month after blood pressure was normalized. At the end of the treatment period the passive mechanical properties of the isolated carotid artery were measured in situ. Carotid compliance was calculated from the pressure-volume relationship between 50 and 250 mmHg. Morphological parameters of the aortic wall, including medial thickness, nucleus density and elastin and collagen content, were recorded by an automated morphometric system. Renal and essential hypertension were associated with a shift of the passive pressure-volume relationship in the carotid, corresponding to a decrease in arterial compliance. The passive mechanical properties of the carotid were normalized by ACE inhibitor treatment in renovascular hypertensive rats but remained unchanged in chronically treated SHR. The ACE inhibitor completely reversed the medial hypertrophy in Goldblatt-hypertensive rats but the reversal of medial hypertrophy was incomplete in SHR. The elastin to collagen ratio in the aortic media was significantly increased by 3 months of treatment with the ACE inhibitor in the SHR and WKY groups but remained unchanged in the Goldblatt-hypertensive and Wistar rats treated for 1 month.", 
    "16": "Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, in comparison with other antihypertensive agents, offer unquestionable advantages in the treatment of hypertension. They do not alter cerebral blood flow. They improve cardiac function by decreasing postload, by preventing left ventricular hypertrophy and by decreasing myocardial excitability which engenders dysrhythmias. They increase compliance of large arteries and correct renal hemodynamic disturbances in hypertensive patients. Finally, they do not cause metabolic disturbances involving serum blood sugar, uric acid or lipids, and they help conserve potassium in patients on diuretics.", 
    "17": "Fischer 344 rats show no spontaneous preference for isotonic sodium chloride (NaCl) solution. These experiments indicate, however, that a strong appetite for this solution may be induced by various methods, including adrenalectomy, administration of a mineralocorticoid hormone, acute depletion of sodium, and treatment with inhibitors of the angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE). These treatments were also shown to produce the expected changes in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which thus appears to be involved in the induction of an appetite for NaCl solution in this strain of rat. The intakes of NaCl induced in the Fischer 344 rats by these experimental paradigms are less than those that have been reported in either Sprague-Dawley or Wistar strains in similar paradigms. In the case of sodium depletion, the intake of NaCl solution by Fischer 344 rats appears to be more closely related to the deficit than in the other two strains. Thus, the Fischer 344 strain of rats may be a particularly good model for studies of need-related sodium appetite.", 
    "18": "A novel method for the synthesis of histargin and its analogs is described. It includes two kinds of N-alkylation reactions that prevent the formation of side products. The inhibition of enzymes by these compounds was also measured. Some of the compounds strongly inhibited carboxypeptidase B, carboxypeptidase A, carboxypeptidase N (kininase I), and angiotensin converting enzyme.", 
    "19": "1. The spinal sympathetic outflow (C7-T2) of pithed male Wistar rats was electrically stimulated (30-50 V, 0.5 ms, 0.1-1.0 Hz) and heart rate and arterial blood pressure were recorded. D-Tubocurarine (1 mg/kg) and atropine (1 mg/kg) were administered intravenously (i.v.) to reduce voluntary and parasympathetic nerve activity. 2. Angiotensin II (0.39-3.4 micrograms/kg per min) was infused at a rate which caused a sustained rise in diastolic blood pressure of at least 25 mmHg but which did not alter basal heart rate. 3. Chronotropic responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation were not affected by infusion of angiotensin II, and were also unaltered by pretreatment of rats with indomethacin (5 mg/kg, i.v.) 10 min prior to commencement of stimulation. 4. These results suggest that positive chronotropic responses to cardiac sympathetic nerve stimulation in pithed rats are not affected by increased angiotensin II levels. Indomethacin had no effect, which indicates that cyclo-oxygenase products were not involved in modulation of chronotropic responses to cardiac sympathetic nerve stimulation.", 
    "20": "We studied sexual dysfunction induced by antihypertensive agents in 156 male hypertensive patients. The antihypertensive agents were: trichloromethiazide, 2-4 mg; atenolol, 50-100 mg; captopril 37.5-75 mg; and slow release nifedipine 40-80 mg, administered every day for 1 year after a 2-4-week placebo period. Sexual dysfunction was checked by both a self-reporting questionnaire and a test for serum sex hormones. In the self-reporting questionnaire, the following items were requested: reduction of sexual desire, problems in obtaining and maintaining an erection, problems in ejaculation and the number of occasions of sexual intercourse. The sex hormones measured were testosterone, follicular stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone and oestradiol. During the placebo period, 5% of the hypertensive patients complained of some sexual disturbance without any significant changes in the plasma levels of the sex hormones. In the short term (1-4 weeks) after the initiation of the antihypertensive therapy, all antihypertensive agents except captopril caused sexual dysfunction. Patients on atenolol or trichloromethiazide complained of every item listed. Those on slow-release nifedipine complained mainly about problems in ejaculation. Serum levels of both testosterone and follicular stimulating hormone were significantly decreased while there was mild elevation of oestradiol in patients on atenolol. In the long term (1 year), only patients taking atenolol experienced sexual dysfunction and mild reduction of serum levels of testosterone. Our findings show that first-line antihypertensive agents have different effects on sexual function and that only captopril may have some advantages over the other agents in terms of the quality of sexual life.", 
    "21": "Enhanced vascular permeability in tumor tissue has profound pathological consequences in tumor biology. However, details of the mechanism involved are not clear. The present work on tumor vascular permeability has led to the following three findings. (i) Ascitic tumor fluid contained kinin (about 1-40 ng/ml), which is known to enhance vascular permeability and induce pain in vivo. (ii) Kinin is generated via the kallikrein-dependent cascade in the ascitic tumor fluid. By blocking this kinin-generating cascade with Kunitz-type soybean trypsin inhibitor the formation of ascites was suppressed. (iii) Blocking of kinin-degrading enzymes (kininases I and II) by an appropriate kininase inhibitor (e.g., captopril) may result in increased permeability, leading to accumulation of the ascitic fluid. This phenomenon was verified by an about 1.2-1.5 fold increase in leakage of 51Cr-labeled bovine serum albumin into the ascites when kininase inhibitors had been administered orally 30 min before intravenous administration of the bovine serum albumin.", 
    "22": "1. The influence of angiotensin II (AII) on resting blood pressure and on sympathetic nerve-mediated pressor responses in the pithed rat was investigated either by inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system or by infusing AII. 2. Plasma AII levels in the pithed rat were approximately 20 fold higher than in normotensive rats. 3. Infusion of a subpressor dose of AII (50 ng kg-1 min-1) had no effect on sympathetic nerve mediated pressor responses but a pressor dose of AII, (200 ng kg-1 min-1) facilitated nerve-mediated pressor responses. 4. The angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, teprotide, and the AII-receptor antagonist, saralasin, lowered the diastolic blood pressure and attenuated sympathetic nerve-mediated pressor responses. There was no difference in the effects of teprotide at 1 mg kg-1 and 10 mg kg-1. Infusion of sodium nitroprusside at concentrations producing a fall in diastolic blood pressure of similar magnitude to that produced by teprotide and saralasin significantly attenuated nerve-mediated pressor responses. 5. After teprotide, AII 50 mg kg-1 min-1 increased diastolic blood pressure. The inhibitory effect of teprotide on nerve-mediated pressor responses was antagonized by this infusion of AII only if the rats were pretreated with the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, flurbiprofen. 6. It is concluded that AII is a major determinant of vascular tone in the pithed rat and that inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system attenuates sympathetic nerve-mediated pressor responses at least in part through the fall in blood pressure per se. The demonstration of this is complicated by an excessive release of vasodilator prostaglandins possibly due to the infused AII. Since plasma All levels are high, the effects of blockade of the renin-angiotensin system will be exaggerated and so the importance of All as a modulator of sympathetic responses will be overestimated in this model.", 
    "23": "1. An increase in plasma chloride concentration (PC1) decreases renal blood flow (RBF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and inhibits the intrarenal release of renin and angiotensin II (AII). Captopril was administered to indomethacin-treated dogs to assess the role of AII independent of prostaglandins (PGs) in the haemodynamic response to hyperchloraemia. Studies were performed on kidneys that were denervated by autotransplantation. 2. Anaesthetized greyhounds received an intrarenal infusion of 0.616 M-sodium acetate, which was changed to 0.616 M-NaCl (hyperchloraemia). These infusions increased the plasma sodium and osmolality at the experimental kidney by 7-11% throughout but increased the PCl during the hypertonic NaCl infusions only (122 +/- 3 to 136 +/- 3 mM). 3. In vehicle-treated dogs (n = 8), hyperchloraemia reduced the GFR (1.4 +/- 0.1 to 1.0 +/- 0.1 ml min-1 kg-1; P less than 0.05) and the RBF (13.0 +/- 1.4 to 8.3 +/- 0.6 ml min-1 kg-1; P less than 0.01); these changes were reversible on return to the 0.616 M-sodium acetate infusion. Hyperchloraemia reduced the release of AII into renal lymph (2.5 +/- 0.9 to 1.2 +/- 0.4 pg min-1 kg-1; P less than 0.01). 4. Indomethacin (0.6 mg kg-1 and 0.2 mg kg-1 h-1 intrarenally; n = 4) blunted (P less than 0.05) the Cl--induced fall in RBF (10.4 +/- 1.1 to 8.2 +/- 0.6 ml min-1 kg-1) without changing significantly the fall in GFR or the release of AII into renal lymph.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "24": "The present study was designed to investigate the involvement of the renal nerve in glucocorticoid hypertension and to assess the role of the renin-angiotensin system in dexamethasone-induced hypertension. The elevated blood pressure in dexamethasone treated rats showing a significant increase in plasma renin concentration (PRC) and activity (PRA) was attenuated dose-dependently by the angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. Bilateral renal denervation caused a partial decrease in the elevated blood pressure, abolished the increased PRC and PRA, and reduced the dose-dependent decrease in blood pressure with ACE inhibition in dexamethasone treated rats. Although the reduction in body weight and increases in urine volume, urinary sodium excretion and hematocrit were clearly seen following dexamethasone administration, dexamethasone-treated renal denervated rats showed the same degree of change in any of the variables as dexamethasone-treated sham-operated rats. Thus, our results indicate that the stimulation of the renin-angiotensin system through the activation of the renal nerve may be partially responsible for the dexamethasone-induced high blood pressure and, therefore, bilateral renal denervation reduces, partially but significantly, the elevated blood pressure, suggesting that the attenuation of oversecretion of renin contributes to the lowering of the blood pressure.", 
    "25": "The magnitude of captopril hypotensive effect, and variation in renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and kallikrein-kinin parameters were examined in patients with advanced essential hypertension in the presence of normal and low plasma renin activity. The demonstrated differences in the patterns of arterial BP, renin-angiotensin and kallikrein-kinin change have suggested that low-renin essential hypertension is resistant to captopril in most cases.", 
    "26": "The intestinal absorption mechanism of captopril was investigated in fasted rats using a single-pass perfusion method. Captopril and captopril disulfide were analyzed by HPLC. A modified boundary-layer solution was applied to determine the apparent intestinal wall permeabilities (Pw*). The results indicated that captopril is very permeable in the small intestine but not in the colon, and the permeability in the small intestine is both pH and concentration dependent. The estimated parameters for the carrier are: Km*, 6 mM; Jmax*, 12 mM; and Pc*, 2. There is also a significant passive component to captopril absorption in the small intestine. Furthermore, the intestinal permeability of captopril was significantly decreased by the withdrawal of sodium from the perfusate (3 times), and the addition of 85 mM of gly-gly (2.5 times), 15 mM of gly-pro (4 times), dipeptide mixture (4.5 times), 0.5 mM of 2,4-dinitrophenol (4 times), and 10 mM of cephradine (6 times). This is the first demonstration that an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor is at least in part transported by a carrier-mediated process in the intestine via the peptide carrier system. In addition, the results showed that the peptide carrier system can transport a substrate without a \"N\" terminal nitrogen atom.", 
    "27": "The extent and the duration of the antihypertensive effect of captopril, given once a day at a dose of 50 mg, compared with placebo and with the 100 mg once daily dose was studied in 30 mild or moderate uncomplicated essential hypertensives (mean +/- s.e.m. age 52.0 +/- 1.5 years), who responded (mean blood pressure decrease greater than 10%) to a single oral dose (12.5 mg) of captopril. According to a randomized, double-blind, crossover design, they were given 50 mg captopril four times a day, 100 mg captopril four times a day or matched placebo for 1 month. At the end of each treatment period blood pressure and heart rate were measured every 30 min from 3 h before to 2 h after the last dose. Although the heart rate did not change, mean blood pressure after the 50- and 100-mg doses of captopril was consistently significantly (P less than or equal to 0.05) lower than after placebo. The hypotensive effect peaked at the second hour and was still significant 24 h after dosing without any significant differences between the 50- and the 100-mg doses. These findings indicate that captopril, given chronically once a day at a dose of 50 mg to mild to moderate hypertensive responders, exerts its hypotensive effect up to 24 h and that doubling the dose does not increase either the extent or the duration of its action.", 
    "28": "The role of central pressor mechanisms in the maintenance of blood pressure in six hypertensive patients with angiographically proven unilateral renal artery stenosis was investigated by studying the haemodynamic and hormonal responses before and after central sympathetic blockade with clonidine. To assess the dependency of blood pressure on the direct effects of angiotensin II, the same patients were studied on a separate occasion after administration of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, captopril. There was a substantial fall in blood pressure after administration of clonidine with a smaller fall after captopril. Clonidine-induced hypotension was accompanied by a fall in cardiac output, through a reduction in the stroke volume and heart rate. Forearm vascular resistance was unchanged. There was a selective decrease in digital skin vascular resistance and plasma noradrenaline, indicating reduced sympathetic activity. Plasma renin activity and aldosterone levels did not fall. After administration of captopril, there was a fall in cardiac output due to a fall in the stroke volume but not in the heart rate. Forearm vascular resistance, digital skin vascular resistance and plasma noradrenaline were unchanged. Plasma renin activity rose and plasma aldosterone fell. We conclude that in our hypertensive patients with renal artery stenosis, clonidine lowered blood pressure by a reduction in central sympathetic activity independently of renin suppression. In these patients captopril had minimal hypotensive effects, indicating a smaller role for the direct vascular effects of angiotensin II.", 
    "29": "The systemic and renal responses to normal volume expansion (1800 ml isotonic saline infused over 3 h) were assessed in 23 patients with essential hypertension after 4-7 days' administration of a placebo or the calcium antagonist nitrendipine (20 mg three times a day) or the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril (50 pressure mg three times a day). Each drug treatment was associated with a fall in blood pressure of the same magnitude. Treatment with captopril was associated with a significant volume dependence of blood pressure and a blunting of the exaggerated natriuresis of hypertension (71 +/- 16 on placebo and 47 +/- 12 mmol/3 h on captopril; P less than 0.01). Treatment with nitrendipine did not affect the change in blood pressure associated with volume expansion, but significantly enhanced the natriuretic response to volume expansion (61 +/- 8 on placebo and 90 +/- 16 mmol/3 h on nitrendipine; P less than 0.01). No alterations in baseline or volume expansion-induced changes in the glomerular filtration rate or in plasma renin activity were observed during treatment with nitrendipine. Therefore, the exaggerated natriuresis of essential hypertension was blunted by the ACE inhibitor and enhanced by the calcium antagonist, despite a similar reduction in pre-expansion arterial pressure.", 
    "30": "Recent experimental and clinical data have suggested that angiotension converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may decrease glomerular proteinuria by specific effects on the glomerulus. We studied a group of 15 adult patients with chronic renal failure and proteinuria due to various glomerulopathies. These patients had mild to moderate hypertension which was effectively controlled with conventional antihypertensive therapy. We then treated the patients with captopril, maintaining a similar dietary protein and salt intake. After 6 months of study, proteinuria was reduced significantly without reduction in inulin or para-aminohippurate clearance. This supports the concept that captopril may have salutary effects on the glomerulus, independently of its effect on systemic blood pressure.", 
    "31": "The case of a young woman presenting with a renin-secreting soft tissue sarcoma is described. The primary extrarenal tumour as well as metastatic disease were associated with severe hypertension and both required surgical treatment. The location of these rare malignant tumours and their association with renin-dependent hypertension is discussed. In cases of this type, reappearance of hypertension suggests tumour recurrence.", 
    "32": "Erythrocyte sodium, potassium and water contents and sodium fluxes were measured in both normotensive and hypertensive patients with either insulin dependent or non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. Hypertensive patients were studied again after two months' treatment with captopril. There were no differences in erythrocyte ion contents or concentrations but sodium fluxes may have been lower in insulin dependent patients and in hypertensive patients. The most marked erythrocyte defects associated with hypertension were low erythrocyte water content and increased potassium concentration in non-insulin dependent diabetic patients. Treatment with captopril caused an increase in erythrocyte water and a decrease in ion content and concentration. In non-insulin dependent diabetic patients, who had the greatest increases in erythrocyte water and falls in potassium concentration, frusemide-sensitive sodium-potassium co-transport activity was reduced. The reduction in blood pressure with captopril treatment was related to the initial erythrocyte sodium content.", 
    "33": "In a randomized double-blind multicentre study the efficacy (lowering diastolic blood pressure less than or equal to 90 mmHg) of urapidil, a postsynaptic alpha-blocker with central action, was compared with that of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril. Two hundred and ninety-five essential hypertensives (World Health Organization stages I-II; 140 males, 155 females; mean age 51 years) were treated for 12 weeks with either 30-90 mg urapidil twice a day or 12.5-50mg captopril twice a day. Supine blood pressure values (mmHg, means +/- s.d.) at the end of the 12-week treatment period fell in the urapidil group (n = 142) from 175 +/- 19/103 +/- 6 to 154 +/- 17/89 +/- 9 (P less than 0.001), in the captopril group (n = 153) from 175 +/- 19/103 +/- 6 to 154 +/- 19/90 +/- 9 (P less than 0.001), representing responder rates of 62% for urapidil and 58% for captopril. The results demonstrate that two antihypertensive medications with different modes of action control blood pressure with equal efficacy. A dose decrease was possible in 20% of each group, but a dose increase was necessary in 39% of the urapidil and 44% of the captopril group.", 
    "34": "Angiotensin II (Ang II), an important peptide in cardiovascular physiology, is the product of enzymatic processing of angiotensinogen which involves two proteolytic steps carried out by renin and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) sequentially. This system, which plays an important role in cardiorenal homeostasis, is conventionally considered an endocrine system. Increasing evidence supports the existence of this biochemical cascade in many tissues, in addition to its presence in the circulation. The molecular demonstration of tissue renin and angiotensinogen gene expressions suggest that the presence of this system is due, at least in part, to local synthesis. These observations have led to the hypothesis that locally generated angiotensin may be important in the regulation of individual tissue function, in addition to its circulating counterpart. This emerging concept may be important in providing an additional understanding of the role of renin angiotensin in cardiovascular physiology and in the response to pharmacological inhibitors of this system.", 
    "35": "The present study examines the influence of two angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, perindopril and captopril, on renal plasma flow and on autoregulation of glomerular filtration in anaesthetized rats during reduction of renal perfusion pressure to 100, 90 and 80 mmHg. Groups 1 and 3 had a normal sodium intake (4 mmol/kg per day), while groups 2 and 4 were sodium depleted (0.5 mmol/kg per day) for 10 days. Renal perfusion pressure was measured before and after ACE inhibition in all groups. Groups 1 and 2 were given perindopril (0.3 mg/kg) and groups 3 and 4 were given captopril (3.0 mg/kg) intravenously. When renal perfusion pressure was reduced in group 1 following ACE inhibition with perindopril, the glomerular filtration rate remained unaltered. In group 3, captopril abolished autoregulation of the glomerular filtration rate, which decreased from 1.01 +/- 0.03 to 0.60 +/- 0.03 ml/min. Similarly, reduction in renal perfusion pressure was associated with an unaltered glomerular filtration rate in group 2, but in group 4 the glomerular filtration rate fell more significantly, from 0.89 +/- 0.06 to to 0.19 +/- 0.3 ml/min. Renal plasma flow decreased significantly in groups 1 and 3 during the renal perfusion pressure changes, both before and during ACE inhibition, but in groups 3 and 4 it remained relatively stable. These results indicate that ACE inhibition with captopril alters the normal autoregulation of the glomerular filtration rate, presumably by blocking the angiotensin II (Ang II) efferent arteriole vasoconstriction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "36": "Removal of the facilitating effect of angiotensin II on sympathetic cardiovascular influences may enhance the antihypertensive effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors but may also disturb reflexes involved in blood pressure homeostasis. To test this hypothesis in essential hypertensive subjects, the forearm vasomotor response to cardiopulmonary receptor deactivation (lower body negative pressure) was studied before and after acute or prolonged administration of captopril at doses capable of lowering blood pressure and blocking the formation of angiotensin II. After either acute or prolonged captopril administration there was less response (i.e. forearm vasoconstriction) than in the no-drug state. However, in the same subjects, another reflex response to cardiopulmonary receptor deactivation, the increase in plasma renin activity, was not blunted by the drug. Furthermore, the other major reflex responsible for blood pressure homeostasis, the arterial baroreflex, was left unchanged or was even favoured by administration of clinically effective doses of captopril. This finding applied to both the heart rate and the blood pressure modulating ability of the reflex (vasoactive drug and neck chamber techniques, respectively). Thus, reflex control of circulation may be adversely affected by ACE inhibition. However, this does not include all reflex targets and at least one major reflex is preserved following this pharmacological intervention. This may explain why our patients showed no orthostatic hypotension during chronic treatment with ACE inhibitors.", 
    "37": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors induce haemodynamic, humoral and metabolic actions which have been well characterized during the last decade. The precise mechanisms involved in these actions still need clarification. Among the many questions we need answered are the following: under steady-state conditions, does plasma ACE activity reflect angiotensin I conversion in tissues? Do the low levels of angiotensin II observed after ACE inhibition still contribute to vascular tone? What is the precise role of extrarenal tissue renin in the regulation of vascular tone? What is the role of bradykinin, prostaglandins and the interaction with the sympathetic nervous system in the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibition? We hope that definite answers to these questions will be found during the second decade of the use of ACE inhibitors.", 
    "38": "A method for trypsin-activation of dog plasma inactive renin is described. Liquid phase trypsin (final concentration 6.7 mg/ml) was used and the reaction was stopped after 2 min at 4 degrees C by soybean trypsin inhibitor (13 mg/ml). Renin was measured as angiotensin I (Ang I) generation in trypsin-treated and untreated plasma using the antibody-trapping method, in the presence of excess ox renin substrate. The renin-like activity after trypsin was indeed due to renin, since Ang I generation in dog plasma before and after trypsin treatment was completely inhibited by H-77 at 10(-6) mol/l, and the two IC50 values were very similar (2.7 +/- 0.7 and 2.9 +/- 0.7 at 10(-8) mol/l, respectively). Dog plasma inactive renin was effectively separated from active renin by chromatography on Affigel Blue. Like human prorenin, dog plasma inactive renin rose in response to sodium depletion (furosemide 5 mg/kg, i.v.) followed by a low-salt diet (1 mmol Na+/day) for 4 days, (from 29.6 +/- 8 to 162 +/- 22 microU/ml; P less than 0.01, n = 10). Active renin also increased as expected. Intravenous captopril (6 mg/kg per h), for 3 h, led to a sharp increase in dog plasma active renin (from 53 +/- 8 to 360 +/- 60 microU/ml; P less than 0.01, n = 6), whereas inactive renin remained unchanged.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "39": "The intakes of water and sodium chloride (NaCl) solution were examined in mice following treatment with agents that either stimulate or mimic various components of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Injections of either angiotensin II (Ang II) or isoproterenol produced very little water intake compared with the robust responses to either intracellular dehydration or to extracellular dehydration induced by treatment with polyethylene glycol (PEG). In studies on appetite for NaCl solution, mice exhibited no spontaneous preference for 0.15 M NaCl solution over water and did not change this preference during treatment with deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA), a sodium-deficient diet, or after adrenalectomy. Plasma concentrations of aldosterone were increased in intact mice fed a sodium-deficient diet but were not eliminated by adrenalectomy. However, acute treatment with furosemide in combination with a sodium-deficient diet stimulated an appetite for NaCl solution. Chronic oral administration of an angiotensin I (Ang I) converting enzyme inhibitor failed to induce a NaCl appetite. These findings show that mice are refractory to the induction of either water or NaCl intake by stimuli of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, stimulation that is highly effective in rats; this suggests that there may be major differences among rodents in the hormonal determinants of behaviors related to hydromineral homeostasis.", 
    "40": "1. The plasma renin concentration (PRC) and active renin concentration determined by radioimmunometric assay (ARC) were measured before and after administration of frusemide or captopril to normal volunteers. 2. Injection of 40 mg of frusemide followed by 1 h in the upright position significantly increased both PRC (P less than 0.001) and ARC (P less than 0.001). Oral administration of 50 mg of captopril also increased PRC (P less than 0.05) and ARC (P less than 0.05). 3. ARC and PRC were linearly correlated in the basal supine position [y = 0.635x - 0.048 (y = PRC, x = ARC), r = 0.958, P less than 0.001], after frusemide injection and standing (y = 0.800x + 0.359, r = 0.793, P less than 0.02) and after captopril administration in the supine position (y = 0.938x - 0.555, r = 0.998, P less than 0.001). 4. A cross-calibration study in which pure human renin was added to pooled plasma and PRC and ARC were measured showed linearity between the values obtained by the two methods. 5. The regression line for values of PRC and ARC in the supine position after captopril administration had a significantly greater slope (P less than 0.001) and that for values after frusemide injection and standing was significantly elevated (P less than 0.001) compared with the regression line for basal values in the supine position. 6. These results show that the biological activity of renin may be increased by various acute stimulations of renin to inappropriately high levels compared with the immunological activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "41": "There is good epidemiologic evidence that hypertension is associated with a high risk of cardiovascular disease. However, primary intervention trials have failed to demonstrate that a reduction in blood pressure in hypertensive patients reduces morbidity and mortality from cardiac events. Since various antihypertensive drugs adversely affect lipoprotein metabolism, these drugs may increase associated coronary risk and offset the beneficial effects of lowering blood pressure. This article reviews the effects of various antihypertensive drugs on plasma lipids, lipoproteins, and apolipoproteins. They can be summarized as follows: thiazide-type diuretics cause a marked elevation of plasma triglycerides and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and minor increases in total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL), but have little effects on high-density lipoprotein (HDL). The nonselective beta-blockers do not significantly affect total cholesterol and LDL, but increase total triglycerides and VLDL and decrease HDL. The changes in plasma lipids and lipoproteins caused by cardioselective beta-blockers and beta-blockers with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity are qualitatively similar but less pronounced. Calcium antagonists and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors appear to have no significant effects on plasma lipids. alpha 1-Inhibitors reduce total triglycerides, total cholesterol, VLDL, and LDL and increase HDL. The possible mechanisms by which antihypertensive drugs affect cellular lipid metabolism (e.g., LDL receptor, lipid synthesis, lipoprotein lipase, lecithin cholesteryl acyltransferase, acylcholesteryl acyltransferase, and cholesteryl ester hydrolase) are described. The clinical significance of changes in blood lipids and cellular lipid metabolism caused by antihypertensive drugs is not yet totally clear. Nevertheless, before antihypertensive drug treatment is initiated, blood lipid levels should be measured to identify preexisting hyperlipidemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "42": "The nephrotic syndrome is characterized by increased urinary excretion of albumin and other serum proteins, accompanied by hypoproteinemia and edema formation. Nephrotic patients have lower serum albumin concentrations than do patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis when albumin and protein losses are the same in both groups, suggesting that nephrotic patients may not maximally adapt to loss of protein. The fractional rate of albumin catabolism is increased in nephrotic patients, possibly as a result of increased albumin catabolism by the kidney, but the absolute albumin catabolic rate is decreased in nephrotic patients. The rate of albumin synthesis may be increased, but not sufficiently to maintain normal serum albumin concentration or albumin pools. Augmentation of dietary protein in nephrotic rats directly stimulates albumin synthesis by increasing albumin mRNA content in the liver, but also causes an increase in glomerular permeability to macromolecules so that much if not all of the excess albumin synthesized is lost in the urine. When dietary protein is restricted, the rate of albumin synthesis is not increased either in nephrotic patients or in rats, despite severe hypoalbuminemia. Although dietary protein supplementation may lead to positive nitrogen balance, dietary protein supplementation alone does not cause an increase in serum albumin concentration or body albumin pools, and may instead cause further albumin pool depletion because of changes induced in glomerular permselectivity. The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may blunt the increased albuminuria caused by dietary protein supplementation and allow albumin stores to be increased.", 
    "43": "Since their introduction in clinical practice in 1980, ACE inhibitors have been found useful in the treatment of hypertension and CHF. In hypertension, they are effective as monotherapy in 40% to 50% of the patients, and in combination with diuretics or calcium antagonists, they are effective in up to 85% of the patients. They are well tolerated, are not associated with depression, impotence, bronchospasm or metabolic derangements such as hypokalemia, hyperuricemia or hyperglycemia, and do not have adverse effects on the quality of life. As a result, they are preferred in hypertensive patients with CHF, left ventricular dysfunction, mental depression, older age, coronary artery disease, metabolic disorders, chronic destructive pulmonary disease, and peripheral vascular disease. In CHF they cause long-lasting hemodynamic and symptomatic improvement, improve exercise tolerance, and may lower mortality in certain patient subsets. Evolving new indications for ACE inhibitors include the diagnosis of renovascular hypertension, the prediction of surgical success, the treatment of scleroderma renal crisis, the reduction of proteinuria, renal protection, cardioprotection, the improvement of arterial compliance, in Bartter's syndrome and idiopathic edema, etc. ACE inhibitors are usually well tolerated but in some instances they may cause class-specific side effects such as hypotension; usually reversible azotemia or renal failure, especially in patients with renal artery stenosis or with CHF with low blood pressure; cough; angioedema; and hyperkalemia. Differences among ACE inhibitors are emerging and include chemical class (e.g., zinc ligand), biotransformation, potency, pharmacokinetics, prodrugs, tissue effects, additional pharmacologic properties, and drug interactions.", 
    "44": "Patients with chronic congestive heart failure are known to have increased plasma norepinephrine and plasma renin activity. In order to evaluate neurohumoral changes over time, we measured plasma norepinephrine and plasma renin activity at baseline and sequentially during follow-up in 49 patients with chronic, stable congestive heart failure. All patients were treated with digitalis and diuretics. Converting enzyme inhibitor therapy was prescribed as adjunctive therapy in 22 patients, while 10 patients were taking hydralazine and/or isosorbide dinitrate, seven were taking prazosin, and 10 had no adjunctive therapy. Patients were divided into those taking converting enzyme inhibitors (group I, n = 22) and those not taking converting enzyme inhibitors (group II, n = 27). Group I was followed for a median (25th to 75th percentiles) of 24.3 (18 to 27.9) months, while group II was followed for 18.7 (11.9 to 36.5) months. Results indicate that patients in group I demonstrate a significant positive trend for rise in plasma norepinephrine of 11.7 pg/ml per month (7.8 to 15 pg/ml per month, 95% confidence interval). Patients in group II also demonstrated a significant positive trend in plasma norepinephrine over time of 6.6 pg/ml per month (2.2 to 11.1 pg/ml per month). Moreover, there was a progressive trend upward in plasma renin activity over time in group II (median 0.34 ng/ml/hr per month; range 0.13 to 0.54). The data indicate that there is a significant trend of neurohumoral activation over time in patients with chronic, clinically stable congestive heart failure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "45": "The present study was designed to investigate the effect of vasoactive agents on cellular proliferation in serially passed cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). A substantial reduction in the number of vascular smooth muscle cells was observed with the addition of nifedipine, nicorandil, bunazocine and labetalol compared with that in a control sample. Furthermore, noradrenaline significantly increased the number of vascular smooth muscle cells. In contrast, neither propranolol nor captopril had any effect on number of vascular smooth muscle cells. The cell size, measured as water volume of vascular smooth muscle cells based on the equilibrium distribution of 3-O-(14C-methyl)-D-glucose, did not differ between treatments with the above-mentioned agents. It is suggested that in addition to a known calcium-mediated mechanism, an alpha-receptor-mediated property could be involved in the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells and that clinical use of a calcium antagonist or an alpha-blocker might be useful to prevent the hyperproliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells commonly seen in the vascular walls of patients with hypertension.", 
    "46": "The purpose of this study was to assess the participation and interaction of the renin-angiotensin system and vasopressin in the early stages of the development of salt-induced hypertension. Subtotally nephrectomized rats, fed 1% saline, were treated over a 10-day period with either an antivasopressor V1 antagonist (by osmotic minipump) or an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (either captopril or ramipril, given daily by oral gavage), or a combination of the two modes of treatment. Surprisingly, only ramipril (either alone or in combination with the V1 antagonist) could prevent the development of hypertension in these animals. Our data would not permit conclusion as to whether the different capacity of these agents to prevent salt-induced hypertension was due to a different degree of penetration into the central nervous system, or to some other property.", 
    "47": "1. The aim of the study was to investigate the interactions between angiotensin II (AII) and adrenoceptor-mediated pressor responses in the pithed rat. Emphasis was placed on the effects of AII on blood pressure per se and the possibility of differential effects on alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptor-mediated pressor responses. 2. A low concentration of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, teprotide (1 mg kg-1) lowered the resting diastolic blood pressure (BP) and attenuated only the second phase components of pressor responses to both alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists. Infusion of AII (50 ng kg-1 min-1) did not reverse the attenuating effect of teprotide and did not reliably restore the basal diastolic BP. 3. Although teprotide (10 mg kg-1) did not produce a greater fall in diastolic BP than did the low dose (1 mg kg-1), it attenuated the peak and second phase pressor responses to alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists but had no effect on pressor responses to AII or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT). Infusion of AII reversed the effects of teprotide (10 mg kg-1) provided that rats were pretreated with flurbiprofen (5 mg kg-1), confirming that the depressor effects of the higher dose of teprotide are AII-dependent but that demonstration of this was complicated by products of cyclo-oxygenase. 4. The AII-receptor antagonist, saralasin (4 micrograms kg-1 min-1) attenuated alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptor-mediated pressor responses in a manner similar to that of teprotide (10 mg kg-1), suggesting that in this pithed rat model the alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated responses were selectively facilitated by endogenous AII. 5. Infusion of AII (50 ng kg-1 min-1) over a 60 min period did not produce a pressor response in the absence of other drugs but did facilitate pressor responses to alpha-adrenoceptor agonists. This confirms that AII can modulate alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated responses independently of basal blood pressure. 6. Overall the results indicate a facilitatory role for endogenous AII on alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated pressor responses. This is discussed in relation to the failure to demonstrate this convincingly under similar conditions on sympathetic nerve-mediated pressor responses.", 
    "48": "The classical therapy of congestive heart failure (CHF) with inotropic agents (digitalis and newer inotropics) and diuretic agents remains unsatisfactory in many cases. More recently it is recognized, that some of the neuro-endocrine compensatory processes associated with CHF are detrimental in the long run, and therefore potentially targets for drug treatment. This holds for the following neuro-endocrine mechanisms: 1) increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system and high plasma catecholamines, accompanied by down-regulation of beta 1- but not beta 2-receptors in the heart; 2) stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), causing higher levels of renin, A II and aldosterone. The detrimental sequelae of both processes are even enhanced by their complex mutual interactions. Drug treatment aiming to reduce or suppress these processes and their negative results is potentially offered by: vasodilators, counteracting vasoconstriction, low dose selective beta 1-adrenoceptor blockers, which will not only impair tachycardia but also up-regulate cardiac beta 1-receptors and hence improve the inotropic response to catecholamines; aldosterone antagonists and ACE-inhibitors counteracting the activated RAAS. The beneficial effect of the ACE-inhibitors in CHF is well established and superior to that of classical vasodilators, since it additionally counteracts the enhanced RAAS activity.",

    "53": "Local infusion of both bradykinin and enalaprilic acid, the active metabolite of the converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril, elicited dose-dependent reduction of the compliance of the saphenous vein in conscious dogs. The competitive bradykinin B1-receptor antagonist, des-Arg9-Leu8-bradykinin antagonized venous responses to both bradykinin and enalaprilic acid effectively and with similar potency whereas the bradykinin B2-receptor antagonist Thi5,8,D-Phe7-bradykinin was about 100 times less potent when tested against bradykinin. Under control conditions local infusion of angiotensin II had no contractile activity but it elicited considerable venodilation after blockade of endogenous thromboxane A2 synthesis by dazoxiben. Blockade of the converting enzyme by enalapril (3 mg/kg i.v.) enhanced the maximal responses to bradykinin. Under these conditions concomitant local infusion of angiotensin II attenuated the venoconstrictor effects of bradykinin. Venous responses to bradykinin were inhibited after oral treatment of the dogs with the thromboxane A2 receptor antagonist BM 13,177 and nearly completely abolished after i.v. administration of the thromboxane synthesis inhibitor dazoxiben. In contrast, venous responses to enalaprilic acid were unchanged by thromboxane A2 receptor blockade and enhanced after dazoxiben. Following oral administration of cyclosporine-A (10 and 30 mg/kg), venous responses to bradykinin were attenuated while those to enalaprilic acid remained unchanged. Concomitant local infusion of the angiotensin II receptor antagonist saralasin (1 microgram/min) reversed completely the cyclosporine-A-induced reduction of the venoconstrictor effects of bradykinin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "54": "On three separate occasions 12 atopic subjects were injected intradermally with two doses of antigen and one of saline as control. Pretreatment with terfenadine 60 mg orally significantly inhibited the flare response to both the lower dose of antigen and to saline (P less than 0.05). Ingestion of enalapril 5 mg orally 3 h before increased the flare response to both doses of antigen. Neither enalapril nor terfenadine affected the weal response when compared with placebo. Both endogenous histamine and bradykinin appear to be released during the intradermal flare response but are not important in the weal reaction to antigen.", 
    "55": "1. Lisinopril and enalapril were administered as 2.5 mg single doses and as eight single daily 2.5 mg doses to separate groups of six patients with chronic renal failure. Patients were receiving regular haemodialysis. 2. In the absence of haemodialysis, the decline in plasma concentrations of lisinopril and enalaprilat was extremely slow and plasma concentrations were generally high. 3. Haemodialysis had large effects on plasma concentrations of lisinopril and enalaprilat. A 4 h period reduced plasma concentrations of both drugs by around one-half and often by significantly more than this. Even 1 or 2 h of haemodialysis had significant effects. 4. Haemodialysis plasma clearance was similar for both drugs with mean values of the order of 40 ml min-1. Clearance did not markedly differ when measured after 1, 2 or 4 h of haemodialysis or after single or multiple doses of lisinopril or enalapril. 5. The design of dosage regimens of both lisinopril and enalapril for patients with severe renal impairment or chronic renal failure should take into consideration the use and effects of haemodialysis.", 
    "56": "The MRL/1 and New Zealand black-New Zealand white cross (NZB x W) mice spontaneously develop a disease similar to systemic lupus erythematosus in man. The effect of antihypertensive treatment on MRL/1 and NZB x W mice was studied with respect to survival, blood pressure, proteinuria, haematuria and renal histopathology. The treatment consisted of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (captopril and enalapril) and bretylium, a sympathetic blocker. Tail systolic blood pressure was measured with a strain gauge technique. All antihypertensive drugs caused a reduction in blood pressure in both strains. In MRL/1 bretylium and both ACE inhibitors improved renal histopathology, but only captopril prolonged survival, and it decreased proteinuria and haematuria. In NZB x W captopril decreased proteinuria but did not influence survival or renal histopathology. Bretylium was without any effect on these parameters. At the doses used captopril improves survival in MRL/1 mice and decreases proteinuria and haematuria in both MRL/1 and NZB x W mice. Since bretylium and enalapril lack this property despite a similar blood pressure reduction, it seems to be a drug-specific action.", 
    "57": "We compared exercise responses in two groups of hypertensive patients treated with an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (lisinopril, 20-80 mg/day, n = 17) or a cardioselective beta-blocker (atenolol, 50-200 mg/day, n = 9). Measurements were made at rest and during exercise at 25 W (2.7 mets) and at 50 W (3.8 mets) on a bicycle ergometer (where mets is exercising oxygen consumption/resting oxygen consumption) after 4 weeks of placebo, and again after 12 weeks of drug administration. Both drugs reduced (P less than 0.05) mean arterial pressure. Atenolol caused significant decreases in the heart rate (approximately 25%) and cardiac output (approximately 26%; Defares CO2 rebreathing), and significant increases in total peripheral resistance (approximately 30%) and arteriovenous O2 content (approximately 20%). Lisinopril decreased (P less than 0.05) stroke volume. At the same exercise intensity systolic blood pressure, arteriovenous O2 and total peripheral resistance were lower (P less than 0.05) and the heart rate was higher (P less than 0.05) after lisinopril than after atenolol. After the treatment of hypertension with the ACE inhibitor the responses to exercise were less restrictive than those after treatment with the cardioselective beta-blocker.", 
    "58": "Angiotensin II is the main regulator of both glomerular haemodynamics and glomerular capillary permeability. An alteration in the function of intrarenal angiotensin II seems to be the cause of diabetic glomerulopathy in animals and humans. In order to investigate the renal effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril (5 mg once a day), 24 normotensive diabetic patients with persistent proteinuria, after a 3-month run-in period, were randomly allocated to receive the active drug (12 patients) or the corresponding placebo, for the 6 months. Effective renal plasma flow, glomerular filtration rate, renal vascular resistance and filtration fraction were measured at the end of the run-in and the treatment periods. Blood pressure, heart rate, urinary albumin excretion, plasma renin activity and aldosterone, blood glucose, serum fructosamine and body weight were checked monthly during the run-in and every 2 months during the treatment period. Enalapril decreased urinary albumin excretion in the normotensive diabetic patients without any changes in systemic blood pressure or glomerular haemodynamics. These results indicate that ACE inhibition interferes with the glomerular capillary permeability induced by angiotensin II.", 
    "59": "The development of hypertension in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) up to 8 weeks of age involves sodium retention with reduced fractional sodium excretion. Since angiotensin II (Ang II) directly stimulates proximal tubular sodium transport, we investigated age-related changes in proximal reabsorption (Jv), using shrinking split-drop micropuncture before and after enalaprilat in SHR at 5, 7 and 12 weeks of age and in age-matched Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). Control values for Jv were higher in the SHR than in WKY at 5 weeks, but lower at 7 and 12 weeks, consistent with an early phase of sodium retention. Enalaprilat reduced mean Jv by approximately 15% in all WKY groups, indicating the extent of Ang II-stimulated transport. In the SHR there was an age-dependent reduction in the effect of enalaprilat on Jv, and by 12 weeks no Ang II stimulation could be detected. Age-related changes in proximal tubular reabsorption could contribute to sodium retention in the young SHR and may reflect a more general pattern of inherited transport defects.", 
    "60": "Treatment with an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor in renovascular hypertension produces acute effects on renal function; however, the long-term consequences of this are not known. We have studied the effect of chronic enalapril treatment on renal structure and function in the two-kidney, one clip model of renovascular hypertension in the rat. Four weeks after the left renal artery was clipped, the hypertensive rats were randomly allocated to treatment with enalapril, minoxidil or to no treatment. The drug dose was titrated for maximal hypotensive effect. After 4 months of treatment blood pressures were 129 +/- 3 mmHg (enalapril), 193 +/- 5 mmHg (minoxidil) and 220 +/- 4.8 mmHg (no treatment). Twelve months later survival was 84% (enalapril group), 48% (minoxidil group) and 15% (untreated group). Split kidney function (51Cr-EDTA clearance, ml/min) of the clipped kidneys was 0.0 (enalapril group), 0.26 +/- 0.23 (minoxidil group) and 0.74 +/- 0.13 (untreated group). The clipped kidney from enalapril-treated rats weighed 0.46 +/- 0.1 g, much less than in the minoxidil-treated group (1.2 +/- 0.07) or the untreated group (1.14 +/- 0.10). Enalapril treatment was withdrawn for 2 weeks in five rats, but the clipped kidney remained small and non-functional. Histological examination revealed marked interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy in clipped kidneys from both enalapril groups, in contrast to minor changes in the minoxidil-treated and the untreated groups. We conclude that chronic enalapril treatment of two-kidney, one clip hypertension in the rat improved survival and preserved total renal function, but was associated with irreversible fibrotic atrophy of the clipped kidney.", 
    "61": "Sixteen patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension were randomly allocated to 6 weeks of treatment with nifedipine and captopril in a crossover trial. Nifedipine and captopril lowered blood pressure significantly both 2 and 12 h after the last dose. Apart from an increased heart rate 2 h after the last dose of nifedipine, the heart rate did not change. Platelet factor 4, thromboxane B2, 6-keto prostaglandin F1 alpha (6-keto PGF1 alpha) and cyclic (c)AMP did not change during either therapy. There was no correlation between the plasma concentration of nifedipine measured 2 and 12 h after the last dose and the platelet variables described above. The findings show that nifedipine and captopril in therapeutic doses do not affect platelet activity in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension.", 
    "62": "To elucidate the role of bradykinin in the cardiac actions of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, experiments were performed in isolated ischaemic hearts from guinea pigs and rats treated with the ACE inhibitor ramipril and the bradykinin-antagonist D-Arg[Hyp2,Thi5,8,D-Phe7]BK. In guinea pig hearts bradykinin increased coronary flow. Single oral pretreatment with ramipril (10 mg/kg) potentiated but perfusion with the bradykinin antagonist abolished this effect. In ischaemic working rat heart preparations perfusion with ramiprilat (2.58 x 10(-7) mol/l) or single oral pretreatment with ramipril (1 mg/kg) protected the heart from the ventricular fibrillations that invariably occurred upon reperfusion after ischaemia. Lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase activities, as well as lactate formation, were decreased in the venous effluent of pretreated hearts. Moreover, ACE inhibition in the heart improved cardiodynamic and metabolic parameters; left ventricular pressure, (dp/dt)max and coronary flow were increased and myocardial tissue levels of glycogen, ATP and creatine phosphate were elevated. A comparable array of changes was seen when rat hearts were perfused with bradykinin (1 x 10(-10) mol/l), which reduced enzymatic activities in the perfusate and improved the metabolic parameters in the myocardium. These cardioprotective effects produced by both the ACE inhibitor ramipril and bradykinin were completely abolished when the bradykinin-antagonist (1 x 10(-5) mol/l) was added to the perfusate. They were only partially attenuated when indomethacin (1 x 10(-6) mol/l) was perfused. Higher concentrations of bradykinin (1 x 10(-7) mol/l) or ramiprilat (2.58 x 10(-5) mol/l) overcame the actions of the bradykinin-antagonist.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "63": "The interactions of blood pressure, salt intake and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition were investigated in the Dahl salt-sensitive (DS) and salt-resistant (DR) strains of rats. Eight-week-old DS and DR (40 of each) were separately randomized to receive a low- (0.4% NaCl) or a high- (8% NaCl) salt diet for 3 weeks. Thereafter the rats were further separated randomly to receive the ACE inhibitor lisinopril (3-8 mg/kg per day) or no drug treatment for 11 weeks. In untreated DS rats blood pressure rose, paralleled by a higher left ventricular mass (ratio left ventricular weight/body weight) irrespective of salt intake. Lisinopril lowered blood pressure to normotensive levels in all groups except DS rats on a high-salt diet, despite doses of up to 100 mg/kg per day, although there was a significant fall in blood pressure. Lisinopril reduced left ventricular mass significantly on the low- but not on the high-salt diet. Plasma renin activity increased on lisinopril treatment in all groups except DS rats on the high-salt diet. Regression of an increased left ventricular mass by ACE inhibition seemed to be impaired by a high salt intake, even when blood pressure was lowered. Therefore, although for regression of left ventricular hypertrophy, reduction of afterload was the leading factor, this might be adversely affected by a high salt intake.", 
    "64": "Kininase I (carboxypeptidase N) and kininase II (angiotensin converting enzyme) were isolated from human plasma by gel filtration on Sephadex G 200, then separated and partially purified by ion exchange chromatography. These two partially purified enzymic preparations allowed us to demonstrate that protamine underwent an extensive degradation only when both kininases acted simultaneously. The effects of CoCl2, an activator, and of several inhibitors, amongst which captopril, suggest that the same enzymatic system is responsible for the in vitro protaminasic activity of diluted unfractionated plasma.", 
    "65": "We assessed the effect of increasing doses of perindopril on the renal adaptation to withdrawal of dietary sodium in rats. In treated animals, the amount of sodium lost during the 6-day observation period was higher than that found in untreated rats, but only at doses that significantly inhibited the circulating angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). Sodium loss was not enhanced by increasing the dose of the agent. In contrast, the renal vasodilatory effect of perindopril was dose-dependent, and was significant with the lowest perindopril dose, which did not impair sodium conservation. These results suggest that in the rat, perindopril may act on the renal vasculature before impairing the natriuretic adaptation in response to sodium restriction.", 
    "66": "Inhibition of the action of endothelially-located angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in blood vessels of the human forearm was studied using enalaprilat, the active metabolite of the prodrug enalapril. In a dose of 5 micrograms/min enalaprilat inhibits arteriolar vasoconstriction in response to angiotensin I (Ang I) and enhances vasodilation in response to bradykinin. At this dose enalaprilat had no effect on resting forearm blood flow, or on the reduction in forearm blood flow in response to application of lower body negative pressure, in subjects with normal sodium intake. Following sodium depletion, however, enalaprilat produced an increase in resting forearm blood flow compared with the response in the same subjects under normal-sodium conditions. It appears that local ACE within forearm resistance vessels of healthy volunteers is unlikely to play an important role in regulation of local vascular tone in the sodium-replete state. However, in sodium-depleted subjects, and perhaps also in other circumstances where circulating concentrations of Ang I are elevated, local ACE may significantly affect vascular tone.", 
    "67": "Perindopril, an orally active angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, was fed by gavage to male Sprague-Dawley rats. The effect on tissue ACE was measured ex vivo by quantitation of binding of the specific radioligand 125I-3511A to ACE in tissue homogenates. In an acute time-course study perindopril (1, 4 or 8 mg/kg) inhibited plasma ACE activity by more than 90% in 1 h but no inhibition remained after 24 h. Kidney ACE was affected to a similar degree and followed a similar time-course of inhibition to plasma ACE. In contrast, ACE was inhibited to a lesser degree in lung and aorta homogenates, with maximum effect 4-8 h postgavage, and with inhibition persisting 48 h following the dose. In testis homogenates, ACE remained unaltered following the administration of perindopril at all three doses. Therefore we conclude that plasma ACE inhibition does not parallel tissue effects, and that drug penetration into the testis appears to be limited.", 
    "68": "The effects of perindopril, 4 mg orally, on brachial artery blood flow and diameter (pulsed Doppler) and on forearm vascular resistance were investigated and compared in six normal subjects and 10 congestive heart failure patients (New York Heart Association class III or IV). Pre-drug values of brachial artery blood flow and diameter were significantly lower in patients with congestive heart failure than in normal subjects, the reverse being true for forearm vascular resistance. In normal subjects perindopril increased brachial artery blood flow and decreased forearm vascular resistance, while in patients with congestive heart failure the same effects were observed but they were more pronounced and brachial artery diameter was increased. In patients with congestive heart failure, when perindopril effects were maximal, brachial artery blood flow remained below the baseline values of normal subjects but brachial artery diameter was normalized. Finally, there was a correlation between the drug-induced decrease in forearm vascular resistance and basal plasma noradrenaline values in all subjects taken together. These results indicate that: (1) the renin-angiotensin system plays a major role in vasoconstriction in patients with congestive heart failure; (2) this vasoconstriction affects both large arteries and arterioles; (3) perindopril is able to considerably improve peripheral haemodynamics in congestive heart failure; and (4) this improvement is linked to the initial sympathetic tone.", 
    "69": "Two methods of radio-inhibitor binding to tissue membrane homogenates and in vitro autoradiography have been used for ex vivo studies on the inhibition of tissue angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) following acute and chronic administration of ACE inhibitors. Tissue ACE is differentially inhibited in time and degree in different tissues of the rat. Plasma and kidney ACE are inhibited completely at low doses whereas lung and aorta are only inhibited by 60-70%, even after very high does of ACE inhibitors. In the brain only those structures outside the blood-brain barrier are inhibited at low doses but at high doses perindopril appears able to cross the blood-brain barrier. Similarly, testicular ACE is not inhibited and appears to be protected by a blood-testis barrier. Preliminary results suggest that after chronic administration there is also a variable pattern of induction and inhibition of ACE in different tissues. By relating the degree of tissue inhibition to physiological responses it may be possible to determine the role of local renin-angiotensin systems in regional haemodynamics and in the hypotensive action of ACE inhibitors. Further, the techniques of radioligand inhibitor binding and in vitro autoradiography can be extended to other important cardiovascular enzymes (renin and kallikrein) when suitable high affinity specific inhibitors become available.", 
    "70": "The possible role of vascular angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in the maintenance of one-kidney, one clip (1-K,1C) hypertensive rats was studied in comparison with age-matched, one-kidney (1-K) normotensive rats. Mean blood pressure was elevated after partial occlusion of the left renal artery with unilateral nephrectomy, and the high blood pressure persisted for at least 11 weeks, whereas no significant changes in mean blood pressure were observed in 1-K rats. Plasma and vascular renin activities and plasma ACE activity did not differ between the two groups of rats, both 5 and 11 weeks after operation. In contrast, ACE activity in lung and mesenteric arteries in 1-K,1C hypertensive rats was significantly elevated 11 weeks after operation, but not 5 weeks after operation, compared with the matched 1-K normotensive rats. In addition, the decreases in mean blood pressure induced by ACE inhibition were significantly greater in 1-K,1C rats than those in 1-K rats. These results indicate that the elevation of vascular ACE activity may play an important role in the maintenance of high blood pressure and may result in hypotension in response to ACE inhibitors in the chronic stage of 1-K,1C hypertension.", 
    "71": "Blood pressure was studied at rest, continuously for 24 h and during dynamic and isometric exercise in previously untreated males with documented mild hypertension. The antihypertensive efficacy of atenolol was compared with that of enalapril in a randomized, double-blind, crossover study, in order to elucidate whether or not these more comprehensive measurements could better distinguish between the efficacy of the drugs than office recordings made at rest. Atenolol proved more effective than enalapril in reducing diastolic blood pressure at rest (P less than 0.05), and systolic blood pressure during dynamic exercise (P less than 0.001), but in the 24-h ambulatory study there were no differences in effectiveness between the drugs. Several patients did not attain our pre-set diastolic treatment goal at rest (less than or equal to 90 mmHg) on single-drug therapy, thus indicating a need for supplementary treatment. When blood pressure was analysed over 24 h, however, there were few recordings greater than 90 mmHg, and the need for supplementary treatment appeared less obvious. Therefore, more comprehensive blood pressure measurements should be considered in the evaluation of antihypertensive treatment.", 
    "72": "Two experiments were performed with Sprague-Dawley rats to study the effects of different inhibitors of angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) on water intake and sodium appetite. Subcutaneous administration of low doses of either enalapril (MK421) or ramipril (Hoe498), like captopril, was dipsogenic. Acute administration of ramipril also enhanced the drinking response to peripherally administered angiotensin I (Ang I). Higher doses inhibited the drinking response to Ang I, administered acutely either peripherally or centrally. These data provide behavioral evidence that the nonsulfhydryl inhibitors enalapril and ramipril inhibit brain converting enzyme activity and that they are considerably more potent than captopril. All three of these compounds, administered chronically in food, induced an appetite for sodium chloride (NaCl) solution. Enalapril and ramipril were more potent than captopril. Plasma renin activity was increased by each of these inhibitors, but the magnitude of the increase was not clearly related to the amount of NaCl consumed. The water intake in response to acute administration of either Ang I or isoproterenol was not reliably increased in rats treated chronically with these inhibitors.", 
    "73": "Introduction of ciclosporin A into immunosuppressive therapy is considered a major progress in improving results of organ transplantation. Clinical use of ciclosporin, however, is limited by a low therapeutic index and toxic side effects. Therefore, interactions of ciclosporin with other drugs are clinically important. In our study, we used enalapril, furosemide and verapamil for treatment of arterial hypertension in cardiac transplant recipients and investigated the influence of these drugs on ciclosporin whole blood trough levels. The antihypertensive regimen used in this study normalized blood pressure in each of the 25 patients. Enalapril and furosemide did not influence ciclosporin levels. Adding verapamil, however, resulted in a significant increase of ciclosporin levels, whereas cessation of the drug in one patient treated with verapamil only lowered ciclosporin levels. Thus, when verapamil is introduced or discontinued in patients on ciclosporin, close monitoring of ciclosporin levels and dosage adjustment are necessary. Besides its specific effects verapamil allows reduction of ciclosporin dosage necessary to maintain unaltered levels, which is important regarding cost of therapy. In general, use of any drug with unknown influence on ciclosporin levels requires careful monitoring, even if information exists on other substances of the same group of drugs in this respect. This is especially indicated in drugs known to influence the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme system.", 
    "74": "Chronic partial ureteral obstruction (CPUO) causes an increase in renal vascular resistance (RVR) that can be prevented by angiotensin II (ANG II)-converting enzyme inhibition. To assess the early effects of CPUO, guinea pigs subjected to neonatal left ureteral obstruction were anesthetized at 11-13 days of age for measurement of cardiac output and renal blood flow (RBF) using radioactive microspheres. Although RBF of the hydronephrotic kidney was not decreased at this age, that of the intact kidney more than doubled (P less than 0.01). To evaluate the hemodynamic response to relief of 5 or 10 days of neonatal left CPUO, animals were studied at 19-28 days of age. Although chronic enalapril maleate administration (30 mg.kg-1.day-1) did not further reduce the ratio of RVR to total vascular resistance (TVR) of the postobstructed kidney, it lowered RVR/TVR of the intact contralateral kidney by 40% (P less than 0.05). Renal renin content [RRC, pg angiotensin I (ANG I).mg protein-1.h-1] was twofold higher in both kidneys of animals with unilateral CPUO compared with those of sham-operated guinea pigs (P less than 0.03), and relief of obstruction normalized RRC. The rise in RVR/TVR resulting from ANG II infusion was not different in left kidneys of sham, CPUO, and CPUO-relief groups. However, for the intact kidney of animals with contralateral relief of CPUO, the increase was greater than in remaining groups (P less than 0.05). We conclude that by reducing intrarenal renin, relief of neonatal unilateral CPUO decreased ANG-mediated vasoconstriction of the postobstructed kidney and increased the vasoconstrictor response of the intact kidney to ANG II.", 
    "75": "Adrenergic hyporesponsiveness in congestive heart failure has been understood previously in terms of a reduction in beta-adrenergic receptors. We have examined another hypothesis, one that states the stimulatory guanine nucleotide regulatory protein (Gs) that couples the beta-adrenergic receptor to adenylate cyclase activity is also decreased in congestive heart failure. In addition to the 40% decrease in lymphocyte beta-adrenergic receptors in patients in congestive heart failure (5.9 +/- 0.7 vs. 9.7 +/- 1.4 fmol/mg, p less than 0.05), we found an 80% decrease in levels of Gs compared with age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects (72.5 +/- 19 vs. 376 +/- 73 fmol/mg, p less than 0.05). Myocardial Gs levels correlated significantly with lymphocyte Gs levels. We also assessed the hypothesis that reductions in beta-adrenergic receptors and in Gs are reversible after successful therapy with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Treatment with either captopril or lisinopril was associated with clinical improvement, an increase in beta-adrenergic receptor density (from 5.5 +/- 0.7 to 8.7 +/- 1.5 fmol/mg), and a twofold increase in Gs levels (p less than 0.05). Thus, the data are compatible with Gs serving as an adaptable and reversible regulator of the adrenergic response in congestive heart failure. In view of the fact that Gs is a transducing element common to all hormones that stimulate cyclic adenosine 5'-monophosphate production, the observations could extend to other abnormal neurohumoral mechanisms in congestive heart failure.", 
    "76": "Inhibition of plasma angiotensin II generation does not fully explain the chronic hypotensive effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Therefore, the pattern of tissue ACE inhibition in rats was studied after oral administration of perindopril, a new ACE inhibitor. Tissue ACE was measured by quantitative in vitro autoradiography using [125I]-351A as a radioligand and compared with plasma ACE and the pressor response to intravenous (i.v.) angiotensin I. Following oral perindopril (1 mg/kg), plasma ACE activity was acutely reduced, but recovered over 24 h. The peak concentration of plasma perindoprilic acid, the active diacid of perindopril, occurred at 1 h, and the drug was undetectable by 24 h. The pressor response to i.v. angiotensin I was inhibited by 95% at 4 h and had not fully recovered by 24 h. Four hours after oral administration of perindopril, ACE was markedly inhibited in the proximal tubules of the kidney (24% control), lung parenchyma (10%), and aortic wall (18%) (p less than 0.01). At 24 h, ACE in these tissues had only partially recovered (32-63%). ACE was also identified in vascular endothelium of organs, including the lung, kidney, and testis; in these sites, vascular ACE showed a pattern of inhibition similar to that of aortic ACE. In contrast, ACE in testicular seminiferous tubules was unaffected by perindopril. These results demonstrate a prolonged effect of ACE inhibitors on tissue ACE that may better explain the time course of these drugs than the changes in plasma ACE or plasma levels of the drug.", 
    "77": "The formation of AII from a metabolite of AI, des-leu10-angiotensin I [A(1-9)] has been studied in centrifugal fractions of rat lung and kidney using gradient elution HPLC to monitor the formation of peptide products. AII-forming activity was present in kidney S2 (22.3 nmol/mg protein/min) but not in kidney P2 centrifugal fractions. Lung S2 fractions showed relatively weak AII-forming activity (0.34 nmole/mg protein/min) whilst no activity was observed in lung P2. Carboxypeptidase N-like activity measured using both Hipp-Arg and Hipp-Lys as synthetic substrates did not parallel AII-forming activity, since this activity was highest in the P2 fractions of both lung and kidney, as were ACE and aminopeptidase activities. Whilst the major peptide produced in kidney S2 was AII (71%) significant amounts of both AIII (23%) and A(2-9) (6%) were also observed. In lung the amounts of these peptides produced as a percentage of the A(1-9) degrading activity were 2.9%, 2.4% and 21% respectively. The AII-forming activity in kidney S2 was not inhibited by enalaprilat, bestatin, amastatin, phosphoramidon or Pro-Phe but was inhibited (31%) by 1 mM cobalt (II). 1,10-Phenanthroline, iodoacetic acid, EDTA and puromycin significantly enhanced the formation of AII and increased the rate of degradation of the substrate, A(1-9). These results support the concept of a sequential carboxypeptidase pathway operating, particularly in kidney, to produce AII from AI. These results provide further evidence of an alternative metabolic pathway for the formation of AII not involving angiotensin converting enzyme.", 
    "78": "The antihypertensive effect and tolerability of enalaprilat, an intravenously administered angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, was studied in 65 patients with moderate or severe hypertension. In this randomized, double-blind study, enalaprilat was compared with placebo in 42 (22 enalaprilat, 20 placebo) moderate hypertensive (diastolic blood pressure [BP] 100 to 114 mm Hg) patients. It was compared with furosemide in 23 (12 enalaprilat, 11 furosemide) severe hypertensive (diastolic BP 115 to 130 mm Hg) patients. Enalaprilat (1.25 or 5.0 mg), placebo (5% dextrose) or furosemide (40 or 80 mg) was given every 6 hours intravenously up to 48 hours. In the moderate hypertension stratum, the mean supine diastolic BP was significantly (p less than or equal to 0.01) reduced from baseline at all timepoints in the enalaprilat group. These diastolic BP reductions were significantly (p less than or equal to 0.01) greater in the enalaprilat group than the placebo at 1 to 24 hours (-12 vs -4 mm Hg), with 59% of the patients responding to enalaprilat compared with 30% of the patients responding to placebo. An even greater reduction (p less than or equal to 0.01) was seen at 25 to 48 hours (-14 vs -7 mm Hg, with 73% enalaprilat vs 58% placebo responders). Significant (p less than or equal to 0.01) reductions in mean, supine systolic BP were also seen at 1 to 24 hours (-22 vs -2 mm Hg) and 25 to 48 hours (-24 vs -8 mm Hg) during the 48 hours of the double-blind treatment phase in the enalaprilat group compared with placebo.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "79": "Trimucase II, a proteolytic enzyme isolated from Trimeresurus mucrosquamatus venom, caused rat hind-paw edema dose dependently. Captopril potentiated significantly, while pretreatment with cellulose sulfate suppressed the trimucase II-induced edematous response. Pretreatment with diphenhydramine and methysergide reduced by 42 and 46% the edema induced by trimucase II and kallikrein, respectively. The residual response was significantly further depressed by [Thi5,8,D-Phe7]bradykinin and trasylol. Kinin generation by trimucase II was also found in vitro from plasma and was concentration- and time-dependent. Kinin formation was inhibited by soybean trypsin inhibitor, trasylol and endogenous kininase. The kinins released were destroyed by chymotrypsin. Unlike cellulose sulfate, trimucase II caused kinin formation from Factor XII-deficient and prekallikrein-deficient plasma but not from high molecular weight kininogen-deficient plasma. These data indicate that, in addition to the mediators released from mast cells, kinins have an important role in the edema caused by trimucase II, and that kinins are released from plasma, probably due to direct activation of kininogen.", 
    "80": "The thrust of this essay will be to organize a growing body of evidence which indicates that an abnormality of the kidney, and the adrenal, involving disordered regulation through the renin-angiotensin system, is responsible for the pathogenesis in about 45% of patients--a discrete subgroup that may be most common cause of hypertension. That fundamental abnormality leads to disordered renal sodium handling and sodium-sensitive hypertension, abnormalities in the renal vascular response to changes in sodium intake and to angiotensin II, blunted decrements of renin release in response to saline or angiotensin II, and an accentuated renal vasodilator response to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. ACE inhibition not only increases renal blood flow substantially more in these patients than it does in normal subjects, ACE inhibition also restores to normal the renal vascular and adrenal response to angiotensin II, renin release in response to angiotensin II, renal sodium handling--and ultimately blood pressure. Finally, and perhaps most intriguing, similar abnormalities have been found in 50% of the normotensive offspring of patients with essential hypertension and evidence is accruing to indicate that the abnormality is inherited as a Mendelian dominant.", 
    "81": "The effects of calcium (-)-N-[(S)-3(N-cyclohexylcarbonyl-D-alanyl)-thio]-2-methylpropion] -L- prolinate (MC-838, altiopril calcium), an inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme, were investigated in 9 isolated atrial preparations and 7 intact anesthetized donor dogs. In 7 intact dogs, 1-10 mg/Kg of MC-838 caused a decrease in systemic blood pressure, but no significant influence on heart rate was observed. At the same time, in isolated atria perfused with donor's blood, significant increases in developed tension and slight increases in sinus rate were observed with 3 and 10 mg/Kg of MC-838. Intraarterial MC-838 at 10-300 micrograms did not induce significant cardiac effects and MC-838 at 1-3 mg caused an increase in developed tension and a slight increase in sinus rate. The positive inotropic and chronotropic effects were not blocked by adequate doses of propranolol, which significantly blocked norepinephrine-induced positive chronotropic and inotropic effects. It is concluded that a large amount of MC-838 has slight cardiotonic properties which are not mediated via a beta-adrenergic mechanism.", 
    "82": "Congestive heart failure, a constellation of signs and symptoms that result from the heart's inability to provide sufficient oxygenated blood to metabolizing tissues, is a major cause for concern in the elderly. The prognosis is ominous, with a 10% per year mortality rate after the initial CHF episode, and a 30 to 60% per year rate for patients who remain symptomatic despite digitalis and diuretic treatment. Common etiologies in CHF are discussed, and a case history illustrating CHF symptomatology is provided. The role of diuretics, digitalis, ACE-inhibitors, and other pharmacologic agents is reviewed and updated, and the value of patient education is discussed.", 
    "83": "The pyrrolizidine alkaloid monocrotaline produces pulmonary inflammation, hemorrhage, fibrosis, and hypertension. In rats, monocrotaline pneumotoxicity can be ameliorated by cotreatment with inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), such as CL242817. In the present study, serum and urine copper (Cu) concentrations were evaluated as indices of cardiopulmonary injury in rats sacrificed after six weeks of continuous administration of monocrotaline (0 to 3.6 mg per kg per day, in the drinking water) or CL242817 (60 mg per kg per day, in the feed), or both. Monocrotaline-treated rats exhibited dose-dependent increases in (1) pulmonary histopathology, (2) pulmonary endothelial dysfunction (decreased lung plasminogen activator activity, and increased prostacyclin and thromboxane production), (3) pulmonary hydroxyproline (collagen) content, and (4) cardiac right ventricular hypertrophy (an anatomic correlate of pulmonary hypertension). The severity of cardiopulmonary damage was accompanied by a dose-dependent elevation in serum Cu concentration. Serum iron concentration, in contrast, did not change. Urinary Cu concentration correlated roughly with that of serum, but the variability within groups was high. Cotreatment with the ACE inhibitor CL242817 not only ameliorated monocrotaline-induced right heart enlargement and lung hydroxyproline accumulation but also reduced the hypercupremia in monocrotaline-treated rats. Thus, serum copper concentration appears to be an accurate and minimally invasive index of monocrotaline pneumotoxicity in this model of pulmonary hypertension.", 
    "84": "In these studies, the effect of a 6-wk treatment by placebo, the calcium-channel blocker nifedipine, or the converting-enzyme inhibitor captopril was assessed in normotensive patients with insulin-dependent diabetes and incipient nephropathy. In response to captopril and nifedipine, arterial pressure decreased slightly and to a similar extent. These drugs resulted in opposite effects on urinary excretion of albumin [i.e., increase in urinary albumin excretion (UAE) by 40% during nifedipine treatment and decrease by 40% during captopril treatment]. No change in UAE was observed in the placebo group. This observation of opposite changes in UAE in the presence of a similar fall in arterial pressure suggests that the effects of captopril and nifedipine on UAE result from some difference in their intrarenal action. The data do not present recommendations for the use or disuse of captopril or nifedipine in such a group of patients and do not allow extrapolation to hypertensive diabetic subjects well controlled by other conventional antihypertensive agents.", 
    "85": "This article briefly reviews the literature on the incidence of hypertension in the diabetic population, the risks associated with this combination of conditions, and the nonpharmacologic and other therapies available to lower blood pressure in these patients. Although several studies of nonpharmacologic therapies and diuretics are considered, the emphasis is on the reported advantages and disadvantages of beta-blockers, centrally acting agents, alpha-adrenergic-blocking agents, calcium-channel blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "86": "Microalbuminuria is a reliable predictor of the eventual development of overt diabetic nephropathy and blood pressure is known to accelerate the course of this nephropathy. In the present studies, the effect of a 6-week treatment by placebo (n = 7), nifedipine (n = 7) and captopril (n = 8) on renal function and urinary excretion of albumin (UAE) was investigated in normotensive, insulin-dependent, diabetic patients with incipient nephropathy (UAE greater than 15 micrograms/min). No change in arterial pressure, renal function or UAE was observed in the placebo group. In response to captopril and nifedipine, mean arterial pressure decreased slightly and similarly in both groups. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) increased to a similar extent in the nifedipine group, thus resulting in no change in filtration fraction (FF). In response to captopril, GFR was unchanged whilst ERPF increased; as a consequence FF decreased. Opposite changes in UAE were observed in response to the two treatments; UAE decreased by 40% in the captopril group and by 40% in nifedipine-treated patients. These results indicate that intrarenal changes may be crucial with respect to the effect of therapy on UAE. It is suggested that only agents which reduce FF and probably intraglomerular capillary pressure, such as converting enzyme inhibitors, alter UAE and may possibly interfere with the course of incipient diabetic nephropathy in normotensive patients.", 
    "87": "To examine a possible role of endogenous bradykinin in the regulation of blood pressure (BP) and renal blood flow (RBF), a newly synthesized competitive antagonist of bradykinin (B4147) was studied in anesthetized rats. Also, the question of whether the hypotensive effect of the converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, is mediated partly by an accumulation of endogenous bradykinin was considered. The intravenous infusion of B4147 (25 micrograms/min) inhibited the depressor effect of exogenous bradykinin (0.5 microgram, i.v.) by 69%. After an intravenous injection of B4147 at doses of 25, 50 and 100 micrograms, BP increased and RBF decreased in a dose-dependent fashion. The increase in BP was not blocked by pretreatment with an angiotensin II antagonist (1-Sar-8-Ile angiotensin II; 20 micrograms/kg per min) or an alpha 1-blocker (prazosin; 0.1 mg/kg). The administration of captopril (1 mg/kg) decreased mean BP from 110 +/- 3.5 to 71 +/- 1.9 mmHg (P less than 0.001). However, the injection of B4147 (50 micrograms) after the administration of captopril elicited an increase in BP of 43% of the initial decrease induced by captopril. These results suggest that the effects of B4147 on BP and RBF are not mediated through angiotensin II or sympathetic alpha 1-stimulation. Endogenous bradykinin could contribute to the maintenance of BP and RBF in anesthetized rats, probably counter-balancing the vasoconstrictor mechanisms. It is also suggested that bradykinin may partly participate in the acute hypotensive effect induced by the converting enzyme inhibitor captopril.", 
    "88": "The purpose of this multicenter randomised, double-blind and cross-over study was to compare the antihypertensive effects of labetalol (L) and captopril (C) in 42 moderate hypertensive patients (mean age: 52 years). The drugs were given during two 4-weeks periods at the end of which the systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressures (DBP) were measured at rest in supine and standing positions. The assessment of the quality of life was realized with 4 scales completed by the practitioner [anxiety, depression, well-being, visual analog scale (VAS)] and 4 scales of auto-assessment completed by the patient [2 VAS, well-being, sub-scale of pleasure]. At the end of the first treatment's period (D28), both drugs had decreased significantly supine SBP and DBP (p less than 0.001), standing DBP (L = p less than 0.01; C = p less than 0.05), while only L lowered supine SBP (p less than 0.01). The cross-over analysis was unable to conclude, due to the number of patients and a significant interaction which reduced its power. Thus the effect of the first treatment's period seemed to influence the efficacy of the second one. The percentages of patients with a controlled BP were respectively: after 4 weeks of treatment, L = 61 p. 100 vs C = 42 p. 100 and at the end of study (D56), L = 67 p. 100 vs C = 64 p. 100. The cross-over analysis didn't show any difference between the effects of L and C on the quality of life.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "89": "The acute effects of captopril and dobutamine, alone and in combination, on left ventricular contractility were assessed from left ventricular end-systolic pressure-volume and pressure-shortening relations in 6 patients with severe end-stage cardiac failure. Dobutamine was given by constant intravenous infusion on two occasions 48 hours apart, on one of these occasions the patient also received oral captopril in a dose of 37 +/- 12 mg 6-hourly. Pressures and cardiac index were measured, and left ventricular volumes and ejection fraction computed from simultaneously recorded radionuclide ventriculography. Dobutamine alone did not cause a statistically significant increase in stroke index, stroke work index, cardiac index and ejection fraction, although pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and right atrial pressure fell (P less than 0.05). There was no change in systemic or pulmonary vascular resistance nor in arterial blood pressure. Following administration of captopril, diastolic arterial pressure decreased (P less than 0.05), and the dobutamine challenge produced a greater and significant rise in stroke and stroke work index (P less than 0.05) and cardiac index (P less than 0.01). The left ventricular contractile state was unaltered by captopril but appeared to increase with dobutamine and more so during combined therapy with captopril and dobutamine, indicating a synergistic effect of the two drugs when given in combination.", 
    "90": "We studied the effectiveness of 50 mg captopril in reducing blood pressure in 27 elderly hypertensive patients. Comparison with a placebo group has shown a significant difference 20 and 60 min after administration (dissolved in the mouth). A significant decrease in blood pressure was found at each observation time (10, 20 and 60 min) in the captopril-treated group, whereas in the placebo group there was no significant fall after the first 10 min. Therefore, captopril dissolved in the mouth decreases blood pressure more rapidly than with standard oral consumption, and can be considered a first-choice drug when a rapid decrease in blood pressure is desired.", 
    "91": "Hypertensive emergencies, and to a certain extent their treatment, contribute to morbidity and mortality in elderly patients. We studied 22 hospitalized patients, aged 70-90 years, all of whom had moderate essential hypertensive. During acute hypertension, mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure rose to 230 +/- 24 and 120 +/- 22 mmHg, respectively. Symptoms of reduced tissue perfusion/oxygenation and/or organ failure occurred, forcing us to begin antihypertensive therapy. We administered 50 mg of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril sublingually, and within 15 min, systolic blood pressure decreased by an average 60 +/- 16 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure by an average 25 +/- 14 mmHg. There was no significant change in the heart rate. In addition, we treated 22 comparable patients with 10 mg nifedipine sublingually and observed, in four cases, a greater fall in blood pressure (up to 90 mmHg) together with tachycardia. These results show the beneficial effects of captopril in the treatment of hypertensive emergencies in elderly patients. The absence of dangerous side effects indicates that ACE inhibitors can be used as first-choice drugs for the treatment of acute hypertensive crises, even in old age.", 
    "92": "In elderly patients diabetes and hypertension play an important and synergistic role in the development of cardiovascular complications. For this reason therapy must reduce blood pressure without compromising blood glucose control. We investigated the question of whether captopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, can be used without interference to glucose metabolism in diabetics with secondary failure. Ten elderly hypertensive diabetics (diastolic blood pressure greater than 95 mmHg), maintained in good metabolic control using oral hypoglycaemic agents and insulin, were studied before and after 30 days of captopril at 100 mg/day. We measured the following parameters: blood pressure, heart rate, fructosamine and a daily profile for blood glucose and c-peptide. There was a statistically significant reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. No difference was observed in the levels of blood glucose and fructosamine. Insulin secretion as determined by c-peptide levels was not modified, in contrast with findings reported for the use of beta-blockers, diuretics or nifedipine. It seems that captopril is useful and without side effects, even in secondary-failure diabetic patients characterized by unstable metabolic control.", 
    "93": "Elderly diabetic patients with hypertension present a difficult medical management problem. The guidelines published by the 1987 Working Group on Hypertension in Diabetes in the United States suggest a stepped care approach to drug therapy in these patients. The stepped care strategy is to add a series of antihypertensive medications sequentially until the blood pressure is controlled. The first step includes one of the following: thiazide diuretics, beta-blockers, alpha-adrenergic inhibitors, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or calcium channel blockers. The second step adds a second agent from the same group, while the third step adds a vasodilator and step four adds a drug like guanethidine if the combination of other drugs fails. This approach presents many perils in the aged patient with diabetes. In these patients the physician should: (1) limit the use of diuretics and beta-blockers; (2) favour the use of calcium channel blockers and ACE inhibitors; (3) use a substitution approach rather than a stepped care approach; and (4) use monotherapy if possible.", 
    "94": "Both nifedipine and captopril are effective in the treatment of systemic hypertension in the elderly, but their effects on cardiac function in this age group have not been evaluated. We studied the effects of acute oral administration of 20 mg nifedipine and 12.5 mg captopril on systolic and diastolic cardiac function, as evaluated by a radionuclide method, in 14 elderly hypertensives, mean age 73.4 +/- 3.9 years. The radionuclide studies were performed 1 h after ingestion of nifedipine and 1.5 h after captopril, on separate days. Nifedipine accelerated the heart rate whereas captopril slowed it. Nifedipine increased the ejection fraction by 2.6 +/- 14.6% but captopril increased it by 13 +/- 15.3%. Nifedipine reduced the left ventricular peak ejection rate by 4.8 +/- 21.7% whereas captopril increased it by 18 +/- 24.3%. Nifedipine increased the peak filling rate by 14.3 +/- 41.6% and captopril increased it by 27.6 +/- 32.6%. Nifedipine reduced the time to peak filling rate by 24.9 +/- 27.0%, but captopril reduced it by 68.8 +/- 59.6%. All these differences were statistically significant. Therefore, captopril improves some diastolic and systolic parameters of cardiac function more than nifedipine does. Other parameters are impaired by nifedipine but improved by captopril.", 
    "95": "We compared the acute hemodynamic effects of captopril and nitrates in 11 patients with severe congestive heart failure and Grade IV cardiac disability. Pressures were measured using a Swan-Ganz catheter system; cardiac output and stroke index were measured by thermodilution, and left-ventricular (LV) volumes and ejection fraction were calculated simultaneously with the hemodynamic measurements from radionuclide ventriculography. Measurements were made in each of four treatment states: control, sublingual isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) (5 and 15 mg), oral captopril (50 to 200 mg daily) and during combined therapy with captopril and ISDN. Captopril produced a fall in mean arterial pressure (P less than 0.01) from 81 +/- 14 to 72 +/- 13 mm Hg, and a rise in stroke index from 30 +/- 5 to 35 +/- 91/min per m2 (P less than 0.05), while LV ejection fraction increased from 18 +/- 5 to 21 +/- 7% (P less than 0.05). ISDN reduced mean arterial, pulmonary arterial, right-atrial and wedge pressure. The combination of captopril and ISDN produced a greater fall in mean arterial pressure, a further rise in ejection fraction to 22 +/- 8% (P less than 0.05), a fall in systemic (P less than 0.05) and pulmonary vascular resistance (P less than 0.01) and a rise in cardiac (P less than 0.01) and stroke work index (P less than 0.01), while the beneficial effects of ISDN on right-atrial, pulmonary arterial and wedge pressure were again achieved. LV contractility, assessed from end-systolic stress-shortening relations, was essentially unaltered or decreased very slightly. The study showed that combined therapy with captopril and nitrates produced acute hemodynamic benefits superior to those achieved by treatment with captopril or nitrates alone.", 
    "96": "Captopril is an orally active inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and has been widely studied in the treatment of patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension, severe hypertension not responsive to conventional diuretic/beta-adrenoceptor blocker/vasodilator regimens, and patients with chronic congestive heart failure refractory to treatment with a diuretic and digitalis. In patients with mild or moderate essential hypertension, titrated low doses of captopril used alone or in conjunction with a diuretic are similar in efficacy to usual doses of hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone, or beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs, as well as to the other ACE inhibitors. In addition, captopril improved well-being to a greater extent than methyldopa or propranolol in a study designed specifically to determine the effect of treatment on the quality of life of patients with mild or moderate essential hypertension. The earlier demonstrated efficacy of captopril, used with a diuretic and often also with a beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug, in the treatment of severe hypertension refractory to conventional 'triple therapy' has been confirmed in more recent trials which illustrate the generally marked antihypertensive effect of captopril-containing regimens in such patients. Results of initial trials in patients with scleroderma are promising, with control of hypertension and stabilization of renal function in these patients when treated at an early stage of the disease. Several comparative and long term trials of captopril in patients with chronic congestive heart failure refractory to treatment with a diuretic/digitalis regimen clearly demonstrate that initial haemodynamic improvement is maintained and correlates with clinical benefit. A tendency for overall clinical response to captopril to be better than the response to prazosin, hydralazine, nisoldipine or enalapril has been reported. Results of a multicentre comparison with digoxin and placebo indicate that captopril is a suitable alternative to digoxin in patients with mild to moderate heart failure who are receiving maintenance diuretic therapy. The tolerability of captopril has now been studied in many thousands of patients involved in formalized trials and the early impression of poor tolerability can no longer be justified. The use of generally lower dosages of captopril in patients with normal or slightly impaired renal function has resulted in a generally low incidence of rash (0.5 to 4%), dysgeusia (0.1 to 3%), proteinuria (0.5%), neutropenia (0.3% during first 3 months) and symptomatic hypotension (0.1 to 3%). Cough is an infrequent but troublesome effect resulting from ACE inhibition.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "97": "The effect of hypotensive haemorrhage on blood pressure recovery was compared in saline- and streptozotocin-injected rats. Absolute plasma volumes (and calculated blood volumes) were not different between the two groups. After haemorrhage of similar volumes at similar rates, there were no significant differences in the recoveries in blood pressures or heart rates between control and diabetic animals. In other control and diabetic groups, posthaemorrhage treatment with the converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (at 20 min) and the vasopressin (V1-receptor) antagonist d(CH2)5DAVP (at 40 min) did not have any deleterious effects on blood pressure recovery at these times. These results support the proposition that neither the renin-angiotensin system nor vasopressin are importantly involved in blood pressure recovery at these time points after hypotensive haemorrhage in conscious rats. They are also consistent with the lack of difference between untreated control and diabetic groups, despite previous findings showing impairments of renin-angiotensin- and vasopressin-mediated effects after acute hypotension induced by pentolinium in diabetic rats.", 
    "98": "K depletion (KD) prevents the development of hypertension in two-kidney, one-clip renovascular, hypertension [mean arterial pressure: 110 +/- 5 (KD) vs. 142 +/- 3 mmHg in potassium replete (KR); P less than 0.001]. The protective effect of KD is associated with a 60% decrease in angiotensin II (ANG II) pressor responsiveness and a 40% decrease in ANG II binding to mesenteric artery particles from rats with renovascular hypertension (receptor number 117 +/- 16 in KD vs. 165 +/- 14 fmol/mg protein in KR, P less than 0.05). To determine whether decreases in binding could account for decreases in ANG II pressor responsivity, we measured ANG II binding after bilateral nephrectomy or sustained administration of converting-enzyme inhibitor. Both maneuvers resulted in increases in binding, such that total binding and receptor number were greater than in comparably treated KR rats; e.g., after nephrectomy, receptor number was 215 +/- 26 in KD vs. 98 +/- 12 fmol/mg protein in KR, (P less than 0.01). Despite increased binding, the pressor response to ANG II in KD rats, which were nephrectomized or treated with converting-enzyme inhibitor, was still reduced by 50% compared with comparably treated KR rats. To determine whether the decreased ANG II pressor responsivity of KD was caused by cellular K depletion or to increases in ANG H induced by KD, we administered K to KD, ANG II-deficient rats. ANG II pressor responsivity increased, and total binding and receptor number decreased (KD, ANG II- deficient 246 +/ 22 fmol/mg protein; KD, ANG II-deficient + K 91 +/ 16 fmol/mg protein; P less than 0.005) with K.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "99": "The aim of this study was to examine the importance of the renal nerves in mediating the sodium-retaining actions of angiotensin II (ANG II) during chronic sodium deprivation. In seven female dogs the left kidney was denervated and the urinary bladder was split, allowing continuous urine collection from separate innervated and denervated kidneys in the same dog. The dogs were maintained on a low-sodium diet (7 meq/day) for 9 days and then infused with the converting-enzyme inhibitor captopril (CAP, 14 micrograms.kg-1.min-1, 7 days) followed by CAP plus ANG II (10 ng.kg-1.min-1, 7 days). Mean arterial pressure (MAP) fell from a control of 88 +/- 4 (average for 5 days preceding CAP) to 65 +/- 3 mmHg during CAP. Infusion of ANG II along with CAP restored MAP to 97 +/- 5 mmHg. There were no significant differences in urine volume or sodium, potassium, chloride, or osmolar excretions between innervated and denervated kidneys during the control period, CAP infusion, or CAP plus ANG II infusion. Norepinephrine content was reduced by 99 +/- 1% in denervated kidneys. Because a differential response was not observed between innervated and denervated kidneys during ANG II blockade or infusion of ANG II, we conclude that the renal nerves do not play a major role in mediating the sodium-retaining effects of ANG II during chronic sodium restriction.", 
    "100": "We compared the effects of protein restriction and converting-enzyme inhibition by captopril (CAP) on urinary protein excretion (UP) and progressive glomerular sclerosis (GS) in an experimental model of nephrosis induced in rats by a single injection of Adriamycin (ADR) at a dose of 3 mg/kg. Two isocaloric diets with a 6% and 22% (NP) protein content were used. Experimental groups were started on NP, on NP plus CAP (500 mg/liter) or on an isocaloric diet with a 6% protein content at day 2 after ADR injection and followed for 38 days. According to a cross-over design, groups were then switched to the alternative diet or maintained on the original diet, whereas in one CAP-treated group CAP treatment was stopped. All groups were followed for another 34 to 42 days and then sacrificed. Results showed that UP and the incidence of GS were significantly reduced in groups on the isocaloric diet with a 6% protein content during the full length or the second half of the observation period. In contrast, CAP had no effect on UP or on the incidence of GS, although systolic blood pressure was significantly reduced. Renal function studies performed in separate groups on the same regimes at 5 weeks after induction of ADR nephrosis, showed that LP had lowered glomerular filtration rate numerically and renal plasma flow significantly, whereas CAP was found to have no effect on glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow. Glomerular volumes were increased in proteinuric rats on both NP diet and NP diet with CAP treatment. The present study confirms earlier reports that in ADR-nephrotic rats, protein restriction attenuates UP and GS without affecting systolic blood pressure, whereas converting-enzyme inhibition does not have this beneficial effect although systolic blood pressure is lowered. GS seems to be related to glomerular extension and hypertrophy. The effect of protein restriction may be partially hemodynamically mediated by afferent vasoconstriction, resulting in a decrease in glomerular filtration rate and a reduction in protein flux across the ADR-induced large pore defects.", 
    "101": "The effects of two potent vasodilating drugs, captopril (C) (25 mg tid), nicardipine (N) (20 mg tid), and placebo (P) were evaluated and compared, in 10 men (mean age of sixty-five years) with intermittent claudication from moderate to severe multilevel chronic occlusive arterial disease (COAD) of the lower extremity, by use of the Doppler ultrasonic method, at rest and after Carter's exercise test. All the examined subjects were normotensive, without diabetes or cardiopathy; all have been smokers. The eight-week total protocol consisted of an initial two-week placebo run-in period followed by two active drug phases and a two-week placebo phase, according to a double-blind, randomized, crossover design. At the end of each two-week period, ankle-arm index (AAI) and, following exercise, onset of lower extremity discomfort time (ODT), duration of exercise (ET), decrease of ankle systolic pressure after test (APD), and recovery time (RT) were determined. Moreover, at rest, just after exercise, and after recovery, simultaneous common femoral artery velocity waves were recorded and analyzed by a quantitative approach to detect the peripheral vasomotor adjustments. None of the patients required the withdrawal of the active treatments. Compared with P, C significantly reduced APD and RT, and N reduced RT and AAI; furthermore N caused a significant decrease in ODT, whereas C showed a trend, although not statistically significant, to increase ODT. Neither active therapy modified ET. These results suggest that C and N have different short-term effects on peripheral circulation in COAD. During exercise, C induces hemodynamic improvement in the ischemic lower extremity probably by inhibition of the sympathetic system and consequent reduction in collateral vessel vasoconstriction.", 
    "102": "1. The pharmacokinetics, hormonal and haemodynamic responses at rest and during challenges with angiotensin I (blood pressure), isoprenaline (heart rate), and noradrenaline (blood pressure) were investigated in six healthy male volunteers following a 1 week treatment with placebo, propranolol (120 mg day-1), cilazapril (2, 5 mg day-1), and a combination of both in a double-blind cross-over design. 2. Both drugs reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure by about 7 mm Hg as compared with placebo. After coadministration, this drop in blood pressure was doubled and lasted longer than after the administration of the individual components. 3. Following cilazapril, a pronounced increase in plasma renin activity (PRA) was found (factor approximately 10 at drug peak concentrations). Coadministration of both drugs resulted only in a moderate increase in the PRA (factor approximately 3). Significant changes in plasma catecholamines were not observed. 4. Propranolol shifted the isoprenaline dose-effect curve to the right, and cilazapril that of angiotensin I, irrespective of the presence of the other drug. Cilazapril tended to shift the noradrenaline dose-effect curve somewhat to the right. 5. The gain of the baroreceptor reflex (angiotensin-stimulation) was not influenced by cilazapril but was lowered by propranolol, irrespective of the presence of the ACE inhibitor. 6. Except for a statistically not significant decrease in the peak concentrations of each drug during the combined therapy, a pharmacokinetic interaction between the two drugs was not found.", 
    "103": "The regional hemodynamic effects of rat atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) (1 and 10 nmol) were measured in the same conscious Brattleboro rats in water-replete and in water-deprived states (14 h). In the latter condition, the effects of ANP were compared with those of captopril (3.2 mumol). In rats in the water-replete state, the low dose of ANP had no significant effects on mean arterial pressure (MAP) or renal, superior mesenteric, or hindquarter vascular resistances, although heart rate (HR) showed a transient increase. The high dose of ANP caused a fall in MAP and an increase in HR. Renal and hindquarter vascular beds showed dilatation followed by constriction; there was a mesenteric vasoconstriction only. In rats in the water-deprived state, the low dose of ANP caused a marked fall in MAP but only a transient increase in HR; there was marked hindquarters vasodilation. The high dose of ANP caused dramatic hypotension and bradyarrhythmia; an initial hindquarter vasodilation gave way to vasoconstriction; renal and mesenteric vasoconstrictions also occurred.

Basal diastolic blood pressure was decreased by captopril, ramiprilate (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors), saralasin (an angiotensin II receptor antagonist), pepstatin A (a protease inhibitor with renin antagonistic properties) and by functional nephrectomy (ligation of both renal hili), but was not affected by procaterol (a beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist), nebivolol (a beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist) and ICI 118,551 (erythro-dl-1-(7-methylindan-4-yloxy)-3-isopropylaminobut an-2-ol; a beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist). 2. The vasopressor response induced by electrical stimulation of the preganglionic sympathetic nerve fibres was increased by procaterol, whereas the increase in blood pressure evoked by exogenous noradrenaline was not affected. The pressor response to both electrical stimulation and exogenous noradrenaline was decreased by captopril, ramiprilate, saralasin and nephrectomy but was not affected by nebivolol and ICI 118,551. 3. The facilitatory effect of procaterol on the neurogenic, electrically induced pressor response, which was also obtained when basal blood pressure was decreased by nephrectomy and increased by Lys8-vasopressin, was abolished by ICI 118,551 but not affected by nebivolol. Under none of these experimental conditions did procaterol alter the vasopressor response to exogenous noradrenaline. 4. The facilitatory effect of procaterol on the neurogenic, electrically induced rise in blood pressure was abolished by captopril, ramiprilate, saralasin and pepstatin A.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "105": "Antihypertensive therapy is effective in elderly patients, at least in those under 80 years old. Stepped care may still serve as a therapeutic framework which is modified to fit the individual elderly patient, according to the risk: benefit ratio. However, there are no risk-free drugs and no antihypertensive agent is universally effective. The elderly are probably more sensitive than younger patients to the adverse effects of antihypertensive drugs, for various reasons, among which are age- and disease-related changes that can lead to altered pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics. Multiple pathology and multiple drug therapy is likely to lead to an increased number of drug-drug and drug-disease interactions in the elderly. The elderly are probably most at risk from side effects that influence the cardiovascular and the central nervous system.", 
    "106": "This study examined the contribution of each primary pressor system to resting arterial pressure and the ability of each to maintain pressure in the absence of the other systems in conscious dogs. In dogs with intact carotid sinus baroreflexes, ganglionic blockade (GB) reduced blood pressure by 13 +/- 3 mmHg, whereas blockade of the renin-angiotensin (RAS) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) systems did not significantly alter arterial pressure. After removal of the other two systems, the depressor response to blockade of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) with hexamethonium and atropine was significantly augmented (-33 +/- 3 mmHg), whereas captopril (CAP) blockade of the RAS reduced pressure 14 +/- 4 mmHg, and AVP blockade decreased pressure 12 +/- 2 mmHg. In sinoaortic-denervated (SAD) dogs, the SNS exhibited a greater contribution (28 +/- 4 mmHg) to resting pressure compared with intact, and the role of the RAS (10 +/- 2 mmHg) was also augmented, whereas the effects of AVP blockade were unaltered. Effects of GB and CAP were unaltered after blockade of the other systems in SAD animals, whereas the depressor response to AVP antagonist (-13 +/- 2 mmHg) was significantly augmented. Results indicate the SNS is the primary pressor system in resting intact or SAD conscious dogs, whereas the RAS also contributes to resting blood pressure in SAD animals. The ability of the SNS alone to maintain arterial pressure after acute removal of the other systems is also significantly greater than that of AVP or the RAS.",

Celiprolol provides 24-hour control of blood pressure and in formal clinical trials has been found superior to a placebo and of equal efficacy to other commonly used beta-blocking drugs. It has also been found to be equally as effective as enalapril in lowering the resting blood pressure and superior in controlling the increases in blood pressure and heart rate during exercise. Celiprolol is known to exert a beneficial effect on the atheroprotective components of the risk factors for coronary heart disease, such as cholesterol triglyceride, and fibrinogen. Therefore the primary attributes of beta-blockade are uniquely advanced by celiprolol's ancillary pharmacologic activities.",

Twelve out-patients (mean age 48.6 years - SD 7) with mild-to-moderate hypertension and supine diastolic blood pressure (Hawksley Random Zero Manometer) greater than 100 mmHg at the end of a 3-week placebo wash-out received, in double-blind and random order, A 100 mg daily, E 20 mg daily and placebo for 4 weeks each, according to a 3 x 3 latin square design. A 24-hour non-invasive ABPM (Spacelabs ICR 5200) was performed at the end of each of the 3 periods. In respect to placebo, both A and E produced a 24-h antihypertensive effect. The frequency of diastolic blood pressure values above 90 mmHg was 50.0% after placebo, 24.5% after A and 28.9% after E (a 51% reduction after A and a 42.3% reduction after E in respect to placebo - both p less than .05). Systolic blood pressure profiles differed less than 5 mmHg between placebo and A, as well as between placebo and E, between 9:30 and 10:30. Diastolic blood pressure profiles differed less than 5 mmHg between placebo and A over 2 h (between 2:30 and 3:30, and between 10:30 and 11:30), and between placebo and E over 2 other h (between 9:30 and 10:30, and between 11:30 and 12:30).

Intravenous injection of either 0.4 mg/kg benazepril hydrochloride or enalapril significantly reduced mean arterial pressure (MAP) and significantly increased renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate over a 2 hr period. Urine volume and sodium excretion increased, while urine osmolality decreased following i.v. injection of either benazepril hydrochloride or enalapril. The results presented in this study demonstrate that the new and structurally novel converting enzyme inhibitor benazepril hydrochloride has potent actions on renal function which are essentially identical to those of enalapril.", 
    "110": "CS-622 is a prodrug type ACE inhibitor with a thiazepin ring. Its active form, CS-622 diacid, was slightly more potent than enalaprilat in inhibiting ACE isolated from rabbit lung. The inhibitory potency of CS-622 diacid on isolated rat aorta was 3 times that of enalaprilat. The inhibitory action of enalaprilat was abolished quickly by washing the aortic strip with drug-free solution, whereas that of CS-622 diacid was abolished only slowly. This difference suggests that CS-622 diacid binds to vascular ACE more firmly than enalaprilat. By oral administration, CS-622 was 3 times more potent than enalapril, and its onset of action was faster than that of enalapril, suggesting that the conversion of CS-622 to its active diacid occurs faster than the conversion of enalapril. Although CS-622 diacid was only slightly more potent than enalaprilat by intravenous administration, it had a longer duration than enalaprilat. Elimination of renal excretory function potentiated the action of captopril but not that of CS-622, suggesting that unlike captopril, only a small portion of CS-622 is excreted through the kidney.", 
    "111": "CV-5975, (R)-3-[(S)-1-carboxy-5-(4-piperidyl)pentyl]amino-4-oxo- 2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1,5-benzothiazepine-5-acetic acid, was found to inhibit rabbit lung angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity with an IC50 of 3.1 x 10(-9) M and a Ki of 2.6 x 10(-9) M, inhibit the angiotensin I (A-I)-induced contraction of the guinea pig ileum with an IC50 of 1.3 x 10(-8) M, and augment the bradykinin (BK)-induced contraction of the ileum with an AC50 of 9.2 x 10(-10) M. The activity of CV-5975 was comparable to or slightly more potent than that of enalaprilat. The overall inhibition constant (Ki*), calculated from a steady-state analysis of enzyme reactions, was 4.4 x 10(-12) M for CV-5975; this indicates that the inhibition was about 5 times more potent than that of enalaprilat (2.0 x 10(-11) M). In rats, CV-5975 (0.03 and 0.3 mg/kg, i.v. and 3 and 10 mg/kg, p.o.) inhibited the A-I-induced pressor action more potently and for a longer period than did the corresponding doses of enalaprilat and enalapril. CV-5975 and enalapril (3 mg/kg, p.o.) augmented the BK-induced depressor action to a similar extent. In dogs, CV-5975 (0.3 and 1 mg/kg, p.o.) markedly inhibited the A-I-induced pressor action in a dose related manner, and the duration of this inhibitory activity was longer than with the corresponding doses of enalapril. These data provide evidence for the proposal that CV-5975 is a highly potent and long lasting ACE inhibitor.", 
    "112": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril in a group of 30 patients (mean age 73.3 years) with moderate hypertension and normal haematological and chemical parameters (170 +/- 8.1 mmHg systolic and 104 +/- 5.8 mmHg diastolic blood pressure), who were receiving diuretic therapy with chlorthalidone (12.5 mg/day). This therapy caused a significant decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (to 165 +/- 6.7 and 98 +/- 4.7 mmHg, respectively; P less than 0.001) but it also induced hypokalaemia (3.04 +/- 0.7 mmol/l; P less than 0.001) and multiple (greater than 10/h) and complex premature ventricular depolarizations (2nd, 3rd and 4th Lown grade). Enalapril treatment (5 mg/day for 5 days and 10 mg thereafter) was added to the diuretic therapy and after 2 months a further decrease in blood pressure was observed (to 158 +/- 5.6 mmHg systolic, P less than 0.001; 87.2 +/- 5.0 mmHg diastolic, P less than 0.001). Moreover, there was a significant reduction in the mean heart rate (from 79 to 72 beats/min, P less than 0.005) and an increase in serum potassium (to 4.19 +/- 0.2 mmol/l; P less than 0.001). In 80% of patients a 24-h dynamic electrocardiogram showed a significant reduction in both the number and complexity of premature ventricular depolarizations. Our findings suggest that ACE inhibitors can be useful in patients developing hypokalaemia during therapy. However, we are not yet able to explain the beneficial effects of enalapril in decreasing the frequency of premature ventricular depolarizations.",

Enalapril 5 mg given 4 hours before operation was associated with a significant reduction in the pressor response associated with intubation (p less than 0.05) and surgical stimulation (p less than 0.005) compared with control. Heart rate changes were similar in the two groups. The role of the renin-angiotensin system in relation to the pressor response to sympathetic stimulation is discussed and it is concluded that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may help improve peri-operative cardiovascular stability.", 
    "114": "1. In guinea-pig isolated lungs perfused with Krebs solution, captopril (10 microM) inhibited the metabolism of bradykinin (Bk) and the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, as measured by bioassay. Captopril significantly enhanced Bk-stimulated output of prostacyclin. 2. In bovine aortic endothelial cells grown on microcarrier beads, captopril (10 microM) did not affect the release of prostacyclin or of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) induced by Bk. 3. Angiotensin I or angiotensin II did not release prostacyclin from guinea-pig isolated lungs or bovine aortic endothelial cells. They were also ineffective as releasers of EDRF from bovine aortic endothelial cells. 4. Thus, activation of angiotensin converting enzyme is not involved in the release of prostacyclin from guinea-pig isolated lungs or bovine aortic endothelial cells, or in release of EDRF from bovine aortic endothelial cells.", 
    "115": "The inter-relationship between the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic behaviour of ACE inhibitors is reviewed. First, some of the methods which have been used to assess the pharmacodynamics of ACE inhibitors in humans are presented. They include humoral assays (e.g. ACE activity in plasma, renin activity, etc.), haemodynamic changes (blood pressure, total peripheral resistance, etc.) and agonist challenges (angiotensin I infusions). Subsequently a pharmacokinetic-dynamic model is described, based on biochemical processes obtained after ACE inhibition, which seems to be useful for the interpretation of the complex processes. The various correlations between plasma drug concentration on the one hand and plasma ACE activity, angiotensin II concentration in plasma or blood pressure on the other, are discussed on the basis of this model. From the model obtained it becomes obvious that under many circumstances the release of the inhibitor from ACE binding is the step which in fact determines the pharmacodynamically relevant elimination rate of the drug at low concentrations, whereas at high concentrations the elimination of the drug is mainly dependent on kidney (and/or liver) elimination rate. The dynamic-kinetic correlations are then presented for some ACE inhibitors in various disease states: arterial hypertension, heart failure, old age, renal failure, liver disease. In a final section the kinetic and dynamic relevance of interactions of ACE inhibitors with food and other drugs is described (e.g. prostaglandin inhibitors, diuretics, digoxin and cimetidine). Despite the great body of literature which deals with the kinetic and/or dynamic properties of ACE inhibitors, precise knowledge of the relationship between their kinetic and dynamic behaviour is rather limited and there is a clear need for further studies to elucidate this complex topic, thereby improving therapeutic possibilities with these useful new compounds.", 
    "116": "The tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) mechanism was evaluated in the nonclipped kidney of Goldblatt hypertensive rats from both stop flow pressure (SFP) and single nephron glomerular filtration rate (SNGFR) responses to step increases in late proximal perfusion rate from 0 to 40 nl/min. During control conditions, increases in late proximal perfusion rate produced flow dependent decreases in SFP and SNGFR with maximal values of 10.2 +/- 1.0 mm Hg and 12.9 +/- 2.5 nl/min, values similar to those obtained in normal rats. During ACE inhibition (MK 422; 0.6 mg/kg/hr), arterial pressure decreased from 168 +/- 8 to 137 +/- 7 mm Hg and there was a marked attenuation in the magnitude of SFP feedback responses (delta = 2.5 +/- 0.3 mm Hg). SNGFR feedback responses, however, were not significantly impaired. Direct decreases in renal arterial pressure reduced control SFP but SFP feedback responses were maintained, indicating that the attenuated SFP feedback responses during ACE inhibition were not due to decreased arterial pressure. Superimposed infusion of angiotensin II during ACE inhibition partially restored SFP feedback responses. In contrast, norepinephrine infusion did not result in a similar restoration of SFP feedback sensitivity. These results indicate that the nonclipped kidney of Goldblatt hypertensive rats has an intact TGF mechanism as assessed from SFP and SNGFR feedback responses. Furthermore, ACE inhibition attenuates SFP but not SNGFR feedback responses, and systemic angiotensin II infusions can restore SFP feedback responsiveness towards normal.", 
    "117": "To determine the effect of enalapril maleate and low-dose hydrochlorothiazide therapy on blood pressure and glucose and lipid homeostasis in hypertensive type II diabetic patients, we treated nine of these patients sequentially with placebo, hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg/d with supplemental potassium chloride), and enalapril (10 to 20 mg/d). Sitting blood pressure fell significantly and to comparable levels with both hydrochlorothiazide and enalapril monotherapy. Enalapril monotherapy was associated with a slight, but not significant, fall in fasting blood glucose levels and with a significant fall in hemoglobin A1c levels. This improved glucose homeostasis could not be explained satisfactorily by changes in peripheral insulin sensitivity or hepatic glucose output, determined with the euglycemic clamp technique, or by changes in fasting serum insulin levels or monocyte insulin binding. In these low doses, hydrochlorothiazide did not worsen glucose homeostasis. Serum total cholesterol levels were significantly lower with enalapril therapy than with hydrochlorothiazide therapy or with placebo, and serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels did not change significantly with either treatment. Thus, by providing effective blood pressure control and beneficial metabolic effects, enalapril therapy appears ideal for treatment of hypertension in diabetic patients. Similarly, low-dose hydrochlorothiazide therapy appears to have fewer metabolic complications in these patients and is, therefore, a logical alternative to substitute for, or add to, enalapril therapy.", 
    "118": "The antihypertensive efficacy and renal effects of enalapril maleate therapy were evaluated in 13 hypertensive patients with chronic renal failure. Enalapril was administered as follows: alone; added to furosemide, clonidine hydrochloride, or atenolol; or in combination with any of the aforementioned drugs. Three patients did not complete the study; uncontrolled hypertension was the cause in two of these patients. In the remaining ten patients, short-term (mean +/- SD, 63 +/- 9 days) enalapril maleate therapy decreased the patient's seated blood pressure from 161/98 +/- 19/8 to 130/80 +/- 13/7 mm Hg. Furosemide was administered to eight patients; the dose of concomitant sympatholytic therapy was decreased in five of five patients. Serum potassium concentration increased from 4.1 +/- 0.3 to 4.5 +/- 0.3 mmol/L. Levels of urinary total protein excretion decreased from 2.23 +/- 2.05 to 1.08 +/- 1.45 g/d. Renal function (creatinine clearance, 0.58 +/- 0.21 mL/s) did not change from baseline. During long-term therapy, the rate of progression of renal insufficiency seemed to slacken in three of four patients with diabetic nephropathy. Thus enalapril can reduce blood pressure and proteinuria in hypertensive patients with chronic renal insufficiency. The possibility that enalapril can slow the progression of diabetic nephropathy remains to be confirmed by future studies.", 
    "119": "Our objective was to investigate the integrated pulmonary vascular response of conscious dogs to combined inhibition of the autonomic nervous system, arginine vasopressin (V1) receptors (vasopressinergic V1), and converting enzyme to identify the overall influence of these three major neurohumoral mechanisms in vascular regulation of the pulmonary circulation. Multipoint pulmonary vascular pressure-cardiac index (P/Q) plots were generated by graded constriction of the thoracic inferior vena cava, which produced stepwise decreases in Q. When compared with the P/Q relationship measured in intact conscious dogs, combined neurohumoral block resulted in active, nonflow-dependent pulmonary vasodilation. A second objective was to assess the extent to which cyclooxygenase pathway inhibition modified both the intact P/Q relationship and the pulmonary vasodilator response to combined neurohumoral block. Cyclooxygenase inhibition alone (either indomethacin or sodium meclofenamate) resulted in active, nonflow-dependent pulmonary vasoconstriction. Moreover, the pulmonary vasodilation in response to combined neurohumoral block was entirely abolished following cyclooxygenase inhibition. Thus the integrated pulmonary vascular response of conscious dogs to combined neurohumoral block is active vasodilation. This response appears to be mediated by metabolites of the cyclooxygenase pathway.", 
    "120": "Comparison of the effect of captopril and enalaprilat was made on mean systemic arterial blood pressure (BP), renal blood flow (RBF), and renal vascular resistance (RVR) of conscious sodium-replete and sodium-restricted dogs (plasma renin activity = 6.66 ng angiotensin I.ml-1.h-1). BP was decreased by -8 +/- 2 mmHg and RBF was increased by 34 +/- 12 ml/min with captopril given intravenously and by -5 +/- 2 mmHg and 28 +/- 7 ml/min with enalaprilat in sodium-replete dogs. The respective changes in BP and RBF in sodium-restricted dogs were -29 +/- 2 mmHg and 62 +/- 12 ml/min with captopril and -25 +/- 6 mmHg and 53 +/- 18 ml/min with enalaprilat. Saralasin infused intra-arterially to the kidney significantly blocked the increase in RBF seen after angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition in sodium-replete dogs, and reduced the increase in RBF in sodium-restricted dogs, but the latter effect was not statistically significant. A more moderate increase in plasma renin activity was established in another group of sodium-restricted dogs, and saralasin was administered intravenously instead of intra-arterially. Enalaprilat increased RBF in these dogs in the presence of a saralasin blockade (42 +/- 7 ml/min), and this effect was not significantly changed by prior administration of indomethacin (28 +/- 6 ml/min). The results suggest that blockade of the influence of the renin-angiotensin system and possibly another vasodilator mechanism, such as kinin potentiation, account for the increase in RBF after ACE inhibition in the low-sodium state.", 
    "121": "Functional and morphologic measurements were performed in Munich-Wistar rats after a single central venous injection of puromycin aminonucleoside (PA) or saline vehicle (sham). During phase I, PA rats exhibited overt nephrotic syndrome and impaired glomerular filtration, primarily due to a reduction in the glomerular capillary ultrafiltration coefficient. The morphologic counterpart of the latter consisted of effacement of glomerular epithelial cell foot processes and decrease in the number of filtration slit diaphragms. Administration of the angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI) enalapril to PA rats did not ameliorate glomerular dysfunction. During phase II, PA rats exhibited spontaneous resolution of proteinuria, impaired function, and morphologic abnormalities. However, PA rats now demonstrated marked glomerular capillary hypertension and continued, albeit lesser, reductions in the ultrafiltration coefficient. Concurrent CEI administration modestly lowered systemic arterial pressure, and normalized the glomerular capillary hydraulic pressure and ultrafiltration coefficient. Additional rats were studied during phase III, 70 wk after injection. In PA rats, prior glomerular hypertension was associated with development of recurrent proteinuria and extensive glomerular sclerosis, whereas concurrent CEI administration limited these parameters to values comparable to those in sham rats. Glomerular hypertension thus may explain the development of glomerular sclerosis and renal failure long after an episode of acute glomerular injury.", 
    "122": "The immediate and short-term effects of lisinopril, a new converting enzyme inhibitor, on systemic and regional hemodynamics, cardiac structure and function and humoral indexes were evaluated in 10 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. A single oral dose of 5 mg lisinopril reduced mean arterial pressure from 118 to 104 mm Hg (p less than 0.01) and significantly increased (p less than 0.05) all load-dependent indexes of ventricular function (i.e., ejection fraction, velocity of circumferential fiber shortening and fractional fiber shortening rate). After 10 to 12 weeks of once-daily administration of lisinopril, mean arterial pressure remained reduced over a full 24-hour period (p less than 0.01), and was mediated through arteriolar dilation as expressed by the close correlation (r = 0.93, p less than 0.01) between changes in mean arterial pressure and changes in total peripheral resistance. Cardiac index decreased from 3.06 to 2.68 liters/min/m2 (p less than 0.01) without correlation to the decrease in arterial pressure (r = 0.06). Despite this reduction in cardiac index, renal blood flow increased from 861 to 1,053 ml/min (p less than 0.05) and renal vascular resistance decreased from 14 to 9 units (p less than 0.01). Left ventricular mass index decreased from 124 to 109 g/m2 (p less than 0.05), and left ventricular function remained unchanged. Thus, the decrease in arterial pressure produced by lisinopril was associated with improved renal hemodynamics and reduced left ventricular mass.",

The resulting deblocked N-1 peptides possess an increased positive charge and are therefore retained to a greater extent by the column. Salt gradient elution in a pH 3 mobile phase was then used to recover the desired peptides and the purified deblocked peptides were directly subjected to N-terminal sequence analysis. The same digests were also chromatographed on a C18 reversed-phase column using standard trifluoroacetic acid-acetonitrile gradient elution. The elution order for the parent peptide and the N-1 peptide on the reversed-phase column was reversed from that on the Sulfoethyl Aspartamide column and the resolution of the two peptides obtained on the reversed-phase column was less than that observed on the cation-exchange column. In addition, the Sulfoethyl Aspartamide column was shown to be useful to monitor the extent of N-terminal glutamine cyclization formed during peptide purification and storage.",

    "141": "Seven patients with glomerular proteinuria and hypertension (six with biopsy confirmation of glomerulonephritis, one with proteinuria after unilateral nephrectomy) were randomly given, for 14 days each, a calcium antagonist and then a conversion enzyme inhibitor, or vice versa, following a 14-day pause of all medication. Fractional albuminuria rose significantly during administration of calcium antagonists (P less than 0.05), while it decreased significantly during administration of converting enzyme inhibitor (P less than 0.05). The explanation for this finding may be that calcium antagonists raise glomerular capillary pressure by dilating the afferent arterioles, while converting enzyme inhibitors predominantly cause dilatation of the efferent arterioles.", 
    "142": "Calcium antagonists decrease the ability of the kidney to autoregulate renal blood flow (RBF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Therefore, when afferent renovascular resistance is elevated, as in essential hypertension, there is a resultant increase in RBF and GFR with the administration of calcium antagonists. These agents also induce a marked natriuresis because of direct tubular action through unknown mechanisms. The natriuresis can be dissociated from renal and systemic hemodynamic actions, indicating that the decreased sodium reabsorption could override other compensatory mechanisms explaining the absence of sodium retention during the treatment. The renal effects of converting enzyme inhibitors (CEIs) can be explained by the reduction of intrarenal formation in angiotensin II. Because the activation of the renin-angiotensin system is mainly responsible for inducing sodium retention during a decrease in systemic blood pressure, CEIs could have a protecting effect without disturbing other homeostatic mechanisms. CEIs decrease efferent glomerular resistance, reducing capillary pressure and thereby reducing GFR. This effect is not translated in sodium retention because the reduction of GFR is mild during captopril administration in kidneys with normal or increased renal perfusion pressure. At low renal perfusion pressure, the reduced glomerular afferent vasoconstriction can compromise GFR, leading to renal insufficiency. Although these situations are not likely to be encountered during the treatment of uncomplicated essential hypertension, in severe hypertension with hypertrophy of pre-glomerular vessels, glomerular perfusion may decrease. Combination therapy of calcium antagonists and CEIs has been reported to be an effective treatment of severe hypertension. Currently, little information is available on the manner in which renal function is affected by simultaneous administration of both drugs.", 
    "143": "The efficacy and safety of sustained-release diltiazem, 60 to 180 mg twice daily, was compared with that of captopril, 25 to 75 mg twice daily, alone and in combination, in 132 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension (supine diastolic blood pressure [BP] 95 to 114 mm Hg). All patients received placebo for 4 to 6 weeks, followed by randomization to diltiazem or captopril during the double-blind monotherapy phase. Either study drug was titrated over 6 weeks to achieve a goal supine diastolic BP reduction of at least 10 mm Hg and a diastolic BP of less than 90 mm Hg. Patients achieving the goal BP reduction were maintained on monotherapy for an additional 8 weeks. Patients not achieving the treatment goal after 8 weeks with either drug alone received the other drug in combination, titrated to achieve goal BP response. Both drugs lowered BP significantly and, at the doses used, diltiazem had a greater effect on diastolic BP than did captopril. The mean changes from baseline at week 8 were -10.6 and -7.3 mm Hg, respectively, (p = 0.01). Goal BP was achieved in 38% of patients taking diltiazem monotherapy and in 34% of patients taking captopril monotherapy. There were no significant differences between diltiazem and captopril in diastolic or systolic BP reductions by race or age. The addition of alternate therapy for non-goal achievers at week 8 resulted in significant reductions in diastolic and systolic BP by week 16.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "144": "We designed phethiol (1-amino-1-benzyl-2-mercaptoethane) as a potent and selective inhibitor of Zn-containing aminopeptidases. This compound inhibited purified aminopeptidase M (EC.3.4.11.2) with a Ki of 5 nM but was at least 1000 times less potent against other metallopeptidases comprising angiotensin-converting enzyme EC 3.4.15.1), enkephalinase (EC 3.4.24.11), thermolysin (EC 3.4.24.4), or dipeptidylaminopeptidases. Phethiol alone significantly but partially protected endogenous (Met5) enkephalin released from depolarized brain slices, total protection being achieved when it was associated with an enkephalinase inhibitor. In order to obtain a parenterally-active inhibitor of cerebral aminopeptidases, the prodrug carbaphetiol, a readily hydrolyzable S-phenylcarbamoyl derivative of phethiol, was designed. Carbaphethiol (i.v.) elicited a rapid rise in mouse striatal level of Tyr-Gly-Gly, a characteristic extracellular metabolite of enkephalins. Carbapethiol alone and, even more, when associated with an enkephalinase inhibitor, exerted a potent naloxone-reversible antinociceptive activity. Carbaphethiol appears as the first parenterally-active inhibitor of cerebral aminopeptidases, potentially useful in neuropeptides degradation studies and as a pain-suppressing agent.",

    "146": "In pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs, the increase in the renal norepinephrine secretion rate elicited by renal nerve stimulation (1 Hz) during infusion of angiotensin I (15 ng/kg/min) was partially but significantly inhibited (by 21-37%) after dosing with cilazaprilat (0.1 mg/kg), an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, accompanied by a decrease in the renal venous plasma norepinephrine concentration. These results may suggest that cilazaprilat exerts at least a part of its hypotensive effect through decreasing the facilitatory action of endogenous angiotensin II on adrenergic transmission.", 
    "147": "1. The constriction produced by a single deep breath was measured simultaneously in two adjacent hand veins in normal volunteers. One vein was infused with angiotensin II (ANG II) while the other acted as a control. 2. At a dose lower than that required to produce direct venous constriction (1 pmol/min), ANG II significantly augmented the constriction caused by a deep breath in eight subjects (P less than 0.01). The same dose had no effect on the venoconstriction caused by infused noradrenaline (NA) in a further six subjects. 3. It is concluded that ANG II at low doses may cause venoconstriction indirectly by augmenting sympathetically induced venous tone via a presynaptic mechanism. This observation may help to explain the apparent venodilating property of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in clinical situations where the renin-angiotensin system is stimulated.", 
    "148": "To assess the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition with quinapril on blood lipid profile, serum total cholesterol and triglycerides, together with high-density and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were analysed in 23 hypertensive patients receiving either placebo (7 patients) or quinapril hydrochloride (16 patients). After 12 weeks of therapy there were no significant changes in blood lipids in either group. No unfavourable changes in blood lipid profile were observed even after 1 year of therapy with quinapril hydrochloride in 13 patients.", 
    "149": "In renovascular hypertension adaptive mechanisms in the poststenotic kidney are a probable cause of the 20 to 25% false-negative findings during rapid sequence urography or [123I]o-iodohippurate renography. We blocked the renin-angiotensin system in an effort to increase the yield of these diagnostic procedures. Chronically instrumented, salt-depleted conscious dogs were used in which a light (n = 5), moderate (n = 4), or severe (n = 2) renal artery stenosis was induced. Before stenosis 10 of the dogs showed no left-right differences with either diagnostic procedure, and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition did not change this result. Two to 3 weeks after induction of a renal artery stenosis, all dogs showed signs of renovascular hypertension. However, only 50% of the renograms and 22% of the urograms showed differences between the two kidneys indicative of the presence of stenosis. After ACE inhibition, all previously negative test results became positive (abnormal) and previously existing left-right differences became more evidence. Electromagnetically measured renal blood flow on the stenotic side did not change during ACE inhibition (146 +/- 13 vs 145 +/- 21 ml/min), whereas contralateral blood flow showed a distinct increase (207 +/- 18 vs 282 +/- 20 ml/min, p less than 0.01). In conclusion, ACE inhibition markedly improves the sensitivity of rapid sequence urography and hippurate renography in the diagnosis of renovascular hypertension in the two-kidney, one clip Goldblatt hypertensive dog. The effects of ACE inhibition on the handling of the different tracers do not appear to be related to its effects on renal blood flow or systemic blood pressure.", 
    "150": "Echocardiography was used to explore regional myocardial contractility in 92 patients with postinfarction cardiosclerosis complicated by heart failure developed in the late postinfarction period. All the patients were shown to display regional myocardial contractile dysfunctions as hypo-, a-, and dyskinesia accompanied with hyperfunction of intact myocardial segments. The most severe asynergy was present in anterior postinfarction scars. Peripheral vasodilators were found to improve contractility in the hypokinetic and intact areas of the myocardium.", 
    "151": "The hypotensive effects of some antihypertensive drugs are augmented under sodium restriction, while those of others are not. The mechanisms of these interactions were theoretically analyzed based on the arterial pressure-natriuresis relationship. Four-week studies were performed in 24 patients with essential hypertension who were given a regular sodium diet (12-15 g of NaCl/d) in the first and third weeks and a sodium-restricted diet (1-3 g/d) in the second and fourth weeks. One of three antihypertensive drugs, 60 mg/d of nicardipine (Ca-antagonist), 120 mg/d of propranolol (beta-blocker) or 150 mg/d of captopril (converting-enzyme inhibitor) was administered in the third and fourth weeks. The mean arterial pressure and urinary sodium excretion were measured on the last three days of each week. The degree of interaction between the antihypertensive drugs and sodium restriction was statistically compared. The hypotensive effect of nicardipine and propranolol did not differ with the change in sodium intake, whereas that of captopril was greater under sodium restriction than under the regular sodium diet. Urinary sodium excretion was plotted on the ordinate as a function of arterial pressure before and after administration of the antihypertensive drugs. The pressure-natriuresis curve was shifted left, without a change in the slope, by nicardipine and propranolol and also left, but with a decrease in the slope, by captopril. The hypotensive effect of nicardipine and propranolol, being independent of the amount of sodium intake, was based on the leftward shift of the pressure-natriuresis curve that was probably due to the decrease in renal vascular resistance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "152": "We compared the antihypertensive efficacy of atenolol (100 mg/d), canrenoate potassium (200 mg/d), and captopril (75 mg/d) in 30 essential hypertensives. The three drugs were administered in a randomized change-over sequence for four-months each. The main variables associated with blood pressure regulation were measured in the basal condition and at the end of each treatment period. The erythrocyte Na transport systems were measured only in the basal condition and at the end of the first treatment period. The average blood pressure reduction was similar for each drug. Mean blood pressure levels after captopril correlated positively with those after atenolol in the individual patients (P less than 0.0001); mean blood pressure levels after canrenoate potassium, on the contrary, did not correlate with those after the other two drugs. Captopril and canrenoate potassium treatment reduced intraerythrocyte Na content (P less than 0.02), canrenoate potassium increased Na-K pump (P0.05), atenolol did not change any erythrocyte membrane Na transport parameters. The ouabain-resistant Na transport systems were not modified by any drug. The patients were divided in three groups according to their antihypertensive response: nonresponders (six patients), canrenoate potassium responders (nine patients) and captopril-atenolol responders (15 patients, equally responsive to both drugs). Nonresponders had the lowest basal Na pump (P less than 0.02). Canrenoate potassium responders had higher basal Na-K cotransport than captopril-atenolol responders (P less than 0.02). Atenolol-captopril responders had the highest basal plasma renin activity (PRA, P less than 0.02). The blood pressure reduction after atenolol correlated with the induced fall in PRA (P less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "153": "Comparative effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) captopril and calcium entry blocker nifedipine on the split renal function were studied in six patients with renovascular hypertension (RVH) with unilateral stenosis (38 +/- 5 years). Both captopril and nifedipine showed potent antihypertensive effects; the mean arterial pressure was reduced from 131 +/- 16 to 105 +/- 8 mm Hg (P less than 0.001) by captopril, and from 128 +/- 15 to 109 +/- 11 mm Hg (P less than 0.001) by nifedipine. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in the stenotic kidney was 24 +/- 6 mL/min, which decreased to 11 +/- 2 mL/min (P less than 0.01) during captopril administration, and only slightly decreased (18.8 +/- 5 mL/min) during nifedipine administration. The effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) increased in the nonstenotic kidneys in response to both drugs. These results show that angiotensin II rather than renal perfusion pressure may be important for maintaining GFR in the stenotic kidney, and further suggest that nifedipine may be used relatively safely in treating patients with RVH, although caution should be exercised in terms of their ability to preserve the renal function in individual kidneys.", 
    "154": "The role of the renin-angiotensin system as a mediator of water intake, induced by hypovolemia after polyethylene glycol (PEG) injection, was investigated. Blockade of angiotensin I converting enzyme and of angiotensin receptors was used as a pharmacological tool. A significant reduction of water intake was observed when angiotensin I converting enzyme was inhibited by captopril and enalapril. In PEG-treated rats with blockade of angiotensin I converting enzyme, hypertonic saline injection continued to elicit substantial drinking. Normalization of low blood pressure by vasopressin infusions in PEG and captopril treated rats did not interfere with the antidipsogenic effectiveness of converting enzyme blockade. The angiotensin II receptor antagonist, saralasin, also reduced PEG-induced drinking although less effectively than converting enzyme inhibitors. We conclude that water intake due to isotonic depletion of the extracellular fluid compartment may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "155": "Female Long Evans and Brattleboro rats were studied while water-replete and after water deprivation sufficient to cause hypovolaemia of similar degree in the two strains. A comparison was made of the blood chemistry and cardiovascular status in the two conditions, and the ability of the renin-angiotensin system, sympathoadrenal activity and (in Long Evans rats) vasopressin to influence blood pressure were assessed by pharmacological blockade of these systems. Under water-replete conditions there were significant differences between plasma variables in the two strains (Long Evans: vol., 3.67 +/- 0.07 ml/100 g b. wt., sodium, 142 +/- 0.3 mmol/l; osmolality, 290 +/- 1 mosmol/kg; Brattleboro: vol., 3.89 +/- 0.07 ml/100 g b. wt.; sodium 148 +/- 0.4 mmol/l; osmolality 304 +/- 2 mosmol/kg). Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system (with captopril) had a slightly greater hypotensive effect in Brattleboro than in Long Evans rats. In both strains the hypotensive effects of captopril were enhanced markedly in the presence of pentolinium, and, under those conditions there was a vasopressin-dependent recovery of blood pressure in Long Evans rats that was absent in Brattleboro rats. Water deprivation caused a greater proportional reduction in body weight, and increase in plasma sodium and osmolality in Brattleboro than in Long Evans rats, although resting cardiovascular statuses were not markedly different. Despite Brattleboro rats having substantial hypernatraemia (156 +/- 1.0 mmol/l), that should have acted to inhibit renin release, they showed a profound hypotensive response to captopril that was not apparent in Long Evans rats. Thus, the absence of vasopressin in female Brattleboro rats severely affects cardiovascular adaptation to water deprivation. Comparison of the present results with published data obtained from male Long Evans and Brattleboro rats shows marked sex differences in the response to the same water deprivation protocol, and indicates that data obtained from males and females should not be cumulated.", 
    "156": "In 16 male patients with heart failure (NYHA II-III), the influence of a single dose of 25 mg captopril on the carotid sinus baroreceptor reflex was examined. Blood pressure fell significantly by 11 +/- 1.7 mm Hg (P less than 0.001), whereas heart rate remained unchanged (85 +/- 3 vs. 83 +/- 3 beats min-1). Carotid sinus baroreceptors were stimulated by means of an airtight neck chamber. Two indices of baroreflex sensitivity were calculated. (1) The sensitivity to reflex heart rate slowing was increased by captopril from -2.9 +/- 0.7 to -5.0 +/- 1.3 ms mmHg-1 (P less than 0.02). The higher the initial sensitivity the more pronounced was the change after captopril with an increase of sensitivity by 46% (y = 1.46x -0.17, P less than 0.01). This increase in sensitivity cannot be explained by haemodynamic changes induced by captopril. (2) In eight patients the sensitivity of the baroreflex to increased transmural pressure gradients of the carotid sinus was evaluated by registration of the blood pressure response to neck suction; this demonstrated an unchanged responsiveness following captopril administration. From these data it can be concluded that captopril selectively augments a reflex bradycardia which is mediated by an increase in vagal efferent tone. The change in the reflex response depends on the initial reflex sensitivity and cannot be explained by haemodynamic changes caused by captopril.", 
    "157": "Repeated blood pressure recordings by non-invasive devices are of better predictive value than single measurements in the evaluation of antihypertensive treatment. Such a method has been used to establish the dose-effect relationship of perindopril. After a two-week placebo run-in period, 40 patients with essential hypertension (age 56.6 +/- 1.5 years, 31 males, nine females) were treated with placebo or 2, 4 or 8 mg of perindopril once daily for one month following a randomized double-blind design. They were included if at least 75% of diastolic blood pressure recordings, made over an 8 h diurnal period using an automatic blood pressure recorder, were greater than 95 mmHg on placebo. Values (mean +/- SEM) before and after treatment were assessed using analysis of variance. These data showed a significantly greater reduction of blood pressure with 4 mg and 8 mg daily doses compared to placebo and the 2 mg daily dose. Such results were not obtained with blood pressure levels recorded by a mercury sphygmomanometer, confirming the value of an automatic blood pressure recorder as a tool in therapeutic trials.", 
    "158": "The vascular permeability-increasing response to T-kinin in rat and guinea pig skin was investigated. The vascular permeability was measured with 125I-labeled bovine serum albumin [( 125I]BSA) as a tracer. Plasma exudation rapidly occurred 0-15 min after the intradermal injection of T-kinin. T-kinin in doses of 0.3, 1, and 3 nM/spot significantly increased the vascular permeability in a dose-dependent manner. The vascular response of T-kinin is similar to that of bradykinin. On the other hand, T-kinin analogs, D-Ile-Ser-bradykinin and Ile-D-Ser-bradykinin only weakly enhanced the vascular permeability. Prostaglandin E1, forskolin, and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, SQ-14225, potentiated the T-kinin-induced plasma exudation. Cyproheptadine and indomethacin did not affect the T-kinin-induced response. The results suggest that T-kinin will play an important role in increasing vascular permeability associated with inflammation.", 
    "159": "It was previously shown that autoregressive modeling can be used for feedback analysis in the body. We used this method to investigate the dynamic changes in and around the renin-angiotensin system in vivo induced by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. Long-term studies were performed on rabbits, which were given a daily injection of one of the following ACE inhibitors: captopril, foroxymithine, or histargin. For comparison, other rabbits received injections of saline or the renin inhibitor pepstatin. Autoregressive coefficients were computed from the raw data thus observed and were used to simulate the impulse-response function proper to each animal. The response of each animal estimated in this way exposed the effects of ACE inhibitors in vivo which were obscured by the feedback regulation of the renin-angiotensin system. Also, it was suggested that histargin has a peculiar action, blocking the negative feedback that would be elicited by the usual ACE inhibition. Feedback analysis seems to be essential to elucidate the in vivo effects of enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "160": "The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors constitute a major breakthrough in the medical management of congestive heart failure. The incidence of side effects with these agents is surprisingly low when they are used in the appropriate dosage. They produce sustained beneficial hemodynamic and symptomatic improvement in most patients with congestive heart failure and may produce greater symptomatic benefit than digoxin when given as second-line therapy to patients with heart failure on diuretics. Their neurohumoral effects generally are advantageous, resulting in normalization of sodium and potassium balance and a reduction in ventricular arrhythmias. The ACE inhibitors may improve survival in patients with congestive heart failure, and recent data suggest that they may prevent or delay the development of left ventricular dilatation and overt heart failure in patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction.", 
    "161": "As a result of the understanding of the factors governing myocardial performance achieved in the physiology laboratory, vasodilator therapy was introduced for patients with refractory heart failure nearly two decades ago. Ten years later, investigations began with the first orally active angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), captopril, in patients with severe congestive heart failure (CHF). Subsequent studies have definitively demonstrated that ACEIs produce symptomatic and exercise tolerance improvement in patients with moderate and severe CHF. This favorable experience led to the investigation of captopril in patients with milder symptoms in whom the goals of treatment must be defined more rigorously. An optimal agent for this patient group would not only reduce symptoms, but improve prognosis and have demonstrable advantages over existing treatments. A growing body of investigational data and clinical experience indicates that the ACEIs achieve these goals. As a result, they are being used with increasing frequency in patients with milder grades of heart failure.", 
    "162": "Hypertension in patients with diabetes mellitus increases the risk of both macrovascular and microvascular complications. Such microvascular complications as diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy are accelerated in the presence of arterial hypertension. Evidence suggests that the complications of diabetes mellitus begin early in the course of the disorder as manifested by microalbuminuria and increased vascular reactivity. These findings are accompanied by changes in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system including reductions in plasma renin activity. These changes could be secondary to volume expansion that may be a direct consequence of elevated blood glucose, suggesting that the metabolic disorder in diabetes contributes to the etiology of hypertension in these patients. Adequate treatment of hypertension is crucial to the prevention of complications; however, many antihypertensive agents have limited usefulness in diabetes mainly because of their unfavorable side effects. Diuretics lower blood pressure in hypertensive diabetics, but their metabolic effects are especially undesirable in this population. beta-Blockers alter glucose and lipid metabolism in diabetic patients and reduce regional blood flow. Central acting agents and alpha-blockers are often associated with orthostatic hypotension, sexual dysfunction, and central nervous system side effects. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) such as captopril effectively lower blood pressure in diabetic patients and have few unwanted effects. They may improve metabolic control and have favorable effects on glucose metabolism. The ACEIs also produce improved regional hemodynamics which may lead to the improvement in or prevention of the progression of diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "163": "Systemic hypertension is both the cause and the consequence of renal disease. Experimental studies suggest that the adverse effects of systemic hypertension on the progression of renal disease may depend upon the intraglomerular hemodynamic consequences. Systemic hypertension accompanied by afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction is associated with normal glomerular capillary pressure and relative protection against morphologic injury. In contrast, systemic hypertension with afferent arteriolar vasodilatation leads to glomerular hypertension and is associated with structural injury. Glomerular hypertension may be present even in the setting of normal systemic pressure, as in experimental diabetes. Therapeutic interventions that attenuate glomerular capillary hypertension slow the development of glomerular injury. Dietary protein restriction, which normalizes glomerular capillary filtration, perfusion, and pressure without lowering blood pressure, retards the development of glomerular sclerosis. Alternatively, selective reduction of glomerular capillary pressure with converting-enzyme inhibitor therapy is also protective against progressive renal injury. In contrast, antihypertensive therapy, which controls systemic hypertension but does not reduce glomerular capillary pressure, fails to protect remnant kidney rats from glomerular injury. These studies suggest that control of glomerular hypertension may be of special benefit to the patient with progressive renal disease.", 
    "164": "Mild hypertension accounts for approximately 60% of the mortality associated with high blood pressure. In addition to hypertension, other major cardiovascular risk factors include left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), dyslipoproteinemia, and glucose intolerance. Thus, the effects of agents used to treat hypertension on these risk factors are of considerable importance. Large therapeutic intervention trials have shown that while adequate treatment of mild hypertension significantly and consistently reduces all-cause mortality as well as the risk of stroke and congestive heart failure, an anticipated reduction in coronary heart disease (CHD) has not been demonstrated. It is possible adverse metabolic side effects (hypercholesterolemia, hyperglycemia, hypokalemia) of widely used agents, such as diuretics and beta-blockers may be partially offsetting the beneficial effects of blood pressure reduction, with the net result being a failure of these agents to reduce the risk of CHD. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and calcium channel blockers do not produce these adverse metabolic derangements. The use of antihypertensive agents that have favorable or neutral metabolic effects should further reduce the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality attributable to high blood pressure, including CHD.", 
    "165": "The response to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) can be of considerable help in the diagnosis of human renovascular hypertension (RVH) in three settings. First, a particularly dramatic antihypertensive response or a decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), as indexed by a rise in serum creatinine or blood urea nitrogen concentrations, are useful clues to the presence of renovascular hypertension. Second, an exaggerated rise in plasma renin activity (PRA) after short-term captopril administration is a very promising screening test for this condition. Third, ACEI-induced changes in single-kidney hemodynamics (assessed by renography) may be helpful in confirming the diagnosis and offers the prospect of localizing the ischemic kidney.", 
    "166": "The traditional concept of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is a circulation-borne endocrine system, the components of which are secreted by various organs. The product of this biochemical cascade, angiotensin II, acts on specific receptors on multiple target organs. Activation of this circulating system has been shown to result in vasoconstriction and hypertension. In addition to this endocrine system, evidence is emerging that the renin-angiotensin system also exists at multiple local tissue sites. Recent data demonstrating that inhibitors of the RAS are capable of lowering blood pressure in the presence of suppressed as well as elevated plasma renin activity (PRA) have given rise to the hypothesis that these inhibitors exert a large part of their effect on angiotensin that is synthesized by and contained in local tissues. The concept implies that local angiotensin concentrations may exceed those of plasma levels and may play an important role in the tonic control of vascular resistance, cardiac and adrenal functions, and intrarenal events. The hypothesis could explain the broad spectrum of activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in hypertensives as well as their continuing antihypertensive activity after plasma ACE levels have been restored.", 
    "167": "This study examined whether patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and normal renal function have an altered response to an amino acid infusion when they are pretreated with a converting-enzyme inhibitor. Three groups of adults received amino acid infusions for 20 min on two occasions separated by a 240-min interval. Groups 1 (6 normals) and 2 (6 diabetics) ingested captopril (12.5 mg) 120 min before starting the second infusion. Group 3 (4 diabetics) did not receive captopril. Diabetics had normal base-line renal plasma flow, as indicated by para-aminohippuric acid clearance (CPAH), and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). In group 1, the maximum increase in CPAH was significant and similar with both infusions, 23 +/- 5 vs. 15 +/- 3% (SE); maximal changes in GFR were also significant and similar, 20 +/- 5 vs. 20 +/- 6%. In Group 2, the maximal increase in CPAH and GFR with the first infusion was 28 +/- 7 and 23 +/- 6%, respectively. After captopril, the increases in CPAH and GFR were significantly greater than with the first infusion (64 +/- 8%, P less than 0.002, and 67 +/- 9%, P less than 0.002, respectively). In Group 3 diabetics, there was no difference in either CPAH or GFR with the first vs. the second infusion. Thus captopril enhances the renal hemodynamic response to an amino acid load in diabetic patients but not in normal adults.", 
    "168": "The renin-angiotensin system is activated by congestive heart failure associated with a ventricular septal defect (VSD). To determine the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition on the hemodynamics with VSD, the dose response curve of captopril was measured in lambs. Furthermore, the effect of captopril on the distribution of systemic output was determined by the radionuclide-labeled microsphere technique. A total of 12 lambs (less than 1 month old) with VSD were instrumented and a minimum of five animals was tested for each data point. Captopril (0.05-10 mg/kg) caused dose-dependent vascular changes. At a dose of 2 mg/kg, maximal hemodynamic effects were observed. The systemic resistance fell by 28 +/- 9% (mean +/- SD, p less than 0.05, n = 9), whereas pulmonary arteriolar resistance rose by 113 +/- 34% (p less than 0.05). These vascular changes caused a reduction in the ratio of pulmonary to systemic flow from 3.31 +/- 0.59 to 2.19 +/- 0.29 (-34%, p less than 0.05) and a reduction in left-to-right shunt volume by 30% (p less than 0.05). The left atrial pressure fell from 17.3 +/- 3.4 to 10.8 +/- 2.8 mm Hg (-38%, p less than 0.05). Mean aortic pressure was unchanged (71.2 +/- 8.1 versus 67.4 +/- 9.1). Forward flow from the left ventricle increased from 2.17 +/- 0.46 to 2.86 +/- 0.54 liter/min/M2 (p less than 0.05). Microsphere-determined organ blood flow to the heart, kidney, liver, duodenum, and skeletal muscle was preserved after a 5 mg/kg dose of captopril and, in fact, tended to increase, but the changes were not significant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "169": "A case of renovascular hypertension is presented in which the [131I]hippuran renogram was initially normal, but became strikingly abnormal upon administration of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril. The patient presented with fibromuscular dysplasia of the renal arteries, which was shown by hippuran renography to be functionally significant on the right side. She became normotensive after angioplasty of the right renal artery. Hypertension recurred a year later, at which time the renogram was normal without captopril, but showed functionally significant left renal artery stenosis with captopril challenge. Both the conventional agent, [131I]hippuran, and an experimental new 99mTc-labeled hippuran analog, [99mTc]MAG3, were used. Angiography confirmed progression of disease on the left side, which was successfully treated by angioplasty. Functionally significant unilateral renal artery stenosis was thus demonstrated first on the right side and then, 1 yr later, on the left side, using hippuran and [99mTc]MAG3. Anatomic progression of disease was documented by angiography.", 
    "170": "Blood pressure, forearm arterial hemodynamics (with a pulsed Doppler flowmeter), and echocardiographic parameters were studied in 16 patients with sustained essential hypertension before and 3 months after administration of the converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril. In a single-blind study versus placebo, it was shown that perindopril significantly reduced blood pressure (p less than 0.01), whereas there was an increase in brachial blood flow (p less than 0.01) because of a simultaneous increase in blood flow velocity (p less than 0.01) and arterial diameter (p less than 0.01). During a 5-minute period of wrist occlusion, blood flow velocity was reduced to a greater extent with perindopril than with placebo (p less than 0.001), whereas corresponding reductions in arterial diameter were equivalent, indicating that the increase in diameter after perindopril could not be explained simply on the basis of flow-dependent dilatation. During active treatment, brachial artery compliance increased (p less than 0.01) and pulse wave velocity decreased (p less than 0.01), whereas there was no change in the tangential tension of the arterial wall, defined as the product of mean arterial pressure and arterial diameter. Four weeks after treatment was stopped, blood pressure and forearm arterial hemodynamics returned toward baseline values. Cardiac mass was significantly decreased after perindopril (p less than 0.01) and remained decreased 4 weeks after cessation of treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "171": "This review describes the effects of antihypertensive drugs on the performance of aerobic exercise. All available antihypertensive drugs lower blood pressure both at rest and decrease the rate of increase during exercise. However, they differ in their effects on exercise performance. The ideal antihypertensive agent should not have significant depressant effects on the myocardium, should not promote arrhythmias, should preserve the distribution of blood flow to exercising muscle, and should not interfere with substrate utilization. Diuretics, one of the most commonly prescribed class of antihypertensives, have few deleterious effects on exercise performance but have adverse metabolic effects; beta blockers have many adverse effects on exercise performance. Agents which have the least potential for adverse effects on exercise performance and metabolic effects are the converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and alpha blockers, and central alpha agonists. The literature concerning each of these drugs is reviewed and recommendations are made for prescribing for the hypertensive who wishes to engage in vigorous exercise.", 
    "172": "Changes in blood pressure and renal, mesenteric, and hindquarters vascular resistances were measured in conscious Long-Evans and Brattleboro (vasopressin-deficient) rats in response to sequential, continuous administrations of prazosin and idazoxan in the absence or presence of ICI 118551 (beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist) or propranolol. The large transient hypotensions elicited by prazosin and, subsequently, by idazoxan were associated with renal and hindquarters vasodilatations in both strains of rat. In Brattleboro rats, prazosin also elicited mesenteric vasodilatation. Pretreatment with ICI 118551 reduced the initial hypotensive effects and hindquarters vasodilatations elicited by prazosin and idazoxan, but the hemodynamic effects of prazosin were not significantly affected by propranolol. These results are consistent with propranolol antagonizing beta 1-adrenoceptor-mediated effects on the heart and the renin-angiotensin system that act to offset a beta 2-adrenoceptor-mediated vasodilatation, which contributes to the effects elicited by alpha-adrenoceptor antagonism. Hemodynamic responses to captopril and d(CH2)5DAVP (in Long-Evans rats) in the presence of adrenoceptor antagonists were consistent with a major cardiovascular role of the renin-angiotensin system and a less overt role of vasopressin until the latter system was blocked.", 
    "173": "Based on differences in total metabolite accumulation in the presence or absence of selective peptidase inhibitors, rat plasma is found to have its own unique pattern of enkephalin hydrolysis. Approximately 85-90% of the hydrolysis of [leu]enkephalin is attributed to the combined action of aminopeptidase M and angiotensin converting enzyme, whereas \"enkephalinase\" and aminopeptidase MII activity against [leu]enkephalin are not detectable. Similarly, 80-90% of the hydrolysis of D-ala2-[L-leu] enkephalin (DALLE) is due to the combined action of aminopeptidase M and angiotensin converting enzyme, whereas aminopeptidase MII and enkephalinase activity against this substrate also could not be detected. This is in contrast to the high susceptibility to hydrolysis by enkephalinase, and the low susceptibility to aminopeptidase activity, for DALLE in brain tissue. Among other alternatives, it is suggested that enkephalin hydrolysis in plasma may appear to be unique because of differences in enzyme conformation and/or the availability of a substance(s) that competes with, or alters the binding of, [leu] enkephalin, DALLE or the inhibitors to the enzymes.", 
    "174": "1. The pharmacokinetics of single oral doses of 20 mg lisinopril and 0.25 mg digoxin, given alone and together, have been studied in 12 normal young male volunteers. 2. Peak serum conc of lisinopril occurred at 6 to 8 h and were slightly higher during combined treatment. Subsequent elimination proceeded moderately rapidly in both cases, concn declining to approx. 25% of peak values in 24 h. The AUC of lisinopril was similarly slightly higher during combined treatment. 3. After lisinopril alone, urinary elimination of unchanged lisinopril was 13% dose in 72 h, and after combined therapy was 17% dose. 4. Although there were no statistically significant differences in lisinopril pharmacokinetics during single or combined treatment, serum and urinary parameters suggest that bioavailability may be enhanced slightly during combined treatment. 5. Plasma concentrations of digoxin were slightly lower and urinary excretion slightly higher during combined treatment, the mean renal clearance being 20% higher.", 
    "175": "1. Isolated preparations of rat anococcygeus muscle were incubated with [3H]-noradrenaline and the efflux of radioactivity induced by stimulation of intramural sympathetic nerves was used as a measure of release of transmitter noradrenaline. Isometric contractile responses were also measured. 2. Angiotensin I (0.03 microM) and angiotensin II (0.03 microM) produced non-sustained contractile responses and enhanced the stimulation-induced (S-I) effluxes of radioactivity as well as the contractile responses to electrical stimulation. These effects were blocked by the angiotensin II receptor antagonist saralasin (0.03 microM), and the effect of angiotensin I, but not angiotensin II, was blocked by the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (0.1 microm). 3. The findings indicate that there are both pre- and postjunctional receptors for angiotensin II and that angiotensin I is converted to angiotensin II in the anococcygeus muscle preparation. 4. Isoprenaline (0.1 microM) slightly enhanced the S-I efflux of radioactivity, and produced a greater enhancement after neuronal uptake blockade with desipramine (0.03 microm) and alpha-adrenoceptor blockade with phentolamine (1 microM). 5. The facilitatory effect of isoprenaline on S-I efflux of radioactivity was abolished by propranolol (0.3 microM), but was not affected by low concentrations of saralasin (0.03 microM) or captopril (0.1 microM) which abolished the effect of angiotensin I. The findings suggest that isoprenaline acts directly on prejunctional beta-adrenoceptors to enhance S-I noradrenaline release, rather than indirectly by releasing angiotensin II from within the tissue. Higher concentrations of saralasin (0.1 microM) or captopril (5 microM) did block the facilitatory effect of isoprenaline. The significance of this finding is not clear.", 
    "176": "In a previous paper, we showed that during a long-term, moderate restriction in sodium intake, sympathetic nervous system activity was only transiently stimulated, whereas a sustained rise of plasma renin activity occurred. However, the contribution from stimulation of the renin-angiotensin system in the maintenance of blood pressure homeostasis during a low-salt diet is still unclear. To investigate this issue, in eight normal subjects blood pressure, heart rate, plasma catecholamines, renin activity, and aldosterone were measured during normal sodium intake (150 mEq/d), after converting-enzyme inhibition (enalapril 20 mg/d po), and during one month of sodium intake restriction (50 mEq/d) associated with chronic inhibition of converting-enzyme (CEI). During a low-salt diet with CEI, plasma renin activity rose significantly as a result of CEI. In addition, even in the presence of a marked and sustained increase in plasma norepinephrine and in upright heart rate, a decrease in blood pressure was observed in all the measurements performed during the course of the study as compared to the control values. Our findings support the hypothesis that renin-angiotensin system activation plays an important role in the maintenance of blood pressure homeostasis during a low-salt diet. In fact, in the presence of an effective blockade of angiotensin II formation, blood pressure is decreased, despite the concurrent, sustained stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system.", 
    "177": "We postulated that Captopril may be capable of acting as a scavenger of free radicals, and performed in vitro studies using harvested human neutrophils. We studied the effect of Captopril on the reduction of Fe3+ cytochrome c by stimulated PMN's. Captopril acts as a reducing agent in this system, and is capable of reducing Fe3+ cytochrome c by itself. NADPH oxidase was harvested from PMA-stimulated human PMN's. Captopril inhibited the activity of this enzyme as assessed by the disappearance of NADPH determined spectrophotometrically. Since similar inhibition could be demonstrated with the superoxide scavenger superoxide dismutase, further studies were conducted using a DTNB assay of the terminal sulfhydryl group of Captopril, in the presence of a biochemical generator of superoxide (hypoxanthine/xanthine oxidase). We were unable to demonstrate disappearance of the thiol group in this system, suggesting that reaction of the SH group with 02- is unlikely under our conditions. We conclude that Captopril may interfere with human PMN NADPH oxidase in vitro.", 
    "178": "The possibility that enalapril might damage renal function was investigated in 1098 deaths recorded in a prescription-event monitoring study. Case notes for 913 patients were examined. In seventy five there was a rise in the urea or creatinine concentration of 50% or more above pretreatment values. Enalapril appeared to have contributed to a decline in renal function and subsequent death in 10 of these patients. Several characteristics were identified among these patients, including old age, the use of high dose or potassium sparing diuretics, and pre-existing renal disease. Adding a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug was also associated with a deterioration in patients with previously stable renal function. No death was encountered of a patient with uncomplicated hypertension. Enalapril infrequently contributed to a substantial decline in renal function in certain vulnerable patients, especially those receiving other drugs known to be capable of adversely affecting renal function. Awareness of the characteristics of these patients and of their concomitant treatment may serve to reduce the risk.", 
    "179": "To identify and measure the incidence of adverse effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril 13,713 patients were studied for one year by prescription-event monitoring. Precise information about the duration of treatment was available for 12,543 patients. The frequency of many events was calculated, including dizziness (483 patients; 3.9%), persistent dry cough (360; 2.9%), headache (310; 2.5%) hypotension (218; 1.7%), and syncope (155; 1.2%). Less common reactions included angioedema, urticaria, and muscle cramps. Altogether 1098 (8%) patients died and the notes of 913 of them (83%) were obtained for detailed scrutiny. With the exception of a few patients with renal failure who deteriorated during treatment (reported on separately), no death was attributed to enalapril. Enalapril was considered to be effective, even in patients with advanced cardiac failure. These results for enalapril are reassuring and provide further evidence of the value of prescription-event monitoring.", 
    "180": "The influence of kinins and angiotensin II on the regulation of renal cortical and papillary blood flow and sodium and water excretion was examined in rats. Superficial cortical and papillary blood flows were measured using a laser-Doppler flowmeter. Papillary blood flow increased 50% after enalaprilat (60 micrograms/kg) and phosphoramidon (5.5 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) were given along with 0.3 M sodium bicarbonate solution to inhibit degradation of kinins and enhance urinary kallikrein activity. Infusion of a kinin antagonist, D-Arg-Hyp-Thi-D-Phe-bradykinin (5 micrograms/min), returned papillary blood flow to control levels. Urine flow and sodium excretion increased after the administration of the kininase inhibitors and sodium bicarbonate, while glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and outer cortical blood flow were unaltered. The kinin antagonist did not alter sodium and water excretion in rats receiving the kininase inhibitors and bicarbonate. Administration of the kinin antagonist alone lowered papillary blood flow by 20%, without affecting outer cortical blood flow or GFR. Urine flow decreased and urine osmolality increased after the rats received the kinin antagonist, but sodium excretion remained unaltered. To assess the role of angiotensin II in the control of papillary blood flow, kinin receptors were blocked by infusion of an antagonist, and the effects of enalaprilat and saralasin were studied. Papillary blood flow increased after blockade of the angiotensin II system in rats receiving the kinin antagonist. These results indicate that the kallikrein-kinin and renin-angiotensin systems participate in the regulation of papillary blood flow.", 
    "181": "Perindopril is the ester prodrug of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor S-9780. The influence of age on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of S-9780 (1 mg administered intravenously) and perindopril (8 mg administered orally) was examined in a double-blind, crossover, acute study in eight young (29 +/- 3 years) and eight elderly (71 +/- 3 years) healthy subjects. Mild headache and light-headedness were the only adverse effects and were more common in the younger subjects. Blood pressure fall was greater in the elderly even after correction for starting blood pressure. Bioavailability of S-9780 was increased in the elderly (35% +/- 17% compared with 19% +/- 7%; p less than 0.025) mainly because of increased conversion rather than absorption. Renal clearance of S-9780 was lower in the elderly (67 +/- 31 ml/min compared with 110 +/- 39 ml/min; p less than 0.03). Dose reduction of approximately 50% is suggested for elderly patients with further adjustment proportional to any preexisting diminished renal function.", 
    "182": "The effectiveness of 2 angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, intravenous enalaprilat and oral captopril, in stimulating renin secretion was compared in 47 hypertensive patients with suspected renovascular hypertension. Both inhibitors were more effective stimuli to renin secretion than head-up tilting of the patient. In patients with unilateral renovascular hypertension single doses of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors increased the renal venous renin ratio compared to the recumbent ratio. This therapy reduced the number of false negative studies more effectively than head-up tilting and was tolerated better. Contralateral suppression of renin in the unaffected kidney, an important ancillary diagnostic marker of unilateral renovascular hypertension, was preserved. No false positive studies owing to the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors acutely were apparent. Mean arterial pressure decreased by 5 minutes with intravenous enalaprilat and by 20 minutes with oral captopril, and it continued to decrease gradually for at least 2 hours. No significant syncopal symptoms were observed with either inhibitor. Plasma renin activity increased by 5 and 15 minutes with enalaprilat and captopril, respectively. Plasma aldosterone levels decreased by 10 minutes with enalaprilat and by 30 minutes with captopril, and these changes increased in magnitude during the 2 hours of observation. To achieve the maximum diagnostic effectiveness from the renal venous renin ratio, single dose angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors warrant consideration for routine use. Intravenous enalaprilat may be preferable because of certain achievement of an effective blood level.", 
    "183": "The effects of salt restriction and the ACE inhibitor enalapril were compared in a model of chronic myocardial infarction in the rat. Total exchangeable sodium was measured by an isotopic dilution technique to quantitate the effects of the low salt diet and ACE inhibitor on body sodium and extracellular fluid. Rats with infarction developed a marked increase in cardiac weight (4.29 +/- 0.18 mg/g body weight) compared with control rats (3.64 +/- 0.08 mg/g, p less than 0.01). There was hypertrophy of both left and right ventricles. Salt restricted rats with infarction developed identical cardiomegaly (4.30 +/- 0.11 mg/g), although total exchangeable body sodium fell by 10% (p less than 0.001). In contrast, rats with infarction receiving enalapril developed significantly less cardiomegaly (3.97 +/- 0.10 mg/g) while body sodium remained unchanged. Rats with infarction had a significant increase in lung weight which was not changed by salt restriction but which was abolished by enalapril. These results suggest that salt restriction does not prevent the progression of cardiomegaly in chronic left heart failure. In contrast our results confirm the ability of ACE inhibitors to prevent progressive cardiomegaly and left heart failure without affecting long-term changes in sodium balance.", 
    "184": "1. Renin substrate (RS) and certain serine protease inhibitors share structural homology. Previous studies have shown that RS may be an acute-phase protein. 2. This prospective study was carried out to monitor plasma RS and other components of the renin-angiotensin system and acute-phase proteins during infectious peritonitis in patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. 3. RS was measured by both an enzymatic assay and a direct radioimmunoassay. An enzymatic assay measures intact RS only, whereas a direct radioimmunoassay measures both intact RS, capable of releasing angiotensin I and des-(angiotensin I)-RS, the residue of RS after cleavage of angiotensin I. 4. RS determined by direct radioimmunoassay increased (P less than 0.001) during acute inflammation (peritonitis), whereas neither RS measured enzymatically nor plasma renin activity changed significantly. 5. Our observation points to RS being an acute-phase protein in man. 6. Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme was measured by both an enzymatic and an inhibitor-binding assay. Both assays showed decreased levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme during acute inflammation.", 
    "185": "Proteinuria and progressive glomerulosclerosis are commonly associated with nephron loss. We studied the pathogenesis of these lesions by examining the role of changes in specific glomerular capillary wall permeability properties in uninephrectomized rats. The development of altered capillary permselectivity to macromolecules and loss of glomerular basement membrane anionic charge were measured by the dextran fractional clearance and ferritin tracer probe methods, respectively. In addition, the protective effect of dietary protein restriction and an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor (captopril) were studied in eight groups of male Sprague-Dawley rats. Four groups of rats underwent sham-nephrectomy or left nephrectomy and were fed an 8.5% protein diet (sham-nephrectomy and low protein, nephrectomy and low protein) or a 30% protein diet, respectively (sham-nephrectomy and high protein, nephrectomy a high protein). Four other groups of rats underwent sham-nephrectomy or left nephrectomy and were treated with captopril (50 mg/kg/day) while receiving a 8.5% protein diet (sham-nephrectomy, low protein and captopril, nephrectomy, low protein and captopril) or a 30% protein diet, respectively (sham-nephrectomy, high protein and captopril, nephrectomy, high protein and captopril). Rats were nephrectomized at 21 days of age and were functionally tested and sacrificed at 7 months of age. The nephrectomy and high protein rats had significantly greater proteinuria and higher fractional clearance of neutral dextrans in the 30 to 42 A range compared with that of sham-nephrectomy and high protein, nephrectomy and low protein, and nephrectomy, high protein and captopril rats. The nephrectomy and high protein rats also had a significantly lower labeling of the glomerular basement membrane with cationic ferritin tracer molecules compared with the nephrectomy and low protein and nephrectomy, high protein and captopril rats. Of the eight treatment groups, the nephrectomy and high protein rats had the most severe glomerular lesions. In general, nephrectomized rats fed low dietary protein and nephrectomized rats treated with captopril had significantly less proteinuria, glomerular lesions, and milder changes in the glomerular capillary wall porosity and glomerular basement membrane anionic charge.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "186": "Incubation of cultured bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells with 200 microM of 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) for 24 hr produced a five- to tenfold increase in cellular angiotensin converting enzyme activity (ACE) above that of untreated control cells. A lesser increase was observed in medium ACE. Other methylxanthines produced a similar, but less marked, effect. The elevation of ACE seemed to require de novo protein synthesis since it was reduced by 0.1 microgram/ml cycloheximide. Elevation of cellular cAMP was detected at 30 min after introduction of IBMX, then rapidly returned to control levels at 1 hour, while elevation in cellular ACE at 24 hr required contact with IBMX for at least 2 hr. Hence, the transient elevation in cAMP is unlikely to be the cause of the elevation of ACE. Phorbol ester and synthetic diacyl glycerol OAG, activators of protein kinase C, did not elevate ACE. Indomethacin, at a concentration known to inhibit cyclooxygenase activity, had no effect on the elevation of ACE. The elevation of ACE by IBMX was not affected by the calcium channel blocker verapamil or the calcium chelator EGTA. In contrast, the effect of IBMX was totally abolished by the calmodulin inhibitors trifluoperazine and calmidazolium. The data show that IBMX elevates endothelial cell ACE and suggest that the elevation is mediated by a calcium-calmodulin complex. The studies demonstrate a novel effect of methylxanthines on endothelial cells in culture.", 
    "187": "The safety and tolerability of lisinopril have been assessed in 1,734 hypertensive patients treated with the agent in a number of clinical trials. Here we compare the clinical and laboratory adverse experiences in younger (under 55 years old) and older (at least 55 years old) patients treated with lisinopril monotherapy. The incidence of adverse experiences in these older patients was similar to that in the younger patients. A comparison also was made of clinical adverse experience data for older hypertensive patients treated either with lisinopril monotherapy or with various control agents (atenolol, metoprolol, and hydrochlorothiazide) in double-blind controlled studies. In these studies, the clinical adverse experience incidences and discontinuation percentages seen in the older patients treated with lisinopril were comparable to the data from the patients treated with the control agents. Thus, lisinopril is generally well-tolerated in older hypertensive patients, and should be considered a therapeutic option in the management of these patients.", 
    "188": "This article reports the results of a multicenter international study of the use of lisinopril in patients with congestive heart failure also receiving digoxin, diuretics, or both. Two thirds of the 130 subjects enrolled in the study received lisinopril and one third received placebo. Lisinopril treatment led to a significant improvement in both bicycle and treadmill exercise tolerance, New York Heart Association classification status, cardiac function assessed noninvasively, and symptomatology. There was no age differentiation; the same improvement was achieved in the 35 patients over 65 years old as in the younger patients. There was a mild decrease in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in patients receiving lisinopril, peaking at seven hours. These changes, however, were not significantly different from those seen with placebo. Apart from one patient in whom hypotension developed followed by reversible renal failure, there were no serious adverse effects, and the incidence of sudden death and biochemical abnormalities was no different from that seen with placebo. This study confirms that this agent is an effective, safe, well-tolerated agent in the treatment of congestive cardiac failure and is equally applicable to younger and older patients.", 
    "189": "Heart failure is a common cardiovascular disorder that increases in prevalence with age. Older patients may respond differently than younger patients to the various classes of drugs used in the treatment of congestive heart failure (CHF). The responses of older patients (at least 65 years of age) were evaluated as part of a large multicenter trial utilizing angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in the treatment of CHF. A prospectively planned subgroup analysis of older CHF patients' therapeutic response to the long-acting (approximately 24-hour) ACE inhibitor lisinopril was compared with their response to captopril, a short-acting (less than eight-hour) ACE inhibitor. Symptomatic improvement occurred in both the lisinopril and captopril groups. Exercise duration also improved for patients treated with both agents. However, there was a tendency for lisinopril to be more effective than captopril (p = 0.08). Thus, the low level of renin activity often found in the plasma of older patients did not decrease the ability of the ACE inhibitors to improve effort tolerance. Left ventricular ejection fraction increased in patients treated with lisinopril but not in those treated with captopril. The improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction with lisinopril may be indicative of a more favorable prognosis in patients with CHF, since another long-acting ACE inhibitor, enalapril, reduces the rate of mortality associated with CHF. ACE inhibitors were generally well-tolerated by the older patients in the study. Therefore, ACE inhibitors appear to offer a useful therapeutic approach to the management of CHF in the older age group.", 
    "190": "The antihypertensive efficacy and safety of lisinopril were assessed in 60 older patients with a mean age of 75 years (range, 65 to 85 years) in a 12-week open study. Mean ( +/- SEM) blood pressure while sitting was reduced from 190/106 +/- 3.3/1.8 mm Hg at entry to 162/89 +/- 3.2/1.6 mm Hg after 12 weeks of treatment (p less than 0.001). There was no significant alteration in heart rate, and postural hypotension did not occur. Mean glomerular filtration rate at entry was 61.6 +/- 3.4 ml/minute and was unchanged after 12 weeks of therapy at 62.2 +/- 3.0 ml/minute. Fourteen patients continued to receive lisinopril for a period of one year. Blood pressure remained controlled throughout and heart rate remained unchanged. There was a significant reduction in mean arterial pressure from 128.8 +/- 1.9 mm Hg to 105.1 +/- 1.5 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). Biochemical parameters remained unaltered. There was a significant increase in renal blood flow (p less than 0.025) and a corresponding reduction in renovascular resistance (p less than 0.001) following long-term therapy with lisinopril. Thus, lisinopril was generally well-tolerated and highly effective in lowering blood pressure in older hypertensive patients, whereas at the same time renal function was not adversely changed.", 
    "191": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy has been thought to be more effective in hypertensive patients with normal or elevated levels of renin in the plasma. However, several studies have challenged this concept by demonstrating the efficacy of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (captopril and enalapril) in older patients, among whom a low level of renin activity in the plasma is common, and in other patients with low-renin essential hypertension. Lisinopril, a new long-acting angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, also has been shown to be an effective antihypertensive agent in older patients. This report examines data from 97 older and 710 younger hypertensive patients enrolled in four multicenter trials of eight to 12 weeks' duration. In these trials, the dose of lisinopril was titrated until a diastolic pressure of less than 90 mm Hg was reached, or to a maximal dose of 80 mg per day. In general, the antihypertensive effect achieved in older patients with lisinopril was equal to or greater than that achieved in younger patients. The drug was generally well tolerated. Lisinopril can be expected to be used frequently in older patients.", 
    "192": "Lisinopril, a long-acting angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, is excreted unchanged by the kidney. To determine how reduced renal function affects the drug's antihypertensive efficacy and safety, we studied 26 patients with hypertension associated with impaired renal function, having glomerular filtration rates (GFRs) of 60 ml/minute or less. These patients were enrolled in an open trial of 12 weeks' duration. They were given single daily doses of lisinopril, starting with 2.5 mg in patients with a GFR of less than 30 ml/minute, and 5 mg in the other patients. The dose was titrated to a maximum of 40 mg daily according to the blood pressure response. A diuretic was then added if required. Mean sitting and standing blood pressures at four, eight, and 12 weeks of treatment were significantly reduced compared with pretreatment values. The median dose of lisinopril was 10 mg daily (range, 2.5 to 40 mg), and only four patients required the addition of a diuretic. The mean GFR was unchanged during the study (36 +/- 16.4 ml/minute at baseline, 39 +/- 20.8 ml/minute after 12 weeks of treatment). Twenty-five patients completed the study. The one patient withdrew because of nausea and vomiting due to reflux esophagitis, which was probably not drug-related. Another patient had transient angioneurotic edema and continued to receive lisinopril. No clinically significant hematologic or biochemical abnormalities were observed. Sixteen patients continued to receive lisinopril for one year. Blood pressure control and GFR were well maintained throughout. Thus, in a group of patients who are often difficult to treat, lisinopril provided highly effective blood pressure control and was generally well tolerated.", 
    "193": "The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, lisinopril, has an oral bioavailability of 25 percent +/- 4 percent, which is unaffected by food. The accumulation half-life averages 12.6 hours despite a terminal serum half-life of approximately 40 hours. Steady state is attained after two daily doses (every 24 hours) in healthy volunteers. The drug is not metabolized but is eliminated via the kidneys. Lisinopril probably undergoes glomerular filtration, tubular secretion, and tubular reabsorption. There is no pharmacokinetic interaction between lisinopril and furosemide.", 
    "194": "Hypertension is a major health problem for patients over 65 years of age. Control of elevated blood pressure reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality rates among older hypertensive patients. Increased total peripheral vascular resistance is the primary hemodynamic abnormality in these patients. Initially, diuretics were used alone to lower total peripheral vascular resistance, and thus blood pressure, in older patients. The antihypertensive efficacy of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors has been questioned in this age group, in which low-renin hypertension is common. The latter condition might be thought to favor blood pressure control with diuretics and impair the response to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy. However, recent studies with lisinopril, a new long-acting, nonsulfhydryl angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, indicate that reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure in older hypertensive patients receiving either angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy were not significantly different. These data demonstrate that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor monotherapy can effectively lower blood pressure in older hypertensive patients.", 
    "195": "Several effects of the antihypertensive treatment with angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEI)--whether beneficial or detrimental--are best explained at the renal level. In the presence of a renal artery stenosis, the activation of the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system is first directed at maintaining glomerular filtration and intracapillary hydrostatic pressure through post-glomerular vasoconstriction. Long-term elevation of blood pressure is associated with a shift of the renal function curve, possibly linked with an alteration of the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system. Inhibition of the converting enzyme does affect the mechanisms of sodium conservation. In a subset of essential hypertensive subjects, ACEI may correct a subtle primary abnormality in modulation by sodium of renal (and adrenal) response(s) to angiotensin. Finally, the possibility of renal protection in circumstances such as diabetes mellitus, provides an exciting area of investigations for antihypertensive treatment with ACEI.", 
    "196": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors combined with diuretics and, if necessary, with calcium antagonists can be used with good success for the treatment of otherwise resistant hypertension. Calcium antagonists are an alternative for physically active hypertensive patients who complain of muscular fatigue during treatment with beta-receptor-blocking agents. The calcium antagonist nifedipine has made the treatment of hypertensive emergencies much easier than with the use of clonidine and particularly sodium nitroprusside. In order to determine the place of ACE-inhibitors and of calcium antagonists in the treatment of hypertension- particularly in comparison with beta-blockers and diuretics- controlled long-term studies on the prognosis of patients with mild to moderate hypertension and on the incidence of side effects would be required.", 
    "197": "The blockade of the renin-angiotensin system by inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme has become an established principle in the treatment of hypertension. This has stimulated interest in the inhibition of renin, the enzyme which catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step in the formation of angiotensin II. During recent years, considerable progress has been made in the development of renin inhibitors. Several potent and selective compounds have been synthesized and studied in vitro and in vivo. In experimental animals with a stimulated renin-angiotensin system the haemodynamic effects of renin inhibitors have been shown to be identical to those of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. The two classes of agents also have similar antihypertensive effects in various forms of experimental renal hypertension. However, it is not clear whether then efficacy will be comparable in patients with essential hypertension. The main shortcoming of the currently available renin inhibitors is their low bioavailability after oral administration and their short duration of action. The improvement of these pharmacokinetic properties is the main challenge for future research in this area.", 
    "198": "After improvement of technical equipment continuous ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is more and more used in the diagnosis of hypertension. New fully automatic systems permit a reliable registration and evaluation of 24-h blood pressure profiles. Typical circadian rhythmics of blood pressure, independent of a variability with different grades of activity, can be demonstrated in normotensive persons and also in patients with essential hypertension. Patients with secondary forms of hypertension show a nivellation or offset of circadian blood pressure rhythmics. A study was performed to examine the antihypertensive efficacy of the calcium antagonist Nitrendipine, the beta 1-adrenoceptor-selective blocker Metoprolol, the beta-blocker with intrinsic activity Mepindolol and the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor Enalapril in patients with mild to moderate hypertension over a period of 6 month. Continuous ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was performed before and after 6 month of therapy. 98 of 299 included patients broke off therapy, 47 of those because of side effects. Hydrochlorothiazide was given additionally if the antihypertensive effect of monotherapy was not sufficient after a period of 4 weeks. Morning blood pressure controls at the end of the treatment period showed normotensive values in all groups without significant differences between the groups before and at the end of the treatment period. The number of prescriptions of diuretics necessary to achieve normotension differed between the four treatment groups: Nitrendipine (n = 5), Metoprolol (n = 7), Mepindolol (n = 14), Enalapril (n = 20). In contrast to the morning blood pressure values the continuous 24-h blood pressure monitoring demonstrated significant differences between the therapy groups. Metoprolol turned out as most effective in lowering blood pressure and in reducing the number of systolic blood pressure peaks above 180 mmHg, but on the other hand showed the highest incidence of relative hypotension (less than 100 mmHg systolic, less than 80 mmHg diastolic). Mepindolol demonstrated a significant lower efficacy. In the Nitrendipin group least of all prescriptions of diuretics were necessary and the lowest number of hypotensive systolic blood pressure values occurred. Enalapril showed the most significant reduction of diastolic values above 100 mmHg and the lowest number of diastolic values below 80 mmHg, but the highest number of prescription of diuretics was necessary in the Enalapril group. In none of the four therapy groups a neutralisation of circadian blood pressure rhythmics was demonstrable.", 
    "199": "The force that shaped the evolution of the kidney, anatomically and functionally, has been defense of extracellular fluid volume. Similarly, the role of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in normal physiology involves volume homeostasis rather than blood pressure control. When a volume deficit occurs, e.g., by restriction of sodium intake or through hemorrhage, a substantial part of the renal vasoconstriction that occurs is due to angiotensin II. In this context, the renal response to congestive heart failure resembles the response to a volume deficit, with angiotensin-mediated renal vasoconstriction contributing to the decrease in blood flow, glomerular filtration rate and to sodium retention. Thus, converting-enzyme inhibition improves renal perfusion and function, including sodium, potassium, magnesium and water handling, as a major part of its therapeutic contribution in congestive heart failure.", 
    "200": "Blood flow to skeletal muscle during exercise is limited in patients with chronic congestive heart failure compared with normal persons. This may, in part, be attributed to the inability of the vessels to dilate adequately. In addition, an abnormal skeletal muscle metabolism with oxidative capacity can be demonstrated in patients with chronic congestive heart failure. The latter may partially explain why vasodilators and inotropes that improve central hemodynamics, global leg perfusion or skeletal muscle blood flow during exercise do not increase oxygen uptake by working muscle after acute drug administration. Furthermore, increases in blood flow to skeletal muscle may be redistributed to inactive or less oxygen-dependent muscle fibers. Although acute angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition usually neither exerts substantial improvement in exercise hemodynamics nor interferes with leg perfusion during exercise, skeletal muscle blood flow and oxygen uptake gradually increases with long-term angiotensin-converting enzyme therapy, leading to improved systemic oxygen consumption and exercise tolerance. Several factors, such as reduction in plasma and vascular angiotensin II and sympathetic nervous activity, increased prostaglandin levels and renal function may contribute to this beneficial long-term effect.", 
    "201": "In patients with chronic congestive heart failure (CHF), skeletal muscle blood flow can be measured directly by the continuous thermodilution technique and by the xenon133 clearance method. The continuous thermodilution technique requires retrograde catheterization of the femoral vein and, thus, cannot be repeated conveniently in patients during evaluation of pharmacologic interventions. The xenon133 clearance, which requires only an intramuscular injection, allows repeated determination of skeletal muscle blood flow. In patients with severe CHF, a fixed capacity of the skeletal muscle vasculature to dilate appears to limit maximal exercise performance. Moreover, the changes in peak skeletal muscle blood flow noted during long-term administration of captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, appears to correlate with the changes in aerobic capacity. In patients with CHF, resting supine deep femoral vein oxygen content can be used as an indirect measurement of resting skeletal muscle blood flow. The absence of a steady state complicates the determination of peak skeletal muscle blood flow reached during graded bicycle or treadmill exercise in patients with chronic CHF. Indirect assessments of skeletal muscle blood flow and metabolism during exercise performed at submaximal work loads are currently developed in patients with chronic CHF.", 
    "202": "Pressure or volume overload of the myocardium increases the wall stress, particularly of the subendocardium, and leads to hypertrophy. Even though cardiac hypertrophy is viewed as a beneficial compensatory process that normalizes wall stress, the increased muscle mass carries with it the need of increased blood supply. Overall flow per unit mass is similar at rest in hypertrophic and normal hearts but a reduction of flow to the subendocardium and an increase in minimal coronary vascular resistance have been described. Thus, the potential exists for a vasodilator-induced steal mechanism shunting blood away from potentially ischemic areas. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors reduced myocardial oxygen consumption and coronary blood flow in parallel manner in some studies, indicating preserved coronary autoregulation, but there is also some evidence of a coronary vasodilator effect. Calcium antagonists reduce coronary vascular resistance and improve the myocardial demand-supply ratio, but the clinical usefulness of the newer compounds with supposedly little or no negative inotropic effects remains to be established. Hydralazine improved the myocardial oxygen demand-supply ratio in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, but metabolic function may deteriorate more often after hydralazine than after angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with coronary heart disease. Similar observations have been made using alpha-adrenergic blockers. Although progress has been made in the understanding of the coronary circulation and the influence of vasodilators in congestive heart failure, many questions await clarification using refined or new methodology.", 
    "203": "Regional blood flow and the distribution of cardiac output is an important aspect of the pathophysiology and pharmacology of human congestive heart failure. This study presents the cumulative experience and data from our laboratories with specific reference to (1) the regional blood flow responses, some rather unique, to various vasodilators and inotropes in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF), and (2) the pharmacophysiologic conclusions and concepts that have evolved from these data. Certain drugs and drug groups evoke rather consistent changes in the blood flow of certain organ systems in CHF. Renal blood flow is augmented by hydralazine, an effect that persists with chronic administration. The converting enzyme inhibitors, captopril and enalapril, increase renal blood flow; this implies that the renin-angiotensin II-aldosterone axis plays a major role in modifying renal blood flow and regional blood flow distribution in human CHF. Nitrates either reduce or do not change renal blood flow. Augmentation of hepatic-splanchnic blood flow occurs after first-dose alpha 1-adrenoceptor blockade suggesting that alpha-adrenergic agonism plays an important role in modifying hepatic-splanchnic flow and the regional distribution of cardiac output in CHF. A number of drugs and drug groups increase limb blood flow (e.g., dobutamine, dopexamine, intravenous nitrates, nitroprusside, hydralazine and nifedipine). With respect to regional blood flow and the distribution of cardiac output in CHF, major differences have been shown to exist between drug groups, between drugs within a group and between different doses of a drug. Certain agents can cause a redistribution of systemic flow without changing cardiac output.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "204": "The degree of activation of neurohormonal mechanisms appears to depend on the severity and acuteness of cardiac impairment as well as the status of the extracellular fluid volume. Vasoconstrictive antinatriuretic mechanisms are markedly activated in severe decompensated cardiac failure. These are accompanied by parallel increases in endogenous vasodilatory natriuretic activities that modulate the powerful vasoconstrictive mechanisms. During chronic compensation, many of these neuroendocrine mechanisms returned to the baseline normal level. In addition to endocrine and neurogenic mechanisms, local autocrine-paracrine systems in the blood vessel wall may also contribute to the regulation of vascular tone. The role of these systems in congestive heart failure has not been systematically studied. It is possible that they may contribute to the long-term regulation of vascular tone and therefore may play an increasing role in the pathogenesis of ventricular remodeling, dilatation and progressive congestive heart failure.", 
    "205": "Renal autoregulation of blood flow (RBF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were examined in 10 conscious foxhounds under a normal sodium diet before and after a continuous intrarenal converting-enzyme inhibition (CEI) or during the application of the angiotensin II antagonist saralasin. In order to prevent alpha-adrenergic interference, phenoxybenzamine was infused into the renal artery. In contrast to studies performed in salt depleted dogs there was no impairment of RBF or GFR autoregulation after CEI or saralasin. Renal blood flow was autoregulated at a level of 3.81 +/- 0.18 ml min-1 g-1 in the control group, 3.98 +/- 0.16 ml min-1 g-1 after CEI and 3.97 +/- 0.41 ml min-1 g-1 after saralasin. The lowest point of autoregulation was very much the same between the individual groups (control: 65.0 +/- 1.4 mmHg; CEI: 66.5 +/- 4.6 mmHg; saralasin: 67.4 +/- 3.2 mm Hg). GFR acted in a similar manner (autoregulation level control: 0.50 +/- 0.03 ml min-1 g-1; CEI: 0.52 +/- 0.05 ml min-1 g-1; saralasin. 0.50 +/- 0.04 ml min-1 g-1). The lowest pressure of GFR autoregulation differed slightly more (control: 81.5 +/- 2.2 mmHg; CEI: 93.2 +/- 4.2 mmHg; saralasin: 85.9 +/- 2.1 mmHg). The results suggest that the renal autoregulation of GFR and RBF is independent of the renin-angiotensin system in conscious dogs during a normal sodium diet.", 
    "206": "CGS 16617, a direct-acting angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, was administered as a single dose of 20 mg in aqueous solution to 12 healthy male volunteers on two occasions in a randomized, cross-over design study. On one occasion, the dose was administered after an overnight fast; on the other occasion, it was administered after subjects ate a standard breakfast. Administration of CGS 16617 after food was associated with statistically significant decreases in peak plasma concentrations (58%) and areas under the plasma concentration-time curves (23%) compared with drug administration in the fasted state. Also, the time to peak plasma concentration was increased (57%) in a statistically significant manner when CGS 16617 was administered after food. Thus, the ingestion of food decreased both the rate and extent of absorption of this drug, but the mechanism of the interaction is unknown at present.", 
    "207": "There are few data available about the hemodynamic effects of isometric handgrip in severe congestive heart failure and its role in the evaluation of vasodilatory therapy. Therefore, we studied 20 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy at rest, during isometric handgrip, and during supine bicycle exercise before and after a single 25-mg dose of captopril. During handgrip, heart rate (p less than 0.001); systemic vascular resistance (p less than 0.01); systolic, mean, and diastolic pulmonary artery pressure (p less than 0.01) increased significantly; stroke volume index fell (p less than 0.05); whereas mean arterial pressure showed only a small increase, and cardiac index did not change. In contrast, mean arterial pressure and cardiac index increased during dynamic exercise (p less than 0.001), and peripheral resistance decreased (p less than 001). During both handgrip and bicycle exercise, captopril induced a decrease of arterial pressure (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.001; respectively), peripheral resistance (p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.01; respectively), and systolic (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.001, respectively) mean (p less than 0.001), and diastolic pulmonary artery pressure (p less than 0.001).

    "208": "The effect of captopril on energy-rich phosphates and pH during normothermic ischemic arrest, hypothermic cardioplegic arrest and subsequent reperfusion was investigated in the isolated rat heart using 31P-nuclear magnetic resonance. The hearts remained in the probe during all perfusion procedures and captopril (80 ml.l-1) treatment was started directly after cannulation. After normothermic ischemic arrest (15 min), the ATP content of captopril-treated hearts was not significantly different from that of untreated hearts (53 +/- 9% and 52 +/- 8%, respectively). Accumulation of inorganic phosphate at the end of ischemia was significantly less in treated hearts, suggesting a higher end-ischemic nucleotide content in treated hearts. Hypothermic cardioplegic arrest (St. Thomas' Hospital solution, 4 degrees C) lasted for 3 h at 10 degrees C. Adenosine triphosphate in untreated hearts was significantly lower at the end of ischemia; 36 +/- 6% compared to 53 +/- 9% for untreated hearts. Adenosine triphosphate in untreated hearts recovered to 76 +/- 9% after normothermic ischemia and to 72 +/- 7% after hypothermic ischemia at the end of 30 min reperfusion. Captopril significantly improved adenosine triphosphate recovery in both treated groups; 89 +/- 4% after normothermic and 83 +/- 4% hypothermic ischemia. We conclude that captopril has a beneficial effect on recovery of adenosine triphosphate both after normothermic and after hypothermic ischemia.",

    "210": "The regional haemodynamic responses to equipressor doses of neuropeptide Y (NPY), vasopressin (AVP) and angiotensin II (AII) were assessed in conscious Long Evans and Brattleboro rats, chronically instrumented with miniaturized, pulsed Doppler probes. NPY caused particularly potent renal vasoconstrictions in intact rats of both strains. However, there were differential changes in regional vascular sensitivity of NPY following administration of pentolinium and captopril, indicating that 'buffer' mechanisms were an important determinant of responses to NPY. A marked mesenteric and low renal sensitivity to AVP was seen in both strains in all conditions. AVP was the most potent of the 3 pressor agents, and no evidence was found for it interacting uniquely with buffer mechanisms. The pressor action of AII was offset by a tendency towards hindquarters vasodilatation that was converted to a marked vasoconstriction when pentolinium and captopril were administered. It is feasible that, in the intact rat, AII stimulated adrenal medullary adrenal release which caused beta-adrenoceptor-mediated vasodilatation that acted to offset the direct vasoconstrictor effects of AII.", 
    "211": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is equated with chronic bronchitis and emphysema as one disease entity. In COPD airflow limitation is relatively persistent--unlike asthma. Tests for \"small-airways disease\" form no part of routine practice, for their accuracy in detecting pathological change is debatable. The proteolytic theory of the pathogenesis of emphysema highlights the role of neutrophil elastase, antielastases, oxidants, antioxidants, and thus of potential new treatments. Clinical features of COPD include breathlessness, cough, and sputum, with airflow obstruction and lung hyperinflation. The differential diagnosis includes bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis, and pulmonary hypertension, but pulmonary fibrosis, etc., is distinguished by radiological infiltrates. Plain chest radiography cannot reliably diagnose emphysema in life, but a new method measuring lung density from the computed tomographic (CT) scan allows location, quantitation, and diagnosis of emphysema (defined by enlargement of distal air spaces) in humans in life. \"Pink puffers\" with breathlessness, hyperinflation, mild hypoxemia, and a low PCO2 are contrasted with \"blue bloaters\" with hypoxemia, secondary polycythemia, CO2 retention, and pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale. Antismoking measures are a major aim in management. A bronchodilator regimen combining a slow-release oral theophylline with an inhaled beta 2-agonist, ipratropium, and high-dose inhaled steroids is proposed because even modest improvement in obstruction can help these patients. In acute exacerbations with purulent sputum, antimicrobials against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Hemophilus influenzae are used with controlled oxygen therapy aiming to keep the arterial PO2 over 50 mm Hg without the pH falling below 7.25. Influenza prophylaxis is recommended, but pneumococcal vaccination remains debatable. Chronic under-nutrition in \"emphysema\" implies controlled trials of feeding regimens--but these remain to be assessed. Long-term oxygen therapy is the only treatment known to prolong life in blue bloaters, and oxygen concentrators and transtracheal oxygen delivery are discussed. Pulmonary vasodilators (e.g., beta 2-agonists, hydralazine, nifedipine, angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors, etc.) have not yet been proved to provide long-term reduction in pulmonary arterial pressure. Blue bloaters have severe nocturnal hypoxemia in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep that is corrected by oxygen or the investigational drug almitrine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "212": "Studies were performed in 12 conscious sheep of both sexes to determine if a brain dopaminergic pathway is involved in modulating the central actions of angiotensin II (Ang II) in regulating body temperature and plasma renin activity (PRA). Previous data showed that intracerebroventricular (ICV) infusion of Ang II significantly decreased PRA and body temperature. In contrast, converting enzyme inhibitor SQ 20881 (SQ) or dopamine (DA) significantly increased PRA and body temperature of sheep. In the present study, ICV infusion of the DA antagonist metoclopramide (MCP) (20 micrograms/min) significantly decreased PRA to 68 +/- 5% of the basal level. When sheep were pretreated with ICV MCP (20 micrograms/min) for 2 hr and then infused ICV with MCP (20 micrograms/min) plus DA (20 micrograms/min), Ang II (25 ng/min), or SQ (1 microgram/min), the PRA and temperature responses to DA, Ang II, or SQ were all abolished or attenuated significantly. The converse did not hold. Sheep pretreated with SQ (1 microgram/min) still showed a significant increase in body temperature (0.43 +/- 0.05 degree C) when infused with DA (20 micrograms/min). These results support the hypothesis that a central DA pathway is involved in the modulation of the actions of centrally administered Ang II on temperature and PRA.",

No significant change was seen in renal vascular resistance (from 30,175 +/- 5,371 to 30,173 +/- 5,372 dynes/second/cm-5/1.73 m2) and in filtration fraction (from 26 +/- 8 to 27 +/- 10 percent). A slight, not significant, decrease in renal plasma flow (from 243 +/- 97 to 217 +/- 108 ml/minute/1.73 m2), in glomerular filtration rate (from 57 +/- 17 to 51 +/- 19 ml/minute/1.73 m2), and in proteinuria (from 4.50 +/- 3.10 to 3.40 +/- 2.31 g/day) was also observed.",

    "217": "The effects of cicletanine were compared with those of three other antihypertensive drugs: prazosin, a highly selective alpha 1 antagonist, captopril an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and indapamide a diuretic antihypertensive agent, on young stroke-prone SHR rats with high salt diet; furthermore, vascular reactivity to cicletanine was studied on isolated rat aorta. At an equal dose (30 mg/kg per os) all the drugs prevent the onset of hypertension with the same intensity. The minimal effective dose on blood pressure was 1 mg/kg for both cicletanine and captopril, and 3 mg/kg for indapamide. The action on diuresis and electrolyte excretion occurs at a dose of cicletanine 10 to 30 times higher than that required to produce the anti-hypertensive effect. One of the possible mechanisms of the antihypertensive effects of cicletanine could be due to a direct action of the drug on the vascular wall. This vascular impact could be an interaction with the alpha-adrenoceptor system (apparent pA2 cicletanine = 5.12) or a decrease in the vascular spasmogenic response whatever agonist was studied.",

Both ramipril and ramiprilat were without effect on basal central and autonomic nervous systems in rats and mice. Ramipril given intravenously to anaesthetized normotensive dogs produced a slight fall in blood pressure but did not significantly alter other cardio-hemodynamic functions. Also, ramiprilat was without effect on isolated atria and airway resistance of guinea pigs. Oral administration of ramipril to dogs increased renal blood flow but did not significantly affect other renal parameters, for example, glomerular filtration rate and electrolyte excretion. Ramipril produced a competitive inhibition of late proximal tubular secretion which points to in part renal secretory excretion of ramipril and/or its metabolites. Compared to urea-induced diuresis in rats, ramipril was without direct diuretic activity. Ramipril exerted little, if any, influence on gastric bile and pancreatic secretion or intestinal transit in rats, as well as on concentration of glucose and lipoproteins, blood coagulation, platelet aggregation and vascular permeability in rats, rabbits or dogs. The carrageenin-induced rat paw edema was enlarged by ramipril, but there was no such effect on serotonin-, dextran- or ovalbumin-induced edemas which in contrast to carrageenin do not involve bradykinin. Thus, undesired cutaneous reactions might result from locally released bradykinin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "219": "The objective of this study was to assess the hemodynamic and neurohumoral (plasma renin activity, aldosterone, epinephrine, norepinephrine, vasopressin, and atrial natriuretic peptide) determinants of systemic vascular resistance in 35 patients with stable congestive heart failure. In the supine position, although activation of the various neurohumoral systems tended to occur in the same patients, there was little correlation between activation of any of the neurohumoral systems, as reflected by circulating levels, and systemic vascular resistance. There was also little correlation between changes in circulating neurohormones and changes in either mean arterial pressure or systemic vascular resistance in the standing position. Acutely reducing the activity of the renin-angiotensin system with the use of captopril did not improve the correlation between other neurohumoral and hemodynamic variables. In fact there was no correlation between the effects of acute captopril therapy and baseline renin values. These results support the concept that activation of one or another vasoconstrictor neurohumoral system varies from patient to patient and that the effects of their activation are tempered by activation of parallel vasodilator systems and by attenuation of neurohormone release and effector organ response.", 
    "220": "The roles of the autonomic nervous system, vasopressin, and angiotensin II in support of blood pressure were evaluated in seven conscious, resting dogs while hydrated or dehydrated. Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) was monitored, and the dogs were given hexamethonium to block autonomic ganglia. Thirty minutes later, they were given captopril, and after another 30 min, a vasopressin V1 antagonist, d(CH2)5TyrMeAVP, was given. The order okf administration of captopril and d(CH2)5TyrMeAVP was alternated in different experiments. Hexamethonium had no effect on steady-state MAP in either hydrated or dehydrated dogs. In hydrated dogs, the average MAP was 100 mmHg; d(CH2)5TyrMeAVP decreased MAP by approximately 12 mmHg, and captopril decreased MAP by 24 mmHg. The magnitude of the effect of these two inhibitors was independent of the order of their administration. Dehydration doubled the effect of d(CH2)5TyrMeAVP on MAP but had no effect on the response to captopril. The results suggest that 1) autonomic function is not essential for maintenance of arterial blood pressure in resting dogs; 2) during autonomic ganglionic blockade, arterial blood pressure is supported by both angiotensin II and vasopressin; and 3) dehydration increases the role of vasopressin in control of blood pressure.", 
    "221": "The chemistry, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical use, adverse effects, and dosage of lisinopril are reviewed. Lisinopril, a new nonsulfhydryl angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, is absorbed in its active form. Like the other ACE inhibitors, it lowers peripheral vascular resistance, with a resultant decrease in blood pressure. Approximately 29% of lisinopril is absorbed after oral administration. No measurable metabolism occurs, and excretion is primarily renal. Accumulation of lisinopril occurs in patients with renal dysfunction; however, dosage adjustment is necessary only when the creatinine clearance is less than 30 mL/min. Lisinopril has been shown to be an effective antihypertensive agent at doses of 10 to 80 mg given once daily in patients with essential and secondary hypertension caused by renal artery stenosis. The effectiveness of lisinopril is comparable to that with diuretics, beta blockers, and calcium-channel antagonists. In patients who are unresponsive to maximal doses of lisinopril alone, addition of another antihypertensive agent may be beneficial. Limited information suggests that lisinopril may be comparable to captopril for the treatment of congestive heart failure. Adverse effects associated with lisinopril are relatively minor and are comparable to those associated with enalapril. Hematological abnormalities have not been reported with lisinopril. Class-related adverse effects include cough, azotemia, angioedema, hypotension, and hyperkalemia. Lisinopril appears to be comparable to other ACE inhibitors for the treatment of hypertension and may be as effective as its predecessors for the treatment of congestive heart failure. Further study is needed to better define a therapeutic niche for lisinopril.", 
    "222": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of the ACE inhibitor enalapril (E) on blood pressure and metabolic control in 15 hypertensive patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. When the treatment goal was not reached with enalapril alone, hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) was added. A diastolic blood pressure (DBP) below 90 mmHg was achieved in seven patients with enalapril alone (47%), and in an additional four (27%) with concomitant hydrochlorothiazide. No significant adverse effects of enalapril occurred and all patients completed the study. Monotherapy with enalapril did not affect metabolic control or renal function. Addition of HCTZ to E did not consistently result in further lowering of blood pressure and caused deterioration of both the degree of metabolic control and renal function. We, therefore, conclude that monotherapy with enalapril can be a safe and satisfactory treatment for hypertensive patients with NIDDM. Caution is needed, however, when HCTZ is added, since this may adversely affect metabolic control and renal function whereas the effect on blood pressure may be variable.", 
    "223": "To investigate the relationship between cardiac hypertrophy associated with hypertension, and the alterations in myocardial lipid metabolism, nicardipine (160 mg/kg/day), hydralazine (40 mg/kg/day), and enalapril (30 mg/kg/day) were administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats from 20 to 24 weeks of age. Drug administration significantly suppressed the increases in blood pressure and the ratio of left ventricular weight to body weight. A marked variation in the fatty acid binding capacities of the delipidated, dealbuminated heart cytosol obtained from these animals was observed in the 24-week-old rats (5.40 +/- 0.31 pmol/micrograms protein in non-treated rats; 4.73 +/- 0.34 pmol/mg protein in nicardipine-treated rats; 5.01 +/- 0.34 pmol/mg protein in hydralazine-treated rats; 4.61 +/- 0.26 pmol/mg protein in enalapril-treated rats) as compared to the 20-week-old non-treated rats (3.38 +/- 0.29 pmol/mg protein). The decrease in this capacity in the drug-treated groups closely correlated with the reduction of cardiac mass, suggesting that the factors governing regression may be closely related to those governing fatty acid binding capacity. It appears that fatty acid binding protein may play an important role in the hypertension-associated hypertrophic myocardium.",

To validate this principle, we studied 38 elderly males (aged greater than or equal to 65 years) with mild to moderate hypertension, comparing hemodynamic responses to and subjective impressions of enalapril or hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). After gradual withdrawal of existing antihypertensive therapy and a four-week, single-blind placebo period, each patient was randomized in a double-blind fashion to receive either enalapril 10-20 mg/d or HCTZ 12.5-25 mg/d for two to four weeks. Combination therapy with both agents was employed if either alone failed to reduce seated diastolic BP to less than or equal to 90 mm Hg. Equivalent proportions of patients receiving enalapril or HCTZ (8 of 19 and 10 of 19, respectively; p = ns) responded with significant reductions in systolic and diastolic BP in seated and standing positions. Combination therapy was most effective in patients receiving HCTZ prior to enalapril. In patients receiving enalapril before HCTZ, BP changes were minimal. No adverse effects were observed in the enalapril group but occurred in an equivalent fraction of patients in the other groups (4 of 10 HCTZ alone, 6 of 20 enalapril + HCTZ; p = ns). We conclude that enalapril may be considered a reasonable monotherapeutic antihypertensive agent in some elderly patients. Combination with HCTZ is beneficial in patients who fail to respond adequately to HCTZ alone.", 
    "225": "Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (thalamate clearance), renal plasma flow (RPF) (hippuran clearance), and urinary albumin excretion rate (AER) were measured in 10 normoalbuminuric, normotensive insulin-dependent diabetic patients and 8 normal subjects before and during acute angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition by means of enalapril (10 mg IV). The effect of placebo versus enalapril (30 mg day-1) was also studied for 3-month treatment periods in the insulin-dependent diabetic patients. Acute ACE-inhibition caused a decline in filtration fraction (FF) from 0.259 +/- 0.011 (+/- SE) to 0.237 +/- 0.013 (2p less than 0.01) in the diabetic patients, and from 0.210 +/- 0.010 to 0.188 +/- 0.006 (2p less than 0.02) in the normal subjects. Mean arterial blood pressure was lowered from 90 +/- 1 to 84 +/- 2 mmHg (2p less than 0.01) and from 91 +/- 1 to 86 +/- 2 mmHg (2p less than 0.05). No significant change in blood glucose, AER or fractional albumin excretion (theta Alb) was seen in either group. After 3 months of enalapril treatment FF was decreased from 0.253 +/- 0.011 to 0.235 +/- 0.011 (2p less than 0.05), AER from 5.6 x/ divided by 1.7 to 4.3 x/divided by 1.6 micrograms min-1 (2p less than 0.01) and theta Alb from 1.22 +/- 0.22 x 10(-6) to 0.92 +/- 0.12 x 10(-6) (2p less than 0.02). The decline in total renal resistance was not significant (0.175 +/- 0.013 to 0.165 +/- 0.012 mmHg ml-1 min-1) and significant changes in GFR, RPF, mean arterial pressure or HbA1c were not observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "226": "To help elucidate potential sites for the central actions of a new angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, perindopril, ACE levels were measured in the brain of Sprague-Dawley rats by quantitative in vitro autoradiography after administration of the drug. Following acute oral administration of 1 mg/kg perindopril, ACE in the two circumventricular organs, the subfornical organ and organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis, was markedly inhibited and had only partially recovered after 24 h. The ACE inhibition in the circumventricular organs did not correlate with the inhibition of ACE in plasma but with that of pressor response to intravenous angiotensin I. No or little change in ACE was observed in other brain structures which are rich in the enzyme, including the choroid plexus and basal ganglia. However, large doses of perindopril (up to 16 mg/kg) did progressively inhibit ACE in all brain structures measured, including the basal ganglia. These findings fit with the deficient blood-brain barrier known to occur in the circumventricular organs. These regions are rich in ACE and angiotensin II receptors and exhibit physiological responses to angiotensin II with effects on fluid, electrolyte, and blood pressure homeostasis. Combined with current observations, the circumventricular organs are potential targets for the centrally mediated actions of ACE inhibitors.", 
    "227": "Severe hypertension may be a difficult management issue, and it often requires therapy with multiple drugs at frequent dosing intervals. We report on the antihypertensive effects of the alpha-beta adrenergic blocking agent, labetalol, in combination with enalapril, a long-acting angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, administered to 14 patients with severe hypertension (nine of whom had nephrosclerosis or renal artery stenosis) on other antihypertensive drug therapies. Blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), hematologic and blood chemistry values, and adverse side effects were monitored at 24 hours, 1 week, and 4 weeks of therapy. Rapid titration of the drugs was performed in the hospital in 10 patients; four were managed closely as outpatients. Following one month of combination therapy blood pressure decreased from 212 +/- 31/120 +/- 16 mm Hg at baseline to 155 +/- 19/86 +/- 12 mm Hg, and heart rate declined from 86 +/- 18 bpm to 70 +/- 16 bpm. Ten of the 14 patients (71%) maintained good BP control (BP less than 140/90 mm Hg) with no additional treatment. Serum potassium, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen concentrations, and hematologic parameters did not significantly change in 13 of 14 patients. Three patients developed symptomatic postural hypotension; in one patient this side effect resulted in discontinuation from the study. These data suggest that combination therapy with labetalol and enalapril is effective in lowering BP in patients with severe essential or renovascular hypertension. An additional advantage of this regimen is the twice-daily dosing interval, which may promote better long-term compliance.", 
    "228": "The mechanisms underlying drug-induced neutropenia are poorly characterized. We have examined the mechanism of suppression of granulocytopoiesis by captopril and penicillamine using human and canine bone marrow cells in an in vitro culture system. Addition of captopril caused no significant change in granulocyte-macrophage colony formation at concentrations up to 30 micrograms/ml. In the presence of CuSO4 (1-3 micrograms/ml), however, captopril caused significant inhibition of colony growth (p less than 0.05). Penicillamine, another agent associated with neutropenia and, like captopril, having a reactive thiol group, also inhibited colony formation in the presence of copper. Chemical congeners of captopril lacking a reactive thiol group and enalaprilic acid, an alternative angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, failed to show inhibition, suggesting that the thiol group and not ACE inhibition was responsible. Analysis of day-7 colonies (98% neutrophilic) and day-21 colonies (37% neutrophilic, 30% macrophagic, 27% eosinophilic, and 6% mixed) showed that neutrophil-containing colonies, but not nonneutrophilic colonies were inhibited by the addition of captopril plus copper. Catalase totally reversed the inhibition of colony formation caused by these agents. Direct measurement of oxygen consumption in the presence of captopril showed marked enhancement with the addition of CuSO4 and a 48% reduction in the presence of added catalase. These data indicate that drugs with a reactive thiol group can interact with copper to generate H2O2, which can be toxic to neutrophilic progenitor cells. We postulate that this may be an important mechanism for drug-associated neutropenia and a general mechanism for drug-induced marrow cell injury.", 
    "229": "Captopril-induced gastric motor response, reflected as change in intragastric pressure (IGP) in rats under urethane anaesthesia, was investigated. Single injection (i.v.) of captopril decreased the gastric motor tone in 2 distinct phases: a transient (6-10 min) short-latency relaxation (SLR) was followed by a long-lasting (1 hr) delayed relaxation (DGR). The SLR coincided with the time course of simultaneously evoked changes in the cardiorespiratory parameters by captopril. Neither phase of the gastric relaxation exhibited dose-dependency. The kallikrein inhibitor, aprotinin markedly attenuated both phases of the relaxation, the angiotensin II antagonist saralasin was without significant effect. The DGR was sensitive to subdiaphragmatic vagotomy, bilateral adrenalectomy, propranolol (3 mg/kg) and indomethacin (10 mg/kg), but resistant to guanethidine (5 mg/kg). The SLR was only partially blocked by vagotomy, guanethidine and indomethacin. It was almost abolished by adrenalectomy, though insensitive to propranolol. It is argued that the captopril-induced gastric relaxation, especially the DGR, is predominantly due to the enhanced endogenous kinin activity which reflexly releases adrenal medullary catecholamines by exciting chemosensitive vagal afferents of abdominal origin. This kinin-induced activation of vagal afferents seems to be mediated by prostaglandins.", 
    "230": "Substance P (SP) acutely enhanced the plasma concentration of aldosterone in rats whose hypothalamo-hypophyseal-adrenal axis and renin-angiotensin system were pharmacologically interrupted. The maximal response was obtained with a dose of 100 micrograms/kg. A prolonged (7 days) subcutaneous infusion with SP (50 micrograms/kg/hr) caused a notable hypertrophy of zona glomerulosa cells associated with significant rises in both basal and angiotensin-stimulated plasma levels of aldosterone. Zona fasciculata and the blood concentration of corticosterone were not affected. These findings suggest that SP is specifically involved in the stimulation of the growth and secretory activity of the rat zona glomerulosa.", 
    "231": "A novel inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) has been discovered and isolated in a pure form from acid extract of tuna muscle by successive column chromatographies and HPLC. The final preparation showed IC50 values of 1 microM and 2 microM for ACEs from bovine and rabbit lungs, respectively. The amino acid sequence of the inhibitor has been established as Pro-Thr-His-Ile-Lys-Trp-Gly-Asp by the Edman procedure and carboxypeptidase digestion.", 
    "232": "Based on data from three studies with complete recording of adverse events in about 12,000 patients each, we determined that angioedema in association with the angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitor enalapril maleate occurred during the first week of therapy at the rate of one case per 3000 patients per week. Thereafter, the incidence was 14-fold lower, without evidence of a temporal trend in incidence beyond the first week of therapy. The cumulative incidence was one case per 1000 patients treated (0.1%). An additional 138 case reports consistent with the diagnosis of angioedema were obtained from our overall controlled and marketed experience using enalapril in more than 1.2 million patients. These reports were examined to further characterize the reaction. The cases generally were mild, and they resolved on discontinuation of drug therapy. Seven patients experienced angioedema or urticaria in association with both enalapril and captopril, a structurally different angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitor. This further suggested that the side effect is mechanism based. If angioedema is suspected, therapy with any angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitor should be interrupted promptly, respiratory distress should be treated appropriately, and subsequent therapy should be initiated with an agent from an alternative class of medication.", 
    "233": "A peptidase that inactivated neurotensin by cleaving the peptide at the Pro10-Tyr11 bond, generating the biologically inactive fragments neurotensin(1-10) and neurotensin(11-13) was purified from whole rat ileum homogenate. The purified enzyme behaved as a 70-75-kDa monomer as determined by SDS-PAGE analysis in reducing or non-reducing conditions and gel permeation on Ultrogel AcA34. The peptidase was insensitive to thiol-blocking agents and acidic and serine protease inhibitors but could be strongly inhibited by 1,10-phenanthroline, EDTA, dithiothreitol and heavy metal ions such as zinc, copper and cobalt. Zinc was the only divalent cation able potently to reactivate the apoenzyme. This enzyme could be distinguished from endopeptidases EC 3.4.24.15 and EC 3.4.24.11, angiotensin-converting enzyme, proline endopeptidase, aminopeptidase and pyroglutamyl-peptide hydrolase since it was not affected by micromolar concentrations of their specific inhibitors. The peptidase displayed a high affinity for neurotensin (1.6 microM). Studies concerning the specificity of the enzyme towards the sequence of neurotensin established the following. (a) Neurotensin(9-13) was the shortest partial sequence that fully inhibited tritiated neurotensin degradation; shortening the C-terminal part of the neurotensin molecule led to inactive fragments. (b) Amidation of the C-terminal end of the peptide did not prevent the recognition by the peptidase. (c) There existed a strong stereospecificity of the peptidase for the residues in positions 8, 9 and 11 of the neurotensin molecule. (d) Pro-Xaa dipeptides (where Xaa represented aromatic or hydrophobic residues) were the most potent inhibitors of tritiated neurotensin degradation while all the Xaa-Pro dipeptides tested were totally ineffective. (e) The neurotensin-related peptides: neuromedin N, xenopsin and [Lys8-Asn9]neurotensin(8-13), as well as angiotensins I and II and dynorphins(1-8) and (1-13) were as potent as neurotensin in inhibiting [3H]neurotensin hydrolysis.", 
    "234": "The ability of captopril and one of its metabolites, the disulphide dimer have been studied for their ability to affect angiotensin I and bradykinin responses. Captopril disulphide dimer (i.v.) potentiated the vasodilatory effects of bradykinin in urethane-anaesthetized rats, at doses of 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg but did not inhibit the angiotensin I-mediated pressor response at these same concentrations. This activity of captopril disulphide dimer in vivo was not seen with bradykinin responses in isolated guinea pig ileum except at bath concentrations much higher than for captopril (10(-5) M). However captopril and captopril disulphide dimer at oral doses of 10 mg/kg both lowered systolic and diastolic blood pressures in spontaneously hypertensive rats. These studies are consistent with an in vivo bradykinin-potentiating activity of captopril disulphide dimer and suggest a possible antihypertensive activity of disulphide metabolites of captopril.", 
    "235": "Pleurisy was induced in rats by an intrapleural injection of 0.5 ml of 1% kaolin. The exudation of plasma into the pleural cavity showed two peaks at 20 min and 3-5 h after the kaolin injection. The volume of the pleural fluid increased gradually up to 5 h. The effects of treatment with mepyramine, methysergide, captopril, bromelain and indomethacin suggested that the early phase (20 min) of exudation was mediated mainly by kinins, histamine and 5-HT, and that the late phase (3 h) was mediated by prostaglandins (PGs) and possibly kinins. We measured the levels of histamine, kinin and PG in the pleural exudate to verify the involvement of the mediators mentioned above. Intracellular histamine levels decreased markedly and extracellular histamine levels increased significantly 20 min after the induction of kaolin pleurisy. Only threshold levels of kinin were detected after the induction of pleurisy. Captopril treatment, however, increased kinin levels which peaked at 20 min and decreased rapidly thereafter. Levels of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and thromboxane B2 showed a peak at 20 min, whereas levels of PGE2 increased gradually from 20 min to 5 h. These results indicate that kaolin-induced pleurisy is a kinin-related inflammation and could be used as a model for studying the in vivo interaction of the kallikrein-kinin system and PGs at inflammatory sites.", 
    "236": "Although kinins have been reported to affect cerebral vascular tone and permeability, their actions are not potentiated by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. To investigate cerebral vascular kinin metabolism, porcine cerebral microvessels were isolated by differential sieving and centrifugation and characterized by microscopic examination and marker enzyme enrichment. Purified microvessels contained a membrane-bound carboxypeptidase which hydrolyzed the C-terminal Phe-Arg bond of both kallidin and bradykinin. Hydrolysis was optimal at pH 7.0, was activated more than 300% by 0.1 mM CoCl2, and was inhibited by o-phenanthroline and the carboxypeptidase N (EC 3.4.17.3) inhibitor DL-2-mercaptomethyl-3-guanidino-ethylthiopropanoic acid (MERGETPA) (IC50 = 2 microM). Conversely, inhibitors of angiotensin I converting enzyme (captopril), neutral endopeptidase (phosphoramidon), post proline cleaving enzyme (Z-Pro-prolinal), dipeptidyl(amino)peptidase IV (diprotin A) and amino-peptidase M (amastatin) had no effect. When the rates of C-terminal hydrolysis of kallidin by detergent-solubilized cerebral microvasculature were determined over a range of substrate concentrations (16.6 to 250 microM), the Km and Vmax values obtained were 26.0 +/- 3.0 microM and 14.7 +/- 1.3 nmol/min/ml (N = 4) respectively. These data suggest that a cerebral microvascular carboxypeptidase may play a role in vivo in modulating the effects of kinins on cerebral blood flow and permeability and in preventing circulating kinins from crossing the blood-brain barrier.", 
    "237": "The concentration of luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) (pGlu-His-Trp-Ser-Tyr-Gly-Leu-Arg-Pro-Gly-NH2), which reaches the anterior pituitary via the hypothalamo-hypophyseal portal system, appears to be controlled in part by the rate of LHRH degradation within the hypothalamus and/or pituitary. Specific, active site-directed endopeptidase inhibitors synthesized in our laboratory were used to identify the enzyme(s) involved in LHRH degradation by hypothalamic and pituitary membrane preparations, and by an intact anterior pituitary tumor cell line (AtT20). Incubation of LHRH with pituitary and hypothalamic membrane preparations led to the formation of pGlu-His-Trp (LHRH1-3) as the main reaction product. Under the same conditions, addition to the incubation mixtures of captopril, an inhibitor of the angiotensin converting enzyme, led to accumulation of pGlu-His-Trp-Ser-Tyr (LHRH1-5) and, to a lesser extent, pGlu-His-Trp-Ser-Tyr (LHRH1-6). The degradation of LHRH and the formation of the N-terminal tri- and pentapeptides was blocked by N-[1-(R,S)-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl]-Ala-Ala-Phe-p-aminobenzoate (cFP-AAF-pAB), a specific, active site directed inhibitor of endopeptidase-24.15. Some inhibition of LHRH degradation and formation of the N-terminal hexapeptide was also obtained in the presence of N-[1-carboxy-2-phenylethyl]-Phe-p-aminobenzoate (cFE-F-pAB), an inhibitor of endopeptidase-24.11. Similar results were obtained with AtT20 cell membranes and with intact AtT20 cells in monolayer culture. Following cleavage by endopeptidases the C-terminal part of LHRH was rapidly degraded by aminopeptidases. Superactive analogs of LHRH in which Gly6 was replaced by a D-amino acid are resistant to degradation by both endopeptidase-24.11 and -24.15. In vivo, when LHRH was injected directly into the third ventricle of rats, the presence of cFP-AAF-pAB inhibited LHRH degradation. It is concluded that LHRH degradation is primarily initiated by the membrane-bound form of endopeptidase-24.15 to yield pGlu-His-Trp-Ser-Tyr and to a lesser extent by endopeptidase-24.11 to yield pGlu-His-Trp-Ser-Tyr-Gly.", 
    "238": "When captopril was first introduced for the management of hypertension, its short plasma half-life led to its use as a thrice daily regimen. However, further experience suggests that the biological action is more prolonged than the plasma half-life might suggest. This study examined the effect of varying the frequency of administration (once, twice and three times daily) of a fixed daily dosage of 75 mg captopril on ambulatory BP in a double-blind cross-over study in 15 patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Each patient had six ambulatory BP recordings with placebo alternating with active phase. The three regimens (75 mg daily, 37.5 mg twice daily and 25 mg three times daily) reduced the daily mean BP equally and significantly compared with placebo. Three patients with very high pretreatment plasma renin values showed some loss of BP control immediately prior to the first dose in the morning in the 75 mg single dose phase (i.e. 24 hours post dose); but group analysis showed no difference in mean BP at this time point with the three treatment regimens. We conclude that in spite of its short plasma half-life, captopril can effectively control BP over the whole day with a once daily regimen.", 
    "239": "Congestive heart failure (CHF) is not a single entity but a symptom complex that may represent the consequence of mechanical abnormalities, myocardial abnormalities, and/or disturbances of cardiac rhythm. In turn, it affects virtually every organ system in the body. This review focuses on CHF due to systolic dysfunction of the left ventricle, which comprises the majority of cases of this condition. Recent data suggest that CHF may be the most frequent primary diagnosis in patients on medical services in nonmilitary hospitals in this country: it affects approximately 2% of the United States population, or some 4 million people. The mortality rate for CHF is also worse than for many forms of cancer; thus, new therapeutic alternatives are imperative. In order to devise new therapeutic strategies, a detailed understanding of the pathophysiology of this condition is required. The relative advantages and disadvantages of various pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches are considered in detail. Certain medications, such as the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, have been shown to improve survival, and heart transplantation is clearly life-saving for those who are eligible for this therapy. However, the real challenge is to devise strategies to prevent the occurrence of heart failure, or interrupt its progress at a very early stage.", 
    "240": "Thirst mechanisms in Brattleboro rats are activated because of a deficiency in circulating vasopressin. Plasma osmolality, renin, and angiotensin II (ANG II) are increased. We measured the responsiveness of Brattleboro rats and appropriate control strains to cellular and extracellular thirst stimuli taking the spontaneous base-line water intake into account. Brattleboro rats drank more in response to intraperitoneal hypertonic NaCl than controls, but when their fluid losses were prevented by nephrectomy they did not overdrink. Despite low urinary concentration, Brattleboro rats excreted the sodium load at least as rapidly as the controls. Brattleboro rats drank after intracranial injection of renin, renin substrate, and ANG I and II. The dose-response curves were similar to controls, although the Nottingham Long-Evans control strain drank significantly less in response to some doses of the peptides. Intracranial captopril inhibited renin- and ANG I-induced but not ANG II-induced drinking. Isoproterenol reduced spontaneous drinking of Brattleboro rats but increased drinking in controls. However, when urinary losses were prevented by ureteric ligation, isoproterenol caused markedly greater water intake in Brattleboro rats than in controls. Subcutaneous captopril in moderate, thirst-enhancing doses also caused a larger increase in water intake in Brattleboro rats than in controls. Therefore the renin-angiotensin system of Brattleboro rats is more responsive to renin-dependent thirst challenges than that of normal controls.", 
    "241": "Cows depleted of Na by loss of saliva from a parotid fistula for 46 h had an avid appetite for Na solution. They drank 21.0 +/- 1.6 liter of 0.3 M NaHCO3-NaCl solution during 2 h of access but little or no water during that time. Solutions of angiotensin II or captopril were infused for 3 h intravenously or into a lateral ventricle (intracerebroventricular) beginning 1 h before access to Na solution. Intravenous angiotensin II increased Na intake (to 26.8 +/- 2.9 liter, P less than 0.01) but did not alter water intake. Intracerebroventricular angiotensin II increased water intake but did not alter Na intake. Intravenous captopril reduced Na intake (to 11.0 +/- 2.1 liter, P less than 0.001) and concurrent intravenous angiotensin II prevented the reduction but concurrent intracerebroventricular angiotensin II did not. Intracerebroventricular captopril did not alter Na or water intake. Intravenous captopril reduced to zero the water intake during the hour before Na access, and concurrent intravenous angiotensin II prevented that reduction also. The dipsogenic action of intracerebroventricular angiotensin II was potentiated by intravenous captopril. The results of these experiments suggest that if angiotensin II receptors involved in the mechanism regulating Na appetite are in the brain, they are accessible only from the blood, e.g., in circumventricular organs. Thirst was inhibited by reduction of angiotensin II in blood but was stimulated only by angiotensin II acting inside the blood-brain barrier.", 
    "242": "The therapeutic usefulness of adding once-daily amlodipine (10 mg) for four weeks in moderate-severe hypertensive patients uncontrolled on low dose captopril (25 mg twice daily) alone was studied in 29 patients in a double-blind, placebo-controlled two-way crossover comparison. Once daily amlodipine was shown to be an effective antihypertensive drug when combined with captopril. The amlodipine minus placebo differences in mean changes from captopril baseline values were: -18/-12 mmHg and -20/-12 mmHg for supine and standing systolic/diastolic pressures (P less than 0.001 for all four pressure variables). The combination was well tolerated, and no patient discontinued therapy. Five patients experienced ankle oedema and four patients reported flushing while receiving amlodipine/captopril.", 
    "243": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are a group of drugs recently introduced to treat hypertension and congestive heart failure. There are many reports of a dry cough in patients treated with (ACE) inhibitors, but this is often considered a rare side effect. Eleven of 30 patients treated with the investigational ACE inhibitor cilazapril complained about a chronic cough.", 
    "244": "The reduction in blood pressure (BP) after the first dose and after 8 weeks of treatment with a new once-daily angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, ramipril, was examined in 12 untreated hypertensive patients, using ambulatory intraarterial BP monitoring. The first period of monitoring began 24 hours before the first dose was given, and continued for 24 hours afterwards. A second 24-hour period of monitoring was carried out after 8 weeks of treatment, commencing immediately after the morning dose. Angiotensin II levels and serum drug levels were measured at 0, 2, 6 and 24 hours after the acute dose. BP decreased progressively from the first hour after the first dose, reached a maximum in the fifth hour (p less than 0.001) and then the effect diminished. The maximum reduction of systolic BP in any patient was 64 mm Hg, the minimum 4 mm Hg. Blood pressure was significantly (p less than 0.05) reduced throughout the 24 hours after dosing, with a mean daytime reduction of 13/12 mm Hg, and a mean nighttime reduction of 15/7 mm Hg. Angiotensin II levels were significantly (p less than 0.02) and maximally reduced by 2 hours after administration, but the reduction was no longer significant after 24 hours. Serum drug levels were also maximal 2 hours after administration. The trial population could be clearly divided into groups of good and poor responders on the basis of BP reduction. The angiotensin II levels were higher before treatment, and decreased further, in all patients with a good response than in those with a poor response.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "245": "We assessed blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) responses in a double-blind, randomized study comparing cilazapril, a long-acting, nonsulfhydryl-group converting enzyme inhibitor, with placebo in 18 patients with mild to moderate (sitting diastolic BP, 95 to 114 mm Hg) essential hypertension. The BP and HR parameters were evaluated at rest (casual, 24 hours after administration), during treadmill exercise testing (Bruce protocol), and with 24-hour noninvasive ambulatory BP monitoring. These assessments were made after a 4-week drug washout period and after 8 to 12 weeks of therapy. After 8 weeks of therapy with cilazapril (mean dose 3.6 +/- 0.9 mg/day), casual BP decreased 19/11 mm Hg (p less than 0.01), whereas placebo lowered BP by 4/5 mm Hg (difference not significant) compared with the baseline period. The casual HR was modestly (7 beats/min) but significantly (p less than 0.05) lowered by cilazapril monotherapy. Exercise BP was reduced by cilazapril (reduction at peak HR, 23/11 +/- 10/5 mm Hg; p less than 0.05), and exercise HR was unchanged. Compared with baseline, the duration of exercise was improved with cilazapril but not with placebo (1.0 minute vs -0.2 minute; p less than 0.05). Twenty-four-hour mean, awake, and sleep BPs were reduced with cilazapril with the most impressive reduction occurring during the awake period (19/12 mm Hg; p less than 0.01). These data demonstrate that cilazapril lowers casual, exercise, and ambulatory BP with a modest but significant improvement in exercise time. Thus cilazapril may be particularly effective in the physically active hypertensive patient.", 
    "246": "Inactivation of dynorphin-(1-8) in three in vitro isolated preparations, guinea-pig ileum, mouse vas deferens and rabbit vas deferens, was estimated by employing the relatively specific inhibitors of enkephalin-hydrolyzing enzymes. All three enzyme inhibitors, amastatin, captopril and phosphoramidon, significantly enhanced the inhibitory potency of dynorphin-(1-8) in the three isolated preparations. The magnitude of the enhancement of the dynorphin potency by captopril was significantly higher than that by either amastatin or phosphoramidon in guinea-pig ileum; that by amastatin was significantly higher than that by either captopril or phosphoramidon in rabbit vas deferens; and that by amastatin was similar to that by captopril, but significantly higher than that by phosphoramidon in mouse vas deferens. The Ke values of three antagonists, naloxone, Mr 2266 and ICI 154129, against dynorphin-(1-8) in the presence of the three peptidase inhibitors indicated that dynorphin-(1-8) acted on kappa receptors in guinea-pig ileum and on both kappa and delta receptors in mouse vas deferens. Since amastatin, captopril and phosphoramidon produced the naloxone-reversible inhibition of contractions of guinea-pig ileum in the presence of dynorphin-(1-8), all three dynorphin-inactivating enzymes were indicated to be located very close to kappa receptors.", 
    "247": "Although the serotonin uptake inhibitors have been shown to reduce alcohol intake in both animals and man, the mechanism of this effect is unclear. It is known that enhanced serotonergic activity can stimulate activity in the renin-angiotensin system and that elevated activity in the renin-angiotensin system can reduce voluntary alcohol intake. Therefore, serotonin uptake inhibitors such as fluoxetine might exert their effect on alcohol intake, in part, through the renin-angiotensin system. The present experiment assesses this possibility by examining the effect of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril, on the fluoxetine-induced decrease in alcohol intake. Four groups of rats were offered limited access to alcohol for 1 hr each day. When intake stabilized each group was injected with 2.5, 5.0 or 10.0 mg/kg of fluoxetine or the saline vehicle 1 hr prior to the access to alcohol. Fluoxetine produced a dose-dependent decrease in alcohol intake. Following this, all groups received injections of 1 mg/kg of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril, 40 min prior to the fluoxetine. Enalapril had no effect on alcohol intake in the saline group, but reversed the suppression in alcohol intake produced by the 2.5 mg/kg and 5.0 mg/kg doses of fluoxetine and partially reversed the effect of the 10.0 mg/kg dose. These findings indicate that the fluoxetine-induced reduction in alcohol intake may, in part, be mediated through the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "248": "The comparative effects of lisinopril, a third generation angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, on components of the renin-angiotensin system were assessed in normal and in an animal model of diabetes-related hypertension, the streptozotocin-diabetic rat. Two weeks after injection of streptozotocin the mean systolic blood pressure of diabetic rats was elevated 11% above that of normal rats. This effect was prevented by daily injection of insulin. The mean serum ACE activity was elevated 71% above that of normal rats. Lisinopril reduced systolic blood pressure and inhibited serum ACE activity in both normal and diabetic rats in a dose-response fashion. In normal rats maximum inhibition of blood pressure occurred at a mean dose of 1.0 mg/kg and in the diabetic rat at a mean dose of 5.0 mg/kg. At a mean dose of 5 mg/kg, ACE was inhibited by 100 and 92% in normal and diabetic rats, respectively. Plasma renin activity (PRA) increased sharply in both groups of rats treated with the lower doses of lisinopril, only to decrease at the 5 mg/kg level. At 20 mg/kg, PRA continued to decline in normal animals, but not in diabetic rats. Formation of angiotensin II (Ang II) in both normal and diabetic rats was maximally inhibited at doses of 1.0 and 0.1 mg/kg of lisinopril, respectively without a significantly greater effect at the higher doses of the drug. In separate experiments the effects of chronic treatment with lisinopril at two dosage levels on various physiological parameters of streptozotocin-diabetic rats were compared with the effects of another hypotensive agent, hydralazine, an arteriolar vasodilator.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "249": "Transmural electrical stimulation (2-20 Hz) produced a frequency-dependent contraction in dog mesenteric, monkey mesenteric and human gastroepiploic arterial strips, which was abolished by tetrodotoxin and suppressed by phentolamine. Treatment with yohimbine (10(-9) and 10(-8) M) potentiated the response to nerve stimulation dose-dependently in the dog arteries, but rather attenuated the response of the primate arteries. Yohimbine (10(-8) M) attenuated the contraction caused by exogenous norepinephrine in the dog and monkey arteries. Angiotensin (ANG) II (2 X 10(-10) M) and ANG I (10(-9) M) potentiated the response to transmural stimulation in the dog and monkey arteries, whereas the response to norepinephrine was unaffected. The ANG I-induced potentiation was suppressed by treatment with ANG converting enzyme inhibitors. 3H-Overflow evoked by transmural stimulation in tissues prelabeled with [3H] norepinephrine was increased by yohimbine in the superfused dog arteries but was not increased significantly in the monkey arteries. The overflow was increased significantly by ANG II in the dog and monkey arteries. It may be concluded that prejunctional alpha-2 adrenoceptors mediating the inhibition of transmitter release do not function significantly in human gastroepiploic and monkey mesenteric arteries, and postjunctional alpha-2 receptors are involved partly in contractions of the monkey arteries due to adrenergic nerve stimulation. ANG II appears to be synthesized from ANG I via ANG converting enzyme in the primate arteries; the octapeptide potentiates the contraction caused by adrenergic nerve stimulation, possibly due to prejunctional ANG receptor activation and increased norepinephrine release.", 
    "250": "The hemodynamic effects of varying oral doses of the long-acting converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril were studied in an acute, single-blind, parallel fashion in 55 patients with moderate to severe congestive heart failure. Doses of 2.5, 5.0, and 10 mg produced a significant increase in cardiac index and significant reductions in pulmonary capillary wedge, right atrial, pulmonary arterial, and systemic arterial pressures and systemic vascular resistance. The changes were present up to 24 hours after dosing for most parameters. There was a clear-cut dose-response relationship observed. Forty-seven patients were followed over a 3-month period, during which functional status and exercise tolerance improved. Although 26% showed some evidence of renal dysfunction with lisinopril, these changes could be normalized by decreasing either the lisinopril or the diuretic dose. These data demonstrate that the hemodynamic changes with the long-acting converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril can be modulated with dose adjustment in patients with congestive heart failure. They also suggest that renal function changes may be normalized by adjustment of either the dose of lisinopril or the diuretic dose.", 
    "251": "Streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats showed a significant lowering in both PRA (-31%) and basal plasma aldosterone concentration (-59%), coupled with a notable atrophy of the zona glomerulosa (-30%) and its parenchymal cells (-36%). Kalaemia and the blood level of ACTH were not affected. Insulin infusion reversed all the streptozotocin-evoked effects. Analogous, though less conspicuous, changes were induced by experimental diabetes also in rats whose hypothalamo-hypophyseal-adrenal axis and renin-angiotensin system had been pharmacologically interrupted by the simultaneous administration of dexamethasone-captopril and maintenance doses of ACTH-angiotensin II: the drops in the basal plasma aldosterone concentration and in the volume of zona glomerulosa and its cells ranged from -20% to -22%. In these animals, experimental diabetes significantly depressed the aldosterone response to the acute stimulation with angiotensin II (-55%), potassium (-50%), and ACTH (-43%). These findings indicate that the well known impairment of renin release may only partially account for the antiadrenoglomerulotrophic effect of experimental diabetes in rats. The hypothesis is advanced that the chronic lack of insulin may directly depress both the growth of the zona glomerulosa and the newly synthesis of some enzymes of aldosterone synthesis.", 
    "252": "Dihydropyridine calcium antagonists such as isradipine (PN200-110) selectively increase blood flow to the heart, brain, and skeletal muscle. The role of the renin-angiotensin system in bringing about this pattern of selectivity was investigated in two groups of eight barbiturate-anesthetized rabbits. One group was and the other one was not pretreated with 1 mg/kg i.v. of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, spirapril. In the group with the intact renin-angiotensin system, isradipine (3 and 10 micrograms/kg i.v.) elicited the typical systemic and regional (measured with 15 micron tracer microspheres) hemodynamic effects of a noncardiodepressant dihydropyridine derivative. Inhibition of the angiotensin converting enzyme blunted the effects of isradipine on central venous pressure, cardiac output, and flow to the heart, brain, and skeletal muscle. The isradipine-induced decrease of hepatic arterial and pancreatic blood flow was prevented and a similar tendency was observed in the spleen, stomach, small intestine, cecum, and arteriovenous shunt flow, indicating that the renin-angiotensin system was totally (liver, pancreas) or partially responsible for the effects of isradipine on these vessels. The renin-angiotensin system thus counteracts the dilator effect of calcium antagonists in angiotensin II sensitive vascular beds and participates in bringing about the typical pattern of regional vasodilation of these agents.", 
    "253": "We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine whether ventricular dilatation continues during the late convalescent phase after myocardial infarction and whether therapy with captopril alters this process. Fifty-nine patients with a first anterior myocardial infarction and a radionuclide ejection fraction of 45 percent or less underwent cardiac catheterization 11 to 31 days after infarction, when they were not in overt congestive heart failure. They were randomly assigned to placebo or captopril and were followed for one year. A repeat catheterization was performed to evaluate interval changes in hemodynamic function and left ventricular volume. Thirty-eight male patients were evaluated with maximal-exercise treadmill tests every three months. No differences were detected at base line in clinical, hemodynamic, or quantitative ventriculographic variables. During one year of follow-up, the end-diastolic volume of the left ventricle increased by a mean [+/- SEM] of 21 +/- 8 ml (P less than 0.02) in the placebo group, but by only 10 +/- 6 ml (P not significant) in the captopril group. The left ventricular filling pressure remained elevated with placebo but decreased (P less than 0.01) with captopril. In a subset of 36 patients who were at high risk for ventricular enlargement because they had persistent occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery, captopril prevented further ventricular dilatation (P less than 0.05). Patients given captopril also had increased exercise capacity (P less than 0.05). This preliminary study indicates that after anterior myocardial infarction, ventricular enlargement is progressive and that captopril may attenuate this process, reduce filling pressures, and improve exercise tolerance.", 
    "254": "Congestive heart failure is a complex clinical syndrome characterized by a number of neuroendocrine responses. These responses are probably an evolutionary vestige of mechanisms designed to defend volume and maintain circulatory homeostasis. Activation of the sympathetic nervous system and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and the release of vasopressin have been clearly documented in patients with heart failure. Unlike the normal ventricle, the failing ventricle responds to peripheral vasoconstriction and sodium retention with further hemodynamic embarrassment and circulatory congestion. Certain vasorelaxant natriuretic substances are also released during heart failure, perhaps in an attempt to offset excessive peripheral constriction and sodium retention. Prostaglandin E2, atrial natriuretic peptide (or atrial natriuretic factor) and plasma dopamine are found to be increased in some patients with heart failure. However, peripheral constriction and sodium retention appear to be dominant, particularly in the advanced stages of heart failure. An understanding of these neuroendocrine responses has led to new developments in therapy. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have emerged as distinctly useful drugs in the treatment of heart failure. Agents designed to block excessive sympathetic drive and inhibit vasopressin are under investigation. Infusion of atrial natriuretic factors and the use of selective dopamine agonists are also undergoing clinical trials in patients with heart failure. Increased knowledge of the neuroendocrine responses will likely result in even newer and more imaginative therapy.", 
    "255": "The prognosis in patients with heart failure secondary to left ventricular dysfunction is poor. Although survival can be related to the extent of cardiac functional impairment, many patients die suddenly rather than in refractory heart failure. Ambulatory electrocardiography has revealed a high prevalence of simple and complex ventricular arrhythmias in these patients, which was the most important predictor of subsequent mortality in our patients. Factors predisposing to arrhythmias are many, but increased catecholamines and electrolyte abnormalities are among the more obvious. In patients who have undergone treatment for congestive heart failure, serum and total body potassium are reduced, and this is closely and inversely related to the state of activation of the renin-angiotensin system. Renin and noradrenaline are also closely and directly correlated, while both are inversely related to the arterial pressure. Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors tends to reverse these neuroendocrine and electrolyte abnormalities and reduces the frequency of ventricular arrhythmias. Whether this will have a favorable impact on mortality, and, in particular, on sudden death, remains to be seen.", 
    "256": "Benefits from vasodilator therapy in patients with chronic heart failure are partly related to the severity of functional derangements. Agents with an arteriolar-dilating effect are more likely to be effective in patients with higher left ventricular outflow resistance. Vasodilators with primary venodilating properties are more likely to be effective in the presence of an increased ventricular preload. The mechanisms by which preload and left ventricular outflow resistance increase in patients with cardiac insufficiency are not well understood and may not be similar in all patients. Vasodilators also have the capacity to ameliorate myocardial metabolic functional abnormalities by influencing myocardial energetics, but the effects of different agents on coronary hemodynamics may not be uniform. Effects on renal hemodynamics may also vary, as may neurohumoral changes after therapy. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been shown to exert beneficial effects on both coronary and renal hemodynamics in patients with chronic heart failure, while producing favorable neurohumoral changes. These agents provide some advantages over direct-acting vasodilators in that myocardial oxygen consumption is decreased, myocardial metabolic function is improved, and norepinephrine and aldosterone levels are reduced. Further controlled studies are needed to assess the efficacy of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in relation to other vasodilators for the long-term management of these patients.", 
    "257": "A review of the current evidence on the effects of various agents on survival among patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) suggests that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors probably offer the greatest potential for benefit. Trials undertaken before the Cooperative North Scandinavian Enalapril Survival Study (CONSENSUS) revealed favorable trends among patients in New York Heart Association functional classes II to IV who received angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Data from CONSENSUS clearly demonstrate that enalapril reduces mortality rates among patients in New York Heart Association class IV, but conclusions regarding effects in patients with mild or moderate CHF must await the results of future studies. In contrast, the large data base on alpha-adrenergic blockers suggests that these drugs are not likely to improve survival. Information on inotropic agents is sparse, but it is possible that these drugs may not improve survival and, in fact, may have a harmful effect. Mortality data on CHF patients treated with beta blockers and calcium channel blockers are likewise limited; conclusions concerning effects on survival must be postponed until further studies are conducted. Many of the investigations undertaken thus far to examine survival in patients with CHF have been small and of short duration, so any comparisons of the effects of various drugs must be interpreted with caution.", 
    "258": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been found effective in the treatment of congestive heart failure (CHF) and have been recommended as the first choice of vasodilator therapy by some observers. Favorable hemodynamic responses, apparent both at rest and during exercise, result from a considerable reduction in both systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance, apparently due to both the arterial and venodilating effects of these agents. In addition, the recently reported results of the Cooperative North Scandinavian Enalapril Survival Study demonstrate that ACE inhibitors reduce mortality rates in patients with CHF. The etiology of heart failure does not seem to predict clinical response to ACE inhibitors, nor do acute resting and exercise hemodynamic responses. A weak relation has been found between plasma renin activity and short-term hemodynamic and clinical responses, but this association is not evident over the long term. Therefore, a trial of therapy with ACE inhibitors is necessary to judge efficacy in an individual patient with advanced CHF symptoms. Two such agents--captopril and enalapril--are available. The former has a more rapid onset and shorter duration of action, whereas the latter may be given on a twice-daily basis, simplifying chronic therapy.", 
    "259": "The Cooperative North Scandinavian Enalapril Survival Study (CONSENSUS) was terminated prematurely when an independent Ethical Review Committee concluded, on the basis of interim analyses, that continuation would not be advisable on either ethical or scientific grounds. Among 124 patients treated with enalapril and 120 randomized to placebo, 6-month mortality rates were 27 and 48%, respectively. The 2 groups were found to be well balanced with regard to baseline clinical characteristics, and a consistent treatment effect was evident among subgroups. Furthermore, the difference favoring enalapril was found to have been present since the beginning of the study and was consistent over time. Based on these findings, the study was halted on December 14, 1986.", 
    "260": "In a double-blind, randomized trial, 253 patients with heart failure (New York Heart Association functional class IV) received either enalapril (n = 127) or placebo (n = 126) in addition to their conventional therapeutic regimens (digitalis, diuretics and vasodilators other than angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors). Enalapril was administered in a dose of 2.5 to 40 mg/day. The placebo group was administered placebo tablets in addition to their conventional therapeutic regimen. The study was discontinued prematurely for ethical reasons because of the highly significant (p = 0.003) difference in mortality between the enalapril (n = 50) and placebo groups (n = 68). The important reduction was observed among patients dying from progressive heart failure. Follow-up ranged from 1 day to 20 months (average 188 days). The reduction in mortality was associated with general improvements in symptoms and signs of left and right ventricular heart failure, reduction of heart size, improvements in New York Heart Association classification, reduction of concurrent cardiovascular medication, and reduction in the number of hospital admissions and duration of hospitalization. The overall rate of withdrawal from the study was low and was comparable in the 2 treatment groups (16%). Induced hypotension was an intentional part of the treatment, and symptomatic hypotension was observed in 17% of treated patients vs 0% of the placebo group. Hypotension was the reason for withdrawal in 7 patients. After the initial dose of enalapril was reduced to 2.5 mg in high-risk patients, hypotension was the reason for withdrawal in only 3% of all patients. Hyperkalemia was observed exclusively among patients concurrently using potassium-sparing agents.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "261": "To evaluate the influence of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril (2.5 to 40 mg/day), on the prognosis of severe congestive heart failure, defined as New York Heart Association functional class IV, a double-blind study was undertaken in which 253 patients were randomized to receive either placebo (n = 126) or enalapril (n = 127) in addition to conventional treatment, including vasodilators. Follow-up averaged 188 days (range 1 day to 20 months). The reduction in crude mortality within 6 months (primary objective) was 40% in the enalapril-treated group (from 44 to 26%, p = 0.002) and within 1 year 31% (p = 0.001). By the end of the study, 68 subjects in the placebo group and 50 in the enalapril group had died--a reduction of 27% (p = 0.003). The entire reduction in total mortality (50%) was found in patients dying from progressive heart failure, whereas no difference was seen in the incidence of sudden cardiac death. There was a significant improvement in New York Heart Association classification in the enalapril group, together with a reduction in heart size and a reduced requirement for other heart failure medication. It is concluded that the addition of enalapril to conventional therapy in patients with severe congestive heart failure can reduce mortality and improve symptoms. The effect seems to be due to a reduction in death from progression of heart failure.", 
    "262": "Brachial artery mean arterial pressure (MAP), blood flow velocity (BFV), blood flow (BF), and arterial compliance (AC) were measured using pulsed Doppler systems in patients with sustained essential hypertension. The hemodynamic investigation was performed before (T0) and after 3 months (T1) of chronic treatment with the converting enzyme inhibitor Perindopril and after a further month with placebo (T2). Following treatment with Perindopril, BFV, BF, and AC significantly increased while MAP significantly decreased. The changes in AC and BFV were negatively and significantly correlated both between T0 and T1 and between T1 and T2. The study showed that the increase in arterial compliance produced by Perindopril was inversely related to the extent of arteriolar dilatation, indicating that factors other than the blood pressure reduction itself were involved in the brachial artery changes.", 
    "263": "Disposition of pentopril was studied in 15 male volunteers with varying renal functions. Mild to moderate compromise in renal function did not demonstrate any appreciable changes in plasma concentration of pentopril, the prodrug ester of the active angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor CGS 13934. This is consistent with the known elimination pattern for pentopril, which is eliminated primarily by hydrolysis to the active inhibitor. In contrast, the plasma concentration of the active ACE inhibitor was sensitive to moderate changes in renal function. Because of the reciprocal relationship of AUC and clearance, AUC did not change to any appreciable extent until creatinine clearance (CLCR) dropped to about 50 ml/min. Below 50 ml/min of CLCR, AUC and half-life increased sharply with reduced kidney function. Because of the significant contribution of the renal secretion process to total renal elimination of both pentopril and the active metabolite, prediction of renal clearance from CLCR was poor at relatively normal kidney function (CLCR greater than 80 ml/min). However, renal secretory clearances for both pentopril and metabolite were well correlated to p-aminohippuric acid clearance. In patients with moderately compromised renal function (glomerular filtration rate less than 40 ml/min), tubular secretion rate of creatinine approaches its glomerular filtration rate and hence CLCR could be used as a predictor of renal clearance and other disposition parameters. Plasma ACE activity also demonstrated prolonged inhibition with decreased renal function. Based on the prolonged blockade of plasma ACE activity, some correction in dose or dosing interval is anticipated in patients with moderately compromised renal function (CLCR less than 50 ml/min).", 
    "264": "The effect of hypertension and of therapy by converting enzyme inhibitor (S 9490-3, perindopril) on the function and structure of large arteries has been studied in two-kidney, one-clip Goldblatt hypertensive rats. After one month without treatment, clipped hypertensive rats (n = 24) and sham-operated rats (n = 24) were randomly allocated to treatment by S 9490, 1 mg/kg once a day (n = 24) or to placebo (n = 24) and pursued for 4 weeks. Hemodynamic parameters, including instantaneous pressure and aortic velocity measured by D\u00f6ppler, were recorded under anesthesia at the end of the treatment period. Passive mechanical properties of carotid arteries were recorded in situ in the presence or the absence of smooth muscle cell activity (potassium cyanide poisoning). Morphological parameters of the aortic media, including medial thickness, nucleus density, and cross sectional area and relative density in proteins of interstitial matrix, were recorded by an automated morphometrical system. Hypertension was associated with an increase in characteristic impedance of the aorta and a decrease in compliance of the arterial system. Treatment with converting enzyme inhibitors completely reversed these in vivo markers of the rigidity of large arteries. Hypertension was associated with a shift of the passive pressure-volume relation in the carotid. Treatment with converting enzyme inhibitors normalized the carotid pressure-volume relation, whereas poisoning smooth muscle cells induced a disappearance of the curve differences between hypertensive and normotensive animals. Morphometric analysis of aortic walls permits us to report this functional change to structural modification of the arterial wall. Aortic media thickness was increased by hypertension; this phenomenon was reversed by treatment. Modification of aortic thickness was due to hypertrophy of smooth muscle cells with parallel modifications of absolute amount of collagen, whereas absolute amount of elastin did not change in this early phase of renovascular hypertension in young rats. Treatment with converting enzyme inhibitors reversed the thickness of aortic media without regression of the increase in absolute amount of collagen content whereas absolute amount of elastin content did not change.", 
    "265": "The ability of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor Captopril to modify radiation-induced pulmonary endothelial dysfunction was determined in male rats sacrificed 2 months after a single dose of 10-30 Gy of 60Co gamma rays to the right hemithorax. Half of each dose group consumed feed containing 0.12% w/w Captopril (60 mg/kg/day) continuously after irradiation, and half consumed control feed. Four markers of endothelial function were monitored: ACE activity, plasminogen activator (PLA) activity, and prostacyclin (PGI2) and thromboxane (TXA2) production. All data were plotted as dose-response curves, and subjected to linear regression analysis. The Captopril modifying effect was expressed as the ratio of isoeffective doses at a common intermediate response (DRF), or as the ratio of the response curve slopes. Right lung ACE and PLA activity decreased linearly, and PGI2 and TXA2 production increased linearly with increasing radiation dose. Captopril exhibited DRF values of 1.4-2.1, and slope ratios of 1.4-5.1 for all four functional markers (p less than 0.05). Thus, the ACE inhibitor Captopril ameliorates radiation-induced pulmonary endothelial dysfunction in rats sacrificed 2 months postirradiation. Although the mechanism of Captopril action is not clear at present, these data suggest a novel application for this class of compounds as injury-modifying agents in irradiated lung.", 
    "266": "In order to assess the determinants of renal function deterioration induced by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (ACEI) in renovascular hypertension, studies were performed in patients with bilateral stenosis (BS; n = 12) and stenosis of a solitary kidney (SK; n = 10). Acute administration of captopril was associated with a consistent fall in glomerular filtration rate in 5 of 12 patients with BS and 8 of 10 with SK. Overall, glomerular filtration rate decreased by 22 +/- 7%, while mean arterial pressure decreased by only 8 +/- 2% and renal plasma flow remained unaltered. The ACEI-induced change in glomerular filtration rate was unrelated to blood pressure or basal plasma renin activity, but it was inversely related to pre-ACEI filtration fraction. In a comparative study conducted in 6 BS and 4 SK patients, acute administration of nifedipine was associated with a change in glomerular filtration rate of 13 +/- 5% and no change in renal plasma flow, despite a marked decrease in mean arterial pressure of 19 +/- 4%. In contrast, in the same patients, glomerular filtration rate fell by 23 +/- 12%, renal plasma flow did not change and mean arterial pressure fell slightly by 7 +/- 3% after ACEI.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "267": "With the increasing recognition of relatively mild hypertension, asymptomatic patients are being started on life-long therapy with antihypertensive agents. Before the diagnosis is made or therapy instituted, elevated blood pressure must be verified. To provide maximal protection against premature cardiovascular disease and coronary disease, various non-drug therapies should be used that lower both blood pressure and other risk factors. Drugs should be chosen to provide maximal efficacy, long-term safety, and multifaceted convenience, providing the greatest protection with the least interference with quality of life. These goals can be best achieved by substituting commonly used drugs such as diuretics, central agonists, and beta-blockers with vasodilators, such as alpha-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and calcium blockers.", 
    "268": "With the correct selection of drug and patient, the calcium antagonists as a group can be remarkably effective at relatively low cost of serious side effects. Almost all side effects are dose related. Minor side effects include those caused by vasodilation (flushing and headaches), constipation (verapamil), and ankle edema. Serious side effects are rare and result from improper use of these agents, as when intravenous verapamil (or diltiazem) is given to patients with sinus or atrioventricular nodal depression from drugs or disease, or nifedipine to patients with aortic stenosis. The potential of a marked negative inotropic effect is usually offset by afterload reduction, especially in the case of nifedipine which actually has the most marked negative inotropic effect. Yet caution is required when even calcium antagonists, especially verapamil, are given to patients with myocardial failure unless caused by hypertensive heart disease. Drug interactions of calcium antagonists occur with other cardiovascular agents such as alpha-adrenergic blockers, beta-adrenergic blockers, digoxin, quinidine, and disopyramide. The most marked interaction with digoxin is that with verapamil, which may raise digoxin levels by over 50%. Combination therapy of calcium antagonists with beta-blockers is increasingly common, and is probably safest in the case of dihydropyridines. Other combinations being explored are those with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and diuretics.", 
    "269": "The present study investigated the effect of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, captopril, CGS14824A and CGS14831 on in vitro rat aortic and urinary bladder prostacyclin (PGI2; measured as 6-oxo-PGF1 alpha by radioimmunoassay) synthesis. PGI2 synthesis was stimulated with adrenaline (aorta), carbachol (bladder), calcium ionophore A23187, arachidonate and trauma. The ACE inhibitors antagonised adrenaline-, carbachol- and A23187-stimulated PGI2 synthesis in the aorta and bladder (CGS14824A greater than captopril greater than CGS14831) but were without effect on trauma- or arachidonate-stimulated PGI2 synthesis. The patterns of inhibition of these ACE inhibitors, using the same stimulatory regimes, was very similar to those previously observed by us with known calcium channel blockers (nifedipine, verapamil). These data suggest that: (i) ACE inhibitors possess calcium channel blocking properties, which may be of relevance to the antihypertensive action of these drugs; and (ii) ACE inhibitors did not stimulate vascular PGI2 synthesis as has been previously suggested.", 
    "270": "Forty-one patients, presenting in the Emergency Service of the Hospital General y Clinico, Tenerife, with symptoms of hypertensive crisis and supine diastolic blood pressure (DBP) greater than 120 mm Hg, were studied. They received 12.5 mg of sublingual captopril and 30 minutes later, if diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was not 100 mm Hg or less, the same dose was repeated by the same route. Supine systolic blood pressure (SBP), DBP and heart rate (HR) were monitored at 0, 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, and 120 minutes after each administration of captopril. In 27 patients (66%) had a satisfactory response (DBP less than or equal to 100 mm Hg), after a single dose, less than 30 minutes after administration, which persisted at 120 minutes. In 14, a second administration was necessary after 30 minutes, and a satisfactory response to the second dose, defined again as DBP reaching values of 100 mm Hg or less, was achieved in 12 of them (29% of the total group). In two patients (5% of total) no full response was obtained. The observed pattern of response suggests that a sublingual dose of 25 mg of captopril is the minimum effective dose, but it is also possible that administration of 12.5 mg of sublingual captopril at 10 to 15 minute intervals, perhaps up to a maximum dose of 37.5 mg, might be considered as an alternative treatment in hypertensive crises.", 
    "271": "Hypogeusia is a reported side effect of captopril. Linkage of hypogeusia to zinc deficiency has been suggested. We objectively assessed taste acuity using Henkin's three-drop stimulus technique and measured plasma zinc (PZn) level and urinary zinc excretion in 31 hypertensive patients. Of these, 11 were long-term, high-dose captopril recipients (more than 6 months, 266 +/- 34 mg/day), six were short-term captopril recipients (less than 6 months, 104 +/- 40 mg/daily dose), and the remaining 14 served as noncaptopril controls. Compared to controls, the long-term captopril group had significantly higher taste detection and recognition thresholds, lower PZn (91 +/- 3 vs. 100 +/- 3 micrograms/dl, P less than 0.05) and higher urinary zinc excretion (1017 +/- 89 vs. 609 +/- 76 micrograms/day, P less than 0.005). The short-term captopril group did not differ significantly from the noncaptopril group except for higher taste-recognition thresholds for NaCl and sucrose (P less than 0.05). Discontinuing captopril improved taste acuity and almost normalized zinc parameters in two patients on long-term captopril. These results suggest that abnormalities of taste are commonly associated with captopril therapy and may be related to changes in zinc metabolism. This is especially true in patients on long-term, high-dose captopril therapy.", 
    "272": "The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy (lowering diastolic blood pressure to 90 mm Hg or less) of urapidil, a postsynaptic alpha-blocker with central action with that of captopril in a randomized, double-blind, multicenter study. Two hundred ninety-five essential hypertensives (WHO I/II) (140 male, 155 female, age 56-60 years) were treated for 12 weeks with either 30 to 90 mg urapidil bid or 12.5 to 50 mg captopril bid. Supine blood pressure values (mmHg, mean +/- SD) at the end of the 12-week treatment dropped for the urapidil group (n = 142) from 175/103 +/- 19/6 to 154/89 +/- 17/9 (P less than 0.001), and in the captopril group (n = 153) from 175/103 +/- 19/6 to 154/90 +/- 19/9 (P less than 0.001), corresponding to 62% urapidil and 58% captopril responder rates. The results demonstrate that the two antihypertensive medications with different modes of action control blood pressure with equal efficacy at three dose levels. A dose decrease was possible in 20% of each group, but a dose increase was necessary in 39% of urapidil and 44% of captopril group.",

All antihypertensive drugs were discontinued and patients then received placebo for 2 weeks. Twenty-two patients, mean age 59.1 +/- 14.3 years, with sitting diastolic blood pressure (BP) 92 to 110 mm Hg, entered the 6-week active-drug phase. Eleven patients (Group A) were randomized to Capozide 25/15 and 11 (Group B) to Capozide 50/15. Baseline mean BPs were 151.0/100.7 mm Hg in Group A and 153.1/100.7 mm Hg in Group B. At week 6, mean BPs were 128.7/84.4 mm Hg in Group A and 126.8/82.7 mm Hg in Group B. Uric acid, blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels rose slightly in both groups. There were no adverse events. Eighteen patients had normal BPs at study completion. Twice-daily Capozide treatment is effective and well tolerated in blacks; patients responded equally well to both doses.", 
    "274": "The effects on serum lipids of substituting captopril for other antihypertensive drugs were evaluated in 24 essential hypertensives with stable hypercholesterolemia (total cholesterol 250 to 350 mg/dL). Captopril, 50 mg bid, was substituted for one of the nondiuretic drugs the patients were already taking. Patients on a diuretic continued the same diuretic at the same dosage. After 6 months of treatment including captopril, patients returned for 3 months to their previous therapeutic scheme (rechallenge). Treatment with captopril caused a reduction in total cholesterol (-18%) and triglycerides (-26%) and an increase in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (+27%). When patients returned to their precaptopril therapy, total and HDL cholesterol returned to precaptopril values. These effects of captopril on lipid profile of hypertensive patients with hypercholesterolemia could be important for the reduction of cardiovascular complications in treated hypertensives.", 
    "275": "The long-term antihypertensive response to captopril (25-50 mg/day) and 75g oral glucose tolerance (75g oGTT) following a 6-10 month period of captopril administration was evaluated in 20 patients with essential hypertension without persistent proteinuria. Eleven of these 20 patients exhibited impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), while the remaining nine patients had normal glucose tolerance (NGT). All patients tolerated long-term captopril therapy with no untoward effects. Six months' administration of captopril significantly decreased blood pressure in patients with NGT from 171 +/- 12/105 +/- 5 mm Hg (mean +/- SE) to 146 +/- 7/88 +/- 4 mm Hg. Also in patients with IGT, long-term captopril therapy decreased blood pressure from 165 +/- 3/97 +/- 2 to 143 +/- 5/86 +/- 2 mm Hg. No patient with NGT developed diabetes mellitus. Neither fasting nor post-glucose-load venous blood glucose deteriorated in any of the patients during the therapy. There were no significant changes in the insulinogenic index (delta IRI/delta BG at 30 minutes after glucose load) in both the patients with NGT and IGT. In patients with IGT, the concentration of glycosylated hemoglobin (Hb A1 and Hb A1c slightly but significantly decreased from 8.1 +/- 0.3 to 7.7 +/- 0.4% (P less than 0.05) and from 5.9 +/- 0.3 to 5.5 +/- 0.3% (P less than 0.01) after 6.2 +/- 1.4 months' captopril therapy. These results suggest that in addition to its antihypertensive effects, long-term captopril therapy does not compromise glucose metabolism in hypertensive patients.", 
    "276": "Previous studies have shown that atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) inhibits renin secretion whereas cilazapril blocks angiotensin II generation via converting enzyme inhibition. Both agents enhance renal excretory function. The present study was conducted to test whether the renin-angiotension system is involved in the ANF-induced renal effects. ANF was administered to anesthetized normal rats (n = 16) with or without a simultaneous infusion of cilazapril. Single bolus injections of ANF at doses of 2.5 micrograms/kg and 5.0 micrograms/kg significantly decreased mean arterial blood pressure by 6.8 +/- 2.3% and 9.4 +/- 2.2%, respectively. The corresponding increases in glomerular filtration rate were 5.6 +/- 3.7% and 8.4 +/- 2.8%, in absolute sodium excretion were 55.0 +/- 18.5% and 105.2 +/- 39.9%, and in urine flow were 24.8 +/- 9.3% and 35.6 +/- 14.6%. Intravenous infusion of cilazapril (33 micrograms/kg.min) reduced the arterial blood pressure, elevated the glomerular filtration rate and increased sodium and water excretion. The corresponding doses of ANF administration during continuous infusion of cilazapril further decreased blood pressure by 8.3 +/- 1.9% and 10.9 +/- 5.4%, respectively. However, there were no significant changes in the glomerular filtration rate and sodium and water excretion. The failure of ANF to exhibit a renal effect was irrelevant to the lowering blood pressure induced by cilazapril. These results suggest that reduced endogenous angiotensin II generation contributes to the renal, but not the hypotensive, effect of ANF.", 
    "277": "This study assesses the magnitude and duration of action of three different oral doses of the new orally active angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor RO 312848 (cilazapril, Hoffman-LaRoche, Nutley, NJ) on blood pressure and plasma ACE levels. Twelve hypertensive patients were separated into two groups: Group A (n = 6) received two single daily doses of 5 and 10 mg, each preceded and followed by two placebo days, and Group B (n = 6) received 10 and 20 mg on an identical protocol. The onset and duration of an appreciable blood pressure lowering effects were at 2 hours and at least for 12 hours, respectively, whereas suppression of ACE levels occurred at 1 hour and lasted for more than 72 hours. Response of these two parameters was partial after 5 mg, but was maximal after 10 mg and did not increase further with the 20-mg dose. A 5-10 mg dose daily may be sufficient to maintain chronic blood pressure control with this agent, but long-term dose trials are necessary to establish its clinical utility.", 
    "278": "Cilazapril (CIL), a new angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, was evaluated for 16 weeks in 29 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension (diastolic pressure 95 mm Hg to 115 mm Hg). Twenty-four patients (83%) normalized their blood pressure (BP) (diastolic pressure less than 90 mm Hg), 11 with low-dose CIL, six with high-dose CIL, one with high-dose CIL plus low-dose thiazide, and six with high-dose CIL and high-dose thiazide. Three withdrew because of side effects (fatigue, bloating, and polyuria). Statistically significant reductions in sitting and standing systolic and diastolic pressures occurred at 8 and 16 weeks on CIL. There was no change in standing or sitting heart rate, white blood cell count, creatinine clearance, urine protein levels. This is the first long-term data on this new converting enzyme inhibitor in human beings.", 
    "279": "Fosenopril, a new angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, is a prodrug that is converted to its active diacid metabolite after intestinal absorption. Its excretion is equally divided between hepatic and renal routes. This study details the efficacy of fosenopril at rest and during exercise on blood pressure, plasma potassium, plasma renin activity, and plasma aldosterone in 11 hypertensive males, mean age 55 years. Individual subjects underwent an identical exercise protocol (bicycle ergometry) on placebo and on active treatment. Supine mean blood pressure fell from 116 to 100 mm Hg, P less than 0.005, and at 9 minutes of exercise mean blood pressure fell from 137 to 125 mm Hg, P less than 0.01 on fosenopril. Plasma potassium fell slightly at rest from 4.27 to 3.96 mmol/L and during exercise from 5.23 to 4.93 mmol/L, both P less than 0.025. Plasma renin activity (ng/mL/hr) rose on fosenopril, at rest 0.94 to 4.72, and during exercise 2.06 to 10.39, both P less than 0.005. Aldosterone changes on treatment were marginal and nonsignificant. The compound was well tolerated and free of subjective and routine laboratory side effects. Its antihypertensive action is broadly similar to the other ACE inhibitors currently available.", 
    "280": "The pharmacokinetic properties and antihypertensive effects of cilazapril, a long-acting angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, were investigated in five patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension (mean age 57 years, mean serum creatinine 1.2 mg/dL, mean glomerular filtration rate 69 mL/min/1.73m2, mean blood pressure 158/94 mm Hg). All patients were hospitalized and placed on a constant sodium diet (7 g of NaCl/day) throughout the study. After an overnight fast, a 1.25-mg dose of cilazapril was given orally once a day for 5 or 8 days. On the first and last days of treatment, blood samples were taken and blood pressure was measured. All patients tolerated cilazapril with no untoward effects. Cilazapril induced a significant decrease in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and its antihypertensive effect was still present 24 hours after administration. Serum ACE activity was markedly suppressed for at least 24 hours. The peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) of cilazapril and its diacid were 117 and 24.6 ng/mL on the first treatment day, and 144 and 31.1 ng/mL on the last day. The area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) of cilazapril and its diacid were 408 and 227 ng.h/mL on the first day, and 501 and 305 ng.h/mL on the last day. In looking at the data gathered on the first and last treatment days, no significant differences were noted in Cmax and AUC values. These results suggest that cilazapril has a long-lasting effect and is a useful antihypertensive agent in controlling blood pressure in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension.", 
    "281": "The failure of clinical trials in the treatment of hypertension to show protection against mortality from coronary heart disease has prompted a major reconsideration of the indications and modes of therapy. One area of concern is the lipid disturbances seen with diuretics and non-ISA (intrinsic sympathomimetic activity) beta blockers; another is the negative inotropic effect of beta blockers. The more widespread use of vasodilators--either alpha-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, or calcium channel blockers--therefore seems appropriate. Among the calcium channel blockers, nicardipine appears to be a particularly attractive choice, in part because of its lack of negative inotropism.", 
    "282": "The antihypertensive effects of once-daily administration of celiprolol 400 mg were compared with those of once-daily enalapril 20 mg in 20 mild to moderate essential hypertensives in a single-blind study in which the subjects were randomized to 2 weeks' treatment with either drug, preceded by 2 weeks of placebo administration. Supine and standing systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic pressure (DBP), and heart rate (HR) were measured at rest and during exercise (exercise bicycle with increasing work loads up to 100 watts) at the end of either period, 20 to 24 hr after drug or placebo administration. Compared to placebo, both celiprolol and enalapril reduced resting supine and standing SBP and DBP to a marked and similar extent; resting HR was unaffected by enalapril, while celiprolol produced modest reductions. During exercise, however, celiprolol significantly attenuated rises in SBP and HR, while enalapril did not. Indexes of cardiac function at rest obtained by echocardiography and systolic time intervals were unaffected by either drug. Thus, despite similar reductions by both drugs in resting blood pressures, celiprolol produced better antihypertensive effects during exercise than enalapril.", 
    "283": "We measured plasma renin activity and plasma catecholamines in 26 untreated patients with phaeochromocytoma, 18 untreated patients with primary hypertension, and 10 normal control volunteers. Plasma renin activity measured in patients in the supine position, standing position and after walking for 1 h was higher in the subjects with phaeochromocytoma than in those with primary hypertension or in the volunteers (F = 9, P less than 0.001). In all three situations, renin activity was closely correlated with noradrenaline levels in the phaeochromocytoma patients (r = 0.545, r = 0.600, and r = 0.739; P less than 0.01) but not in the subjects with primary hypertension or in the volunteers. The cardioselective beta-blocker acebutolol reduced heart rate, mean blood pressure and renin activity by averages of 20, 12 and 89% respectively in the seven phaeochromocytoma patients given the drug. Captopril decreased mean blood pressure by 19% and raised renin activity by 293% in the nine phaeochromocytoma patients tested. These findings show that in phaeochromocytoma, hypertension is accompanied by high renin levels and that renin release is stimulated in response to noradrenaline overflow. The hypotension observed in response to beta-blockade and captopril provides indirect support for the possibility that renin-dependent mechanisms are involved in the hypertension of phaeochromocytoma.", 
    "284": "The most common mild side effects occurring with use of beta-blockers, thiazide diuretics, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors for blood pressure control are central nervous system symptoms, specifically lethargy, sedation, and fatigue. These symptoms affect 5% to 10% of patients taking these drugs. The mechanism by which beta-blockers may induce central nervous system effects is uncertain. Relative lipophilicity as a factor affecting penetrance of the blood-brain barrier has not proved to be a reliable predictor of whether the drug will cause such disturbances. Comparisons of atenolol (hydrophilic) and metoprolol (lipophilic) have shown no differences between these drugs with respect to side effects of the central nervous system. The incidence of central nervous system effects with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors is similar to that for most beta-blockers. The precise role of the angiotensin-converting enzyme in the central nervous system is not well defined. Most thiazide diuretics are not associated with major complications of the central nervous system, although electrolyte imbalance may occasionally lead to complaints of neurologic symptoms. Because the incidence of central nervous system effects with these three classes of drugs is so low, concern for the side effects of the central nervous system is not a prime consideration in the choice of an initial antihypertensive agent.", 
    "285": "To examine the modulatory role of angiotensin II on the tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) mechanism, TGF responses were assessed during control conditions, converting enzyme inhibition (CEI; MK 422, 0.6 mg/kg.hr) and during continued CEI with the replacement of angiotensin II. TGF responses were assessed from stop flow pressure (SFP) feedback responses obtained during step increases in the late proximal perfusion rate from 0-40 nl/min. SFP values in the absence of perfusion were used to estimate glomerular pressure (GP) under conditions where the influence of the TGF mechanism should be at a minimum. During CEI, the arterial pressure decreased from 124 +/- 3 to 106 +/- 3 mmHg and the estimated GP decreased from 53 +/- 1.4 to 49 +/- 0.8 mmHg. There was a marked attenuation in the magnitude of SFP feedback responses from 11.0 +/- 1.3 to 2.7 +/- 0.6 mmHg. TGF feedback responses, however, were restored towards normal during superimposed angiotensin II infusion (7.7 +/- 0.9 mmHg). These results indicate that converting enzyme inhibition decreases the effects of angiotensin II on the kidney through TGF dependent mechanism.", 
    "286": "The effects of a mid-term antihypertensive treatment with Acebutolol (A) 400 mg once-daily alone, Enalapril (E) 20 mg once-daily alone and their combination (A + E) in 12 hypertensive patients (pts.) have been evaluated. The diastolic (DBP) and systolic (SBP) blood pressure values have been evaluated in supine and upright position and at the end of an exercise test. Basic values obtained after 3 weeks of treatment with placebo have been matched with values observed after 3 months of each treatment (A; A + E; E). In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the combination, pts. were divided into two groups: the first group was given A, than A + E and finally E; in the second group the order was reversed. Our findings showed a more significant reduction of DBP in supine and upright position and after exercise (p less than .05) and of SBP in supine and upright position (p less than .05) after treatment with E. The addition of A to E did not produce a further significant reduction in blood pressure values except after exercise (p less than .01).", 
    "287": "The effect of a new orally active angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, calcium(-)-N-[(S)-3-[(N-cyclohexyl-carbonyl-D-alanyl)thio]-2-methyl- prolinate (MC-838, altiopril calcium), on cardiohemodynamics and tissue ACE activity was compared with that of captopril in the anesthetized miniature pig. MC-838 and captopril were infused i.v. for 1 or 3 hr at an equimolar rate of 20 and 10 micrograms/kg.hr-1, respectively. When MC-838 was infused i.v., captopril appeared in approximately 40% of MC-838 in serum, indicating that the amount of serum captopril during the equimolar concentration treatment with MC-838 corresponds to half of serum captopril after the dosing of captopril. During the infusion, the drugs did not significantly affect systemic blood pressure (SBP), heart rate (HR), renal blood flow (RBF) and renal vascular resistance (RVR). MC-838 and captopril, in a similar degree, attenuated the vasoconstrictor response to angiotensin-I (A-I) injected into the renal artery (i.a.), and enhanced the vasodilator one to i.a. bradykinin, 3 hr after the onset of the drug infusion. The animals were sacrificed at 1 and 3 hr after the onset of the infusion of MC-838 or captopril, and the ACE activity in serum and some target organs (lung, kidney, heart, brain and aorta) was determined. Effective activities of MC-838 and captopril occurred in the lung and kidney (only at 3 hr for captopril) where higher ACE activity in a variety of tissues was found, to a lesser degree in the serum (only by captopril) and not at all in the brain, heart and aorta.", 
    "288": "The antihypertensive activity of a new angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, CV-5975, (R)-3-[(S)-1-carboxy-5-(4-piperidyl)pentyl] amino-4-oxo-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1,5-benzothiazepine-5-acetic acid, was examined in normotensive rats and various hypertensive animal models. In spontaneously hypertensive rats, CV-5975 (1 to 10 mg/kg, p.o.) had a dose-related, sustained antihypertensive action, which was more potent and longer than that of enalapril. The potency and duration of action of CV-5975 was intensified when it was administered repeatedly or combined with hydrochlorothiazide. CV-5975 (1 mg/kg, p.o.) inhibited the ACE activity of plasma and tissues; inhibition on the ACE activity of the aorta, kidney, and brain was marked when CV-5975 was administered repeatedly. In 2-kidney, 1 clip hypertensive rats (1 to 10 mg/kg, p.o.) and dogs (0.3 and 1 mg/kg, p.o.), CV-5975 had a marked, sustained antihypertensive action, which was more marked than that of enalapril. In normotensive rats (10 mg/kg), 1-kidney, 1 clip hypertensive rats (3 and 10 mg/kg), and hyporeninemic DOCA/salt hypertensive rats (1 to 10 mg/kg/day), CV-5975 administered orally once or repeatedly reduced blood pressure, whereas enalapril did not. These results indicate that CV-5975 is a potent and long-lasting antihypertensive agent, the action of which is mediated primarily by inhibiting ACE activity and partly by some unknown mechanisms.", 
    "289": "Angiotensin converting enzyme [EC 3.4.15.1] was shown to exist in two distinct forms in bovine seminal plasma. The higher molecular weight form of the enzyme (angiotensin convering enzyme I) was purified to homogeneity by Sephadex G-200 gel filtration, and DEAE-Sepharose, blue Sepharose, and concanavalin A-Sepharose column chromatography. Final recovery of the enzyme was 9.0. The molecular weight of the enzyme was estimated to be 8 x 10(5) by the gel filtration method. A value of 4.6 x 10(5) was obtained for the reduced and denatured enzyme by dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The Stokes' radius, diffusion coefficient, and intrinsic viscosity of the purified enzyme were determined to be 95 A, 2.3 x 10(-7) cm2/s, and 6.76 ml/g. The enzyme had a specific activity of 105.12 mumol/min/mg protein for hippurylhistidylleucine. The Km value for hippurylhistidylleucine was found to be 20 mM. Studies with EDTA suggest that metal ions which are tightly bound are required for its activity. The enzyme was inhibited by some heavy metal ions but did not required sulfhydryl groups for its activity. Trypsin treatment of the urea-denatured enzyme produced a catalytically active fragment with an Mr of 30,000. Chemical hydrolysis of the native enzyme did not produce any active fragment.", 
    "290": "The results of large epidemiological studies dealing with the prognosis and unfavourable outcome of essential hypertension, clearly show that the pharmacological reduction of the elevated blood pressure of hypertensive patients significantly reduces the risk of at least some major cardiovascular complications. Satisfactory antihypertensive efficacy reflects, nevertheless, merely a minimal requirement for a modern antihypertensive drug. Additional pharmacological properties, which counteract the typical concomitant diseases like CHD, heart failure and other cardiovascular complications would be desirable. In this respect, the oral CE-inhibitors captopril and enalapril offer an exciting new approach to the treatment of arterial hypertension. As the most predictive international studies on prevention of hypertension were conducted before CE-inhibitors were available, the present review evaluates the pharmacological profile of this new class of antihypertensive compounds in the light of previously available baseline drugs, including the calcium channel antagonists. Until now, captopril and enalapril have been the best investigated and documented representatives. Besides new experimental results concerning the molecular mechanism of these drugs, clinical and experimental approaches to verify protective effects on the cardiovascular and the renal system are addressed. These offer a rational basis for the preferential treatment of hypertensive patients with reduced renal function, diabetes and chronic heart failure. In addition, some distinct advantages of enalapril over captopril, resulting mainly from the long-term reduction of high blood pressure, are discussed.", 
    "291": "The effects of a 6 h infusion of 50 ng/kg.min angiotensin I on hemodynamic parameters were recorded in conscious male beagle dogs. Mean arterial pressure was elevated from 107 +/- 3 mmHg to 152 +/- 5 mmHg (mean +/- SEM, n = 5) within the first hour, followed by a slow decrease to 145 +/- 5 mmHg after 6 h. Cardiac output fell from 2.3 +/- 0.2 l/min to 1.6 +/- 0.2 l/min followed by an increase to 2.5 +/- 0.3 l/min. The peripheral resistance showed an exceeding increase from 2.9 +/- 0.2 mmHg.s/ml to 5.7 +/- 0.7 mmHg.s/ml and a slow decrease to 3.5 +/- 0.5 mmHg.s/ml. Heart rate was found to be decreased from 62 +/- 7 min-1 to 58 +/- 7 min-1 after 1 h. The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitor enalapril caused a complete reduction of the angiotensin induced hypertension. Three new non-sulfhydryl containing ACE-inhibitors ((S)-N-[N-[1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl]-L-alanyl]-N- [1-pyrrolidinyl]-glycine (REV 6207), (S)-N-[N-[1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl]-L-alanyl]-N- [2-ethoxyethoxy]-glycine (REV 6134), (S)-N-[N-[1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylporpyl]-L-alanyl]-N- [phenylmethyl]-glycine (REV 5975] were found to show a partial reduction of the angiotensin I effect. The duration of action which was found to be similar after oral and intravenous administration ranged from 83 +/- 33 min (n = 3) for REV 5975 to more than 360 min for enalapril. A correlation of the arterial pressure lowering and the percentage of the ACE-inhibition suggests that a considerable blood pressure effect can only be observed when more than about 80% of the ACE-activity is inhibited.", 
    "292": "Despite the potential utility of endothelial metabolic substrates for the early clinical detection of acute lung injury, the relationship between lung capillary injury and pulmonary endothelial metabolic function remains incompletely understood. Previous studies have shown that lung capillaries are damaged by oxygen toxicity in the sheep; however, metabolic functions of the pulmonary endothelium have not been examined in this otherwise well-characterized animal model of lung injury. Therefore, we studied the activity of pulmonary endothelial angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in five unanesthetized adult sheep that breathed 100% O2 via tracheostomy for 3 days and in four other sheep that breathed compressed air. In contrast to the sheep that breathed air, the sheep that breathed O2 developed substantial arterial hypoxemia and hypercapnia, an increased alveolar-to-arterial O2 gradient and a slight respiratory acidosis. Morphological examination of lungs from sheep that breathed O2 revealed a multifocal distribution of injury, including interstitial edema, capillary endothelial damage, and alveolar epithelial damage. Indicator-dilution methods were used to assess first-pass pulmonary metabolism of the ACE substrate [3H]Benzoyl-Phe-Ala-Pro (BPAP) and the apparent kinetics (KM and Vmax) of ACE activity. Pulmonary metabolism of BPAP exhibited saturability, was reduced by an ACE inhibitor (enalaprit), and did not result from the activity of circulating plasma ACE. There was no difference between the 2 groups of sheep in the percent metabolism of either 0.1 mumol BPAP/kg or 1.0 mumol BPAP/kg or in the KM of BPAP metabolism. In both groups, the Vmax and Vmax/KM decreased as a result of reductions in cardiac output and volume distribution.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "293": "The purpose of the present study was to investigate the mechanisms of the hypotensive actions of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor of the hypotensive actions of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (captopril) in hypertension. In perfused mesenteric vasculatures from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR, Okamoto and Aoki strain, 10-13 weeks of age) and age-matched normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY), the effects of captopril on vascular responsiveness and norepinephrine release from the adrenergic nerve endings were examined. The vasoconstrictor responses and norepinephrine release during the electrical nerve stimulation were significantly enhanced in SHR compared to those in age-matched WKY. Captopril reduced both vasoconstrictor responses and norepinephrine release during the electrical nerve stimulation, dose-dependently. These inhibitory effects of captopril were significantly greater in SHR than in WKY. The results demonstrate that captopril affects presynaptic sites on the resistance vessels and causes a decrease in electrically-stimulated norepinephrine release from the adrenergic nerve endings. The marked reduction of both pressor responses and norepinephrine release by captopril in SHR suggests an enhanced renin-angiotensin system in the vascular walls of hypertension.", 
    "294": "Previous studies have documented potentially adverse effects of diuretics and beta-blocking agents on plasma lipid profiles. This study was designed to establish the effects on lipid profiles of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors lisinopril and enalapril, alone and in combination with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), the calcium-channel blocker nitrendipine, HCTZ, and hydralazine. After a two-week, single-blind, placebo phase, 77 patients with essential hypertension were given active agent as monotherapy in a double-blind fashion for 8-20 weeks. The dose of each agent was titrated to achieve diastolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg. At the end of placebo and treatment phases, plasma was analyzed for triglycerides, total cholesterol, and high-(HDL), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Overall, few changes in lipid contents were noted. Total cholesterol decreased during therapy with hydralazine but increased in patients receiving the combination of lisinopril and HCTZ. HDL cholesterol was depressed in those taking HCTZ alone and in combination with lisinopril. LDL cholesterol was lowered during therapy with hydralazine but was otherwise unaffected by all other agents. None of the agents evaluated significantly affected triglyceride concentrations. Thus, monotherapy with lisinopril, enalapril, and nitrendipine do not affect plasma lipid concentrations. Hydralazine lowers total and LDL cholesterol. If these findings are confirmed in trials with larger numbers of patients, these effects on lipid profiles may influence choice of agent in the therapy of essential hypertension.", 
    "295": "We evaluated the acute blood pressure lowering effect of enalapril in terms of dose-response curve and compared this effect with that on humoral parameters. Eleven renovascular patients with acute angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition received (according to a randomized double-blind cross-over design) placebo, 10, 20, and 40 mg of enalapril with a 72-hour interval between each dose. Seated blood pressure and heart rate were measured every hour for 6 hours and then again at the twelfth and twenty-fourth hour, while venous blood samples for plasma renin activity, plasma aldosterone and serum ACE measurements were obtained at the fourth and twenty-fourth hour after receiving the placebo or drug. Blood pressure was significantly reduced by all three doses of enalapril at hour 4, while at hour 24 it was reduced only by the 20- and 40-mg doses. A significant correlation (r = 0.68; P less than 0.001) was found between percentage decrements of mean blood pressure and the log of the doses at hour 4 with a similar (although not significant) trend at hour 24. Plasma renin activity was significantly and to a similar extent increased by the three doses of enalapril at hour 4, while at hour 24 it was significantly increased only by the 40-mg dose. Serum ACE and plasma aldosterone were significantly reduced both at hours 4 and 24 without any difference between doses.

The diastolic blood pressure loads (percentages of ambulatory diastolic blood pressures more than 90 mm Hg) during 24 hours and during awake hours were 74% +/- 19% and 83% +/- 15%, respectively, at baseline and 24% +/- 19% (P less than 0.0001) and 29% +/- 21% (P less than 0.0001), respectively, during treatment. Heart rate was not altered by lisinopril. In conclusion, lisinopril is an effective antihypertensive agent for the treatment of moderate hypertension, and ambulatory blood pressures and diastolic blood pressure loads are useful for evaluating therapy for hypertension.", 
    "297": "The pharmacokinetic properties and antihypertensive effects of cilazapril, a long-acting converting enzyme inhibitor, were investigated in seven hypertensive patients with renal failure. Cilazapril 1.25 mg was given orally once a day for 5 or 8 days. Cilazapril induced a significant decrease in both systolic and diastolic blood pressures, and its antihypertensive effect was still present 24 hours after administration. Serum-converting enzyme activity was markedly suppressed for at least 24 hours. No significant differences were noted in plasma peak level and the area under the curve between the first and last days of treatment. These results suggest that cilazapril has a long-lasting effect and is a useful antihypertensive agent in controlling blood pressure in hypertensive patients with renal failure.", 
    "298": "Enalapril was given once daily in low dose (5 to 10 mg) and high dose (20 to 40 mg) in 25 (15 white and 10 black) mild-to-moderate essential hypertensive patients. The white patients had a significant (p less than 0.005) supine diastolic blood pressure (SDBP) lowering with all doses of enalapril (from 97.2 +/- 1.8 to 85 +/- 2.4 mm Hg lowest). The black patient's SDBP did not decrease significantly (100.8 +/- 2.4 to 96.2 +/- 3.7 mm Hg lowest) with enalapril but addition of hydrochlorothiazide achieved satisfactory SDBP control. It is concluded that hydrochlorothiazide should be added if greater than 10 mg/day of enalapril is needed in white patients and the initial therapy in black patients should be a combination of enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide.", 
    "299": "Systemic and renal hemodynamics were studied by invasive and noninvasive techniques in 30 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension before and after antihypertensive therapy with captopril (12 patients), enalapril (8 patients), and lisinopril (10 patients). All three angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduced arterial pressure to about the same extent: captopril by 14%, enalapril by 18%, and lisinopril by 13%. However, lisinopril produced a significant fall (14%, P less than 0.001) in cardiac output that was not seen with captopril or enalapril therapy. Moreover, lisinopril elicited an increase in renal blood flow (22%, P less than 0.05) that was more marked than that with enalapril (12%) or captopril (4%). Although left ventricular mass was reduced (P less than 0.05) with all three agents, enalapril induced a twofold greater reduction (29%) than captopril (14%) or lisinopril (12%). These findings suggest that systemic and renal hemodynamic effects may be drug specific and not uniform for all ACE inhibitors.", 
    "300": "The effects of exposing rats to hypoxia (10% O2) at normal atmospheric pressure for periods of 14 or 28 days on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity and stores of angiotensin I (ANG I) and angiotensin II (ANG II) in lung, kidney, brain, and testis were examined. ACE activity was measured by spectrophotometric assay, and active sites of ACE were estimated by measuring the binding of 125I-351A [N-(1-carbonyl-3-phenyl-propyl)-L-lysyl-L-proline], a highly specific active site-directed inhibitor of ACE, to tissue homogenates and perfused lungs. Hypoxia exposure produced progressive reductions in ACE activity in lung homogenates and in ACE inhibitor binding to perfused lungs. ANG II levels in lungs from hypoxia-adapted animals were significantly less than air controls, suggesting that the reduction in intrapulmonary ACE activity was associated with reduced local generation of ANG II. ACE activity was increased in kidney and unchanged in brain and testis of hypoxia-adapted rats compared with air controls. Thus the effects of chronic hypoxia on catalytically active ACE and ACE active sites in the intact animal were organ specific. Adaptation to chronic hypoxia did not significantly alter plasma renin activity or ANG I or ANG II levels or serum ACE content. The hypoxia-induced alterations in lung and kidney ACE were reversible after return to a normoxic environment.", 
    "301": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) was characterized by radioligand studies utilizing the potent ACE inhibitor 351A, a derivative of lisinopril. Ligand binding characteristics were similar for ACE derived from testis, lung, and kidney, despite known differences in structure between ACe from these sources. This observation suggests that the ACE active enzymatic site is similar in different tissues. The effect of the orally active ACE inhibitor perindopril was studied ex vivo in tissues of the rat after oral gavage. Radioligand bound to tissue ACE was reduced after perindopril treatment, in tissue homogenates of lung and kidney, but not testis. Autoradiographs of radioligand binding to tissue sections obtained ex vivo after oral perindopril showed inhibition of ACE in the aorta, lung, and kidney, but did not reveal any inhibition of ACE in the testis. ACE in small vessels of the testis was inhibited as in the aorta, while at the same time testicular ACE was unaffected. ACE in rat testis appears to have a similar enzymatic binding site to ACE from the lung and kidney. Perindopril inhibited ACE in the lung and kidney but did not affect ACE in the testis, suggesting the drug is limited in testicular penetration by the blood-testis barrier. This may explain the lack of any reports of adverse effects of ACE inhibitors on testicular function.", 
    "302": "Two angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, trandolapril and enalapril, were compared for their effects on rat food-pad oedema induced by carrageenin, bradykinin, dextran and platelet activating factor (PAF). Trandolapril (0.03-30.0 mg/kg, per os) potentiated carrageenin-induced oedemas. Enalapril produced the same effect at 3-10 fold higher doses (0.3-30.0 mg/kg per os). Both ACE inhibitors were equiactive in potentiating bradykinin-induced oedema. Neither compound affected dextran-induced oedema. In marked contrast PAF-induced oedema was reduced by both ACE inhibitors, trandolapril being approximately 10 fold more active than enalapril. The observed differences in potency between the two ACE inhibitors corresponded with their previously described actions on inhibition of plasma and tissue ACE and in inducing hypotension. The results suggest a crucial role of kinins in the oedemagenic response to carrageenin. The reason why the ACE inhibitors reduced PAF-induced oedema is not clear, but could involve peripheral vasodilation.", 
    "303": "Fourteen patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension were randomized, after a baseline placebo period of 4 weeks, to receive the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor quinapril or a placebo. During a 12 week, double-blind phase, the dosage of quinapril was increased from 10 to 40 mg twice daily being doubled every 4 weeks. At the end of the baseline period and of each month of the double-blind phase, 12 h overnight urine collections were made and morning blood samples were taken about 12 h after the last dose of medication. During the double-blind phase, blood pressure in the quinapril group (n = 7) decreased from 159 +/- 3/105 +/- 1 to 141 +/- 6/94 +/- 2 mm Hg (mean +/- SEM). Serum ACE activity and plasma angiotensin II concentration were reduced to 4 +/- 1% and 14 +/- 1% of the pretreatment values, respectively. Neither the plasma concentrations nor the urinary excretions of prostaglandin E2, 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (a prostacyclin metabolite), or thromboxane B2 (a metabolite of thromboxane A2) were affected by quinapril. In the placebo group, blood pressure tended to decline but the biochemical variables remained essentially unchanged. These results indicate that prostanoids are not involved in the antihypertensive action of quinapril, the principal effect of which seems to be inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "304": "The activity of angiotensin converting enzyme(ACE) in crude extracts of the rat renal cortex was increased when the oxidizing agent diamide was added to the extract. The maximal activity was obtained at concentrations over 1 mM, and the value was twice or more the activity in the absence of the pretreatment. The activity of ACE was also increased by the diamide-pretreatment of the isolated membrane fraction of the renal cortex, thereby indicating that the increase in activity was not due to oxidation of endogenous glutathione (GSH) that may lower the ACE activity, but rather that ACE itself was oxidized. When O2 was included in the extract for 2 h, the ACE activity also increased to about twice the original activity. Lineweaver-Burk plots analysis demonstrated that, after oxidation with diamide and O2, the Vmax was increased but the Km remained unchanged. We conclude that the action of ACE in the kidney functions may differ in relation to oxidation of the tissue.", 
    "305": "The haemodynamic effects of combinations of antihypertensive drugs were tested in an open trial on 15 patients with essential arterial hypertension. The following combinations were used: Piretanid/Captopril, Piretanid/Urapidil and Acebutolol/Piretanid. All three combinations significantly lowered arterial pressure at rest and on exercise. Both Piretanid/Captopril and Piretanid/Urapidil reduced the arterial pressure exclusively by reduction of the peripheral resistance, while cardiac output rose. On the other hand, Acebutolol/Piretanid reduced the blood pressure through reduction of cardiac output, less so by lowering the peripheral resistance. Mean pulmonary arterial pressure, as a measure of left-ventricular filling pressure, fell under Piretanid/Captopril and Piretanid/Urapidil, remaining high under Acebutolol/Piretanid. Thus the combinations of Piretanid/Captopril and Piretanid/Urapidil are most likely to fulfill the demands to be placed on an \"ideal\" antihypertensive treatment.", 
    "306": "After oral administration of zofenopril, the active sulfhydryl angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor is released. Zofenopril is currently under clinical investigation as an antihypertensive. Blood samples are reacted with N-ethylmaleimide, immediately after collection, processed into plasma and stored frozen for subsequent analysis. After addition of two internal reference standards, one each for the prodrug and the active compound, the plasma samples are purified by a combination of liquid-liquid and solid-phase extractions. The dried methylated extracts are reconstituted with tetramethylbenzene and chromatographed by automated splitless injection on a fused-silica capillary column, connected to a mass-selective detector. The analytes and the internal reference standards are chromatographically resolved and a common fragment ion is monitored for the analytes. A limit of quantitation of approximately 1 ng/ml of plasma is achieved.", 
    "307": "The intracerebroventricular administration of neuromedin N (from 50 ng to 5 micrograms) elicited a dose- and time-dependent hypothermia in mice. Two aminopeptidase inhibitors, bestatin (50 micrograms) and puromycin (50 micrograms), the endopeptidase 24.11 inhibitor, thiorphan (10 micrograms), and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril (50 micrograms), were tested for their ability to potentiate the neuromedin N-induced hypothermia. Only bestatin significantly increased the response to the peptide. In addition, thiorphan, though devoid of effect on the neuromedin N-induced hypothermia when given alone, further potentiated the response elicited by neuromedin N and bestatin. The combinations of puromycin/thiorphan and bestatin/captopril did not potentiate the neuromedin N-induced hypothermia.", 
    "308": "We examined existing evidence concerning the relative efficacy of various vasodilator agents in chronic congestive heart failure. Only randomized placebo-controlled trials with clinical end points and treatment durations of four weeks or more were selected from an exhaustive search of the English-language medical literature. Twenty-eight trials involving 1976 patients were found. Treatment durations of the trials varied from one month to two years. Patients with symptomatic heart failure despite digitalis and diuretic therapy were studied; most were middle-aged men and approximately half had coronary artery disease. Results of the trials were appraised by three independent observers, and mortality and functional status outcomes were pooled in a meta-analysis. All vasodilator agents except hydralazine hydrochloride were associated with improvements in functional status. Angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitors were the only agents associated with both decreased mortality (odds ratio, 0.51; 95% confidence interval, 0.34 to 0.75) and improved functional status (odds ratio, 4.53; 95% confidence interval, 3.46 to 5.92). The optimal timing for initiation of these agents was not established.", 
    "309": "This article contrasts the characteristics of essential hypertension found in the black population with that seen in the nonblack population. Socioeconomic and pathophysiologic factors are discussed. Different pharmacologic classes of drugs are compared for their effectiveness in treating the black hypertensive patient. Because black hypertensives tend to have salt-sensitive, low-renin hypertension coupled with decreased cardiac output and high peripheral vascular resistance, an ideal antihypertensive should have natriuretic effects but also the physiologic capability of reducing vascular resistance. Such an ideal hypertensive drug would be able to lower systemic blood pressure while improving organ perfusion and function.", 
    "310": "We studied the effects of a new topical angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, SCH 33861, in lowering intraocular pressure in 20 patients with ocular hypertension or primary open-angle glaucoma. In a double-masked, four-way crossover study with placebo and timolol, SCH 33861 was well tolerated and effective in lowering intraocular pressure. The magnitude of the drug's effect in lowering intraocular pressure was less than that of timolol 0.5%.", 
    "311": "Despite improved patient detection and pharmacologic therapy, the effect of treatment of hypertension on mortality from coronary artery-related events remains unresolved. Left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, a known consequence of hypertension, is associated with an excess mortality independent of other known cardiovascular risk factors. Recently, LV hypertrophy accompanying hypertension has been associated with ominous ventricular arrhythmias. However, it does not necessarily follow that regression of LV hypertrophy will reduce this increased mortality. Diastolic dysfunction, manifested by reduced ventricular distensibility of the hypertrophying left ventricle, appears to be an early characteristic of the hypertensive heart since echocardiographic techniques have demonstrated diastolic filling abnormalities in untreated essential hypertensives even before significant LV hypertrophy appears. Not all antihypertensive agents diminish LV mass and improve diastolic dysfunction. Certain sympatholytic agents, calcium antagonists, beta-adrenergic blockers, and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors appear to diminish LV hypertrophy. However, future studies are needed to determine if these agents that appear to reverse findings of LV hypertrophy and improve diastolic dysfunction will also reduce risk of coronary artery disease and related events.", 
    "312": "We present a case in which a patient took an overdose of captopril (Capoten) and alprazolam (Xanax) in a suicide attempt. The patient presented with hypotension (systolic blood pressure of 80 mm Hg) and drowsiness. The hypotension initially responded to administration of intravenous fluids and dopamine; however, it recurred twice at 18.5 and 24.5 hours after ingestion. These episodes again responded to administration of fluids and dopamine. A plasma captopril level of 27,391.1 nmol/L (5982 ng/mL) was documented, as well as a depressed level of angiotensin converting enzyme. Captopril is an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor used in the management of hypertension and ventricular failure; to our knowledge, this is the first case of an acute captopril overdose reported in the English-language literature. The role of captopril in inducing hypotension is discussed herein.", 
    "313": "A58365A and A58365B, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors isolated from the culture filtrate of Streptomyces chromofuscus NRRL 15098, are homologous compounds of molecular formulas C12H13NO6 and C13H15NO6. The molecular similarities of the two inhibitors were established by comparison of their 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and UV spectra. Catalytic hydrogenation of A58365A led to a tetrahydro-deoxy derivative, C12H17NO5; extensive 1H NMR decoupling studies at 360 MHz allowed all the non-exchangeable protons of the derivative to be connected in a continuous substructure. This fragment was combined with information from other spectroscopic methods to suggest the structures for A58365A (1) and A58365B (2); the conclusions were confirmed by an X-ray crystallographic analysis of A58365A-dimethyl ester.", 
    "314": "In prior years the major differences noted between hypertension in black and white patients have been mostly epidemiological, with some suggestion that the differences were primarily quantitative and probably not qualitative. Recently, certain pathophysiological aberrations in hypertensive patients have been shown to be different in blacks and whites. Whether these differences are primary (genetic) or secondary has yet to be resolved. Nevertheless, certain racial differences may have therapeutic implications. Diuretics remain the mainstay of therapy for most hypertensive black patients. beta-Blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have not shown great efficacy when used as monotherapy in black hypertensive patients. The combination of a diuretic with beta-blockers or ACE inhibitors, however, has been shown to abolish black-white differences in drug response. More recently, the calcium channel blockers have been shown to be potentially effective in black hypertensive patients. In spite of the effective drug therapy that is available for hypertensive patients in general, economic and social considerations continue to contribute to the low rate of detection, treatment, and control of hypertension in the black population.", 
    "315": "Low-dose angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition is thought to completely block the renin-angiotensin system. This study examined the hemodynamic and hormonal responses to initial low- and higher dose converting-enzyme inhibitor (lisinopril or captopril) at rest compared with the response during subsequent chronic therapy while treadmill exercise testing was performed in nine patients with chronic heart failure. At rest, similar changes in systemic arterial pressure, plasma renin activity, and plasma aldosterone concentration were found with initial low and higher doses. However, after at least 4 weeks of therapy, dose-dependent increases in plasma renin activity and decreases in plasma aldosterone concentration were noted during exercise without significant differences in exercise systemic arterial pressure or heart rate. This discrepancy suggests that initial low-dose converting enzyme inhibition does completely block the enzyme, but higher dose therapy is required for complete blockade during subsequent exercise in chronic heart failure.", 
    "316": "The low renal resistance to blood flow in the presence of an activated endogenous renin-angiotensin system in gravid animals may in part be mediated by the action of eicosanoids produced in situ. To evaluate intrarenal eicosanoid production during gestation in rabbits, we quantitated immunoreactive PGE2, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha (a stable metabolite of PGI2) and thromboxane B2 (a stable metabolite of thromboxane A2) in unextracted media after incubation of renal slices and isolated glomeruli. In cortical slices from nonpregnant and pregnant rabbits, PGE2 production (micrograms.g-1.30 min-1) was 0.04 +/- 0.005 and 0.08 +/- 0.01 (P less than 0.01) and 6 keto-PGF1 alpha was 0.03 +/- 0.01 and 0.06 +/- 0.01 (P less than 0.05), respectively. In papillary slices, PGE2 production was 14 +/- 2 and 21 +/- 2 (P less than 0.05) and 6 keto-PGF1 alpha was 4 +/- 1 and 5 +/- 1 (P greater than 0.05) for nonpregnant and pregnant rabbits, respectively. Thromboxane B2 production was unchanged during pregnancy in both cortex and papilla. Acute captopril administration to nonpregnant and to pregnant rabbits in vivo failed to alter in vitro renal slice eicosanoid production. Isolated glomeruli from nonpregnant and pregnant rabbits synthesized PGE2 at similar rates. Exogenous arachidonic acid increased PGE2 production (P less than 0.05), but angiotensin II had no effect on eicosanoid production in vitro. These data suggest that the net synthesis of vasodilator eicosanoids is enhanced during gestation in rabbits.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "317": "Renin-angiotensin system activation is suspected of being involved in postcoronary surgery hypertension, but appears to be useful in maintaining blood pressure during anesthesia and cardiopulmonary bypass. To clarify these points, 19 patients were compared: ten as a control group and nine who received captopril during two days before surgery. Anesthesia was the same for the two groups, and cardiopulmonary bypass ensured nonpulsatile flow rates. Anesthesia induced a slight decrease in the mean arterial blood pressure of the treated group (91.1 +/- 3.3 mm Hg to 83.3 +/- 3.9 mm Hg), which did not occur in the control group (89.9 +/- 5.8 mm Hg to 89.7 +/- 4.9 mm Hg). During cardiopulmonary bypass, the mean arterial blood pressure was maintained at comparable levels in the two groups (65.6 +/- 3.5 mm Hg in the control group, 72.6 +/- 3.0 mm Hg in the treated group), with same pump flow rates. After cardiopulmonary bypass, the mean arterial blood pressure returned nearly to prebypass values. Postoperatively, three patients in the control group and four in the treated group developed hypertension. Thus, preoperative renin-angiotensin system blockade by a converting-enzyme inhibitor did not impair blood pressure regulation during anesthesia and cardiopulmonary bypass, but failed to prevent hypertension following coronary surgery.", 
    "318": "Converting-enzyme inhibition, whether teprotide, captopril, or enalapril is used, produces a larger increase in renal blood flow in patients with essential hypertension than in normal subjects when they are on a low-salt diet, a quantitative difference. When studies were performed in individuals on a high-salt diet, normal subjects showed little or no response, whereas a substantial number of patients with essential hypertension displayed an increase in renal blood flow with these agents, a qualitative difference. The individuals that show this potentiated response we now are coming to recognize, have a number of features that suggest a distinct subgroup, the \"nonmodulators.\" Normotensive offspring of hypertensive patients show a directionally similar but smaller renal vascular response to converting-enzyme inhibition. These hypertensive patients also show a blunted natriuresis in response to a sodium loading, which is corrected by converting-enzyme inhibition. Several lines of evidence suggest that the locus of action is intrarenal rather than systemic. Plasma renin activity and plasma angiotensin II concentration are not higher in these subjects, and thus cannot account for their potentiated response to converting-enzyme inhibition. Moreover, the infusion of captopril directly into the renal artery in doses far too low to induce a systemic effect increases renal blood flow specifically in these subjects. They also show a blunted rate of renin suppression after a sodium load, although plasma renin activity falls to the same low level at steady state.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "319": "The presence of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in extrarenal tissues, namely the vascular wall and brain tissue, is well established. The availability of effective blocking agents, converting-enzyme inhibitors, has made it possible to further elucidate important functions of the extrarenal RAS. We have found that the angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitor captopril shifts the limits of cerebral blood flow autoregulation to lower blood pressure levels in normotensive and in spontaneously hypertensive rats. This effect may explain our finding of a remarkable preservation of cerebral blood flow, despite significant blood pressure reduction, in patients with chronic heart failure. We suggest that the effect of angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibition on autoregulation of cerebral blood flow is mediated by a dilatation of larger cerebral arteries, which results from inhibition of the vascular tone normally maintained by locally produced angiotensin II.", 
    "320": "The renin-angiotensin system has traditionally been viewed as an endocrine system. Recent data demonstrate that renin and angiotensinogen genes and their products are expressed at many local tissue sites. The concept that multiple tissues synthesize angiotensin has changed our understanding of the physiology of the renin-angiotensin system. These potential autocrine-paracrine systems may be important in the regulation of local tissue functions in addition to the circulating endocrine system. The activity of the tissue system under different conditions can influence the pharmacologic response to inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system. For example, evidence suggests that tissue angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) may be the primary site of action of ACE inhibitors. Consequently, the duration of action of an ACE inhibitor may be more dependent on the duration of tissue ACE inhibition than on the drug's serum half-life. The differential effects of these pharmacologic inhibitors on the tissue renin-angiotensin systems may form the basis of differentiation between the various ACE inhibitors.", 
    "321": "The effects of captopril and zofenoprilate (the active form of the prodrug zofenopril and also a sulfhydryl-containing angiotension converting-enzyme inhibitor) on coronary flow in the isolated rat heart were compared with the effects of a nonsulfhydryl converting-enzyme inhibitor, ramiprilate (the active form of the prodrug ramipril) and of sulfhydryl-containing compounds with no converting-enzyme inhibiting properties such as glutathione, cysteine, and the (R,S)-isomer of captopril. Drug concentrations of the angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitors were equipotent in their effect on angiotensin I pressor response. Concentrations of the other compounds were equimolar with respect to the sulfhydryl group. Hearts treated with captopril, its isomer, zofenoprilate, cysteine, and glutathione showed significant increases in coronary flow by 5 min of perfusion. In contrast, ramiprilate treatment resulted in a slower increase in coronary flow that was only significant after 20 min of perfusion. The effect of ramiprilate was associated with a significant increase in 6-keto-prostaglandin (PG) F1 alpha overflow in the coronary effluent compared with that in saline-treated hearts, whereas captopril and glutathione had no significant effect on overflow of the measured cyclooxygenase products 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, thromboxane B2, and PGE2. The effects of captopril, zofenoprilate, and glutathione on coronary flow were dose dependent. These results corroborate the view that ramiprilate enhances coronary flow by affecting prostacyclin synthesis, mediated by an increase of endogenous bradykinin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

A number of compounds in this series showed potent ACE inhibitory activity in vitro and in vivo. Structure-activity studies indicated that a piperidyl moiety on the amino group at the 3-position in this series conferred long-lasting ACE inhibitory activity and that the duration of activity depended on the length of the carbon chain in the 1-carboxy-omega-(4-piperidyl)alkyl group. (R)-3-[(S)-1-carboxy-5-(4-piperidyl)-pentyl]amino-4-oxo-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro- 1,5-benzothiazepine-5-acetic acid (CV-5975) was selected as the most promising ACE inhibitor for further studies because of its marked inhibitory activity.",

The antiserum was specific for MC-838, showing only slight crossreactivity with degradation products of MC-838. After a single oral dose of MC-838 (2 mg/kg), radioimmunoassay of MC-838 canine serum demonstrated rapid absorption from the gastrointestinal tract with a peak level of 40.6 ng/ml.

Eight days after, kaliemia was 4.2 mmol/l, PRA was 0.5 ng/ml/h. Light microscopy showed that affected area was sharply delimited from surrounding normal tissue. In this area, glomeruli were present and seemed more numerous as usual; interstitial fibrosis and infiltrates of inflammatory cells were also noted. The main fact was tortuosities of intralobular arteries, thickened, with intimal proliferation. There was a pelvic recess near this cortical tissue. Immunofluorescence findings: antirenin serum fixed on JGA but also on interlobular arterial walls and on peritubular interstitium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

At D (45) the treatment was crossed, at D (90) all the patients received both drugs and at D (135) the treatment was stopped. According to the antihypertensive response, the patients were divided into: (i) R: responders, PAS (systolic arterial pressure) less than or equal to 140 mmHg and PAD (diastolic) less than or equal to 90 mmHg, ii) M: moderate responders, 140 less than PAS less than or equal to 160 mmHg and/or 90 less than PAD less than or equal to 100 mmHg and (iii) F: therapeutic failure, PAS greater than 160 mmHg and/or PAD greater than 100. A parallel study was carried out in erythrocytes. At D (0), 40 ml of blood were drawn and the hypertensive patients were classified in: (i) (+)NaT patients, 19 patients having one or more of the following erythrocyte abnormalities: increased Na+: Li+ counter-transport, increased Na+ leak, decreased affinity of the Na+, K+-pump and/or Na+, K+ cotransport system for internal Na+ and (ii) (-)NaT patients, 11 patients without the above erythrocyte abnormalities. During monotherapy treatment (with captopril or hydrochlorothiazide) 8 out of 11 (-)NaT patients normalized blood pressure (responders) against only 5 out of 19 (+)NaT patients (p less than 0.05, chi 2 test).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "327": "Renal hemodynamics and natriuresis have been studied before and 6 hours after oral intake of perindopril (8 mg) in 8 hypertensive patients without renal failure. Then, the patients were treated with perindopril (8 mg per day) and renal hemodynamics was repeated on the fifth day, 6 hours after the morning intake of the substance. Sodium diet was controlled during the study (100 mmol sodium per day). Renal blood flow (RBF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were measured by the clearance method using 131I-hippuran and 125I-iothalamate respectively. The results are as follows: (table; see text) Perindopril produced a potent renal vasodilatation after the first intake and the following days without any change in GFR. A significant decrease in FF was observed indicating that efferent as well as afferent arteriolar vasodilatation was induced. Perindopril produced an increase in natriuresis after the first intake and at D5; this natriuretic effect may be related to the changes in renal hemodynamics inducing a decreased sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubule.", 
    "328": "An orally active renin inhibitor, ES 6864 (N-[(2R)-3-morpholinocarbonyl-2-(1-naphthylmethyl)propionyl]-(4- thiazolyl)-L-alanyl-cyclostatine-(2-morpholinoethyl)amide), was synthesized. ES 6864 was found to be a highly potent inhibitor of human renin with a Ki value of 7.3 x 10(-9) M. The compound competitively inhibited human renin. The inhibitor was also potent against monkey renin but was less effective against renins from pig, goat, dog, rabbit, and rat. ES 6864 did not inhibit cathepsin D, pepsin, trypsin, chymotrypsin, angiotensin converting enzyme, and urinary kallikrein at a concentration of 10(-5) M. ES 6864 was resistant to proteolytic actions of the enzymes in rat tissue homogenates (liver, kidney, pancreas, and small intestine). Oral administration of ES 6864 at 30 mg/kg to conscious, sodium-depleted marmosets produced a significant blood pressure reduction and almost complete inhibition of plasma renin activity, which persisted for 5 hours. Oral administration of ES 6864 also produced dose-related decreases of blood pressure in hog renin-infused rats, but the duration of action was much shorter than that in conscious marmosets. The parent compound in the blood following oral administration of ES 6864 to marmosets was confirmed directly by measuring the plasma concentration of ES 6864. These results enhance the possibility of developing renin inhibitors that can be used clinically.", 
    "329": "We report a case of severe hypertension with an occluded renal artery to a solitary kidney, who developed sudden deterioration of renal function following treatment with captopril. His renal function remained impaired but stable during 2 years' treatment with captopril but returned to pre-treatment levels soon after cessation of the drug. This indicates reversibility in captopril-induced renal failure even after its prolonged use and suggests that no organic damage occurs to glomerular arterioles following chronic ACE inhibition.", 
    "330": "A 70 year old patient with malignant hypertension due to bilateral renal artery disease developed acute renal failure within 36 hrs of starting an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Review of the consecutive series of 14 patients with bilateral renal artery disease who had also been given ACE inhibitors showed that functional renal sufficiency was common but not invariable under these circumstances. Although renal function returned towards pretreatment levels in most cases when ACE inhibitors were withdrawn, the speed with which acute renal failure may occasionally develop suggests that renal artery disease should be excluded before prescribing ACE inhibitors for hypertensive patients with undiagnosed renal impairment.", 
    "331": "The BP of 12 patients with essential hypertension was controlled with captopril over a period of three months. Cerebral blood flow, muscle blood flow (anterior tibialis muscle), platelet aggregation and platelet thromboxane A2 release were measured during a baseline drug-free period, and measurements repeated during the treatment phase on achieving BP control, after one and three months. Cerebral blood flow rose during the early phase of treatment and then dropped to baseline levels during chronic therapy. Muscle blood flow, both at rest and following maximal exercise, was unaffected by captopril therapy. Platelet aggregation was diminished during therapy, and this finding was paralleled by a reduction in platelet thromboxane A2 generation. Control of hypertension with maintenance of regional blood flow and beneficial changes in platelet function during treatment with captopril may improve the overall risk profile of hypertensive patients. Inhibition of platelet aggregation and thromboxane A2 release may contribute to the antihypertensive action of captopril and the maintenance of regional blood flow.", 
    "332": "The renin-angiotensin system is activated in heart failure in proportion to the severity of the haemodynamic derangement and to diuretic dose. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduce circulating levels of angiotensin II and aldosterone and, in some patients, plasma noradrenaline, vasopressin and cortisol. Typically there is potassium retention and a minor increase in plasma potassium, but cumulative sodium balance may increase or decrease depending on pretreatment fluid and haemodynamic status and on policy regarding diuretic dose. Circulatory dynamics usually improve and blood flow to the brain, myocardium and kidneys is preserved. Changes in glomerular filtration rate are dictated by haemodynamic characteristics and, again, by diuretic dose and dietary sodium. There are potential hazards with ACE inhibitor therapy but most problems can be anticipated and avoided. Future trends may include the introduction of ACE inhibitors with or without concomitant diuretic therapy in early cardiac failure, and intravenous ACE inhibition immediately after acute myocardial infartion. Whether the ACE inhibitors will prove more successful than alternative antihypertensive agents in preventing cardiac complications (including heart failure) of hypertension, is an intriguing question.", 
    "333": "Neurohumoral vasoconstrictor systems are activated in heart failure and influence left ventricular function by modifying pre- and afterload. The renin-angiotensin system, sympathetic nerve activity and vasopressin have all been implicated as mechanisms of vasoconstriction. We investigated the vasoconstrictive action of vasopressin by blocking its vascular receptors by a specific antagonist in animal models of heart failure due to rapid right ventricular pacing in dogs and to aortocaval fistula, pulmonary stenosis and aortic stenosis in rats. In all animal models studied, we observed an inappropirately elevated secretion of vasopressin in association with a decreased plasma osmolality. We found only a small reduction of aortic pressure and peripheral vascular resistance following the vasopressin inhibitor. The renin-angiotensin system and sympathetic nerve activity were activated in all animal models. We injected teprotide in order to test the role of angiotensin in the regulation of peripheral vascular tone, and found a much greater decrease of blood pressure and peripheral vascular resistance than caused by the vasopressin antagonist. These experiments suggest that vasopressin and the renin system increase peripheral vascular tone in certain models of heart failure, and demonstrate a much greater importance for the renin system.", 
    "334": "Autoregulation of blood flow was assessed by a dual-slit technique in descending and ascending vasa recta of the exposed renal papillae of antidiuretic rats. There was complete autoregulation of blood flow in descending vasa recta. The lower limit of autoregulation was approximately 85 mmHg (1 mmHg = 133.3 Pa) and the upper limit was greater then 160 mmHg. Autoregulation in ascending vasa recta was also good. To test the role of angiotensin II in this autoregulation, the converting enzyme inhibitor captopril was infused. Captopril had no effect on autoregulation of blood flow in either descending or ascending vasa recta. We conclude that blood flow in vasa recta of renal medulla is efficiently autoregulated and that this autoregulation is independent of angiotensin II.", 
    "335": "Ferret tracheal segments were infected with human influenza virus A/Taiwan/86 (H1N1) in vitro. After 4 days, the smooth muscle contractile responses to acetylcholine and to substance P were measured. The response to substance P was markedly accentuated, with a threefold increase in force of contraction at a substance P concentration of 10(-5) M, the highest concentration tested. In contrast, the response to acetylcholine was not affected by viral infection. Histological examination of tissues revealed extensive epithelial desquamation. Activity of enkephalinase (neutral metallo-endopeptidase, EC.3.4.24.11), an enzyme that degrades substance P, was decreased by 50% in infected tissues. Inhibiting enkephalinase activity by pretreating with thiorphan (10(-5) M) increased the response to substance P to the same final level in both infected and control tissues. Inhibiting other substance P-degrading enzymes including kininase II (angiotensin-converting enzyme), serine proteases, and aminopeptidases did not affect the response to substance P. Inhibiting cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase activity using indomethacin and BW 755c did not affect hyperresponsiveness to substance P. Pretreating tissues with antagonists of alpha-adrenoceptors, beta-adrenoceptors, and H1 histamine receptors (phentolamine 10(-5) M, propranolol 5 X 10(-6) M, and pyrilamine 10(-5) M, respectively) had no effect on substance P-induced contraction. These results demonstrate that infection of ferret airway tissues with influenza virus increases the contractile response of airway smooth muscle to substance P. This effect is caused by decreased enkephalinase activity in infected tissues.", 
    "336": "Cardiac failure is characterised by a marked reduction in renal blood flow. However, urea excretion and glomerular filtration rate remain well preserved until the terminal stages. Intrarenal compensatory actions of the renin-angiotensin system probably effect this compensation. Important interrelations have recently been observed between the renin and atrial peptide systems. The latter, which is activated in cardiac failure, tends to emphasise the useful intrarenal effects while minimising the less valuable peripheral actions of the renin system in that condition.", 
    "337": "We report a method for the extraction of angiotensin peptides from plasma with a mixture of acetone, 1 mol/L HCl, and water (40/1/5 by vol). The method is highly reproducible for the measurement of angiotensin I and angiotensin II in small sample volumes, with analytical recoveries of about 80% for both peptides. We investigated the influence of sample handling and found a standard procedure for blood collection, plasma preparation, and extraction was essential. The method was used to measure angiotensin I and II in rat and human plasma. In rat plasma, the mean (+/- SEM) concentrations of angiotensin I and angiotensin II were determined to be 67 (+/- 8) and 14 (+/- 1) pmol/L (n = 10), respectively. Neither angiotensin I nor angiotensin II was detectable 24 h after bilateral nephrectomy. Acute oral administration of the converting-enzyme inhibitor ramipril caused a significant increase of angiotensin I from 85 (+/- 6) to 257 (+/- 33) pmol/L (n = 10; P less than 0.001) and a significant decrease of angiotensin II from 12 (+/- 1) to 7 (+/- 0.4) pmol/L in rat plasma (n = 9; P less than 0.001). In human plasma, angiotensin I and angiotensin II values of 21 (+/- 1) and 6.6 (+/- 0.5) pmol/L (n = 10) were found. A single oral dose of the diuretic furosemide increased angiotensin I significantly from 21 (+/- 1) to 32 (+/- 1.7) pmol/L (n = 5); P less than 0.001), whereas angiotensin II remained unchanged, 6.6 (+/- 0.5) vs 6.4 (+/- 0.4) pmol/L (n = 5). Extracted peptides could be identified as [IIe5]-angiotensin I and [IIe5]-angiotensin II by HPLC in combination with specific radioimmunoassays for angiotensin I and angiotensin II.", 
    "338": "Despite a dramatic fall in renal blood flow, glomerular filtration rate is usually preserved in patients with congestive heart failure until the terminal stages of the disease. This maintenance of renal function appears to be achieved in part by the synthesis of two vasoactive factors within the kidney--angiotensin II and prostaglandins--which are rapidly released whenever renal perfusion is compromised or sympathetic nerve traffic to the kidneys is increased. Although these two hormonal systems exert opposite effects on systemic and renal blood flow and sodium and water excretion, both act to preserve glomerular filtration rate: prostaglandins by a vasodilator action exerted primarily on the afferent arteriole and angiotensin II by a vasoconstrictor effect on the efferent arteriole. Consequently, when the synthesis of these hormones is experimentally blocked, renal function deteriorates, especially in subjects with marked renal hypoperfusion and sodium depletion; these two factors interact to determine the importance of intrarenal hormonal release in the modulation of renal function. Clinically, four specific factors have been identified that predispose patients with heart failure to the development of functional renal insufficiency after treatment with converting-enzyme or cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors: (1) marked renal hypoperfusion, (2) vigorous diuretic therapy, (3) diabetes mellitus, and (4) intensity of hormonal inhibition within the kidney. This last risk factor may provide the basis for differentiating among enzyme-inhibitory drugs and suggests that renal insufficiency in low-output states may be minimized by the development of therapeutic agents that block hormonal synthesis selectively at sites that are critical to the disease process but spare the homeostatic tissue-based enzyme systems that exist within the kidney.", 
    "339": "The major therapeutic goals in the treatment of congestive heart failure are the relief of symptoms and the prolongation of life, but it remains unclear whether there is a relation between changes in exercise tolerance and alterations in the risk of death. Although all vasodilator and inotropic agents produce short-term haemodynamic benefits, these acute effects do not predict the long-term clinical responses to these drugs. Converting-enzyme inhibitors appear to improve symptoms and survival. A combination of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate produces variable effects on exercise tolerance but appears to prolong life. Catecholamines and phosphodiesterase inhibitors may reduce dyspnea and fatigue but adversely affect mortality. Calcium channel blocking drugs may exert deleterious effects on both symptoms and prognosis. alpha-Adrenergic blocking drugs produce no beneficial or adverse effects on clinical status or mortality. Hence, there is no consistent relation between the symptomatic and prognostic effects of drug therapy in patients with chronic heart failure. This variability makes it impossible to predict the effects of any drug on exercise tolerance or survival based on an evaluation of the agent's short-term haemodynamic effects.", 
    "340": "1. Cardiac output, its distribution and regional vascular resistances were determined with tracer microspheres in pithed rats in the presence of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril. The effects of enalapril on the cardiovascular responses elicited by either the alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine or the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist xylazine were determined. 2. Enalapril decreased diastolic and mean blood pressure by decreasing cardiac index and total peripheral resistance. It induced vasodilatation in the kidney, epididimides, epididimidal fat and pancreas/mesentery. Vasoconstriction in the lungs, testes and liver was evident following enalapril administration as well as a decrease in the proportion of cardiac output passing to them, whilst the pancreas and mesentery received a greater proportion of the cardiac output. All the above effects of enalapril were reversed by infusion of angiotensin II at a rate of 75 ng kg-1 min-1. 3. Xylazine increased blood pressure by increasing both cardiac output and total peripheral resistance. Enalapril did not affect the increase in cardiac output caused by xylazine but decreased the effect of the alpha 2-agonist on blood pressure by preventing the increase in total peripheral resistance. Inhibition by enalapril of xylazine-induced vasoconstriction in the kidneys, testes, fat and gastrointestinal tract contributed to the decrease in total peripheral resistance. Enalapril also inhibited xylazine-induced changes in cardiac output distribution to the liver, lungs and heart. All the above effects of enalapril were reversed by infusion of angiotensin II. 4. Enalapril decreased the sustained phase of the pressor response to an infusion of phenylephrine whilst having no effect on the initial peak pressor response to a bolus injection of phenylephrine. Phenylephrine increased both cardiac output and total peripheral resistance and enalapril abolished its effect on total peripheral resistance whilst having no effect on the increase in cardiac output. Enalapril inhibited phenylephrine-induced vasoconstriction in the testes, fat, muscle, spleen and gastrointestinal tract. Enalapril also inhibited phenylephrine-induced changes in cardiac output distribution to the lungs and liver. The infusion of angiotensin II did not fully reverse the inhibitory effect of enalapril either on the phenylephrine-induced increases in diastolic blood pressure or on the vasoconstriction in the fat, spleen and gastrointestinal tract, but did reverse all other effects of enalapril.", 
    "341": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been demonstrated to possess proinflammatory properties. Persistent cough and increased broncho-obstruction have been reported frequently in hypertensive subjects on ACE inhibitor therapy. We have studied the effect of an alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist, clonidine, on MK 422 (active parent diacid of enalapril)-induced hypotension and potentiated inflammatory skin responses in ovalbumin-sensitized guinea pigs. Clonidine was found to abolish dose-dependently MK 422-potentiated ovalbumin-evoked inflammatory dermal responses and it possesses additive hypotensive effects when combined with the ACE inhibitor. It would therefore be interesting to evaluate further alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonists and ACE inhibitors in a combination therapy in humans when single drug antihypertensive therapy of the drugs is insufficient.", 
    "342": "Hypertension is a major risk factor for arteriosclerotic vascular disease. Despite intensive antihypertensive intervention, the risk of cardiovascular disease has not declined appreciably. Many of the antihypertensive agents have been shown to elevate total serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels or lower the high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol level. Thus, the antihypertensive agents chosen may negate the beneficial effects of a lower blood pressure. Our purpose is to review all available antihypertensive medications and their influence on lipoprotein metabolism. Choosing the antihypertensive therapy least likely to worsen or precipitate other known cardiovascular risk factors is important. Cost and side effect profiles must also be considered in choosing the best antihypertensive regimen for your patients.", 
    "343": "The effects of nifedipine and enalapril on blood pressure (BP), heart rate, plasma and urine electrolyte, plasma renin activity (PRA), aldosterone and catecholamines, were studied in ten elderly hypertensive subjects in a randomised, single-blind, cross-over trial. Both nifedipine and enalapril were effective in lowering supine and erect systolic and diastolic BP, with nifedipine causing a significant (P less than 0.05) rise in heart rate. Arterial pressure rose to pre-treatment levels on withdrawal of both drugs. Plasma glucose fell significantly (P less than 0.02) on enalapril therapy, whilst no other biochemical changes were observed. PRA, aldosterone and adrenaline rose on nifedipine therapy whereas PRA showed a greater rise on enalapril with a fall in plasma aldosterone and no change in plasma adrenaline. Plasma noradrenaline was not altered by either agent. Unacceptable side effects occurred in patients taking nifedipine resulting in discontinuation of therapy in 2 patients and death in another. Nifedipine or enalapril monotherapy is effective in lowering BP in the elderly hypertensives. Although more experience is needed, the side effect profile of both agents especially enalapril, appears satisfactory.", 
    "344": "The renal functional alterations that occurred in streptozotocin-induced diabetes in uninephrectomized rats were studied over a three-month period. Diabetic animals had elevated systemic systolic blood pressure, creatinine clearance and urinary protein excretion. After three months, systolic blood pressure was 131 +/- 2 mmHg, creatinine clearance was 1.52 +/- 0.06 ml/min and urinary protein excretion 70.8 +/- 17.9 mg/24 h. Non-diabetic control rats had a systolic blood pressure of 117 +/- 3 mmHg (p less than 0.001), creatinine clearance of 1.15 +/- 0.05 ml/min (p less than 0.001), and protein excretion of 8.22 +/- 0.2 mg/24 h (p less than 0.001). Diabetic rats were treated with enalapril or verapamil, 5 mg.kg-1.day-1 which reduced systolic blood pressure to 108 +/- 3 mmHg (p less than 0.001) and 114 +/- 2 mmHg (p less than 0.001) respectively. Treatment with enalapril reduced the degree of proteinuria at three months (36.4 +/- 3.0 mg/24 h, p less than 0.05). Protein excretion rate in verapamil treated rats was 57.7 +/- 10.1 mg/24 h at three months, similar to that of untreated diabetic rats. Filtration fraction of untreated diabetic rats was 0.40 +/- 0.04. Treatment with enalapril lowered filtration fraction (0.26 +/- 0.02, p less than 0.01) whilst verapamil had no significant effect (0.37 +/- 0.02). The differing effects of enalapril and verapamil on renal function occurred despite similar degrees of hypotension, and may reflect the different intrarenal haemodynamic effects of these drugs.", 
    "345": "24 patients with severe heart failure (NYHA III) were randomly assigned to an additional therapy with captopril or enalapril. The mean daily dose of captopril was 56 +/- 2 mg and of enalapril, 9.6 +/- 0.9 mg. After a mean of 9 days, the influence of both inhibitors of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE-inhibitors) on hemodynamics and renal function was evaluated. The mean arterial pressure in the group treated with captopril (group A) fell by 11 +/- 2 mm Hg (p less than 0.001), with enalapril (group B) by 13 +/- 3 mm Hg (p less than 0.01), the difference between the groups not being significant. Heart rate decreased in both groups to a similar degree. The change was significant only in the patients treated with enalapril (13 +/- 4/min; p less than 0.05 vs. 11 +/- 5/min in group A). Stroke volume index increased by 10 +/- 2 ml/m2 in group A vs. 12 +/- 2 ml/m2 in group B; both increases were highly significant (p less than 0.001).

Three series of seven hypertensive rats (SHR) were used. The reduction of the aortic flow (QAO) due to ischemia (produced by a left coronary artery ligation of 10 mn) was brought into line with the reduction of the coronary flow (QCORO) and the weight of the heart. This reduction was 2.06 +/- 1.8 for the control, 1.96 +/- 1.27 when captopril (CAP) (10(-5) M) was added to the perfusion liquid and 1 +/- 0.42 when perindopril (PER) (1.2 x 10(-5) M) was added to the perfusion liquid (p less than 0.05 vs CAP). Four series of 10 rat hearts (Sprague Dawley) were used to study the changes on the working heart caused by short perfusions of AI or AII (10(-7) M) in the presence of IEC or saralasin (SAR 10(-7) M). AII caused a reduction of the QCORO of 2.1 +/- 0.26 ml/mn, an increase of the QAO of 2.5 +/- 0.9 ml/mn and an increase of the heart rate (HR) of 9 +/- 3.24 beats/mn. In the presence of CAP or PER the effects of AII were the same, however in the presence of SAR these effects were prevented. AI caused a reduction of the QCOR of 2.5 +/- 0.4 ml/mn, an increase of the QAO of 2.5 +/- 0.8 ml/mn and an increase of the HR of 18 +/- 4 beats/mn.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

In order to determine if ICE may have an effect on the transmembrane Na movements implicated in the regulation of vascular tone, we have studied the effects of trandolapril and enalapril on 22Na effluxes from the tail artery of 20 weeks old SHR. In vivo, the chronic oral treatment (14 days) with trandolapril (1.3 mg/kg/day) decreased the ouabain-sensitive 22Na efflux (controls: 0.050 +/- 0.004 min-1 (n = 8); trandolapril (1 mg/kg): 0.030 +/- 0.03 min-1 (n = 10) p less than 0.01), and the ouabain-insensitive 22Na efflux (controls: 0.088 +/- 0.0030 min-1; trandolapril (1 mg/kg): 0.080 +/- 0.003 min-1 (n = 10) p less than 0.05). Enalapril had no effect at the dose of 10 mg/kg/day (14 days).

    "349": "To assess the effect of dibutylyl cyclic AMP (DBcAMP) on patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) in comparison with dobutamine and captopril, these three agents were administered to 9 patients with CHF. DBcAMP was infused at a rate of 0.2 mg/kg.min for 30 min, dobutamine was infused at a rate of 8 micrograms/kg.min and captopril 25 mg was administered orally. Hemodynamic and echocardiographic studies were performed before and after administration of each agent. Systolic arterial pressure (SAP) fell with DBcAMP and captopril but rose with dobutamine. Cardiac output (CO) rose and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) fell with each agent but the magnitude of the change was greater with DBcAMP than with the other two agents. Left ventricular end-systolic dimension decreased and percent fractional shortening increased with all these drugs. Comparing DBcAMP and captopril, although the degree of change in CO was closely correlated with that in SVR by captopril, the degree of increase in CO by DBcAMP was more than that expected from the degree of the decrease of SVR. Comparing DBcAMP and dobutamine, SAP and pressure rate product increased with dobutamine, but the former fell and the latter was not changed by DBcAMP. Arrhythmia was not increased by DBcAMP, though it was markedly increased by dobutamine. In conclusion, the magnitude of positive inotropic and vasodilator effect of DBcAMP was equal to or greater than that of dobutamine or captopril. So DBcAMP is thought to be useful for the treatment of CHF.", 
    "350": "Lisinopril is an orally active angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor which at dosages of 20 to 80 mg once daily is effective in lowering blood pressure in all grades of essential hypertension. It is at least as effective as usual therapeutic dosages of hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, metoprolol and nifedipine while direct comparisons with other ACE inhibitors have not been reported. Many patients achieve an adequate blood pressure reduction with lisinopril alone, and in those who do not, most will with the addition of hydrochlorothiazide; lisinopril also attenuates hypokalaemia induced by thiazide diuretics. In patients with congestive heart failure resistant to conventional therapy, lisinopril 2.5 to 20 mg once daily improved indices of cardiac function and appeared to produce greater benefit than captopril in one controlled study. Lisinopril is well tolerated, with few serious adverse effects being reported. Thus, lisinopril is a suitable treatment for essential hypertension and shows promise in the treatment of congestive heart failure. If additional studies confirm these preliminary findings, then lisinopril will have a similar profile of indications to other ACE inhibitors, and like some other drugs in this class it offers the convenience of once daily administration.", 
    "351": "In order to establish if pharmacological treatment of systemic hypertension modifies the course of progressive renal failure, we studied the effects of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and a calcium antagonist, on the renal structure and function in the remnant kidney model of chronic renal failure in the rat. Progressive renal failure was induced in adult female Sprague Dawley rats (SDR) by surgical removal of the right kidney, and segmental infarction of seven-eighths of the left kidney. Following subtotal nephrectomy, plasma creatinine rose from 65 +/- 16 mumol/l to 173 +/- 19 mumol/l (P less than 0.001) over a period of 6 weeks, systolic blood pressure (SBP) rose from 121 +/- 2 mmHg to 176 +/- 7 mmHg (P less than 0.001) and urinary protein excretion from 0.6 +/- 0.2 to 84 +/- 22 mg/24 h (P less than 0.001). Glomerular mesangial expansion was present after 2 weeks, then progressed, in association with the development of glomerular sclerosis, which became prominent after 6 weeks. Rats were treated with enalapril (5 mg/kg per day) or felodipine (30 mg/kg per day) from 1 week after subtotal nephrectomy, and their course compared with that of untreated rats. Systemic SBP decreased to a similar degree by both drug treatments. Six weeks after surgery, plasma creatinine concentration was lower in the enalapril-treated group (110 +/- 8 mumol/l, P less than 0.05) than in the felodipine-treated group (153 +/- 23 mumol/l). The latter group showed similar plasma creatinine concentrations to those of the untreated rats (173 +/- 19 mumol/l).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "352": "The interaction of salt with hypertension-induced left ventricular hypertrophy and its reversal by inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme were studied in salt sensitive and salt resistant Dahl rats. Eight-week-old rats were fed either a low or high salt diet for three weeks. The colonies were then further divided and either treated with lisinopril or given no treatment for 11 weeks. Untreated salt sensitive rats had higher blood pressures than salt resistant animals. Left ventricular weight and wall thickness in both untreated salt sensitive groups was higher than in the resistant groups. Therapy lowered blood pressures in all groups but those of the high salt group remained higher than the low salt group. Reduction of left ventricular weight and wall thickness took place in either strain only when salt intake was low. Right ventricular and atrial weights were largely unaffected either by salt intake or drug therapy. Plasma renin activity increased and aldosterone levels decreased with lisinopril therapy in all groups except the salt sensitive, high salt group where both remained unchanged at low levels. Lisinopril was effective in reducing blood pressure and left ventricular hypertrophy, but both effects were severely impaired by high salt intake. The major determinant of left ventricular hypertrophy appeared to be afterload, as shown by a good correlation between left ventricular mass and systolic blood pressure, but there was some indication of a possible independent hypertrophic action of salt.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "353": "To provide information on the possible influence that hypertension or its treatment might have on the development of cysts in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, we studied the effects of the sodium content of the diet, DOCA-salt hypertension, renovascular hypertension, and the administration of enalapril or furosemide on the development of 2-amino-4-5-diphenylthiazole (DPT)-induced renal cystic disease. DOCA-salt hypertension caused vascular and glomerular lesions and proteinuria, but it did not enhance the development of cysts. Cytogenesis was enhanced in experimental conditions where the renin-angiotensin system is known to be activated. On the other hand, interventions known to suppress the renin-angiotensin system lessened the development of cysts. We hypothesize that this effect might be mediated by intrarenal angiotensin II and its capacity to promote cell growth and to control the postglomerular vascular resistances and the compliance of the renal interstitium.", 
    "354": "In order to assess whether blood pressure reduction with atenolol or enalapril is associated with changes in renal prostaglandin (PG) synthesis, we studied the effects of 10 weeks therapy in 20 subjects with mild or moderate hypertension. After a four week placebo run-in period, subjects were randomized to receive either atenolol 50-100 mg/day or enalapril 5-20 mg/day for 10 weeks, then crossed over to the alternate active drug. Both drugs lowered blood pressure: placebo 147/97, atenolol 135/87, enalapril 132/87 (p less than 0.05, for both). Atenolol reduced resting heart rate but neither drug changed body weight, serum sodium or potassium or creatinine clearance. Intravenous furosemide was used as a standardized stimulus of renal PG synthesis. Neither drug changed the excretion rates of 6ketoPGF1 alpha or thromboxane B2 (hydrolysis products of PGI2 and thromboxane A2 respectively). Diuretic, kaliuretic, and natriuretic effects of furosemide were also not affected. Plasma renin activity was increased by enalapril but reduced slightly by atenolol. Subjects with more marked blood pressure reduction showed responses to furosemide no different than those with less effect. We conclude that blood pressure reduction with atenolol or enalapril does not change the response of renal eicosanoid synthesis to acute stimulation with furosemide.", 
    "355": "The presence of angiotensinogen messenger RNA (mRNA) was detected in rat vascular and adipose tissue. Angiotensinogen mRNA in rat aorta was localized in the adventitia and surrounding adipose tissue, and not in the vascular smooth muscle. Freshly dispersed and cultured endothelial and aortic smooth muscle cells did not contain detectable amounts of angiotensinogen mRNA. In addition to periaortic adipose tissue, angiotensinogen mRNA was present in other fat depots of both brown and white types. To examine regulation of angiotensinogen gene expression, Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or underwent bilateral nephrectomy. Relative levels of angiotensinogen mRNA in brown adipose tissues increased dramatically by 48 hours after bilateral nephrectomy. However, only one source of brown adipose tissue showed increased angiotensinogen mRNA levels after animals were treated for 5 days with converting enzyme inhibitor. In addition, angiotensinogen was released into the medium from incubated adipose tissues with levels increasing over a 2-hour period. These results demonstrate that angiotensinogen is synthesized by adipose tissue in the rat and may play a role in the function of this tissue.", 
    "356": "A prolonged infusion with ANF (20 micrograms/kg/h for 7 days) induced atrophy of zona glomerulosa cells and lowering of basal plasma concentration of aldosterone in rats whose hypothalamo-hypophyseal-adrenal axis and renin-angiotensin system had been interrupted by the simultaneous administration of dexamethasone/captopril and maintenance doses of ACTH/angiotensin II. Chronic ANF treatment also caused comparable reductions in the aldosterone response of zona glomerulosa cells to the acute stimulation with angiotensin II, potassium and ACTH. These data are interpreted to indicate that ANF exerts an inhibitory effect on the growth and secretory activity of rat zona glomerulosa, and that the mechanism underlying this action of ANF does not involve blockade of renin release or ACTH secretion.", 
    "357": "Changes in angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) derived from plasma, lung, aorta, brain, kidney and testis were measured in rats treated with perindopril. Angiotensin converting enzyme was measured by a radio inhibitor binding method using 125I351A. Rats were gavage fed perindopril (1, 4 and 8 mg/kg) and changes followed over 48 hr. Plasma and kidney ACE were both affected acutely with reduction of 125I351A binding to less than 5% of that in control animals 1 and 2 hr after gavage. Ligand binding to ACE in plasma and kidney returned to control levels after 24 hr. Ligand binding to ACE in lung, aorta and brain also was displaced after perindopril treatment. Changes were of a lesser degree than in plasma or kidney. Maximal effect was 1 to 4 hr after treatment and persisted through 24 hr postgavage. Ligand binding to ACE from testis was little altered over the time period of study. In a dose varying study rats were gavage fed perindopril (0-32 mg/kg) and tissues were studied 4 hr later. Ligand binding to plasma and kidney ACE was displaced by 50% at a dose of 1 mg/kg or less, whereas a dose of 16 to 32 mg/kg was required for a similar effect on ACE in lung, aorta and brain. ACE in testis was only affected to a small degree at a dose of 32 mg/kg. ACE is tissues was inhibited differentially after oral treatment with perindopril. Although differing in bioavailability, bioactivation of the drug or different binding properties of the enzyme could all account for the results, the most likely explanation is that there is variation in tissue penetration of the drug.", 
    "358": "The mechanism(s) of the waning of the vasodilation and increase in vascular permeability during prolonged local intraarterial infusions of bradykinin (BK) was investigated in this study. Treatment with phentolamine or saralasin failed to prevent the waning of the vasodilation during the prolonged infusion of BK into forelimbs perfused at constant flow. In contrast, BK produced a sustained vasodilator response after treatment with captopril. Forelimb weight and lymph analysis were used to quantitate edema formation and to determine the duration of the increase in vascular permeability during prolonged local intra-arterial infusions of BK into forelimbs perfused at constant flow. The lymph-to-plasma ratios (L/P) for protein and FITC-Dextrans (fluorescein isothiocyanate dextrans, 70,000 Da) were determined, and clearances for protein and FITC-D were calculated. BK markedly increased fluid filtration, the protein L/P, and protein clearance resulting in edema formation. The protein L/P remained markedly elevated throughout the experimental period. The FITC-D L/P was markedly increased in the groups of animals in which the tracer was injected intravenously at the start or 8 min after the start of the prolonged BK infusion. In the groups of animals in which the tracer was injected intravenously 15-60 min after the start of the prolonged BK infusion, the FITC-D L/P failed to exceed the FITC-D L/P in control animals, although the protein L/P remained elevated. Pretreatment with both captopril and propranolol dramatically potentiated the magnitude of the increase in protein clearance, the filtration rate, and edema formation produced by BK but failed to affect the duration of the transient increase in vascular permeability.", 
    "359": "To define whether intrarenal renin and angiotensinogen synthesis and distribution are affected by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition, a control group of adult, male Wistar-Kyoto rats (n = 7) was compared with a group of rats treated with enalapril (n = 8) for 5 days. Kidney renin and angiotensinogen mRNA levels were detected by Northern and dot blot analysis, using full-length rat renin and angiotensinogen cDNAs. Renin mRNA levels in the enalapril-treated group were 4.6-fold higher than in the control group (P less than 0.05). Angiotensinogen mRNA levels were not significantly different. The intrarenal distribution of renin assessed by immunocytochemistry was markedly different between the two groups of rats. Whereas in the control kidney renin was localized in a juxtaglomerular position, in the kidneys from enalapril-treated rats, renin immunoreactivity of the afferent arteriole extended well beyond the juxtaglomerular loci in the direction of the interlobular artery. The percent of afferent arteriolar length immunostained for renin was higher in the enalapril-treated (53 +/- 17%) than in the control (33 +/- 15) group. Similarly, the ratio of immunostained juxtaglomerular apparatuses (JGA) over total number of JGA and the ratio of immunostained arteries over total number of arteries were higher in the enalapril-treated (0.84 +/- 0.017; 0.68 +/- 0.03) than in the control (0.67 +/- 0.034; 0.43 +/- 0.045) group (P less than 0.05). We conclude that chronic ACE inhibition enhances intrarenal renin synthesis and increases renin expression upstream from the glomerulus and in new sites in blood vessels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "360": "Nineteen essential hypertensive patients were entered into a protocol to assess the BP, humoral and renal effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, lisinopril (MK 521, 20 to 80 mg once daily), administered for 52 weeks. Specifically monitored prior to, and following 12 and 52 weeks of lisinopril monotherapy were plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone, the clearances of creatinine, inulin and para-aminohippurate, and the 24-hour urinary excretion of protein. BP was well controlled. Plasma renin activity was stimulated, and plasma aldosterone was suppressed throughout the entire protocol. In contrast to the reported short-term and long-term renal effects of enalapril, lisinopril (a lysine analog of enalapril) had no short-term effect on renal function: glomerular filtration rate, effective renal plasma flow, filtration fraction (FF), renal vascular resistance (RVR), and protein excretion were all unchanged. However, following long-term therapy, both FF and RVR were decreased. Lisinopril appears to convey no specific renal pharmacological benefit.", 
    "361": "Analogues of captopril, enalaprilat, and the phosphinic acid [hydroxy(4-phenylbutyl)phosphinyl]acetyl]-L-proline incorporating 4-substituted proline derivatives have been synthesized and evaluated as inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in vitro and in vivo. The 4-substituted prolines, incorporating alkyl, aryl, alkoxy, aryloxy, alkylthio, and arylthio substituents were prepared from derivatives of 4-hydroxy- and 4-ketoproline. In general, analogues of all three classes of inhibitors with hydrophobic substituents on proline were more potent in vitro than the corresponding unsubstituted proline compounds. 4-Substituted analogues of captopril showed greater potency and duration of action than the parent compound as inhibitors of the angiotensin I induced pressor response in normotensive rats. The S-benzoyl derivative of cis-4-(phenylthio)captopril, zofenopril, was found to be one of the most potent compounds of this class and is now being evaluated clinically as an antihypertensive agent. In the phosphinic acid series, the 4-ethylenethioketal and trans-4-cyclohexyl derivatives were found to be the most potent compounds in vitro and in vivo. A prodrug of the latter compound, fosinopril, is also being evaluated in clinical trials.", 
    "362": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme was shown to be present in retinal vessels and neural retina of feline, bovine, and human eyes. It was also demonstrated in the other ocular tissues of feline eyes, in especially high concentration in the highly vascular uveal layer. Its role in the physiology of ocular blood flow and neurophysiology is uncertain, especially in the retina where circulating angiotensin and bradykinin are confined to the intravascular space by the blood-retina barrier, and sufficient data are not available to describe these peptides as transmitters or modulator molecules in the retina.", 
    "363": "The angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitors available so far are active-site directed inhibitors. They utilize all the critical binding interactions of the substrate and convert the catalytic interaction with the zinc atom into an effective binding interaction. Three chemical classes of angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitors have been introduced into clinical use, the sulfhydryl-containing inhibitors such as captopril and its analogs and prodrugs, carboxyalkyldipeptides such as enalapril and its analogs, and phosphorus-containing inhibitors such as fosinopril and the phosphonate SQ 29,852. Within each of the three groups of inhibitors significant differences in molecular weight and polarities can be observed. These differences have a significant influence in the routes of elmination and tissue distribution of these inhibitors. Tissue distribution and intrinsic potency will determine the magnitude of angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibition at the tissue level, which could play a critical role in the clinical utilization of these inhibitors. The sulfhydryl-containing inhibitors such as captopril undergo a metabolic process significantly different from that of the other two classes. They can interact with endogenous sulfhydryl-containing compounds like glutathione and proteins, to form reversible disulfides, which can serve as depot forms of the drug. Also, because of their redox properties they might function as recyclable free radical scavengers.", 
    "364": "The existence of a brain renin-angiotensin system (RAS) as one of various tissue RASs is now firmly established. Angiotensin-containing pathways within brain areas involved in central blood pressure regulation have been described. Evidence from biochemical, neurophysiologic, pharmacologic, and most recently, molecular genetic studies indicate that the brain RAS is regulated independently of the hormonal RAS and may contribute to blood pressure control and body fluid homeostasis. In addition, circulating angiotensin II can exert some of its action through stimulation of brain angiotensin receptors accessible from the blood. In experimental animal preparations of hypertension, especially in spontaneously hypertensive rats, an overactive brain RAS may be one of the factors involved in pathogenesis and maintenance of hypertension. In spontaneously hypertensive rats, inhibitors of the angiotensin II-generating converting enzyme (CE) have been shown to lower blood pressure by a central action when applied to the brain and to inhibit brain CE when applied systemically. The pathogenetic mechanisms underlying a particular cardiovascular disease and the characteristics of the CE inhibitor used (e.g., its lipid solubility governing penetration into tissue) may determine the degree to which CE inhibition within a given organ, such as the brain, contributes to the action of these drugs.", 
    "365": "The abilities of angiotensin converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors to suppress superoxide anion formation in vitro and to improve postischemic cardiac function in vivo were examined. Three sulfhydryl-containing ACE inhibitors, captopril, its stereoisomer SQ 14,534, and an analog, zofenopril (SQ 26,703) were compared with enalaprilat and teprotide, which lack the sulfhydryl group but inhibit ACE, and two compounds, N-2-mercaptopropionylglycine (MPG) and N-acetylcysteine (NAC), which contain a thiol moiety but are not ACE inhibitors, for suppression of free radical formation in vitro. The autooxidation of epinephrine to adrenochrome is mediated by superoxide anions and inhibited by captopril, SQ 14,534, and zofenopril, with similar IC50 values of 8 to 10 microM, but not by enalaprilat or teprotide (IC50 greater than 1000 microM). This reaction is also inhibited by MPG and NAC with IC50 values of 19 and 17 microM, respectively. In addition, captopril, MPG, or NAC, but not teprotide or enalaprilat, scavenge superoxide anion production by the purine-xanthine oxidase reaction and by canine neutrophils activated with phorbol myristate acetate. These results indicate that captopril scavenges superoxide anions in vitro independent of an action on ACE, which is probably related to the presence of a sulfhydryl moiety. Myocardial segmental function in the anesthetized, open-chest dog is altered during ischemia from active shortening to passive lengthening. Reperfusion after 15 min of ischemia does not restore active shortening within a 3 hr experimental period. Pretreatment of dogs with captopril intravenously (5 mg/kg) results in a 40% to 60% return to active shortening within 60 min of reperfusion. In contrast, equihypotensive doses of enalaprilat do not improve segmental function during reperfusion. Dogs given captopril immediately before restoring coronary blood flow show a similar return of function as that observed in animals treated with the drug before occlusion. SQ 14,534, the isomer of captopril, which is 100-fold less potent as an ACE inhibitor but equipotent in scavenging superoxide anions, also improves reperfusion-induced cardiac dysfunction when administered at reperfusion (5 mg/kg). Thus captopril improves postischemic contractile derangements by a mechanism independent of ACE inhibition. Restoration of blood supply to the ischemic myocardium provokes ventricular fibrillation in 37.5% of control dogs but in only 9% of those administered enalaprilat and 0% of captopril-treated animals. SQ 14,534 does not reduce the incidence of ventricular fibrillation (40%), indicating that the antifibrillatory actions may be related to ACE inhibition.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "366": "The blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and humoral effects of single intravenous (i.v.) doses of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril was investigated in five normotensive healthy volunteers. Each subject received at 1-week intervals a bolus dose of either captopril (1, 5, and 25 mg) or its vehicle. The study was conducted in a single-blind fashion, and the order of treatment phases was randomized. The different doses of captopril had no acute effect on BP and HR. They induced a dose-dependent decrease in plasma ACE activity and plasma angiotensin II levels. The angiotensin-(1-8) octapeptide was isolated by solid-phase extraction and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) prior to radioimmunoassay (RIA). All three doses of captopril reduced circulating angiotensin II levels within 15 min of drug administration. Only with the 25-mg dose was the angiotensin II concentration below the detection limit at 15 min and still significantly reduced 90 min after drug administration. Simultaneous and progressive decreases in plasma aldosterone levels were observed both with ACE inhibition and during vehicle injection, but the relative fall was more pronounced after captopril administration. No adverse reaction was noticed. These results demonstrate that captopril given parenterally blocks the renin-angiotensin system in a dose-dependent manner. Only with the dose of 25 mg was the inhibition of plasma-converting enzyme activity and the reduction of plasma angiotensin II sustained for at least 1 1/2 h.", 
    "367": "In previous studies, we found that spontaneously hypertensive rats (Okamoto-Aoki SHRs) suffer progressive postnatal dilation of the brain ventricles. In the present study we examined intracerebroventricular pressure and blood pressure as possible mechanisms of ventricular dilation in SHRs. We found that intracerebroventricular pressure was not elevated in SHRs. The role of blood pressure was examined in SHRs treated chronically with the antihypertensive drug, captopril, beginning in utero, and in renal hypertensive Sprague-Dawley rats (SDs). Although our experimental treatments produced significant changes in mean arterial pressures, they did not alter brain ventricular size: SDs with experimental hypertension had normal-sized brain ventricles and SHRs with pharmacologically reduced blood pressure had enlarged ventricles. These results suggest that neither increased intraventricular pressure nor high blood pressure is the sole cause of hydrocephalus in SHRs.", 
    "368": "Prodrugs are pharmacologically inert and nontoxic chemical compounds which are transformed in vivo into pharmacologically and therapeutically active compounds, i.e. drugs. Prodrugs are used to solve problems which cannot be solved by the drugs themselves. There are three types of problems: problems arising before the drug enters the body (solubilization, stabilization and improved acceptability); problems associated with the penetration and fate of the drug in the body (absorption, barrier crossing, duration of action); problems relating to the therapeutic target (selective local delivery). The principal prodrugs that solve these problems and the mechanisms of the solutions they provide are described and discussed.", 
    "369": "Deterioration in renal function after the use of angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitors may be the first clue to the presence of bilateral renal arterial stenosis. In order to avoid serious threat to the patient, early detection of the insidious decline in renal function is necessary and depends on routine biochemical monitoring after the initiation of therapy. Six cases are described here, to illustrate the very real danger of this class of drugs in this chemical setting; the grave risk of their combination with potassium-sparing diuretic agents is highlighted.", 
    "370": "The present study evaluates the inter-relationship between the alteration in atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) and the renal handling of Na in rats with chronic aortocaval (a-v) fistula, an experimental model of congestive heart failure. Balance studies in these animals showed two distinct patterns of Na excretion: some rats developed progressive Na retention [urinary sodium excretion (UNaV) less than 100 mueq/24 h], whereas others compensated and returned to normal Na balance (UNaV greater than 1,200 mueq/24 h). Base-line plasma ANF levels were equally elevated in Na-retaining and compensated rats with a-v fistula (588 +/- 70 vs. 621 +/- 114 pg/ml, P, NS). However, the response of the two groups to exogenous administration of synthetic rat ANF-(101-126) in incremental doses varied greatly. ANF infusion increased the fractional Na excretion (FENa) in compensated animals from 0.12 +/- 0.03 to 2.6 +/- 0.5%, whereas the rise in FENa in Na-retaining animals was markedly blunted (0.11 +/- 0.06 to 0.89 +/- 0.35%). A similar pattern of ANF action was observed on the glomerular filtration rate and urine flow. The blunted response to ANF in the Na-retaining animals was associated with a marked increase in plasma renin activity (PRA) (35.6 +/- 6.9 vs. 4.5 +/- 0.7 ng ANG I.ml-1.h-1 in sham control rats, P less than 0.05) and plasma aldosterone levels (729.3 +/- 28.2 vs. 42.6 +/- 18.4 ng/dl in sham control rats, P less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "371": "Experimental inflammation was induced by injection of a suspension of kaolin in carboxymethylcellulose solution into a subcutaneous air pouch preformed on the back of rats. Endogenous bradykinin generated in the inflammatory pouch declined quickly unless kininase inhibitors were administered into the pouch. Bradykinin injected into the pouch brought about no significant increase in plasma exudation in the pouch unless kininase inhibitors were administered simultaneously. Although kininase I and II activities were present in normal rat serum, kininase II rather than kininase I was mainly responsible for the degradation of bradykinin in rat serum. In the pouch challenged with the kaolin suspension and vehicle, kininase II originating from the pouch wall tissue played a predominant role in the degradation of bradykinin while the role of kininases derived from the blood and inflammatory cells was minor.", 
    "372": "In 67 patients thought to have renovascular hypertension, plasma renin activity was measured in both renal veins and peripherally (common femoral v.) before and after administration of 25 mg captopril. Other antihypertensive medication, except diuretics and ACE inhibitors, had been discontinued. The renin ratio, renin secretion indices before and after ACE inhibition, as well as the percentage rise in peripheral plasma renin activity, after captopril were calculated from the measured data. The diagnostic and prognostic value of the various calculation models were compared on the basis of blood pressure changes in 29 patients after intervention (28 operations, one percutaneous transluminal angioplasty). Of the various calculations the renin ratio after ACE stimulation--measuring plasma renin activity separately for each side--was of the greatest value in discriminating for renovascular hypertension (sensitivity 89%, specificity 100%). Comparable results in the discrimination for renovascular hypertension were achieved by determining the rise in peripheral plasma renin activity after captopril. This method is, therefore, a simple, noninvasive test for diagnosing renovascular hypertension with great accuracy even while existing medication is being continued.", 
    "373": "The biotransformation of di-acid angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (I) to cyclized lactam metabolites was studied in the urine of rats using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Chemical synthesis of the corresponding piperazine-dione metabolite (III) was achieved by reaction of enalapril, perindopril or ramipril with acetic acid anhydride followed by hydrolysis of the ester group by sodium in ethanol or by acid hydrolysis. Electron impact and chemical ionization mass spectra confirmed the structure of these potential novel metabolites. Selected ion monitoring of urinary extracts demonstrated small amounts (less than 5%) of these lactams for all three inhibitors, however, it was shown that the majority of these lactams were formed as a result of sample treatment rather than due to biotransformation.", 
    "374": "Regarding 5 recent cases of cough induced by inhibitors of angiotensin conversion enzyme (CEI), the authors emphasize the still underestimated frequency of this annoying and sometimes disabling side-effect (10 to 15% of cases). They remind of their clinical and evolutive characteristics: dry cough, predominantly at night, often occurring rapidly, sometimes delayed (up to 17 months) after introduction of the CEI and unrelated to the dosage. The cough usually disappears in two to three days (up to 8 days) upon discontinuation of the treatment. The test of discontinuation-reintroduction, possibly crossed (captopril/enalapril) is used in questionable cases as a diagnostic test. Besides, this diagnosis must be made rapidly in order to avoid costly, unnecessary laboratory tests which are sometimes unpleasant for the patient. The cough could be explained by an irritation of the bronchial mucosa secondary to bradykinin and pulmonary E2 prostaglandins elevation, under CEI.", 
    "375": "This study assessed the contribution of angiotensin II, oxygen-free radicals, and vasopressin to the mortality of acute mesenteric ischemia in rats. Rats received saline replacement (16 ml/kg/hr) for 3 hr during and after 85 min of superior mesenteric artery (SMA) occlusion. Only 21% of rats that received saline alone (n = 14, control) survived 48 hr, significantly less than the 100% survival of sham-operated rats (no SMA occlusion, n = 5, P less than 0.01). Neither teprotide (an angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitor), allopurinol (to reduce oxygen-free radical formation), nor a specific vasopressin antagonist [1-(beta-mercapto-beta,beta-cyclopentamethyleneproprionic acid), 2-(O-methyl) tyrosine arginine-vasopressin] improved 48-hr survival, which was 17% in each group (n = 6, each). Survival improved significantly to 86% (n = 7, P less than 0.001) when intravenous glucagon (1.6 micrograms/kg/min) was given for 2 hr after SMA reperfusion. Survival after dopamine infusion (12 micrograms/kg/min iv) was 67% at 48 hr, a nearly significant improvement (n = 9, P less than 0.06). These results suggest that angiotensin II, oxygen-free radicals, and vasopressin do not contribute significantly to the high mortality observed after acute intestinal ischemia in this rat model, but that glucagon, and to a lesser extent, dopamine, are potentially therapeutic.", 
    "376": "The role of plasma angiotensin II (Ang II) in furosemide-stimulated renal prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production was evaluated in eight healthy subjects. Urine was collected for 60 minutes after furosemide administration (20 mg i.v.) with or without captopril pretreatment, and urinary excretion of PGE2, sodium, and furosemide was determined. Plasma renin activity (PRA) and Ang II were also measured before and 60 minutes after furosemide administration. Urinary PGE2 excretion, PRA, and Ang II increased after furosemide administration without captopril pretreatment, and there was a significant correlation between the increment in Ang II and that in urinary PGE2 excretion. Urinary PGE2 excretion and Ang II did not increase after furosemide administration with captopril pretreatment. Urine volume and urinary excretion of sodium and furosemide were not influenced by captopril pretreatment. These results suggest that Ang II may play an important role in furosemide-stimulated PGE2 production.", 
    "377": "We investigated the status of circulating kinins in rats with severe hypertension caused by drinking 1% NaCl (saline) and treatment with deoxycorticosterone (DOC, 25 mg/kg/wk s.c.) for 5 weeks. Saline-drinking rats treated with DOC had a higher systolic blood pressure (210 +/- 4 mm Hg) than did rats without DOC treatment drinking water (138 +/- 3 mm Hg) or saline (141 +/- 3 mm Hg). The concentration of kinins in the inferior vena cava plasma of DOC-salt hypertensive rats did not differ from the venous plasma kinin concentration in normotensive rats drinking water or saline. In contrast, the arterial plasma kinin concentration in DOC-salt hypertensive rats (7.0 +/- 0.8 pg/ml) was lower (p less than 0.002) than that in water-drinking controls (14.0 +/- 2.2 pg/ml); it also was lower (p less than 0.005) in saline-drinking rats (8.1 +/- 0.9 pg/ml) than in water-drinking controls. Infusion of bradykinin (20 micrograms/kg/min i.v.) increased arterial plasma kinins in all the groups. Nonetheless, the arterial plasma kinin concentration achieved during bradykinin infusion in DOC-salt hypertensive (1590 +/- 130 pg/ml) and in saline-drinking rats (1540 +/- 100 pg/ml) was lower than that in water-drinking rats (2140 +/- 210 pg/ml). On the other hand, during infusion of the kininase II inhibitor captopril (80 micrograms/hr i.p.) for 3 days, neither DOC-salt hypertensive rats nor saline-drinking normotensive rats exhibited significant reduction of arterial plasma kinins relative to the level in water-drinking controls. These data indicate that high salt intake, irrespective of the level of blood pressure, causes the arterial plasma concentration of kinins to fall.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "378": "The effect of arginine vasopressin (AVP) pressor blockade on the response to graded hemorrhage was investigated on conscious, unstressed, freely moving rats. The parameters studied were mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), blood velocity in the ascending aorta (ABV), and plasma concentrations of AVP (pAVP), renin (PRC), corticosterone (pCS), and catecholamines. After the first hemorrhage (0.75% of body wt over 5 min), MAP remained unchanged while ABV declined and HR increased. The two subsequent hemorrhages brought about significant reduction in MAP, HR, and ABV. pAVP, pCS, and PRC increased gradually during the experiment, while plasma catecholamine levels remained unchanged except for epinephrine, which increased after the third hemorrhage. After pretreatment with the AVP-pressor antagonist, [d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)]AVP, the hemorrhage-induced cardiovascular changes were practically identical to those seen in control animals. Results with AVP blockade performed after the third hemorrhage were also negative. A pressor role of AVP after hypotensive hemorrhage could only be revealed in the presence of converting-enzyme inhibition and alpha-adrenergic blockade. In addition, [d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)]AVP did not modify the effect of hemorrhage on pCS and catecholamines and caused only a slight enhancement of the increase in PRC. It is concluded that conscious, nonstressed rats, if all compensatory mechanisms are allowed full expression, exhibit a normal cardiovascular compensatory response to hemorrhage in the absence of functional AVP pressor receptors.", 
    "379": "To evaluate the hypothesis that sodium depletion produces a chronic increase in renal nerve activity, arterial and renal venous plasma norepinephrine (NE) concentrations were measured in conscious dogs subjected to various degrees of sodium depletion. After 9 days of sodium depletion (LS), there was a net loss of 69 +/- 10 meq sodium, and mean arterial pressure (MAP) was reduced from 94 +/- 5 to 88 +/- 4 mmHg. At this time plasma renin activity (PRA) was increased from a control level (sodium intake = 45 meq/day) of 0.34 +/- 0.08 to 1.47 +/- 0.26 ng angiotensin I (ANG I).ml-1.h-1 in association with an approximately sixfold increase in the PRA gradient across the kidneys. Subsequently, when captopril was infused during an additional 7 days of sodium deprivation [(LS + converting enzyme inhibitor CEI)], there was further sodium depletion (31 +/- 11 meq) and hypotension (MAP = 65 +/- 6 mmHg) and PRA and the renal PRA gradient increased even further. In marked contrast, there were no significant changes in either arterial plasma NE concentration (control = 102 +/- 5 pg/ml) or the renal arteriovenous gradient of plasma NE concentration during either LS or LS + CEI. These experiments show a distinct disparity between changes in the PRA and the plasma NE concentration gradient across the kidneys during LS and fail to support the contention that increased renal nerve activity is an important long-term adaptive response to sodium depletion.", 
    "380": "A retrospective study of nine sick premature infants with chronic lung disease who received captopril for control of systemic hypertension (systolic blood pressure (BP) greater than 113 mm Hg) was carried out to determine efficacy of therapy and associated complications. All nine infants had markedly elevated peripheral renin values, 134.3 +/- 128.1 ng/mL/hr (mean +/- SD). Five infants had abnormal renal sonographic and perfusion scans with evidence of renal artery thrombosis, parenchymal disease, or both. Captopril therapy (0.3 mg/kg) was instituted at a postnatal age of 123 +/- 108 days. After the initial dose, the systolic BP decreased significantly in all infants, the decrease ranging from 21% to 58% of the pretreatment value. Dosage was subsequently halved in all infants. Seventeen episodes of unpredictable decreases in BP more than 40% from baseline occurred during the reduced maintenance therapy. Four infants had a total of seven episodes during which the BP decreased by 57 +/- 10% from baseline; this decrease persisted for 17 +/- 6 hours and was unresponsive to volume reexpansion and inotropic therapy. All seven episodes were accompanied by oliguria (urine output less than 1 mL/kg/hr) that persisted for 18 +/- 12 hours. These episodes were accompanied by neurologic signs (subtle seizures, lethargy, and/or apnea) within 18 +/- 6 hours after the onset of oliguria. The remaining five infants had a total of 13 episodes of decreased BP of 50 +/- 8% of baseline, which were of significantly shorter duration and responded to volume reexpanders, inotropic therapy, or both and were unaccompanied by oliguria. These data suggest the need for close observation of BP in infants receiving maintenance captopril therapy.", 
    "381": "Therapy combining vasodilators and inotropic agents is considered to be one of the most powerful means of improving cardiac function in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). The vasodilators enhance the effectiveness of inotropic agents by providing a reduction in preload and/or afterload. Inotropic drugs with different mechanisms of action, such as digitalis glycosides, ephedrine, dopamine, dobutamine, ibopamine, terbutaline, salbutamol, pirbuterol, prenalterol, amrinone, and milrinone, have been tested in combination with vasodilators with a predominant effect on preload (nitrates, molsidomine), with a predominant effect on afterload (hydralazine, nifedipine), or with a balanced action on both arterial and venous beds (nitroprusside, prazosin, captopril), showing positive results. The problem of the combination of digitalis glycosides and vasodilators with different sites of action has been considered by our group. In 42 patients with CHF, digoxin (DIG, 0.01 mg/kg intravenously) was tested in combination with molsidomine (MLS, 4 mg sublingually) (12 patients), a nitrate-like agent with a predominant vasodilating action on the capacitance vessels, nifedipine (NFP, 10 mg sublingually) (22 patients), a Ca2+ antagonist drug with a predominant action on the resistance vessels, and captopril (CPT, 25 mg orally) (8 patients), an ACE inhibitor with a balanced effect on both preload and afterload. The combination DIG plus MLS caused a reduction in left ventricular filling pressure (LVFP) greater than that achieved with either agent alone. The hemodynamic improvement was obtained without side effects, in spite of the striking fall in preload. We stress that this investigation was performed on patients with CHF following acute myocardial infarction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "382": "The response of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) to standing and the acute and chronic administration of the vasodilator, captopril, were examined in 15 patients with chronic congestive heart failure. In the supine position, ANP was increased (361 +/- 202 pg/ml); however, only a loose correlation existed between atrial pressures and ANP (right atrial vs ANP, r = 0.03, p = N.S., and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures vs ANP, r = 0.4, p = N.S.). Standing and acute captopril therapy decreased atrial pressures and ANP but did not significantly improve the correlation between atrial pressures and ANP. With chronic captopril therapy, atrial pressures remained decreased; however, ANP had returned to control values (370 +/- 254 pg/ml vs 361 +/- 202 pg/ml) and failed to decrease with standing (370 +/- 259 pg/ml lying vs 351 +/- 194 pg/ml standing). These changes in ANP (with chronic captopril therapy) persisted even once the hemodynamic effects of captopril had dissipated (3 hours post dose). This study indicates that in patients with severe chronic congestive heart failure (1) only a poor correlation exists between ANP and atrial pressures and (2) with chronic captopril therapy ANP increases to higher levels for a given atrial pressure and fails to decrease with standing despite a decrease in atrial pressures.", 
    "383": "Enalaprilat, the active metabolite of enalapril, and its lysine analogue lisinopril are potent nonsulfhydryl angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Earlier studies from our laboratories demonstrated that neither drug is significantly metabolized, and both are almost exclusively eliminated by renal excretion. This report compares the renal excretory mechanisms for these structurally related compounds in the rat. After an iv, 1-mg/kg dose, ratios of renal clearance (CLR) of unbound drug to glomerular filtration rate (GFR) for enalaprilat and lisinopril were 2.72 +/- 0.70 and 1.01 +/- 0.18, respectively, suggesting that enalaprilat, but not lisinopril, was actively secreted by the kidneys. Treatment with probenecid and p-aminohippuric acid, potent competitive inhibitors for the renal anionic transport system, caused a profound decrease in the renal clearance of enalaprilat to the level of GFR. The CLR/fu.GFR, where fu is the unbound fraction, became 1.10 +/- 0.09 and 1.25 +/- 0.25, respectively. These results and the fact that quinine, a potent inhibitor for the cationic transport system, had little effect on the renal clearance of enalaprilat indicated that enalaprilat is secreted by the organic anion transport system. On the other hand, probenecid, p-aminohippuric acid, and quinine had no effect on the renal clearance of lisinopril, suggesting that lisinopril is eliminated exclusively by glomerular filtration."
