We included 297 patients in our trial, aged 54.65+/-9.6 years, with treated or untreated hypertension and with high risk of cardiac events, in an opened trial of therapy based on lisinopril plus hydrochlorothiazide. Patients from five European countries were followed up for a period of 12 weeks. Duration of treatment was 12 weeks. We adjusted daily doses of lisinopril plus hydrochlorothiazide after every clinical examination and recorded adverse effects of drugs. In the beginning and after 12 weeks of treatment, 277 patients (93.2%) underwent 2-dimensional echocardiography and there were 186 patients evaluated for efficacy of treatment on left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). We recorded a regression of index mass LVH (168.56 vs 161.51 g/m2, P<0.0001), and regression was something more in women vs men. We recorded average reduction of left ventricular mass index for patients with LVH (N=186) by 7.05 g/m2 (4.18%) in all patients, by 6.73 g/m2 (3.93%) in men and 7.27 g/m2 (4,37%) in women. The proportion of patients who attained a regression of left ventricular mass tended to be greater in men (54.55% vs 53.21%). This research has proved regression of LVH in more than 53% patients after using fixed combination of lisinopril plus hydrochlorothiazide.", 
    "1": "The blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is helpful in the management of arterial hypertension, congestive heart failure, post-myocardial infarction and diabetic nephropathy. Such blockade can be obtained with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, a specific antagonist of angiotensin II AT1 receptors, an aldosterone receptor antagonist and/or a direct inhibitor of renin such as aliskiren. Various studies have demonstrated that a dual or even triple RAAS inhibition may offer a better cardiorenal protection, in refractory congestive heart failure and in nephropathy with proteinuria. However, in the ONTARGET study, the dual inhibition with ramipril plus telmisartan did not provide any additional benefit compared to ramipril alone in high-risk cardiovascular patients, but showed a worse tolerance profile.", 
    "2": "A 2-year-old boy was presented with late-recognized coarctation of the aorta and pulmonary hypertension due to left ventricular failure. The coarctation was corrected at the day of admission with a good postoperative result. However, weaning from the respirator failed despite multiple drug support due to left ventricular failure. Consequently, a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) was implanted 22 days later. The further course was complicated by systemic hypertension and ongoing pulmonary hypertension requiring extensive antihypertensive therapy. The first attempt to wean from LVAD failed and the left ventricle was left completely unloaded for additional 4 weeks. The second weaning attempt, using a very smooth weaning protocol, led to a recovered left ventricle and facilitated the removal of the assist device after a total of 120 days. The patient was discharged with normal cardiac function, but he still requires antihypertensive therapy. We believe that the slow reduction of the LVAD support was the key measure that leads to the successful weaning of the patient, thereby avoiding heart transplantation.",

The rats were treated with 10 mg/kg.d by gastric gavage in the enalapril treated group from 24 h before the operation, and the rats were treated with the identical dose of normal saline in the other 2 groups. The rats were sacrificed at 3,7,14, and 21 days after UUO.

In-hospital mortality was higher in elderly patients (2.4% vs. 3.4% vs. 8.9% vs. 14.0%, respectively for age groups, p < 0.0001). Similarly, in non-shock patients and in patients with elevated cardiac markers, age-dependent differences in mortality were observed. Independent predictors of in-hospital death were: age, cardiogenic shock, elevated cardiac markers and pharmacotherapy index.",

    "15": "In this study, collagen extracted from chicken legs (which are the yellow keratin parts containing a nail) was hydrolyzed with various enzymes, and the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity of each hydrolysate was determined. The hydrolysate by treatment with an Aspergillus species-derived enzyme had the highest activity (IC 50 = 260 microg/mL). The fraction of this hydrolysate obtained by ultrafiltration with a molecular-weight cutoff of 3000 Da (low fraction) had a stronger activity (IC 50 = 130 microg/mL) than the fractionated one. This fraction was further fractionated by HPLC, and the peptides in the fraction with high ACE-inhibitory activity were identified. The amino acid sequences of the four peptides were identified using a protein sequencer. These peptides were synthesized to confirm their ACE-inhibitory activities; this showed that peptides with a Gly-Ala-Hyp-Gly-Leu-Hyp-Gly-Pro sequence had the highest activity (IC 50 = 29 microM). When the low fraction was administered to spontaneous hypertensive rats, a decrease in their blood pressure was observed after 2 h of administration, and a significant decrease in blood pressure (-50 mmHg) was observed after 6 h. Moreover, long-term administration studies indicated that the low fraction showed a significant suppression of increased blood pressure.",

Adequate levels were attained in 13% for fasting glucose, 45% for blood pressure, 71% for albuminuria, and 30% for lipids. Nephropathy was diagnosed in 41%. Adequate systolic blood pressure was observed in 40% of patients with nephropathy vs. 49% without nephropathy (p = 0.03). In both groups, body mass index was acceptable in one fifth of patients, and waist circumference in two thirds of men and one third of women (p = NS). Patients with nephropathy used more antihypertensives, particularly angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (nephropathy 49% vs. no nephropathy 38%, p = 0.004). Subjects with nephropathy received more frequently (p = 0.05) insulin (11%) than those without nephropathy (7%).

    "20": "Diastolic heart failure is characterized by the symptoms and signs of heart failure, a preserved ejection fraction and abnormal left ventricular (LV) diastolic function caused by a decreased LV compliance and relaxation. The signs and symptoms of diastolic heart failure are indistinguishable from those of heart failure related to systolic dysfunction; therefore, the diagnosis of diastolic heart failure is often one of exclusion. The majority of patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction have a history of hypertension. Hypertension induces a compensatory thickening of the ventricular wall in an attempt to normalize wall stress, which results in LV concentric hypertrophy, which in turn decreases LV compliance and LV diastolic filling. There is an abnormal accumulation of fibrillar collagen accompanying the hypertension-induced LV hypertrophy, which is also associated with decreased compliance and LV diastolic dysfunction. There are no specific guidelines for treating diastolic heart failure, but pharmacological treatment should be directed at normalizing blood pressure, promoting regression of LV hypertrophy, preventing tachycardia and treating symptoms of congestion. Preventive strategies directed toward an early and aggressive blood pressure control are likely to offer the greatest promise for reducing the incidence of diastolic heart failure.", 
    "21": "The metabolic syndrome considerably increases the risk of cardiovascular and renal events in hypertension. It has been associated with a wide range of classical and new cardiovascular risk factors as well as with early signs of subclinical cardiovascular and renal damage. Obesity and insulin resistance, beside a constellation of independent factors, which include molecules of hepatic, vascular, and immunologic origin with proinflammatory properties, have been implicated in the pathogenesis. The close relationships among the different components of the syndrome and their associated disturbances make it difficult to understand what the underlying causes and consequences are. At each of these key points, insulin resistance and obesity/proinflammatory molecules, interaction of demographics, lifestyle, genetic factors, and environmental fetal programming results in the final phenotype. High prevalence of end-organ damage and poor prognosis has been demonstrated in a large number of cross-sectional and a few number of prospective studies. The objective of treatment is both to reduce the high risk of a cardiovascular or a renal event and to prevent the much greater chance that metabolic syndrome patients have to develop type 2 diabetes or hypertension. Treatment consists in the opposition to the underlying mechanisms of the metabolic syndrome, adopting lifestyle interventions that effectively reduce visceral obesity with or without the use of drugs that oppose the development of insulin resistance or body weight gain. Treatment of the individual components of the syndrome is also necessary. Concerning blood pressure control, it should be based on lifestyle changes, diet, and physical exercise, which allows for weight reduction and improves muscular blood flow. When antihypertensive drugs are necessary, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II-AT1 receptor blockers, or even calcium channel blockers are preferable over diuretics and classical beta-blockers in monotherapy, if no compelling indications are present for its use. If a combination of drugs is required, low-dose diuretics can be used. A combination of thiazide diuretics and beta-blockers should be avoided.", 
    "22": "To evaluate the mechanisms and the impact of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril (P) in a model of doxorubicin (D)-induced cardiotoxicity, male Wistar rats received D (1 mg/kg/d, IP for 10 days), P (2 mg/kg/d by gavage from day 1 to day 18), D (for 10 days) + P (for 18 days) or saline. D decreased systolic blood pressure and body and heart weights. Left ventricular diastolic diameter was increased by D (P < 0.01), but it was not attenuated by P. D decreased plasma vitamin C (P < 0.05) and increased the ascorbyl radical/vitamin C ratio (P < 0.01). This ratio was attenuated by P. No difference was found among groups in cardiac troponin I, brain natriuretic peptide concentrations, and tissue oxidative stress (OS). Myocardial MCP-1 expression was higher in the D group. Cardiac kinin receptor (B1R and B2R) expression was not affected by D, yet binding sites for B2R and B1R were increased in D+P and P groups, respectively (P < 0.05). In conclusion, D induced cardiac functional alterations, inflammation and plasma OS whereas tissue OS, and cardiac kinin receptors expression were not modified. P did not improve cardiac performance, but it modulated kinin receptor expression and enhanced antioxidant defense.", 
    "23": "Increased activation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) enzyme has been implicated in the pathogenesis of acute and chronic myocardial dysfunction. We have demonstrated the protective effect of PARP inhibitors against postinfarction myocardial remodeling and heart failure. The primary aim of our recent work was to compare the effect and efficacy of a potent PARP-inhibitor (L-2286) to enalapril, a widely used angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. in experimental heart failure model. Both L-2286 and enalapril were tested in a rat model of chronic heart failure after isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction. After a 12-week treatment period, echocardiography was performed, cardiac hypertrophy and interstitial collagen deposition were assessed, and the phosphorylation state of Akt-1/GSK-3beta pathway as well as the PKC and MAPK kinases were determined. Both PARP and ACE inhibition reduced the progression of postinfarction heart failure by attenuating cardiac hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis. More importantly, PARP inhibition increased the activity of the prosurvival signal transduction factors (Akt-1/GSK-3beta pathway, PKCepsilon). Due to these effects, L-2286 improved the systolic left ventricular function. Enalapril treatment exerted a similar, but weaker protective effect against postinfarction myocardial remodeling and heart failure. In conclusion, we demonstrated in an experimental heart failure model that L-2286 decreased the postinfarction myocardial remodeling more effectively than enalapril treatment.", 
    "24": "In a prospective study of 499 patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) hospitalized for coronary angiography, the prevalence of use of cardiovascular drugs at hospital admission was 80% for antiplatelet drugs, 66% for beta blockers, 55% for angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), 65% for lipid-lowering drugs, 24% for calcium channel blockers (CCBs), and 16% for nitrates. In 357 patients with obstructive CAD diagnosed by coronary angiography, the prevalence of use of these drugs at hospital discharge was 100% for antiplatelet drugs, 97% for beta blockers, 91% for ACE inhibitors or ARBs, 98% for lipid-lowering drugs, 17% for CCBs, and 27% for nitrates. Obstructive CAD was significantly more prevalent in men (P < 0.025), in cigarette smokers (P < 0.01), and in patients with hypertension, diabetes, or hypercholesterolemia (P < 0.001). Age, race, body mass index, and neck circumference were not significantly different for patients with versus without obstructive CAD.", 
    "25": "Hypertension is a highly prevalent disease and a strong risk factor for cardiovascular disease in industrialized countries in Europe and North America. About 40-50% of hypertensive patients have some other cardiovascular risk factors as smoking, dyslipidemia, glucose intolerance, metabolic syndrome and diabetes. The realization of optimal therapy of these patients is a difficult task, and reaching target blood pressure values is almost impossible by monotherapy. It was realized that the simultaneous normalization of blood pressure and that of abnormal lipid profile with 2-3 or more drugs have great importance for preventing atherosclerotic complications.We started an open-formed study with about 1000 hypertensive patients complicated with dyslipidemia, visceral obesity, metabolic syndrome and diabetes type 2. The base of our therapeutic strategy was a typical poly-pharmacologic treatment with ACE inhibitor (lisinopril), calcium antagonist (amlodipine), statin (atorvastatin) and antiplatelet therapy (if it was necessary).", 
    "26": "One of the greatest challenges of cardiovascular prevention is to minimize the risk of cardiovascular events through the achievement of target lipid levels. Its importance is suggested by the comprehensive meta-analyses of large scale clinical trials and the therapeutic guidelines determining everyday clinical practice. The attainment of target levels is often emphasized, nevertheless, there is a gap between theory and practice. The authors compare the goal attainment rate based on Hungarian medical literature and their own data, and analyze the possibilities of further improvement. The CEL Program evaluated the achievement rate of target total cholesterol levels in more than 10 000 patients of general practitioners in 2004, 2005 and 2006, and the ratio increased from 12% to 30% within 3 years. According to the results of the Hungarian REALITY study the rate of patients achieving the target total cholesterol levels was 21% in 2004, and it increased to 27% during a 3-year period. To this very low improving rate also belongs the fact that in 2007, when only one fourth of patients were on target levels, 87% of general practitioners and 56% of specialists reconciled themselves to it and did not propose any modification in the therapy of patients not achieving the target levels. The surveys conducted at the department of internal medicine with cardiological profile of the county hospital in Gyula proved a considerable increase in the last 7 years in the administration of drugs improving the life expectancy of cardiovascular patients (aspirin, beta-blockers, ACE-inhibitors and statins) due to the widespread application of clinical guidelines and the special attention; nowadays the administration rate is above 90% in all four groups. Nevertheless, the rate of patients achieving the LDL-cholesterol goals was 37% in the high risk and 18% in the very high risk groups in December 2007 and January 2008. The fact that in the latter group only 21% of patients received combination therapy indicates that improving this ratio may be the next step. A greater emphasis should be placed on the achievement of target levels and regular revision of applied medical therapy, particularly in the high and very high risk patients as these groups can benefit the most from it.",

Statistically significant variables associated with more rapid kidney disease progression differ from those that predict death. Younger age, male sex, higher eGFR, higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure, lower hemoglobin level, higher phosphorus and parathyroid hormone levels, and greater proteinuria are associated with more rapid kidney disease progression, and use of angiotensin-converting enzymes/angiotensin receptor blockers are protective. Older age, lower diastolic blood pressure, lower hemoglobin level, and higher phosphorous and parathyroid hormone levels are associated with death, whereas vitamin D use is protective.",

Three types of yogurts were prepared from skim milk containing 0% (YI0, control), 2% (YI2), and 3% (YI3) Raftiline HP, respectively. The incorporation of Raftiline HP improved the growth of starter organisms, particularly that of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, resulting in shorter fermentation time. There was a significant improvement in total proteolysis, which was highest in yogurt containing 3% Raftiline HP. The ACE inhibitory activity was maximal in YI3 compared to YI2 and YI0. Incorporation of Raftiline HP did not affect whey separation and firmness of the low-fat yogurts.

The hydrolyzed bovine and porcine collagens and their permeates showed low ACE inhibitory activity (50% inhibitory concentration [IC(50)] = 5.42-15.58 mg of protein/mL). However, after in vitro gastrointestinal digestion, a significant increase in the ACE inhibitory potency of the hydrolyzed collagens was observed (IC(50) = 0.97-4.02 mg of protein/mL). Permeates had a higher ACE inhibitory activity and hypotensive activity than non-ultrafiltered hydrolysates. The P1 permeate of bovine and porcine collagen and the P3 fraction of the porcine collagen hydrolysate exhibited the best antihypertensive activity in vivo, promoting a maximum reduction in blood pressure of 22 mm Hg, 21.33 mm Hg, and 21.33 mm Hg, respectively, while lisinopril promoted a maximum reduction of 51.00 mm Hg. These results suggest that the commercial collagen hydrolysates of bovine and porcine origin may be a potential source of bioactive peptides.", 
    "50": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors proved to be effective in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Clinical effectiveness of this group of agents may largely depend on their pleiotropic effects. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of plasma- and tissue-type angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors on blood pressure and on systemic inflammation, hemostasis and oxidative functions in normotensive patients with stable coronary artery disease. Ninety patients with stable coronary artery disease enrolled into the study were randomly divided into three different groups, simultaneously treated with enalapril (20 mg/d, n = 30), perindopril (4 mg/d, n = 30) or placebo (n = 30). Plasma lipid profile and the levels of oxidized low density lipoproteins (LDLs), monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, interleukin-10, C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 were determined at the beginning of the study and after 30 and 90 days of treatment. Seventy-six patients completed the trial. Neither enalapril nor perindopril affected blood pressure or plasma lipids. Perindopril significantly reduced plasma levels of oxidized LDLs, CRP, MCP-1, fibrinogen and PAI-1, and increased interleukin-10. The effect of enalapril on these markers of systemic inflammation, hemostasis and oxidative functions was much less pronounced. The results showed that enalapril and perindopril were devoid of a blood pressure-lowering effect in normotensive patients with stable coronary artery disease. Perindopril was superior to enalapril in exhibiting antioxidant, antithrombotic and profibrinolytic activities. The treatment-induced changes in the balance between pro- and antiinflammatory cytokines and in hemostasis may contribute to the clinical effectiveness of tissue angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in the therapy of atherosclerosis-related disorders.", 
    "51": "In the present study, we investigated the effects of basal and intra-arterial infusion of bradykinin on unstressed forearm vascular volume (a measure of venous tone) and blood flow in healthy volunteers (n=20) and in chronic heart failure patients treated with ACEIs [ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors] (n=16) and ARBs (angiotensin receptor blockers) (n=14). We used radionuclide plethysmography to examine the effects of bradykinin and of the bradykinin antagonists B9340 [B1 (type 1)/B2 (type 2) receptor antagonist] and HOE140 (B2 antagonist). Bradykinin infusion increased unstressed forearm vascular volume in a similar dose-dependent manner in healthy volunteers and ARB-treated CHF patients (healthy volunteers maximum 12.3+/-2.1%, P<0.001 compared with baseline; ARB-treated CHF patients maximum 9.3+/-3.3%, P<0.05 compared with baseline; P=not significant for difference between groups), but the increase in unstressed volume in ACEI-treated CHF patients was higher (maximum 28.8+/-7.8%, P<0.001 compared with baseline; P<0.05 for the difference between groups). In contrast, while the increase in blood flow in healthy volunteers (maximum 362+/-9%, P<0.001) and in ACEI-treated CHF patients (maximum 376+/-12%, P<0.001) was similar (P=not significant for the difference between groups), the increase in ARB-treated CHF patients was less (maximum 335+/-7%, P<0.001; P<0.05 for the difference between groups). Infusion of each receptor antagonist alone similarly reduced basal unstressed volume and blood flow in ACEI-treated CHF patients, but not in healthy volunteers or ARB-treated CHF patients. In conclusion, bradykinin does not contribute to basal venous tone in health, but in ACEI-treated chronic heart failure it does. In ARB-treated heart failure, venous responses to bradykinin are preserved but arterial responses are reduced compared with healthy controls. Bradykinin-mediated vascular responses in both health and heart failure are mediated by the B2, rather than the B1, receptor.",

    "62": "At least 71 patients have been reported in which their otherwise typical subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE) skin lesions were felt to have been temporally associated with the systemic administration of a drug. The mean age of this cohort of drug-induced SCLE (DI-SCLE) patients was 59 years of age which is somewhat older than the mean age of previously reported idiopathic SCLE patient cohorts. Patients had been taking the suspected triggering drug for weeks to years before the onset of SCLE skin lesions. In addition, it was not unusual for 2-3 months to be required for resolution of the SCLE skin lesions following discontinuation of the triggering drug. A relatively large number of drugs representing different pharmacological classes have been implicated in the induction of SCLE. The drug classes that were more frequently encountered were those used for the treatment of cardiovascular disease, especially hypertension. Calcium channel blockers were especially common in this regard. Elderly individuals being treated for hypertension are often taking multiple classes of drugs that have been implicated in triggering SCLE (thiazide diuretics, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta-blockers). An approach to the management of DI-SCLE is presented. Ro/SS-A autoantibodies tended to remain present in the blood after resolution of drug-induced SCLE skin lesions. A common link between the disparate group of drug structures implicated in triggering SCLE is their tendencies to produce photosensitivity and lichenoid drug reactions. This leads to the speculation that DI-SCLE could represent a photo-induced isomorphic/K\u00f6ebner response in an immunogenetically predisposed host.", 
    "63": "Drug-induced lupus erythematosus (DILE) is defined as a lupus-like syndrome temporally related to continuous drug exposure which resolves after discontinuation of the offending drug. There are currently no standard diagnostic criteria for DILE and the pathomechanisms are still unclear. Similarly to idiopathic lupus, DILE can be diveded into systemic (SLE), subacute cutaneous (SCLE) and chronic cutaneous lupus (CCLE). Systemic DILE is characterized by typical lupus-like symptoms including skin signs, usually mild systemic involvement and a typical laboratory profile with positive antinuclear and anti-histone antibodies, while anti-double strand (ds) DNA and anti-extractable nuclear antigens antibodies are rare. High risk drugs include hydralazine, procainamide and isoniazid. Drug-induced SCLE is very similar to idiopathic SCLE in terms of clinical and serologic characteristic, and it is more common than the systemic form of DILE. Drugs associated with SCLE include calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, interferons, thiazide diuretics and terbinafine. Drug-induced CCLE is very rarely reported in the literature and usually refers to fluorouracile agents or non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Recently, cases of DILE have been reported with anti-TNFalpha agents. These cases present with disparate clinical features including arthritis/arthralgia, skin rash, serositis, cytopenia and variable laboratory abnormalities. DILE to anti-TNFalpha agents differs in several ways to classic DILE. The incidence of rashes is higher compared to classical systemic DILE. In most cases of classic DILE visceral involvement is rare, whereas several cases of anti-TNFalpha DILE with evidence of renal disease have been reported. Low serum complement levels as well as anti-extractable nuclear antigen antibodies and anti-dsDNA antibodies are rarely present in classic DILE, whereas they are reported in half the cases of anti-TNFalpha DILE; in contrast, anti-histone antibodies are described in classic DILE more often than in anti-TNFalpha DILE. Recognition of DILE in patients receiving anti-TNFalpha therapy can be difficult due to the symptoms of their underlying disease. A temporal association (months to years) of the offending drug with characteristic or suggestive symptoms, and resolution of symptoms on drug withdrawal is the best evidence for this diagnosis of DILE.",

    "65": "To address the multiplicity of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) with particular interest in its local, synergistic regulation, we investigate dynamic changes of the RAS and associated systems in response to external stimuli in the rat. We tested influences of the RAS blockade (candesartan and enalapril), diuretics (hydrochlorothiazide), high lipid diet, and salt loading on tissue mRNA level of 12 principal genes. Under the hemodynamic conditions appropriately predetermined, we quantitatively evaluated mRNA level changes with and without each intervention in five organs-the brain, heart, kidney, liver, and adipose tissues-of male rats (n = 5 each). A total of 250 tissues were examined by real-time PCR. Significant changes in mRNA level (P < 0.05) were found in a drug-, diet- and tissue-specific manner. For instance, 29% of genes (14 out of 48 tissues showing detectable mRNA levels) were differentially regulated by candesartan and enalapril, although both drugs reduced blood pressure to similar extents. When the overall interactions among 12 genes were compared between interventions, the RAS and associated systems appeared to change in the opposite direction between candesartan and high lipid diet in the adipose tissue and between candesartan and salt loading in the heart. Enalapril, however, induced unique patterns of perturbation in the local RAS under the corresponding conditions. Thus, this study provides a fundamental picture of gene expression profile in vivo in the RAS and associated systems. In particular, our data highlight differential regulation between candesartan and enalapril, which may reflect the individual pharmacological properties regarding clinical implications.", 
    "66": "Renal artery stenosis (RAS) caused by atherosclerotic changes of the renal arteries has become a concern as a cause of end-stage renal failure. Percutaneous balloon angioplasty with or without endovascular stenting is an increasingly accepted procedure at the expense of classical approaches such as aortorenal bypass and other types of surgery. Renal percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting (RPTAS) represent the first therapeutic choice; however, there is doubt regarding the satisfactory long-term outcome for primary RPTAS. Currently, there is no clear evidence whether or not RPTAS prevents further progressive renal function decline because comparisons between interventional randomized studies and medical therapy are still lacking. Despite the fact that the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) may be a potential cause of acute renal failure, clinical data suggest that ACEI therapy is associated with better survival in patient with RAS. In our case, the use of ACEIs has been fundamental for the indirect evaluation of restenosis degree and RPTAS.",

Current evidence suggests that early noninvasive continuous positive airway pressure and early aggressive preload reduction with intravenous nitroglycerin are first-line interventions. Afterload reduction with sublingual captopril, with or without nitroglycerin, improves outcomes and is a second-line intervention. Furosemide is associated with adverse outcomes when used alone and should be given only after vasodilator therapy as a third-line intervention. Inotropes should be used only with demonstrably poor perfusion as they do not improve outcomes and may indeed be associated with increased mortality. Concurrent vasodilator therapy should be considered as soon as possible. Morphine should not be used as it is associated with adverse outcomes.

Similarly as for the myocardium, these effects are reproducible for other solid organs. Here we report a case of a renal transplant recipient with decompensated proximal transplant artery stenosis due to ACE inhibition resulting in acute renal failure. The transplant perfusion was strictly dependent on systemic arterial blood pressure leading to intermittent episodes of renal ischemia and reperfusion. Renal function was severely decreased (glomerular filtration rate approximately 8 ml/min) with the need of hemodialysis treatment over a period of 4 weeks after transplantation. After dilatation of the stenosis, the patient's renal function improved rapidly and achieved values better than ever before.

    "96": "New components and functions of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) are still being unravelled. The classical RAS as it looked in the middle 1970s consisted of circulating renin, acting on angiotensinogen to produce angiotensin I, which in turn was converted into angiotensin II (Ang II) by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Ang II, still considered the main effector of RAS was believed to act only as a circulating hormone via angiotensin receptors, AT1 and AT2. Since then, an expanded view of RAS has gradually emerged. Local tissue RAS systems have been identified in most organs. Recently, evidence for an intracellular RAS has been reported. The new expanded view of RAS therefore covers both endocrine, paracrine and intracrine functions. Other peptides of RAS have been shown to have biological actions; angiotensin 2-8 heptapeptide (Ang III) has actions similar to those of Ang II. Further, the angiotensin 3-8 hexapeptide (Ang IV) exerts its actions via insulin-regulated amino peptidase receptors. Finally, angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7) acts via mas receptors. The discovery of another ACE2 was an important complement to this picture. The recent discovery of renin receptors has made our view of RAS unexpectedly complex and multilayered. The importance of RAS in cardiovascular disease has been demonstrated by the clinical benefits of ACE inhibitors and AT1 receptor blockers. Great expectations are now generated by the introduction of renin inhibitors. Indeed, RAS regulates much more and diverse physiological functions than previously believed.", 
    "97": "Endothelial injury is thought to play a pivotal role in the development and progression of vascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis, hypertension or restenosis, as well as their complications, including myocardial infarction or stroke. Accumulating evidence suggests that bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) promote endothelial repair and contribute to ischemia-induced neovascularization. Coronary artery disease and its risk factors, such as diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension and smoking, are associated with a reduced number and impaired functional activity of circulating EPCs. Moreover, initial data suggest that reduced EPC levels are associated with endothelial dysfunction and an increased risk of cardiovascular events, compatible with the concept that impaired EPC-mediated vascular repair promotes progression of vascular disease. In this review we summarize recent data on the effects of pharmacological agents on mobilization and functional activity of EPCs. In particular, several experimental and clinical studies have suggested that statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers, PPAR-gamma agonists and erythropoietin increase the number and functional activity of EPCs. The underlying mechanisms remain largely to be defined; however, they likely include activation of the PI3-kinase/Akt pathway and endothelial nitric oxide synthase, as well as inhibition of NAD(P)H oxidase activity of progenitor cells.",

Respiratory polygraphy revealed Cheyne-Stokes respiration with a respiratory disturbance index of > or =5/h sleep in 32 (64%) of the seven female and 43 male patients. The prevalence of Cheyne-Stokes respiration defined by using the threshold of an apnea index of > or =10/h was 30%.",

There was a close positive correlation between Hb and eGFR, and a negative correlation with albuminuria and proteinuria. These close associations were also confirmed with linear regression analysis. A significant negative correlation was observed between serum creatinine levels and Hb. There was no negative correlation between actual Hb and mean HbA(1c) in the individual follow-up periods. No correlation was found between blood glucose (morning and postprandial blood glucose) and Hb. Blood leukocyte numbers, as a parameter of systemic inflammation, were not correlated with Hb.

    "124": "Methods for assessment of chronic kidney disease (CKD) are advancing worldwide. To this end, the Subcommittee of Measures for Pediatric CKD in the Japanese Society for Pediatric Nephrology was started in 2006. This Subcommittee has embarked on a multidisciplinary study for determining the normal/usual baseline value of serum creatinine and cystatin C, and standardizing the method of inulin clearance in children. For adults, pharmacotherapies such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers have been shown to be effective in non-diabetic nephropathy. This same treatment for childhood CKD is generally adopted, but there is no corresponding evidence of similar efficacy. We believe a randomized controlled trial to that end should be undertaken.", 
    "125": "The purpose of treatment for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is to preserve the renal function and to prevent the cardiovascular disease (CVD). CKD patients frequently present non-dipper and salt-sensitive type hypertension, which is a powerful predictor for both the CKD and CVD. Many previous clinical studies in CKD patients showed that appropriate blood pressure control was absolutely necessary to prevent the progression of CKD and development of CVD. From these studies, the target blood pressure for CKD patients is determined as less than 130/80 mmHg, if amount of urinary protein < 1 g/day, and 125/75 mmHg, if urinary protein > 1 g/day. Especially, blood pressure control using the RAS (renin-angiotensin system) inhibitor such as ARBs or ACEIs is superior to other classes of antihypertensive agents in reducing the amount of urinary protein and in preserving renal function. Thus, ARBs and/or ACEIs should be administered to CKD patients unless hyperkalemia or excessive increase in serum creatinine level is observed. Furthermore, hypertension in CKD patients is sometimes intractable and other classes of antihypertensive agents should be administered in addition to ARBs or ACEIs to obtain the target blood pressure.", 
    "126": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is characterized by proteinuria and kidney dysfunction caused by multiple factors. Metabolic disorders such as diabetes, dyslipidemia and hypertension are involved in the underlying pathological mechanisms of CKD and cardiovascular disease (CVD). In patients with CKD, CVD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Recent clinical studies have revealed that intervention by angiotensin II blockade with ARB and ACEI reduces CKD and CVD. Accordingly, earlier intervention to metabolic disorders with blockers for angiotensin II and aldosterone may prevent CKD as well as CVD associated with CKD.", 
    "127": "The gain of the volume-sensitive cardiopulmonary reflex (VSCR) is impaired in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Sensitivity of VSCR control of efferent renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) in SHR is restored when cardiac hypertrophy and hypertension are reduced by enalapril treatment. The present study investigated which of these two parameters, cardiac hypertrophy or hypertension, has more influence on the impairment of VSCR control of RSNA in SHR. Rats (SHR or Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats) were treated with enalapril (10 mg/kg per day; SHRE and WKYE groups, respectively) or hydralazine (5 mg/kg per day; SHRH and WKYH groups, respectively) mixed in their food for 1 month. Control SHR and WKY rats were fed a normal diet. After the treatment regimen, the VSCR was evaluated by determining the decrease in RSNA elicited by acute isotonic saline volume expansion. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was assessed via an intrafemural catheter and cardiac hypertrophy was determined by the left ventricular (LV) weight/bodyweight (BW) ratio. Afferent baroceptor nerve activity (BNA) was also evaluated during volume expansion to verify participation of the baroreflex. Volume expansion produced an attenuated renal sympathoinhibitory response in SHR compared with WKY rats. Enalapril treatment restored the volume expansion-induced decrease in RSNA in SHRE (-41 +/- 8%) compared with WKY rats (-44 +/- 3%). Although both enalapril and hydralazine treatment reduced MAP in SHR (P < 0.01; 126 +/- 5, 133 +/- 6 and 160 +/- 6 mmHg in SHRE, SHRH and SHR, respectively), hydralazine did not restore the sensitivity of VSCR control of RSNA in SHRH. Spontaneously hypertensive rats with established hypertension had a higher LV/BW ratio compared with WKY rats (3.22 +/- 0.14 vs 1.98 +/- 0.06 mg/g, respectively; P < 0.01). Enalapril reduced the LV/BW ratio in SHRE (2.30 +/- 0.07 mg/g; P < 0.01). Although hydralazine reduced LV hypertrophy, there was a weaker reduction in SHRH (2.68 +/- 0.04 mg/g; P < 0.05) compared with SHRE. There was no statistically significant difference among the WKY rat, WKYE and WKYH groups (P > 0.05). There was no change in afferent BNA during volume expansion in normal or hypertensive animals. Taken together, these results indicate that the impairment of VSCR control of RSNA in the SHR model of hypertension correlates better with the magnitude of cardiac hypertrophy than the level of arterial pressure.",

The patient was treated with antivenom, local anesthetic, and fluid replacement. Most of the systemic manifestations disappeared within 1 h after antivenom. Laboratory blood analyses at T0, T1, T6, T24, and T48 detected circulating venom by ELISA only at T0, before antivenom infusion (47.5 ng/mL; cut-off, 17.1 ng/mL); his serum blood sugar was 163 mg/dL at T0.

    "149": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common rhythm disturbance in medical practice and represents a very expensive health problem. AF can be managed with the prevention of thromboembolism and either a rate control of rhythm strategy. As both strategies have important limitations, probably a preventative strategy in patients at risk of developing arrhythmia can be a more attractive option. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) seems to be involved in the genesis of arrhythmia by the following two mechanisms: 1. the induction of atrial fibrosis and structural remodelling by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) expression and reduction of collagenase activity; 2. the induction of electrical remodelling by shortening of the atrial effective refractory period (AERP) and of the action potential duration. For these reasons it has been hypothesized that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) and angiotensin-II receptor blockers (ARBs) may play a role in preventing AF recurrence. The aim of the present review was to analyse evidence supporting the usefulness of RAS inhibition in patients with AF in order to focus on which specific subset of patients it would most favour. After reviewing the literature, we conclude that, although many studies and meta-analysis have supported the advantage of RAS block in preventing AF recurrence, it is premature to recommend the use of ACE-Is and ARBs specifically for the prevention of AF. However we believe that as these drugs are safe and manageable, they should be considered the drugs of choice in patients with AF and coexisting clinical conditions such as hypertension, coronary disease, heart failure and diabetes mellitus.",

A subgroup of cases was exposed long term (mean total duration of use: 9.7-11.4 years, range: 7.5-23.1 years). Modest differences in risk between users of the four classes were detected for colon, head & neck, lung, and hematological cancers but none of these associations demonstrated a clear dose response relationship for both first cancer and fatal cancer. Otherwise, for cancer at all sites combined and for the four most common cancers, we were able to rule out, with reasonable confidence, small to modest differences in the risk of cancer among users of any duration (upper 95% confidence intervals (CIs): 1.45) and modest to large differences in risk among long-term users (upper 95%CI: 3.06).",

    "159": "The chromatographic behavior of enalapril was investigated under different stationary and mobile phase conditions in an effort to unravel interferences in the underlying retention mechanism, which would affect its relation to octanol-water partitioning. Extrapolated retention factors, logk(w), were used as relevant chromatographic indices. The retention/pH profile was established and the peak split phenomenon, associated with cis/trans interconversion, was also monitored as a function of pH. The pH at maximum retention and minimum peak split occurrence was chosen for further investigation, so that the presence of zwitterionic structure was guaranteed and any effect of cis/trans interconversion could be ignored. Retention of zwitterionic enalapril was found to be very sensitive to mobile phase conditions in regard to organic modifier as well to the aqueous component. The use of morpholine-propanesulfonic acid (MOPS) as buffer and the presence of n-octanol as mobile phase additive proved critical factors for maximum suppression of secondary interactions. Nevertheless, the corresponding extrapolated retention factor was considerably larger than octanol-water logD value at the isoelectric point. However, logk(w) could be successfully converted to logD by means of a calibration equation established for ionized acidic compounds.",

LcV due to IgG- or IgM-containing immune complexes has a better prognosis. If triggers cannot be detected or avoided, symptomatic treatments are usually sufficient due to a usually favourable course. When hemorrhagic blisters suggest incipient skin necrosis corticosteroids are indicated. For chronic or relapsing LcV we suggest colchicine or dapsone. In adults with PSH and severe glomerulonephritis there is insufficient evidence for the efficacy of glucocorticoids; but e.g. ACE inhibitors can be helpful depending on symptoms. In cryoglobulinemic vasculitis underlying diseases (often plasmocytoma or hepatitis C) should be treated, sometimes supplemented by plasmapheresis. Dapsone or colchicine are usually started for urticarial vasculitis. ANCA-associated systemic vasculitis requires rapid and aggressive induction therapy, usually with glucocorticoids and cyclophosphamide. In classic polyarteriitis nodosa glucocorticoids improve prognosis, in polyarteriitis nodosa cutanea colchicine or dapsone are more appropriate. Giant cell arteriitis requires rapid therapy with glucocorticoids. For livedo vasculopathy antithrombotic measures are required with low molecular heparin or antagonists to vitamin K, for maintenance dipyridamol und aspirin.",

BP is decreased approximately 5 mmHg when angiotensin II blockers are added to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and is less than typically seen when other agents are added to existing ACE inhibitor regimens. Dual RAAS blockade results in additional reduction in proteinuria. Clinically insignificant increases in hyperkalemia and modest decreases in GFR occur. Data regarding long-term preservation of renal function are lacking.

In pooled analyses, the achieved blood pressure is similar for older and less expensive drugs, such as thiazide-type diuretics, and for newer and more costly agents, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, -angiotensin-receptor blockers, and calcium-channel blockers. If blood pressure--independent differences favoring one antihypertensive drug class over another truly exist, they have been singularly difficult to uncover with any consistency. Considering that multidrug therapy is required in the majority of patients with hypertension, the debate as to which drug class is best to start with is moot, in that the clinician is now more called upon to decide the best combinations of drugs and not the best monotherapy.",

The loss of renal function leads to impaired renal autoregulation and renders the kidney vulnerable to the damaging effects of uncontrolled hypertension. Mounting evidence indicates that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers slow the progression of chronic kidney disease through effects beyond lowering blood pressure. Studies are needed to determine whether high doses of the single agent or combination therapy is most effective in providing renal protection. Urinary protein excretion is a useful tool for monitoring and titrating therapy to maximize renal protection. Changes in the serum creatinine concentration and hyperkalemia are complications of antihypertensive therapy in patients with chronic kidney disease that can be successfully managed to allow continued use of renin-angiotensin blockade.",

Furthermore, a recent study on acute myocardial infarction suggested that weekend admissions were associated with higher mortality compared with weekday admissions. We sought to determine if compliance with guideline recommendations for acute coronary syndrome performance measures would be worse on weekends/holidays compared with weekdays. We utilized the American Heart Association's Get with the Guidelines (GWTG)--Coronary Artery Disease database. This study included 154,910 patients admitted to 515 various hospitals from January 14, 2000 to April 30, 2007 with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Patients discharged on weekdays were older and were more likely to be women, have a history of atrial fibrillation, cerebral vascular accident/transient ischemic attack and chronic renal insufficiency, and present with unstable angina. Although patients discharged on the weekends/holidays were slightly less likely to receive angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors than those discharged on weekdays (68.3% vs 69.5%, p <0.0001), all other measures were similar, and a composite performance measure for 100% compliance was equal in both groups (81.5% vs 81.4%, p = 0.77). In conclusion, within GWTG participating hospitals, weekend/holiday staffing provides the same quality of care in ACS for discharge medications and counseling compared with full weekday staffing.

The antioxidant and antihypertensive properties of Pestalotiopsis isolates were determined by measuring 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl inhibitory activity, lipid peroxidation, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition activity. Pestalotiopsis isolates of T. arjuna origin exhibited maximum radical scavenging activity compared with the others. The IC50 values of Pestalotiopsis extracts for 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl scavenging activity ranged from 14 to 27 microg/mL compared with 15 and 6 microg/mL for butylated hydroxytoluene and ascorbic acid, respectively. The DNA damage study was also done for three isolates, TC-315, TA-37, and TA-60; TA-37 gave 80% protection. The IC50 values of Pestalotiopsis extracts for lipid peroxidation ranged between 30 and 35.5 microg/mL, while for the positive control butylated hydroxytoluene, it was 26 microg/mL. Out of 32 fungal extracts screened for antihypertensive assay, five (TA-37, TA-60, TA-102, TA-103, and TC-320) showed >60% inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme. The IC50 values for five extracts ranged from 21 to 37 microg/mL and was 20 microg/mL for captopril used as a positive control. The antibacterial activity was measured by the microplate-based turbidity measurement method.

Over the past 2 decades the adherence to practice guidelines for treating HF, including the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin-receptor antagonists and beta-blockers, has resulted in improved survival for patients. However, despite the use of these evidence-based strategies that block the deleterious effects of neurohormonal activation, the overall mortality for HF remains unacceptably high. Unfortunately, when patients remain symptomatic despite having their medical and/or device therapies optimized, the \"next steps\" to improving patient morbidity are not at all clear. Thus, there remains an unmet need with respect to the treatment of HF patients. The concept that cardiac remodeling represents an important mechanism for disease progression in HF is reviewed, as well as discussion of several novel treatment strategies with respect to devices that are intended to prevent worsening cardiac remodeling.",

There is evidence that administration of an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor antagonist (ARB) may induce a decrease of sympathetic hyperactivity as well as a reduced rate of adverse cardiovascular events in patients in renal failure.--In patients with renal disease and high proteinuria antihypertensive therapy with ACE-inhibitors or ARB delays the progression of chronic renal failure. Combined therapy of ACE-inhibitors plus ARB may reduce proteinuria more than that would be the case with either of these drugs alone. However, there is no evidence that combination of these two drugs improves renal function more than monotherapy.--Renal artery stenosis of > 70% should be treated by dilatation, if there is evidence of fibromuscular dysplasia. Dilatation and/or stent implantation in an atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis of > 70% should be performed if indicated by the patient's clinical state. i.e. severe hypertension has proved to be resistant to triple drug antihypertensive therapy or pulmonary edema has occurred frequently.

We showed that treatment of hypertensive rats with the AT(1) receptor antagonist olmesartan increased ACE2 mRNA and protein in the thoracic aorta, suggesting that endogenous ANG II tonically reduces the enzyme. We now report that ANG II downregulates ACE2 activity and mRNA in rat aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) to reduce the conversion of ANG II to ANG-(1-7). Although ANG-(1-7) alone had no effect on the regulation of ACE2 mRNA, the heptapeptide prevented the ANG II-mediated reduction in ACE2 mRNA, an effect blocked by the selective ANG-(1-7) receptor antagonist [d-Ala(7)]-ANG-(1-7). The reduction in ACE2 mRNA by ANG II was also prevented by the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase inhibitor PD98059. Treatment of VSMCs with ANG II increased ERK1/ERK2 activity, which was significantly reduced by pretreatment with ANG-(1-7). Blockade of the ANG II-mediated reduction in ACE2 mRNA and increase in MAP kinase activity by ANG-(1-7) was prevented by pretreatment with sodium vanadate, a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, or okadaic acid, a serine-threonine phosphatase inhibitor, suggesting that the heptapeptide activates a MAP kinase phosphatase. This study is the first to show that the MAP kinase-phosphatase pathway is a primary molecular mechanism for regulating ACE2 to maintain the balance between ANG II and ANG-(1-7). The modulatory role of ANG-(1-7) in the regulation of ACE2 by ANG II suggests a complex interplay between the two peptides that is mediated by specific receptors to activate distinct signaling pathways.",

The aim of this study was to assess the involvement of AngII in LH-induced meiotic resumption and of prostaglandins (PGs) in the action of AngII. In the experiment I, seven cows were superovulated, intrafollicularly injected with 10 muM saralasin (a competitive AngII antagonist) or saline when the follicles reached a diameter larger than 12 mm, and challenged with a GnRH agonist to induce an LH surge. Fifteen hours after GnRH, the animals were ovariectomized and the oocytes were recovered to determine the stage of meiosis. The oocytes from follicles that received saline were in germinal vesicle (GV) breakdown (30.8%) or metaphase I (MI; 69.2%) stage while those that received saralasin were in the GV stage (100%; P<0.001) 15 h after GnRH agonist. In another experiment, oocytes were co-cultured with follicular hemisections for 15 h to determine whether PGs mediate the effect of AngII on meiotic resumption. Indomethacin (10 microM) inhibited AngII-induced meiotic resumption (13.4 vs 77.5% MI without indomethacin; P<0.001). Furthermore, the GV oocytes progressed to MI at a similar rate when PGE(2), PGF(2alpha) or AngII was present in the co-culture system with follicular cells (PGE(2) 77.4%, PGF(2alpha) 70.0%, and AngII 75.0% MI). In conclusion, our results provide strong evidence that AngII mediates the resumption of meiosis induced by an LH surge in bovine oocytes and that this event is dependent on PGE(2) or PGF(2alpha) produced by follicular cells.",

Opinions vary considerably concerning the future of aliskiren and renin inhibition. Some experts argue that renin inhibitors should only be prescribed when less expensive blockers of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), with established effects on morbidity and mortality, are not tolerated or have failed to reduce blood pressure effectively. Others propose that because renin is a highly specific catalyst for the rate-limiting step of the RAS, renin inhibitors have the potential to supersede angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers as the preferred inhibitors of the cascade in patients with particular pathologies and/or genotypes. It has also been suggested that dual blockade of the RAS might be particularly advantageous. This review discusses the currently available evidence, and concludes with speculation concerning the future of direct renin inhibition.",

Primary prevention is a new strategy in treating AF; previously, it was more common to focus on preventing adverse outcomes and controlling the arrhythmia's rate and rhythm. In this review, we consider the possible preventive effects of antihypertensive treatment on new-onset AF seen in recent trials, especially with blockers of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Several secondary analyses of large, randomized trials regarding hypertension and heart failure have shown promising results with benefits beyond the expected blood pressure-lowering effect. A few prospective studies on prevention of AF recurrence with RAS blockade have been published, and more studies are expected to be published in the near future.",

This condition, termed sarcopenia, is associated with several adverse outcomes, including loss of autonomy and mortality. Due to the high prevalence of sarcopenia, a deeper understanding of its pathophysiology and possible remedies represents a high public health priority. Evidence suggests the existence of a relationship between declining growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels and age-related changes in body composition and physical function. Therefore, the age-dependent decline of GH and IGF-1 serum levels may promote frailty by contributing to the loss of muscle mass and strength. Preclinical studies showed that infusion of angiotensin II produced a marked reduction in body weight, accompanied by decreased serum and muscle levels of IGF-1. Conversely, overexpression of muscle-specific isoform of IGF-1 mitigates angiotensin II-induced muscle loss. Moreover, IGF-1 serum levels have been shown to increase following angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) treatment. Here we will review the most recent evidence regarding age-related changes of the GH/IGF-1 axis and its modulation by several interventions, including ACEIs which might represent a potential novel strategy to delay the onset and impede the progression of sarcopenia.",

In advanced Chagas disease heart failure, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and diuretics may be given at first to compensate for congestive symptoms. After clinical status improvement, beta-blockers should be given at targeted doses, if necessary reducing angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor doses. Primary and secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death may be accomplished with implantable cardioverter defibrillators because of the high recurrence of life-threatening arrhythmias despite amiodarone administration.

It has been found that in conjunctival ischemia, there is a considerable increase in the activity of ACE, the key enzyme of the renin-angiotensin system, the activity of which largely determines the microcirculation in eye tissues. Instillations of the ACE inhibitor to rabbits within 2 weeks after alkaline burn of the eye result in a reduction in ACE activity and an earlier recovery of microcirculation in the area of conjunctival ischemia. Instillations of the ACE inhibitor captopril in ocular burn facilitate the maintenance of the tear antioxidant potential at the high level, which also suggests that the ACE inhibitor has a positive effect on the course of reparative processes after ocular burn injury. The findings suggest that it is promising to locally use ACE inhibitors for the treatment of ischemic processes in the eye.",

All examination were been performed before administration of drugs and 6 months after the therapy. The dynamics of indices of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, echocardiography, cycle ergometry, anthropometry, lipid, carbohydrate exchange and tolerability of conducted therapy was been evaluated. The use of this combination of the drugs may be recommended to be included in the treatment of arterial hypertension within the bounds of metabolic syndrome, as in most of cases they promote an achievement of target blood pressure level, have a cardioprotective action, high tolerability and favorable metabolic profile. The combination of enalapril and long-acting nifedipin has a more evident antihypertensive activity but a therapy with enalapril and moxonidine has a positive effect on the indices of carbohydrate exchange.",

    "237": "D-Glucaric acid is a non-toxic natural compound found in many fruits and vegetables. Our previous studies have shown that the \u03b2-glucuronidase inhibitor D-glucaro-1,4-lactone, an active metabolite of D-glucaric acid, inhibits chemically-induced tumorigenesis in rodents. D-Glucaro-1,4-lactone has a synthetic precursor, 2,5-di-O-acetyl-D-glucaro-1,4:6,3-dilactone or aceglatone (ACE), known as a postoperative prophylactic agent, and a natural precursor, D-glucurono-\u03b3-lactone (GL). In the present study, we first examined the effect of ACE on the initiation phase of rat colon carcinogenesis induced by 15 mg/kg azoxymethane (AOM) administered 3 times by subcutaneous (s.c.) injection at weeks 1, 2, and 3 of a 5-week short-term experiment. ACE (0.5 or 2%) was administered as a dietary supplement for 5 weeks. At 5 weeks after the initiation of treatment, the formation of aberrant crypt foci (ACF) in the rat groups treated with AOM plus a 0.5 or 2% ACE diet was significantly reduced by 48.6 and 55.3%, respectively, compared to the group administered AOM alone. In a previous study, 0.5 and 2% ACE diets dispensed during AOM treatment had a tendency to decrease AOM-induced colonic tumor incidence. In the present long-term 36-week colon tumorigenesis experiment, GL (0.5 or 2%) administered via the diet during the initiation phase (starting 1 week before the first dose of AOM and ending 1 week after the 3rd dose) did not have any significant effects on tumor incidence. On the other hand, continued post-initiation treatment with ACE (0.5 and 2%) markedly reduced colonic tumor incidence by 70 and 80%, respectively. GL was effective to a similar extent (70% inhibition), but only at a concentration of 2%. We conclude that ACE inhibits the initiation and post-initiation stages of AOM-induced colon carcinogenesis, while GL affects only the post-initiation stages.", 
    "238": "The comparative anti-hypertensive drug trials conducted to assess their cardiovascular protective efficacy actually produce compatible, not conflicting, results. In the last decade, there were 13 major comparative hypertension drug trials with the cardiovascular primary outcome being statistically equivalent in 11 of these 13 trials, involving over 90 percent of the randomised 168,593 patients. Where secondary outcomes favour a drug in these trials, that arm has a significantly lower treated blood pressure as in LIFE, VALUE, ASCOT and ALLHAT. Controversy occurs in seeking to attribute the benefit to drug effect; if the benefit is attributed to the lower achieved blood pressure, then the trials become consistent. The safety and value of diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers in reducing blood pressure, and in reducing clinical cardiovascular outcomes, is now clearly established. Overall, the importance of tight blood pressure control in reducing cardiovascular outcomes must be emphasised. Physicians should concentrate on achieving good blood pressure control, which often requires a combination of several antihypertensive drugs.", 
    "239": "Several classes of antihypertensive drugs have been shown to improve vascular function through mechanisms other than reducing blood pressure (BP) alone. Certain dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) increase nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability and decrease oxidative stress, thereby improving endothelial activity and vascular function. Pulse wave analyses have shown that these agents reduce the impact of pressure wave reflections on central systolic BP (SBP), consistent with a decrease in arterial stiffness. The complementary vascular mechanisms of these drug classes suggest that combination therapy may be effective for improving clinical outcomes. In animal model studies, combination calcium channel/RAS blockade has been shown to be more effective in improving endothelial dysfunction than treatment with drugs from either class alone. Furthermore, results from recent clinical trials suggest a greater reduction in central aortic SBP, pulse pressure, and cardiovascular events with calcium channel/RAS blockade vs. beta-blocker/diuretic therapy. These studies support the potential benefit of combination calcium channel and RAS blockade in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease.",

Although EDVI was reduced in the ACEI group, ESVI and EF improved only slightly, whereas in the group given beta-blockers, ESVI was reduced, EF improved, and EDVI was minimally reduced.

As compared to the primary variety, secondary cough headache began earlier (average 40 vs. 60 years old), was located posteriorly, lasted longer (5 years vs. 11 months), was associated with posterior fossa symptoms/signs and did not respond to indomethacin. All those patients showed difficulties in the cerebrospinal fluid circulation in the foramen magnum region in the dynamic MRI study and preoperative plateau waves, which disappeared after posterior fossa reconstruction. The mean age at onset for primary headaches provoked by physical exercise and sexual activity began at the same age (40 years old), shared clinical characteristics (bilateral, pulsating) and responded to beta-blockers. Contrary to cough headache, secondary cases are rare and the most frequent etiology was subarachnoid bleeding. In conclusion, these conditions account for a low proportion of headache consultations. These data show the total separation between cough headache versus headache due to physical exercise and sexual activity, confirm that these two latter headaches are clinical variants of the same entity and illustrate the clinical differences between the primary and secondary provoked headaches.", 
    "259": "Exercise-induced anaphylaxis (EIA) was defined for the first time in 1980. EIA is associated with different kind of exercise, although jogging is the most frequently reported. The clinical manifestations progress from itching, erythema and urticaria to some combination of cutaneous angioedema, gastrointestinal and laryngeal symptoms and signs of angioedema and vascular collapse. Mast cell participation in the pathogenesis of this syndrome has been proved by the finding of an elevated serum histamine level during experimentally-induced attacks and by cutaneous degranulation of mast cells with elevated serum tryptase after attacks. As predisposing factors of EIA, a specific or even aspecific sensitivity to food has been reported and such cases are called \"food-dependent EIA\". Many foods are implicated but particularly wheat, vegetables, crustacean. Another precipitating factor includes drugs intake (non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), climate variations and menstrual cycle factors. Treatment of an attack should include all the manoeuvres efficacious in the management of conventional anaphylactic syndrome, including the administration of epinephrine and antihistamines. Prevention of the attacks may be achieved with the interruption of the exercise at the appearance of the first premonitory symptoms. To prevent the onset of EIA it is also suitable to delay the exercise practice after at least 4-6 hours from the swallowing of food.", 
    "260": "Treatment of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) has changed considerably in the last few years, as reflected in various proposals for guidelines by the ACC/AHA/ESC based on clinical evidence. We analyzed the clinical implementation of these recommendations in our patient population between 2002 and 2005.",

    "262": "There were no differences in terms of age, gender ratio, risk factors for coronary artery disease, or previous myocardial revascularization. There was a decrease in the number of patients with previous myocardial infarction and renal insufficiency on admission, and an increase in patients with ST-segment elevation on admission. Treatment with clopidogrel (6% vs. 87%), beta-blockers (54% vs. 79%), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (72% vs. 84%) and statins (78% vs. 91%) increased (all with p < 0.001). On the other hand, there was a slight decrease in the use of aspirin (98% vs. 95%, p = 0.039) (with greater use of clopidogrel) and ticlopidine was no longer used (46% vs. 0%, p < 0.001). Use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists did not change significantly (66% vs. 67%, p = NS). Percutaneous coronary interventions increased (53% vs. 67% p < 0.001). There was no difference in in-hospital mortality (8.2% vs. 6.4%) or 30-day mortality (9.0% vs. 8.6%), but mortality was lower at one-year follow-up (17.1% vs. 11.7%, p = 0.039). Statins and beta-blockers are independent predictors of mortality during follow-up, with a protective effect.",

    "264": "The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril (CAS 107133-36-8) helps to prevent stroke recurrence by improving cerebral vasomotor reactivity (CVR). Perindopril-induced vasoreactivity changes in different brain structures of patients with chronic cerebrovascular disease were compared.", 
    "265": "The study population consisted of 6 hypertensive patients (mean age 65.5 +/- 9.9) who had experienced a cerebrovascular event; three each had minor ischemic episodes and hemorrhage. The administration of 4 mg/day perindopril was started one month after stroke onset; the follow-up lasted more than one year. Their cerebral blood flow (CBF), assessed at the start of perindopril administration and again 3 months later, was examined both at rest and after the administration of 15 mg/kg acetazolamide and the CVR was calculated. Regions of interest were cortical and subcortical areas on the CT scans.", 
    "266": "In the course of this study, none of the patients suffered stroke recurrence. The 3-month administration of perindopril lowered their systemic blood pressure without decreasing CBF and significantly increased cerebral vasoreactivity in the lesioned (p = 0.04355) and contralateral (p = 0.04090) cortical areas without producing significant changes in CVR in the subcortical gray matter (striatum and thalamus).", 
    "267": "The CVR in cortical structures recovered sooner than that in subcortical gray matter. Although the number of stroke patients included in this study was small, it is concluded that this phenomenon may be attributable to the earlier vasoreactivity increase in the cortical vessels than the subcortical perforators.",

Clinical efficacy of fosinopril, moexipril, perindopril, and ramipril was comparable: in compared groups statistically significant lowering of arterial pressure was achieved by day 6 of treatment and this lowering persisted up to day 36 of therapy with ramipril. All studied drugs were well tolerated. Ramipril was notable for highest economical efficacy determined by the method of \\\"minimization of expenditures\\\". Technology of assessment of clinico-economical effectiveness of preparations from the same pharmacological group can be used in compilation of standards of drug therapy of various diseases, basing on which a physician administers a concrete drug to a concrete patient.", 
    "269": "Endothelial cells detect physical and chemical changes in the blood vessels, and release various factors to counter these changes to maintain homeostasis. Traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors, such as hypertension, dyslipidemia and diabetes, cause endothelial dysfunction characterized by off-balanced vasodilation/vasoconstriction, increased oxidative stress and inflammation, deregulation of thrombosis and fibrinolysis, abnormal smooth muscle cell proliferation, and a deficient repair mechanism. Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have a much higher risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality than the general population. Endothelial dysfunction is commonly observed in CKD, likely preceding other cardiovascular complications. Lipid-lowering agents, such as statins, improve endothelial functions and are effective in reducing cardiovascular disease risk in the general population, but have not demonstrated comparable efficacy in the CKD patient population. Similarly, antidiabetic agents, such as thiazolidinediones, that improve endothelial function in the general population are less efficacious than expected in slowing disease progression and reducing cardiovascular disease risk in CKD patients. Interestingly, agents that activate the vitamin D receptor (VDR) for the treatment of hyperparathyroidism secondary to CKD are associated with a survival benefit in CKD patients that is likely mediated through the effects of the VDR on modulating key components involved in endothelial dysfunction. However, a randomized, clinical study is required to confirm the survival benefit of VDR activation therapy for CKD patients. Results from clinical studies suggest that managing hypertension alone may not be adequate in slowing CKD progression and its related cardiovascular complications. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers that target the renin-angiotensin system slow CKD progression, possibly due to their effects on improving endothelial function, independent of controlling blood pressure.", 
    "270": "The observation that angiotensin II is a potent angiogenic and growth factor raises the possibility that blocking its effects could reduce the incidence of cancer. We evaluated associations between use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and keratinocyte cancer incidence in a population at high risk of the disease.",

We followed participants from enrollment (November 1998 through January 2003) until first BCC or SCC. Study participants were examined every 6 months by a study dermatologist; biopsies were taken on all suspicious lesions and centrally reviewed. Use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs was ascertained from VA pharmacy records. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of BCC and SCC with use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs.", 
    "272": "During a median follow-up of 3.4 years, 472 incident BCCs, 309 SCCs, and 200 deaths from any cause were observed. Compared with nonusers, users of ACE inhibitors or ARBs had statistically significantly reduced risks of BCC (IRR(BCC) = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.50 to 0.76) and SCC (IRR(SCC) = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.52 to 0.87). The combined absolute incidence rates of BCC and SCC were 237 per 1000 person-years among users of ACE inhibitors or ARBs and 374 per 1000 person-years among nonusers. The greatest reduction in keratinocyte cancer was seen among people who initiated use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs during the study period (IRR(BCC) = 0.45 [95% CI = 0.34 to 0.59]; IRR(SCC) = 0.48 [95% CI = 0.35 to 0.67]).",

    "274": "We report that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), a critical physiologic regulator of blood pressure, angiogenesis, and inflammation, is a novel marker for identifying hemangioblasts differentiating from human embryonic stem cells (hESC). We demonstrate that ACE+CD45-CD34+/- hemangioblasts are common yolk sac (YS)-like progenitors for not only endothelium but also both primitive and definitive human lymphohematopoietic cells. Thrombopoietin and basic fibroblast growth factor are identified as critical factors for the proliferation of human hemangioblasts. The developmental sequence of human embryoid body hematopoiesis is remarkably congruent to the timeline of normal human YS development, which occurs during weeks 2 to 6 of human gestation. Furthermore, ACE and the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) directly regulate hemangioblast expansion and differentiation via signaling through the angiotensin II receptors AGTR1 and AGTR2. ACE enzymatic activity is required for hemangioblast expansion, and differentiation toward either endothelium or multipotent hematopoietic progenitors is dramatically augmented after manipulation of angiotensin II signaling with either AGTR1- or AGTR2-specific inhibitors. The RAS can therefore be exploited to direct the hematopoietic or endothelial fate of hESC-derived hemangioblasts, thus providing novel opportunities for human tissue engineering. Moreover, the initial events of human hematoendotheliogenesis can be delineated in a manner previously impossible because of inaccessibility to early human embryonic tissues.", 
    "275": "The 'Hypertension in the very elderly trial' (HYVET) was designed to answer the question whether antihypertensive treatment reduces strokes (both fatal and non-fatal strokes) without increasing total mortality. A total of 3845 patients were assigned to active treatment or placebo. About 90% had a history of hypertension, 65% of which were being treated. At the start of the study all antihypertensive treatment was stopped and the subjects were randomized to either indapamide 1.5 mg with or without perindopril 2-4 mg or to identical looking placebo. After about 2 years the trial was discontinued for ethical reasons as there was less death from any cause in the intervention group. Blood pressure decreased with 30/13 mmHg in the treatment versus 15/7 mmHg in the placebo group. There was a 30% decrease of all strokes (p = 0.06) but a significant reduction in fatal strokes (p < 0.05). Unexpected was the 21% reduction in all-cause mortality (p < 0.02). The 23% reduction in the rate of cardiovascular death was not significant (p < 0.06). Heart failure and total cardiovascular events decreased (p < 0.001). There were fewer adverse effects in the treatment group (p = 0.001). In our opinion HYVET proves that antihypertensive medication should not be stopped when patients pass the age of 80 years. However, it remains to be established whether treatment should be started in new patients who present themselves with hypertension above the age of 80 years.", 
    "276": "Within the primary structure of many pea and mung bean proteins are peptide sequences that can potentially be used in the formulation of therapeutic products for the treatment and prevention of human diseases. However, these peptide sequences need protease treatments before they can be released free of the parent proteins. Unlike chemical hydrolysis, enzymatic treatment enables more efficient tailoring of peptide products without formation of toxic by-products or destruction of amino acids. This review provides information on current methods that have been used to convert inactive pea and mung bean proteins into bioactive peptides. It focuses on 3 main bioactive properties, such as inhibitions of (1) angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity; (2) calmodulin (CaM)-dependent enzymes; and (3) copper-chelating activity. ACE is an established marker for hypertension, high levels of some CaM-dependent enzymes are risk factors for various human diseases including cancer and Alzheimer's disease, and high vascular copper concentrations may potentiate atherosclerosis. Also reviewed are the production and evaluation of activity of hypoallergenic peptides that may offer protection against anaphylactic reactions. The 3 main proteins discussed are chickpea, mung bean, and field pea.",

BPs were obtained using an aneroid sphygmomanometer. Glomerular filtration rate was measured by iohexol disappearance. Elevated BP was defined as BP >or=90th percentile for age, gender, and height. Hypertension was defined as BP >or=95th percentile or as self-reported hypertension plus current treatment with antihypertensive medications. For systolic BP, 14% were hypertensive and 11% were prehypertensive (BP 90th to 95th percentile); 68% of subjects with elevated systolic BP were taking antihypertensive medications. For diastolic BP, 14% were hypertensive and 9% were prehypertensive; 53% of subjects with elevated diastolic BP were taking antihypertensive medications. Fifty-four percent of subjects had either systolic or diastolic BP >or=95th percentile or a history of hypertension plus current antihypertensive use. Characteristics associated with elevated BP included black race, shorter duration of chronic kidney disease, absence of antihypertensive medication use, and elevated serum potassium. Among subjects receiving antihypertensive treatment, uncontrolled BP was associated with male sex, shorter chronic kidney disease duration, and absence of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker use. Thirty-seven percent of children with chronic kidney disease had either elevated systolic or diastolic BP, and 39% of these were not receiving antihypertensives, indicating that hypertension in pediatric chronic kidney disease may be frequently under- or even untreated. Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers may improve BP control in these patients.",

After solid phase extraction (SPE), the analytes and IS were chromatographed on a hypurity C8 (100 mm x 2.1 mm i.d., 5 microm particle size) column using 2 microL injection volume with a run time of 2.8 min. An isocratic mobile phase consisting of 0.5% (v/v) formic acid:acetonitrile (25:75, v/v) was used to separate all these drugs. The precursor and product ions of these drugs were monitored on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer, operating in the multiple reaction monitoring mode (MRM) without polarity switch. The proposed method was validated over the range of 5-500 ng/mL for hydrochlorothiazide method and 5-1500 ng/mL for quinapril and quinaprilat. Inter-batch and intra-batch precision (coefficient of variation - % CV) across five validation runs lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ), lower quality control (LQC), middle quality control (MQC), higher quality control (HQC) and upper limit of quantitation (ULOQ) was less than 15.

    "284": "Diabetes mellitus is a growing epidemic with a prevalence among patients with heart failure (HF) approaching 30%. Diabetes worsens the prognosis of HF, and the pathophysiology is complex and multifactorial. Early detection of subtle alterations in cardiac function by modern tools, such as Doppler echocardiography or brain natriuretic peptide dosage, is thus important in these patients. All drugs known to be effective in HF with systolic dysfunction are also effective in patients with diabetes. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists also seem particularly useful. Overall, however, little is known about the treatment of diabetic patients with HF, especially in case of preserved systolic function. Ongoing and future trials should help to determine the best treatment for these patients with or without associated diabetes. This review assesses the relationships between diabetes mellitus and HF and discusses the various medical strategies.",

We investigated the influence of baseline BP and changes in BP during a 1-year period on the survival of patients with HF, distinguishing among sudden cardiac death, nonsudden cardiac death, and noncardiac death. We also identified the possible relationship with the baseline values of and changes in other clinical and treatment variables, including pharmacologic treatments.",

A multivariable Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for clinical and therapeutic variables showed an independent association between low baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP) and nonsudden cardiac death (hazard ratio [HR] 0.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.93-0.98), but changes in SBP during the following year did not influence survival, regardless of the baseline SBP level (P = .55). Contrariwise, baseline diastolic BP was not associated with mortality, but an increase in diastolic BP during the following year showed a borderline independent significant association with lower nonsudden cardiac death (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.82-1.00). Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or beta-blockers at baseline was also associated with lower nonsudden cardiac mortality, as was an increase in left ventricular ejection fraction during the following year (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.51-0.93; P = .015).", 
    "287": "Among patients with stable HF, low SBP is associated with a greater risk of nonsudden cardiac death. The change in SBP during a 1-year period has no prognostic value. Because the beneficial effects of drugs associated with increased survival (in this study, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers) thus seem to be independent of their effects on BP, changes in BP should probably not influence the decision to use such drugs or continue their administration.",

All the six salts were subjected to a tiered screening involving five stages in the following order: crystallinity, hygroscopicity, solubility, stability and flow/compactability.

However, this treatment is aimed only at patients with advanced leaflet disease and symptoms of left ventricular obstruction. Over the past 15 years, our understanding of the pathogenesis of calcific aortic stenosis has changed significantly: away from a passive degenerative disease to an active process involving endothelial dysfunction, lipid accumulation, an inflammatory infiltrate, and a regulated process of calcification. Since many of the same processes are characteristic of atherosclerosis, trials have been undertaken to test whether medical therapy (statins, renin-angiotensin inhibition) can prevent or alter the disease course. Although retrospective and non-randomized studies suggested a positive effect with statins, benefit has not been seen in perspective randomized controlled trials, although two major studies are still in progress. Inhibition of renin-angiotensin has shown discordant results in retrospective studies with no randomized controlled data published. In the future, we need to consider other medical therapies that might target different pathways in this disease process. In addition, we need to define the optimal timing and duration of therapy for this chronic slowly progressive disease; treatments aimed at the early disease process may be ineffective with end-stage tissue changes.", 
    "301": "The extensive clinical experience of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin AT(1) receptor antagonists as antihypertensive agents provide numerous examples of anecdotal evidence of improvements in cognition and mood. This study aimed to determine the effect of chronic treatment with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, perindopril, and the angiotensin AT(1) receptor antagonist, candesartan, on central neurotransmitter levels in the rat. Perindopril (1.0mg/kg/day) or candesartan (10mg/kg/day) was administered via the drinking water at for 1 week, while controls received water alone. At the end of treatment rats were sacrificed, brains removed and discrete regions dissected and analysed for noradrenaline, dopamine and its major metabolites, and serotonin content. As shown previously we found an increase in striatal dopamine levels after perindopril treatment, though this did not extend to the mesolimbic system with neurotransmitter levels unchanged in the hippocampus, nucleus accumbens and frontal cortex. Conversely, candesartan administration produced no change in dopamine, but significant decreases in both DOPAC and HVA in the striatum. In addition chronic candesartan infusion produced a significant increase in the levels of hippocampal noradrenaline and serotonin; and frontal cortex serotonin content. These results demonstrate that while angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin AT(1) receptor antagonists act as antihypertensives by affecting the renin-angiotensin system, they have divergent actions on brain neurochemistry.", 
    "302": "We experienced 2 patients of valvular heart disease in Parkinson's patients taking cabergoline. Patient 1 was a 79-year-old woman who began taking 4 mg cabergoline daily after being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease (PD) in June 2003. She presented with dyspnea in November 2005. The patient had cardiomegaly, pulmonary congestion, and pleural effusion, and an echocardiogram showed valvular heart disease in the form of aortic regurgitation (AR) (grade I), tricuspid regurgitation (TR) (grade I), and mitral regurgitation (MR) (grade III). Cabergoline was thought to have caused these phenomena, so it was replaced with pramipexole, and after administration of diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) the patient's symptoms gradually disappeared. MR, AR and TR also disappeared 3 months later. Patient 2 was a 74-year-old woman who presented with sluggish movement in April 2001 and subsequently developed Parkinson's. While being administered 700 mg levodopa (Menesit) and 4 mg cabergoline, the patient presented with shortness of breath in April 2005. An echocardiogram showed valvular heart disease in the form of MR (grade I) and TR (grade I). Heart function improved with the administration of diuretics. However, heart function again worsened in November 2005, and the patient presented with edema of the lungs and lower limbs. An echocardiogram in January 2006 showed worsening MR (grade III) and TR (grade II), and the patient also had pulmonary hypertension. ACEIs were administered along with diuretics and cabergoline was replaced with pramipexole, but the patient also developed malignant syndrome and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and later died. Patient 2 is the first case in Japan of death due to heart failure caused by the side effects of cabergoline. Caution is usually needed when treating a Parkinson's patient for valvular heart disease due to a dopamine agonist, and periodic checks for heart murmurs and echocardiography are crucial. When signs of heart failure develop during treatment with an ergot preparation of dopamine agonist, it is essential to immediately either stop the administration of the ergot preparation or change to a non-ergot preparation of dopamine agonist.",

To further assess the impact of BP control or renin-angiotensin system inhibition on microalbuminuria, the SMART patients were re-analyzed. Hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria were randomly assigned to valsartan or amlodipine treatment groups for 24 weeks. Target blood pressure was set at <130/80 mmHg. Changes in the urinary albumin creatinine ratio (ACR) from baseline were assessed in the valsartan monotherapy (VM) group (n=33), the amlodipine monotherapy (AM) group (n=36), the concomitant valsartan and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor group (VA) (n=33), and the concomitant amlodipine and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (AA) group (n=38).

The changes in ACR from baseline to the end of the treatment period in VM, AM, VA, and AA were -36%, +30%, -26%, and +8%, respectively. The dissociation between the anti-albuminuric and antihypertensive effects of valsartan or amlodipine was observed in the respective monotherapy groups. In the AA group, however, a significant positive relationship was found between the changes in ACR and those in systolic BP. In conclusion, RAS inhibitors may be necessary in order for calcium channel blockers to have an effect on microalbuminuria. Therefore, RAS inhibitors are first-line drugs for hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria.", 
    "304": "A calcium channel blocker (CCB), azelnidipine (AZ), is reported to inhibit oxidative stresses, particularly when administered under blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). The purpose of this study was to investigate whether AZ inhibits oxidative stresses more potently than other CCBs under blockade of RAS and exerts renoprotection in type 2 diabetic nephropathy. Subjects were hypertensive type 2 diabetics with nephropathy, taking RAS inhibitors. The patients were randomly assigned to two groups, an AZ group (n=21, 16 mg/d) and a nifedipine-CR (NF) group (n=17, 40 mg/d). The plasma levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), adiponectin and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF(alpha)), the urinary excretion of 8-epi-prostaglandin F(2alpha) (8-epi-PGF(2alpha)) and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), and the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratios (ACR) were determined before and after 16-week treatment. Neither metabolic parameters nor blood pressure levels differed between the two groups not only at baseline but also after the treatment. However, significant decreases in MCP-1, IL-6, hsCRP, TNF(alpha), 8-epi-PGF(2alpha), 8-OHdG and ACR levels, and a significant increase in the plasma adiponectin level were detected in the AZ group, but not in the NF group. The % change in the urinary oxidative stress markers correlated with that in ACR. Our results indicate that, in hypertensive patients with diabetic nephropathy, a combination therapy of RAS inhibitors and AZ is an effective therapeutic modality for decreasing not only blood pressure but also inflammations and oxidative stresses.", 
    "305": "Renal diseases induce nephroprotective measures that may affect the heart, brain and other organs. In addition, many cardiovascular and neurological diseases are accompanied by renal lesions. For these reasons, multiorgan-protective measures, including cardio-, reno- and neuro-protective measures, are necessary to treat these diseases. The drugs used in nephrology are often pleiotropic. Although they usually address a single organ or tissue, many of them have complex actions that may provide multiorgan-protection. The present paper aims to review 3 classes of drugs that are commonly prescribed in nephrological practice: statins, RAS blockers (such as ACEIs and ARBs) and erythropoietin (EPO). This paper highlights the renoprotective actions, as well as those that are protective of the heart, brain and other organs, of these drugs at the cellular and molecular level. Their protective actions are attributable to their main effects and pleiotropic effects. The protective pleiotropic actions of these drugs may be exerted on multiple organs, making them multiorgan-protective. Another objective is to analyse the shared multiorgan-protective pleiotropic effects of RAS blockers (ACEIs and ARBs), statins and erythropoietin. This will allow for the practical association of the main renoprotective drugs with multiorgan protection.", 
    "306": "The recently published results of the ONTARGET trial shed a new light on the cardiovascular protection of patients at high risk of a cardiovascular event. Despite a number of trials looking at the efficacy of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme inhibitors (ACEis) or Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs) in the prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with specific high risk profiles, the question of the equivalence of ACEis and ARBs remained unanswered. The ONTARGET trial has shown that telmisartan 80 mg administered for a median duration of 4.5 years to patients at high risk of developing a major cardiovascular event, is equally effective to ramipril 10 mg. In addition, telmisartan was slightly better tolerated. The comparator ramipril has been chosen as it is currently the gold standard ACEi since the results of the HOPE study, in terms of the composite outcome of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction and stroke. Moreover, ONTARGET is the first trial to test the hypothesis of superiority of adding an ARB (telmisartan 80 mg) to an ACEi (ramipril 10 mg) over the ACEi ramipril monotherapy in cardiovascular protection of the same broad range of high-risk patients. Surprisingly, despite a more pronounced blood pressure lowering, the combination of the two agents did not lead to an additional decrease in the number of events, but had significantly more side-effects compared to ramipril monotherapy. ONTARGET is a landmark study, performed according to the highest statistical and clinical standards, providing compelling evidence and clear answers to two important clinical questions.", 
    "307": "Purpose of this work was to study renal function in white rats following a single dose of exogenous tiroxin (T4) on a background of non-selective NO-synthase blocker or inhibition of angiotensin-1 converting enzyme. The experiment was performed with males of outbred white rats (body mass = 140-180 g). Three days prior to T4 injection, the animals drank water solution of captopril (20 mg/l) or were injected intra-gastrically with water solution of non-selective NO-synthase blocker N(omega)-NLA (1 mg/100 g of body mass) over 3 days preceding T4 injection. A single dose of sodium chloride T4 on 1% starch gel (50 microg/100 g of body mass) was injected intragastrically; 5% water loading was given one hour later. Urine and plasma samples were analyzed for osmolality; creatinine, nitrites, nitrates and proteins were measured in urine samples. Tirozine was found to moderately decrease creatinine clearance and increase excretion of proteins, osmotically active substances (OAS), nitrites and nitrates with urine, and raise concentrations of stable nitrogen oxides, primarily nitrates in blood plasma. Pre-block of ACE by captopril intensified diuresis and inhibited renal excretion of OAS, nitrites and nitrates in response to T4 injection. However, captopril failed to prevent the decrease in creatinine clearance and the level of proteinuria. Pre-block of NO synthesis resulted in marked decreases in creatinine clearance, excretion of OAS and nitrites, and moderation of diuresis comparing with intact rats and rats treated with T4 only.", 
    "308": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are often regarded as substrates for the H+/peptide transporters (PEPT)1 and PEPT2. Even though the conclusions drawn from published data are quite inconsistent, in most review articles PEPT1 is claimed to mediate the intestinal absorption of ACE inhibitors and thus to determine their oral availability. We systematically investigated the interaction of a series of ACE inhibitors with PEPT1 and PEPT2. First, we studied the effect of 14 ACE inhibitors including new drugs on the uptake of the dipeptide [14C]glycylsarcosine into human intestinal Caco-2 cells constitutively expressing PEPT1 and rat renal SKPT cells expressing PEPT2. In a second approach, the interaction of ACE inhibitors with heterologously expressed human PEPT1 and PEPT2 was determined. In both assay systems, zofenopril and fosinopril were found to have very high affinity for binding to peptide transporters. Medium to low affinity for transporter interaction was found for benazepril, quinapril, trandolapril, spirapril, cilazapril, ramipril, moexipril, quinaprilat, and perindopril. For enalapril, lisinopril, and captopril, very weak affinity or lack of interaction was found. Transport currents of PEPT1 and PEPT2 expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes were recorded by the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique. Statistically significant, but very low currents were only observed for lisinopril, enalapril, quinapril, and benazepril at PEPT1 and for spirapril at PEPT2. For the other ACE inhibitors, electrogenic transport activity was extremely low or not measurable at all. The present results suggest that peptide transporters do not control intestinal absorption and renal reabsorption of ACE inhibitors.", 
    "309": "The N and C domains of somatic angiotensin-converting enzyme (sACE) differ in terms of their substrate specificity, inhibitor profiling, chloride dependency and thermal stability. The C domain is thermally less stable than sACE or the N domain. Since both domains are heavily glycosylated, the effect of glycosylation on their thermal stability was investigated by assessing their catalytic and physicochemical properties. Testis ACE (tACE) expressed in mammalian cells, mammalian cells in the presence of a glucosidase inhibitor and insect cells yielded proteins with altered catalytic and physicochemical properties, indicating that the more complex glycans confer greater thermal stabilization. Furthermore, a decrease in tACE and N-domain N-glycans using site-directed mutagenesis decreased their thermal stability, suggesting that certain N-glycans have an important effect on the protein's thermodynamic properties. Evaluation of the thermal stability of sACE domain swopover and domain duplication mutants, together with sACE expressed in insect cells, showed that the C domain contained in sACE is less dependent on glycosylation for thermal stabilization than a single C domain, indicating that stabilizing interactions between the two domains contribute to the thermal stability of sACE and are decreased in a C-domain-duplicating mutant.", 
    "310": "Micro-albuminuria is a marker for declining kidney function and predicts increasing cardiovascular risk especially in diabetic hypertensives. Angiotensin receptor blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may slow the progression of proteinuric kidney disease and thus would be valuable in these high risk patients. The present study was undertaken to assess the efficacy and tolerability of a fixed dose combination (FDC) of telmisartan and ramipril in adult Indian patients with sustained stage 2 hypertension, comorbidities and micro-albuminuria. A total 382 patients were enrolled in this multicentric, prospective open, non-comparative phase IV postmarketing surveillance study by 40 physicians in India and treated with FDC of telmisartan 40 mg+ ramipril 5 mg once daily for 12 weeks. A total 370 patients completed the study but 12 patients were lost to follow-up and considered as drop-outs. There was a significant (p<0.05) reduction in the systolic blood pressure (SBP) from 170.89 at baseline to 132. 77 mm Hg at week 12 and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) from 104.47 to 83.30 mm Hg at the end of 12 weeks therapy as well as urine albumin levels from 186.25 mg/24-hour to 62.42 mg/24-hour (66.49%) at the end of 12 weeks. Overall assessment of treatment was rated as good to excellent in 87.3% and fair in 11.4% patients. The most common adverse event reported was cough (5.2%). Results of the present study indicate that the FDC of telmisartan+ramipril brings about significant reductions in the systolic and diastolic blood pressure as well as urine albumin excretion.", 
    "311": "We compared the effects of telmisartan and olmesartan in 20 patients with chronic heart failure and metabolic syndrome. The subjects underwent once-daily 40 mg telmisartan for at least 3 months before switching to once-daily 20 mg olmesartan for the next 3 months (post 1). They were then treated with 3 months of once-daily 40 mg telmisartan (post 2). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure in the early morning, plasma B-type natriuretic peptide, serum total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride levels were increased at post 1 (p < 0.005, p < 0.05, p < 0.05, p < 0.05, p < 0.05, and p < 0.005 vs. baseline, respectively) before returning to their baseline values at post 2. The changes in plasma B-type natriuretic peptide levels correlated significantly with the shifts in systolic and diastolic blood pressure in the early morning at posts 1 and 2. Meanwhile, there were no fluctuations in either blood pressure in the late evening or in the outpatient room; nor were there fluctuations in heart rate. Simultaneously, neither serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol nor fasting blood sugar levels differed significantly between posts. Moreover, telmisartan had more beneficial effects on glucose and lipid profiles in patients with relatively high HbA1c, serum total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride levels. Therefore, we concluded that telmisartan was more beneficial than olmesartan for controlling blood pressure in the early morning, as well as for improving glucose and lipid profiles in patients with hypertension, chronic heart failure, and metabolic syndrome.", 
    "312": "The present study was conducted to compare the renal and vascular protective effects of telmisartan and amlodipine in untreated hypertensive chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients with moderate renal insufficiency. Thirty hypertensive CKD patients were randomly assigned to receive telmisartan 40 mg (n = 15) or amlodipine 5 mg (n = 15) once daily for 12 months. Changes in blood pressure, serum creatinine, 24-h creatinine clearance (Ccr), proteinuria, brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV), intima-media thickness (IMT), plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6), plasma matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and lipid profiles were monitored in all patients. Before treatment, there were no significant differences in these parameters between the telmisartan and amlodipine groups. Over the 12 month observation period, blood pressure decreased equally in both groups. However, serum creatinine, proteinuria, baPWV, IMT, plasma levels of IL-6 and MMP-9 and total cholesterol decreased and 24-h Ccr increased more strikingly in the telmisartan group than the amlodipine group. These data suggest that telmisartan is more effective than amlodipine for protecting renovascular functions, and potentially for ameliorating atherosclerosis, in hypertensive CKD patients with moderate renal insufficiency.", 
    "313": "Inflammation plays a key role in the pathogenesis of a number of chronic inflammatory systemic diseases (CISDs), including psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and Crohn's disease, and also in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. CISDs and cardiovascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis, share common pathogenic features, and cardiovascular disease is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with CISDs. Activated inflammatory cells and pro-inflammatory cytokines contribute to the development of psoriatic lesions and play an important role in the breakdown of atherosclerotic plaques. Psoriasis and atherosclerosis also have similar histological characteristics involving T cells, macrophages and monocytes. In particular, the extravasation of T cells through the epithelium is characteristic of both psoriatic and atherosclerotic plaques. Cardiovascular disease is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with psoriasis, which is associated with an increased cardiovascular risk profile compared with the general population. Patients with psoriasis are at increased risk of arterial hypertension, coronary heart disease, hyperlipidaemia, obesity and type II diabetes, which are more prevalent than in control patients. This increased risk could be due to the effects of chronic inflammatory changes, particularly the infiltration of T cells and subsequent secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Some drugs used in the treatment of cardiovascular disease, such as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have anti-inflammatory activity. In addition, systemic treatments for psoriasis may, by decreasing inflammation, reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. It is suggested, therefore, that an integrated approach to the treatment of the inflammatory processes underlying both psoriasis and atherosclerosis may be beneficial in reducing cardiovascular risk in patients with psoriasis. The newer targeted biological therapies, such as efalizumab and infliximab, which offer the potential for long-term disease control in psoriasis, may be of particular use in this setting.", 
    "314": "The incidence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) has been increasing, and within a 10-year period it is predicted that it will increase by 40 %. The main cause of death in this population of more than 50,000,000 individuals worldwide is cardiovascular disease. Increased urinary albumin is a predictor of renal failure, type 1 and type 2 diabetes; it correlates closely with mean arterial pressure in hypertensive subjects, predicts cardiovascular events and has a strong association with the metabolic syndrome. Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers can reduce progressive renal damage, the beneficial effect being partially independent of the blood pressure lowering actions. Various therapies have proved effective in reducing microalbuminuria and progressive renal damage, demonstrating that the risk factor associated with a clinical outcome decreases with appropriate treatment. Cardiovascular events are the main cause of death in most patients with chronic renal disease. Diabetes, hypertension, obesity and smoking further increase the likelihood of vascular damage. Screening target populations of people with diabetes or hypertension is well recognized. Studies in several countries that have tested for albuminuria in unselected populations have demonstrated associations between microalbuminuria and deteriorating renal function, with the risk of developing ESRD and cardiovascular outcomes. There is some evidence for the use of urinary albumin as a marker of kidney involvement in unselected populations, but this needs to be strengthened and it may be cost effective compared with no screening. This has the potential to have a major impact in developing countries facing the challenges of chronic kidney disease, diabetes and cardiovascular disease.",

Additionally, ACE inhibitors have been shown to retard the progression of SLE and lupus nephritis. Our goal was to investigate whether ACE gene polymorphisms are associated with increasing severity of SLE. We genotyped 39 SLE patients of varying disease severity from a homogenous Asian population and 79 control subjects for ACE I/D and 2350 G > A dimorphisms. All patients met the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for SLE and their disease severity was measured using Systemic Lupus Activity Measure (SLAM). The \"A\" allele was found to be associated with increase in severity of SLE with the AA genotype present only in severe disease. No association with SLE in general, compared to healthy subjects, was found with either dimorphism. We also examined the transmission of haplotypes as defined by these polymorphisms. The D and A alleles were found in strong linkage disequilibrium especially in severe SLE. The DA-haplotype was more frequent in severe SLE, than mild to moderate disease. Our findings suggest that DNA sequence variation in the ACE gene influences disease progression and severity of SLE.",

However, NO and cGMP levels were significantly higher than that with Ang II alone (both P < 0.01). 1 micromol/L HOE-140 or 0.1 micromol/L des-Arg(10), Leu(9)-kallidin attenuated the effects of captopril, which was blunted further by blockade of both B(1) and B(2) receptors.",

Central to this role is the production of endothelium-derived nitric oxide (EDNO), synthesized by the endothelial isoform of nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). Endothelial dysfunction, manifested as impaired EDNO bioactivity, is an important early event in the development of various vascular diseases, including hypertension, diabetes, and atherosclerosis. The degree of impairment of EDNO bioactivity is a determinant of future vascular complications. Accordingly, growing interest exists in defining the pathologic mechanisms involved. Considerable evidence supports a causal role for the enhanced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by vascular cells. ROS directly inactivate EDNO, act as cell-signaling molecules, and promote protein dysfunction, events that contribute to the initiation and progression of endothelial dysfunction. Increasing data indicate that strategies designed to limit vascular ROS production can restore endothelial function in humans with vascular complications. The purpose of this review is to outline the various ways in which ROS can influence endothelial function and dysfunction, describe the redox mechanisms involved, and discuss approaches for preventing endothelial dysfunction that may highlight future therapeutic opportunities in the treatment of cardiovascular disease.",

    "340": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD), a major worldwide public-health problem which affects about 10% of the population, has an increased annual incidence rate of about 5-8%. This increased incidence is mainly due to type 2 diabetes and hypertension and the increasing incidence of elderly patients with CKD. Although the progression to end-stage renal failure (ESRF) is mainly based upon the underlying disease, comorbid conditions such as an initial low renal function, severe proteinuria, and high levels of blood pressure also play important roles in the development of ESRF. Since experimental and clinical evidence suggest that angiotensin II plays a central role in the progression of CKD, pharmacological inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosteron system (RAAS) with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antagonists has been suggested as first-line treatment for hypertension and prevention of ESRF in these patients. Aliskiren, a novel renin inhibitor is also a promising medical intervention. However, independently of the category of the drugs used, low target blood pressure levels seem to be equally or more important for the delay or prevention of CKD. In this review the results of studies with pharmacological inhibition of the RAAS in patients with diabetic and nondiabetic nephropathy is discussed.",

One of the most serious consequences of KD is the development of arterial aneurysms that can lead to thrombosis and ischemia. Commonly, these lesions, occurring early in the course of KD, are found in the coronary arteries. However, this location is not exclusive. This report presents a case of KD with atypical findings of a late-appearing brachiocephalic artery aneurysm. The authors suggest that for patients with complicated KD, surveillance should include a careful vascular survey to discover aneurysms distant from the heart.", 
    "342": "Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) offer a new treatment alternative for patients with hypertension and heart failure. Due to comparatively high prices, most guidelines suggest ARBs be restricted to patients intolerant to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi).

It accounts for 22% of cardiovascular deaths in urban areas and 13% in rural areas. Although mortality from CHD in China is relatively low compared with Western levels, the burden of CHD has been increasing. This is partly because of a worsening profile of risk factors, such as an increased prevalence of hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, overweight/obesity, diabetes, etc and partly because of an increase in the aged population. Large-scale, randomised controlled trials on thrombolytic, blood-pressure-lowering, antiplatelet and blood-cholesterol-lowering treatment as well as cardiac intervention have been conducted for Chinese patients with myocardial infarction. The studies provide important information for the prevention and management of chronic CHD and acute myocardial infarction in the Chinese population.",

The goals of the study were to calculate a rate of SRs to AIT, characterize the timing and treatment of these SRs, and analyze a case-control sample of patients for putative SR risk factors. A case-control study based on a retrospective chart review from 2004 to 2006 at a single institution was performed for patients receiving AIT. A control group received AIT over the same time period but did not have an SR. Three hundred thirty-eight patients had 10,497 AIT injection visits and 25 patients experienced 29 SRs for a rate of 0.28% per injection visit and 7.4% per patient. Gender, phase (build-up versus maintenance), asthma, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers, initial skin-prick test size, or allergen type did not increase the odds of an SR to AIT. Nearly one-half (48%) of the SRs occurred >30 minutes after the injection. All five patients with an abnormal physical exam or a >20% decrease in peak expiratory flow during their SRs occurred in patients presenting with their SRs >30 minutes after the injection (p = 0.02). This study found a low rate of SRs to AIT. However, a high percentage of SRs occurred >30 minutes after the injection, and many of these SRs required epinephrine. This study was unable to identify specific risk factors that predict SRs to AIT.",

The collected time-dependent FT-IR spectra at each isothermal temperature were preprocessed and analyzed using a multivariate chemometric approach. The pure component spectra of the observable component (lisinopril and diketopiperazine) were resolved and their time-dependent relative contributions were also determined.

Additionally, the patients having any occlusion or stenoses in their carotid and/or intracranial arteries, or even in old-old patients with atherosclerosis, might need further consideration for the cerebral blood flow insufficiency in the course of blood pressure lowering therapy. Although the advantages of inhibitors of renin-angiotensin system are lionized these days (advertisement based medicine: ABM), we should never forget to select more favorable antihypertensive drugs for each patient in case by case (individual based medicine: IBM), to get the definite blood pressure lowering effects without worsening any complications.

The animals were divided into eight experimental groups. Mirtazapine (5 and 10 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally for 14 days. Twenty-four hours after the last administration of the drug, the rats received a single intraperitoneal dose of hypotensive drugs (propranolol 5 mg/kg or enalapril 10 mg/kg) or 1% solution of methylcellulose.

Enalaprilate did not affect the FS activity. Captopril considerably inhibited the amidase activities of urokinase (u-PA), plasminogen tissue activator (t-PA), and plasmin ([I]50 (2.0-2.6) +/- 0.1 mM), and the activation of Glu-plasminogen affected by t-PA and u-PA ([I]50 (1.50-1.80) +/- 0.06 mM), which may be due to the presence of a mercapto group in the inhibitor molecule. Lisinopril did not affect the amidase activities of FS enzymes, but stimulated Glu-plasminogen and u-PA activation and inhibited activation of t-PA-fibrin-bound Glu-plasminogen ([I]50 (12.0 +/- 0.5) mM). Presumably, these effects can be explained by the presence in lisinopril of a Lys side residue, whose binding to lysine-binding Glu-plasminogen centers resulted, on the one hand, in the transformation of its closed conformation to a semi-open one and, on the other hand, in its desorption from fibrin. Unspecific inhibition of the activity of ACE, a key enzyme of the renin-angiotensin system, in the presence of 6-AHA and t-AMCHA ([I]50 10.0 +/- 0.5 and 7.5 +/- 0.4 mM, respectively) was found. A decrease in the ACE activity along with the growth of the fibrin monomer concentration was revealed.

In contrast to the other RAAS antagonists, aliskiren shuts down the entire downstream RAAS cascade.

    "391": "Studied nature of the \"blood vessels relaxing factor\" derived from endothelium that was identified as nitric oxide caused intensive scientific research on nitric oxide regarding some aspects of its impact on human physiological and pathological processes. The objective of this short review is to discuss widely used (in the clinical practice) direct and indirect donors of nitric oxide and/or other agents, increasing nitric oxide concentration in human body, and their beneficial role for the prevention of atherosclerosis. Under physiological conditions, endothelium regulates the tone of blood vessels, homeostasis of which is maintained by endothelium-generated vasoconstrictors and vasodilators. The most important vasodilator and the main substance produced by the endothelium is nitric oxide. The failure of synthesis and/or the lost of nitric oxide bioavailability is the major feature of endothelial dysfunction and key factor initiating progression of atherosclerosis. The endothelial dysfunction initiates the series of events, which stimulate and aggravate the course of atherosclerosis by increasing endothelial permeability, platelet aggregation, and leukocyte adhesion, and cytokine expression. Further, the review deals with the mechanisms of action of statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, L-arginine, direct nitric oxide donors (nitroglycerin, isosorbide mononitrate and isosorbide dinitrate), and indirect nitric oxide donors (phosphodiesterase-V inhibitors, K(ATP) openers).",

Advances in rhinitis include the realization that allergic rhinitis might be caused by local nasal IgE sensitization to aeroallergens in the absence of systemic evidence of IgE sensitization. After inhalation, allergens might reach systemic circulation. Epidemiologic studies continue to show that allergic rhinitis impairs school performance and is a risk factor for future asthma. New pathways are being identified in chronic sinusitis, as well as in different types of allergic ocular diseases. New treatments for patients with allergic rhinitis include use of beta-1,3-glucan, a mushroom product that can reduce allergic symptoms by inducing T(H)1 response, and olopatadine nasal spray. Studies on immunotherapy in 2007 suggest that sublingual immunotherapy induces similar immunologic alterations as those induced by subcutaneous immunotherapy, although to a lesser degree. Among allergists in the United States, there is a sizable variation in clinical practice, particularly related to concomitant administration of immunotherapy and beta-blockers, to administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and to patients with HIV or autoimmune diseases. The combination of omalizumab with allergen subcutaneous immunotherapy can enhance clinical efficacy. Recombinant technology can modify allergen structure to prevent binding to IgE (allergenicity) while enhancing immunogenicity (stimulation of T cells), which might improve the safety and efficacy of immunotherapy.",

We retrospectively evaluated the impact of early (3 and 6 months after transplantation) proteinuria, urinary albumin excretion (UAE) and arterial pressure on NODAT in 828 Caucasian renal transplant recipients (median follow-up: 5.3 years; 5832 patient-years). The 10- and 20-year incidence of NODAT was 15.0% and 22.0%, respectively. Low-grade (<1 g/day) (HR: 2.04 [1.25-3.33], p = 0.0042) and very low-grade (<0.3 g/day) (HR: 2.21 [1.32-3.70], p = 0.0025) proteinuria were independent risk factors for NODAT. There was a dose-dependent relationship across UAE categories (increasing risk from normoalbuminuria to macroalbuminuria) with NODAT. Tacrolimus, sirolimus and beta-blockers (HR: 1.86 [1.07-3.22], p = 0.0277) were significantly associated with NODAT even after multiple adjustments, but not diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers. Systolic arterial pressure (HR per 10 mmHg: 1.16 [1.03-1.29], p = 0.0126) and pulse pressure (HR: 1.26 [1.12-1.43], p = 0.0002) were associated with NODAT. Only pulse pressure remained significant after adjustments. Patients at highest risks had early proteinuria and pulse pressure >60 mmHg. Early low-grade proteinuria and pulse pressure (in addition to beta-blockers) constitute independent risk factors for NODAT; they may be markers of the metabolic syndrome and/or vascular damage in renal transplant recipients.", 
    "394": "Hypertension is the most common risk factor for cardiovascular disease, constituting the most common cause of death in industrialized countries. Therefore, the task of blood pressure reduction has significant importance in reducing vascular damage, myocardial infarctions, kidney damage and incidence of cerebrovascular accidents. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays a central role in control and function of the cardiovascular and renal systems, and is deeply involved in the pathophysiology of diseases of vasculature, heart, kidneys and others. Therefore, blockade of RAAS by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and blockers of angiotensin II type AT1 receptors (ARBs) is widely utilized by clinicians. Indeed, it has long been known that ACE inhibitors and ARBs protect different targets of angiotensin II, due to impedance of the negative effects of the hormone and the inhibition of aldosterone production, which contributes both directly and indirectly to the damages, independent of angiotensin II. Despite this, the morbidity and mortality resulting from the progression of cardiovascular diseases in patients treated with ACE inhibitors or ARBs remain high. As such, over the years, much effort has been dedicated to the development of direct inhibitors of renin. The earliest renin inhibitors, developed 30 years ago were not effective due to their protein nature, which prevents their oral administration and limited their clinical use. In the last decade, several non-protein renin inhibitors which could be given orally were developed, of which Aliskiren is the most well known representative. Due to the fact that neutralization of the RAAS by ACE inhibitors and ARBs has been reviewed at length many times, this review will focus on the renewed subject of renin inhibition. The earliest research, both in humans as well as in animal models, show that Aliskiren has therapeutic potential in treatment of patients with hypertension, cardiovascular disease and renal disease. However, the efficacy of Aliskiren in treating systolic and diastolic hypertension in patients was not better than that obtained using ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Even so, there is no need to lower levels of optimism for potential therapy using direct inhibitors of renin. Current research is still in its early stages and there is a need to remember that it took many years to prove the clinical usefulness of ACE inhibitors, which are now central to treatment of cardiovascular and renal diseases, including hypertension.", 
    "395": "Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), through their physiological blockade of the renin-angiotensin system, reduce morbidity and mortality associated with hypertension, heart failure, myocardial infarction, stroke, diabetic nephropathy, and chronic kidney disease. Among many attributes, excellent tolerability, and their ability to control hypertension for 24 hours with a positive effect on renal function position them as a useful choice for hypertension and related conditions. Because of the widespread actions of the renin-angiotensin system on critical tissues, treatment with ARBs may be beneficial in special populations. Ongoing and future studies will be needed to conclusively determine if ARBs also improve outcomes in patients with heart failure and preserved systolic function, atrial fibrillation, cognitive dysfunction, and kidney transplant recipients. Preliminary clinical data also suggest that combining ARBs and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may provide a more optimal blockade of the renin-angiotensin system and, therefore, may offer greater cardio- and nephroprotection. Future data will help delineate which ARBs and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are best combined and which patient populations might benefit from the dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "396": "Silkworm pupae protein is a good source of high quality protein. The hydrolyzates of silkworm pupae protein catalyzed by neutrase, pepsin, acidic protease (Asperqiius usamii NO. 537), flavourzyme, alcalase, and trypsin with inhibitory activity on angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) were identified by HPLC. The hydrolyzates catalyzed by acidic protease exerted the highest inhibitory activity on ACE. The hydrolyzing conditions were optimized by one-factor, factional factorial (FFD), and center composite (CCD) design methods, and response surface methodology (RSM). Statistical analyses showed that regression of the second-order model equation is suitable to describe ACE inhibitory bioactivity. The predicted inhibitory activity of hydrolyzates on ACE was 73.5 % at a concentration of 2.0 mg/ml. Optimized RSM technique decreased IC(50) of hydrolyzates inhibiting ACE to 1.4 mg/mL from 2.5 mg/ml. The molecular weight of the components of the hydrolyzates with inhibitory activity on ACE varied from less than 500 to about 1000 Da by ultra-filter analysis. These studies suggest that hydrolyzates of silkworm protein contain ACE inhibitory activity that could form a potential source of ACE inhibitor drugs.", 
    "397": "Cardiovascular diseases are common and occur mainly in the elderly in whom osteoporotic fractures also are very common. Because of this, it is of importance to establish whether drugs used in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases affect bone, in order to minimise any possible adverse effects. In the majority of studies, treatment with thiazide diuretics, statins, digoxin, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors, and organic nitrates have not been associated with harmful effects on bone. On the contrary, treatment with these drugs may improve bone strength but because there is a lack of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with fracture as a primary outcome measure, these drugs should not be prescribed for fracture prevention. In RCTs, treatment with loop diuretics have been shown to increase plasma levels of parathyroid hormone and decrease bone mineral density. In epidemiological studies, treatment with loop diuretics as well as treatment with amiodarone has been associated with an increased risk of fracture. In view of the conflicting results from published studies, no conclusions can be drawn on potential bone effects of treatment with oral anticoagulants, beta-blockers, and calcium channel blockers.", 
    "398": "Age related macular degeneration (AMD) is a progressive degenerative disease affecting central vision. Recent studies have shown that that statins may lower the risk of AMD potentially due to statins' anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties. We sought to further explore this association and also explore the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) with respect to the development of AMD.", 
    "399": "We conducted a nested case-control study within a cardiovascular cohort that had undergone revascularization interventions in the Province of Quebec, Canada. Cases were identified as those with an ICD-9 code for AMD. For each case, four controls were randomly chosen from the cohort and matched to the cases by age and calendar time. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate rate ratios and adjust for potential confounders.", 
    "400": "Our nested case-control study consisted of 2,867 cases and 11,468. Current users of ACE-Is or statins were at a slightly higher risk of developing AMD (1.19 [1.07-1.33]) and (1.30 [1.17-1.44]) respectively. The results were similar for those using these drugs in the year prior.", 
    "401": "Based on the results of our study, statin and ACE-I use may be associated with an increase in the risk of AMD. Given that our study is an observational study, further studies are required to confirm or refute these findings.", 
    "402": "A newly synthesized substrate, 3-hydroxybutyrylglycyl-glycyl-glycine (3HB-GGG), was applied to the assay of ACE-inhibiting activity to overcome the smaller selectivity and sensitivity of the conventional method. In this study, an ACE-inhibiting assay was improved by the use of a water-soluble tetrazolium salt, 4-[3-(4-iodophenyl)-2-(4-nitrophenyl)-2H-5-tetrazolio]-1,3-benzene disulfonate sodium salt (WST-1), for the detection of 3-hydroxybutyrate, derived from 3HB-GGG. The optimized conditions were as follows: 0.333 mM NAD(+), 0.333 mM WST-1, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.633 U ml(-1) diaphorase, and 0.700 U ml(-1) 3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase. The developed assay was efficiently applicable to evaluate the ACE-inhibiting activity of practical ACE inhibitors.",

Thirteen cases of C1qN from 212 (6.6%) native biopsies and one case out of 52 (1.9%) transplant biopsies were reviewed regarding demographic features, clinical presentation, histopathology, treatment, and outcome. Age varied from 1 to 18 years; half were boys. Ten children (71.4%) presented with nephrotic syndrome (NS). The most common histopathology found was diffuse mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis (DMP) by light microscopy (LM), with diffuse granular staining for C1q predominantly in the mesangium. Children with either NS or persistent gross hematuria received prednisone and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) (11). Median follow-up was 36 months. Steroid response was complete in 6 patients (54.5%). Those with steroid resistance (5) or steroid dependence (2) received further immunosuppression with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or tacrolimus (Tac). Three children achieved complete remission and four partial remission. Frequent relapses were seen in 4/14 patients. Renal survival was 100%. Our report reveals a high incidence of C1qN in pediatric patients, with variable clinical presentation. Despite a high incidence of steroid resistance among those with NS, an excellent response was observed with the addition of further immunosuppression.",

First, the patient was treated with angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI). Proteinuria decreased from 10 to 6 g/day, but overall the nephrotic syndrome did not improve. Additional treatment with prednisolone and cyclosporine reduced proteinuria to less than 1.0 g/day. We report that combination therapy with ARB, ACEI, prednisolone, and cyclosporine was successful for FSGS complicating solitary kidney.",

In placebo-controlled trials, those commonly reported for aliskiren at the approved dosage were headache, diarrhea, for personal and fatigue, with incidences similar to those of placebo. Aliskiren has been well tolerated in black, geriatric, diabetic, or obese patients and patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Aliskiren neither inhibits nor induces the cytochrome P450 system; it does not inhibit P-glycoprotein, but is a substrate for this drug transporter. Adding a direct renin inhibitor to another renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitor may further improve cardiovascular outcomes, renal outcomes, or both, without increasing the incidence of adverse effects.", 
    "409": "Aliskiren is well tolerated, has an adverse effect profile comparable to that of placebo, and has a low potential for drug interactions. Data from ongoing trials evaluating the effects of aliskiren on surrogate markers, morbidity, and mortality will further define the role of direct renin inhibition in the antihypertensive armamentarium.", 
    "410": "Hypertension is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), including stroke, myocardial infarction, kidney disease and heart failure. Considerable research has been undertaken to delineate the differential effects of various classes of antihypertensive agents in delaying or preventing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Although possible benefits may result from specific agents or classes of agents in certain high-risk subgroups, prompt and intensive blood pressure (BP) reduction to target levels remains the most crucial factor in this benefit. Despite this, the BP remains above the target level in a large majority of patients, reinforcing the need for improved treatment paradigms. Among antihypertensive agents, inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system--angiotensin-II receptor blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors--and long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (DHP-CCBs) have been shown to provide safe, effective and well-tolerated BP control. These agents have also been proven as effective as, and in some cases superior to, other classes of agents in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. As the majority of high-risk patients require at least two and possibly even three medications to achieve the target BP, combination therapy with these two classes of drugs is a rational approach to therapy. Whether fixed-dose combination therapy with a renin-angiotensin system inhibitor plus a DHP-CCB affords greater clinical benefit compared with other combination regimens remains to be determined in large, prospective clinical trials. Meanwhile, such a combination offers effective, convenient, well-tolerated control of the most important modifiable risk factor for CVD.",

This review therefore includes recent advances in cardiac treatment as well as interventions directed solely at dyspnoea management although dyspnoea is rarely a primary endpoint in cardiac trials.Improved understanding of pathophysiology has led to the development of novel drugs. Currently their role, be it in disease management or symptom benefit, acute decompensation or stable disease, is unclear.Cardiac resynchronization therapy appears to be helpful for both symptom control and survival. The importance of monitoring cardiac status and fluid balance is well recognized, and may be further optimized by home telemonitoring. For dyspnoea, nonpharmacological interventions such as exercise rehabilitation or use of a fan may be helpful. There is a small evidence base for the use of opioids, but in general, pharmacological management specifically for dyspnoea remains underresearched.",

The adverse effects brought by the chronic assumption of drugs can be a potential limit. Actually, the most used therapies for IgAN are renin-angiotensin system blockers (RASB), glucocorticoids and immunosuppressive agents. Trials with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in IgAN have been done since the first successful attempt by Hamazaki in 1984, resulting in alternate answers, but no trials have ever been done testing the efficacy of combined therapy with RASB and PUFA.", 
    "415": "We tested the effect of a 6-month course of PUFA (3 grams/day) in a group of 30 patients with biopsy-proven IgAN and proteinuria already treated with RASB randomized to receive PUFA supplementation or to continue their standard therapy. The primary end-point was the percent reduction of proteinuria from the baseline. Secondary end-points were modifications in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), blood pressure, serum triglycerides and erythrocyturia.",

    "418": "Three pathways are critically involved in blood pressure regulation during anaesthesia, i.e. the sympathetic nervous system, the renin angiotensin system (RAS), and the vasopressinergic system. The fact that anaesthetic agents typically blunt the regulatory role of the adrenergic system emphasises the importance of the remaining compensatory mechanisms. In patients chronically treated with RAS antagonists, such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists, however, this mechanism is also blunted, possibly resulting in absolute dependency of blood pressure regulation on the vasopressinergic system. To date, several small-scale clinical trials demonstrated the efficacy of V1 receptor agonists in reversing perioperative catecholamine-refractory hypotension in patients with chronic RAS blockade. Therefore, perioperative administration of a V1 agonist, such as terlipressin, may be a rational approach to treat severe hypotension non-responsive to conventional treatment strategies. In the absence of catecholamine resistance and RAS blockade, administration of V1 agonists may contribute to a dose-dependent reduction in regional splanchnic vasoconstriction. Likewise, bolus infusion may result in coronary vasospasm and is thus not recommended for routine clinical use. Future large-scale randomized, controlled clinical trials are warranted to evaluate the role of V1 agonists in the treatment of perioperative hypotension in more detail.",

Patients with poor clinical outcome were older, had higher The New York Heart Association functional class, impaired right ventricular ejection fraction and left ventricular ejection fraction, and impaired cardiac I-123 MIBG uptake. On multivariate analysis, I-123 MIBG heart-to-mediastinum (H/M) uptake ratio <1.6 was the only predictor of both primary (cardiac death or heart transplantation, RR = 7.02, p < 0.01) and secondary (cardiac death, heart transplantation, or recurrent heart failure, RR = 8.10, p = 0.0008) end points.",

However, urinary albumin excretion, glomerular filtration rate and glomerulosclerosis were significantly improved in the enalapril group and improvement was observed in a dose-dependent manner in the eplerenone groups; the most dramatic decreases were observed in the combination group. In accordance with these findings, renal expressions of TGF-beta1, type IV collagen and PAI-1 were also markedly decreased in the treatment groups, with the combined treatment providing the most significant level of improvement.

However, the incidence of inducible VAs in the MI-captopril group was lower (27.2%, 3/11) than in the MI-placebo group (P < 0.05). Proliferation and growth of nerve fibres in the MI-placebo group were mainly distributed at the periphery of the infarcted and perivascular regions of the myocardium. The density of nerve fibres increased in the MI-placebo group (3889+/-521 microm2/mm2) compared with the sham group (1727+/-304 microm2/mm2, P < 0.01) at the infarct border. In the MI-captopril group, the density of nerve fibres (3507+/-433 microm2/mm2) at the infarct border did not differ from that in the MI-placebo group (P=0.07).

Although different aspects of general practice characteristics have been studied previously, the impact of practice size on the delivery of care has been sparsely studied, particularly in relation to diabetes care. This brief report presents a longitudinal study in Shropshire (66 practices, 16,858 patients with diabetes) to assess the impact of practice size on diabetes care before and after implementation of the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF). Achievement of glycaemic control targets was better before the QOF for larger as compared to smaller practices (P=0.02 and P=0.003 for haemoglobin A1c [HbA1c]<or=7.4% and 10% respectively). This difference disappeared following QOF implementation. Repeated measures analysis showed significant improvement in achieving glycaemic control targets following QOF implementation in both large and small practices (P<0.001 for HbA1c<or=7.4% and 10%). The study failed to reveal an impact of practice size on achieving the HbA1c target<or=7.4% (P=0.1) by this analysis. However, it did show an impact on reaching the target of HbA1c<10% (P=0.04) in favour of smaller practices.

    "439": "Three hours of pulsatile atmospheric pressure resulted in an approximately 8% increase in cell proliferation of human aortic smooth muscle cells. The cell surface ACE level, enzyme activity and mRNA expression were all elevated (37%, 110% and 17%, respectively) under pressurized conditions, and co-administration of AII reduced all these values. The reductions in these three parameters resulting from the administration of AII were all abolished by AII receptor blocker co-administration and values were increased (11%, 62% and 12%, respectively) under pressurized conditions. Pulsatile atmospheric pressure increased the amount of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) by approximately 54% in HASMCs.

RI was compared to the ARB, candesartan (3 mg/kg/day PO), and to the ACEI, enalapril (60 mg/kg/day PO) in a 4-week dosing paradigm.

    "444": "Dementia has been increasing exponentially in recent years, especially in Asia. This increasing prevalence calls for the necessity of antecedent biomarkers. The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene, located on chromosome 17q23, has been regarded as a candidate susceptibility gene for Alzheimer's disease (AD), because ACE could degrade beta-amyloid, the pathological hallmark of AD, thereby inhibiting its aggregation. The level and activity of ACE, in part, may be modulated by the insertion or deletion (indel) polymorphism of ACE gene. The indel polymorphism, consisting of the presence or absence of a 287-bp DNA fragment, has been considered the biomarker of AD, although its validity varies with race. In the Japanese, seemingly different results have been reported. One report shows significant association of insertion homozygote with AD, whereas other shows no association of indel polymorphism with AD. In the Taiwanese, the significant association of deletion homozygote with AD was found. Moreover, clinical studies have shown that using ACE inhibitors could slow the deterioration of cognitive function in AD patients, despite that ACE can degrade beta-amyloid. These heterogeneous results on the association of ACE gene with AD and clinical significance of using ACE inhibitor in AD highlight the necessity of exploring detailed mechanisms from the ACE gene to the development of AD. These detailed mechanisms and findings may serve as the basis for further study.", 
    "445": "For more than 200 years digitalis has been considered of paramount importance in the treatment of heart failure and atrial fibrillation. The IN-CHF Italian registry shows that prescriptions were reduced from 63.3% in the period 1995-1999 to 40% in the period 2000-2005, a very different trend compared to prescriptions of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor antagonists, and beta-blockers. The commercial value of digitalis is much lower than other drugs and it does not seem to be of interest for the pharmaceutical companies. Unfortunately, this is a logical trend in the business world. For many years the major indications of digitalis have been heart failure and atrial fibrillation. The most important study on efficacy of digitalis in the treatment of heart failure was the DIG trial (1997), which showed no difference in mortality when compared to placebo but significant beneficial effects in reducing hospital admission rates. Many post-hoc researches evaluated blood levels of digitalis and proved beneficial effects also on mortality when digoxinemia values were 0.5-0.9 ng/ml. In conclusion, digitalis should still be considered effective for the treatment of heart failure; therefore prescription modality as well as the range of normal values of digoxinemia should be updated.",

During a mean follow-up of 8.6 +/- 5.5 years, mean LVEF and left ventricular end-diastolic diameter improved from 30.6 +/- 7.9% to 58.3 +/- 6.5% (p < 0.0001) and 57.5 +/- 7.0 mm to 44.6 +/- 5.5 mm (p < 0.0001), respectively Fifteen of the 18 patients (83%) had a history of hypertension. Systolic blood pressure at the initial referral clinic correlated with improved contractility (p = 0.0275, r = 0.52).

Frailty is a clinical syndrome that geriatricians attach great importance to. Like many other diseases chronic heart failure can cause frailty. Based on the experience that we see only a small correlation between the functional capacity of patients with heart failure and the results of cardiological findings, the model of peripheral myopathy in chronic heart failure was developed. Different pathophysiological changes may cause the increasing exercise intolerance in patients with chronic heart failure. We can already consider different experimental approaches to the therapy of frailty caused by chronic heart failure. At the moment we have to focus our efforts on an optimal therapy of heart failure, especially with angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers, and on individual endurance and strength training.",

As most probably similar or identical etiopathogenetic mechanisms are involved in different atherosclerotic diseases, a different effect of treatment of risk factors on atherosclerotic lesions in different parts of the vascular system is expected. Until now, great emphasis has been placed on the aggressive pharmacological management of coronary artery disease, less attention has been devoted to the management of cerebrovascular and much less to peripheral arterial disease, despite their significant morbidity and mortality. The data from recent trials have indicated that treatment of patients with antiplatelet drugs, statins, antihypertensive and antidiabetic drugs prevents the progression of coronary atherosclerosis, reduces cardiovascular events and improves prognosis of coronary patients. Subgroup analyses from large studies have also shown that treatment of risk factors for atherosclerosis with drugs reduces cardiovascular events and improves prognosis of cerebrovascular and peripheral arterial occlusive disease. Although some studies indicate that the effects of distinct preventive procedures are to some extent dependent on the locations of atherosclerotic disease, it seems that the success of preventive measures is mostly related to the progression of the disease or the risk of treated population and not on the treated vascular bed.",

Subsequent examinations or interviews occurred in 1998 to 2000 (n = 2827) and 2003 to 2005 (n = 2124). The incidence cohort comprised 2414 subjects not reporting dry eye in 1993 to 1995. Risk factor information, ascertained in 1993 to 1995, included demographics, medical history, cardiovascular disease risk factors, medications, and life-style factors. Ten-year cumulative incidence was estimated by the product-limit method.", 
    "451": "Over the 10-year period, 482 subjects developed a history of dry eye for an incidence of 21.6% (95% confidence interval, 19.9 to 23.3%). Incidence increased significantly (p < 0.001) with age. Incidence was greater in women (25.0%) than men (17.2%, p < 0.001). After adjusting for age, incidence was greater (p < 0.05) in subjects with arthritis, allergy or thyroid disease not treated with hormone, using antihistamines, antianxiety medications, antidepressants, oral steroids or vitamins, and poorer self-rated health. Incidence was less (p < 0.05) in subjects consuming alcohol. It was not significantly associated with blood pressure, hypertension, serum total or high density lipoprotein cholesterol, body mass, diabetes, gout, osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, smoking, caffeine use, or taking calcium channel blockers or anticholesterol medications. In a multivariable model with time-varying covariates, increased incidence was associated with age, female gender, poorer self-rated health, antidepressant or oral steroid use, and thyroid disease untreated with hormone. It was lower for those using angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or with a sedentary lifestyle.",

This study examines possible interactions between nine such genotype polymorphisms and their combinatory effect in assessing the OSCC risk in a European population. OSCC cases (N=162) and healthy controls (N=168) of comparable age, gender, and ethnicity (Greeks and Germans) were studied. Multivariate logistic regression models were constructed in order to assess the contribution of homozygous or heterozygous variant genotypes of polymorphisms MMP-1 (-1607 1G/2G), MMP-3 (-1171 5A/6A), MMP-9 (-1562C/T), TIMP-2 (-418C/G), VEGF (+936C/T), GPI-alpha (+807C/T), PAI-1 (4G/5G), ACE (intron 16D/I) and TAFI (+325C/T) upon overall, early and advanced stages of OSCC. Four out of nine polymorphisms affecting PAI-1, MMP-9, TIMP-2 and ACE expression contributed significantly in OSCC prediction in the various logistic regression models. Based on these findings and previous reports, possible interactions of the implicated factors leading to OSCC development, as well as an algorithm of risk estimation are discussed.", 
    "463": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a key role in the regulation of cardiovascular and renal function. Thus, RAS blockade with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and/or angiotensin receptor blocker decreases blood pressure, cardiovascular events, and delays the progression of kidney disease. The discovery of ACE2, a homologue of ACE, capable of degrading angiotensin II to angiotensin 1-7, may offer new insights into the RAS. In this review we discuss the possible protective role of ACE2 in different organs, namely heart, lungs and kidneys. The role of this enzyme is inferred from recent studies performed using genetically manipulated mice that lack the ACE2 gene and also mice treated with pharmacological ACE2 inhibitors. These results suggest that ACE2 might be a new therapeutic target within the RAS.", 
    "464": "Correlations of atherosclerotic plaque attributes with clinical presentation have not been studied in peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The aim of the current study was to identify clinical variables associated with alterations in PAD plaque morphology. Thirty-one patients underwent intravascular ultrasonography (IVUS) at the time of arteriography for symptomatic PAD. IVUS data were analyzed with radiofrequency techniques for quantification of plaque composition, plaque volume, and total vessel volume. Associations between plaque characteristics and clinical variables were evaluated. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed using t-test, Pearson correlations, F-tests, and analysis of variance. Calcium (Ca2+) channel blocker use was associated with a smaller total atherosclerotic plaque burden (44.2 +/- 2.7 vs 52.9 +/- 2.5%; p < .05), and decreased fibrous plaque content (18.2 +/- 1.8% vs 24.0 +/- 1.9%; p < .05). Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor use, however, was associated with a larger total atherosclerotic plaque burden (58.3 +/- 2.2% vs 42.9 +/- 2.1%; p < .01) and larger fibrous plaque content (27.2 +/- 2.0% vs 17.7 +/- 1.6%; p < .001). Multivariable analysis was performed to evaluate which factors may differentially impact the response variable measurements of plaque volume to vessel volume. Based on this model, those without the use of an antihyperlipidemic agent or ACE inhibitor had an average total atherosclerotic plaque burden of 47.7%. Those on an antihyperlipidemic agent had an average decrease of 7.0% (p < .05), whereas those on ACE inhibitors had an average increase of 16.2% from the baseline value (p < .001). The use of calcium channel blockers is associated with significantly decreased atherosclerotic plaque burden and decreased fibrous plaque content, whereas the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with an increase in plaque burden and an increased fibrous plaque content. The use of these medications in PAD may alter plaque morphology with the potential to affect clinical outcomes.", 
    "465": "Binding of a panel of eight monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with the C domain of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) to human testicular ACE (tACE) (corresponding to the C domain of the somatic enzyme) was studied and the inhibition of the enzyme by the mAb 4E3 was found. The dissociation constants of complexes of two mAbs, IB8 and 2H9, with tACE were 2.3 +/- 0.4 and 2.5 +/- 0.4 nM, respectively, for recombinant tACE and 1.6 +/- 0.3 nM for spermatozoid tACE. Competition parameters of mAb binding with tACE were obtained and analyzed. As a result, the eight mAbs were divided into three groups, whose binding epitopes did not overlap: (1) 1E10, 2B11, 2H9, 3F11, and 4E3; (2) 1B8 and 3F10; and (3) IB3. A diagram demonstrating mAb competitive binding with tACE was proposed. Comparative analysis of mAb binding to human and chimpanzee ACE was carried out, which resulted in revealing of two amino acid residues, Lys677 and Pro730, responsible for binding of three antibodies, 1E10, 1B8, and 3F10. It was found by mutation of Asp616 located close to Lys677 that the mAb binding epitope 1E10 contains Asp616 and Lys677, whereas mAbs 1B8 and 3F10 contain Pro730.",

The Management of Anemia in French Kidney Transplant Patients (MATRIX) study is an observational study conducted in 10 academic hospitals among kidney-transplant patients designed to evaluate the prevalence, associated factors and management of post-transplant anemia. Over two consecutive weeks, 418 recipients (males: 248; age: 50.8+/-12.7 years) were included, all were transplanted for more than six months. Mean serum creatinine (Scr) was 152+/-67 micromol/l and mean hemoglobin (Hb) was 12.4+/-1.8 g/dl (males: 12.8+/-1.9 g/dl; females 11.9+/-1.6 g/dl). Irrespective of the delay following transplantation, 23% of patients (n=95) were severely anemic (Hb < or = 11 g/dl). Eighteen percent of the patients received an antianemic treatment (10% oral iron, 7% erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESA), 4% folic acid) and only 35% of the severely anemic patients were actually treated (n=33). A significantly-negative correlation was observed between eGFR and Hb levels (R= -0.347, p<0.02). Ninety-six percent of the 193 patients transplanted for more than six months and a Scr greater than 150 micromol/l (n=185) suffered at least one comorbidity (89% hypertension, 32% hypercholesterolemia, 13% diabetes); this group represent the second cohort. Seventy-four percent of them were treated with mycophenolate mofetil, 16% with azathioprine, and 62% with an ACEI or angiotensin II receptor antagonists. Since the transplantation, 127 patients (66%) have been anemic (Hb < or = 11 g/dl) and 58% (n=112) were treated (iron and/or ESA, respectively 81 and 55%). Among the patients not treated for anemia, 74% had an Hb level below 12g/dl. ESA-treated patients received a mean dose of 8500 UI+/-2800 per week. Anemia is under-diagnosed and under-treated in renal-transplant recipients, despite its high prevalence. As expected, a correlation between renal function and Hb levels was observed, as in CKD patients.

The RAS is activated and renal interstitial hydrostatic pressure (RIHP) is decreased in diabetic rats. The objective of this study was to evaluate the roles of proximal tubule reabsorption and RAS in the decreased RIHP and blunted natriuretic and diuretic responses to acute saline volume expansion (VE) in diabetic rats. Enalapril was utilized to inhibit angiotensin II (AII) formation. Diabetes mellitus (DM) was induced by a single intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of streptozotocin (STZ, 65 mg/kg). RIHP was measured by a polyethylene (PE) matrix that was chronically implanted in the left kidney. Fractional excretion of phosphate (FE(Pi)) and fractional excretion of lithium (FE(Li)) were used as indexes for proximal tubule reabsorption. VE significantly increased both FE(Li) and FE(Pi) in all groups of rats studied. However, the increase in FE(Li) (DeltaFE(Li)=17.26+/-3.83%) and FE(Pi) (DeltaFE(Pi)=7.38+/-2.37%) in diabetic rats (DC, n=12) were significantly lower as compared with those in nondiabetic control rats (NC, n=8; DeltaFE(Li)=32.15+/-4.71% and DeltaFE(Pi)=20.62+/-3.27%). The blunted increases in FE(Li) and FE(Pi) were associated with an attenuated increase in RIHP (DeltaRIHP) in DC (1.8+/-0.4 mm Hg) compared with NC rats (4.3+/-0.3 mm Hg). Enalapril treatment (25 mg/kg/day in drinking water) had no effect on nondiabetic rats (NE, n=8) as compared with untreated NC rats, but significantly improved RIHP response (DeltaRIHP) to VE in diabetic rats (DE, n=9; 2.8+/-0.5 mm Hg). Both DeltaFE(Li) and DeltaFE(Pi) were restored by enalapril treatment in diabetic rats and no significant differences were found in DeltaFE(Li) and DeltaFE(Pi) between DE (DeltaFE(Li)=26.81+/-4.94% and DeltaFE(Pi)=10.45+/-4.67%) and NC groups of rats in response to VE.

The natural history of ARAS is characterized by anatomic disease progression and/or renal dysfunction in only a minority of patients. Medical therapy for ARAS is directed primarily toward blood pressure control and cardiovascular risk factor reduction. Renal artery revascularization is an additional treatment option for ARAS associated with ischemic nephropathy or severe, poorly controlled hypertension despite aggressive medical therapy. Unfortunately, the benefits associated with revascularization versus medical therapy alone remain unproven. Renal artery revascularization may be accomplished through open surgical revascularization or angioplasty and stenting. Although surgical renal revascularization is associated with more durable results and relatively lower risk for postoperative renal function decline, the increased risk of death or major complications associated with this management approach limit its use in patients with significant comorbidities. Renal artery angioplasty and stenting is being utilized with increasing frequency but is of uncertain benefit and is associated with rates of post-intervention renal function improvement and deterioration that are approximately equal. Renal function outcomes associated with angioplasty and stenting may be improved through a selective treatment approach and utilization of distal embolic protection. Renal artery revascularization represents the only treatment alternative for patients unresponsive to medical management, and is therefore the ''treatment of choice'' in this select group. Results of ongoing randomized trials are eagerly anticipated and may provide useful guidance for future management of ARAS.",

Prorenin/renin binding to the prorenin/renin receptor [(p)RR] enhances the efficiency of angiotensinogen cleavage by renin and unmasks prorenin catalytic activity. We asked whether plasma prorenin could be activated in local vascular tissue through receptor binding. Immunohistochemical staining showing localization of the (p)RR in the aorta to vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). After cultured rat VSMCs were incubated with 10(-7) M inactive prorenin, cultured supernatant acquired the ability to generate ANG I from angiotensinogen, indicating that prorenin had been activated. Activated prorenin facilitated angiotensin generation in cultured VSMCs when exogenous angiotensinogen was added. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) against the (p)RR blocked this activation and subsequent angiotensin generation. Prorenin alone induced dose- and time-dependent increases in mRNA and protein for the profibrotic molecule plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1, effects that were blocked by siRNA, but not by the ANG II receptor antagonist saralasin. When inactive prorenin and angiotensinogen were incubated with cells, PAI-1 mRNA increased a striking 54-fold, 8-fold higher than the increase seen with prorenin alone. PAI-1 protein increased 2.75-fold. These effects were blocked by treatment with siRNA + saralasin. We conclude that prorenin at high concentration binds the (p)RR on VSMCs and is activated. This activation leads to increased expression of PAI-1 via ANG II-independent and -dependent mechanisms. These data provide a mechanism by which elevated prorenin levels in diabetes may contribute to the progression of fibrotic disease.", 
    "497": "The results of the 'Ongoing telmisartan alone and in combination with ramipril global eendpoint trial' (ONTARGET) have recently been published. In this trial, which was performed in patients with a high cardiovascular risk, it was investigated whether angiotensin II receptor blockade with telmisartan is equally effective as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition with ramipril and whether the combination oftelmisartan and ramipril (dual blockade) is more effective than ACE-inhibition alone to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and hospitalization for heart failure. On the basis of the ONTARGET results it can be concluded that dual blockade has no place in the treatment of high cardiovascular risk patients without heart failure, because this approach gives no additional reduction of cardiovascular risk and may even be associated with increased mortality. It also has more side effects. Since telmisartan was equally effective and safe as ramipril, one can choose from both agents in the treatment of patients with a high cardiovascular risk.", 
    "498": "By the time the clinical findings of atherosclerotic disease appear, involvement is usually at an advanced stage and procedures after this stage are usually palliative or aimed at secondary protection. On the other hand, prevention can be achieved by the detection and treatment of endothelial dysfunction, which is one of the most important changes in the early subclinical stage of atherosclerotic disease. When the systemic involvement of endothelial dysfunction is taken into consideration, checking from the peripheral arteries with noninvasive methods gives one-to-one correct information. Currently, endothelial dysfunction can be detected using simple, inexpensive, and noninterventional methods. Particularly, easily accessible localization of the brachial artery is ideal for the evaluation of endothelial dysfunction. Flow-mediated dilation method (FMD; endothelial-dependent vasodilation), which can be carried out noninvasively with ultrasonography on the brachial artery, is a frequently used method for the assessment of endothelial dysfunction. A sphygmomanometer is placed on the forearm to create a flow stimulation in the brachial artery. The sphygmomanometer is inflated until the systolic pressure is above 50 mm Hg, thus stopping the antegrade blood flow and creating ischemia. Consequently, vasodilation occurs at the resistance arteries distal to where the flow is blocked. When the sphygmomanometer is deflated, a reactive hyperemia occurs in the brachial artery. The % difference between the diameter measured after reactive hyperemia and the basal diameter is taken as FMD. The effects of the treatments on endothelial dysfunction can be monitored with this method. Studies have shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin 1 (AT1) receptor blockers, latest-generation beta blockers such as nebivolol and carvediol, statins, estrogen treatment, diet, and exercise increase FMD. Before this method becomes a part of routine clinical evaluation of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, measurement technique and FMD values need to be standardized.",

Despite these findings, the therapeutic management of HF-PSF is not clearly defined. We will discuss in this review of the literature the current therapeutic management of HF-PSF, including the role of precipitating factors such as hypertension, myocardial ischaemia and supraventricular arrhythmias, and the main results of epidemiological registries and randomized controlled clinical trials in this disease. Only four large therapeutic trials have assessed the impact of different classes of drugs (digoxin, angiotensin II converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptors type I blockers and beta-blockers) on morbidity and mortality in HF-PSF. Results of these trials are disappointing. Apart from the beta-blockers, the other three classes of drugs did not show benefit on the outcome of the disease. Moreover, the results of the beta-blocker trial are controversial as a mixed population of heart failure with and without preserved systolic function was studied. Finally, the current therapeutic management of patients with HF-PSF is still based on our pathophysiological knowledge: education, low salt diet, diuretics, slowing heart rate and controlling triggering factors. Other large randomized controlled multicenter trials, which may help us in the understanding of HF-PSP and its therapeutic management, are ongoing.",

A phylogenetic tree constructed with actin sequences of both vertebrate and invertebrate species indicated a high homology. Furthermore, a quantitative in silico ACE inhibition analysis suggested that actin proteins of invertebrates have potentials as new sources of ACE inhibitory peptides. On one insect, Bombyx mori, a more detailed in silico analysis was done followed by a small experimental study. The in silico analysis indicated B. mori as a high-potential source of ACE inhibitory peptides and this was supported by the ACE inhibitory activity of the partially purified actin preparation. In conclusion, in food science, in silico analysis can be used as fast initial screening tool to look for high-potential sources of ACE inhibitory peptides and other peptidic bioactivities.",

TGF-beta is a key cytokine that both initiates and terminates tissue repair, and its sustained production underlies the development of tissue fibrosis, particularly after MI. We investigated the effects of a novel orally active specific inhibitor of the TGF-beta receptor 1 (SD-208) in an experimental model of MI. Mice underwent ligation of the left coronary artery to induce MI and were subsequently treated for 30 d after infarction with either SD-208 or a vehicle control. Blockade of TGF-beta signaling reduced mean arterial pressure in all groups. SD-208 treatment after MI resulted in a trend for reduced ventricular and renal gene expression of TGF-beta-activated kinase-1 (a downstream modulator of TGF-beta signaling) and a significant decrease in collagen 1, in association with a marked decrease in cardiac mass. Post-MI SD-208 treatment significantly reduced circulating levels of plasma renin activity as well as down-regulating the components of the cardiac and renal renin-angiotensin system (angiotensinogen, angiotensin converting enzyme, and angiotensin II type I receptor).

Although the research supporting this data may still be considered uncertain about the efficacy of a low protein diet on slowing the progression of CKD, it may also be considered safe since it is the RDA (Levey et al., 2006). Other interventions may include control of proteinuria, of high blood pressure, and blood sugar, and the use of an ACE inhibitor or ARB. In CKD Stages 3 and 4, there are more enthusiastic recommendations regarding protein, potassium, and phosphorous that influence diet decision making but are not necessarily employed in the earlier stages of CKD. In addition, we cannot neglect that these patients, despite our best efforts, often progress to Stage 5 CKD treated with peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis. We must maintain an optimum nutritional status along the continuum of CKD Stages 1 to 5. Protein energy malnutrition is a predictor of morbidity and mortality in patients on dialysis (NKF, 2000). The goal for these patients is to be well nourished and kidney protected, which is a balancing act. Medicare supports medical nutrition therapy for registered dietitian (RD) services for patients with GFRs of 15 to 50 mL/min/1.73m2 (NKF, 2007). The RDs in nephrology are effective in reviewing the diet options and providing necessary guidance and support to individuals with CKD. These RDs are the nutrition information resource for practitioners treating patients with Stages 1 to 4 CKD.", 
    "555": "Left ventricular remodeling is a key determinant of the clinical course and outcome of systolic heart failure. The myocardial renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been closely linked to the major maladaptive cellular and molecular changes that accompany left ventricular remodeling. Direct inhibition of various components of the RAS, such as the angiotensin-converting enzyme, angiotensin II type 1 receptor, and aldosterone, has resulted in favorable clinical responses in heart failure. Many questions, however, remain unanswered regarding the timing of initiation, optimum doses, need for simultaneous use of RAS inhibitors, and proper monitoring of RAS blockade. Additionally, significant variation has been noted in individual responses to RAS blockade as a result of genetic differences. Answering these questions requires direct access to the myocardial component of RAS, which is largely independent of its systemic component. Molecular imaging using radiotracers with high affinities for myocardial angiotensin-converting enzyme and angiotensin II type 1 receptors can provide direct access to tissue RAS and thus provide a better understanding of the pathophysiology of left ventricular remodeling in individual patients. This Article briefly reviews the potential for evaluating the tissue expression of angiotensin in heart failure by targeted RAS imaging.",

Proteinuria is also a strong predictor of cardiovascular events. Convincing preclinical and clinical evidence exists that proteinuria and the underlying glomerulosclerosis are reversible processes. This Review outlines the mechanisms involved in the development of glomerulosclerosis--particularly those responsible for podocyte injury--with an emphasis on the potential capacity of endothelin receptor blockade to reverse this process. There is strong evidence that endothelin-1, a peptide with growth-promoting and vasoconstricting properties, has a central role in the pathogenesis of proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis, which is mediated via activation of the ET(A) receptor. Several antiproteinuric drugs, including angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor antagonists, statins and certain calcium channel blockers, inhibit the formation of endothelin-1. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that endothelin receptor antagonists can reverse proteinuric renal disease and glomerulosclerosis, and preliminary studies in humans with renal disease have shown that these drugs have remarkable antiproteinuric effects that are additive to those of standard antiproteinuric therapy. Additional clinical studies are needed.",

The investigators found that patients with type 2 diabetes and proteinuria who have the D allele have an unfavorable renal prognosis, which is improved by losartan treatment (vs placebo) when given together with conventional antihypertensive treatment. No significant improvement in outcomes was observed in losartan-treated patients with the II genotype. Previous observational studies had suggested a decreased beneficial effect of ACE inhibitors in patients with type 1 diabetic nephropathy who have the DD genotype. Prospective studies in this area are needed before I/D genotype characterization can be used to guide the choice of therapy in patients with diabetes and proteinuria.",

The pharmaceutical preparations containing hydrochlorothiazide and one of the angiotensin convertase inhibitors were investigated. It was found that the developed method enables the constituents of the investigated drugs to be determined directly despite evident interference of the zero order absorption spectra. For determination of enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide as well as candesartan and hydrochlorothiazide the first derivative was used, while for walsartan and hydrochlorothiazide the second derivative was employed. The method was of high sensitivity; the LOD accuracy for enalapril was 2.81 microg x mL(-1), 0.56 microg x mL(-1) for candesartan, 4.02 microg x mL(-1) for walsartan and ranged from 0.31 microg x mL(-1) to 1.78 microgxmL(-1) for hydrochlorothiazide, depending on preparation under investigation. The recovery of individual constituents was within the limit of 100% +/- 5%, RSD varied from 1.11% to 2.94%, and the linearity range was from 4.1 microg x mL(-1) to 20.5 microg x mL(-1) for enalapril, from 6.45 microg x mL(-1) to 32.25 microg x mL(-1) for walsartan, from 2.36 microg x mL(-1) to 11.80 microg x mL(-1) for candesartan, and from 0.96 microg x mL(-1) to 26.00 microg x mL(-1) for hydrochlorothiazide.", 
    "565": "Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE), a key enzyme in cardiovascular pathophysiology, consists of 2 homologous domains, each bearing a Zn-dependent active site. The ratio of the rates of hydrolysis of 2 synthetic substrates, Z-Phe-His-Leu (ZPHL) and Hip-His-Leu (HHL), is characteristic for each type of ACE: somatic 2-domain 1, N-domain 4.5, and C-domain 0.7 (Williams et al, 1996). We hypothesized that inactivation or selective inhibition of the C-domain within the somatic ACE should increase the ratio from 1 toward higher values, whereas inactivation or inhibition of the N-domain should decrease the ratio to lower values. Temperatures in the 40-60 degrees C range cause preferential inactivation of the C-domain in somatic ACE and an increase in the ZPHL/HHL ratio. Determination of the ZPHL/HHL ratio in freshly 100-fold concentrated urine ruled out the existence of the N-domain fragment in human urine, which appears only as a result of long storage. Inhibition of ACE by common inhibitors also increases the ZPHL/HHL ratio for 2-domain ACE, thus providing a sensitive method for the detection of ACE inhibitors in biological fluids. Therefore, simultaneous measurements of ACE activity with 2 substrates (ZPHL and HHL) and calculation of their ratio allow us to monitor the status of the ACE molecule and detect ACE inhibitors (endogenous and exogenous) in human blood and other biological fluids. This method should find wide application in monitoring clinical trials with ACE inhibitors and in the development of the approach for personalized medicine by these effective drugs.",

In high-risk patients with coronary heart disease (CHD), treatment with these agents reduces the mortality rate and improves secondary outcomes. Individuals with stable CHD who are at lower risk benefit less from treatment. RAS inhibition also provides some clinical benefit to patients with diastolic HF and preserved left ventricular function. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a strong predictor of cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality in patients with hypertension. Treatment with an ARB reduces the risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with hypertension and LVH. The benefits correlate with regression of LVH, and the effect is independent of the degree of blood pressure lowering. Finally, studies indicate that a history of hypertension in patients who have not had a myocardial infarction (MI) increases the risk for HF after MI; the risk is decreased in patients with hypertension who receive treatment with a RAS inhibitor.",

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diabetes mellitus are prevalent causes of cardiovascular disease owing to associations with major cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension, and they are substantial health burdens. Even mild-to-moderate CKD and prehypertension increase cardiovascular risk. First-line agents for reducing cardiovascular risk are inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system: angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). In clinical trials, treatment of high-risk patients with ACE inhibitors and ARBs delays or prevents the onset of diabetes and prevents progression of renal disease and cardiovascular events, including cardiovascular mortality. Current evidence indicates that the clinical efficacy of these end points includes effects that may be beyond blood pressure reduction.",

The pharmacodynamic effects were assessed by measuring plasma angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity. Maximum ramipril concentrations were attained within 30 min following a single dose and declined rapidly (concentrations were below the limit of quantification 4 h after treatment). Peak ramiprilat concentrations were detected at approximately 1.5 h. The apparent terminal half-life (t((1/2)beta)) was > or =20 h irrespective of the dose. Ramiprilat accumulated in plasma (ratio of accumulation 1.3 to 1.9 depending on the dose rate) following repeated administration. Steady-state conditions were attained after the second dose. Excretion was predominant in faeces (87%) and to a lesser extent in urine (11%). The rate and extent of absorption of ramipril as well as its conversion to ramiprilat were not significantly influenced by the presence of food in the gastrointestinal tract. Plasma-ACE activity was almost completely abolished 0.5-2.0 h after treatment, irrespective of the dose rate. Significant inhibition of ACE activity of 54.7 to 82.6% (depending on the dosage) was still present 24 h after treatment. Treatment was well-tolerated in all cats. Ramipril at a dose rate of 0.125 mg/kg once daily produces significant and long-lasting inhibition of ACE activity in healthy cats. The appropriateness of this dosage regime needs to be confirmed in diseased cats.",

Serum adiponectin, HbA1c levels, lipid profiles and blood pressure were recorded at the beginning and 3 months later. In vitro, differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with telmisartan, candesartan, pioglitazone or vehicle for 24 h, and then adiponectin mRNA and protein levels were measured. The results showed that most of the metabolic parameters, including the lipid profiles, did not change significantly during the study in either group. However, the changes in serum adiponectin and plasma glucose over 3 months were significantly greater in the telmisartan group than in the candesartan group. In vitro, although the protein level of adiponectin was not significantly elevated, the mRNA expression of adiponectin was elevated 1.5-fold by telmisartan in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.

These include modulation of angiogenesis, cellular proliferation, immune responses and extracellular matrix formation. Knowledge of the RAS has increased dramatically in recent years with the discovery of new enzymes, peptides and feedback mechanisms. The local RAS appears to influence tumour growth and metastases and there is evidence of tissue- and tumour-specific differences.

There were no available trials of dual- versus single-agent therapy after failure of a thiazide diuretic.

However, to minimise the risk of adverse effects, it is clearly better to select single-agent therapy with a drug that has been shown to prevent cardiovascular events in first-line treatment of otherwise healthy hypertensive patients. Possible options include: angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II antagonists, calcium channel blockers or betablockers. In patients over the age of 60, betablockers seem less effective that the other drugs in preventing strokes.

The Chronic Heart Failure Analysis and Registry in the Tohoku District (CHART)-1 study was one of the largest cohorts in Japan. The study has clarified the characteristics and prognosis of Japanese patients with CHF, demonstrating that their prognosis was similarly poor compared with those in Western countries. However, we still need evidence for the prevention and treatment of CHF based on the large cohort studies or randomized treatment trials in the Japanese population. Since the strategy for CHF management is now changing from treatment to prevention, a larger-size prospective cohort, called the CHART-2 study, has been initiated to evaluate the risk factors of CHF in Japan.

    "600": "The endothelium is characterized by a wide range of important homeostatic functions. It participates in the control of hemostasis, blood coagulation and fibrinolysis, platelet and leukocyte interactions with the vessel wall, regulation of vascular tone, and of blood pressure. Many crucial vasoactive endogenous compounds are produced by the endothelial cells to control the functions of vascular smooth muscle cells and of circulating blood cells. These complex systems determine a fine equilibrium which regulates the vascular tone. Impairments in endothelium-dependent vasodilation lead to the so called endothelial dysfunction. Endothelial dysfunction is then characterized by unbalanced concentrations of vasodilating and vasoconstricting factors, the most important being represented by nitric oxide (NO) and angiotensin II (AT II). High angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity leads to increased AT II generation, reduced NO levels with subsequent vasoconstriction. The net acute effect results in contraction of vascular smooth muscle cells and reduced lumen diameter. Furthermore, when increased ACE activity is chronically sustained, increase in growth, proliferation and differentiation of the vascular smooth muscle cells takes place; at the same time, a decrease in the anti-proliferative action by NO, a decrease in fibinolysis and an increase in platelets aggregation may be observed. AT II is then involved not only in the regulation of blood pressure, but also in vascular inflammation, permeability, smooth muscle cells remodelling, and oxidative stress which in turn lead to atherosclerosis and increased cardiovascular risk. Given the pivotal role exerted by AT II in contributing to alteration of endothelial function, treatment with ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may be of particular interest to restore a physiological activity of endothelial cells. In this view, the blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), has been shown to positively affect the endothelial function, beyond the antihypertensive action displayed by these compounds. In this review, attention has been specifically focused on an ARB, irbesartan, to examine its effects on endothelial function.", 
    "601": "We report a case of obvious pseudoaldosteronism which occurred after the additional administration of cilostazol against arteriosclerosis obliterans (ASO) for bilateral legs in a 65 year-old man patient who had safely received glycyrrhizin for the previous ten years. Serum potassium level of the patient had been kept above 4 mEq/L until initiating cilostazol in November, 2006, then gradually decreased to 2.5 mEq/L for the following seven months. Both plasma renin activity and aldosterone were suppressed under co-administration of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, imidapril and the angiotensin II receptor blocker, olmesartan, both of which had been prescribed for longer than a year. Urinary potassium excretion was accelerated even in the critical level of hypokalemia. Because other drugs and supplements had not been changed at least for a year, pseudoaldosteronism caused by the combination of glycyrrhizin and another triggering factor, possibly cilostazol was highly suspected. By discontinuation of glycyrrhizin, potassium supplement, and the additional administration of the aldosterone blocker, spironolactone, the serum potassium level returned to the normal level two weeks later, even though cilostazol had been continued to avoid progression in his ASO. This is the first report of a case exhibiting pseudoaldosteronism induced by the interaction of glycyrrhizin with cilostazol, not by glycyrrhizin alone.", 
    "602": "Bradykinin (BK) coronary outflow and left ventricular (LV) performance of kininogen-deficient Brown Norway Katholiek (BNK) rats and Brown Norway Hannover (BNH) controls were investigated. We analyzed whether the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor ramipril is able to attenuate LV dysfunction after induction of myocardial infarction (MI) in this animal model. Ex vivo, the basal BK content in the coronary outflow of buffer-perfused, isolated hearts was measured by specific radioimmunoassay. In vivo, left ventricular pressure (LVP), the maximal rate of LVP increase, LV end-diastolic pressure, the maximal rate of LVP decrease and heart rate were determined using a tip catheter 3 weeks after induction of MI. Compared to BNK rats, basal BK outflow was increased 30-fold in controls (p<0.01). In vivo, we found no significant differences between sham-ligated BNK and BNH rats in basal LV function. After MI, the impairment of LV function was significantly worse in BNK rats when compared to BNH rats. ACE inhibition significantly attenuated this LV dysfunction in both groups, when compared to untreated animals. Reduced basal BK level resulting from kininogen deficiency has no effect on basal LV function, but remains to be a risk factor for the ischemic heart. However, ACE inhibition is sufficient to improve LV function despite kininogen deficiency.", 
    "603": "This article aimed at investigating the synthesis of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory peptides and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) during sourdough fermentation of white wheat, wholemeal wheat, and rye flours. Sourdough lactic acid bacteria, selected previously for proteinase and peptidase activities toward wheat proteins or for the capacity of synthesizing GABA, were used. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity was found by fermenting flour under semiliquid conditions (dough yield 330) and, especially, by using wholemeal wheat flour. Fourteen peptides, not previously reported as ACE-inhibitory, were identified from the water/salt-soluble extract of wholemeal wheat sourdough (IC 50 0.19-0.54 mg/mL). The major part of the identified peptides contained the well-known antihypertensive epitope VAP. The synthesis of GABA increased when the dough yield was decreased to 160. The highest synthesis of GABA (258.71 mg/kg) was found in wholemeal wheat sourdough.", 
    "604": "Renal pathophysiology is elicited by activation of angiotensin II type 1 (AT(1)) receptors at all stages of renovascular disease. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) that specifically block the AT(1) receptor offer the potential to prevent or delay progression to end-stage renal disease independently of reductions in blood pressure. Proteinuria--an early and sensitive marker for progressive renal dysfunction--is reduced by ARB use in patients with type 2 diabetic nephropathy and microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria. Retrospective analysis of data available from early trials has confirmed this finding and has shown that albuminuria reduction is associated with lessening of cardiovascular risk. The ARB telmisartan is equivalent to enalapril in preventing glomerular filtration rate decline, and equivalent to valsartan in reducing proteinuria. Telmisartan is more effective than conventional therapy in lowering the risk of transition to overt nephropathy in hypertensive and normotensive patients. An additive effect has been seen in smaller studies when telmisartan has been added to lisinopril therapy, and high-dose telmisartan reduces albuminuria better than low-dose telmisartan. Similar data were obtained with other ARBs such as candesartan, losartan, valsartan, or irbesartan. These data support the proposition that blockade of the renin-angiotensin system beyond that required for maximum blood pressure reduction provides optimum renal protection.", 
    "605": "Cardiovascular risk profiling and therapy have traditionally been based on established risk factors, such as age, smoking, sex, hypertension, dyslipidemia, body weight, and diabetes mellitus. Despite optimum therapy, cardiovascular mortality and morbidity remain high. Attention is being devoted, therefore, to identifying new risk factors that can also be used as therapeutic targets. Renal dysfunction manifesting as low glomerular filtration rate, albuminuria, or anemia is a strong risk factor for cardiovascular disease and is prevalent in the general population and among patients with cardiovascular disease. Epidemiological data suggest that 10-11% of the general population have low glomerular filtration rates, 5-7% have increased urinary albumin excretion, and 5-10% have anemia. Each of these features represents an independent but additive cardiovascular risk. Treatments for all these indications can reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity as well as renal risk. Such findings suggest that treatment should be directed towards improving renal function in order to achieve optimum cardiovascular benefit. Such a strategy would offer the possibility of multiorgan therapy in diseases characterized by multiorgan impairment, such as type 2 diabetes. I present the evidence that renal dysfunction is a common and powerful cardiovascular risk factor and that treatment strategies intervening in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system can be used to target albuminuria and reduce cardiovascular and renal risk.",

Drugs classified as non-cardiological were received by 36.2% of patients. The optimal pharmacotherapy including four medications, one from each therapeutic class used in order to improve the prognosis of the patient (an antiplatelet drug, a beta-blocker, an ACE-I, statin), was received by a total of 45.8% of the participants, three medications by 31.7%, two medications by 15.8%, and one medication by 5.5%; 1.2% of the participants did not receive any medication from the four groups of drugs improving prognosis. What is worth noting, however, is the use of relatively small doses of ACE-I and beta-blockers. 69.9% of patients also received at least one symptomatic drug (a long-acting nitrate, a calcium channel blocker, a metabolic drug, molsidomine), including 39.7% - 1 drug, 22.7% - 2 drugs, 6.7% - 3 drugs, and 0.8% - 4 drugs from the classes mentioned above.",

Currently, the majority of patients receive drugs that improve prognosis. The awareness of the benefits of the use of combined treatment with all the drug groups and their appropriate doses should be higher. The significant percentage of patients with persisting symptoms of angina pectoris indicates the necessity to improve the efficacy of intervention also in this respect.",

Percutaneous needle biopsy was consistent with diffuse endocapillary proliferative glomerulonephritis and initially managed conservatively with injection methyl prednisolone, cyclophosphamide, lisinopril etc. without any improvement. Living-related renal transplantation was done successfully from paternal uncle. Two episodes of acute rejection occurred, one immediately after transplantation and another after one month. These were managed with IV methyl prednisolone for 3 days. At present, he is on oral prednisolone, cyclosporine, azathioprine and antihypertensives with normal haemoglobin and stable serum creatinine level (pre-transplant level 12.5mg/dl to post-transplant level 1.5mg/dl). He has been maintaining his normal life including schooling for last few months. It is concluded that a patient with uncommon presentation of nephrotic syndrome should be confirmed by renal biopsy and renal transplantation may be considered if conservative measures fail.",

This prospective, multicentre, cohort study investigates the efficacy and safety of this regimen over 24 weeks in 213 Chinese patients with active lupus nephritis (Classes III, IV, V or combination). Baseline activity index (AI) was 6.91+/-3.33 and chronicity index (CI) was 1.9+/-1.2. The remission rate was 82.6% at 24 weeks (complete remission, 34.3%; partial remission, 48.4%). There were significant (P<0.01) improvements in kidney function shown by reductions in proteinuria, serum albumin, serum creatinine and creatinine clearance, as well as in systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity index (SLEDAI) scores. Independent risk factors influencing remission were pathological classification (including Class V and III or Class V and IV nephritis) and elevated serum creatinine at baseline (OR 2.967, 95% CI: 1.479-6.332, P=0.001 and OR 1.007, 95% CI: 1.002-1.011, P=0.001, respectively). Patients with concomitant membranous features on biopsy had a lower remission rate than those with Class III and IV nephritis (66.7% vs 87.3%, P=0.002). Renal biopsy was repeated in 25 patients following treatment. There was a transition to less severe pathological morphologies in majority of subjects. Infections were monitored throughout treatment: eight patients (3.8%) experienced bacterial infections, whereas herpes zoster occurred in seven patients. Nine patients (4.2%) suffered from gastrointestinal upset, which resolved without discontinuation of MMF. One patient became leucopenic, whereas another died from active disease unrelated to kidney symptoms.

    "614": "The US Food and Drug Administration's approval in March 2007 of aliskiren, the first commercially available direct renin inhibitor, for the treatment of hypertension met with great enthusiasm. Clinical trials have demonstrated it to be as effective as other commonly prescribed antihypertensive agents with few side effects. Preclinical studies in genetically manipulated rats have shown it to be effective in reversing angiotensin II-induced cardiac and renal damage. Despite the notable absence of human clinical data for this agent, many clinicians have touted aliskiren as the ideal agent to achieve additional suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) as a means to reduce the morbidity and mortality of chronic diseases of the cardiovascular and renal systems. Clinical studies are ongoing and future studies are planned to prove its effectiveness in several chronic diseases known to be related to RAAS activation.", 
    "615": "The Heart Outcomes Prevention (HOPE) trial was the first to demonstrate the benefits of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor ramipril for high-risk cardiovascular patients. Whether the cardioprotective effects seen in HOPE and other trials are specific to distinct ACE inhibitors remains controversial. Evidence of a lack of class effect for ACE inhibitors has policy and financial implications related to reference pricing by insurers and inclusion on pharmacy formularies. Because head-to-head trials comparing the different ACE inhibitors are unforeseen, clinicians and administrators must rely on secondary-level data and observational studies. Only a handful of studies have sought to address the dispute over a class effect among ACE inhibitors, which is reviewed in this article.", 
    "616": "The issue of race in medicine is problematic. Race is not a physiologic grouping, and all persons of a given race do not necessarily share the same clinical phenotype or genetic substrate. Despite clear signals that certain risk factors and diseases vary as a function of race, translating those differences into race-based therapeutics has been awkward and has done little to change the natural history of cardiovascular disease as it affects special populations. Among the varied special populations, the African American population appears to have the most significant and adverse variances for cardiovascular disease as well as worrisome signals that drug responsiveness varies. Recent guideline statements have now acknowledged certain treatment options that are most appropriate for African Americans with cardiovascular disease, especially hypertension and heart failure. As more physiologic markers of disease and drug responsiveness become available, the need for racial designations in medicine may lessen, and therapies can be optimized for all patients without regard to race or ethnicity.", 
    "617": "Elevated levels of angiotensin II result in oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction, which initiate atherogenic pathologic processes that are important in cardiovascular disease development. Angiotensin II induces its deleterious effects primarily through the type 1 receptor; these effects are inhibited by angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) directly at the receptor level. Angiotensin II may potentiate protective mechanisms through stimulation of the type 2 receptor, which is not blocked by ARBs. Accumulating data suggest that blockade of angiotensin II production or activity provides vascular and cardioprotective benefits, such as reduction of atrial fibrillation, acute myocardial infarction, and heart failure events. Moreover, blockade of the renin-angiotensin system has been shown to offer renal protection in subjects with and without diabetes mellitus and to reduce the risk of new-onset diabetes.", 
    "618": "Hypertension and hyperlipidemia are interrelated and share common pathophysiologic mechanisms, such as insulin resistance and endothelial dysfunction. Accumulating evidence shows that it is important to regulate hypertension and hyperlipidemia to reduce cardiovascular risk. However, medications such as beta-blockers and thiazide diuretics, which are widely used for blood pressure regulation, are known to have several metabolic side effects. Despite deleterious effects on glucose metabolism and lipid metabolism, these medications have been proven to reduce cardiovascular risk. On the other hand, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and alpha-blockers have either no effect or favorable effects on the lipid profile. This review outlines the need to control hypertension, options for several antihypertensive medications, their differing effects on lipid metabolism, and the clinical implications of their effects on lipid parameters.", 
    "619": "Hypertension commonly clusters with other cardiovascular risk factors, giving rise to the concept that hypertension is a multifaceted disease that potentially shares common pathogenic pathways with other risk factors. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system has a central role in the shared mechanisms of hypertension and cardiovascular disease, primarily through angiotensin II. Increased levels of angiotensin II disrupt the balance of vasoactive substances and growth factors that regulate endothelial structure and function, and inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker helps restore this equilibrium. Some pathogenic mechanisms may also be favorably affected by calcium channel blockade. While the relative contribution of pleiotropic effects to clinical benefit is difficult to quantify, based on recent data it is reasonable to consider using newer antihypertensive agents in selected high-risk patients to realize the benefits that may derive from interfering with pathogenic mechanisms of disease.",

In addition, eight spontaneously hypertensive rats were treated for 8 weeks with the angiotensin receptor blocker olmesartan, and eight spontaneously hypertensive rats with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril. The heart and a skeletal muscle (quadriceps femoris) were promptly dissected and frozen. Insulin signaling was evaluated by Western blot analysis of involved proteins; in addition, microvessel density was indirectly evaluated by immunohistochemistry.", 
    "626": "Blood pressure values were normalized by both olmesartan and enalapril. In the heart, no statistically significant difference in the expression of proteins involved in insulin signaling was observed between untreated spontaneously hypertensive rats and Wistar-Kyoto controls. On the contrary, in the skeletal muscle of untreated spontaneously hypertensive rats, we noted a significant reduction of insulin receptors, of insulin-receptor substrate-1, and of phosphorylated-mammalian target of rapamycin. The treatment with olmesartan normalized insulin signaling, including expression of glucose transporter-4, whereas the treatment with enalapril was ineffective for the insulin receptor and less effective than olmesartan on the insulin-receptor substrate-1, phosphorylated-mammalian target of rapamycin and glucose transporter-4. There was a significant reduction in microvessel density in the skeletal muscle of spontaneously hypertensive rats compared with Wistar-Kyoto controls, and this was completely prevented by both olmesartan and enalapril.", 
    "627": "These results suggest that changes in insulin signaling occur in the skeletal muscle but not in the heart of untreated spontaneously hypertensive rats. In the skeletal muscle, insulin signaling was restored by olmesartan, whereas enalapril was less effective. Effective antihypertensive treatment with olmesartan or enalapril was associated with prevention of microvascular rarefaction.", 
    "628": "In the present study, we compared cardioprotective effects of salvianolic acid B (Sal B) and the angiotension-converting enzyme inhibitor, benazepril, in rats with large myocardial infarction (MI). The large MI was produced by coronary artery ligation for 4 weeks in rats. The rats were divided into the following groups: sham operation; MI; MI + Sal B (100 mg/kg by a gavage, once a day for 4 weeks) and MI + benazepril (1 mg/kg by a gavage, once a day for 4 weeks). Echocardiogram, hemodynamic and hemorheological changes, angiogenesis, infarct size and cardiac remodeling, as well as messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) of vascular endothelium growth factor (VEGF) were measured. The following similar effects were observed in MI rats treated with Sal B and benazepril: (1) a marked improvement of echocardiographic, hemodynamic and hemorheological parameters, (2) significant reduction of infarct size, (3) significantly attenuated heart hypertrophy, left ventricular (LV) dilatation and fibrosis. The unique effects of Sal B were: angiogenesis and augmented VEGF expression in the border and remote noninfarcted LV area. These results suggest that Sal B and benazepril exerted beneficial cardioprotective effects. However, Sal B enforced some different modality than benazepril, which might improve myocardial microcirculation by augmenting VEGF expression and promoting angiogenesis besides similar effects to benazepril.", 
    "629": "Inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) has proved to be beneficial in the treatment of various cardiovascular disorders. The aim of this study was to evaluate ACE inhibitory potential of two polyphenolic compounds with different structures: resveratrol (present in high quantities in French wine) and kaempferol (abundant in greens), using method of liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS) for ex vivo measurement of angiotensin I to angiotensin II conversion by ACE in aortic tissue of Wistar-Kyoto rats. In this setting, kaempferol (10-30-100 microM), but not resveratrol (10-30-100 microM) appeared to inhibit dose-dependently conversion of Ang I to Ang II. Although the mechanism of ACE inhibition by kaempferol remains to be elucidated, this observation may help in search or designing of new classes of ACE inhibitors.",

The aim of the present study is to evaluate the role of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in cerebral hypoperfusion-induced dementia and cholinergic dysfunction. Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CHP) was induced by permanent bilateral common carotid artery (2VO) occlusion in rats. Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion resulted in anterograde memory impairment revealed from Morris water maze (MWM) and passive avoidance step through tasks (PA), which was significantly attenuated by ACE inhibitor, captopril. Cerebral hypoperfusion down-regulated the relative expression of cholinergic muscarinic receptor (ChM-1r) and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) as well as up-regulated the angiotensin II type-1 receptor (AT-1) expression in hippocampus of vehicle treated CHP group on the 54th day post-hypoperfusion. The diminished number of presynaptic cholinergic neurons and the pyramidal neurons were evident from ChAT-immunofluorescence and the hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining studies respectively in hippocampal Cornu ammonis1 (CA1); region of vehicle-treated hypoperfused animals. Further the lipid peroxidation level was also found to be elevated in the hippocampus of the vehicle-treated group. Our results demonstrated that continuous captopril treatment (50 mg/kg, i.p. twice daily) for 15 days mitigated the hypoperfusion-induced cholinergic hypofunction and neurodegeneration in hippocampus. The present study robustly reveals that the angiotensinergic system plays a pivotal role in progression of neuronal death and memory dysfunctions during cerebral hypoperfusion.",

We compared 57 renal allograft biopsies of 44 patients with recurrent immunoglobulin A nephropathy to 43 biopsies of 33 patients without immunoglobulin A nephropathy recurrence. Clinical parameters such as patient demography and biopsy indications did not differ between the 2 groups, with the exception of time to biopsy. Renal allograft injury, which was assessed by semiquantitative scoring of glomerular, tubulointerstitial, and arteriolar changes, increased linearly over time after transplantation in both recurrent and nonrecurrent samples. Glomerular injuries were significantly correlated with tubulointerstitial injuries in both groups, but the correlation graph reflected an increasing gap in the degrees of tubulointerstitial injury between the 2 groups over time. The levels of glomerulosclerosis, mesangial proliferation, and crescent formation were significantly higher in recurrent samples, whereas the prevalence of chronic rejection was significantly higher in nonrecurrent samples. The presence of segmental sclerosis was associated with significant proteinuria in recurrent samples. Graft survival was better in recurrent immunoglobulin A nephropathy patients than in nonrecurrent patients (74.4% versus 51%) at 10 years after transplantation. In conclusion, slow and progressive glomerular injury is the major cause of long-term graft failure in patients with recurrent immunoglobulin A nephropathy. In contrast, rapidly increasing tubulointerstitial injury is responsible for graft failure in nonrecurrent patients.",

    "645": "The author describes some of the numerous domains regarding the new topic called \"Vascular endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress\". The endothelium is responsible for the constancy and integrity of the milieu interieur by producing various substances. Endothelial dysfunction occurs when there is imbalance between vasodilators and vasoconstrictors, growth factors and their inhibitors, proinflammatory and antiinflammatory agents, prothrombotic and fibrinolytic activities. The reason for this imbalance may be response to vascular endothelial or intimal injury caused by mechanical, physical, chemical, microbiological, immunologic, genetic damage or any of their combination. Endothelial dysfunction occurring on the huge inner surface of the vessels (the endothelium) is responsible for the triggering of atherosclerosis, which is a chronic vascular disease. All the risk factors of vascular pathology are leading to chronic (cardio)vascular diseases by causing endothelial dysfunction. Decreased endogenous antioxidative capacity leads to oxidative stress by free radical reactions of physiological oxidative metabolic processes, ending as the ultimate reason for endothelial dysfunction induced by risk factors. The therapeutic and preventive effects of causal antioxidant treatments having intracellular and mitochondrial effects (statins, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor-blockers, acetylsalicylic acid, and third generation beta-blockers) should be emphasized. It is also important to underline the physiological-pathophysiological-therapeutic consubstantiality and systemic nature of human vasculature and to emphasize the preventive-therapeutic significance of the vascular consequence cascade. And finally, there has been large process in the assessment of oxidative stress and consecutive endothelial dysfunction which revolutionized our clinical point of view.",

We present the case of a 24-year-old male with Noonan syndrome who presented with a diarrhoeal pro-dromal illness, acute onset chest pain, elevated cardiac biomarkers and an abnormal ECG with ST elevation in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease. The patient had acute myocarditis secondary to Campylobacter jejuni enterocolitis. Infective myocarditis is most commonly due to a viral infection. Myocarditis is very rarely due to a bacterial infection with only isolated reports of myocarditis induced by Campylobacter jejuni infection. At follow-up he remains well. Myocarditis should be considered in all patients presenting with acute onset chest pain and elevated cardiac biomarkers.", 
    "647": "The attainment of clinical blood pressure (BP) goals can markedly reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, yet approximately two-thirds of treated hypertensive patients in the United States have uncontrolled BP. Consequently, more aggressive management of hypertension, frequently involving combination therapy (e.g., fixed-dose combination [FDC] therapy), is needed to achieve the recommended BP goals of <140/90 mmHg for most patients, and <130/80 mmHg for high-risk patients.", 
    "648": "This article, based on data from an extensive Medline search ('hypertension' AND 'prescribe', 'prescribing' OR 'prescription', date range: 1995-2007), focuses on prescribing patterns for antihypertensive medication, and on the emerging role of combination therapy, specifically FDC therapy, in treating hypertensive patients to target BP levels.", 
    "649": "Although the use of antihypertensive combination therapy has increased substantially in US adults over the last 20 years, such therapy remains considerably underutilized. Numerous studies have shown that combination therapies, including FDCs, can markedly reduce BP and adverse events relative to monotherapies, and this paper overviews data for various combination therapies: angiotensin-receptor blocker (ARB) + diuretic; angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor + diuretic; calcium-channel blocker (CCB) + ACE inhibitor; and CCB + ARB. Specifically, fixed-dose CCB/ARB combinations of amlodipine with losartan, valsartan, or olmesartan medoxomil have recently been developed, and combination therapy schedules of amlodipine plus one of these ARBs have shown greater BP-lowering efficacy compared with the constituent monotherapies. Furthermore, in two large studies in a total of >3000 patients, CCB + ARB combination therapy was associated with significantly lower incidences of headache and peripheral edema than CCB monotherapy.", 
    "650": "Guidelines for hypertension management clearly support the greater use of multidrug therapy, especially in high-risk patients. FDCs (e.g., various emerging CCB/ARB combinations) are a valuable option for such high-risk patients, as these combinations offer the potential to reduce adverse events, increase compliance, lower treatment costs, and improve BP goal-attainment rates.", 
    "651": "Drug trials often exclude subjects with relevant comorbidity or comedication. Nevertheless, after approval, these drugs will be prescribed to a much broader collective. Our goal was to quantify the impact of drugs and comorbidity on serum potassium in unselected patients admitted to the hospital.", 
    "652": "This was a retrospective pharmacoepidemiologic study in 15 000 consecutive patients admitted to the medical department of the Kantonsspital St. Gallen, a 700-bed tertiary hospital in eastern Switzerland. Patients with 'haemolytic' plasma and patients on dialysis or with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) <10 mL/min/1.73 m(2) were excluded. For the remaining 14 146 patients, drug history on admission, age, sex, body weight, physical findings, comorbidity (ICD-10 diagnoses) and laboratory information (potassium and creatinine) were extracted from electronic sources.", 
    "653": "Estimated GFR was the strongest predictor of serum potassium (P < 0.0001). Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, cyclosporine, loop diuretics and potassium-sparing diuretics all showed a significant effect modification with decreasing GFR (P < 0.001). Similarly, in patients with liver cirrhosis a significantly stronger effect on potassium was found for angiotensin receptor blockers, betablockers and loop diuretics (P < 0.01). Several significant drug-drug interactions were identified. Diabetes, male sex, older age, lower blood pressure and higher body weight were all independently associated with higher serum potassium levels (P < 0.001). The model explained 14% of the variation of serum potassium.", 
    "654": "The effects of various drugs on serum potassium are highly influenced by comorbidity and comedication. Although the presented model cannot be used to predict potassium in individual patients, we demonstrate that clinical databases could evolve as a powerful tool for industry-independent analysis of postmarketing drug safety.", 
    "655": "It is unknown whether adherence to recommended medications after myocardial infarction (MI) differs by kidney function.", 
    "656": "This was a retrospective cohort study of older patients who were discharged after MI in two Eastern states between 1995 and 2004. Patients were categorized as having ESRD, having chronic kidney disease (CKD), and being free from diagnosed CKD. Use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ACEI/ARB), beta blockers (BB), and statins was assessed within 30 d after discharge. Good adherence was defined as proportion of days covered >80% during the first year after discharge.", 
    "657": "Compared with patients with no CKD, patients with CKD had 22% lower adjusted use of ACEI/ARB but similar rates of BB and statin use. Patients with ESRD experienced 43% lower ACEI/ARB and 17% lower statin use. Only 64% (BB), 57% (statins), and 54% (ACEI/ARB) of patients had good 1-yr adherence. Adherence was similar between patients with CKD and with no CKD for all study drugs. Fewer patients with ESRD had good adherence to BB.", 
    "658": "With the exception of lower ACEI/ARB use in patients with CKD, we found no differences between patients with CKD and with no CKD in their use of and adherence to these cardiovascular medications after MI. Patients with ESRD experienced lower use of ACEI/ARB and statins and lower adherence to BB regimens. Postulated differences in medication use after MI across levels of kidney function are unlikely to explain the observed differences in long-term outcomes.", 
    "659": "A number of analytical methods were reported for the estimation of atorvastatin and ramipril from their individual dosage forms or in combination with other drugs (Valiyare, 2004; Vachareau and Neirinck, 2000). Here successful reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatographic method and spectroscopic methods developed then validated for the analysis of combined dosage form of atorvastatin and ramipril. Individual lambda-max for atorvastatin is 247 n.m and that of ramipril is 208 n.m. They intercept at 215 n.m which is fixed as wavelength for reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatographic method.", 
    "660": "This study has been initiated to determine whether captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor containing sulfhydryl (-SH) group can protect against cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in rats. A single dose of cisplatin (7.5 mg/kg bwt) injected i.p. caused a significant increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels amounting to 402% and 573%, respectively with a marked elevation in lipid peroxides measured as malondialdehyde (MDA) content (54%), accompanied by a significant decrease in reduced glutathione (GSH) content (27%) of kidney tissue as compared to control group. In addition, there were marked increases in kidney tissue content of nitric oxide (NO) (43%) and plasma endothelin-1(ET-1) (37%). On the other hand, administration of captopril (60 mg/kg bwt, i.p.) 1 h before cisplatin protected the kidney as indicated by restoration of BUN, creatinine, MDA, GSH, NO and ET-1. These results indicate that captopril, an ACEI, has a protective effect against cisplatin-induced damage to kidney. This reflects the beneficial role of captopril in treatment of renovascular hypertention and congestive heart failure; an effect that may be related to its free radicals scavenging and antioxidant effects which are sulfhydryl dependent.", 
    "661": "Observational epidemiological studies have shown a positive association between hypertension and risk of incident dementia; however, the effects of antihypertensive therapy on cognitive function in controlled trials have been conflicting, and meta-analyses of the trials have not provided clear evidence of whether antihypertensive treatment reduces dementia incidence. The Hypertension in the Very Elderly trial (HYVET) was designed to assess the risks and benefits of treatment of hypertension in elderly patients and included an assessment of cognitive function.", 
    "662": "Patients with hypertension (systolic pressure 160-200 mm Hg; diastolic pressure <110 mm Hg) who were aged 80 years or older were enrolled in this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Participants were randomly assigned to receive 1.5 mg slow release indapamide, with the option of 2-4 mg perindopril, or placebo. The target systolic blood pressure was 150 mm Hg; the target diastolic blood pressure was 80 mm Hg. Participants had no clinical diagnosis of dementia at baseline, and cognitive function was assessed at baseline and annually with the mini-mental state examination (MMSE). Possible cases of incident dementia (a fall in the MMSE score to <24 points or a drop of three points in 1 year) were assessed by standard diagnostic criteria and expert review. The trial was stopped in 2007 at the second interim analysis after treatment resulted in a reduction in stroke and total mortality. Analysis was by intention to treat. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00122811.", 
    "663": "3336 HYVET participants had at least one follow-up assessment (mean 2.2 years) and were included: 1687 participants were randomly assigned to the treatment group and 1649 to the placebo group. Only five reports of adverse effects were attributed to the medication: three in the placebo group and two in the treatment group. The mean decrease in systolic blood pressure between the treatment and placebo groups at 2 years was systolic -15 mm Hg, p<0.0001; and diastolic -5.9 mm Hg, p<0.0001. There were 263 incident cases of dementia. The rates of incident dementia were 38 per 1000 patient-years in the placebo group and 33 per 1000 patient-years in the treatment group. There was no significant difference between treatment and placebo groups (hazard ratio [HR] 0.86, 95% CI 0.67-1.09); however, when these data were combined in a meta-analysis with other placebo-controlled trials of antihypertensive treatment, the combined risk ratio favoured treatment (HR 0.87, 0.76-1.00, p=0.045).", 
    "664": "Antihypertensive treatment in elderly patients does not statistically reduce incidence of dementia. This negative finding might have been due to the short follow-up, owing to the early termination of the trial, or the modest effect of treatment. Nevertheless, the HYVET findings, when included in a meta-analysis, might support antihypertensive treatment to reduce incident dementia.", 
    "665": "In randomized clinical trials, aldosterone antagonists have been shown to reduce mortality and morbidity in heart failure (HF). The aim of the present study was to examine the risk-benefit profile of aldosterone antagonists in routine clinical practice.", 
    "666": "A retrospective analysis, extending over a 1-year period, of the clinical, instrumental and laboratory data of 264 HF outpatients was performed. All patients were on a beta-blocker and an ACE-inhibitor (or angiotensin-II receptor-blocker) and 151 were taking an aldosterone antagonist.", 
    "667": "At baseline, subjects treated with aldosterone antagonists had a higher NYHA class, a larger left-ventricular end-diastolic volume, a worse ejection fraction and a higher systolic pulmonary arterial pressure (sPAP). During follow-up, a greater reduction in sPAP and a tendency towards improved systolic and diastolic function were observed in subjects treated with aldosterone antagonists. Moreover, clinical and laboratory parameters did not deteriorate in patients taking aldosterone antagonists. Mortality rates were similar in the two groups (8.6% vs. 8.8%, P = NS).", 
    "668": "The use of aldosterone antagonists in HF is associated with an improvement in cardiac function and is well tolerated. In the present study, patients administered these agents had a comparable clinical outcome to that of the control group, despite important differences in baseline risk.", 
    "669": "We recently reported that para-nonylphenol, an environmental chemical, induced hydroxyl radical (*OH) formation in rat striatum. In this study we examined the antioxidant effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (captopril or enalaprilat) on para-nonylphenol (nonylphenol) and 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP(+))-induced hydroxyl radical (*OH) formation and dopamine (DA) efflux in extracellular fluid of rat striatum, using a microdialysis technique. para-Nonylphenol clearly enhanced *OH formation and DA efflux induced by MPP(+). When captopril or enalaprilat was infused in nonylphenol and MPP(+)-treated rats, DA efflux and OH formation significantly decreased, as compared with that in the nonylphenol and MPP(+)-treated control. We compared the ability of non-SH-containing enalaprilat with a SH-containing captopril to scavenge OH and DA efflux. Both inhibitors were able to scavenge *OH and DA efflux induced by para-nonylphenol and MPP(+). The results suggest that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may protect against nonylphenol and MPP(+)-induced *OH formation via suppressing DA efflux in the rat striatum.", 
    "670": "Aliskiren is the first orally bioavailable direct renin inhibitor approved for the treatment of hypertension. It acts at the point of activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, or renin system, inhibiting the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I by renin and thereby reducing the formation of angiotensin II by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and ACE-independent pathways. Aliskiren is a highly potent inhibitor of human renin in vitro (concentration of aliskiren that produces 50% inhibition of renin 0.6 nmol/L). Aliskiren is rapidly absorbed following oral administration, with maximum plasma concentrations reached within 1-3 hours. The absolute bioavailability of aliskiren is 2.6%. The binding of aliskiren to plasma proteins is moderate (47-51%) and is independent of the concentration. Once absorbed, aliskiren is eliminated through the hepatobiliary route as unchanged drug and, to a lesser extent, through oxidative metabolism by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4. Unchanged aliskiren accounts for approximately 80% of the drug in the plasma following oral administration, indicating low exposure to metabolites. The two major oxidized metabolites of aliskiren account for less than 5% of the drug in the plasma at the time of the maximum concentration. Aliskiren excretion is almost completely via the biliary/faecal route; 0.6% of the dose is recovered in the urine. Steady-state plasma concentrations of aliskiren are reached after 7-8 days of once-daily dosing, and the accumulation factor for aliskiren is approximately 2. After reaching the peak, the aliskiren plasma concentration declines in a multiphasic fashion. No clinically relevant effects of gender or race on the pharmacokinetics of aliskiren are observed, and no adjustment of the initial aliskiren dose is required for elderly patients or for patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Aliskiren showed no clinically significant increases in exposure during coadministration with a wide range of potential concomitant medications, although increases in exposure were observed with P-glycoprotein inhibitors. Aliskiren does not inhibit or induce CYP isoenzyme or P-glycoprotein activity, although aliskiren is a substrate for P-glycoprotein, which contributes to its relatively low bioavailability. Aliskiren is approved for the treatment of hypertension at once-daily doses of 150 mg and 300 mg. Phase II and III clinical studies involving over 12,000 patients with hypertension have demonstrated that aliskiren provides effective long-term blood pressure (BP) lowering with a good safety and tolerability profile at these doses. Aliskiren inhibits plasma renin activity (PRA) by up to 80% following both single and multiple oral-dose administration. Similar reductions in PRA are observed when aliskiren is administered in combination with agents that alone increase PRA, including diuretics (hydrochlorothiazide, furosemide [frusemide]), ACE inhibitors (ramipril) and angiotensin receptor blockers (valsartan), despite greater increases in the plasma renin concentration. Moreover, PRA inhibition and BP reductions persist for 2-4 weeks after stopping treatment, which is likely to be of benefit in patients with hypertension who occasionally miss a dose of medication. Preliminary data on the antiproteinuric effects of aliskiren in type 2 diabetes mellitus suggest that renoprotective effects beyond BP lowering may be possible. Further studies to evaluate the effects of aliskiren on cardiovascular outcomes and target organ protection are ongoing and will provide important new data on the role of direct renin inhibition in the management of hypertension and other cardiovascular disease.", 
    "671": "The angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory oligopeptide-enriched hydrolysates from Acetes chinensis by treatment with the protease from Bacillus sp. SM98011 were produced at pilot scale (100 L) and plant scale (1000 L). The pilot and plant scaled hydrolysate products almost had the same properties as that at laboratory scale. Spray-drying had little effect on the peptide composition and bioactivity of the hydrolysates. The plant scaled hydrolysates were used to study its blood pressure-depressing effect in vivo. It caused reduce of 18.3-38.6 mmHg of the blood pressure of spontaneously hypertensive rats in dose-dependent manner in the range of 100-1,200 mg/kg/day. Histopathologic study showed that the pathologic changes of heart and brain in SHRs got obvious alleviation after treatment of the hydrolysates.", 
    "672": "End-stage renal disease (ESRD) poses steadily growing challenges to health care systems worldwide. Renal replacement therapy with hemodialysis (HD) or kidney transplantation is the only possibility for ESRD patient survival. A complete correction of anemia in HD patients may lead to an increased risk of vascular arteriovenous fistula (AVF) primary failure; some studies have demonstrated that decreased levels of hemoglobin (Hb) had adverse effects on cardiac and brain function. This study was designed to evaluate the impact of different risk factors, especially the Hb level on AVF survival.", 
    "673": "Prospective observational data were analyzed from a non-randomized sample (n=100) of HD patients who were referred for first AVF creation between April 2005 and December 2006 with <1 month on HD. The relative risk (RR) of access primary failure was evaluated in four different groups of patients divided according to their Hb levels (<8, 8-10, 10-12, and >12 g/dL). Other factors possibly influencing vascular access (VA) survival were also considered including gender, age, smoking, diabetes, hypertension, parathyroid hormone levels, ACE inhibitor intake and triglyceride levels. The analyses were performed using SPSS v.11.5, Kaplan-Meier analysis, Cox's regression and log rank test.", 
    "674": "There was a statistically significant higher risk of AVF primary failure in patients with Hb <8 g/dL (RR=1.41; p=0.01), diabetes (RR=1.21; p=0.05), age>60 yrs (RR=1.41; p=0.06) were identified as predictive factors for AVF primary failure. ACE inhibitor intake (RR=0.45; p=0.01) was found to be protective.", 
    "675": "Correction of serum Hb level can lead to a better result in VA survival and ACE inhibitor intake was found to be a protective factor.", 
    "676": "In this work, the impact of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was investigated on the thiol content of asparagus. Fresh-cut asparagus was treated with H2O2 at varied oxidant concentrations and contact times. A significant decrease (alpha=0.05) was observed in N-acetylcysteine levels treated with 2.5% H2O2 for 10 min and with 5% H2O2 for 3, 5 and 10 min. Captopril and cysteine levels significantly decreased (alpha=0.05) in all and most treatment conditions, respectively. Glutathione levels only significantly decreased with 2.5% and 5% H2O2 for 10 min treatment. In order to determine whether asparagus undergoes oxidative stress, a well-known oxidative stress indicator-the glutathione/oxidized glutathione ratio-was calculated. This study showed that the common use of H2O2 as a disinfectant/sterilizer by the food industry could markedly diminish the important biothiols and develop oxidative stress in asparagus, and potentially in other vegetables as well.", 
    "677": "Diuretics have been the cornerstone of acute heart failure (AHF) therapy for >200 years, although the treatment of chronic heart failure has changed dramatically over the past decades with the introduction of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, beta-blockers, and aldosterone inhibitors. These treatment modalities were never tested prospectively in the acute setting. Furthermore, there is a significant lack of prospective data on the use of diuretics in both chronic (CHF) and AHF. Hence, despite lack of knowledge on their efficacy and safety, diuretics remain an essential component of the current management of AHF and CHF. In the present manuscript we will address the practical concerns regarding diuretic selection, dosage, combination regimens, and the importance of achieving clinical improvement with minimal changes to kidney function in patients with AHF. Heart Fail Monit 2008;6(1):9-19.", 
    "678": "Commentaries and debates at national medical meetings have fuelled the controversy about treatment of hypertension in patients aged 80 years and older. A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was, therefore, indicated to settle the dispute about whether antihypertensive drug therapy is efficacious or harmful in these patients. Results from HYVET (Hypertension in the Very Elderly Trial) showed that, at 2-year follow-up, antihypertensive drug therapy with indapamide, plus perindopril if needed, reduced fatal or nonfatal stroke by 30%, fatal stroke by 39%, all-cause mortality by 21%, cardiovascular death by 23%, and heart failure by 64%. These results indicate that hypertensive patients aged 80 years and older should be treated with antihypertensive drugs.", 
    "679": "Cardiovascular disease is understood as a continuum; risk factors induce a pathophysiologic cascade that culminates in end-organ failure. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) influences multiple aspects of the pathophysiology via hemodynamic and nonhemodynamic effects. Many long-term clinical trials provide overwhelming evidence of benefits of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) across the cardiovascular continuum, including benefits regarding hypertension, myocardial infarction, stroke, renal disease, and heart failure. Trials also indicate additive or synergistic effects of combination therapy in renal disease and heart failure, a possibility supported by the basic biochemistry of the agents. Discussion of these trials is included in part 1 of this 2-part review. Part 2 of the review will discuss the extensive interaction of the RAS with the cellular and molecular pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease and the cross-continuum effects of ARBs and ACE inhibitors, which raise the possibility that RAS inhibition can offer protection in high-risk patients who do not have symptoms. The benefits of combined ACE inhibitor/ARB therapy in high-risk patients await confirmation; ongoing clinical research in this area will be discussed.", 
    "680": "Renovascular hypertension, the most common remediable cause of elevated blood pressure, is a controversial topic, but most authorities agree on several principles. The absolute risk of renovascular hypertension for a specific patient can be estimated using only clinical information, thereby sparing many patients further expensive and potentially dangerous evaluations. Patients with a high absolute risk of renovascular hypertension should have angiography only if they are willing to undergo revascularization if warranted. A screening test (captopril renography, Doppler ultrasonography, magnetic resonance angiography, or computed tomography) is recommended for those with an intermediate absolute risk. Angioplasty should be offered to patients with fibromuscular dysplasia. Whether intensive medical therapy (including an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker) for atherosclerotic renovascular hypertension is improved by angioplasty plus stent placement may be answered by ongoing studies, the largest of which may be the National Institutes of Health-funded Cardiovascular Outcomes in Renal Atherosclerotic Lesions (CORAL) trial.", 
    "681": "The incidence of enalapril-induced cough was evaluated in 199 patients with congestive heart failure. Cough was more frequent in class I or II patients (28%) than in class III (4.1%, p<0.01) and class IV (0%, p<0.01) patients. Brain natriuretic peptide level was lower in patients in the cough (+) group than in the cough (-) group (170+/-107 vs. 538+/-637 pg/ml, p<0.01). The incidence of enalapril-induced cough is low in patients with severe congestive heart failure and a cough can be a marker of non-severe heart failure.", 
    "682": "The effects of high dose captopril, within the therapeutic range, on autonomic activity are unknown in those with normal cardiovascular function. Thus the study aims were to assess the effects of high dose captopril on autonomic function in mice. Autonomic activity was measured using heart rate variability (HRV). ECG recordings were obtained from 18 Male C57BL/6J mice (20-25 g) subdivided into control (N=8) or mice receiving oral captopril (0.688 mg/ml captopril in the drinking water for 6 weeks, N=10). HRV results for linear and non-linear parameters were attenuated following chronic captopril for 6 weeks compared to control. Captopril was associated with a trend for an increase in average heart rate and approximate entropy (ApEn), a non-linear measure of HRV decreased significantly compared to control (p<0.05). In conclusion high dose captopril reduces total HRV and increases heart rate in normotensive mice with normal cardiac function.", 
    "683": "Recently, we have demonstrated a direct correlation among hyperglycaemia, vascular dysfunction and eNOS post-translational regulation in non non-obese diabetic mice (NOD). Here, we evaluate the impact of two ACE-inhibitors therapy, zofenopril and enalapril in NOD mice. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) development was monitored weekly through glycosuria measurement. Zofenopril and enalapril were dosed at 0.5 mg/kg/die orally. Animals were sacrificed at different points and aortas used for western blotting or for tissue bath experiments. Bovine aortic endothelial cells in high glucose medium are treated with zofenoprilat or enalaprilat. Cells and supernatant were utilised for western blot analysis and for nitrite/nitrate determination, respectively. In ex-vivo experiments chronic administration of both drugs restored PE-induced contraction but not Isop-induced vasodilatation, however only zofenopril reduced caveolin-1 expression. In vitro, both drugs inhibited caveolin-1 expression and increased NOx production. However, zofenopril caused inhibition of both parameters at a concentration 200 fold lower than enalalpril. In vivo, zofenopril delays the onset of diabetic conditions of about 50%, and ameliorates polyuria. In conclusion our data suggest that ACE-inhibitor therapy may be useful in IDDM, in particular sulphydrylated inhibitor would display a better efficacy especially if administered early on the development of diabetes.", 
    "684": "The rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) have decreased significantly for men over the past few decades, but similar reductions have not occurred in women. Consequently, CVD remains the leading killer of women in the United States. Men usually develop heart disease earlier than women, but women develop heart disease more rapidly once menopause has occurred. A review of risk factors that are common between men and women demonstrates some notable sex-dependent differences. Many of these changes appear related to the hormonal changes that occur in menopause, such as the development of hypertension, changes in lipid concentrations, and central adiposity. In addition, diabetes is a more significant risk factor for CVD in women than men. Sociologic and physiologic factors need to be considered in treatment of risk factors, such as smoking, lack of exercise, obesity, and depression. Prevention is known to significantly reduce CVD risk, but new goals are being established for women as the sex-dependent differences have become apparent.",

    "687": "Median age of the patients was 26 days (range 6-310 days), median weight 3.5 kg (range 1.9-7.9 kg). Initial median dose of captopril was 0.17 mg/kg/day (range 0.05-0.55 mg/kg/day), slowly increased over 3-33 days to a maximal median dose of 1.86 mg/kg/day (range 0.2-2.3 mg/kg/day). All patients were additionally treated with diuretics. Side effects occurred in 17 patients (renal impairment or failure in 6, low blood pressure in 8, and oxygen saturation deficit in 3) requiring cessation or interruption in seven patients with renal impairment/failure (n=4), hypotension (n=1) and aorto-pulmonary shunting with low pulmonary perfusion (n=2). The six children who developed renal impairment or failure did so following a median delay of nine days after reaching the final dose and weighed on average 500 g less than the other patients (P=0.046). All side effects were fully reversible.", 
    "688": "Side effects due to captopril were not dose-related in newborns and infants in this study. However, renal side effects occurred more often in smaller infants. Routine monitoring of infants on ACEI should include renal function tests, blood pressure and transcutaneous oxygen saturation measurements.", 
    "689": "The electrochemical behavior of the antihypertensive drug quinapril was investigated at a hanging mercury drop electrode using different voltammetric techniques such as cyclic voltammetry, square-wave voltammetry and chronoamperometry. A simple and sensitive square-wave voltammetric method for the electrochemical analysis of quinapril in its pharmaceutical formulations was developed and validated. The experimental and instrumental parameters affecting the peak current of quinapril were investigated. Various buffers such as Britton Robinson, borate and phosphate buffers at different pH values (3.0-11.0) were examined as supporting electrolyte. The optimum conditions were obtained using Britton Robinson buffer at pH 10.0 and frequency: 50 Hz, scan increment: 4 mV and pulse amplitude: 25 mV. A well-defined peak current was observed at the hanging mercury drop electrode at -1100 mV vs. Ag/AgCl reference electrode. This proposed method was validated by evaluating linearity, sensitivity, repeatability, accuracy, precision, selectivity, recovery, robustness and ruggedness. The linear calibration range was 0.50-8.68 microg mL-' (r = 0.9992). The detection and quantification limits of this method were 0.22 and 0.50 Ctg mL(-1) and intra-day and inter-day precision were between 0.81-4.32% (n = 7), respectively. The developed method was applied successfully for the determination of quinapril in its tablet dosage forms. The average amount of quinapril in tablets was found as 20.26 +/- 0.12 with RSD of 1.60% for 20 mg tabletsand 40.55 +/- 0.23 with RSD of 1.52% for 40 mg tablets.",

Whether and how to treat MN is still a controversial question. Despite the use of corticosteroids and alkylating agents, up to 40% of patients still progress to end-stage renal failure.", 
    "691": "A 40-year-old male patient with biopsy-proven idiopathic MN was initially treated with prednisolone and chlorambucil because of a proteinuria of 22 g/d. Treatment with cyclosporine was started because the nephrotic syndrome failed to improve. Proteinuria was reduced to a minimum of 4 g/d. Cyclosporine was stopped after 17 months leading to a fast relapse. Therapy with an ACE inhibitor and AT(1) receptor antagonist and retreatment with cyclosporine improved proteinuria. Cyclosporine was terminated after a total of 24 months. 5 months later, relapse occurred with a high proteinuria of 34 g/d. The monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody rituximab (375 mg/m(2)) was given four times every 4 weeks. 4 weeks and 4 months after the end of treatment, proteinuria decreased to 780 mg/d and <150 mg/d, but renal function remained impaired (creatinine clearance 65 ml/min, stage 2 according to K/DOQI). Now, remission of proteinuria (<150 mg/d) has been stable for almost 2 years. However, renal insufficiency progressed further (creatinine clearance 45 ml/min, stage 3 according to K/DOQI).", 
    "692": "Rituximab offers the possibility for a targeted treatment of idiopathic MN. Based on the existing evidence and experience from this case, rituximab can be recommended as a new treatment option for MN, possibly before starting any treatment with cytotoxic agents and high-dose prednisolone carrying the risk of severe side effects. However, long-term results of this treatment are still lacking.", 
    "693": "Although left ventricular restoration is effective for treating ischemic cardiomyopathy caused by left ventricular remodeling and redilation, the initial improvement in left ventricular function is not always sustained. We have reported that the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers is effective in preventing late remodeling after left ventricular restoration. However, the effects of spironolactone--an aldosterone blocker--after left ventricular restoration have not been elucidated.", 
    "694": "Myocardial infarction was induced by ligating the left anterior descending artery. The rats developed left ventricular aneurysms and underwent left ventricular restoration by the plication of the left ventricular aneurysm 4 weeks after the ligation. Thereafter, the rats were randomized into a left ventricular restoration (vehicle) group and left ventricular restoration with spironolactone (100 mg/kg/d, by mouth) group.", 
    "695": "Echocardiography revealed that in the left ventricular restoration with spironolactone group, late cardiac redilation was significantly attenuated (left ventricular end-diastolic area: 0.51 +/- 0.03 cm(2) vs 0.63 +/- 0.03 cm(2), P < .05) and late left ventricular function was preserved (fractional area change: 48.8% +/- 3.0% vs 35.8% +/- 2.4%, P < .01). Hemodynamically, rats in the left ventricular restoration with spironolactone group exhibited improved systolic function (maximal end-systolic pressure-volume relationship: 0.38 +/- 0.03 mm Hg/microL vs 0.11 +/- 0.04 mm Hg/microL, P < .01) and diastolic function (tau: 18.5 +/- 1.5 sec vs 23.1 +/- 1.4 sec, P < .05) than those in the LVR group. Histologically, interstitial fibrosis in the remote area was significantly reduced (5.6% +/- 1.3% vs 12% +/- 1.0%, P < .01), and fibrosis around the pledgets (near area) was also attenuated in the left ventricular restoration with spironolactone group. The myocardial messenger ribonucleic acid expressions of transforming growth factor-beta1 and brain natriuretic peptide measured using the real-time polymerase chain reaction were lower in the left ventricular restoration with spironolactone group (transforming growth factor-beta1: 0.13 +/- 0.02 vs 0.28 +/- 0.02, P < .01; brain natriuretic peptide: 0.99 +/- 0.14 vs 1.54 +/- 0.18, P < .05). The systemic blood pressure and heart rate did not differ between the 2 groups.", 
    "696": "Spironolactone reduced the gene expression of transforming growth factor-beta1 and brain natriuretic peptide and alleviated not only cardiac redilation but also the deterioration of left ventricular function late after left ventricular restoration without inducing hypotension, a major side effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blocker. Spironolactone is a promising therapeutic option for alleviating remodeling after left ventricular restoration.", 
    "697": "Inflammation is an important factor in the development and progression of atherosclerosis. Observational studies have suggested that renin-angiotensin system inhibition might lower C-reactive protein (CRP). The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition with fosinopril would reduce inflammation in a placebo-controlled trial involving 621 subjects. CRP was determined using a high-sensitivity assay at baseline and after 3 months of fosinopril treatment. The median CRP level at baseline was 1.38 mg/dl (interquartile range 0.64 to 2.86) and did not significantly differ between treatment groups. CRP levels at baseline were significantly associated with future cardiovascular events, even after adjustment for age and gender (odds ratio 1.76, 95% confidence interval 1.16 to 2.67, p = 0.008). Fosinopril treatment during 3 months did not result in a significantly higher reduction of CRP levels compared with placebo (difference -0.11, p = 0.20). Exploratory analysis suggested an interaction between gender and fosinopril treatment on CRP reduction (p = 0.07). Male gender was associated with a significantly larger reduction in CRP compared to female gender. In conclusion, contrary to previous observational studies, no effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition on CRP levels was found.",

In the present investigation we report the inhibitory activity against digestive enzymes related to diabetes and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) of extracts of nine plant species collected in Lebanon, where they have a traditional use against diabetes.", 
    "699": "In order to evaluate if the extraction procedure could influence the activity we decided to perform different extractions with methanol, n-hexane and chloroform of Calamintha origanifolia, Satureja thymbra, Prangos asperula, Sideritis perfoliata, Asperula glomerata, Hyssopus officinalis, Erythraea centaurium, Marrubium radiatum and Salvia acetabulosa and test each of them.", 
    "700": "Marrubium radiatum and Salvia acetabulosa methanol extracts exerted the highest activity against alpha-amylase (IC(50) 61.1 and 91.2 microg/ml, respectively) and alpha-glucosidase (IC(50) 68.8 and 76.9 microg/ml, respectively). The same extracts exhibited a strong inhibitory activity against ACE with IC(50) of 72.7 and 52.7 microg/ml, respectively. The results support the traditional use of some the species examined.", 
    "701": "Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are mobilized from the bone marrow into the peripheral circulation, home to sites of injury, and incorporate into foci of neovascularization, thereby improving blood flow and tissue recovery. Patients with cardiovascular diseases, including coronary artery disease, heart failure, hypertension, and diabetes, have been shown to exhibit reduced number and functional capacity of EPCs. Considerable evidence indicates that EPCs constitute an important endogenous system to maintain endothelial integrity and vascular homeostasis, while reduced number of EPCs has recently been shown to predict future cardiovascular events. Thus, enhancement of EPCs could be of potential benefit for individuals with cardiovascular diseases. The interplay between inflammation and oxidative stress is involved in the initiation, progression, and complications of cardiovascular diseases. Emerging evidence from in vitro and clinical studies suggests that inflammatory and oxidative changes influence EPC mobilization. Drugs with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, currently administered to patients with cardiovascular diseases, such as statins, have been demonstrated to exert beneficial effects on EPC biology. A better understanding of the inflammatory and oxidative mechanisms leading to the numerical and functional impairment of EPCs would provide additional insight into the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease and create novel therapeutic targets.", 
    "702": "Several findings suggest that catecholaminergic neurons in the caudal ventrolateral medulla (CVLM) contribute to body fluid homeostasis and cardiovascular regulation. From the CVLM other areas in central nervous system involved in cardiovascular regulation and hydroelectrolyte balance can be activated. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of lesions of these neurons on 0.3M NaCl and water intake induced by subcutaneous injection of furosemide (FURO)+captopril (CAP) or 36 h of water deprivation/partial hydration with only water (WD/PR). Male Wistar rats (320-360 g) were submitted to medullary catecholaminergic neuron lesions by microinjection of anti-dopamine-beta-hydroxylase-saporin (anti-DbetaH-saporin; 6.3 ng in 60 nl) into the CVLM (SAP-rats). Sham rats received microinjections of free saporin (1.3 ng in 60 nl) in the same region. In SAP-rats, the 0.3M NaCl intake was increased after FURO+CAP (6.8+/-1.0 ml/2h, vs. sham: 3.7+/-0.7 ml/2h) as well as after WD/PR (11.1+/-1.3 ml/2h vs. sham: 6.1+/-1.8 ml/2h). Conversely, in SAP-rats, the water intake induced by FURO+CAP (14.8+/-1.3 ml/2h, vs. sham: 14.1+/-1.6 ml/2h) or by WD/PR (3.6+/-0.9 ml/2h, vs. sham: 3.2+/-1.1 ml/2h) was not different from sham rats. Immunohistochemical analysis indicates that microinjections of anti-DbetaH-saporin produced extensive destruction within the A1 cell groups in the CVLM. These results suggest an inhibitory role for medullary catecholaminergic neurons on sodium appetite.", 
    "703": "The first naturally occurring angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors described are pyroglutamyl proline-rich oligopeptides, found in the venom of the viper Bothrops jararaca, and named as bradykinin-potentiating peptides (BPPs). Biochemical and pharmacological properties of these peptides were essential for the development of Captopril, the first active site-directed inhibitor of ACE, currently used for the treatment of human hypertension. However, a number of data have suggested that the pharmacological activity of BPPs could not only be explained by their inhibitory action on enzymatic activity of somatic ACE. In fact, we showed recently that the strong and long-lasting anti-hypertensive effect of BPP-10c [<ENWPHPQIPP] is independent of somatic ACE inhibition. On the other hand, nicotinic acetylcholine receptors expressed in blood vessels have been related to blood pressure regulation. Therefore, we have studied the effects of BPP-10c on acetylcholine receptor function in the PC12 pheochromocytoma cell line, which following induction to neuronal differentiation expresses most of the nicotinic receptor subtypes. BPP-10c did not induce receptor-mediated ion flux, nor potentiated carbamoylcholine-provoked receptor activity as determined by whole-cell recording. This peptide, however, alleviated MK-801-induced inhibition of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor activity. Although more data are needed for understanding the mechanism of the BPP-10c effect on nicotinic receptor activity and its relationship with the anti-hypertensive activity, this work reveals possible therapeutic applications for BPP-10c in establishing normal acetylcholine receptor activity.", 
    "704": "1 The hypothesis that alpha(1D)-adrenoceptors may mediate the pro-hypertensive actions of angiotensin II (Ang II) was tested in isolated aorta (alpha(1D)-adrenoceptor bearing tissue) of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor null mouse (AhR(-/-)), which shows increased levels of Ang II, cardiac hypertrophy and hypertension. 2 The effect of captopril (an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor) on both blood pressure and aortic alpha(1D)-adrenoceptor expression and function in mice were determined. 3 Basal blood pressure was higher in AhR(-/-) mice, while captopril therapy decreased it to wild-type (WT) values. 4 Aortas of adult WT and AhR(-/-) mice were stimulated by phenylephrine or noradrenaline to induce contraction; the maximal effect was higher in AhR(-/-) mice, without a significant change in pEC(50). 5 PA(2) values for the selective alpha(1D)-adrenoceptor antagonist BMY 7378 (8-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazynil]ethyl]-8-azaspiro [4.5]decane-7,9-dione) were 9.19 and 8.94 for WT and AhR(-/-), respectively; while Schild slopes were not different from 1. 6 PCR experiments showed c. 77% increase in AhR(-/-)alpha(1D)-adrenoceptors cDNA compared with WT mice; while western blot analysis demonstrated c. 88% increase in alpha(1D)-adrenoceptor protein in AhR(-/-) mice. 7 Captopril therapy decreased alpha(1D)-adrenoceptor-induced contraction and protein in AhR(-/-) mice to WT levels. 8 These data support the hypothesis that under conditions where Ang II is elevated, vascular alpha(1D)-adrenoceptors are increased, and further suggest that both Ang II and vascular alpha(1D)-adrenoceptors could be related in the onset of hypertension.", 
    "705": "Commonly consumed carbohydrate sweeteners derived from sugar cane, palm, and corn (syrups) were investigated to determine their potential to inhibit key enzymes relevant to Type 2 diabetes and hypertension based on the total phenolic content and antioxidant activity using in vitro models. Among sugar cane derivatives, brown sugars showed higher antidiabetes potential than white sugars; nevertheless, no angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition was detected in both sugar classes. Brown sugar from Peru and Mauritius (dark muscovado) had the highest total phenolic content and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity, which correlated with a moderate inhibition of yeast alpha-glucosidase without showing a significant effect on porcine pancreatic alpha-amylase activity. In addition, chlorogenic acid quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography was detected in these sugars (128 +/- 6 and 144 +/- 2 microg/g of sample weight, respectively). Date sugar exhibited high alpha-glucosidase, alpha-amylase, and ACE inhibitory activities that correlated with high total phenolic content and antioxidant activity. Neither phenolic compounds or antioxidant activity was detected in corn syrups, indicating that nonphenolic factors may be involved in their significant ability to inhibit alpha-glucosidase, alpha-amylase, and ACE. This study provides a strong biochemical rationale for further in vivo studies and useful information to make better dietary sweetener choices for Type 2 diabetes and hypertension management.", 
    "706": "Traditional herbal remedies still form an integral part of South African culture, hence necessitating reports on the scientific rationale for their uses. Organic and aqueous extracts from 16 nutritive plants found in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa were screened for angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity using a fluorometric enzyme assay. A plant was considered to have potential antihypertensive properties if it inhibited the ACE enzyme and thus the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II by greater than 50%. Eight of the 16 plants screened demonstrated ACE inhibitory activity and satisfied these criteria. These eight plants were then subjected to a gelatin salt block test for tannins to show that the ACE inhibitory activities were not due to the presence of tannins, as tannins also inhibit ACE activity. The plants that showed ACE inhibitory activity were Amaranthus dubius, Amaranthus hybridus, Asystasia gangetica, Galinsoga parviflora, Justicia flava, Oxygonum sinuatum, Physalis viscosa, and Tulbaghia violacea. T. violacea in particular shows promise with regards to ACE inhibition as in vivo administration of this extract showed only a 2.2% increase in maximum mean arterial pressure when compared to the 14.5% increase observed in the control group after co-administration with exogenous Ang I.", 
    "707": "The hypoglycemic effect of an aqueous extract of Picrorrhiza Rhizoma (PR) was investigated on diabetic nephropathy. The body weight of each of eight rats per group was measured 7 days after streptozotocin (STZ) treatment. The blood glucose levels 3 days after STZ treatment and the changes in body weight, kidney weight, blood glucose levels, and serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were also measured, and the histopathology of the kidney was examined. Body weight decreases and increases of kidney weight, blood glucose levels, and serum BUN and creatinine levels were detected in the diabetic control with histopathological changes related to diabetic nephropathy in the kidney. However, the level of hyperglycemia was significantly lowered in all groups given the PR extract. In addition, the changes related to diabetic nephropathy with the body weight were also significantly lower in the captopril and all PR extract-dosing groups than in the diabetic control. In conclusion, an aqueous extract of PR has relatively good inhibitory effects on STZ-induced diabetes with early diabetic nephropathy with a similar efficacy to an equal dose of captopril.",

Cox proportional hazards models were constructed to assess the relationship between HbA1c levels and recurrent cardiac events (assessed as continuous and categorical measures) after adjustment for potential confounding variables.", 
    "710": "Of 5663 patients identified within an incident cardiac event between January 1999 and March 2005, 1270 (22.4%) patients had a baseline HbA1c value recorded. Of these 1270 patients, 215 (16.9%) had a recurrent cardiac event. Compared with the 'no recurrent event' cohort, the 'recurrent event' cohort were younger, less likely to have undergone an initial coronary artery bypass graft, and more likely to have undergone percutaneous coronary intervention with or without stent. The recurrent event cohort was also less likely to have purchased an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor ('statin') [p = 0.043] at the time of the incident cardiac event. There was no significant difference in mean baseline HbA1c value between the cohorts. There were also no significant differences between the cohorts when categorized by baseline HbA1c <7% as referent compared with > or =7% to <8%, > or =8% to <9%, > or =9 to <10%, and > or =10%. Moreover, there was no significant difference between cohorts when HbA1c values <7% were compared with values >7% in the unadjusted analysis. Results remained non-significant after adjustment for sex, incident cardiac event type, baseline age, ss-blocker use, statin use and hyperlipidaemia.", 
    "711": "The results of this study suggest that an abnormal HbA1c is not predictive of recurrent cardiac events among patients with cardiovascular disease when other cardiovascular risk factors are being aggressively treated and appropriate secondary prevention medications are being taken.

It is observed that lactoperoxidase (LPO) can effectively and selectively iodinate the tyrosyl residues in angiotensin peptides. The thiourea/thiouracil-based peroxidase inhibitors effectively inhibit the iodination reactions, indicating that iodination is an enzymatic reaction and the mechanism of iodination is similar to that of peroxidase-catalyzed iodination of thyroglobulin. This study also shows that the monoiodo Ang I is a better substrate for the angiotensin converting enzyme than the native peptide.", 
    "713": "Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) are characterized by enhanced nifedipine-sensitive component of sympathetic vasoconstriction. Our study tried to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for long-term reduction of blood pressure (BP) in SHR subjected to early transient captopril treatment. Adult untreated SHR aged 30-34 weeks were compared with animals subjected to chronic captopril treatment for 6 weeks either in youth (between 4 and 10 weeks of age) or in adulthood (between 24 and 30 weeks of age). Antihypertensive effects of captopril were more pronounced in young than adult SHR. This was due to greater attenuation of sympathetic and nifedipine-sensitive BP components and prevention of residual BP rise in young captopril-treated SHR in which the reductions of nifedipine-sensitive BP component and residual BP persisted for 20 weeks after captopril withdrawal. The magnitude of nifedipine-sensitive component of sympathetic vasoconstriction is decisive for BP maintenance not only in untreated SHR but also in SHR during active captopril treatment by or after its withdrawal.",

Other recent studies deal with omalizumab pretreatment of patients with systemic mastocytosis and very severe allergic reactions to immunotherapy. It would appear that venom immunotherapy is somewhat unique compared to inhalant allergen immunotherapy in that premedication prior to rush protocols may not be necessary and that intervals of therapy may be longer than with allergen immunotherapy. The use of concomitant medications such as beta-blockers may be indicated in special situations. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors can be stopped temporarily before venom injections to prevent reactions.

The HPA algorithm was applied to 16 quality measures from the national Hospital Quality Alliance (July 2003-June 2004) for acute myocardial infarction (AMI), heart failure (HF), and pneumonia. Top-performing hospitals were defined as those with the top 1% of HPA scores (n = 45).",

Mean performance on quality measures was higher for top hospitals on all 16 measures. For example, on administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors to patients with HF, the mean score for top-performing hospitals was 93.3%, compared with 76.5% for others (p < .001).

    "734": "To assess the role of the renin-angiotensin (RAS) and adrenergic systems in the development and progression of dilated cardiomyopathy in the Syrian cardiomyopathic hamster (SCH), echocardiographic parameters were evaluated in 6-month-old animals after 5 months of treatment with enalapril (25 mg/kg/day) plus losartan (10 mg/kg/day), or with carvedilol (1 mg/kg/day). Cardiac output indexes (COI) increased by 53% after RAS blockade and by 20% after beta-blockade in SCH. Moreover, LVEDV and LVESV decreased 30% and 62%, respectively (P < .05) during RAS blockade, whereas ejection fraction (EF) increased by 48%. By contrast, carvedilol reduced LVESV by only 28% (P < .05) and increased EF by only 15% (P < .05). These results suggest that RAS activation plays a critical role in the development of cardiac dysfunction in SCH and that suppression of RAS may be more effective than beta-blockade in retarding the development of cardiomyopathy in SCH. Owing to timing (pre-heart failure stage) and to the single dose protocol, the implications of this study for human subjects remain to be clarified.", 
    "735": "Renal artery stenosis (RAS) is usually caused by atherosclerosis or fibromuscular dysplasia. RAS leads to activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and may result in hypertension, ischemic nephropathy, left ventricular hypertrophy and congestive heart failure. Management options include medical therapy and revascularization procedures. Recent studies have shown angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) to be highly effective in treating the hypertension associated with RAS and in reducing cardiovascular events; however, they do not correct the underlying RAS and loss of renal mass may continue. Renal artery angioplasty was first performed by Gruntzig in 1978. The routine use of stents has increased technical success rates compared with angioplasty, and surgery is now only rarely performed. Although numerous case series claimed benefit in terms of blood pressure control, no adequately powered randomized, controlled, prospective study of renal artery interventions has reported their effect on cardiovascular morbidity or mortality. The CORAL trial, an ongoing study of renal artery stent placement and optimal medical therapy (OMT) funded by the National Institutes of Health, is the first study to attempt to do so. Until the CORAL trial results are in, physicians will continue to be faced with difficult choices when determining the optimal management for RAS patients and deciding which, if any, patients should be offered revascularization.",

For six samples of conventional milk-based infant formulas and three breast milk samples, no inhibition was observed. Inhibitory potential did not correlate with the degree of hydrolysis. Using reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) coupled to electrospray ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry (ESI-TOF-MS), 15 peptides known to inhibit ACE were identified. Among them, the highly potent ACE inhibitor Ile-Trp (IC 50 = 0.7 microM) was detected and quantified for the first time in the HA samples, representing the most effective ACE-inhibiting peptide that has ever been detected in food items.

    "743": "Angiotensin II (Ang II) is an important mediator stimulating liver fibrosis after liver injury. However, it is not known whether Ang II plays a role in liver regeneration. Here, we investigate the effects of Ang II type 1 (AT(1)) receptor blocker (ARB), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), systemic infusion of Ang II, and genetic deficiency of the AT(1a) receptor (AT1a-KO) on the hepatic regenerative response to partial hepatectomy (PH) in mice. Administration of ARB (candesartan cilexetil and losartan) or ACEI (enarapril and lisinopril) enhanced 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation into hepatocyte nuclei in remnant liver as well as the restoration of liver weight after PH. Systemic infusion of Ang II (100 ng/kg/min) suppressed the PH-induced BrdU incorporation and the restoration of liver weight. In contrast to Ang II infusion, these hepatic responses to PH were significantly greater in AT1a-KO mice than in wild-type mice. The PH-induced increases in hepatic levels of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) mRNA and plasma HGF concentrations were greater in candesartan- and enarapril-treated mice or in AT1a-KO mice than in vehicle-treated mice or wild-type mice, respectively, whereas they were less in Ang II-infused mice than in vehicle-infused mice. In contrast to HGF, blockades of the renin-angiotensin system or Ang II infusion produced opposite effects on the PH-induce increases in hepatic transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 1 mRNA and plasma TGF-beta 1 levels. These studies suggest that Ang II plays a role in the liver regeneration as a suppressor of hepatocyte proliferation via the AT(1) receptor-mediated control of growth factor production.",

The intervention involved all physicians in the department of cardiac surgery agreeing to complete a report on each patient before hospital discharge. The document recorded the indications for the recommended treatments, and prompted for details of the drugs prescribed, the doses used, the reasons for not prescribing the recommended drugs, if that was the case, and the use of alternative medicines. The efficacy of the intervention was evaluated by comparing the rate of drug use in the year in which it was introduced (2003, n=341) with retrospective data on the rate in the previous year (n=369). The rates of use of aspirin, statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and beta-blockers by patients who required them all showed an absolute increase, of 13.4%, 38.3%, 21.8%, and 21.5%, respectively. In conclusion, the introduction of a simple and inexpensive intervention was able to significantly increase the use of drugs for secondary prevention in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.",

It is established that the remodeling process is associated with late onset of heart failure and decreased survival. ACE inhibitor therapy reduces progressive increases in LV dimensions and significantly improves the clinical course of a broad spectrum of patients with LV dysfunction. Moreover, AA supplements prevent myocardial dysfunction caused by exercise in patients with type 2 diabetes. In addition to ACE inhibitor therapy, patients with diabetes were randomly assigned to receive AA supplements or placebo. LV function and dimensions were assessed with quantitative echocardiographic tests at intake into the study and after 6 months of follow-up. In patients with type 2 diabetes, LV end-diastolic index was reduced significantly during the 6-month period of AA consumption (89 +/- 9 mL/m2 vs 76 +/- 8 mL/m2; p <0.01), and LV ejection fraction (LVEF) improved (0.46 +/- 0.07 vs 0.52 +/- 0.05; p <0.001). No significant changes in LVEF or LV end-diastolic index occurred in the placebo group. These findings suggest that AA supplementation, together with ACE-inhibitor therapy, may have a beneficial effect on the LV remodeling process in patients with type 2 diabetes with mild-to-moderate LV dysfunction.",

In this work, the in vitro sustained release of captopril from Metolose SH 4000 SR/sodium bicarbonate floating tablets has been studied, varying the proportions of Metolose and bicarbonate. This was studied at two different compaction pressures. Other studied variables include the kinetics of the hydration volume, the matrices floating time and the matrix density. The results show that matrices compacted at 55 MPa float in the dissolution medium for more than 8h while those compacted at 165 MPa float only when sodium bicarbonate is included in the formulation. The increase of the matrix polymer proportion increases the maximal hydration volume as well as the time to attain this maximum. The matrices hydration volume increases with the inclusion of sodium bicarbonate in the formulation. The matrix density is lower when compacted at 55 MPa. The drug release constant (k) decreases and the exponent indicative of the release mechanism (n) increases with increasing polymer contents. The drug released with time is lesser when sodium bicarbonate is included in the formulation. Carbon dioxide bubbles obstruct the diffusion path and decrease the matrix coherence. The effect of compaction pressure to reduce the drug release rate has to be made clear in further studies.", 
    "747": "Ras GTPases function as transducers of extracellular signals regulating many cell functions, and they appear to be involved in the development of hypertension. In the present study, we have investigated whether antihypertensive treatment with ARBs (angiotensin II receptor blockers), ACEi (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) and diuretics induce changes in Ras activation and in some of its effectors [ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase) and Akt] in lymphocytes from patients with hypertension without or with diabetes. ACEi treatment transiently reduced Ras activation in the first month of treatment, but diuretics induced a sustained increase in Ras activation throughout the 3 months of the study. In patients with hypertension and diabetes, ARB, ACEi and diuretic treatment increased Ras activation only during the first week. ACEi treatment increased phospho-ERK expression during the first week and also in the last 2 months of the study; however, diuretic treatment reduced phospho-ERK expression during the last 2 months of the study. In patients with hypertension and diabetes, antihypertensive treatments did not induce changes in phospho-ERK expression in lymphocytes. ACEi treatment reduced phospho-Akt expression in patients with hypertension and diabetes only in the first month of treatment. In conclusion, these findings show that antihypertensive treatments with ACEi, and diuretics to a lesser extent, modify Ras activation and some of its signalling pathways, although in different directions, whereas ARBs do not appear to have any influence on Ras signalling pathways.",

The magnitude of BP lowering is crucial in both populations. In renal patients, diuretics alone or in combination with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, compared with placebo, are powerful BP-lowering and stroke-protective agents. Calcium channel blockers and ACE inhibitors also seem to be superior to placebo, but with more modest BP-decreasing effects and statistically nonsignificant reductions in stroke risk. In active versus active drug studies, independently of the BP-lowering effect, there are no significant advantages of any class over the others, although the results point to a slight superiority of diuretics and calcium channel blockers. Antihypertensive regimens in CKD patients should always include a diuretic, because, in the pathogenesis of CKD-associated hypertension, volume overload plays a crucial role. Diuretics are also inexpensive and well tolerated.",

Prostaglandin E(2) is much more abundant in the medulla than in the cortex, yet likely differences in effects between zones have not been defined. This study is focused on different vascular effects in the cortex and medulla and interaction with the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). In anaesthetized rats, the effects of cyclo-oxygenase blockade and of PGE(2) infused into the renal artery or renal interstitium were examined. Total renal blood flow was measured by ultrasonic renal artery probe, and local perfusion, separately, of the superficial cortex, outer- and inner medulla, as laser-Doppler fluxes. Indomethacin (5 mg kg(-1) i.v.) increased cortical perfusion (by approximately 10%) and decreased medullary perfusion (by approximately 20%). Renal artery infusion of PGE(2) (15-30 microg kg(-1) h(-1)) increased cortical and medullary perfusion only transiently. Previous inactivation of the RAS using losartan or captopril, and background infusion of exogenous angiotensin II, prevented the transient increase and enhanced the subsequent stable decrease in perfusion. Prostaglandin E(2) infused into the medullary interstitium (7-22 microg kg(-1) h(-1)) increased medullary perfusion by 13%, while cortical perfusion decreased by 6%. Misoprostol, an agonist of constrictor EP(3) receptors, decreased perfusion of the cortex and medulla, with both renal artery and medullary interstitial infusion. In conclusion, in rat renal cortex the dominating stable PGE(2) effect is vasoconstriction, most probably mediated by EP(3) receptors and unrelated to activation of the RAS. Prostaglandin E(2) applied to the cortical or medullary interstitium, a natural route for paracrine agents, induces medullary vasodilatation.",

FAD286/spironolactone increased cardiac output without modifying arterial pressure. Long-term FAD286 and spironolactone reduced left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic pressure, LV relaxation constant, and LV dilatation, and these effects were more marked with FAD286, whereas both drugs reduced LV hypertrophy and collagen accumulation to the same extent.

FAD286, but not long-term spironolactone, reduced the CHF-related enhancements in LV reactive oxygen species, reduced-oxidized glutathione ratio, and aortic nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase activity.

This reduction of IMT in the first group would be possibly statistically significant if the control group did not exhibit a similar reduction. The authors attributed the IMT reduction of the control group to the fact that all patients were on hypolipidaemic treatment with statins, whereas the vast majority of them were also on treatment with either beta-blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or calcium-channels antagonists.

    "775": "Diabetic nephropathy is a leading cause of renal failure requiring replacement therapy. Diabetic nephropathy is typically characterized by persistent microalbuminuria progressing to nephrotic syndrome, a progressive decline in glomerular filtration rate, and hypertension. Diabetic nephropathy prevention strategies may involve early angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor treatment and the control of diabetes to reduce glomerular hypertension and hyperfiltration. Treatment strategies include the use of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and cholesterol-lowering agents. Early intervention is key to the prevention of more severe renal outcomes. Although intensive and early control of blood pressure (BP) is key to renoprotection, the class of antihypertensive has an important bearing on outcome. There is evidence for the efficacy of ARBs in preventing the progression from microalbuminuria to overt nephropathy (urine protein excretion >500 mg/day) from the IRbesartan in patients with diabetes and MicroAlbuminuria (IRMA 2) Study using irbesartan and the INcideNt to OVert: Angiotensin II receptor blocker, Telmisartan, Investigation On type 2 diabetic Nephropathy (INNOVATION) Study using telmisartan. For the management of overt nephropathy, the findings of the Reduction of Endpoints in NIDDM with the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan (RENAAL) Study and the Irbesartan in Diabetic Nephropathy Trial (IDNT) demonstrate that losartan and irbesartan, respectively, reduce the time to doubling of serum creatinine levels and development of end-stage renal disease.", 
    "776": "Several lines of evidence show that office blood pressure (BP) reduction can substantially decrease the risk of major cardiovascular events in hypertensive patients. It is also increasingly recognized that home and 24-hour ambulatory BPs provide additional prognostic information, and there is evidence to suggest that BP lowering over the 24-hour period is crucial for optimal risk reduction. However, BP is often difficult to control, even under the near-optimal conditions of clinical trials. Ideally, antihypertensive therapy should aim to control both office and out-of-office (i.e., 24-hour) BPs, and multiple risk factors in order to provide optimal cardiovascular risk reduction. This approach usually necessitates the use of polypharmacy with an attendant increase in costs and the risk of adverse events. For these reasons, increasing attention is being devoted to drugs that exert beneficial, BP-independent effects on target-organ damage or reduce the incidence of conditions (such as diabetes and metabolic syndrome) that are associated with high cardiovascular risk. Several studies have consistently shown that the incidence of new-onset diabetes is lower with angiotensin receptor blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and calcium antagonists than \"older\" drugs such as diuretics and beta-blockers. However, long-term studies examining target-organ protection may more fully illustrate the BP-independent benefits of specific antihypertensive agents.", 
    "777": "Abdominal obesity is an important cardiovascular risk factor. It is a primary driver of the metabolic syndrome, the cluster of metabolic risk factors that includes insulin resistance and dyslipidemia, and often occurs in association with hypertension. The aim of antihypertensive therapy in patients with metabolic risk factors is to reduce cardiovascular risk, but some antihypertensive agents can exert adverse metabolic effects. For example, beta-blockers produce significant weight gain, and are associated with an increased incidence of diabetes. By contrast, agents that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), have been shown to be associated with a decreased risk of new-onset diabetes. This reflects the finding that increased activation of the RAS in obese individuals can contribute to the development of the metabolic syndrome. The ARB telmisartan has been shown to act as a selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma modulator. It is known that PPAR-gamma plays a role in the regulation of multiple genes affecting carbohydrate and lipid metabolism; however, the clinical significance of this remains to be established. The potential metabolic effects of RAS blockade should be considered in the choice of antihypertensive therapy for patients with metabolic risk factors, including obesity.", 
    "778": "Attenuation of 24-hour blood pressure (BP) fluctuation, and control of the early morning BP surge, may help to improve cardiovascular outcomes in hypertensive patients. However, studies show that early morning BP is generally poorly controlled even in patients with well-controlled clinic BP. Few antihypertensives are sufficiently long-acting to sustain adequate BP-lowering for the full 24 hours between once-daily doses, and indeed many are at their lowest efficacy during the risky early morning period. The angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) telmisartan has the longest plasma half-life, highest lipophilicity, highest receptor binding affinity, and slowest dissociation of any ARB, making it particularly suitable for sustained 24-hour BP control. In clinical studies, telmisartan provides 24-hour BP control superior to that of the ARBs losartan and valsartan, the calcium-channel blocker amlodipine, and the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor ramipril. This agent is particularly effective during the last 6 hours of the dosing interval when the other antihypertensives tend to go down in effectiveness. Telmisartan is, therefore, a highly appropriate antihypertensive for sustained 24-hour BP control, especially during the risky early morning hours.",

We evaluated and compared the echocardiographically determined systolic and left ventricular diastolic functional indices in Nigerian hypertensive patients, associated with the chronic use of ACE inhibitors, Calcium channel blockers (CCB) or their combinations. METHODS: Ejection fraction -EF, intraventricular relaxation time (IVRT), E/A peak velocity ratio, E wave deceleration time] as well as the left ventricular mass index (LVMI) was undertaken among 41 Nigerian patients with essential hypertension only, on treatment for 4-6 months prior. The 41 patients (aged 59 +/- 10 years, 40% females) were divided into three groups; those receiving (i) ACE inhibitors; or (ii) CCB or (iii) combination of ACEI and CCB. All the three groups had a background of diuretic treatment for optimal blood pressure control. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in the mean LVMI or sitting blood pressure between treatment groups. E/A ratio for ACEI treatment was 1.06 +/- 0.44, CCB 0.74 +/- 0.19, and for ACEI + CCB 0.87 +/- 0.26 (F = 3.29, P = 0.048 anova). The 95% confidence interval for the E/A ratio on ACEI was 0.8 to 1.33. The A wave duration time integral (AVVTi) were all abnormally large, but showed a significant between treatment group difference (P = 0.037, anova). The values were 21.9 +/- 4.7 for ACEI, 25.3 +/- 6.3 for CCB, and least at 20.1 +/- 3.6 cm for the ACE + CCB combination. Similarly, the IVRT was lowest and <100 ms with ACEI + CCB being 93 +/- 18 ms, ACEI 115 +/- 23 ms, and CCB being 117 +/- 22 ms (F = 4.92, P = 0.01, anova). The 95% CI for IVRT on ACEI + CCB was 82 to 104 ms. There were no between treatment group differences in systolic contractility, (fractional shortening or EF). CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that use of an antihypertensive drug regime inclusive of an ACE inhibitor (+/-CCB) may be associated with greater salutary effect on indices of diastolic function, (E/A > 1, lower AVVTi, IVRT < 100 ms) even in the presence of an equivalent effect on systolic function and blood pressure.",

    "787": "In patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), timely and adequate treatment may improve the prognosis dramatically. Restoration of the infarct vessel patency is one of the cornerstones of initial treatment. Compared with fibrinolytic therapy, primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) results in improved short- and long-term survival, a lower incidence of recurrent infarction and a better left ventricular function. Although (drug-eluting) stents may reduce restenosis, effects on mortality are less clear. Administration of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists may further reduce periprocedural coronary complications, but bivalirudin may offer similar effects with less bleeding. beta-adrenergic blockers, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and statins should be initiated in all patients with STEMI, although cautious use of beta-blockers is advised in patients at risk of cardiac shock. Patients with diabetes should receive optimal glucose control. High-risk patients, particularly those with a low ejection fraction, should receive an implantable cardioverter defibrillator after 30 days, although it is not clear whether patients who have received primary PCI also benefit, particularly if they have no signs of heart failure.", 
    "788": "The diagnosis of primary hyperaldosteronism due to microadenoma or unilateral adrenal hyperplasia can be challenging, since hypokalaemic alkalosis, high plasma aldosterone and a definite adenoma on imaging may all be absent.", 
    "789": "We describe three cases of resistant hypertension (on > or = 5 antihypertensives) where hyperaldosteronism was suspected because of a suppressed plasma renin level despite treatment with multiple drugs which normally elevate renin. Renin mass was measured by a double-site chemi-immunoluminometric assay. All patients had normal plasma aldosterone levels. Hypokalaemia was present in the first two cases but computed tomography did not show clear cut adenomas. Adrenal vein sampling (AVS) revealed lateralisation (> 4 times higher aldosterone to cortisol ratio (ACR) on the affected than contra-lateral side). The third patient was normokalaemic and AVS showed only minimal lateralisation (ACR 1.3:1). The severe hypertension in all cases was reversed by adrenalectomy, with blood pressure falling to target despite withdrawal of all but one to two drugs.", 
    "790": "The robotic assay of renin mass permits rapid detection of patients in whom plasma renin is suppressed below the normal range. A suppressed plasma renin indicates abnormal Na+-retention, and--when not overcome by drugs such as angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers--may be the only clue to a curable adrenal adenoma. AVS is required to demonstrate lateralisation of aldosterone secretion, justifying adrenalectomy.", 
    "791": "Recent evidence suggests a coordinated regulation by the local renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and tissue kallikrein-kinin system (TKKS) of blood flow and substrate supply in oxidative red myofibres of skeletal muscle tissue during endurance exercise. The performance of these myofibres is dependent on the increased oxidation of substrates facilitated by augmenting nutritive blood flow and glucose uptake. Humoral factors released by the contracting fibres, such as adenosine and kinins, are suggested to be responsible for this metabolic adjustment. The considerable drain of blood volume and the enormous consumption of glucose during endurance exercise require a control mechanism for the maintenance of blood pressure (BP) and glucose homeostasis. This is achieved by the sympathetic nervous system and its subordinate RAS, which is located in the nutritive vessels and parenchyma of the red myofibres. The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is the primary enzyme responsible for kinin degradation during exercise, underscoring the important interrelationship between the RAS and the TKKS in the critical role of kinins in the multifactorial regulation of muscle bioenergetics and glucose and BP homeostasis. Importantly, overactivity of the ACE, as occurs in individuals displaying risk factors such as overweight, causes exaggerated BP response and reduced glucose disposal. If they persist over years, compensatory responses to this ACE overactivity, such as hypersecretion of insulin and compliance of the vessel walls, will inevitably be exhausted, leading ultimately to the manifestation of type 2 diabetes and hypertension. This concept also provides a unifying explanation for the beneficial effects of ACE-inhibitors and Angiotensin II receptor antagonists in the treatment of hypertension and insulin resistance.",

In the former 3 groups, pulmonary fibrosis was induced via intratracheal injection of bleomycin A5 (5 mg/kg), after which the rats in the perindopril and losartan groups received intragastric administration of the corresponding agents at the daily dose of 2 mg/kg and 10 m/kg, respectively. The rats in the control group had intratracheal injection of normal saline only. In the 4th week, the histological changes of the lung tissues were examined microscopically with Masson staining. Hydroxyproline content in the lungs was measured, and the protein expressions of AT-1 receptor, TGF-beta1 and IkappaBalpha were examined using Western blotting. DNA binding activity of NF-kappaB was analyzed with electrophoretic gel mobility shift assay (EMSA), and zymography was used to assess the activity of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and 9 (MMP-2, 9).",

Two months later, the rabbits were either left untreated (MI group) or were treated daily for one month with 0.1 mg/kg wt of ramipril (ramipril group), then sacrificed. One month of ramipril treatment resulted in a significant improvement in the LV ejection fraction (LVEF) and a decrease in hydroxyproline content. The protein profiles of LV tissue showed that ramipril caused upregulation of glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and heart-type fatty acid binding-protein (h-FABP) and downregulation of HSP27 and cyclophilin A. Ramipril treatment caused an increase in catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and SOD activity in the LV tissue. Oxidized glutathione levels and the GSSG/GSH ratio in the heart tissue were lower in the ramipril group than in the MI group.",

Prevalence of diabetic retinopathy was 3.7-fold lower in MIDD patients (6/74, 8 vs 40/134, 29.6%, p < 0.0001). Differences between groups remained significant after adjustment for hypertension, systolic blood pressure and HbA(1c). In MIDD, urinary albumin excretion (314.8 vs 80.1 mg/24 h, p = 0.035) and creatinine plasma levels (103.5 vs 82.2 micromol/l, p = 0.0178) were higher and GFR was lower. Impaired renal function (GFR <60 ml/min) was four- to sixfold more frequent in MIDD. Differences between MIDD and control diabetic patients further increased when adjusted for HbA(1c) and systolic blood pressure (p < 0.0001). Adjustment for treatment with an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor antagonist did not modify the results.",

The aforementioned changes have its implications on clinical presentations, management and prognosis of all renal diseases in elderly. Atypical presentation, more frequent and longer course are the characteristics of acute renal failure in this age group.

Recent data from mouse models of Marfan's syndrome suggest that aortic-root enlargement is caused by excessive signaling by transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) that can be mitigated by treatment with TGF-beta antagonists, including angiotensin II-receptor blockers (ARBs). We evaluated the clinical response to ARBs in pediatric patients with Marfan's syndrome who had severe aortic-root enlargement.",

    "808": "Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is an inherited systemic disease characterized by a prolonged subclinical course of gradual renal cyst expansion, resulting in massively enlarged kidneys and renal failure by the fifth to sixth decade. Renal cyst expansion results in intrarenal ischemia and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and relates to the development and maintenance of hypertension in ADPKD. Hypertension relates to disease progression in ADPKD with regard to renal volume, proteinuria, cardiovascular complications, and progression to end-stage renal disease. Novel magnetic resonance imaging methods developed in the Consortium for Radiologic Imaging for the Study of Polycystic Kidney Disease (CRISP) provide accurate estimates of change in renal volume over a short period of time in ADPKD patients with intact renal function. In CRISP an increase in renal volume of 63.4 ml/yr was found. PKD1 status, male gender, hypertension, reduced renal blood flow, and proteinuria are associated with increased renal volume and change in renal volume over time. HALT-Polycystic Kidney Disease (HALT-PKD) is designed to test whether blockade of RAAS and/or rigorous blood pressure control play a role in slowing renal progression during early (using magnetic resonance imaging methods developed in CRISP) and during late (using measures, including composite of time to doubling of serum creatinine, onset of end-stage renal disease, or death) phases in ADPKD. Findings from CRISP and the rationale for interventions in ADPKD are described, and the design of the HALT-PKD clinical trial is outlined.",

Oral prednisone with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, was initiated because of active lesions of tubulitis, and led to the complete regression of bone pains, and by the improvement of renal function and regression of the features of proximal tubulopathy. Thus, in the presence of vitamin deficiencies in a patient with SSc, together with a search for malabsorption syndrome secondary to bacterial overgrowth, CD and/or PBC-associated Fanconi syndrome should be investigated.",

Participants were 2,111 subjects (67% women; aged 47-95 years) who were undergoing biennial health examinations from 1994 to 2000. The subjects were examined for the effect of certain drugs on bone mineral change during baseline and one follow-up (4 year later) measurements. Mean annual percentage change in BMD at the femoral neck was -0.38% for men, and -1.14% for women. After adjustment for sex, age, change of weight, alcohol consumption, and smoking status, annual percentage change in BMD decreased by 0.61% among individuals taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors continuously in comparison with individuals who had not taken them (p = 0.002): also decreased 0.40% among individuals taking benzodiazepines (BZDs) continuously (p = 0.034).

After a median follow up of 56 months, no significant differences were observed between the three groups neither in the primary composite outcome (death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction, stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure), nor in each of its components, total mortality and other secondary outcomes. Telmisartan was equivalent to ramipril (non inferiority criterion), but was better tolerated (less cough and angioedema). The combination of the two drugs in this population (without congestive heart failure and proteinuric nephropathy) did not bring increased benefit (no superiority), but was associated with more adverse events (hypotension, syncope and renal dysfunction). In this population, the choice of the molecule in monotherapy remains optional and the use of a dual blockade is not justified in order to have a better cardiovascular protection.",

Such blockade can be obtained with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, a specific antagonist of angiotensin II AT1 receptors and/or recently a direct inhibitor of renin such as aliskiren. Various studies have demonstrated the advantage of optimising RAAS blockade in order to benefit of the best cardiorenal protection. The present article describes the various modalities to optimize the RAAS blockade, either by using a maximal dosage of a monotherapy, or by choosing a double inhibition of RAAS.

The EFFECT Registry, which prospectively enrolled 9,943 patients admitted to the hospital for HF from 1999 to 2001 in 103 hospitals in Ontario, Canada, was used. Patients discharged alive were divided into those with EF >50% and EF <50%. Discharge medications (angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors, beta blockers [BBs], spironolactone, and digoxin) were examined for their association with HF rehospitalization or death during 1 year. In the HF group with EF >50% (n = 1,026), 199 patients died within 1 year and 349 patients died or were hospitalized for HF within 1 year. In the HF group with EF <50% (n = 1,898), 427 patients died and 720 patients died or were hospitalized for HF. In the HF group with EF >50%, 67% were administered an ACE inhibitor; 32%, a BB; 37%, digoxin; and 12%, spironolactone.

    "828": "Concerns have been raised regarding a possible link between the increasing utilization of RAAS blocking strategies in the United States and the increasing ESRD epidemic. Most reports of accelerated renal failure in CKD patients with renal artery stenosis on RAAS blockade are retrospective. We hypothesized that this syndrome is therefore poorly understood, may be under-recognized, and demanded prospective analysis. As part of a larger cohort of 100 CKD patients on RAAS blockade presenting with worsening renal failure (>25% increased serum creatinine from baseline) while concurrently on an ACE inhibitor and/or an angiotensin receptor blocker, 26 patients (26%) enrolled between September 2002 and February 2005 had hemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis. RAAS blockade was discontinued, standard nephrology care applied, and eGFR by MDRD monitored. They consisted of 26 Caucasian patients, M:F = 10:16, age 75.3 +/- 6.4 (63-87) years. Mean follow-up was 26.4 +/- 16.4 (1-49) months. Duration of RAAS blockade prior to enrollment was 20.2 +/- 16.4 (0.5-48) months. Contrary to previous reports, precipitating factors were often absent (15/26), unilateral RAS lesions in patients with dual kidneys was common (19/26), and progression to ESRD was frequent (5/26). Four-fifths of the ESRD patients were dead after 5.5 +/- 4.1 (1-11) months. A fifth patient with improved eGFR died after 14 months from metastatic gastric cancer. Excluding five patients who progressed to ESRD and two patients lost early to follow-up, in 19 patients, eGFR increased from 27.8 +/- 9.5 (11-47) to 36.7 +/- 16 (14-68) mL/min/1.73 m(2) BSA (p = 0.014) after 34.8 +/- 10.1 (14-49) months of follow-up. This improvement in eGFR was evident after weeks to months of stopping RAAS blockade in these patients with and without renal PTA and stenting. Nevertheless, renal PTA/stenting further improved eGFR in selected patients. We conclude that renal failure/ESRD associated with concurrent RAAS blockade in older CKD patients with renal stenosis remains poorly understood and mostly unrecognized. Unilateral lesions in patients with dual kidneys, absent precipitating factors, and progression to ESRD with high mortality, despite discontinuation of RAAS blockade, are more common than previously thought. Lower baseline eGFR (<35) predicted ESRD. Our findings call for a larger prospective study, especially given growing concerns of iatrogenic renal failure from RAAS blockade in the aging U.S. population. An aging U.S. population further raises the probability of the presence of increasing and unrecognized renal artery stenosis in our CKD patient population.",

The endothelial dysfunction was assessed using FMD (flow-mediated vasodilation) of the brachial arteries. The baseline characteristics of both groups were similar in age, gender, left venticular ejection fraction, left ventricular mass index, and body mass index. No significant difference was also found between the groups in the distribution of atherosclerotic risk factors as well as other echocardiographic, demographic, and biochemical measurements. Although the reduction of diastolic blood pressure was more pronounced in the nebivolol group after a 4-week treatment, the change in the systolic blood pressure was found to be similar in both treatment arms. Although a statistically nonsignificant increase was observed in flow-mediated vasodilation in the quinapril group (4.77% +/- 3.92%, 5.60% +/- 6.18%; p = .587), the increase in the post-treatment FMD was statistically significant in the nebivolol group (3.78% +/- 4.25%, 8.56% +/- 6.39%; p = .002).

    "831": "After 9 months, PP had fallen by 9.1+/-0.2 mmHg (p<0.001). Multivariate analysis of the determinants of PP reduction showed a significant positive association with administration of fixed ACEI/diuretic combination (p<0.001) and a negative association with glycated hemoglobin (p<0.01). During the 9 months follow-up, 632 CV events occurred. In multivariate analysis, the administration of fixed perindopril/indapamide combination was associated with a lower incidence of CV events (OR = 0.64 [0.48-0.86], p<0.01), independently of CV risk factors.", 
    "832": "The reinforcement of therapeutic measures made possible the reduction of PP in type 2 diabetic hypertensives, under conditions of usual care. Administration of a fixed perindopril/indapamide combination therapy was associated with an independent reduction of CV events.", 
    "833": "Avoiding Cardiovascular events through COMbination therapy in Patients LIving with Systolic Hypertension (ACCOMPLISH) is an outcome study investigating aggressive antihypertensive combination treatment. It has achieved a larger fraction of overall patients with blood pressure (BP) <140/90 mmHg (73.3%) and diabetic patients <130/80 mmHg (43.3%) at 12 months of follow-up than any other large outcomes trial. We have analyzed baseline predictors of BPs and BP control at 12 months.",

The main baseline predictors of achieving BP control were region (USA), Caucasian race and taking lipid-lowering drugs. The predictors of uncontrolled BP were higher baseline systolic BP values, more previous antihypertensive medications, proteinuria and previous thiazide use.", 
    "836": "Patients in the USA, Caucasians and patients taking lipid-lowering therapy were most likely to reach BP targets with combination therapy. Strong predictors of uncontrolled hypertension were more severe hypertension, an established need for more antihypertensive drugs and target organ damage.", 
    "837": "The coexistence of hypertension and type 2 diabetes considerably increases the risk for cardiovascular and renal complications, not only after manifestation of the diseases, but also in the range of high-normal blood pressures and prediabetic states. According to recent guidelines, patients with type 2 diabetes should be treated if the blood pressure is in the high-normal (previously normal) range (130-139/85-90 mmHg), sometimes even with blood pressures in the normal oder low prehypertensive range (120-129/80-85 mmHg). In any case, blood pressure should be reduced < 130/80 mmHg, if tolerated < 125/75 mmHg. The target for diabetic patients with microalbuminuria or nephropathy is below 125/75 mmHg. All blood pressure goals cited refer to office or clinic blood pressure measurements. The corresponding values for home (self) or ambulatory blood pressure measurement during the day are lower by 5-10 mmHg for systolic and 5 mmHg for diastolic blood pressures. The proper management of patients with type 2 diabetes has to be multifactorial, aiming at controlling blood pressure, hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia by using both lifestyle changes (reduction of sodium and fat intake, regular physical activity, weight loss in overweight patients, smoking cessation) and drug therapy. Antihypertensive treatment should be started with a (fixed) combination, preferably containing an inhibitor of the renin-angiotensin system such as ACE inhibitors or AT(1)-receptor blockers and either a diuretic (preferably indapamide) or a calciumantagonist rather than combining thiazide diuretics and beta-blockers.",

The treated group patients were younger (56.9 +/- 16.6 versus 62.3 +/- 17.8 years, P < 0.01) and more likely to have a history of hypertension than the untreated group. At the initiation of PD, systolic and diastolic blood pressures were higher in the treated than the untreated group (138.8 +/- 21.8 versus 128.6 +/- 22.4 mmHg, P < 0.001; 79.8 +/- 14.1 versus 74.5 +/- 12.5 mmHg, P = 0.001) and remained significantly higher during the follow-up (133.5 +/- 16.4 versus 125.1 +/- 16.7 mmHg; 77.3 +/- 9.8 versus 73.2 +/- 9.7 mmHg, both P < 0.001). The treated group had a significantly longer survival compared to the untreated group (log rank 19.191, P < 0.001). After adjusting for age, blood pressure and other demographic and clinical parameters, multivariable Cox proportional hazards modelling showed that the use of ACE inhibitor/ARB was associated with 62% reduced risk for death (HR 0.382, 95% CI 0.232-0.631, P < 0.001).",

Treatment with ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor antagonists (blockers) has been shown to reduce proteinuria after kidney transplantation, as well as improve both graft and patient survival. An increase in proteinuria has been observed in some patients after initiation of sirolimus therapy. Although the mechanism of this remains unclear, high proteinuria at baseline and poor renal function at baseline have been identified as potential risk factors for the development of proteinuria after conversion to sirolimus. Initiation of sirolimus therapy is not recommended in patients with early histological indicators of glomerular damage; however, in patients with healthy grafts, sirolimus may prevent future glomerulosclerosis. Early treatment with an ACE inhibitor and sirolimus, prior to the appearance of glomerular changes, may result in better outcomes.",

Clinic blood pressure (BP) and a 24-h electrocardiogram (ECG) were evaluated monthly. Patients were asked to report any episode of symptomatic AF and to perform an ECG as early as possible. PWD and serum PIP levels were evaluated before and after each treatment period.", 
    "845": "SBP and DBP were significantly reduced by the three treatments (P < 0.001). A total of 46 (47.4%) patients treated with amlodipine had a recurrence of AF as did 26 (27.9%) patients treated with ramipril (P < 0.01 vs. amlodipine) and 16 (16.1%) patients treated with valsartan (P < 0.01 vs. amlodipine and P < 0.05 vs. ramipril). The Kaplan-Meyer analysis showed a significant reduction of AF episodes in the valsartan group (P = 0.005 log-rank test) as well as in the ramipril group (P = 0.021), even if at a lesser degree. PWD values were significantly reduced by ramipril (-4.2 ms, P < 0.05) and even more by valsartan (-11.2 ms, P < 0.01), the difference being significant (P < 0.01). Serum PIP levels were reduced by ramipril (-49.7 microg, P < 0.001) and valsartan (-49.3 microg, P < 0.001).", 
    "846": "Despite similar BP lowering, valsartan and ramipril were more effective than amlodipine in preventing new episodes of AF, but the effect of valsartan was greater than that of ramipril. This could be related to the greater PWD reduction observed with valsartan.", 
    "847": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition reduces heart disease and vascular stiffness in hypertension and leads to kinin accumulation. In this study, we analysed the role and importance of two kinin receptor subtypes in angiogenesis during ACE inhibition in an in vitro model of angiogenesis of the mouse heart.",

Bradykinin induced dose-dependent endothelial sprout formation in vitro in adult mouse heart only under hypoxia (1.7 fold, n = 6, P < 0.05). The B2 receptor mediated sprouting that was induced by bradykinin and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF(164); n = 6, P < 0.05), but did not mediate sprouting that was induced by growth factors bFGF or PDGF-BB. Enalapril induced sprouting through both the B1 and B2 kinin receptors, but it required the presence of the B2 receptor in both scenarios and was dependent on BK synthesis. B1-receptor agonists induced sprout formation via the B1 receptor (2.5 fold, n = 6, P < 0.05), but it required the presence of the B2 receptor for them to do so. Both B2-receptor and B1-receptor agonist-induced angiogenesis required nitric oxide biosynthesis.",

Secondary outcomes were similar in the two groups, including death from any cause (32% in the rhythm-control group and 33% in the rate-control group), stroke (3% and 4%, respectively), worsening heart failure (28% and 31%), and the composite of death from cardiovascular causes, stroke, or worsening heart failure (43% and 46%).

Treating ZDF rats with AVE7688 improved vascular relaxation to acetylcholine and calcitonin gene-related peptide in epineurial arterioles. Motor and sensory nerve conduction velocity, endoneurial blood flow and thermal nociception end-points were also improved by treatment compared with untreated ZDF rats. Superoxide and expression of NEP were increased in epineurial arterioles from ZDF rats and attenuated by treatment with AVE7688.",

    "862": "The aim of this study was to assess whether the association between angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor use and the incidence of treated diabetes mellitus is modified by genetic polymorphisms in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS).In a nested case-control study, treated hypertensive patients were genotyped for ACE (insertion (I)/deletion (D)), angiotensinogen (AGT; M235T) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AGTR1; A1166C). Cases of newly treated diabetes were identified based on pharmacy records and controls were not yet drug treated for diabetes (case:control ratio 1:10). Self-administered questionnaires and physical examinations were used to assess risk factors for diabetes mellitus. Logistic regression was used to calculate the relative risk of diabetes associated with ACE inhibitor use relative to other antihypertensive treatment, stratified by the RAS genotypes. Among 205 cases and 2050 controls, homozygous 1166A carriers of the AGTR1 gene had a significantly decreased incidence of diabetes associated with current use of ACE inhibitors (odds ratio, OR: 0.47; 95% CI: 0.26-0.84), whereas this incidence was increased among 1166C allele carriers (OR: 1.32; 95% CI: 0.81-2.14). The interaction OR was 3.21 (95% CI: 1.53-6.75). ACE I allele carriers had a significantly reduced incidence of diabetes associated with ACE inhibitors use (OR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.41-0.98), whereas DD homozygotes had no reduced risk (OR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.46-1.96). The risk of diabetes associated with ACE inhibitor use was not significantly modified by the AGT-M235T polymorphism. Treatment with ACE inhibitors in hypertensive subjects significantly reduces the occurrence of diabetes in homozygous 1166A carriers of the AGTR1 gene and carriers of the ACE I allele, but not in 1166C allele carriers of the AGTR1 gene and in homozygous ACE D allele carriers.", 
    "863": "The Heart Outcomes Prevention Study (HOPE) demonstrated that ramipril resulted in a blood-pressure-independent 25% reduction in cardiovascular events in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Despite this, general practitioners and vascular surgeons remain reluctant to prescribe ACE inhibitors in this group of patients because of concerns about renal artery stenosis (RAS). We aimed to define the effect of ramipril on renal function in patients with intermittent claudication (IC).", 
    "864": "Of 132 unselected patients with IC entering the study 78 (59%) were excluded due to: current ACE inhibitor use (38%), renal impairment (serum creatinine above normal range) (15%), known severe RAS (1%) or unwillingness to participate (5%). The remaining 54 patients were titrated to 10 mg ramipril and renal function was monitored at 1, 5, and 12 weeks. Treatment was discontinued during titration in 5 patients due to symptoms (3) or lack of compliance (2). In the remainder, median [IQR] serum creatinine increased (94 [85.8-103.3] to 98 [88.0-106.5] micromol/L, p < or = 0.001) and median [IQR] GFR decreased (71.5 [64.6-82.3] to 68.7 [59.8-74.7] mL/min per 1.73 m2, p < or = 0.001) between baseline and 5 weeks. These changes were not considered clinically significant. By 12 weeks these values had returned almost to baseline (Cr 95.5 [88.0-103.25] micromol/L, GFR 71.8 [65.3-77.4] mL/min). No patient had a serum creatinine rise > 30%.",

The primary objective of the study was to compare in patients with and without MS the rate of BP control defined as a systolic BP < or = 140 mmHg and a diastolic BP < or = 90 mmHg. Patients were prospectively included and the follow-up lasted 6 months. The study population consisted of 24,069 hypertensive patients (56% men; mean age 62 +/- 11 years; 18% diabetics; mean BP at inclusion 162 +/- 13/93 +/- 9 mmHg). MS was found in 30.4% of the patients (n = 7322): 35.2% women and 20.1% men. Three therapeutic subgroups were constituted: Group A, previously untreated, received the combination therapy as initial treatment; Group B, previously treated but with unsatisfactory results and/or treatment intolerance, had its previous treatment switched to perindopril/indapamide; and Group C, previously treated, with good treatment tolerance but uncontrolled BP, received the study treatment in adjunction to the previous one. The normalization rate was 70.3% in group A, 68.4% in Group B, and 64.1% in Group C (p < 0.0001). The pre-existence of MS did not show any significant influence on these rates since BP lowering was -22.7 +/- 13.7 (SBP) and -12.0 +/- 10.0 mmHg (DBP) in patients without MS and 22.6 +/- 13.3 (SBP) and -12.1 +/- 9.7 (DBP) in those with MS. The results of this study show a significant effect of perindopril/indapamide treatment on systolic BP lowering, whatever the treatment status: initiation, switch, or adjunctive therapy, and independently from the presence or not of MS. This effect may be related to the specific vascular effect of the perindopril/indapamide combination, which has recently demonstrated in the ADVANCE trial its ability to reduce mortality, and cardiovascular and renal complications in diabetic patients.", 
    "867": "Pharmacological interruption of the renin-angiotensin system focuses on optimization of blockade. As a measure of intrarenal renin activity, we have examined renal plasma flow (RPF) responses in a standardized protocol. Compared with responses with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (rise in RPF approximately 95 mL x min(-1) x 1.73 m(-2)), greater renal vasodilation with angiotensin receptor blockers (approximately 145 mL x min(-1) x 1.73 m(-2)) suggested more effective blockade. We predicted that blockade with the direct oral renin inhibitor aliskiren would produce renal vascular responses exceeding those induced by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers.", 
    "868": "Twenty healthy normotensive subjects were studied on a low-sodium (10 mmol/d) diet, receiving separate escalating doses of aliskiren. Six additional subjects received captopril 25 mg as a low-sodium comparison and also received aliskiren on a high-sodium (200 mmol/d) diet. RPF was measured by clearance of para-aminohippurate. Aliskiren induced a remarkable dose-related renal vasodilation in low-sodium balance. The RPF response was maximal at the 600-mg dose (197+/-27 mL x min(-1) x 1.73 m(-2)) and exceeded responses to captopril (92+/-20 mL x min(-1) x 1.73 m(-2); P<0.01). Furthermore, significant residual vasodilation was observed 48 hours after each dose (P<0.01). The RPF response on a high-sodium diet was also higher than expected (47+/-17 mL x min(-1) x 1.73 m(-2)). Plasma renin activity and angiotensin levels were reduced in a dose-related manner. As another functional index of the effect of aliskiren, we found significant natriuresis on both diets.", 
    "869": "Renal vasodilation in healthy people with the potent renin inhibitor aliskiren exceeded responses seen previously with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers. The effects were longer lasting and were associated with significant natriuresis. These results indicate that aliskiren may provide more complete and thus more effective blockade of the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "870": "The reporting of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) is the mainstay of post-marketing surveillance systems. Under-reporting and selective reporting are considered the main limitations of a spontaneous reporting-based pharmacovigilance system. However, excessive reporting induced by external events may also impair signal detection by increasing the noise level.", 
    "871": "The aim of this study was to examine the influence of regulatory measures and other external factors on the rate of ADR reporting in Italy, focusing on four situations occurring in the last 10 years: ACE inhibitor-induced cough; HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors ('statins') and rhabdomyolysis; nimesulide and hepatic toxicity; and cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2 selective inhibitors ('coxibs') and increase in cardiovascular risk.", 
    "872": "The study was based on data from spontaneous reporting in six Italian regions collected from January 1995 to December 2005. We analysed a 10-year period as a reasonable time interval around the four situations of interest, highlighting the influence of regulatory measures on the rate of ADR reporting (number of reports per million inhabitants). Chi-squared tests were used to assess the statistical significance of any changes in ADR reporting. Drug sales data were also studied to examine possible changes in drug use. Sales data were expressed as daily defined dose per 1000 inhabitants per day.", 
    "873": "ACE inhibitors: a 5-fold increase in the reporting rate of ACE inhibitor-induced cough was observed in 1998 and 1999 following a restriction on reimbursement for angiotensin receptor blockers introduced in 1998 and removed at the end of 1999. Statins: after the withdrawal of cerivastatin in 2001, the ADR reporting rate increased more than 4-fold, with musculoskeletal ADRs representing about 60% of all the ADRs reported in that year, and progressively decreased in the following years. Nimesulide: an increase in hepatic ADR reporting was observed after withdrawal of the drug from the Finnish and Spanish markets in 2002. Coxibs: no important changes in the rate of cardiovascular events reporting in the period 2000-4 were observed. In 2005, after the withdrawal of rofecoxib in September 2004, both the ADR reporting rate and sales of the drug decreased drastically.", 
    "874": "Our data suggest that spontaneous ADR reporting can be influenced in different ways by external events. Our data emphasize the need for educational initiatives aimed at increasing the doctor's and patient's awareness of the usefulness and the limitations of spontaneous reporting in the pharmacovigilance system. Such initiatives should use appropriate risk communication strategies in order to avoid unnecessary alarm, which could cause unjustified interruption of therapies or misplaced confidence in new drugs.", 
    "875": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is a key regulator of vascular resistance, sodium and water homeostasis and the response to tissue injury. Historically, angiotensin II (Ang II) was thought to be the primary effector peptide of this system. Ang II is produced predominantly by the effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) on angiotensin I (Ang I). Ang II acts mainly through the angiotensin II type-1 receptor (AT(1)) and, together with ACE, these components represent the 'classical' axis of the RAS. Drug therapies targeting the RAS by inhibiting Ang II formation (ACE inhibitors) or binding to its receptor (angiotensin receptor blockers) are now in widespread clinical use and have been shown to reduce tissue injury and fibrosis in cardiac and renal disease independently of their effects on blood pressure. In 2000, two groups using different methodologies identified a homolog of ACE, called ACE2, which cleaves Ang II to form the biologically active heptapeptide, Ang-(1-7). Conceptually, ACE2, Ang-(1-7), and its putative receptor, the mas receptor represent an 'alternative' axis of the RAS capable of opposing the often deleterious actions of Ang II. Interestingly, ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers increase Ang-(1-7) production and it has been proposed that some of the beneficial effects of these drugs are mediated through upregulation of Ang-(1-7) rather than inhibition of Ang II production or receptor binding. The present review focuses on the novel components and pathways of the RAS with particular reference to their potential contribution towards the pathophysiology of liver disease.", 
    "876": "Angioedema is a frequent disorder with multiple aetiologies. Angioedemas associated with urticaria are usually caused by histamine release and respond to anti-histamines and adrenalin. They include allergic angioedemas, anaphylactoid reactions (mostly drug-induced, e.g. NSAID), physical angioedemas and recurrent idiopathic angioedema. Bradykinin probably plays a causative role in the pathogenesis of ACE-inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker related angioedemas, as well as in the pathogenesis of the rare hereditary or acquired C1-inhibitor deficiency angioedemas. Urticaria is then typically absent and anti-histamines, as well as adrenalin, are ineffective.", 
    "877": "The inflation of an intravascular balloon positioned at the superior vena cava and right atrial junction (SVC-RAJ) reduces sodium or water intake induced by various experimental procedures (e.g. sodium depletion; hypovolaemia). In the present study we investigated if the stretch induced by a balloon at this site inhibits a rapid onset salt appetite, and if this procedure modifies the pattern of immunohistochemical labelling for Fos protein (Fos-ir) in the brain. Male Sprague-Dawley rats with SVC-RAJ balloons received a combined treatment of furosemide (Furo; 10 mg (kg bw)(-1)) plus a low dose of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (Cap; 5 mg (kg bw)(-1)). Balloon inflation greatly decreased the intake of 0.3 m NaCl for as long as the balloon was inflated. Balloon inflation over a 3 h period following Furo-Cap treatment decreased Fos-ir in the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis and the subfornical organ and increased Fos-ir in the lateral parabrachial nucleus and caudal ventrolateral medulla. The effect of balloon inflation was specific for sodium intake because it did not affect the drinking of diluted sweetened condensed milk. Balloon inflation and deflation also did not acutely change mean arterial pressure. These results suggest that activity in forebrain circumventricular organs and in hindbrain putative body fluid/cardiovascular regulatory regions is affected by loading low pressure mechanoreceptors at the SVC-RAJ, a manipulation that also attenuates salt appetite.", 
    "878": "Glucose-fed rat is a model of insulin resistance that displays sensory polyneuropathy and hypertension. This study aimed at comparing the beneficial effects of N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC, antioxidant) and ramipril (angiotensin-1 converting enzyme inhibitor) on tactile and cold allodynia induced by chronic glucose feeding. Impact of these treatments was also assessed on hypertension, plasma glucose and insulin concentrations, insulin resistance and kinin B(1) receptor expression. Male Wistar rats (50-75 g) were given 10% d-glucose in their drinking water for 11 weeks or tap water (controls). Glucose-fed rats were treated either with NAC (1 g/kg/day, gavage), ramipril (1 mg/kg/day in drinking water) or no drug during the last 5 weeks. Glucose feeding for 6 weeks induced a significant increase in systolic blood pressure and hyperglycaemia which was accompanied by tactile and cold allodynia. At 11 weeks, plasma insulin, insulin resistance (HOMA index), kinin B(1) receptor mRNA in spinal cord and renal cortex and B(1) receptor binding sites in spinal cord were enhanced in glucose-fed rats. NAC and ramipril caused a progressive to complete inhibition of tactile and cold allodynia from 6 to 11 weeks. High systolic blood pressure, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance and kinin B(1) receptor expression were also normalized or attenuated in glucose-fed rats by either treatment. Results suggest that chronic treatment with an antioxidant or an ACE inhibitor provides similar beneficial effects on sensory polyneuropathy, hypertension and insulin resistance in glucose-fed rats. Both therapies were associated with a reduction of the expression of the pro-nociceptive kinin B(1) receptor.",

Reduced consumption of saturated fat (196 [55%] vs 168 [40%]; 17.3%, 6.4 to 28.2, p=0.009), and increased consumption of fruit and vegetables (680 [72%] vs 349 [35%]; 37.3%, 18.1 to 56.5, p=0.004), and oily fish (156 [17%] vs 81 [8%]; 8.9%, 0.3 to 17.5, p=0.04) at 1 year were greatest in the INT group. High-risk individuals and partners showed changes only for fruit and vegetables (p=0.005). Blood-pressure target of less than 140/90 mm Hg was attained by both coronary (615 [65%] vs 547 [55%]; 10.4%, 0.6 to 20.2, p=0.04) and high-risk (586 [58%] vs 407 [41%]; 16.9%, 2.0 to 31.8, p=0.03) patients in the INT groups. Achievement of total cholesterol of less than 5 mmol/L did not differ between groups, but in high-risk patients the difference in change from baseline to 1 year was 12.7% (2.4 to 23.0, p=0.02) in favour of INT.

Vascular abnormalities such as fingertip ulcers and Raynaud's syndrome as well as involvement of organs including the lungs, heart, kidney and the gastrointestinal tract are prominent features of the disease. There are currently no disease modifying drugs available that can modify the course of the disease. In this review we will discuss medications that have been found to be effective in improving specific organ involvement due to SSc. For the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), proton pump inhibitors are effective agents. In the setting of clinically significant gastrointestinal dysmotility, metoclopramide, erythromycin and octreotide may be beneficial. Small bowel bacterial overgrowth should be treated with oral antibiotics. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are the first-line agents for acute renal crisis. A variety of treatment options are available for Raynaud's phenomenon and include calcium channel blockers, iloprost (i. v.), losartan, fluoxetine and sildenafil. Fingertip ulcers can be prevented by using the endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan. The therapeutic options for treatment of pulmonary hypertension associated with SSc include bosentan, sildenafil and various prostacyclin analogs (eg, epoprostenol, treprostinil, iloprost). Sitaxentan, ambrisentan and new phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors could be new options for therapy as well. Therapeutic options for interstitial lung fibrosis include cyclophosphamide, however, clinical effects are mild to moderate. Methotrexate has been used to treat skin fibrosis and can be beneficial when arthritis is present.",

Hyperactivation of the endothelin system has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various cardiovascular disorders including myocardial infarction, restenosis, hypertension, heart failure and Chagas cardiopathy. Various attempts have been made to suppress this axis. Although promising, the results of clinical trials on endothelin receptor antagonists have been disappointing. There is growing interest in blockade of endothelin formation. Several selective and non-selective endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE) inhibitors have been developed, the latter with the possibility of simultaneously blocking angiotensin-converting enzyme and neutral endopeptidase, combining inhibition more than one axis. This article reviews the different ECE inhibitors, with particular emphasis on their potential clinical application in cardiovascular diseases.",

After renal transplantation, the patient developed persistent high blood pressure, despite optimal medical therapy. When angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy was begun, he developed acute anuric renal failure, which was reversed after interruption of the ACE inhibitor. After the initial clinical evaluation, the patient was referred for renal angiography, which revealed critical stenosis of the proximal left common iliac artery, just above the renal graft artery anastomosis. The patient underwent successful angioplasty and stenting of the lesion, with complete normalization of blood pressure.",

The patients were followed up for 3 years. Primary endpoint was to prevent or delay the progression to manifest hypertension. Secondary endpoints were reduction in the incidence of cerebrovascular and cardiovascular events, as well as the development of hypertension as defined by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring.",

Ramipril also proved to be more effective in reducing the incidence of manifest office hypertension in patients with baseline ambulatory blood pressure monitoring high-normal blood pressure. The incidence of cerebrovascular and cardiovascular events showed no statistically significant differences between the two groups. Cough was more frequent in the ramipril group (4.8 vs. 0.4%).",

Renal plasma flow responses were lower in older individuals than younger (P = 0.03, hypertensive patients; P = 0.004, normotensive individuals). Both hypertensive patients and normotensive individuals carrying either angiotensinogen 235MM or MT genotypes showed this inverse association (P = 0.005, hypertensive patients; P = 0.05, normotensive individuals). However, among angiotensinogen 235TT homozygotes the pattern differed: normotensive individuals had a fall in renal vascular responsiveness with age (P = 0.01) but hypertensive patients did not (P = 0.72). Young hypertensive patients already showed blunted responses. Of all genotype subsets, only angiotensinogen 235TT hypertensive patients showed enhancement (P = 0.03) of the renal vascular responsiveness to angiotensin II after captopril.",

In the pooled estimate, there were no significant differences between angiotensin II receptor blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors on the risk of myocardial infarction (odds ratio 1.01; 95% confidence interval 0.95-1.07; P = 0.75), cardiovascular mortality (odds ratio 1.03; 95% confidence interval 0.98-1.08; P = 0.23) and total mortality (odds ratio 1.03; 95% confidence interval 0.97-1.10; P = 0.20). This was the case also when the analysis involved only the comparison between angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. Overall, the risk of stroke was slightly lower with angiotensin II receptor blockers than angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (odds ratio 0.92; 95% confidence interval 0.85-0.99; P = 0.037), the direct angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers comparison showing a nonsignificant trend in a similar direction.

    "906": "Despite the huge amount of studies looking for candidate genes, the ACE gene remains the unique, well-characterized locus clearly associated with pathogenesis and progression of chronic kidney disease, and with response to treatment with drugs that directly interfere with the renin angiotensin system (RAS), such as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists (ARA). The II genotype is protective against development and progression of type I and type II nephropathy and is associated with a slower progression of nondiabetic proteinuric kidney disease. ACE inhibitors are particularly effective at the stage of normoalbuminuria or microalbuminuria in both type I and type II diabetics with the II genotype, whereas the DD genotype is associated with a better response to ARA therapy in overt nephropathy of type II diabetes and to ACE inhibitors in male patients with nondiabetic proteinuric nephropathies. The role of other RAS or non-RAS polymorphisms and their possible interactions with different ACE I/D genotypes are less clearly defined. Thus, evaluating the ACE I/D polymorphism is a reliable tool to identify patients at risk and those who may benefit the most of renoprotective therapy with ACE inhibitors or ARA. This may guide pharmacologic therapy in individual patients and help design clinical trials in progressive nephropathies. Moreover, it might help optimize prevention and intervention strategies at population levels, in particular, in countries where resources are extremely limited and 1 million patients continue to die every year of cardiovascular or renal disease.",

Time series analyses demonstrated increases in the growth rate for all drug classes, with the greatest annual change in prescriptions occurring during the 1999 to 2002 time period (except in angiotensin receptor blockers). An increase in prescriptions for fixed-dose combination products occurred, which was temporally related to the change in CHEP recommendations encouraging their use in 2001. The proportion of physician office visits for hypertension increased significantly from 4.9% in 1995 to 6.8% in 2005 (P<0.001).",

For the pharmacological management of hypertension, treatment thresholds and targets should be predicated on by the patient's global atherosclerotic risk, target organ damage and comorbid conditions. Blood pressure should be decreased to lower than 140/90 mmHg in all patients, and to lower than 130/80 mmHg in those with diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease. Most patients will require more than one agent to achieve these target blood pressures. For adults without compelling indications for other agents, initial therapy should include thiazide diuretics. Other agents appropriate for first-line therapy for diastolic and/or systolic hypertension include angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (in nonblack patients), long-acting calcium channel blockers (CCBs), angiotensin receptor antagonists (ARBs) or beta-blockers (in those younger than 60 years of age). A combination of two first-line agents may also be considered for initial treatment of hypertension if systolic blood pressure is 20 mmHg above target or if diastolic blood pressure is 10 mmHg above target. Other agents appropriate for first-line therapy for isolated systolic hypertension include long-acting dihydropyridine CCBs or ARBs. In patients with angina, recent myocardial infarction or heart failure, beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors are recommended as first-line therapy; in patients with cerebrovascular disease, an ACE inhibitor/diuretic combination is preferred; in patients with proteinuric nondiabetic chronic kidney disease, ACE inhibitors are recommended; and in patients with diabetes mellitus, ACE inhibitors or ARBs (or, in patients without albuminuria, thiazides or dihydropyridine CCBs) are appropriate first-line therapies. All hypertensive patients with dyslipidemia should be treated using the thresholds, targets and agents outlined in the Canadian Cardiovascular Society position statement (recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of dyslipidemia and prevention of cardiovascular disease). Selected high-risk patients with hypertension but who do not achieve thresholds for statin therapy according to the position paper should nonetheless receive statin therapy.

This study evaluated the results of six trials of ACE inhibitors in children, using meta-analytic techniques to estimate the effect of race on blood pressure response."
