    "0": "The vascular endothelium not only is a single monolayer of cells between the vessel lumen and the intimal wall, but also plays an important role by controlling vascular function and structure mainly via the production of nitric oxide (NO). The so called \"cardiovascular risk factors\" are associated with endothelial dysfunction, that reduces NO bioavailability, increases oxidative stress, and promotes inflammation contributing therefore to the development of atherosclerosis. The significant role of endothelial dysfunction in the development of atherosclerosis emphasizes the need for efficient therapeutic interventions. During the last years statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor antagonists, antioxidants, beta-blockers and insulin sensitizers have been evaluated for their ability to restore endothelial function (Briasoulis et al., 2012). As there is not a straightforward relationship between therapeutic interventions and improvement of endothelial function but rather a complicated interrelationship between multiple cellular and sub-cellular targets, research has been focused on the understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Moreover, the development of novel diagnostic invasive and non-invasive methods has allowed the early detection of endothelial dysfunction expanding the role of therapeutic interventions and our knowledge. In the current review we present the available data concerning the contribution of endothelial dysfunction to atherogenesis and review the methods that assess endothelial function with a view to understand the multiple targets of therapeutic interventions. Finally we focus on the classic and novel therapeutic approaches aiming to improve endothelial dysfunction and the underlying mechanisms.", 
    "1": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have shown to decrease mortality and cardiovascular morbidity especially in high-risk patients after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Aim of this study was to assess the association between ACEI or ARB treatment (ACEI/ARB) at hospital discharge and long-term survival after AMI in real-life patient care. From a German population-based AMI registry, 3,544 patients (75.4% men), aged 28 to 74\u00a0years, hospitalized with an incident AMI between 2000 and 2008, surviving at least 24\u00a0hours and treated with \u03b2 blockers and antiplatelet agents at discharge were included in this study. All data were collected by standardized interviews and chart review. End point of this study was all-cause mortality at 3 follow-up periods: 1, 3, and 5\u00a0years after AMI. Mortality was assessed for all registered patients in 2010. Survival analyses and multivariable Cox regression analyses were conducted. Of the 3,544 patients, 83.7% received ACEI/ARB and 90.1% were treated with statins at hospital discharge. During a median follow-up period of 5.0\u00a0years (interquartile range 1.0\u00a0years), 9.3% patients died. In the multivariable Cox models adjusting for a number of covariates, use of ACEI/ARB showed a significantly inverse relation with 1-, 3-, and 5-year mortality (e.g., 5-year mortality: hazard ratio 0.74, 95% confidence interval 0.59 to 0.94, p\u00a0= 0.015), and the hazard ratios for mortality did not differ significantly between the 3 examined follow-up periods. In conclusion, use of ACEI/ARB at hospital discharge is independently associated with long-term survival benefit in patients with incident AMI already treated with other guideline-recommended cardiovascular drugs.", 
    "2": "Hepatic fibrosis is a wound-healing response to various chronic stimuli, including viral hepatitis B or C infection. Activated myofibroblasts, predominantly derived from the hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), regulate the balance between matrix metalloproteinases and their tissue inhibitors to maintain extracellular matrix homeostasis. Transforming growth factor-\u03b2 and platelet-derived growth factor are classic profibrogenic signals that activate HSC proliferation. In addition, proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines coordinate macrophages, T cells, NK/NKT cells, and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells in complex fibrogenic and regression processes. In addition, fibrogenesis involves angiogenesis, metabolic reprogramming, autophagy, microRNA, and epigenetic regulations. Hepatic inflammation is the driving force behind liver fibrosis; however, host single nucleotide polymorphisms and viral factors, including the genotype, viral load, viral mutation, and viral proteins, have been associated with fibrosis progression. Eliminating the underlying etiology is the most crucial antifibrotic therapy. Growing evidence has indicated that persistent viral suppression with antiviral therapy can result in fibrosis regression, reduced liver disease progression, decreased hepatocellular carcinoma, and improved chances of survival. Preclinical studies and clinical trials are currently examining several investigational agents that target key fibrogenic pathways; the results are promising and shed light on this debilitating illness.", 
    "3": "Improvements in the survival of children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer have resulted in a growing population of childhood, adolescent and adult cancer and stem cell transplant survivors. Approximately two thirds of these survivors will experience at least 1 late effect of their treatment, and about one third will experience a late effect that is severe or life threatening. Childhood cancer survivors are at high risk for development of severe cardiac disease, particularly after anthracycline and/or radiation exposure. Cardiotoxicity can present as early cardiac dysfunction during or shortly after therapy or as chronic impairment of cardiac function several years after treatment. Attempts to minimize serious adverse effects have included reduction of high-dose chemotherapy, particularly anthracycline dosing to <350 mg/m, use of cardioprotective agents such as dexrazoxane and decreased radiation dosing and radiation fields. There have been no convincing data showing medical interventions that can reliably slow or reverse cardiotoxicity in treated patients, which therefore warrants further studies looking at the use of beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or newer agents either prior to or following the discovery of heart damage. Emphasis on the prevention of further damage is critical and can be accomplished through aggressive surveillance, including screening for lipid abnormalities, cardiac biomarkers such as troponins and B-type natriuretic peptides, hypertension, diabetes and obesity as well as the use of echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging to identify abnormalities early in their course. Here, we provide an overview of the field of cardio-oncology to stimulate interest among cardiologists.", 
    "4": "We present a serious case of bradykinin mediated angioedema with upper airway disorders resulting from drug interaction between angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and immunosuppressant agents.", 
    "5": "Diseases which have been demonstrated to be caused by increased plasma levels of bradykinin all have angioedema as the common major clinical manifestation. Angioedema due to therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors is caused by suppressed bradykinin degradation so that it accumulates. This occurs because ACE metabolizes bradykinin by removal of Phe-Arg from the C-terminus, which inactivates it. By contrast, angioedema due to C1 inhibitor deficiency (either hereditary types I and II, or acquired) is caused by bradykinin overproduction. C1 inhibitor inhibits factor XIIa, kallikrein and activity associated with the prekallikrein-HK (high-molecular-weight kininogen) complex. In its absence, uncontrolled activation of the plasma bradykinin cascade is seen once there has been an initiating stimulus. C4 levels are low in all types of C1 inhibitor deficiency due to the instability of C1 (C1r, in particular) such that some activated C1 always circulates and depletes C4. In the hereditary disorder, formation of factor XIIf (factor XII fragment) during attacks of swelling causes C4 levels to drop toward zero, and C2 levels decline. A kinin-like molecule, once thought to be a cleavage product derived from C2 that contributes to the increased vascular permeability seen in hereditary angioedema (HAE), is now thought to be an artifact, i.e. no such molecule is demonstrable. The acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency is associated with clonal disorders of B cell hyperreactivity, including lymphoma and monoclonal gammopathy. Most cases have an IgG autoantibody to C1 inhibitor which inactivates it so that the presentation is strikingly similar to type I HAE. New therapies for types I and II HAE include C1 inhibitor replacement therapy, ecallantide, a kallikrein antagonist, and icatibant, a B2 receptor antagonist. A newly described type III HAE has normal C1 inhibitor, although it is thought to be mediated by bradykinin, as is an antihistamine-resistant subpopulation of patients with 'idiopathic' angioedema. The mechanism(s) for the formation of bradykinin in these disorders is unknown.",

    "7": "After bilateral renal denervation blood pressure (BP) was measured every 10\u00a0days. On day 50 the heart was (histo)pathologically examined. The ventricular weight to body weight ratios (VW/BW), myocardial diameter and collagen volume fraction (CVF) were calculated, and cardiac hypertrophy marker genes were analyzed by RT-PCR.", 
    "8": "At the baseline evaluation all groups had comparable BP. After treatment the BP of the RSD group was significantly reduced (p\u2009<\u20090.05). The BP of the RSD group was lower than that of the perindopril group on days 10, 20 and 30th (p\u2009<\u20090.05) but on day 50 systolic BP of the RSD group was significantly higher (p\u2009<\u20090.05) whereas there were no significant differences in diastolic BP. The VW/BW decreased in the RSD group, whereas the value did not change significantly in the perindopril group. The myocardial diameter of the left ventricular cardiomyocytes was also significantly lower in the RSD group and stayed the same in the perindopril group. Collagen volume fraction (CVF) in the RSD group was significantly lower than in the perindopril group (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Significant changes in the expression levels of NPPA, MYH7, and MYH6 (P\u2009<\u20090.05) were observed in the RD-SHR groups (p\u2009<\u20090.05). There was a significant difference in the expression level of MYH6 (p\u2009<\u20090.05) between the RSD group and the perindopril group but the expression levels of NPPA and MYH7 were not significantly different.",

    "10": "Nearly all patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) develop renal angiomyolipomas, although the tumor cell of origin is unknown. We observed decreased renal angiomyolipoma development in patients with TSC2- polycystic kidney disease 1 deletion syndrome and hypertension that were treated from an early age with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers compared with patients who did not receive this therapy. TSC-associated renal angiomyolipomas expressed ANG II type 1 receptors, platelet-derived growth factor receptor-\u03b2, desmin, \u03b1-smooth muscle actin, and VEGF receptor 2 but did not express the adipocyte marker S100 or the endothelial marker CD31. Sera of TSC patients exhibited increased vascular mural cell-secreted peptides, such as VEGF-A, VEGF-D, soluble VEGF receptor 2, and collagen type IV. These findings suggest that angiomyolipomas may arise from renal pericytes. ANG II treatment of angiomyolipoma cells in vitro resulted in an exaggerated intracellular Ca(2+) response and increased proliferation, which were blocked by the ANG II type 2 receptor antagonist valsartan. Blockade of ANG II signaling may have preventative therapeutic potential for angiomyolipomas.", 
    "11": "Persistent use of guideline-recommended drugs after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is frequently reported to be inadequate in the elderly and scarce knowledge exists about factors that influence persistence in outpatient care. Our aim was to evaluate drug use and its predictors in survivors of AMI above 64 years from hospital discharge to 1-year post-AMI.",

Cases were defined as those who had been under regular use of oral acetylsalicylic acid for more than six consecutive months. The assessment focused on: age, sex, skin-type, tobacco smoking, use of medication, occurrence of individual or family skin cancer, and sunscreen and sun exposure habits. Actinic keratoses were counted in the medial region of the face and upper limbs. Counts were adjusted by co-variables based on a generalized linear model.", 
    "17": "A total of 74 cases and 216 controls were assessed. The median time of acetylsalicylic acid use was 36 months. Cases differed from controls as to the highest age, highest prevalence of use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and fewer keratosis on the face and on the upper limbs (p<0.05). The multivariate model showed that the use of acetylsalicylic acid was associated to lower counts of face actinic keratosis and upper-limb erythematous actinic keratosis (p<0.05), regardless of other risk factors.",

    "19": "Staphylococcal nuclease domain containing-1 (SND1) is overexpressed in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients and promotes tumorigenesis by human HCC cells. We now document that SND1 increases angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) levels by increasing AT1R mRNA stability. This results in activation of ERK, Smad2 and subsequently the TGF\u03b2 signaling pathway, promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and migration and invasion by human HCC cells. A positive correlation was observed between SND1 and AT1R expression levels in human HCC patients. Small molecule inhibitors of SND1, alone or in combination with AT1R blockers, might be an effective therapeutic strategy for late-stage aggressive HCC.", 
    "20": "The antagonists of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) have gained increasing popularity in the last two decades due to their indisputable efficacy in a number of cardiovascular disorders, coupled with an unsurpassed tolerability. However some years ago a partial and non-predefined meta-analysis raised the possibility that angiotensin receptor antagonists in particular may increase the incidence of cancer. This observation, although not confirmed by subsequent, larger analyses, caused a remarkable and understandable concern even outside the medical community. Herein we will summarize the available evidence pro and con the hypothesis of a carcinogenetic activity of RAS antagonists coming to the conclusion that these drugs may actually exert an anticancer action.", 
    "21": "Hypertension is common in deep brain stimulator (DBS) placement predisposing to intracranial hemorrhage. This retrospective review evaluates factors predicting incremental antihypertensive use intraoperatively. Medical records of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients undergoing DBS procedure between 2008-2011 were reviewed after Institutional Review Board approval. Anesthesia medication, preoperative levodopa dose, age, preoperative use of antihypertensive medications, diabetes mellitus, anxiety, motor part of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale score and PD duration were collected. Univariate and multivariate analysis was done between each patient characteristic and the number of antihypertensive boluses. From the 136 patients included 60 were hypertensive, of whom 32 were on angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), told to hold on the morning of surgery. Antihypertensive medications were given to 130 patients intraoperatively. Age (relative risk [RR] 1.01; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00-1.02; p=0.005), high Joint National Committee (JNC) class (p<0.0001), diabetes mellitus (RR 1.4; 95%CI 1.2-17; p<0.0001) and duration of PD >10 years (RR 1.2; 95%CI 1.1-1.3; p=0.001) were independent predictors for antihypertensive use. No difference was noted in the mean dose of levodopa (p=0.1) and levodopa equivalent dose (p=0.4) between the low (I/II) and high severity (III/IV) JNC groups. Addition of dexmedetomidine to propofol did not influence antihypertensive boluses required (p=0.38). Intraoperative hypertension during DBS surgery is associated with higher age group, hypertensive, diabetic patients and longer duration of PD. Withholding ACEI or ARB is an independent predictor of hypertension requiring more aggressive therapy. Levodopa withdrawal and choice of anesthetic agent is not associated with higher intraoperative antihypertensive medications.", 
    "22": "Hypertension is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease, kidney disease, and stroke. Interest in medicinal or nutraceutical plant bioactives to reduce hypertension has increased dramatically. The main biological regulation of mammalian blood pressure is via the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. The key enzyme is angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) that converts angiotensin I into the powerful vasoconstrictor, angiotensin II. Angiotensin II binds to its receptors (AT1) on smooth muscle cells of the arteriole vasculature causing vasoconstriction and elevation of blood pressure. This review focuses on the in vitro and in vivo reports of plant-derived extracts that inhibit ACE activity, block angiotensin II receptor binding and demonstrate hypotensive activity in animal or human studies. We describe 74 families of plants that exhibited significant ACE inhibitory activity and 16 plant families with potential AT1 receptor blocking activity, according to in vitro studies. From 43 plant families including some of those with in vitro bioactivity, the extracts from 73 plant species lowered blood pressure in various normotensive or hypertensive in vivo models by the oral route. Of these, 19 species from 15 families lowered human BP when administered orally. Some of the active plant extracts, isolated bioactives and BP-lowering mechanisms are discussed.",

The active fraction was purified by repeated column chromatography, including silica gel, Sephadex LH-20 column, medium-pressure liquid chromatography (MPLC) (polyamide column) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The isolated major constituents were tested for their anti-platelet aggregation activity.", 
    "25": "Bioassay-directed separation of the EtOAc fraction of the 70% ethanol extract from the air-dried aerial parts of T. hohenackeri led to the isolation of a new triterpenoid lactone (1), together with 13 known compounds (2-14). It was the first time to focus on screening bioactive constituents for this plant. The chemical structures were established on the basis of spectral data (ESI-MS and NMR). The results showed that the flavonoid compounds (7 and 8) and phenolic compounds (9, 10, 11, and 14) were potential ACE inhibitors. And the flavonoid compounds (5 and 7) showed significant anti-platelet aggregation activities.", 
    "26": "On the basis of the chemical and biological data, the material basis of ACE inhibitory activity for the active part was the phenolic constituents. However, the flavonoid compounds were responsible for the anti-platelet aggregation. The primary structure and activity relationship were also discussed respectively.", 
    "27": "Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker (ARB), when given with angiotensin II prevents AAA formation in mice, but found ineffective in attenuating the progression of preexisting AAA. This study was designed to evaluate the effect of chronic RAS blockers on abdominal aortic diameter in hypertensive patients without known aortic aneurysm. Consecutive hypertensive outpatients (n\u00a0=\u00a0122) were stratified according to antihypertensive therapy they received for 12\u00a0months or more, consisting of ARB (n\u00a0=\u00a045), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I; n\u00a0=\u00a045), or nonARB/nonACE-I (control therapy; n\u00a0=\u00a032). Abdominal ultrasonography was performed to measure maximal subrenal aortic diameter. Eighty-four patients were reexamined by ultrasonography 8\u00a0months later. The correlation between the different antihypertensive therapies and aortic diameter was examined. Aortic diameters were significantly smaller in ARB than in control patients in the baseline and follow-up measurements (P\u00a0=\u00a0.004; P\u00a0=\u00a0.0004, respectively). Risk factor adjusted covariance analysis showed significant differences between ARB or ACE-I treated groups and controls (P\u00a0=\u00a0.006 or P\u00a0=\u00a0.046, respectively). Ultrasound that was performed 8\u00a0months later showed smaller increases in mean aortic diameters of the ARB and ACE-I groups than in controls. Both ARB and ACE-I therapy attenuated expansion of nonaneurysmal abdominal aorta in humans. These results indicate that RAS blockade given before advancement of aortic medial remodeling may slow down the development of AAA.", 
    "28": "Blocking the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) can reduce the risk of diabetes. Meanwhile, the angiotensin (Ang)-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2)/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis has recently been proposed to function as a negative regulator of the RAS. In previous studies, we first demonstrated that ACE2 knockout (ACE2(-/)(y)) mice exhibit impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes. However the precise roles of ACE2 on glucose metabolism are unknown. Here we show that the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis can ameliorate insulin resistance in the liver. Activation of the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis increases glucose uptake and decreases glycogen synthesis in the liver accompanied by increased expression of glucose transporters, insulin receptor substrates and decreased expression of enzymes for glycogen synthesis. ACE2 knockout mice displayed elevated levels of oxidative stress and exposure to Ang-(1-7) reduced the stress in hepatic cells. As a consequence of anti-oxidative stress, activation of the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis led to improved hepatic insulin resistance through the Akt/PI3K/IRS-1/JNK insulin signaling pathway. This is the first time documented that the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis can ameliorate insulin resistance in the liver. As insulin resistance in the liver is considered to be the primary cause of the development of type 2 diabetes, this axis may serve as a new diabetes target.",

The Cache County Study of Memory Health and Aging is a prospective longitudinal cohort study of dementing illnesses among the elderly population of Cache County, Utah. Using waves I to IV data of the Cache County Study, 3417 participants had a mean of 7.1 years of follow-up. Time-varying use of antihypertensive medications including different class of diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, \u03b2-blockers, and calcium channel blockers was used to predict the incidence of AD using Cox proportional hazards analyses. During follow-up, 325 AD cases were ascertained with a total of 23,590 person-years. Use of any antihypertensive medication was associated with lower incidence of AD (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.77; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.61-0.97). Among different classes of antihypertensive medications, thiazide (aHR, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.53-0.93), and potassium-sparing diuretics (aHR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.48-0.99) were associated with the greatest reduction of AD risk.

Moreover, it is unknown whether stimulating the NO/heme-independent sGC provides additional benefits to ACE inhibition in chronic ischemic heart failure. Starting 10 days after MI, rats were treated with placebo, the sGC activator ataciguat (10 mg/kg/twice daily), ramipril (1 mg/kg/day), or a combination of both for 9 weeks. Long-term ataciguat therapy reduced left ventricular (LV) diastolic filling pressure and pulmonary edema, improved the rightward shift of the pressure-volume curve, LV contractile function and diastolic stiffness, without lowering blood pressure. NO/heme-independent sGC activation provided protection over ACE inhibition against mitochondrial superoxide production and progressive fibrotic remodeling, ultimately leading to a further improvement of cardiac performance, hypertrophic growth and heart failure. We found that ataciguat stimulating sGC activity was potentiated in (myo)fibroblasts during hypoxia-induced oxidative stress and that NO/heme-independent sGC activation modulated fibroblast-cardiomyocyte crosstalk in the context of heart failure and hypoxia. In addition, ataciguat inhibited human cardiac fibroblast differentiation and extracellular matrix protein production in response to TGF-\u03b21. Overall, long-term sGC activation targeting extracellular matrix homeostasis conferred cardioprotection against progressive cardiac dysfunction, pathological remodeling and heart failure after myocardial infarction. NO/heme-independent sGC activation may prove to be a useful therapeutic target in patients with chronic heart failure and ongoing fibrotic remodeling.", 
    "43": "Qiliqiangxin (QL), a traditional Chinese medicine, has been shown to be beneficial for chronic heart failure. However, whether QL can also improve endothelial cell function in diabetic rats remains unknown. Here, we investigated the effect of QL treatment on endothelial dysfunction by comparing the effect of QL to that of benazepril (Ben) in diabetic Sprague-Dawley rats for 8 weeks. Cardiac function was evaluated by echocardiography and catheterization. Assays for acetylcholine-induced, endothelium-dependent relaxation (EDR), sodium nitroprusside-induced endothelium-independent relaxation, serum nitric oxide (NO), and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) as well as histological analyses were performed to assess endothelial function. Diabetic rats showed significantly inhibited cardiac function and EDR, decreased expression of serum NO and phosphorylation at Ser(1177) on endothelial NOS (eNOS), and impaired endothelial integrity after 8 weeks. Chronic treatment for 8 weeks with either QL or Ben prevented the inhibition of cardiac function and EDR and the decrease in serum NO and eNOS phosphorylation caused by diabetes. Moreover, either QL or Ben suppressed inducible NOS (iNOS) protein levels as well as endothelial necrosis compared with the diabetic rats. Additionally, QL prevented the increase in angiotensin-converting enzyme 1 and angiotensin II receptor type 1 in diabetes. Thus, chronic administration of QL improved serum NO production, EDR, and endothelial integrity in diabetic rat aortas, possibly through balancing eNOS and iNOS activity and decreasing renin-angiotensin system expression.",

    "55": "Mesangial cell injury has a major role in many CKDs. Because renin-positive precursor cells give rise to mesangial cells during nephrogenesis, this study tested the hypothesis that the same phenomenon contributes to glomerular regeneration after murine experimental mesangial injury. Mesangiolysis was induced by administration of an anti-mesangial cell serum in combination with LPS. In enhanced green fluorescent protein-reporter mice with constitutively labeled renin lineage cells, the size of the enhanced green fluorescent protein-positive area in the glomerular tufts increased after mesangial injury. Furthermore, we generated a novel Tet-on inducible triple-transgenic LacZ reporter line that allowed selective labeling of renin cells along renal afferent arterioles of adult mice. Although no intraglomerular LacZ expression was detected in healthy mice, about two-thirds of the glomerular tufts became LacZ positive during the regenerative phase after severe mesangial injury. Intraglomerular renin descendant LacZ-expressing cells colocalized with mesangial cell markers \u03b18-integrin and PDGF receptor-\u03b2 but not with endothelial, podocyte, or parietal epithelial cell markers. In contrast with LacZ-positive cells in the afferent arterioles, LacZ-positive cells in the glomerular tuft did not express renin. These data demonstrate that extraglomerular renin lineage cells represent a major source of repopulating cells for reconstitution of the intraglomerular mesangium after injury.",

    "66": "The K-26 family of bacterial secondary metabolites are N-modified tripeptides terminated by an unusual phosphonate analog of tyrosine. These natural products, produced via three different actinomycetales, are potent inhibitors of human angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE). Herein we investigate the interkingdom pharmacology of the K-26 family by synthesizing these metabolites and assessing their potency as inhibitors of both the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of human ACE. In most cases, selectivity for the C-terminal domain of ACE is displayed. Co-crystallization of K-26 in both domains of human ACE reveals the structural basis of the potent inhibition and has shown an unusual binding motif that may guide future design of domain-selective inhibitors. Finally, the activity of K-26 is assayed against a cohort of microbially produced ACE relatives. In contrast to the synthetic ACE inhibitor captopril, which demonstrates broad interkingdom inhibition of ACE-like enzymes, K-26 selectively targets the eukaryotic family.",

However, a number of issues limit the use of AIT, many of them being not actually supported by solid data from the literature. In particular, several contraindications to AIT deserve to be argued, being needed to accurately balance in single cases the benefits versus the disadvantages. This concerns comorbidities, such as autoimmune diseases and malignancies, concomitant drug treatments, particularly \u03b2-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, pregnancy, patient's age, the severity of asthma, allergen polysensitization and the period of starting the treatment. Another important aspect producing misconceptions on AIT is the quality of the allergen extracts, because currently a patient with respiratory allergy to a given source may be prescribed to treat his allergyby products with very different quality. Improving characterization and standardization of allergen extracts will pave the way to the general acknowledgment of AIT as an effective treatment.",

    "72": "Resistant hypertension-uncontrolled hypertension with 3 or more antihypertensive agents-is increasingly common in clinical practice. Clinicians should exclude pseudoresistant hypertension, which results from nonadherence to medications or from elevated blood pressure related to the white coat syndrome. In patients with truly resistant hypertension, thiazide diuretics, particularly chlorthalidone, should be considered as one of the initial agents. The other 2 agents should include calcium channel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors for cardiovascular protection. An increasing body of evidence has suggested benefits of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, such as eplerenone and spironolactone, in improving blood pressure control in patients with resistant hypertension, regardless of circulating aldosterone levels. Thus, this class of drugs should be considered for patients whose blood pressure remains elevated after treatment with a 3-drug regimen to maximal or near maximal doses. Resistant hypertension may be associated with secondary causes of hypertension including obstructive sleep apnea or primary aldosteronism. Treating these disorders can significantly improve blood pressure beyond medical therapy alone. The role of device therapy for treating the typical patient with resistant hypertension remains unclear.", 
    "73": "Epidemiological, preclinical and clinical studies established the association between high alcohol consumption and hypertension. However the mechanism through which alcohol raises blood pressure remains elusive. Several possible mechanisms have been proposed such as an imbalance of the central nervous system, impairment of the baroreceptors, enhanced sympathetic activity, stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, increased cortisol levels, increased vascular reactivity due to increase in intracellular calcium levels, stimulation of the endothelium to release vasoconstrictors and loss of relaxation due to inflammation and oxidative injury of the endothelium leading to inhibition of endothelium-dependent nitric oxide production. Loss of relaxation due to inflammation and oxidative injury of the endothelium by angiotensin II leading to inhibition of endothelium-dependent nitric oxide production is the major contributors of the alcohol-induced hypertension. For the prevention of alcohol-induced hypertension is to reduce the amount of alcohol intake. Physical conditioning/exercise training is one of the most important strategies to prevent/treat chronic alcohol-induced hypertension on physiological basis. The efficacious pharmacologic treatment includes the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) which have antioxidant activity and calcium channel blockers. The most effective prevention and treatment of alcohol-induced hypertension is physical exercise and the use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs in the clinic.",

The increases in non-voiding contractions, voiding frequency and bladder capacity in 2K-1C rats were prevented by treatments with both drugs. Likewise, losartan and captopril prevented the enhanced bladder contractions to electrical-field stimulation (EFS) and carbachol, along with the impaired relaxations to \u03b2-adrenergic-cAMP stimulation. Enhanced neurogenic contractions and impaired nitrergic relaxations were observed in urethra from 2K-1C rats. Angiotensin II also produced greater urethral contractions that were accompanied by higher phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in urethral tissues of 2K-1C rats. Losartan and captopril normalized the urethral dysfunctions in 2K-1C rats. In contrast, atenolol treatment largely reduced the blood pressure in 2K-1C rats but failed to affect the urinary tract smooth muscle dysfunction. The urinary tract smooth muscle dysfunction in 2K-1C rats takes place by local RAS activation irrespective of levels of arterial blood pressure.",

The in vitro effects of sodium nitrite (0, 1, 3, 10, 30, 100 \u03bcmol/L) on plasma ACE activity were also determined. We found that sodium nitrite did not affect the pressor responses to angiotensin I. Moreover, while sodium nitrite exerted significant antihypertensive effects in acute and chronic hypertension models, no significant effects on plasma ACE activity were found. In vitro experiments showed no effects of sodium nitrite on plasma ACE activity. This is the first study to demonstrate that the acute and chronic antihypertensive effects of sodium nitrite are not associated with significant inhibition of circulating ACE activity.",

    "120": "Angiotensin and endogenous opioids are important bioactive neuropeptides, which are widely distributed in the brain and peripheral regions to produce diverse biological and neurobiological activities. An endogenous opioid system includes proopiomelanocortin-derived enkephalin, dynorphin and endorphin that act on their specific receptors such as delta (\u03b4), kappa (\u03ba) and mu (\u03bc) receptors. Research evidence demonstrates significant positive as well as negative interactions between renin angiotensin system (RAS) and endogenous opioids in the brain and periphery. The diverse actions of Ang II are possibly mediated indirectly through endogenous opioids, while opioids are also shown to activate RAS components suggesting the up-regulation of each system in concern with each other. On the contrary, there are reports suggesting a negative correlation between RAS and opioid system. Research evidence also supports the notion that Ang II acts as anti-opioid peptide to decrease the actions of opioids. Moreover, opioids-induced decline in angiotensin release and functioning has also been reported. Co-administration of ACE inhibitors with opioids exhibits significant interactions possibly due to decreased metabolism of opioids leading to potentiation of their actions. The present review describes the complexities of positive and negative interactions between RAS and opioids along with possible mechanisms responsible for these interactions.", 
    "121": "In this work, genes encoding gelatinase (gelE) and serine proteinase (sprE), two extracellular proteases produced by Enterococcus faecalis DBH18, were cloned in the protein expression vector pMG36c, containing the constitutive P32 promoter, generating the recombinant plasmids pCG, pCSP, and pCGSP encoding gelE, sprE, and gelE-sprE, respectively. Transformation of noncaseinolytic E. faecalis P36, E. faecalis JH2-2, E. faecium AR24, and E. hirae AR14 strains with these plasmids permitted detection of caseinolytic activity only in the strains transformed with pCG or pCGSP. Complementation of a deletion (knockout) mutant of E. faecalis V583 for production of gelatinase (GelE) with pCG unequivocally supported that gelE is responsible for the caseinolytic activity of the transformed strain grown in bovine skim milk (BSM). RP-HPLC-MS/MS analysis of hydrolysates of transformed Enterococcus spp. strains grown in BSM permitted the identification of 38 major peptide fragments including peptides with previously reported angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory activity (ACE-IA), antihypertensive activity, and antioxidant activity.",

    "129": "Peritoneal dialysis (PD) continues to be underutilized in the United States, even though it is less expensive, provides better quality of life and has better outcomes compared with hemodialysis. The reasons for low utilization of PD are influenced by complex psychosocial and economic factors, lack of physician training, physician bias and inadequate pre-end-stage renal disease care and education to the patients. Providing quality pre-end-stage renal disease education to patients and families and improving education and training of physician in PD, so that they become comfortable with the therapy, are of paramount importance to increase PD growth. Minimizing episodes of PD-related infections and noninfectious complications, preserving peritoneal membrane using more biocompatible solutions and drugs, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, and careful management of volume status can reduce the loss of PD patients to hemodialysis. Timely surgical interventions can prevent the malfunction and loss of PD catheters. Consolidating smaller PD facilities in a given geographical area into a single large PD center can further improve PD outcomes and PD growth. Finally, with the introduction of bundled payment for dialysis services, PD may emerge as a cost-effective therapy and rekindle interest in the dialysis community to consider PD as a better renal replacement therapy option.",

The mean age of the participants was 55 years and baseline blood pressure was 158/99 mmHg. Adequate blood pressure-lowering efficacy data were available for hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone and indapamide. We judged 54 (90%) included trials to have unclear or high risk of bias, which impacted on our confidence in the results for some of our outcomes.In 33 trials with a baseline blood pressure of 155/100 mmHg, hydrochlorothiazide lowered blood pressure based on dose, with doses of 6.25 mg, 12.5 mg, 25 mg and 50 mg/day lowering blood pressure compared to placebo by 4 mmHg (95% CI 2 to 6, moderate-quality evidence)/2 mmHg (95% CI 1 to 4, moderate-quality evidence), 6 mmHg (95% CI 5 to 7, high-quality evidence)/3 mmHg (95% CI 3 to 4, high-quality evidence), 8 mmHg (95% CI 7 to 9, high-quality evidence)/3 mmHg (95% CI 3 to 4, high-quality evidence) and 11 mmHg (95% CI 6 to 15, low-quality evidence)/5 mmHg (95% CI 3 to 7, low-quality evidence), respectively.Direct comparison of doses did not show evidence of dose dependence for blood pressure-lowering for any of the other thiazides for which RCT data were available: bendrofluazide, chlorthalidone, cyclopenthiazide, metolazone or indapamide.In seven trials with a baseline blood pressure of 163/88 mmHg, chlorthalidone at doses of 12.5 mg to 75 mg/day reduced average blood pressure compared to placebo by 12.0 mmHg (95% CI 10 to 14, low-quality evidence)/4 mmHg (95% CI 3 to 5, low-quality evidence).In 10 trials with a baseline blood pressure of 161/98 mmHg, indapamide at doses of 1.0 mg to 5.0 mg/day reduced blood pressure compared to placebo by 9 mmHg (95% CI 7 to 10, low-quality evidence)/4 (95% CI 3 to 5, low-quality evidence).We judged the maximal blood pressure-lowering effect of the different thiazides to be similar. Overall, thiazides reduced average blood pressure compared to placebo by 9 mmHg (95% CI 9 to 10, high-quality evidence)/4 mmHg (95% CI 3 to 4, high-quality evidence).Thiazides as a class have a greater effect on systolic than on diastolic blood pressure, therefore thiazides lower pulse pressure by 4 mmHg to 6 mmHg, an amount that is greater than the 3 mmHg seen with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and renin inhibitors, and the 2 mmHg seen with non-selective beta-blockers. This is based on an informal indirect comparison of results observed in other Cochrane reviews on ACE inhibitors, ARBs and renin inhibitors compared with placebo, which used similar inclusion/exclusion criteria to the present review.Thiazides reduced potassium, increased uric acid and increased total cholesterol and triglycerides. These effects were dose-related and were least for hydrochlorothiazide. Chlorthalidone increased serum glucose but the evidence was unclear for other thiazides.

For other thiazide drugs, the lowest doses studied lowered blood pressure maximally and higher doses did not lower it more. Due to the greater effect on systolic than on diastolic blood pressure, thiazides lower pulse pressure by 4 mmHg to 6 mmHg. This exceeds the mean 3 mmHg pulse pressure reduction achieved by ACE inhibitors, ARBs and renin inhibitors, and the 2 mmHg pulse pressure reduction with non-selective beta-blockers as shown in other Cochrane reviews, which compared these antihypertensive drug classes with placebo and used similar inclusion/exclusion criteria.Thiazides did not increase withdrawals due to adverse effects in these short-term trials but there is a high risk of bias for that outcome.

During incubation, ACE inhibitory activity of the peptides remained stable before day 12 and then increased markedly on day 15. Two ACE inhibitory peptides, VGVIKAVDKKAGGAGKVT and HLFGPPGKKDPV, were purified from peptides on day 15 by consecutive chromatography. Because HLFGPPGKKDPV possessed a higher ACE inhibitory activity (IC50 = 125 \u03bcM), an antihypertensive effect of this peptide was further evaluated in vivo. The result showed that this peptide had an antihypertensive effect in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) at a dosage of 10 mg/kg. Furthermore, Lineweaver-Burk plots suggested that HLFGPPGKKDPV played as a non-competitive inhibitor against ACE, as supported by docking simulation. These data indicated that a fertilized egg has potential as antihypertensive components in functional foods and nutraceuticals.",

However, its efficacy relative to renin\u2013angiotensin system blockade, the most effective antifibrotic strategy currently available, is not known. We compared the individual versus combined antifibrotic effects of serelaxin (a recombinant form of human gene-2 relaxin) and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril, in preventative (started before injury) and therapeutic (treatment of established fibrosis) strategies, in a mouse model of isoprenaline-induced cardiac injury (at 17 days). Changes in systolic blood pressure, organ hypertrophy, and tissue remodeling/fibrosis were assessed. Pretreatment with serelaxin (0.5 mg/kg per day via subcutaneous administration) alone reduced cardiac fibrosis to a greater extent than enalapril (200 mg/L via drinking water; equivalent to 48 mg/kg per day) alone (P<0.05 versus enalapril alone). Additionally, the combined effects of serelaxin and enalapril reduced cardiac fibrosis by at least 2-fold compared with enalapril alone, when administered preventatively or therapeutically; by suppressing transforming growth factor-\u03b21 expression and phosphorylation of Smad2 (an intracellular regulator of transforming growth factor-\u03b21 activity; both P<0.05 versus enalapril alone) to a greater extent. The effects of serelaxin were independent of blood pressure, while enalapril lowered systolic blood pressure in the model studied. These findings suggest that serelaxin alone and in combination with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor more effectively ameliorates fibrosis than angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition alone in the diseased heart, in a clinically relevant experimental scenario.",

    "171": "Peritoneal fibrosis is a complication of patients with long-term continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Reports have indicated that angiotensin (Ang) II may correlate with the development of peritoneal fibrosis. However, it is unknown whether aldosterone also has a role in the development of peritoneal inflammation and fibrosis. The aim of the present study was to clarify the role of aldosterone in peritoneal inflammation and fibrosis. A rat model of peritoneal inflammation and fibrosis was established by daily intraperitoneal injection of dialysates and lipopolysaccharide in a 4-day interval over a period of 7 days. The animals were randomly assigned to five groups as follows: control (C); peritoneal dialysis (PD); peritoneal dialysis-spironolactone (PD-S); peritoneal dialysis-cilazapril (PD-C); and peritoneal dialysis-spironolactone-cilazapril (PD-SC). After 30 days, the TGF-\u03b21 concentration in dialysates from all treatment groups was determined by ELISA. The histopathology of the parietal peritoneum was examined, and the expression of MCP-1, c-Jun, fibronectin (FN) and TGF-\u03b21 in the abdominal membrane was determined by immunohistochemistry. Mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11\u03b2-HSD2) and CYP11B2 (aldosterone synthase) were analyzed by real time-PCR. Collagen deposition was significantly higher in PD compared with the other groups. The expression of MR, 11\u03b2-HSD2 and CYP11B2 was significantly higher in PD compared with the other groups. Spironolactone and/or cilazapril treatment partially ablated the increase in monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, p-c-Jun, transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21, FN, MR, 11\u03b2-HSD2 and CYP11B2. Furthermore, treatment with spironolactone and/or cilazapril also reduced the infiltration of CD-4- and ED-1-positive cells in rat peritoneal tissues after peritoneal fibrosis. Exogenous aldosterone may have a key role in the development of peritoneal inflammation and fibrosis. Spironolactone decreased peritoneal inflammation and fibrosis, which was associated with reduced secretion from peritoneal macrophages, inactivation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway and subsequent downregulation of the expression of TGF-\u03b21.", 
    "172": "In recent years, much attention has focused on the role of aldosterone and mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs) in the pathophysiology of hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Patients with primary aldosteronism, in whom angiotensin II levels are low, have a higher incidence of cardiovascular complications than patients with essential hypertension. The Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES) demonstrated that adding a non-specific MR antagonist, spironolactone, to a standard therapy that included angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, loop diuretics, and digoxin, significantly reduced morbidity and mortality in patients with moderate to severe heart failure. Similarly, the Eplerenone Post-Acute Myocardial Infarction Heart Failure Efficacy and Survival Study (EPHESUS) showed that the addition of a selective MR antagonist (ARM), eplerenone, to an optimal medical therapy reduces morbidity and mortality among patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. These data suggest that aldosterone induces cardiac injury through activation of MRs and support the notion that MR blockade has beneficial effects on aldosterone-dependent cardiac injury, through mechanisms that cannot be simply explained by hemodynamic changes. Although, MRA are highly effective in patients with heart failure, the risk of hyperkalemia should not be overlooked. Serious hyperkalemia events were reported in some MRA clinical trials; however these risks can be mitigated through appropriate patient selection, dose selection, patient education, monitoring, and follow-up.",

AT1R blockers reduce tumor volume and decrease liver and lung metastasis in murine models of osteosarcoma. Expression and function of the alternative ACE2/Ang(1-7)/Mas axis in osteosarcoma is yet to be studied. In the present study, the basic and interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2-stimulated expression of components of this alternative RAS axis were analyzed and the impact of Mas on proliferation and/or migration of U-2 OS and MNNG-HOS osteosarcoma cells was studied. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction revealed that the two cell lines expressed the Ang(1\u20117)-generating peptidases ACE2, neutral endopeptidase 24.11 and prolyl-endopeptidase together with the putative receptor for Ang(1-7), Mas. IL-1\u03b2 provoked an induction of Mas mRNA and protein expression which was associated with a reduction of proliferation and migration. By contrast, small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of Mas expression led to increased cell proliferation. In conclusion, osteosarcoma cells express a functional active alternative ACE2/Ang(1-7)/Mas axis. The induction and reinforcement of this axis may be beneficial for the treatment of osteosarcoma by reducing growth and preventing cancer metastasis. These effects may be achieved directly by the administration of Mas agonists or, indirectly, via blocking the classical AngII RAS axis via ACE inhibitors or AT1R antagonists.",

Now that 90% of children with congenital heart disease survive into adulthood, such combinations of disease are increasingly seen in adult cardiology. While most young patients with dilated cardiomyopathy respond well to medical therapy, some do not, and require more invasive management. We describe a 32 year-old man with dilated cardiomyopathy and a sinus venosus-type atrial septal defect associated with a remarkable pulmonary to systemic flow ratio of 5:1. We propose that the atrial septal defect blunted his heart failure symptoms by serving as a 'pop-off' valve and limiting pulmonary congestion.

    "180": "The discovery of renal progenitor cells lining the Bowman capsule of adult rat and human kidneys has shed light on the mechanism of repair by ACEi. Parietal progenitors are a reservoir of cells that contribute to podocyte turnover in physiological conditions. In the early phases of renal disease these progenitors migrate chaotically and subsequently proliferate, accumulating in Bowman's space. The abnormal behavior of parietal progenitors is sustained by the activation of CXCR4 receptors in response to an increased production of the chemokine SDF-1 by podocytes activated by the inflammatory environment. Ang II, via the AT1 receptor, also contributes to progenitor cell proliferation. The CXCR4/SDF-1 and Ang II/AT1 receptor pathogenic pathways both pave the way for lesion formation and subsequent sclerosis. ACEi normalize the CXCR4 and AT1 receptor expression on progenitors, limiting their proliferation, concomitant with the regression of hyperplastic lesions in animals, and in a patient with crescentic glomerulopathy.",

Hence' they are hemodynamically labile and can have accelerated hypertension on induction/extubation. This can have disastrous outcomes. It is a common practice among anesthesiologists to avoid angiotensin converting enzyme(ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers on the day of surgery. This also adds to hypertensive issues perioperatively. Dexmedetomidine is a wonderful drug which can be used during CEA. Due to its centrally mediated sympatholytic effect, it confers good hemodynamic control during induction, intraoperatively, and during extubation. We did a search on PubMed and Google for carotid endarterectomies done under general and locoregional anesthesia during which dexmedetomidine was used.

Albuminuria is the most common manifestation of glomerular damage, with a prevalence between 26 and 68% in adult patients. The pathophysiology of albuminuria in SCD is likely multifactorial, with contributions from hyperfiltration, glomerular hypertension, ischemia-reperfusion injury, oxidative stress, decreased nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, and endothelial dysfunction. Although its natural history in SCD remains inadequately defined, albuminuria is associated with increased echocardiography-derived tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity, systemic blood pressure, and hypertension, as well as history of stroke, suggesting a shared vasculopathic pathophysiology. While most patients with albuminuria are treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, there are no published long-term data on the efficacy of these agents. With the improved patient survival following kidney transplantation, SCD patients with end-stage renal disease should be considered for this treatment modality. Given the high prevalence of albuminuria and its association with multiple SCD-related clinical complications, additional studies are needed to answer several clinically important questions in a bid to adequately elucidate its pathophysiology, natural history, and treatment.", 
    "235": "Central obesity is closely linked to hypertension and type-2 diabetes (DM2) in young/middle-age. In the elderly, systolic hypertension is a reflection of aging/stiff arteries. Diastolic (\u00b1 systolic) hypertension in young/middle-age is accompanied by increased sympathetic nerve activity, particularly in the presence of the metabolic syndrome or DM2. High beta-receptor density (Bmax) and cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels in human lymphocytes, independent of blood pressure, are associated with a high risk of myocardial infarction (not stroke-risk, which is dependent on blood pressure). This has treatment implications in the young/middle-aged hypertensive subject. Antihypertensive agents that increase sympathetic nerve activity e.g. dihydropyridine calcium blockers, angiotensin receptor blockers, and thiazide-type diuretics, do not reduce (and may increase) the risk of myocardial infarction. Beta-1 blockade, effective in reversing and stabilising coronary atheromataous plaque, and with possible anti-tumor properties, is superior to ACE-inhibition, and is the treatment of choice in young/middle-aged hypertension with DM2.",

It occurs in 5% of patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc), particularly in patients with diffuse disease during the first years. SRC is more common in patients receiving corticosteroids, the risk increasing with increasing dose. The disease is sometimes triggered by use of nephrotoxic drugs and/or intravascular volume depletion. Left ventricular insufficiency and hypertensive encephalopathy are typical clinical features. Thrombotic microangiopathy is detected in 43% of cases, and anti-RNA-polymerase III antibodies are present in one-third of patients. Renal biopsy is not necessary if SRC presents classical features. However, biopsy may help to define the prognosis and guide treatment in atypical forms. The prognosis of SRC has greatly improved with the introduction of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. However, the 5-year survival for SSc patients with full SRC remains low (65%). The treatment of SRC relies on aggressive blood pressure control with an ACE inhibitor, combined with other antihypertensive drugs if needed.

The purpose of this research was to survey the diagnosis and treatment status of steroid-sensitive, relaping/steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome (SSNS, RNS/SDNS) in Chinese children and to evaluate the applicability and promotion of the evidence-based guideline on diagnosis and treatment of SSNS, RNS/SDNS (for trial implementation) conducted by The Subspecialty Group of Nephrology, the Society of Pediatrics, Chinese Medical Association in 2009.", 
    "281": "Questionnaires concerning children with SSNS, RNS/SDNS were designed by The Subspecialty Group of Nephrology, Society of Pediatrics, Chinese Medical Association and distributed to the doctors of 37 centers of 27 cities, 4 municipalities and 2 autonomous regions. A nationwide survey was conducted and data of hospitalized children (younger than 18 years of age) with SSNS, RNS/SDNS in 2008 and 2011 were analyzed retrospectively.",

The male to female ratio was 3.2: 1 and the median age was 4.1 years (Q = 4.2 years); 3 186 (85.5%) cases were diagnosed as simple NS and 539 (14.5%) as nephritic NS; 2 825 (75.8%) PNS cases were the first episode and 1 050 (28.2%) cases were the relapse; 221 (5.9%) cases were diagnosed as SDNS and 749 (20.1%) as frequently relapse NS (FRNS) . At NS diagnosis, the proteinuria was 3+-4+ (3 260 cases, 87.5%) , median quantitive proteinuria for 24 hours was 112.0 mg/kg (Q = 109.3 mg/kg) , mean plasma albumin was (17.9 \u00b1 6.4) g/L and mean cholesterol was (10.0 \u00b1 3.1) mmol/L. Oral prednisone 2 mg/(kg\u00b7d) was the main treatment of the first episode cases (92.8%, 2 622/2 825). The median time of proteinuria remission was 9 (6) days; 96.1% (2 714/2 825) cases reached complete remission in 4 weeks and 3.6% (101/2 825) in 4-8 weeks. The median time for using full dose corticosteroid (GC) was 31 days and total time for using GC was 10 months. Of 1 050 cases, 402 (38.3%) RNS and 33.6% (252/749) FR/SD cases were treated with full dose GC again. After different treatment regimens, 77.5% (814/1 050) RNS and 75.4% (565/749) FR/SDNS cases reached remission. The median time of proteinuria remission was 8 days. 53.7% (402/749) FR/SDNS were treated with immunosuppressant and the first choice was CTX 211 cases (52.5%) , then CsA 108 cases (26.9%), MMF 70 cases (17.4%) and FK506 40 cases(10.0%). The cases treated with ACEI accounted for 24.0% (894 cases),ARB and levamisole accounted for 0.8% (28 cases) and 2.8% (106 cases), respectively.", 
    "283": "In recent years, the proportion of children with PNS in the hospitalized childhood patients with urologic-kidney diseases was stable. The most common cases were the first episode, mainly in pre-school boys. The evidence-based guideline on diagnosis of SSNS, RNS/ SDNS (for trial implementation) conducted by The Subspecialty Group of Nephrology, Society of Pediatrics, Chinese Medical Association in 2009 was suitable for Chinese children with PNS, and remained to be further popularized. The guideline recommendation on treatment had a satisfactory recent curative outcome, and the long-term outcome needs further research.",

    "286": "Phase 1 was a case-control study to identify AKI risk factors among patients who underwent AIC placement. Cases experienced AKI; controls had unchanged renal function. Phase 2 was a retrospective cohort study. Patients who received \u226572 hours of intravenous (IV) vancomycin were divided into 2 groups according to whether they underwent vancomycin-AIC placement. Primary outcome was number of vancomycin dosing changes.", 
    "287": "Phase 1: Among 26 cases and 74 controls AKI risk factors on univariate and multivariable analysis included exposure to angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor exposure within 7 days of AIC placement (42% vs 20%, P = 0.03) and piperacillin-tazobactam within 7 days following AIC placement (31% vs 12%, P = 0.03). Phase 2: Among 53 patients who underwent vancomycin-AIC placement and 104 who underwent another surgery type, vancomycin was adjusted more frequently in patients who underwent vancomycin-AIC placement (28% vs 15%, P = 0.06).", 
    "288": "Among patients who undergo AIC placement with vancomycin and/or tobramycin, exposure to ACE inhibitors and piperacillin-tazobactam are associated with increased risk of AKI in the immediate postoperative period.

    "289": "The longer and neurotoxic species of amyloid-\u03b2 protein (A\u03b2), A\u03b242 and A\u03b243, contribute to A\u03b2 accumulation in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis and are considered to be the primary cause of the disease. In contrast, the predominant secreted form of A\u03b2, A\u03b240, inhibits amyloid deposition and may have neuroprotective effects. We have reported that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) converts A\u03b242 to A\u03b240 and that A\u03b243 is the earliest-depositing A\u03b2 species in the amyloid precursor protein transgenic mouse brain. Here we found that A\u03b243 can be converted to A\u03b242 and to A\u03b240 in mouse brain lysate. We further identified the brain A\u03b243-to-A\u03b242-converting enzyme as ACE2. The purified human ACE2 converted A\u03b243 to A\u03b242, and this activity was inhibited by a specific ACE2 inhibitor, DX600. Notably, the combination of ACE2 and ACE could convert A\u03b243 to A\u03b240. Our results indicate that the longer, neurotoxic forms of A\u03b2 can be converted to the shorter, less toxic or neuroprotective forms of A\u03b2 by ACE2 and ACE. Moreover, we found that ACE2 activity showed a tendency to decrease in the serum of AD patients compared with normal controls, suggesting an association between lower ACE2 activity and AD. Thus, maintaining brain ACE2 and ACE activities may be important for preventing brain amyloid neurotoxicity and deposition in Alzheimer's disease.", 
    "290": "Anemia is a common feature of diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) mainly due to erythropoietin (EPO) deficiency and uremic toxicity. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have been established as first-choice medications for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy. However, there are conflicting data regarding their impact on hemoglobin levels in patients with diabetic nephropathy. We evaluated the prevalence of anemia in 101 patients with diabetes mellitus type II and CKD at stage III-IV (group A) compared with 101 non-diabetic patients with similar renal function (group B). Moreover, we evaluated the impact of ACE inhibitors and ARBs on patients' anemia. Anemia was observed in 60 patients in group A and in 47 patients in group B (P < 0.01). Thirty-one (31) patients in group A and 19 patients in group B were receiving exogenous EPO for correction of renal anemia (P <0.05). Mean values of hemoglobin did not show significant differences (12.5 \u00b1 1.8 vs 12.6 \u00b1 1.7 g/dL) between the two groups. Seventy-five patients in group A and 52 patients in group B were receiving ACE inhibitors and/or ARBs (P <0.01), but, after multivariate analysis, we could not detect any association between anemia and the prescription of these medications. Anemia is more common in diabetic patients with CKD stage III-IV than in non-diabetic patients with similar renal function. Our results indicate that ACE inhibitors and ARBs are not a significant cause of anemia for both populations.", 
    "291": "Elevated serum levels of osteopontin have been associated with cardiovascular disease, diabetic nephropathy, and autoimmune disease activity. Aim of the study was to investigate the relationship between osteopontin serum levels and renal damage in a population of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Osteopontin serum levels were analyzed in 101 SLE patients and compared to those of 115 healthy controls. Associations between osteopontin levels and renal involvement, disease activity and damage index, biochemical parameters, and therapy were assessed. Overall osteopontin serum levels were higher in SLE patients (median, 17.93 ng/mL; interquartile range, 8.13-35.07 ng/mL) than in healthy controls (median, 5.62 ng/mL; interquartile range, 2.61-13.83 ng/mL). Univariate logistic analysis among cases showed that high osteopontin levels (higher vs medium-lower tertile) were associated with renal involvement (p\u2009=\u20090.012), renal function (p\u2009=\u20090.007), proteinuria (p\u2009=\u20090.011), anemia (p\u2009<\u20090.001), and SLICC/ACR Damage Index (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Multivariate analysis showed an independent association between high osteopontin serum levels (higher vs medium-lower tertile) and chronic kidney disease (OR\u2009=\u20094.89; 95 % CI, 1.24-19.24; p\u2009=\u20090.008), proteinuria (OR\u2009=\u20094.56; 95 % CI, 1.15-18.04; p\u2009=\u20090.027), anemia (OR\u2009=\u20094.66; 95 % CI, 1.25-17.43; p\u2009=\u20090.008), and use of renin-angiontensin system antagonists (OR\u2009=\u20090.234; 95 % CI, 0.06-0.98; p\u2009=\u20090.047). This study shows that elevated osteopontin serum levels significantly correlate with renal involvement and anemia in SLE. Moreover, it suggests that renin-angiontensin system antagonists decrease osteopontin levels-this effect is consistent with the inhibitory effect of these drugs on osteopontin renal expression, detected in animal models by other authors, and may provide a new rationale for their employment.", 
    "292": "Few studies have investigated whether angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) is a practical alternative to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) for long-term use after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in real-world practice in the percutaneous coronary intervention era. We compared 5-year survival benefits of ACEI and ARB in patients with AMI registered in the Osaka Acute Coronary Insufficiency Study. Study subjects were divided into 3 groups: ACEI (n\u00a0= 4,425), ARB (n\u00a0= 2,158), or patients without either drug (n\u00a0=\u00a02,442). A total of 661 deaths were recorded. Cox regression analysis revealed that treatment with either ACEI or ARB was associated with reduced 5-year mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.70, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.58 to 0.83, p <0.001 and HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.98, p\u00a0= 0.03, respectively). However, Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox regression analyses based on propensity score revealed that ACEI was associated with better survival than ARB from 2 to 5\u00a0years after survival discharge (adjusted HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.74, p <0.001). These findings were confirmed in a propensity score-matched population. In conclusion, treatment with ACEI was associated with better 5-year survival after AMI.",

    "295": "Aortic ACE, blood pressure, plasma phosphate, and parathyroid hormone were increased in the NX and NX+Pi groups, but were reduced with phosphate binding. Endothelium-mediated relaxations of isolated mesenteric conduit artery rings to acetylcholine were impaired in the NX and NX+Pi groups, but did not differ from sham in NX+Ca rats. Experiments with nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibition in vitro suggested that the NO-mediated component of acetylcholine response was lower in the NX and NX+Pi groups, but did not differ from sham in NX+Ca rats. In all NX groups, aortic endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) was reduced, while plasma and urine concentrations of NO metabolites were increased. Aortic nitrated proteins and calcification were increased in the NX and NX+Pi groups when compared with the NX+Ca and sham groups.", 
    "296": "Hypertension in the NX model of CRI was associated with reduced vasorelaxation, decreased eNOS, and increased ACE and nitrated proteins in the aorta. Phosphate binding with calcium carbonate enhanced vasorelaxation via endogenous NO and suppressed elevation of ACE and nitrated proteins, suggesting reduced vascular oxidative stress. Our findings support the view that correction of the calcium-phosphorus balance prevents CRI-induced vascular pathophysiology.", 
    "297": "High incidences of myocardial infarction associated with high morbidity and mortality, are a major concern and economic burden on industrialized nations. Persistent \u03b2-adrenergic receptor stimulation with isoproterenol leads to the development of oxidative stress, myocardial inflammation, thrombosis, platelet aggregation and calcium overload, which ultimately cause myocardial infarction. Therapeutic agents that are presently employed for the prevention and management of myocardial infarction are beta-blockers, antithrombotics, thrombolytics, statins, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers and nitrovasodilators. In spite of effective available interventions, the mortality rate of myocardial infarction is progressively increasing. Thus, there has been a regular need to develop effective therapies for the prevention and management of this insidious disease. In this review, the authors give an overview of the consequences of isoproterenol in the pathogenesis of cardiac disorders and various therapeutic possibilities to prevent these disorders.", 
    "298": "The mechanism of antihypertensive and lipid-lowering drugs on the human organism is still not fully understood. New insights on the drugs' action can be provided by a metabolomics-driven approach, which offers a detailed view of the physiological state of an organism. Here, we report a metabolome-wide association study with 295 metabolites in human serum from 1,762 participants of the KORA F4 (Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg) study population. Our intent was to find variations of metabolite concentrations related to the intake of various drug classes and--based on the associations found--to generate new hypotheses about on-target as well as off-target effects of these drugs. In total, we found 41 significant associations for the drug classes investigated: For beta-blockers (11 associations), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (four assoc.), diuretics (seven assoc.), statins (ten assoc.), and fibrates (nine assoc.) the top hits were pyroglutamine, phenylalanylphenylalanine, pseudouridine, 1-arachidonoylglycerophosphocholine, and 2-hydroxyisobutyrate, respectively. For beta-blockers we observed significant associations with metabolite concentrations that are indicative of drug side-effects, such as increased serotonin and decreased free fatty acid levels. Intake of ACE inhibitors and statins associated with metabolites that provide insight into the action of the drug itself on its target, such as an association of ACE inhibitors with des-Arg(9)-bradykinin and aspartylphenylalanine, a substrate and a product of the drug-inhibited ACE. The intake of statins which reduce blood cholesterol levels, resulted in changes in the concentration of metabolites of the biosynthesis as well as of the degradation of cholesterol. Fibrates showed the strongest association with 2-hydroxyisobutyrate which might be a breakdown product of fenofibrate and, thus, a possible marker for the degradation of this drug in the human organism. The analysis of diuretics showed a heterogeneous picture that is difficult to interpret. Taken together, our results provide a basis for a deeper functional understanding of the action and side-effects of antihypertensive and lipid-lowering drugs in the general population.",

The TheraDoc\u2122 Clinical Surveillance Software System, which monitors laboratory and medication data and fires alerts when patients have a sufficient increase in serum creatinine, was used for automated case detection. An increase in serum creatinine in the presence of an active medication order identified to potentially cause AKI triggered an alert, and drug-associated AKI was staged according to the RIFLE criteria. Data were analyzed by frequency and distribution of alert type by risk, injury, and failure.",

Based on the RIFLE criteria, there were 191, 70, and 44 residents who were classified as AKI risk, injury, and failure, respectively. The most common medication classes included in the AKI alerts were diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers (ACEIs/ARBs), and antibiotics.",

    "303": "We previously demonstrated that mice which overexpress human renin and angiotensinogen (R+A+) show enhanced cerebral damage in both in vivo and in vitro experimental ischemia models. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) counteracts the effects of angiotensin (Ang-II) by transforming it into Ang-(1-7), thus reducing the ligand for the AT1 receptor and increasing stimulation of the Mas receptor. Triple transgenic mice, SARA, which specifically overexpress ACE2 in neurons of R+A+ mice were used to study the role of ACE2 in ischemic stroke using oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) of brain slices as an in vitro model. We examined tissue swelling, the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and cell death in the cerebral cortex (CX) and the hippocampal CA1 region during OGD. Expression levels of NADPH oxidase (Nox) isoforms, Nox2 and Nox4 were measured using western blots. Results show that SARA mice and R+A+ mice treated with the Mas receptor agonist Ang-(1-7) had less swelling, cell death, and ROS production in CX and CA1 areas compared to those in R+A+ animals. Treatment of slices from SARA mice with the Mas antagonist A779 eliminated this protection. Finally, western blots revealed less Nox2 and Nox4 expression in SARA mice compared with R+A+ mice both before and after OGD. We suggest that reduced brain swelling and cell death observed in SARA animals exposed to OGD result from diminished ROS production coupled with lower expression of Nox isoforms. Thus, the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas receptor pathway plays a protective role in brain ischemic damage by counteracting the detrimental effects of Ang-II-induced ROS production.", 
    "304": "A novel liquid chromatographic method with tandem mass spectrometric detection (LC-MS/MS) for the determination of LCI699 was developed and validated with dynamic ranges of 0.0500-50.0 ng/mL and 1.00-1,000 ng/mL using 0.0500 mL and 0.100mL, respectively, of human plasma. LCI699 and the internal standard, [M+6]LCI699, were extracted from fortified human plasma via protein precipitation. After transfer or dilution of the supernatant followed by solvent evaporation and/or reconstitution, the extract was injected onto the LC-MS/MS system. Optimal chromatographic separation was achieved on an ACE C18 (50 mm \u00d7 4.6mm, 3 \u03bcm) column with 30% aqueous methanol (containing 0.5% acetic acid and 0.05% TFA) as the mobile phase run in isocratic at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The total analysis cycle time is approximately 3.5 min per injection. The addition of an ion-pair reagent, TFA (0.05%, v/v), to the mobile phases significantly improved the chromatographic retention and resolution of the analyte on silica based reversed-phase column. Although addition of TFA to the mobile phase suppresses the ESI signals of the analyte due to its ion-pairing characteristics in the gas phase of MS source, this negative impact was effectively alleviated by adding 0.5% acetic acid to the mobile phase. The current method was validated for sensitivity, selectivity, linearity, reproducibility, stability and recovery. For the low curve range (0.0500-50.0 ng/mL), the accuracy and precision for the LLOQs (0.0500 ng/mL) were -13.0 to 2.0% bias and 3.4-19.2% CV, respectively. For other QC samples (0.100, 6.00, 20.0 and 40.0 ng/mL), the precision ranged from 1.2 to 9.0% and from 3.8 to 8.8% CV, respectively, in the intra-day and inter-day evaluations. The accuracy ranged from -11.3 to 8.0% and -7.2 to 1.6% bias, respectively, in the intra-day and inter-day batches. For the high curve range (1.00-1,000 ng/mL), the accuracy and precision for the LLOQs (1.00 ng/mL) were 1.0-15.0% bias and 7.4-9.2% CV, respectively. For the other QC samples (3.00, 20.0, 200 and 750 ng/mL), the precision ranged from 0.8 to 7.0% and from 1.9 to 5.2% CV, respectively, in the intra-day and inter-day evaluations. The accuracy ranged from -2.5 to 4.0% and 0.7-1.0% bias, respectively, in the intra-day and inter-day batches. Additional assessments of incurred sample stability (ISS) and incurred sample reanalysis (ISR) were conducted to demonstrate the ruggedness and robustness of the assay method. The absence of adverse matrix effect and carryover was also demonstrated. The validated method was successfully used to support rapid turnaround human pharmacokinetic studies.",

A clear association was also observed between VVV of fasting glucose and increased risk of vascular events (P < 0.001; 2.70 [1.65-4.42]). HbA1c variability was positively associated with the risk of macrovascular events (P = 0.02 for trend), whereas glucose variability was associated with both macro- and microvascular events (P = 0.005 and P < 0.001 for trend, respectively).

We report the cases of 2 patients who presented with takotsubo cardiomyopathy and were subsequently found to have apical-variant hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, after the apical ballooning from the takotsubo cardiomyopathy had resolved. The first patient, a 43-year-old woman with a history of alcohol abuse, presented with shortness of breath, electrocardiographic and echocardiographic features consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy, and no significant coronary artery disease. An echocardiogram 2 weeks later revealed a normal left ventricular ejection fraction and newly apparent apical hypertrophy. The 2nd patient, a 70-year-old woman with pancreatitis, presented with chest pain, apical akinesis, and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 0.39, consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy. One month later, her left ventricular ejection fraction was normal; however, hypertrophy of the left ventricular apex was newly noted.

The association between long-term use of ARBs and ACE inhibitors and fracture requiring medical attention is limited. We conducted a population-based, retrospective cohort study with propensity score matching using administrative databases in Ontario, Canada, to examine the risk of osteoporosis-related fractures in hypertensive elderly treated with ARBs versus ACE inhibitors. We identified a cohort of newly treated hypertensive patients aged 66 years and older who initiated an ACE inhibitor from May 1, 2004, to March 31, 2012, and matched them to ARB users on propensity score, sex, and age at drug initiation. The primary outcome was hip fracture, and secondary outcomes were non-hip major osteoporotic fractures (other femoral, clinical vertebral, forearm, wrist, humerus) and other osteoporotic fractures (pelvis, clavicle, patella, shoulder, upper arm, tibia, fibula, ankle, scapula, ribs, sternum, trunk). We calculated hazard ratios (HRs) using Cox proportional hazards model with robust standard errors. Of the 87,635 patients who initiated treatment, 28,819 (32.9%) started ARBs and 58,816 (67.1%) started ACE inhibitors.

A serum investigation suggested lupus nephritis and a renal biopsy, performed 2 weeks after the first proteinuria detection, revealed membranous lupus nephritis. We decided to perform ten sessions of daily immunoadsorption. Proteinuria decreased significantly over these ten sessions from 8 to 0.12 g/l. After the tenth immunoadsorption session, the patient received the first rituximab (RTX) infusion leading to complete B-cell depletion. The patient was maintained on ACEi associated with mycophenolic acid and hydroxychloroquine. Three RTX reinjections were performed when CD19-positive cells reappeared in peripheral blood.

The analysis results prove to be valid for analysis of the two active ingredients in raw materials and pharmaceutical dosage form through handling UV spectral data in range (220-350 nm). For proper analysis a 4 factor 4 level experimental design was established resulting in a training set consisting of 16 mixtures containing different ratios of interfering species. An independent test set consisting of 8 mixtures was used to validate the prediction ability of the suggested models. The results presented indicate the ability of mentioned multivariate calibration models to analyze HCZ and BZ in presence of HCZ impurities CT and DSA with high selectivity and accuracy of mean percentage recoveries of (101.01\u00b10.80) and (100.01\u00b10.87) for HCZ and BZ respectively using PLSR model and of (99.78\u00b10.80) and (99.85\u00b11.08) for HCZ and BZ respectively using SVR model. The analysis results of the dosage form were statistically compared to the reference HPLC method with no significant differences regarding accuracy and precision.

Contemporaneous guidelines provided clear recommendations regarding selection of patients for CRT, including that all patients should first receive GDMT with \u03b2 blockers and renin-angiotensin axis antagonists. Prevalence of GDMT among real-world patients receiving CRT defibrillators (CRT-D) has not been well studied. We identified 45,392 patients in the National Cardiovascular Data Registry Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator Registry who underwent first CRT-D implantation for primary prevention of sudden death from January 2006 to June 2008. We calculated the proportion of patients with contemporaneous class I guideline indications for CRT-D, the proportion receiving GDMT for heart failure, and the proportion receiving GDMT who had class I guideline indications for CRT-D. Among patients without contraindications, 87% were prescribed \u03b2 blockers, 78% an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor inhibitor, and 70% both a \u03b2 blocker and an angiotensin-converting enzyme or angiotensin II receptor inhibitor at discharge. Finally, 50% of patients met class I guideline indications and were prescribed GDMT at discharge; 9% neither met class I indications nor were prescribed GDMT at discharge. The major limitation of this study is the lack of dosage information in the Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator Registry and lack of prescribing information at times other than discharge. In conclusion, many patients receiving CRT-D are not receiving GDMT at discharge. Ensuring that all patients receiving CRT-D are also receiving GDMT appears to be a quality improvement target.", 
    "337": "While it is well known that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) plays an important role in blood pressure control, ACE also has effects on renal function, hematopoiesis, reproduction, and aspects of the immune response. ACE 10/10 mice overexpress ACE in myelomonocytic cells. Macrophages from these mice have an increased polarization towards a pro-inflammatory phenotype that results in a very effective immune response to challenge by tumors or bacterial infection. In a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the ACE 10/10 phenotype provides significant protection against AD pathology, including reduced inflammation, reduced burden of the neurotoxic amyloid-\u03b2 protein and preserved cognitive function. Taken together, these studies show that increased myelomonocytic ACE expression in mice alters the immune response to better defend against many different types of pathologic insult, including the cognitive decline observed in an animal model of AD.", 
    "338": "Enalapril maleate (EM) is unstable in poorly designed tablet formulations. To improve the stability of EM, the degradation mechanism should be elucidated. In this study, we found that several commonly used excipients promoted the degradants of EM, particularly a diketopiperazine derivative (DKP). We propose two degradation pathways in which both acid and alkali can promote the formation of DKP, although previous reports suggested that DKP is produced mainly in acidic media. Based on the degradation pathways, we believe that subtle control of the microenvironmental pH can inhibit the formation of DKP. This was confirmed by the observation that the degradation rate became slower when certain organic acids were added to the binary mixtures of EM and excipient. The data showed that the stability of EM in the ternary mixtures was much higher than that in binary mixtures. It was further proved that tablets containing these organic acids produced less DKP after the accelerated test. We also found that the formation of DKP in tablets varied with different ratios of tartaric acid, which was used as a model organic acid. This illustrated that an optimum ratio of tartaric acid is required. These results indicated that the stability of EM in tablet formulation is closely associated with microenvironmental pH and the addition of a suitable organic acid based on the reaction mechanism is an effective strategy for improving the stability of EM.", 
    "339": "Although primary chronic hypertension (HTN) is increasingly common in adolescence, secondary forms of HTN are more common among children. Primary HTN is associated with being overweight and/or a positive family history of HTN. Carotid intima-media thickness, a known risk factor for atherosclerosis is frequent in both adults and children with HTN and other associated cardiovascular (CV) risk factors including obesity, dyslipidemia, diabetes and chronic kidney disease. Left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy is also a common finding in children and adolescents with newly diagnosed HTN. Children with certain medical conditions such as congenital heart disease and Kawasaki disease can develop premature atherosclerosis heart disease that may lead to coronary heart disease and heart failure. Life-style interventions are recommended for all children with HTN, with pharmacologic therapy added for symptomatic children based on the presence of co-morbidities. As an example, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blocker and/or calcium channel blockers would be best for children with CV risk factors such as diabetes or renal disease, whereas an ACE inhibitor in combination with a beta-blocker and diuretics including spironolactone are recommended for patients with heart failure and reduced LV ejection fraction. This report will summarize new developments in the management of pediatric HTN complicated with CV disease and heart failure and will address the appropriate antihypertensive therapy that could potentially reduce the future burden of adult CV disease.",

No method was available for simultaneous determination of both drugs in urine. A novel sensitive method for simultaneous quantification in undiluted human urine was developed which enables systematic pharmacokinetic investigations, especially in poorly investigated populations like children. Matrix effects were clearly reduced by applying solid-phase extraction followed by a chromatographic separation on Xselect(TM) C18 CSH columns. Mobile phase consisted of methanol and water, both acidified with formic acid. Under gradient conditions and a flow rate of 0.4\u2009mL/min the column effluent was monitored by tandem mass spectrometry with electrospray ionization.

    "342": "Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is an age-dependent atherosclerotic disorder associated with an increased prevalence of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Approximately 35% of patients with PAD complain of lower extremity claudication, which may worsen to impair daily function. ACE inhibitors may possess vasoactive properties that improve symptoms of claudication. We designed a meta-analysis to quantify the effectiveness of ACE inhibitors on walking capacities in patients with lower extremity PAD. We reviewed MEDLINE and Cochrane databases from 1966 to 2013, in addition to relevant bibliographies to obtain our clinical trials. From the original findings, 4 randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind studies qualified for inclusion. Using a random-effects model, ACE inhibitors were associated with an increase of 126 m [95% confidence interval (CI), -95 to 346] (P = 0.264) in maximal walking distance and a rise in Ankle-Brachial Index of 0.09 (95% CI, 0.024-0.205) (P = 0.12). However, pain-free walking distance was significantly increased by 86 m (95% CI, 13-156) (P = 0.021). Contradictions in study outcomes between more recent and earlier trials of ACE inhibitors in claudication impeded the interpretation of effectiveness. Early trials failed to demonstrate improvement in walking capacities, possibly because of omissions in patient enrollment criteria and inadequate sample size. Recent guidelines recommend consideration of ACE inhibitors in patients with PAD for cardioprotective effects. Although ACE inhibitors were well tolerated, vigilance for clinical predictors of renal arterial stenosis and renal instability after initiation will ensure safe administration in all patients with PAD.", 
    "343": "It was previously demonstrated that metabolic syndrome in humans is associated with an impairment of insulin signalling in circulating mononuclear cells. At least in animal models of hypertension, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) may correct alterations of insulin signalling in the skeletal muscle. In the first study, we investigated the effects of a 3-month treatment with an ARB with additional PPAR\u03b3 agonist activity, telmisartan, or with a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, nifedipine, on insulin signalling in patients with mild-moderate essential hypertension. Insulin signalling was evaluated in mononuclear cells by isolating them through Ficoll-Paque density gradient centrifugation and protein analysis by Western Blot. An increased expression of mTOR and of phosphorylated (active) mTOR (p-mTOR) was observed in patients treated with telmisartan, but not in those treated with nifedipine, while both treatments increased the cellular expression of glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT-4). We also investigated the effects of antihypertensive treatment with two drug combinations on insulin signalling and oxidative stress. Twenty essential hypertensive patients were included in the study and treated for 4 weeks with lercanidipine. Then they were treated for 6 months with lercanidipine + enalapril or lercanidipine + hydrochlorothiazide. An increased expression of insulin receptor, GLUT-4 and an increased activation of p70S6K1 were observed during treatment with lercanidipine + enalapril but not with lercanidipine + hydrochlorothiazide. In conclusion, telmisartan and nifedipine are both effective in improving insulin signalling in human hypertension; however, telmisartan seems to have broader effects. The combination treatment lercanidipine + enalapril seems to be more effective than lercanidipine + hydrochlorothiazide in activating insulin signalling in human lympho-monocytes.",

However, with VEGF inhibitors (VEGFIs) are new complications, particularly hypertension. VEGFI-induced hypertension is a dose-dependent phenomenon due to on-target effects rather than off-target effects. Increased blood pressure occurs in almost 100% of patients who take VEGFIs, with a subset who develop severe hypertension. Molecular mechanisms underlying VEGFI-induced hypertension are unclear, but endothelial dysfunction and increased vascular resistance, due to impaired nitric oxide signalling, reduced prostacyclin production, endothelin-1 (ET-1) upregulation, oxidative stress, and rarefaction have been implicated. Treatment of hypertension should be aimed at reducing the risk of short-term morbidity associated with hypertension while maintaining effective dosing of antiangiogenic therapy for optimal cancer treatment. Although specific guidelines are not yet available for the management of VEGFI-induced hypertension, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are commonly used. Severe hypertension might require reduction of VEGFI dosing, or in some cases, interruption of treatment. As more potent VEGFIs are developed and as more cancer patients are treated with VEGFIs, the burden of hypertension toxicity will increase. This will be further compounded as the use of antiangiogenic drugs broadens to include older patients and those with pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Here we focus on VEGF as a target for antiangiogenesis and how this affects increased blood pressure. Putative mechanisms underlying VEGFI-induced hypertension are highlighted and therapeutic strategies to manage such hypertension are discussed.",

What was once thought to be an endemic disease of high income countries has become a global epidemic, as low and middle income countries have adopted Western lifestyles, to the point that noncommunicable diseases are now the main cause of death in these regions, above and beyond communicable diseases, malnutrition, and injury. As a result, a large proportion of individuals at high 10-year risk of a cardiovascular event live in low- and middle-income countries, and the most of all cardiovascular events occur in developing countries. A large amount of evidence supports the use of pharmacological treatment for the prevention of cardiovascular death in this population, including antiplatelet drugs, \u03b2-blockers, lipid-lowering agents, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, however, the efficacy of cardiovascular event prevention is hampered by several problems, including inadequate prescription of medication, poor adherence to treatment, limited availability of medications, and unaffordable cost of treatment. Here we examine the use of fixed-dose combination therapy, and how this therapy could improve adherence to treatment, reduce the cost, and improve treatment affordability in low-income countries.",

Selected reaction monitoring (SRM) with heated electrospray ionization (HESI) was used in the positive mode for mass spectrometric detection. Analytes and ISs were extracted from plasma by simple protein precipitation. The reconstituted samples were chromatographed on a C18 (100 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 microm) column with mixture of methanol-acetonitrile-5 mmol.L- ammonium acetate-formic acid (30 : 30 : 40 : 0.1) as mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.6 mL.min-1. The standard curves were demonstrated to be linear in the range of 0.02 to 6.00 ng.mL-1 for amlodipine, 0.2 to 1,500 ng.mL-1 for benazepril and benazeprilat with r2>0.99 for each analyte. The lower limit of quantitation was identifiable and reproducible at 0.02, 0.2 and 0.2 ng mL-1 for amlodipine, benazepril and benazeprilat, respectively. The intra-day and inter-day precision and accuracy results were within the acceptable limit across all concentrations.

MicroRNA let-7 exhibits anti-EndMT effects and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor has been shown to be an important in microRNA let-7 expression. The endogenous antifibrotic peptide N-acetyl-seryl-aspartyl-lysyl-proline (AcSDKP) is a substrate of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Here, we found that AcSDKP inhibited the EndMT and exhibited fibrotic effects that were associated with FGF receptor-mediated anti-fibrotic program. Conventional ACE inhibitor plus AcSDKP ameliorated kidney fibrosis and inhibited EndMT compared to therapy with the ACE inhibitor alone in diabetic CD-1 mice. The endogenous AcSDKP levels were suppressed in diabetic animals. Cytokines induced cultured endothelial cells into EndMT; coincubation with AcSDKP inhibited EndMT. Expression of microRNA let-7 family was suppressed in the diabetic kidney; antifibrotic and anti-EndMT effects of AcSDKP were associated with the restoration of microRNA let-7 levels. AcSDKP restored diabetes- or cytokines-suppressed FGF receptor expression/phosphorylation into normal levels both in vivo and in vitro. These results suggest that AcSDKP is an endogenous antifibrotic molecule that has the potential to cure diabetic kidney fibrosis via an inhibition of the EndMT associated with the restoration of FGF receptor and microRNA let-7.",

We assayed the levels of urea nitrogen, urine glucose, creatinine, and protein, Ace2, Ace, angiotensin II type 1 receptor (At1) and Mas receptor mRNA, and renal and plasma angiotensin II (Ang II) in STZ-treated and untreated rats. We also used histology and immunohistochemistry to assess glomerular injury and ACE2 glomerular and cortical expression. The amounts of urea nitrogen, urine glucose, creatinine, and protein were significantly higher in STZ-treated rats than in control rats (P < 0.01). There were significant pathological changes in the kidney upon STZ-treatment. Ace2 and Ace mRNA levels were significantly higher in STZ-treated rats than in control rats (P < 0.05 and P = 0.05, respectively). There was no significant difference in the Mas receptor and At1 mRNA levels in the 2 groups, although At1 levels showed an increase upon STZ-treatment. The Ang II level in the renal cortical tissue and plasma of STZ-treated rats was higher than that of control rats (P < 0.05). The increase in Ace mRNA levels was higher than that of Ace2 mRNA levels, leading to an elevated Ace/Ace2 ratio. Together, these data suggest that the ACE-Ang II-AT1 axis is the dominant axis in severe kidney injury.",

Hypertension is prevalent in this cohort, and control of blood pressure is perhaps the most important risk factor to reduce CKD progression. The most recent blood pressure target recommended by the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes and Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guideline committees is\u00a0less than\u00a0140/90\u00a0mmHg for all patients with CKD. There is some evidence for those with 1 g or more of albuminuria, albeit weak, to support a blood pressure target of less than 130/80\u00a0mmHg. Multiple studies demonstrate that renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockers are important in reducing cardiovascular risk and progression of CKD in those with advanced proteinuric nephropathy. However, there is no evidence that they prevent nephropathy or that reduction in microalbuminuria alone is associated with slowed nephropathy progression. The purpose of this article is to review the major studies that have evaluated cardiovascular and kidney endpoints in patients with diabetes and the role of RAAS blockers in the treatment of this disease.", 
    "362": "The objective of the current study was to search for genetic determinants associated with antihypertensive effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril. Linkage and correlation analyses of captopril-induced effects on blood pressure (BP) with renal transcriptome were performed in the BXH/HXB recombinant inbred (RI) strains derived from spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) and Brown Norway (BN-Lx) progenitors. Variability of blood pressure lowering effects of captopril among RI strains was continuous suggesting a polygenic mode of inheritance. Linkage analysis of captopril-induced BP effects revealed a significant quantitative trait locus (QTL) on chromosome 15. This QTL colocalized with cis regulated expression QTL (eQTL) for the Ednrb (endothelin receptor type B) gene in the kidney (SHR allele was associated with increased renal expression) and renal expression of Ednrb correlated with captopril-induced BP effects. These results suggest that blood pressure lowering effects of ACE inhibitor captopril may be modulated by the variants at the Ednrb locus.",

The main aim of the study was to carry out the analysis of general practitioners (GP) prescription of evidence-based therapy in patients after myocardial infarction (MI). Data were retrospectively collected in 2011, by a single application with the help of software that GPs use in their surgeries. All patients of a particular GP who had MI in their history and who were at the time of data collection treated only by GPs (not by the specialists of internal medicine or cardiology) were always included. Four hundred ninety one patients were included in the study. The average age was 70.7 (+/- 11.6) and 69.2% of the involved patients were men. Seventy nine percent of patients used beta-blockers, 80% antiplatelet drugs, 77% statins and 79% used angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ACEIs/ARBs). Forty four percent of patients used drugs from all four groups. The significant prescription decrease was proved in all four groups in dependence on patients' age (p < 0.05). Although the evidence-based medicine usage in patients after MI in the Czech Republic is comparable to other countries, it is not optimal. More intensive involvement of pharmacists in the care of patients after MI would further improve the situation.",

The emulsion diffusion solvent evaporation method was employed for preparation of microspheres using Eudragit E100. Glycerol monostearate and sodium lauryl sulfate were used as surfactants, which showed good effect of film integrity. The different proportion of Eudragit E100 and ramipril at varying speed were employed for formulating hollow microspheres using 3(2) full factorial design. The formulated microspheres were subjected to evaluation of various parameters such as particle size analysis using motic microscope, drug loading efficiency and in vitro drug release. The main effect plot showed negative impact of polymer concentration and drug complex concentration, whereas positive impact of rotation speed on the % release of drug and drug encapsulation efficiency. The optimized batch of microcapsules was formulated as a hard gelatine capsule dosage form containing loading (plain drug) as well as sustained fraction of drug in form of microcapsules. It was found that dosage form also showed good in vitro release profile.",

This study investigates whether HETM can affect embryonic development when administered during the one-cell-blastocyst period. Pregnant Wistar rats received orally the HETM (3, 30, and 300\u2009mg/kg/day) from the 1st to the 7th gestational day. Rats were killed on the 8th day of pregnancy and the following parameters were evaluated: clinical symptoms of toxicity (including organ weights), number of corpora lutea, implants per group, preimplantation losses ratio, and the serum levels of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), estradiol, and progesterone. No clinical symptoms of maternal toxicity were evidenced. On the 8th day of pregnancy, the levels of DHEA and estradiol were increased and significant preimplantation losses were observed at all doses used. The present study reveals that the HETM can raise levels of DHEA and estradiol and induce difficulty in the embryo implantation in the early stages of pregnancy. The data contributes significantly to the safety aspects of using this natural product when trying to get pregnant or during pregnancy.", 
    "366": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has pivotal roles in the regulation of normal physiology and the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2, and its product angiotensin 1-7, are thought to have counteracting effects against the adverse actions of other, better known and understood, members of the RAS. The physiological and pathological importance of ACE2 and angiotensin 1-7 in the cardiovascular system are not completely understood, but numerous experimental studies have indicated that these components have protective effects in the heart and blood vessels. Here, we provide an overview on the basic properties of ACE2 and angiotensin 1-7 and a summary of the evidence from experimental and clinical studies of various pathological conditions, such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, myocardial remodelling, heart failure, ischaemic stroke, and diabetes mellitus. ACE2-mediated catabolism of angiotensin II is likely to have a major role in cardiovascular protection, whereas the relevant functions and signalling mechanisms of actions induced by angiotensin 1-7 have not been conclusively determined. The ACE2-angiotensin 1-7 pathway, however, might provide a useful therapeutic target for the treatment of cardiovascular disease, especially in patients with overactive RAS.",

There is experimental and clinical evidence from animal and human studies that suggests a role for the renin angiotensin system (RAS) in the etiopathogenesis of AF. This review appraises the current understanding of RAS antagonism, using angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) and aldosterone antagonists (AA), for prevention of AF. RAS antagonism has proven to be effective for primary and secondary prevention of AF in subjects with heart failure and left ventricular (LV) dysfunction.However, most of the evidence for the protective effect of RAS antagonism is from clinical trials that had AF as a secondary outcome or from unspecified post-hoc analyses. The evidence for prevention in subjects without heart failure and with normal LV function is not as clear. RAS antagonism, in the absence of concomitant antiarrhythmic therapy, was not shown to reduce post cardioversion AF recurrences. RAS antagonism in subjects undergoing catheter ablation has also been ineffective in preventing AF recurrences.",

    "385": "The title of this contribution on Immunology at Stanford is purposely ambiguous. One goal is the development of safe and effective therapy for autoimmune diseases. Another definition of goal is to score, and this would ultimately mean the development of an approved drug. Indeed, the efforts in my four decades at Stanford, have included the discovery and subsequent development of a monoclonal antibody to block homing to the inflamed brain, leading to natalizumab, an approved therapeutic for two autoimmune diseases: relapsing-remitting MS and for inflammatory bowel disease. Multiple attempts to develop new therapies for autoimmune disease are described here: The trimolecular complex and the immune synapse serve as one major set of targets, with attempts to inhibit particular major histocompatibility molecules, the variable regions of the T cell receptor, and CD4. Other approaches focusing on antigen-specific tolerance include ongoing attempts with tolerizing DNA vaccines in type 1 diabetes. Finally, the repurposing of popular drugs approved for other indications, including statins and inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme is under development and showing promise in the clinic, particularly for secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. The milieu within Stanford Immunology has helped to nurture these efforts to translate discoveries in immunology and to take them from bench to bedside.",

The separation was carried out on HPTLC silica gel 60 F254 using ethyl acetate-methanol-glacial acetic acid (85:2:0.3 v/v/v) followed by densitometric measurement of bands at 240 nm for the first mixture containing HCZ, CT, DSA, BZ and by using ethyl acetate-methanol-water-ammonia (90:10:5:3 v/v/v) followed by densitometric measurement at 278 nm for the second mixture containing HCZ, CT, DSA, AM. Calibration curves were constructed in the range of (0.2-1.8 \u00b5g/band) and (0.4-2.2 \u00b5g/band) with good accuracy for HCZ and BZ, respectively, for the first mixture and in the range of (0.6-1.8 \u00b5g/band) and (0.4-2.4 \u00b5g/band) with good accuracy for HCZ and AM, respectively, for the second mixture. The developed method was validated according to ICH guidelines and demonstrated good accuracy and precision. Moreover, the methods were successfully applied for the determination of HCZ and BZ and AM in pure form and pharmaceutical dosage forms.

However, WYT (IC50 = 0.054 mM) and SVYT (IC50 = 0.063 mM) had similar renin-inhibitory activity, which was significantly better than that of IPAGV (IC50 = 0.093 mM). Kinetics studies showed that WVYY had a lower inhibition constant (Ki) of 0.06 mM and hence greater affinity for ACE when compared to the 1.83 mM obtained for WYT. SVYT had lowest Ki value of 0.89 mM against renin, when compared to the values obtained for WYT and IPAGV. Molecular docking results showed that the higher inhibitory activities of WVYY and SVYT were due to the greater degree of noncovalent bond-based interactions with the enzyme protein, especially formation of higher numbers of hydrogen bonds with active site residues.",

Goby protein hydrolysates (GPHs) are rich in Gly and Thr, which accounted for 14.1-15% and 11.6-13.2% of the total amino acids, respectively. The antioxidant activities of GPHs were investigated by using several in vitro assay systems. All GPHs exhibited significant metal chelating activity and DPPH free radical-scavenging activity, and inhibited linoleic acid peroxidation. For the ACE-inhibitory activity, as the DH increased, the activity of GPHs increased. The obtained results revealed that antioxidant and ACE-inhibitory activities of GPHs were influenced by the degree of hydrolysis. A medium degree of enzymatic hydrolysis was appropriate to obtain GPHs with good antioxidant activity, while small peptides were essential to obtain high ACE inhibitory activity.", 
    "390": "The plasma pool of potassium is a partial reflection of the overall body, transient cellular shifts, and potassium elimination regulated by the kidneys. Potassium concentrations elevating above the upper limit of normal (> 5.0 mEq/L) have become more common in cardiovascular practice due to the growing population of patients with chronic kidney disease and the broad applications of drugs that modulate potassium excretion by either reducing production of angiotensin II (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, direct renin inhibitors, beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists), blocking angiotensin II receptors (angiotensin receptor blockers), or antagonizing the action of aldosterone on mineralocorticoid receptors (mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists). In addition, acute kidney injury, critical illness, crush injuries, and massive red blood cell transfusions can result in hyperkalemia. Progressively more severe elevations in potassium are responsible for abnormalities in cardiac depolarization and repolarization and contractility. Untreated severe hyperkalemia results in sudden cardiac death. Traditional management steps have included reducing dietary potassium and discontinuing potassium supplements; withdrawal of exacerbating drugs; acute treatment with intravenous calcium gluconate, insulin, and glucose; nebulized albuterol; correction of acidosis with sodium bicarbonate for short-term shifts out of the plasma pool; and, finally, gastrointestinal ion exchange with oral sodium polystyrene sulfonate in sorbitol, which is mainly used in the hospital and is poorly tolerated due to gastrointestinal adverse effects. This review explores hyperkalemia as a complication in cardiovascular patients and highlights new acute, chronic, and preventative oral therapies (patiromer calcium, cross-linked polyelectrolyte, ZS-9) that could potentially create a greater margin of safety for vulnerable patients with combined heart and kidney disease.",

We examined whether this reversible redox modification plays a role in angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced endothelial dysfunction.", 
    "408": "Ang II increased eNOS glutathionylation in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), rabbit aorta, and human arteries in vitro. This was associated with decreased NO bioavailability and eNOS activity as well as increased O2(\u2022-) generation. Ang II-induced decrease in eNOS activity was mediated by glutathionylation, as shown by restoration of function by glutaredoxin-1. Moreover, Ang II-induced increase in O2(\u2022-) and decrease in NO were abolished in HUVECs transiently transfected, with mutant eNOS rendered resistant to glutathionylation. Ang II effects were nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase dependent because preincubation with gp 91ds-tat, an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase, abolished the increase in eNOS glutathionylation and loss of eNOS activity. Functional significance of glutathionylation in intact vessels was supported by Ang II-induced impairment of endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation that was abolished by the disulfide reducing agent, dithiothreitol. Furthermore, attenuation of Ang II signaling in vivo by administration of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor reduced eNOS glutathionylation, increased NO, diminished O2(\u2022-), improved endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation and reduced blood pressure.", 
    "409": "Uncoupling of eNOS by glutathionylation is a key mediator of Ang II-induced endothelial dysfunction, and its reversal is a mechanism for cardiovascular protection by ACE inhibition. We suggest that Ang II-induced O2(\u2022-) generation in endothelial cells, although dependent on NADPH oxidase, is amplified by glutathionylation-dependent eNOS uncoupling.",

Mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF), human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC) and SA-NH mouse sarcoma cells were exposed to 4 Gy in vitro. C3H mice were exposed to 7 Gy and evaluated utilizing an endogenous spleen colony assay system. Amifostine and WR1065, administered 30 min prior to irradiation, were used as positive controls. Treatment of MEF, HMEC and SA-NH cells with metformin elevated survival levels by 1.4-, 1.5- and 1.3-fold compared to 1.9-, 1.8- and 1.6-fold for these same cells treated with WR1065, respectively. Metformin (250 mg/kg) was effective in protecting splenic cells from a 7 Gy dose in vivo (protection factor = 1.8). Amifostine (400 mg/kg), administered 30 min prior to irradiation resulted in a 2.6-fold survival elevation, while metformin administered 24 h after irradiation in combination with NAC (400 mg/kg), MESNA (300 mg/kg) or captopril (200 mg/kg) enhanced survival by 2.6-, 2.8- and 2.4-fold, respectively. Each of these agents has been approved by the FDA for human use and each has a well characterized human safety profile. Metformin alone or in combination with selected sulfhydryl agents possesses radioprotective properties when administered 24 h after radiation exposure comparable to that observed for amifostine administered 30 min prior to irradiation making it a potentially useful agent for radiation countermeasures use.",

Three antihypertensive drugs, i.e. enalapril maleate, irbesartan and verapamil HCl, that have been shown to possess IOP-lowering activity were selected for this study. All three drugs displayed Bs-type phase-solubility diagrams in aqueous \u03b3CD solutions and had relatively low affinity for \u03b3CD. Irbesartan was selected for further formulation development. The drug was relatively stable at pH 4.5 but somewhat less stable at physiologic pH. However, presence of \u03b3CD in the aqueous media enhanced the chemical stability of irbesartan. Aqueous \u03b3CD-based eye drop formulations containing 1% and 2% (w/v) irbesartan were prepared and the effect of pH on the particles size distribution and drug release investigated. Only \u223c2% of the drug was in solution in the pH 4.5 formulations but up to 45% in the pH 7 formulations. The pH 7 formulations, where larger fraction of the drug was in solution, displayed somewhat greater drug permeation flux but much lower drug permeation coefficients than the pH 4.5 formulations. Dynamic light scattering studies indicated the faster permeation was due to formation of smaller particles in presence tyloxapol.", 
    "412": "Despite improved prognosis in patients with heart failure (HF) treated with neurohumoral activation-suppressing drugs (such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists, aldosterone receptor antagonists), mortality from heart failure remains high, myocardial contractile dysfunction progresses, and the left ventricle becomes enlarged. This leads to the need to elaborate novel approaches to treating HF. The latter is obviously due to impaired myocardial energy substrate metabolism. The mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are numerous and complex. These include reduced myocardial expression and activity of key free fatty acid oxidative enzymes. The expression of these enzymes is controlled by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors-alpha (PPAR-alpha). Thus, PPAR-alpha activation is a direct method to regulate myocardial fatty acid metabolism. Evidence for the efficiency of therapeutic strategies based on the fact that fatty acid metabolism may be modulated is controversial, which indicates that there may be more complex molecular/biochemical changes than supposed before. The data available in the literature suggest the promises of the above strategy and its serious therapeutic potential.",

This review compares the available clinical evidence from the BP-lowering and CV-outcome studies of telmisartan and perindopril, which are among the most intensively studied members of their respective classes. The PubMed database was searched for telmisartan and perindopril publications meeting the following criteria: 1) head-to-head comparison trials for BP lowering; and 2) CV-outcome studies (ie, ones with a CV event, mortality, or hospitalization outcome) in patients with CV risk factors but without heart failure. In comparative trials, telmisartan treatment resulted in significantly higher reduction in trough BP and mean ambulatory diastolic BP for the last 8 hours of the dosing interval compared with perindopril. In mainly placebo-controlled CV-outcome studies in patients with hypertension, CV benefits with perindopril were associated with large reductions in BP. There were no CV outcome studies with telmisartan in patients with hypertension. The beyond-BP-lowering CV-protective benefits of telmisartan were demonstrated in the active-controlled ONTARGET (ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial) trial, which included patients with controlled BP at baseline. In general, the trials discussed in this review reinforce the fact that perindopril and telmisartan are two long-acting antihypertensive drugs that reduce BP over 24 hours, and are the best-evidenced drugs in their class with proven CV protection. It is also clear that the benefits are not a \"class effect\", and vary between the different drugs within each class. Hence, the best approach for treatments tailored to individual patient needs should be evidence-based specific drugs, rather than a drug-class recommendation for achieving therapeutic targets.", 
    "444": "This study aims to investigate the effects of ramipril (RPL) on endothelial dysfunction associated with diabetes mellitus using cultured human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) and a type 2 diabetic animal model. The effect of RPL on vasodilatory function in fat-fed, streptozotocin-treated rats was assessed. RPL treatment of 8 weeks alleviated insulin resistance and inhibited the decrease in endothelium-dependent vasodilation in diabetic rats. RPL treatment also reduced serum advanced glycation end products (AGE) concentration and rat aorta reactive oxygen species formation and increased aorta endothelium heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression. Exposure of HAECs to high concentrations of glucose induced prolonged oxidative stress, apoptosis, and accumulation of AGEs. These effects were abolished by incubation of ramiprilat (RPT), the active metabolite of RPL. However, treatment of HAECs with STO-609, a CaMKK\u03b2 (Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase-\u03b2) inhibitor; compound C, an AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) inhibitor; and Zn(II)PPIX, a selective HO-1 inhibitor, blocked these beneficial effects of RPT. In addition, RPT increased nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor-2 (Nrf-2) nuclear translocation and activation in a CaMKK\u03b2/AMPK pathway-dependent manner, leading to increased expression of the Nrf-2-regulated antioxidant enzyme, HO-1. The inhibition of CaMKK\u03b2 or AMPK by pharmaceutical approach ablated RPT-induced HO-1 expression. Taken together, RPL ameliorates insulin resistance and endothelial dysfunction in diabetes via reducing oxidative stress. These effects are mediated by RPL activation of CaMKK-\u03b2, which in turn activates the AMPK-Nrf-2-HO-1 pathway for enhanced endothelial function.",

IDEAL was a cross-over, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, involving four 4-week periods: indapamide, perindopril and two placebo. Eligible patients were untreated, hypertensive and aged 25-70 years. The main outcome was systolic BP (SBP) response to drugs. The 112 participants with good compliance had a mean age of 52. One in every three participants was a woman. In middle-aged women, the SBP reduction from drugs was -11.5\u2009mm\u2009Hg (indapamide) and -8.3\u2009mm\u2009Hg (perindopril). In men, the response was significantly smaller: -4.8\u2009mm\u2009Hg (indapamide) and -4.3 (perindopril) (P for sex differences 0.001 and 0.015, respectively). SBP response to perindopril decreased by 2\u2009mm\u2009Hg every 10 years of age in both sexes (P=0.01). The response to indapamide increased by 3\u2009mm\u2009Hg every 10 years of age gradient in women (P=0.02).

VVV of SBP was calculated across 5 to 7 visits occurring 6 to 28 months following randomization. The standard deviation (SD) of SBP was 10.6 (SD=5.0), 10.5 (SD=4.9), and 12.2 (SD=5.8) for participants randomized to chlorthalidone, amlodipine, and lisinopril, respectively. After multivariable adjustment including mean SBP across visits and compared with participants randomized to chlorthalidone, participants randomized to amlodipine had a 0.36 (standard error [SE]: 0.07) lower SD of SBP and participants randomized to lisinopril had a 0.77 (SE=0.08) higher SD of SBP.

Often overlooked or misdiagnosed, hyponatremia can quickly deteriorate and cause serious and potentially life-threatening complications. In the orthopedic patient, hyponatremia can mimic common postoperative sequelae, thereby making diagnosis even more difficult. Although serious complications of hyponatremia are rare, they are severe, and early detection is crucial in initiating prompt treatment. From 2008 to 2010, 392 consecutive hip and knee arthroplasties were prospectively monitored for development of hyponatremia. Hyponatremia occurred in 155 (40%) of cases. Although the majority were mild, 7% were moderate or severe deficiencies, which are associated with increased morbidity. Risk factors included preoperative hyponatremia, female sex, older age, lower body weight, knee more than hip surgery, and bilateral knee arthroplasty. Thiazides and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were the only medications associated with low postoperative sodium values. Hyponatremia is common after elective orthopedic surgery and is associated with identifiable perioperative risk factors. Although the most severe complications are rare, failure to identify mild cases of hyponatremia allows the sodium deficit to worsen unnecessarily. Early detection is important because, unlike severe cases, mild hyponatremia is generally treatable with simple medical management.",

We conducted an audit of the cardiac management in patients with DMD requiring ventilatory support and reported a case series of the collated cardiac investigations. Patients with DMD requiring ventilatory support were included in the study. The date of the last electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiogram (ECHO), cardiology review and pharmacological management were retrieved from the medical records. If an annual cardiac assessment had not been performed this was requested and the latest ECGs and ECHO reports were collated. A total of 30 patients with DMD (29 males, mean (SD) age of 30 (7) years) met the inclusion criteria. Although there was ECG and ECHO documentation in 24 and 21 individuals, respectively, it was only recent in 10 and 6 individuals. In all, 60% of patients had been assessed by a cardiologist, but only 10% within the last year. Over half of the patients failed to attend their new appointments.

These trials share the limitation of excluding subsets of patients with high-risk clinical presentations, including episodic pulmonary edema and rapidly progressing renal failure and hypertension. Although hemodynamically significant, ARVD can reduce renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate; adaptive mechanisms preserve both cortical and medullary oxygenation over a wide range of vascular occlusion. Progression of ARVD to severe vascular compromise eventually produces cortical hypoxia, however, associated with active inflammatory cytokine release and cellular infiltration of the renal parenchyma. In such cases ARVD produces a loss of glomerular filtration rate that no longer is reversible simply by restoring vessel patency with technically successful renal revascularization. Each of these trials reported adverse renal functional outcomes ranging between 16 and 22% over periods of 2-5 years of follow-up. Blood pressure control and medication adjustment may become more difficult with declining renal function and may prevent the use of angiotensin receptor blocker and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. The objective of this review is to evaluate the current management of ARVD for clinical nephrologists in the context of recent randomized clinical trials and experimental research.",

We enrolled 211 patients with type 2 diabetes, urine albumin/creatinine ratios of 300-3500 mg/g, and eGFRs of 30-75 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) in two identically designed, parallel, multinational, double-blind studies. Participants were randomized to placebo (n=50) or to 0.75 mg/d (n=78) or 1.25 mg/d (n=83) atrasentan for 12 weeks.

Use of atrasentan was associated with a significant increase in weight and a reduction in hemoglobin, but rates of peripheral edema, heart failure, or other side effects did not differ between groups. However, more patients treated with 1.25 mg/d atrasentan discontinued due to adverse events. After stopping atrasentan for 30 days, measured parameters returned to pretreatment levels. In conclusion, atrasentan reduced albuminuria and improved BP and lipid spectrum with manageable fluid overload-related adverse events in patients with type 2 diabetic nephropathy receiving RAS inhibitors.",

The intravenous pretreatment with the angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonist losartan (5mg/kg) inhibited the pressor response to RS, but did not affect the concomitant RS-evoked tachycardiac response. Because similar effects were observed after the PVN pretreatment with CoCl2, and considering the high density of angiotensin receptors reported in the PVN, we studied the effect of the pretreatment of the PVN with either losartan or the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor lisinopril on the RS-evoked cardiovascular response. The bilateral microinjection of losartan (0.5 nmol/100 nL) or lisinopril (0.5 nmol/100nL) into the PVN inhibited the RS-related pressor response without affecting the tachycardiac response, suggesting that the PVN angiotensinergic neurotransmission modulates the vascular component of the stress response. Finally, to exclude the possibility that centrally injected drugs could be leaking to the circulation and acting on peripheral vascular receptors, we tested the effect of the intravenous pretreatment with either losartan (0.5 nmol/animal) or lisinopril (0.5 nmol/animal), assuming the hypothesis of a total spread of drugs from the CNS to the peripheral circulation. When animals were pretreated with such doses of either losartan or lisinopril, the cardiovascular RS-evoked response was not affected, thus indicating that even if there were a complete leakage of the drug to the periphery, it would not affect the cardiovascular response to RS. This observation favors the idea that the effect of the intravenous injection of 5mg/kg of losartan on the RS-related cardiovascular response would be explained by an action across the blood-brain barrier, possibly in the PVN. In conclusion, the results suggest that an angiotensinergic neurotransmission in the PVN acting on AT1-receptors modulates the vascular component of the RS-evoked cardiovascular response.",

Advantages of the six main substance classes, namely diuretics, beta-blockers (BBs), calcium channel blockers (CCBs), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and direct renin inhibitors (DRIs) are discussed. Medical and economic implications of drug administration in the very elderly are presented. Avoidance of treatment-related adverse effects has become increasingly relevant. Current substance classes are equally effective, with similar effects on cardiovascular outcomes. Selection of substances should therefore also be based on collateral advantages of drugs that extend beyond BP reduction. The combination of ACEIs and diuretics appears to be favorable in managing systolic/diastolic hypertension. Diuretics are a preferred and cheap combination drug, and the combination with CCBs is recommended for patients with isolated systolic hypertension. ACEIs and CCBs are favorable for patients with dementia, while CCBs and ARBs imply substantial cost savings due to high adherence.", 
    "509": "Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) plays a critical role in the development of ventricular remodeling after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Imidapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, has been shown to inhibit MMP activity. We investigated whether imidapril inhibits plasma MMP activities and attenuates ventricular remodeling in patients with AMI in comparison with enalapril. We enrolled 70 patients with AMI. All patients underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention and were randomly assigned either to imidapril (n = 35) or to enalapril (n = 35) treatment. Left ventriculography was performed in acute (day 14) and chronic (6 months) phases, and plasma MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities were measured by zymography. Any changes in left ventricular end-diastolic volume index and ejection fraction from acute to chronic phases did not differ between the 2 groups. The plasma MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities at day 14 were both significantly decreased compared with those at day 1 in both groups (all P < 0.05). At 6 months, MMP-9 activity still remained decreased in both groups (P < 0.05 vs. day 1). Overall, there were no differences between the 2 groups both in plasma MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities. These results demonstrate that imidapril exerts inhibitory effects on plasma MMP activities and attenuates left ventricular remodeling in patients with AMI similar to enalapril.",

    "514": "Clozapine (CLZ) is the most effective therapeutic alternative in the treatment of resistant schizophrenia. However, the cardiotoxicity of CLZ, particularly in young patients, has raised concerns about its safety. Captopril is a well-known angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor with antioxidant properties effective in treating hypertension and heart failure. The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effect of captopril against clozapine-induced myocarditis in rats and the possible mechanisms behind this effect. The effect of captopril treatment [5 or 10mg/kg/d, injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) for 21days] on the cardiotoxic effect of coadministered CLZ (25mg/kg/d, i.p.) was assessed. Myocarditis was assessed histopathologically, immunohistochemically and biochemically. Frozen heart specimens were used to determine the amount of lipid peroxides product (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), reduced glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity, proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1 and IL-10) and DNA degradation product(8-OHdG). Coadministration of captopril with the tested doses of CLZ decreased the histological hallmarks and biochemical markers (CK-MP and LDH) of myocarditis. In addition, captopril attenuated the effects of CLZ on oxidative stress parameters, NO and serum and cardiac 8-OHdG levels. Captopril significantly attenuated the effect of CLZ on all measured parameters in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggested that captopril exerts a protective action against CLZ-induced myocarditis. Multiple mechanisms contribute to this effect, including a decrease in cardiac oxidative stress and proinflammatory cytokines production, modulation of antioxidant status and protection from oxidative DNA damage. Hence, captopril may be effective in reducing the incidence and severity of CLZ-induced myocarditis in humans.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate BOLD signals before and after treatment with RAS inhibitors in hypertensive chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Ten patients with stable CKD and 5 healthy volunteers were included. Five CKD patients were subjected to BOLD MRI scan before and after chronic treatment with 300 mg/day aliskiren for at least 6 weeks. Five other CKD patients received BOLD MRI before and 1 hour after acute treatment with 50 mg captopril. A group of healthy volunteers (n=5) was scanned before and 1 hour after acute treatment with 50 mg captopril. The 10 patients had a mean age of 61\u00b117 years; eGFR of 30\u00b111 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) . Office systolic and diastolic blood pressures when on a RAS inhibito, were 130\u00b110 and 86\u00b15 mmHg in CKD patients. Control subjects had normal kidney function and were not on any medication. In untreated condition, systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressure elevated, 145\u00b16 and 95\u00b14 mmHg, respectively. After chronic treatment with aliskiren, arterial blood pressure decreased in all patients in this group, 127\u00b13 mmHg and 77\u00b13 mmHg. After acute treatment with captopril arterial blood pressure reduced to 125\u00b14 and 71\u00b18 mmHg. Tissue intensity signal (T2*) was increased in medulla after chronic treatment from 29\u00b16 to 34\u00b16 and after acute treatment with captopril from 34\u00b19 to 38\u00b111 in CKD patients. In addition, T2* ratio between cortex and medulla decreased in CKD patients after chronic treatment and acute treatment. This ratio remained stable in healthy volunteers before and after treatment with captopril 1.62\u00b10.1 and 1.65\u00b10.1, respectively. This study shows for the first time that RAS inhibitors change BOLD signal in CKD patients. Importantly, in healthy volunteers, a RAS inhibitor had no such effect. Further investigation is required.",

Excipients, largely used as insert vehicles in formulation, have been recently reported to affect drug enzyme activity. The influence of excipients on the activity of CES remains undefined. In this study, the inhibitory effects of 25 excipients on the activities of CES1A1 and CES2 were evaluated. Imidapril and CPT-11 were used as substrates and cultured with liver microsomes in vitro. Imidapril hydrolase activities of recombinant CES1A1 and human liver microsomes (HLM) were strongly inhibited by sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS) and polyoxyl 40 hydrogenated castor oil (RH40) [Inhibition constant (Ki)\u200a=\u200a0.04 \u00b1 0.01 \u03bcg/ml and 0.20 \u00b1 0.09 \u03bcg/ml for CES1A1, and 0.12 \u00b1 0.03 \u03bcg/ml and 0.76 \u00b1 0.33 \u03bcg/ml, respectively, for HLM].

The Evaluation of Methods and Management of Acute Coronary Events registry enrolled patients who had been hospitalized for an acute coronary syndrome. There were 1,602 patients who had cardiac catheterization that were used for this analysis. The main outcome measures were evidence-based therapies prescribed at discharge and 6-month incidence of all-cause mortality. The cohort consisted of 1,252 patients with obstructive CAD (>50% luminal diameter obstructed) and 350 patients with nonobstructive CAD. Multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusted for further medications and other clinical factors was performed. Patients with nonobstructive CAD had significantly (p <0.001) higher rates of \u03b2-blocker (77.8% vs 63.3%) and lower rates of ACE-inhibitor (57.7% vs 66.4%) prescriptions. In patients with nonobstructive CAD, ACE-inhibitor therapy was clearly associated with a lower 6-month mortality (odds ratio [OR] 0.31, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.03 to 0.78, p = 0.004). No significant association between \u03b2-blocker use and death was found. In patients with obstructive CAD, both \u03b2 blockers (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.67, p <0.001) and ACE inhibitors (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.87, p = 0.01) were significantly associated with a reduced risk of 6-month mortality. In conclusion, ACE-inhibitor therapy seems to be an effective first-line treatment for preventing the occurrence of mortality in patients with nonobstructive CAD.",

Our aim was to investigate the influence apolipoprotein E (APOE) and angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) polymorphism and ACE inhibitors use, besides their interaction on memory performance of healthy subjects over 50 years. The sample consisted of 205 subjects assessed for five types of episodic memory, using Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R), who answered a questionnaire about drug use and were assessed for the ACE insertion/deletion polymorphism and APOE polymorphism. We found no influence of the APOE gene. The use of ACE inhibitors beneficially influenced learning ability scores (p\u2009=\u20090.02). Besides, I allele carriers of ACE polymorphism showed higher verbal memory scores compared with homozygous DD. Also, we observed an interaction influencing learning ability between the ACE polymorphism and the use of inhibitors, the beneficial influence of the I allele was present only in individuals who make use of ACE inhibitors. We conclude that the ACE gene has influence on memory performance, and that this influence is modulated by ACE inhibitors use.", 
    "542": "Erythropoietin (EPO) is the primary regulator of red blood cell development. Although hypoxic regulation of EPO has been extensively studied, the mechanism(s) for basal regulation of EPO are not well understood. In vivo studies in healthy human volunteers and animal models indicated that angiotensin II (Ang II) and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors regulated blood EPO levels. In the current study, we found that Ang II induced EPO expression in situ in murine kidney slices and in 786-O kidney cells in culture as determined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. We further investigated the signaling mechanism of Ang II regulation of EPO in 786-O cells. Pharmacological inhibitors of Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1R) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) suppressed Ang II transcriptional activation of EPO. Inhibitors of AT2R or Src homology 2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase had no effect. Coimmunoprecipiation experiments demonstrated that p21Ras was constitutively bound to the AT1R; this association was increased by Ang II but was reduced by the AT1R inhibitor telmisartan. Transmembrane domain (TM) 2 of AT1R is important for G protein-dependent ERK1/2 activation, and mutant D74E in TM2 blocked Ang II activation of ERK1/2. Ang II signaling induced the nuclear translocation of the Egr-1 transcription factor, and overexpression of dominant-negative Egr-1 blocked EPO promoter activation by Ang II. These data identify a novel pathway for basal regulation of EPO via AT1R-mediated Egr-1 activation by p21Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase-ERK1/2. Our current data suggest that Ang II, in addition to regulating blood volume and pressure, may be a master regulator of erythropoiesis.", 
    "543": "Both endothelial dysfunction and arterial stiffness are surrogate markers of atherosclerosis and thus cardiovascular (CV) events. The milk-derived peptides Val-Pro-Pro (VPP) and Ile-Pro-Pro (IPP) inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme, dilate blood vessels ex vivo and stimulate nitric oxide (NO) production in cells. In this study, we investigated the effects of either VPP or IPP on arterial function and on target organ damage in vivo. Male Wistar rats were treated with N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (L-NAME, 1\u2009g\u2009l(-1)), L-NAME+VPP (0.3\u2009g\u2009l(-1)) or L-NAME+IPP (0.3\u2009g\u2009l(-1)) in their drinking water for 8 weeks. Plasma nitrite and nitrate (NOx) levels were significantly increased in normal Wistar rats after supplementation with either VPP or IPP but not in rats that were chronically treated with L-NAME. Acetylcholine-induced vasorelaxation in the thoracic aorta ring was impaired by L-NAME, whereas vasorelaxation was significantly greater in mice treated with L-NAME+VPP for 1 or 4 weeks or L-NAME+IPP for 4 weeks than in mice treated with L-NAME alone. Four weeks of treatment with either VPP or IPP attenuated the increase in pulse wave velocity (PWV) that was induced by L-NAME. Cardiac and renal damage were observed after 8 weeks of treatment with L-NAME, and either VPP or IPP attenuated this damage. These results show that VPP or IPP attenuates arterial dysfunction and suggest that milk-derived peptides might prevent CV damage.",

These drugs decrease mortality by up to one-fifth in these patients. We and others have reported previously that endogenous inhibitory substances suppress serum ACE activity, in vivo, similarly to the ACE inhibitor drugs. Here we have made an effort to identify this endogenous ACE inhibitor substance. ACE was crosslinked with interacting proteins in human sera. The crosslinked products were immunoprecipitated and subjected to Western blot. One of the crosslinked products was recognized by both anti-ACE and anti-HSA (human serum albumin) antibodies. Direct ACE-HSA interaction was confirmed by binding assays using purified ACE and HSA. HSA inhibited human purified (circulating) and human recombinant ACE with potencies (IC50) of 5.7 \u00b1 0.7 and 9.5 \u00b1 1.1 mg/mL, respectively. Effects of HSA on the tissue bound native ACE were tested on human saphenous vein samples. Angiotensin I evoked vasoconstriction was inhibited by HSA in this vascular tissue (maximal force with HSA: 6.14 \u00b1 1.34 mN, without HSA: 13.54 \u00b1 2.63 mN), while HSA was without effects on angiotensin II mediated constrictions (maximal force with HSA: 18.73 \u00b1 2.17 mN, without HSA: 19.22 \u00b1 3.50 mN). The main finding of this study is that HSA was identified as a potent physiological inhibitor of the ACE. The enzymatic activity of ACE appears to be almost completely suppressed by HSA when it is present in its physiological concentration. These data suggest that angiotensin I conversion is limited by low physiological ACE activities, in vivo.",

ACE inhibitors decrease 5-year mortality by approximately one-fifth in cardiovascular patients. Surprisingly, there are reports dating back to 1979 suggesting the existence of endogenous ACE inhibitors, which endogenous inhibitory effects are much less characterized than that for the clinically administered ACE inhibitors. Here we aimed to investigate this endogenous ACE inhibition in human sera. It was hypothesized that ACE activity is masked by an endogenous inhibitor, which dissociates from the ACE when its concentration decreases upon dilution. ACE activity was measured by FAPGG hydrolysis first. The specific (dilution corrected) enzyme activities significantly increased by dilution of human serum samples (23.2 \u00b1 0.7 U/L at 4-fold dilution, 51.4 \u00b1 0.3 U/L at 32-fold dilution, n = 3, p = 0.001), suggesting the presence of an endogenous inhibitor. In accordance, specific enzyme activities did not changed by dilution when purified renal ACE was used, where no endogenous inhibitor was present (655 \u00b1 145 U/L, 605 \u00b1 42 U/L, n = 3, p = 0.715, respectively). FAPGG conversion strongly correlated with angiotensin I conversion suggesting that this feature is not related to the artificial substrate. Serum samples were ultra-filtered to separate ACE (MW: 180 kDa) and the hypothesized inhibitor. Filtering through 50 kDa filters was without effect, while filtering through 100 kDa filters eliminated the inhibiting factor (ACE activity after <100 kDa filtering: 56.4 \u00b1 2.4 U/L, n = 4, control: 26.4 \u00b1 0.7 U/L, n = 4, p<0.001). Lineweaver-Burk plot indicated non-competitive inhibition of ACE by this endogenous factor. The endogenous inhibitor had higher potency on the C-terminal active site than N-terminal active site of ACE. Finally, this endogenous ACE inhibition was also present in mouse, donkey, goat, bovine sera besides men (increasing of specific ACE activity from 4-fold to 32-fold dilution: 2.8-fold, 1.7-fold, 1.5-fold, 1.8-fold, 2.6-fold, respectively).

Surprisingly, there are reports dating back to 1979 suggesting the existence of endogenous ACE inhibitors. Here we investigated the clinical significance of this potential endogenous ACE inhibition. ACE concentration and activity was measured in patient's serum samples (n = 151). ACE concentration was found to be in a wide range (47-288 ng/mL). ACE activity decreased with the increasing concentration of the serum albumin (HSA): ACE activity was 56 \u00b1 1 U/L in the presence of 2.4 \u00b1 0.3 mg/mL HSA, compared to 39 \u00b1 1 U/L in the presence of 12 \u00b1 1 mg/mL HSA (values are mean \u00b1 SEM). Effects of the differences in ACE concentration were suppressed in human sera: patients with ACE DD genotype exhibited a 64% higher serum ACE concentration (range, 74-288 ng/mL, median, 155.2 ng/mL, n = 52) compared to patients with II genotype (range, 47-194 ng/mL, median, 94.5 ng/mL, n = 28) while the difference in ACE activities was only 32% (range, 27.3-59.8 U/L, median, 43.11 U/L, and range 15.6-55.4 U/L, median, 32.74 U/L, respectively) in the presence of 12 \u00b1 1 mg/mL HSA. No correlations were found between serum ACE concentration (or genotype) and cardiovascular diseases, in accordance with the proposed suppressed physiological ACE activities by HSA (concentration in the sera of these patients: 48.5 \u00b1 0.5 mg/mL) or other endogenous inhibitors.

Bisoprolol and ramipril are widely used in the treatment of HF, and midazolam and propranolol are markers of hepatic metabolism, which can be altered in HF.

    "567": "Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is considered the third leading cause of iatrogenic acute kidney injury in high-risk patients undergoing radiographic procedures. The main mechanism leading to CIN is medullary hypoxia due to decreased renal blood flow, secondary to renal artery vasoconstriction and direct tubular toxicity by contrast medium. Furthermore, experimental data suggests that an activated renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays a role in the pathophysiology of CIN. However, the role of RAAS blockers, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in CIN is controversial. They have been reported to be effective in the prevention of CIN in previous studies, but some studies have concluded that they were associated with an increased risk of CIN, especially in patients with pre-existing renal impairment. In summary, there is no solid data to link ACE inhibitors and ARB to CIN, and larger randomised controlled trials are necessary to further investigate their role in the development of CIN.

Microvascular injury and thrombosis are the dominant histologic findings. Complement activation through the alternative pathway plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of atypical HUS. Genetic abnormalities involving complement regulatory proteins and complement components form the molecular basis for complement activation. Endothelial cell dysfunction, probably because of the effects of complement activation, is an intermediate stage in the pathophysiologic cascade. Atypical HUS has a grave prognosis. Although mortality approaches 25% during the acute phase, end-stage renal disease develops in nearly half of patients within a year. Atypical HUS has a high recurrence rate after renal transplantation, and recurrent disease often leads to graft loss. Plasma therapy in the form of plasma exchange or infusion has remained the standard treatment for atypical HUS. However, many patients do not respond to plasma therapy and some require prolonged treatment. Approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the treatment of atypical HUS, eculizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks cleavage of complement C5 into biologically active mediators of inflammation and cytolysis. Although case reports have shown the efficacy of eculizumab, randomized clinical trials are lacking. Therapeutic strategies targeting endothelial cells have demonstrated promising results in experimental settings.

Inhibition of renin angiotensin system (RAS) or blockade of Ang II receptors may therefore be effective in reducing oxidative stress during AMI. The study evaluates and compares the protective effect of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and AT1 receptor blocker in adrenaline induced oxidative stress in rats. Rats were treated with two successive injections of adrenaline subcutaneously at a dose of 2 mg/kg administered 24 hours apart. In other two groups of rats enalapril (30 mg/kg) or valsartan (30 mg/kg) were given orally once daily through intragastric tube for 2 weeks and then two injections of adrenaline were administered 24 hours apart. Serum Aspertate Transaminase (AST), plasma Malonde Aldehyde (MDA), erythrocyte GSH and serum vitamin E levels were measured 24 hours after the 2nd injection of adrenaline in all the groups. Administration of adrenaline caused significant increase (p < 0.001) in serum AST and plasma MDA levels and decrease (p < 0.001) in erythrocyte GSH and serum vitamin E levels. Pre-treatment of enalapril or valsartan for 14 days reduced (p < 0.001) serum AST and plasma MDA levels and increased the concentration of erythrocyte GSH in enalapril pre-treated group (p < 0.01) and in valsartan pre-treated group (p < 0.05). Pre-treatment of enalapril or valsartan also increased (p < 0.01) serum vitamin E levels in adrenaline treated rats. However, no significant difference was noted between the effect of enalapril and valsartan on serum AST, plasma MDA, erythrocyte GSH and serum vitamin E levels. It may be concluded that both enalapril and valsartan offered cardioprotection in adrenaline induced oxidative stress, but the protection afforded by valsartan was not superior to enalapril.",

However, the underlying mechanisms are not completely understood. In the present study, we investigated whether uric acid upregulates renin-angiotensin system (RAS) expression in adipocytes. We also examined whether RAS activation plays a role in uric acid-induced oxidative stress in adipocytes. The adipocytes of different phenotypes were incubated with uric acid for 48\u00a0h, respectively. Losartan (10(-4)\u00a0M) or captopril (10(-4)\u00a0M) was used to block adipose tissue RAS activation. mRNA expressions of angiotensinogen (AGT), angiotensin-converting enzyme-1 (ACE-1), renin, angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R), and angiotensin type 2 receptor (AT2R) were evaluated with real-time PCR. Angiotensin II concentrations in supernatant were measured by ELISA. Intracellular reactive species (ROS) levels were measured by fluorescent probe DCFH-DA, DHR, or NBT assay. The uric acid upregulated both RAS (AGT, ACE1, renin, AT1R, and AT2R) mRNA expressions and angiotensin II protein secretion and caused a significant increase in ROS production in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. These effects could be prevented by RAS inhibitors, either losartan or captopril.

In addition, wortmannin, a transcytosis inhibitor, had little effect on the transport, suggesting that endocytosis was not involved in the transport of QIGLF. However, the transport of QIGLF was increased significantly in the presence of cytochalasin D, a tight junction disruptor, suggesting that paracellular transport via tight junctions was the major transport mechanism for intact QIGLF across Caco-2 cell monolayers.

    "664": "Angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)] is an alternative product of the brain renin-angiotensin system that exhibits central actions to lower blood pressure and improve baroreflex sensitivity. We previously identified a peptidase that metabolizes Ang-(1-7) to the inactive metabolite product Ang-(1-4) in CSF of adult sheep. This study purified the peptidase 1445-fold from sheep brain medulla and characterized this activity. The peptidase was sensitive to the chelating agents o-phenanthroline and EDTA, as well as the mercury compound p-chloromercuribenzoic acid (PCMB). Selective inhibitors to angiotensin-converting enzyme, neprilysin, neurolysin, and thimet oligopeptidase did not attenuate activity; however, the metallopeptidase agent JMV-390 was a potent inhibitor of Ang-(1-7) hydrolysis (Ki\u00a0=\u00a00.8\u00a0nM). Kinetic studies using (125) I-labeled Ang-(1-7), Ang II, and Ang I revealed comparable apparent Km values (2.6, 2.8, and 4.3\u00a0\u03bcM, respectively), but a higher apparent Vmax for Ang-(1-7) (72 vs. 30 and 6\u00a0nmol/min/mg, respectively; p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). HPLC analysis of the activity confirmed the processing of unlabeled Ang-(1-7) to Ang-(1-4) by the peptidase, but revealed <\u00a05% hydrolysis of Ang II or Ang I, and no hydrolysis of neurotensin, bradykinin or apelin-13. The unique characteristics of the purified neuropeptidase may portend a novel pathway to influence actions of Ang-(1-7) within the brain. Angiotensin-(1-7) actions are mediated by the AT7 /Mas receptor and include reduced blood pressure, decreased oxidative stress, enhanced baroreflex sensitivity, and increased nitric oxide (NO). Ang-(1-7) is directly formed from Ang I by neprilysin (NEP). We identify a new pathway for Ang-(1-7) metabolism in the brain distinct from angiotensin-converting enzyme-dependent hydrolysis. The Ang-(1-7) endopeptidase (A7-EP) degrades the peptide to Ang-(1-4) and may influence central Ang-(1-7) tone.",

In this study, winged bean seed (WBS), a potential source of protein, was utilised for the production of bifunctional proteolysate and biopeptides with ACE inhibitory and antioxidative properties. An enzymatic approach was applied, coupled with pretreatment of shaking and centrifuging techniques to remove endogenous ACE inhibitors prior to proteolysis. ACE inhibition reached its highest activity, 78.5%, after 12 h proteolysis while antioxidative activities, determined using assays involving DPPH\u02d9 radical scavenging activity and metal ion-chelating activity, reached peaks of 65.0% and 65.7% at 8 h and 14 h, respectively. The said bioactivities were proposed to share some common structural requirements among peptides. A two-dimensional approach was employed for characterisation of effective peptides based on hydrophobicity, using RP-HPLC, and isoelectric property, using isoelectric focusing technique. Results revealed that acidic and basic peptides with partially higher hydrophobicity provided higher ACE inhibition activity than did neutral peptides. Finally, by using Q-TOF mass spectrometry, two peptide sequences (YPNQKV and FDIRA) with ACE inhibitory and antioxidative activities were successfully matched with a database. This study indicates that the WBS proteolysate can be a potential bifunctional food ingredient as the identified biopeptides demonstrated both ACE inhibitory and antioxidative activities in vitro.",

This review summarises the various studies reported in the literature describing the development and evaluation of transdermal formulations of ACE inhibitors. Captopril, enalapril maleate, lisinopril dihydrate, perindopril erbumine and trandolapril are the most studied in connection with transdermal preparations. The methodologies reported are considered critically and the limitations of the various skin models used are also highlighted. Finally, opportunities for novel transdermal preparations of ACE inhibitor drugs are discussed with an emphasis on rational formulation design.",

The electrocatalytic effect of polytaurine modified Au (PT/Au) electrode was investigated for electro-oxidation of captopril (CAP). Electrocatalytical activity of PT/Au electrode was studied using cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronoamperometry and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). DPV was used to evaluate the analytical performance of CAP in the presence of phosphate buffer solution and good limit of detection was obtained by this sensor. The experimental conditions influencing the determination of CAP were optimized and under optimal conditions, the oxidation peak current was proportional to CAP concentration in the range of 0.06-0.2 \u03bcM, while the detection limit was 0.03 \u03bcM (S/N=3). The results revealed that PT promotes the rate of oxidation by increasing the peak current. Finally, the applicability of the method to direct assay of human serum is described. The proposed sensor was successfully applied to determine cadaverine in fish samples, yielding satisfactory results. The spiked recoveries were in the range of 96.0-105.0%.",

Ameliorating roles of angiotensin (ANG) II and vasopressin in anaphylactic hypotension were investigated in anesthetized ovalbumin-sensitized Sprague-Dawley rats. The sensitized rats were randomly allocated to the following pretreatment groups (n=7/group): (1) control (non-pretreatment), (2) ANG II synthesis inhibitor captopril, (3) ANG II receptor antagonist losartan, and (4) V1a vasopressin receptor antagonist. Anaphylactic shock was induced by an intravenous injection of the antigen. The systemic arterial pressure (SAP), central venous pressure (CVP), portal venous pressure (PVP) and portal venous blood flow (PBF) were measured, and splanchnic vascular resistance (Rspl: (SAP-PVP)/PBF) was determined. In the control group, SAP markedly decreased, followed by a gradual recovery toward baseline. Rspl transiently decreased immediately after antigen, and then increased 1.5-fold at 15 min and thereafter. The pretreatment with either losartan, captopril or V1a receptor antagonist augmented the initial fall of SAP and attenuated the SAP recovery along with augmentation of the late increase in Rspl. The 2-h survival rate was significantly smaller in either pretreatment group than in the control group (100%). Plasma levels of ANG II and vasopressin increased to 3.8- and 9.8-fold, respectively, at 30 min after antigen in the control group, whereas captopril pretreatment inhibited the increase in ANG II. In conclusion, inhibition of ANG II or vasopressin exacerbates anaphylaxis-induced hypotension in anesthetized rats.",

The crisis in IAB is undramatic until predictable complications appear. Nevertheless, the danger in IAB is real because of the major associations with multiple medical conditions, including atrial fibrillation, myocardial ischemia, left atrial enlargement, and systemic emboli. There are different treatment options for IAB to eliminate its consequences, including pacing and medical management with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers. Pacing has been shown to give promising results and could potentially prevent conditions related to cardiovascular disease such as hypertension or diabetes mellitus. Given the high prevalence of IAB, together with its potentially serious consequences, and yet being largely ignored, we stress attention to this potentially dangerous pandemic and raise consideration for further investigations.",

Elderly COPD patients are characterized by a complexity due to an increasing prevalence of comorbidities related to the age that suggest peculiar care in prescribing the therapy in those patients, also considering other disabilities that are not related with respiratory disorders as physical and mental limitations. Nowadays a therapy that allows modifying the long-term decline in lung function of patients suffering from COPD does not yet exist and, therefore, the treatment of this disease is mainly focused on the administration of bronchodilators and the use of inhaled glucocorticoids. As for younger subjects, also in elderly patients the main classes of bronchodilators used in the treatment of COPD include \u03b22-agonists, anticholinergics and methylxanthines. The inflammatory response suppression represents another mechanistic approach for treating COPD in the elderly, although the use of inhaled corticosteroids is limited to specific indications. Indeed, nowadays there is a strong medical need for novel treatments of COPD in the elderly. These are mainly represented by agents that reduce the spillover of inflammatory mediators from the lung and by compounds that inhibit the chronic systemic inflammatory syndrome. The therapeutic approach of COPD in elderly patients remains a topic of increasing interest, however the development of novel compounds for preventing the COPD progression in the elderly, other than bronchodilators and corticosteroids, remains a challenge.", 
    "690": "The contribution of vascular risk factors to Alzheimer-vascular spectrum dementias is increasingly being recognized. We provide an overview of recent literature on this subject. Overweight and obesity as well as underweight during midlife predict cognitive decline and dementia later in life. Hypertension during midlife is also associated with dementia later in life and the association is stronger for untreated hypertension. Calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin-1 receptor-blockers may be particularly beneficial in diminishing the risk of dementia associated with hypertension. Studies have fairly consistently shown that type 2 diabetes is a risk factor for dementia. Episodes of hypoglycemia add to this risk. Regular physical exercise during any point in the lifespan protects against cognitive decline and dementia. Most benefit is realized with physical exercise during early and midlife. Dyslipidemia also increases the risk of dementia but the findings are less consistent. Findings on the possible benefit of lipid-lowering agents (statins) are conflicting. Earlier studies identified smoking as protective of dementia but recent better designed studies have consistently shown that smoking increases the risk of dementia. The association of vascular risk factors with dementia is more robust for vascular dementia than Alzheimer's disease. Heterogeneity of studies and lack of trials specifically designed to assess cognition as an endpoint make firm conclusions difficult. But considering the expected global burden of dementia and projected attributable risk of vascular risk factors to it, there is sufficient evidence to promote vascular risk factor reduction strategies as dementia prevention interventions.",

    "693": "While bradykinin (BK) is known to be degraded by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), we have recently discovered that Met-Lys-BK-Ser-Ser is paradoxically activated by ACE. We designed and evaluated additional \"prodrug\" peptides extended around the BK sequence as potential ligands that could be locally activated by vascular or blood plasma peptidases. BK regeneration was estimated using the contractility of the human umbilical vein as model of vascular functions mediated by endogenous B2 receptors (B2Rs) and the endocytosis of the fusion protein B2R-green fluorescent protein (B2R-GFP) expressed in Human Embryonic Kidney 293 cells. Of three BK sequences extended by a C-terminal dipeptide, BK-His-Leu had the most desirable profile, exhibiting little direct affinity for the receptor but a significant one for ACE (as shown by competition of [(3)H]BK binding to B2R-GFP or of [(3)H]enalaprilat to recombinant ACE, respectively). The potency of the contractile effect of this analog on the vein was reduced 18-fold by the ACE inhibitor enalaprilat, pharmacologically evidencing BK regeneration in situ. BK-Arg, a potential substrate of arginine carboxypeptidases, had a low affinity for B2Rs and its potency as a contractile agent was reduced 15-fold by tissue treatment with an inhibitor of these enzymes, Plummer's inhibitor. B2R-GFP internalization in response to 100 nM of the extended peptides recapitulated these findings, as enalaprilat selectively inhibited the effect of BK-His-Leu and Plummer's inhibitor, that of BK-Arg. The two peptidase inhibitors did not affect BK-induced effects in either assay. The novel C-terminally extended BKs had no or very little affinity for the kinin B1 receptor (competition of [(3)H]Lys-des-Arg(9)-BK binding). The feasibility of peptidase-activated B2R agonists is illustrated by C-terminal extensions of the BK sequence.",

The variables found to be predictive of progression to the ESRD included younger age, smoking, diabetes, higher systolic blood pressure, no use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), lower hemoglobin and serum albumin levels, higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration, presence of proteinuria, and low RLC in the univariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis.

One angiogenic pathway recently identified as playing an essential role in renal vascular development is the stromal cell-derived factor-1\u03b1 (SDF-1)/CXCR4 pathway. Because similar developmental processes may be recapitulated in the disease setting, we hypothesized that the SDF-1/CXCR4 system would regulate microvascular health in CKD. Expression of CXCR4 was observed to be increased in the kidneys of subtotally nephrectomized (SNx) rats and in biopsies from patients with secondary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), a rodent model and human correlate both characterized by aberration of the renal microvessels. A reno-protective role for local SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling was indicated by i) CXCR4-dependent glomerular eNOS activation following acute SDF-1 administration; and ii) acceleration of renal function decline, capillary loss and fibrosis in SNx rats treated with chronic CXCR4 blockade. In contrast to the upregulation of CXCR4, SDF-1 transcript levels were decreased in SNx rat kidneys as well as in renal fibroblasts exposed to the pro-fibrotic cytokine transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), the latter effect being attenuated by histone deacetylase inhibition. Increased renal SDF-1 expression was, however, observed following the treatment of SNx rats with the ACE inhibitor, perindopril. Collectively, these observations indicate that local SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling functions to preserve microvascular integrity and prevent renal fibrosis. Augmentation of this pathway, either purposefully or serendipitously with either novel or existing therapies, may attenuate renal decline in CKD.",

In the past decades, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs)/angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) based first-line therapy can slow but cannot stop the progression of DN, which urgently requests the innovation of therapeutic strategies. Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), the synthetic exogenous ligands of nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- \u03b3 (PPAR \u03b3 ), had been thought to be a promising candidate for strengthening the therapy of DN.

Tenapanor is an inhibitor of the sodium-proton (Na(+)/H(+)) exchanger NHE3, which plays a prominent role in sodium handling in the gastrointestinal tract and kidney. When administered orally to rats, tenapanor acted exclusively in the gastrointestinal tract to inhibit sodium uptake. We showed that the systemic availability of tenapanor was negligible through plasma pharmacokinetic studies, as well as autoradiography and mass balance studies performed with (14)C-tenapanor. In humans, tenapanor reduced urinary sodium excretion by 20 to 50 mmol/day and led to an increase of similar magnitude in stool sodium. In salt-fed nephrectomized rats exhibiting hypervolemia, cardiac hypertrophy, and arterial stiffening, tenapanor reduced extracellular fluid volume, left ventricular hypertrophy, albuminuria, and blood pressure in a dose-dependent fashion. We observed these effects whether tenapanor was administered prophylactically or after disease was established. In addition, the combination of tenapanor and the blood pressure medication enalapril improved cardiac diastolic dysfunction and arterial pulse wave velocity relative to enalapril monotherapy in this animal model. Tenapanor prevented increases in glomerular area and urinary KIM-1, a marker of renal injury. The results suggest that therapeutic alteration of sodium transport in the gastrointestinal tract instead of the kidney--the target of current drugs--could lead to improved sodium management in renal disease.",

As internal control, we assessed the relation between statin use and outcomes. At 4-year follow-up, the risk of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke (primary outcome) was similar in ACEI/ARB users compared with non-users (hazard ratio, 1.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.91-1.16; P = 0.66). Similarly, the risk of the primary outcome and cardiovascular hospitalization for atherothrombotic events (secondary outcome) was not reduced in ACEI/ARB users (hazard ratio, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.01-1.16; P = 0.04), nor were the rates of any of its components. Analyses using propensity score matching yielded similar results, as did sensitivity analyses accounting for missing covariates, changes in medications over time, or analysing separately ACEI and ARB use. In contrast, in the same cohort, statin use was associated with lower rates for all outcomes.",

    "769": "Adhesion of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) to vascular endothelial bed becomes a crucial starting point in metastatic cascade. We hypothesized that nitric oxide (NO) may prevent cancer metastasis from happening by its direct vasodilation and inhibition of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs). Here we show that S-nitrosocaptopril (CAP-NO, a typical NO donor) produced direct vasorelaxation that can be antagonized by typical NO scavenger hemoglobin and guanylate cyclase inhibitor. Cytokines significantly stimulated production of typical CAMs by the highly-purified human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). CAP-NO inhibited expression of the stimulated CAMs (particularly VCAM-1) and the resultant hetero-adhesion of human colorectal cancer cells HT-29 to the HUVECs in a concentration-dependent manner. The same concentration of CAP-NO, however, did not significantly affect cell viability, cell cycle and mitochondrial membrane potential of HT-29, thus excluding the possibility that inhibition of the hetero-adhesion was caused by cytotoxicity by CAP-NO on HT-29. Hemoglobin reversed the inhibition of CAP-NO on both the hetero-adhesion between HT-29 and HUVECs and VCAM-1 expression. These data demonstrate that CAP-NO, by directly releasing NO, produces vasorelaxation and interferes with hetero-adhesion of cancer cells to vascular endothelium via down-regulating expression of CAMs. The study highlights the importance of NO in cancer metastatic prevention.",

A lot is known about the risk factors of CIN, yet it remains a major cause of morbidity, end stage renal disease, prolonged hospital stay, and increased costs as well as a high mortality. Many patients undergoing contrast-based radiological investigations are treated with angiotensin converting inhibitors (ACE-Is) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) for their cardiac and renal benefits and their known mortality benefits. However, controversy exists among clinicians as to whether ACE-Is and ARBs should be continued or discontinued prior to contrast media exposure.

    "780": "Our previous study showed that three rapeseed protein-derived peptides (TF, LY and RALP) inhibited the in vitro activities of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and renin. Oral administration of these peptides to spontaneously hypertensive rats led to reductions in systolic blood pressure. In the present work, we examined the potential molecular mechanisms responsible for the ACE- and renin-inhibitory activities of these peptides. Enzyme inhibition kinetics showed competitive, non-competitive and mixed-type peptide-dependent inhibition of renin and ACE activities. Intrinsic fluorescence intensity data showed that LY and RALP have stronger binding effects on ACE molecule compared to that of TF. LY and RALP showed the highest inhibition of ACE and renin activities, respectively. Circular dichroism data showed that the inhibitory mechanism involved extensive peptide-dependent reductions in \u03b1-helix and \u03b2-sheet fractions of ACE and renin protein conformations. Molecular docking studies confirmed that the higher renin-inhibitory activity of RALP may be due to formation of several hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) with the enzyme's active site residues. The rapeseed peptides inhibited renin and ACE activities mostly through binding to enzyme active site or non-active sites and forming extensive H-bonds that distorted the normal configuration required for catalysis. Data presented from this work could enhance development of highly potent antihypertensive natural peptides or peptidomimetics.",

Rats in the sham group received aortic perfusion and extraluminal application of saline. A dose of 3 mg/kg/d of perindopril was fed orally in the perindopril group. The maximum abdominal aortic diameter was measured in vivo on days 0 and 28 and by ultrasound on days 7, 14, and 21. The arterial blood pressure was measured directly using a pressure transducer after cannulation in surgery and before death.

Proteinuria remission is one of the most important independent predictors of kidney survival. Children with FSGS who do not achieve partial or complete remission have a 50% risk of progression to ESRD within 5 years whereas those who enter complete remission have a 5-year kidney survival rate of 90%. Treatment of idiopathic FSGS commonly involves immune-based and nonimmunologic therapy options. This manuscript will review the current state of FSGS therapy for children.",

Regardless of the benefits from using monotherapy for diabetic kidney disease, there is still much improvement to wish for in terms of kidney prognosis in these populations. A great deal of research has gone into evaluating combinations of the RAAS blocking treatments in different populations and with different drugs and doses. Studies have mostly been short-term and use surrogate endpoints such as albuminuria. Side effects have been well known and expected in terms of increasing potassium levels and hypotension, but to an acceptable extent. With recent disappointing results from major hard endpoint trials using dual RAAS blockade the concept is now under scrutiny. In this review we will discuss the pros and cons of dual RAAS blockade, with facts and findings from smaller studies, endpoint trials, and meta-analyses.", 
    "791": "The 6-year anniversary of the first catheter-based renal denervation procedure for resistant hypertension has passed, and the 3-year follow-up results of the Symplicity HTN-1 are now published. At the 'end of the beginning', it is timely to reflect on the observations to-date for this revolutionary therapy, and to predict the next phase in its development and clinical application in hypertension treatment. In essence, on observations to hand, the procedure is efficacious and seems safe and durable. But will the blood pressure lowering truly be permanent (or might it be cancelled out by renal sympathetic nerve regrowth)? How can patient selection for the renal denervation procedure be optimized, given that some patients do not respond with a blood pressure fall? Will blood pressure lowering with renal denervation reduce the rate of clinical cardiovascular endpoints? Will long-term safety be acceptable? Can milder hypertension be cured? And there are unresolved procedural and technical questions: how much renal denervation is optimal; is unilateral denervation, now commonly used, beneficial; will renal denervation show a 'class effect', with the different energy forms now used for renal nerve ablation producing equivalent blood pressure lowering? At the 12-year anniversary, I expect these questions will be answered, and catheter-based renal denervation will have an established clinical role in the care of patients with severe grades of hypertension. Less certain is the common prediction of its application in early, mild hypertension, in parallel with, or even before anti-hypertensive drug prescribing.", 
    "792": "In this paper, we present a novel approach for the electrochemical detection of S-captopril based on graphene AuAg nanostructures used to modify an Au electrode. Multi-layer graphene (Gr) sheets decorated with embedded bimetallic AuAg nanoparticles were successfully synthesized catalytically with methane as the carbon source. The two catalytic systems contained 1.0 wt% Ag and 1.0 wt% Au, while the second had a larger concentration of metals (1.5 wt% Ag and 1.5 wt% Au) and was used for the synthesis of the Gr-AuAg-1 and Gr-AuAg-1.5 multicomponent samples. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy analysis indicated the presence of graphene flakes that had regular shapes (square or rectangular) and dimensions in the tens to hundreds of nanometers. We found that the size of the embedded AuAg nanoparticles varied between 5 and 100 nm, with the majority being smaller than 20 nm. Advanced scanning transmission electron microscopy studies indicated a bimetallic characteristic of the metallic clusters. The resulting Gr-AuAg-1 and Gr-AuAg-1.5 samples were used to modify the surface of commonly used Au substrates and subsequently employed for the direct electrochemical oxidation of S-captopril. By comparing the differential pulse voltammograms recorded with the two modified electrodes at various concentrations of captopril, the peak current was determined to be well-defined, even at relatively low concentration (10(-5) M), for the Au/Gr-AuAg-1.5 electrode. In contrast, the signals recorded with the Au/Gr-AuAg-1 electrode were poorly defined within a 5\u00d710(-6) to 5\u00d710(-3) M concentration range, and many of them overlapped with the background. Such composite materials could find significant applications in nanotechnology, sensing, or nanomedicine.",

Those therapies also increased during hospitalisation in both registries. Patients were treated by cardiologists in >90% of cases during hospitalisation; the main intravenous therapies in both registries were diuretics (94% and 97%), followed by vasodilators (47% and 22%) and inotropes (31% and 20%).

At the studied conditions, papain and trypsin were more effective in hydrolyzing NaCas than pancreatin. Pancreatin treatments showed an initial increase in surface hydrophobicity, contrasting with the consistent decrease for the other two treatments. The solubility of NaCas at acidic pH was improved, becoming pH-independent after 24h hydrolysis. The emulsifying properties generally showed improvements after hydrolysis. The DPPH free radical scavenging activity, reducing power, and inhibition of linoleic acid autoxidation were significantly enhanced after appropriate hydrolysis, while metal ion chelating effects were slightly attenuated. The angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory activity was significantly improved by up to 9 times than that of NaCas.

Ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) induced tachycardia, reduced dMAP and LV dP/dt max, and causes alterations of mitochondria structural and functional parameters with decreased oxygen consumption, increased reactive oxygen species production and reduced calcium retention capacity (CRC) with opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pores. This opening is mainly due to oxidative stress and calcium overload and seems to be the pivotal event in cell death after I/R. No drug treatment changed haemodynamic and electrophysiological parameters, but amlodipine and perindoprilate, either alone or combined, prevented mitochondrial alterations but only partially.

The HD modality (standard \u03b2 = 0.57, p < 0.001) and dialysis vintage (standard \u03b2 = 0.12, p = 0.02) were independent predictors of serum 8-OHdG in a multivariable linear regression model including age, sex, body mass index, dialysis modality (HD or PD), preceding time on dialysis (dialysis vintage), PEW, comorbidity score, IL-6, and use of angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers or statins. During follow-up, 107 patients died. In multivariable Cox regression models including all 303 patients and adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, dialysis modality, dialysis vintage, and comorbidity score, 8-OHdG was significantly associated with all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.40; 95% confidence limits: 1.05, 1.87 for 1 standard deviation increase of 8-OHdG).

A kidney biopsy specimen demonstrated onion-skin lesions in the arterioles and small arteries along with ischemic changes in the glomeruli, compatible with a diagnosis of hypertensive emergency (malignant hypertension). The intravenous administration of a calcium channel blocker, the oral administration of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin II receptor blocker and the transfusion of fresh frozen plasma were effective for treating the thrombocytopenia and progressive kidney dysfunction.

All rats were provided ad libitum standard diet (with or without drugs) and distilled water. After 45 days, the animals were weighed and killed. Liver, kidney, heart, spleen, pancreas, and blood samples were collected. Concentrations of glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, and albumin were assayed in serum.

Since, the ACEIs cause increased tissue prostaglandin levels, we hypothesized that the mechanisms of ACEI-induced IOP reduction have similarity with those of prostaglandin analogs. The present study investigated the involvement of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and cytokine activity modulation as the underlying mechanisms of ACEI-induced ocular hypotension. The IOP lowering effect of single drop of enalaprilat dehydrate 1% was evaluated in rats pretreated with a broad spectrum MMP inhibitor or a cytokine inhibitor. Effect of angiotensin receptor blocker, losartan potassium 2%, was also studied to evaluate involvement of angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1) in IOP lowering effect of ACEI. Topical treatment with single drop of enalaprilat resulted in significant IOP reduction in treated eye with mean peak reduction 20.3% at 3h post-instillation. Treatment with losartan resulted in a peak IOP reduction of 13.3%, which was significantly lower than enalaprilat, indicating involvement of mechanisms in addition to AT1 blockade. Pretreatment with a broad spectrum MMP inhibitor or a cytokine inhibitor significantly attenuated the enalprilat-induced IOP reduction with mean peak IOP reduction of 11.2% and 13.6% respectively. The IOP-lowering effect of enalaprilat seems to be attributed to reduced angiotensin II type 1 receptor stimulation and modulation of MMP and cytokines activities.",

The best correlations between KOWWIN logP and both hydrophobicity parameters, RM(0) and C0, (R(2)>0.850) were observed for NaCl (1.0-3.0M) while the lowest R(2) was obtained for (NH4)2SO4 (0.649 and 0.427, respectively) due to highest salting-out effect of (NH4)2SO4. The effect of selected inorganic salts in the salting-out mobile phases, on the solutes solubility and retention was evaluated. The topological polar surface area should be selected as independent variable (only this molecular descriptor showed low correlation with chromatographic hydrophobicity parameters) for multiple linear regression analysis, to obtain reliable correlation between angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor's intestinal absorption data and salting-out thin-layer chromatograpic hydrophobicity parameters. These correlations provide R(2)=0.823 for RM(0) or R(2)=0.799 for C0 indicating good relationship between predicted and literature available intestinal absorption (ranged from 22% to 70%) of investigated angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. The proposed in vitro model was checked with three in addition experimentally analyzed drugs, zofenopril, trandolapril and captoril. The satisfactory absorption prediction was obtained for zofenopril and trandolapril, while divergence established for captopril resulted from considerably different structure.",

In the present study, metabolic parameters, blood pressure, aortic endothelial function along with molecular and structural markers of glomerular and tubulointerstitial renal damage, were studied in a rat model of normotensive nephropathy induced by adriamycin and treated with PPAR\u03b3 agonist pioglitazone (12mg/kg, po), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor ramipril (1mg/kg, po) or their combination. Pioglitazone had no effect on systolic blood pressure, marginally reduced glycemia and improved aortic endothelium-dependent relaxation. In the kidney, pioglitazone prevented the development of proteinuria and focal glomerulosclerosis to the similar extent as blood-pressure lowering ramipril. Renoprotection provided by either treatment was associated with a reduction in the cortical expression of profibrotic plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and microvascular damage-inducing endothelin-1, and a limitation of interstitial macrophage influx. Treatment with PPAR\u03b3 agonist, as well as ACE inhibitor comparably affected renal expression of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) components, normalizing increased renal expression of ACE and enhancing the expression of Mas receptor. Interestingly, combined pioglitazone and ramipril treatment did not provide any additional renoprotection. These results demonstrate that in a nondiabetic renal disease, such as adriamycin-induced nephropathy, PPAR\u03b3 agonist pioglitazone provides renoprotection to a similar extent as an ACE inhibitor by interfering with the expression of local RAS components and attenuating related profibrotic and inflammatory mechanisms. The combination of the both agents, however, does not lead to any additional renal benefit.", 
    "822": "In women presenting for evaluation of suspected ischemic symptoms, a diagnosis of normal coronary arteries is 5 times more common than it is in men. These women are often labelled as having cardiac syndrome X, and a subset of them have microvascular angina caused by microvascular coronary dysfunction (MCD). MCD is not benign and is associated with an annual 2.5% cardiac event rate. Noninvasive testing for MCD remains insensitive, although newer imaging modalities, such as adenosine cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, appear promising. The gold standard for diagnosis of MCD is coronary reactivity testing, an invasive technique that is not available in many countries. With regard to treatment, large-scale trials are lacking. Although research is ongoing, the current platform of therapy consists of antiangina, antiplatelet, and endothelium-modifying agents (primarily angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and statins).",

These peptides have been identified in many cheeses, and Gamalost, a traditional Norwegian cheese, is particularly rich in these peptides. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to examine whether frequency of Gamalost intake was associated with blood pressure in a Norwegian population sample. Blood pressure and other clinical measurements, including the factors of metabolic syndrome, were obtained from 168 participants (56% female, mean age = 51 yr) who completed a questionnaire about dietary habits and other health-related factors. Mean Gamalost intake was 2 servings per week. The prevalence of hypertension was 23.8% in the population, with mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures of 128 and 78 mmHg, respectively. Intake of Gamalost was inversely associated with systolic blood pressure. Each increase in frequency unit of Gamalost intake corresponded to a reduction in systolic blood pressure of 0.72 mmHg, after controlling for sex, age, education, waist circumference, physical activity, smoking status, and dairy food intake. Results from this study indicate that consumption of Gamalost (or other foods rich in ACE-inhibiting peptides) may reduce blood pressure.",

This study investigates if a connection between FXST and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) might be an explanation for its pharmacological effects. ACE inhibition assay was performed on FXST capsule, 50% ethanol extracts from the four herbals and three selected saponins most abundant in P. notoginseng (Ginsenoside Rg1, Ginsenoside Rb1 and Notoginsenoside R1) using a biochemical test. Reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography of liberated hippuric acid from the ACE assay was conducted to determine the inhibitory effect. As a result, FXST and extracts from P. notoginseng showed a significant and dose-dependent inhibition on ACE activity with the IC50 values of 115\u00a0\u03bcg/ml and 179\u00a0\u03bcg/ml, respectively. But extracts from the other three herbals and the three selected saponins had no significant effect on ACE inhibition. Compared to other reported plant extracts, FXST could be considered as an effective ACE inhibitor. The inhibition of ACE activity supports the traditional use of FXST on blood circulation and the inhibitory property of FXST is mainly caused by P. notoginseng.",

For type 1 diabetes, pooled estimates of urinary albumin excretion (UAE) for treated patients with microalbuminuria were on average 67% [95% confidence interval (CI) 54% to 77%] lower at the end of the trial than for untreated patients. There was no significant treatment effect for patients with normoalbuminuria (p interaction\u2009=\u20090.006). For treated patients with type 2 diabetes and normoalbuminuria or microalbuminuria, UAE was lower by, on average, 21% (95% CI 97% to 32%) or 27% (95% CI 15% to 38%), respectively. The proportion (95% CI) of men and women with type 1 diabetes screened annually for microalbuminuria over 6 years and inaccurately identified as having microalbuminuria would be 48% (43% to 53%) and 55% (48% to 61%), respectively. The corresponding proportions for type 2 diabetes are 36% (32% to 42%) and 48% (41% to 55%). Decreasing the screening interval to 3-yearly would reduce this for men with type 1 diabetes to 38% (33% to 44%), with an increase in those not identified over 6 years from 1.5% (95% CI 1% to 2%) to 4% (95% CI 3% to 5%).

The probability that the intervention is cost saving is around 25%, and it has around an 80% chance of being below a cost-effectiveness threshold of \u00a330,000. For type 2 diabetes, incremental cost per QALY (SD) of a yearly compared with a 2-yearly screening interval was \u00a3606 (\u00a31782).

    "846": "The renin-angiotensin aldosterone system is a critical mechanism for controlling blood pressure, and exerts most of its physiological effects through the action of angiotensin II. In addition to increasing blood pressure by increasing vascular resistance, angiotensin II also stimulates aldosterone secretion from the adrenal gland. Aldosterone acts to cause an increase in sodium and water reabsorption, thus elevating blood pressure. Although treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors initially lowers circulating aldosterone, with chronic treatment aldosterone levels increase back to baseline, a phenomenon termed aldosterone escape; aldosterone blockade may therefore give added value in the treatment of hypertension. The first mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist developed was spironolactone, but its use has been severely hampered by adverse (notably oestrogenic) effects. The more recently developed mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist eplerenone exhibits a better adverse effect profile, although it is not devoid of effects similar to spironolactone. In addition, aldosterone activates non-genomic receptors that are not inhibited by either eplerenone or spironolactone. It is believed that deleterious organ remodelling is mediated by aldosterone via such non-genomic pathways. A new class of drugs, the aldosterone synthase inhibitors, is currently under development. These may offer a novel therapeutic approach for both lowering blood pressure and preventing the non-genomic effects of aldosterone.

    "865": "From 2000 to 2007, the percentage of patients prescribed the recommended monotherapy increased from 54.2% to 61.4% (p\u2009<\u20090.0001 for annual trend). Over the study period, black patients were more likely to be prescribed the recommended monotherapy than younger non-black patients (OR 0.16, 95% CI 0.12-0.21) and older non-black patients (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.37-0.65). After the introduction of the NICE guidelines there was an increase in the NICE recommended monotherapy (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.19-1.75) compared with the underlying trend. Compared to black patients, an increase in the use of recommended monotherapy was observed in younger non-black patients (OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.17-1.91) but not in older non-black patients (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.46-0.74).", 
    "866": "The introduction of the 2006 NICE guideline had the greatest impact on prescribing for younger non-black patients. Lower associated increases among black patients may be due to their higher levels of recommended prescribing at baseline. The analysis suggests that guidelines did not impact equally on all patient groups.", 
    "867": "Endogenous kinins are important vasoactive peptides whose effects are mediated by two G-Protein-coupled receptors (R), named B2R (constitutive) and B1R (inducible). They are involved in vascular homeostasis, ischemic pre- and post- conditioning, but also in cardiovascular diseases. They contribute to the therapeutic effects of angiotensin-1 converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin AT1 receptor blockers. Benefits derive primarily from vasodilatory, antiproliferative, antihypertrophic, antifibrotic, antithrombic and antioxidant properties, which are associated with the release of endothelial factors such as nitric oxide, prostacyclin and tissue plasminogen activator. Uncontrolled production of kinins or the inhibition of their metabolism may lead to unwanted pro-inflammatory side effects. Thus, B2R antagonism is salutary in angioedema, septic shock, stroke, and Chagas vasculopathy. B1R is virtually absent in healthy tissues, yet this receptor is induced by the cytokine pathway and the oxidative stress via the transcriptional nuclear factor NF-\u03baB. The B1R may play a compensatory role for the lack of B2R, and its up-regulation during tissue damage may be a useful mechanism of host defense. Activation of both receptors may be beneficial, notably in neovascularisation, angiogenesis, heart ischemia and diabetic nephropathy. At the same time, B1R is a potent activator of inducible nitric oxide and NADPH oxidase, which are associated with vascular inflammation, increased permeability, insulin resistance, endothelial dysfunction and diabetic complications. The dual beneficial and deleterious effects of kinin receptors and, particularly B1R, raise an unsettled issue on the therapeutic value of B1R/B2R agonists versus antagonists in cardiovascular diseases. Hence, the Janus-face of kinin receptors needs to be seriously addressed in the upcoming clinical trials for each pathological setting.",

    "873": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) are commonly prescribed for blood pressure control and renal protection. ACEI angioedema is a common problem in patients who are taking ACEI, although, in most cases, the disorder is self-limited, and spontaneous episodes of apparently unprovoked angioedema stop with the discontinuation of the medication. In a subset of patients, hospitalization and even intubation are required for airway protection. The diagnosis is made clinically. There are no laboratory studies that establish the diagnosis. However, such investigations help exclude alternative diagnoses as the cause for the patient's presentation. Conventional treatment with regimens used to control allergic angioedema is ineffective in this condition. The mechanism of ACEI-induced angioedema is thought to be related to its effect on the kallikrein-kinin system. Kallikrein is a protease that converts high-molecular-weight kininogens into kinins, primarily bradykinin. Medications recently developed, primarily icatibant and ecallantide, to control hereditary angioedema, a disorder also associated with kallikrein-kinin activation, have been used to treat ACEI angioedema with some success. The efficacy of these agents and their optimal use remains to be established by randomized and placebo controlled trials.",

It predominantly affects postmenopausal women and it is frequently preceded by situations of physical or psychological stress. The physiopathology is not completely understood but there is consensus that it is triggered by a surge of catecholamines consequent to the aforementioned stress conditions. The study of 32 cases diagnosed at three medical institutions in C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina, is reported. The mean age was 61 years, and 28 were female. All cases simulated acute coronary syndromes. Congestive heart failure developed in twelve cases (37.5%) and two patients (6.3%) developed cardiogenic shock. The left ventricular function normalized more rapidly than the electrocardiographic changes. The recurrence rate was 25%, the prognosis was benign considering that only one death occurred following a relapse. In general the findings are similar to previously published studies. Recent advances in the comprehension of the physiopathology of this cardiomyopathy gave way to the development of a rational therapeutic approach.", 
    "884": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, EC 3.4.15.1) is a metallopeptidase comprised of two homologous catalytic domains (N- and C-domains). The C-domain cleaves the vasoactive angiotensin II precursor, angiotensin I, more efficiently than the N-domain. Thus, C-domain-selective ACE inhibitors have been designed to investigate the pharmacological effects of blocking the C-terminal catalytic site of the enzyme and improve the side effect profile of current ACE inhibitors. Lisinopril-tryptophan (LisW-S), an analogue of the ACE inhibitor lisinopril, is highly selective for the C-domain. In this study, we have analysed the ex vivo domain selectivity and pharmacokinetic profile of LisW-S. The IC50 value of LisW-S was 38.5 nM in rat plasma using the fluorogenic substrate Abz-FRKP(Dnp)P-OH. For the pharmacokinetics analysis of LisW-S, a sensitive and selective LC-MS/MS method was developed and validated to determine the concentration of LisW-S in rat plasma. LisW-S was administered to Wistar rats at a dose of 1 mg/kg bodyweight intravenously, 5 mg/kg bodyweight orally. The Cmax obtained following oral administration of the drug was 0.082 \u03bcM and LisW-S had an apparent terminal elimination half-life of around 3.1 h. The pharmacokinetic data indicate that the oral bioavailability of LisW-S was approximately 5.4%. These data provide a basis for better understanding the absorption mechanism of LisW-S and evaluating its clinical application.",

We therefore used a rat model of the metabolic syndrome and compared the effects of enalapril, an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, with candoxatril, a neutral endopeptidase inhibitor that inhibits degradation of atrial natriuretic peptide and, in addition to lowering blood pressure, exerts metabolically beneficial activity. Ten male Sprague Dawley rats were fed regular rat chow for 5\u00a0weeks. Fifty male Sprague Dawley rats were fed a high-fructose diet for 3\u00a0weeks, followed by addition of enalapril, 10\u00a0mg/Kg/d, or candoxatril, 25, 50, or 100\u00a0mg/Kg/d, for 2\u00a0weeks. Systolic blood pressure, plasma triglyceride level, and insulin level were measured at baseline and after 3\u00a0weeks and 5\u00a0weeks. Three weeks of a high-fructose diet led to a significant increase in all metabolic parameters. Candoxatril and enalapril lowered systolic blood pressure significantly (candoxatril -10\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01 to -22\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0mm Hg and enalapril -27\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0mm Hg). High-dose candoxatril and enalapril significantly decreased plasma triglyceride levels (by 17.8% and 32.8%, respectively), but only high-dose candoxatril decreased plasma insulin levels significantly (by 25.3%). High-dose candoxatril is a metabolically favorable option for lowering blood pressure in a rat model of metabolic syndrome.",

After enalapril treatment, left ventricular end diastolic diameter (LVEDd), left ventricular end diastolic diameter normalized for body weight (LVEDdN) and percent mitral regurgitant jet decreased (P<0.05). The diastolic blood pressure decreased (P<0.05). Increased time domain parameters of HRV were found. For frequency domain analysis, the total frequency (TF) increased significantly (P<0.05). The normalized low frequency (LF norm) decreased while normalized high frequency (HF norm) increased causing significant reduction in LF/HF (P<0.05). Before enalapril treatment, LF was correlated with end diastolic volume (EDV) (P<0.01) and LVEDd (P<0.05). In conclusion, MR dogs receiving enalapril treatment for 14 days had increased cardiac parasympathetic tone while sympathetic tone was suppressed. The decreased sympathetic activity corresponded to the reduction in cardiac preload and afterload.",

Numerous medications used to manage CVD (e.g., statins and antihypertensives) are hypothesized to alter breast cancer risk, but there are few studies on breast cancer outcomes. The COmmonly used Medications and Breast Cancer Outcomes (COMBO) cohort was developed to study how medications and co-morbidities influence breast cancer prognosis. Cohort study among adult women, diagnosed with incident early stage breast cancer, and enrolled in an integrated health plan. Data sources included health plan administrative databases, Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results tumor registry, and medical records. Statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), beta blockers (BB), calcium blockers, and diuretics were the exposures of interest. The outcome was second breast cancer events (SBCE) defined as recurrence or second primary breast cancer. We used multivariable Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for SBCE, and components of SBCE. 4,216 women were followed for a median of 6.3 years, and 13.2 % experienced a SBCE (first of: n = 415 recurrences and n = 143 s primary breast cancers). Compared to non-users, we observed an increased risk of second primary breast cancer with ACEI use (HR = 1.66; 95 % CI, 1.06-2.58) and an increased risk of recurrence with BB use (HR = 1.29; 95 % CI, 1.01-1.64). There was suggestion of a reduced risk of SBCE with statin use (HR = 0.82; 95 % CI, 0.62-1.08) and second primary breast cancer with BB use (HR = 0.77; 95 % CI, 0.50-1.19). No differences in outcomes were observed by duration of medication use.

    "907": "Many clinical studies indicate that atrial fibrillation is closely related to hypertension. Atrial fibrillation is not only associated with the level of blood pressure (BP) but also with the circadian rhythms of BP. However, the underlying mechanisms of atrial fibrillation in essential hypertension patients remain largely unknown. Hypertension may facilitate the onset and persistence of atrial fibrillation by stretch-induced changes in the repolarization of atrial myocytes (triggers of atrial fibrillation) and atrial remodeling (structural and electrical remodeling). Importantly, the effects of hypertension on atrial fibrillation are progressive. These progressive anatomic, functional, electrophysiological and structural changes occur at different times. This characterization of the time course of atrial changes presents an intervention window before remodeling progresses to changes that are difficult to reverse. Given that the medium to long-term efficacy of antiarrhythmic drugs has proved poor, it is essential to seek new therapies to prevent the onset of atrial fibrillation and to effectively control recurrences of atrial fibrillation. The study of nonantiarrhythmic drugs that act on the atrial remodeling that constitutes the substrate of the arrhythmia is a new and very interesting field of research. Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors angiotension-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) seems more promising. However, from recent trials, only hypertension with structural heart disease, left ventricular dysfunction and left ventricular hypertrophy benefit from ACEIs and ARBs.

    "908": "Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in American adults. Furthermore, the incidence of congestive heart failure is on the rise as a major cause of hospitalization and mortality in this population. Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors prevent the production of angiotensin II, which has been shown to reduce mortality in patients with congestive heart failure. Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) were developed as a direct inhibitor of angiotensin II. ARBs have been shown to be effective in the treatment of patients with systolic heart failure but do not cause chronic coughing which is a common side effect of ACE inhibitors. In theory, a compound that has the combined effect of an ACE inhibitor and an ARB should be more effective in treating heart failure patients than either agents alone. Therefore, the purpose of this manuscript is to design and discuss the benefits of a new molecule, which combines captopril, an ACE inhibitor, with losartan, an ARB. In this experiment Captopril and Losartan were modified and synthesized separately and combined by homo or mono coupling. This was achieved by taking advantage of PEG (Polyethylene glycol) as a linker. It is expected that this molecule will have the combined modes of action of both ACEs and ARBs. Benefits from combination therapy include; increased efficacy, reduced adverse effects, convenience, compliance, and prolonged duration. Consequently, this combined molecule is expected to block the production of angiotensin II more efficiently and effectively. Although captopril and losartan work in the same system by blocking the effect of angiotensin II they have different action sites and mechanisms some patents are also discussed. Losartan blocks the AT1 receptor which is expressed on the cell surface, while captopril inhibits ACE, preventing production of angiotensin II, which is present in both the plasma and on the cell surface, especially on endothelial and smooth muscle cells.",

Recently, we showed therapeutic effects of the combination of lisinopril (L), an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, and spironolactone (S), an aldosterone antagonist, in mice lacking dystrophin and haploinsufficient for utrophin (utrn(+/-);mdx, het mice); both cardiac and skeletal muscle function and histology were improved when these mice were treated early with LS. It was unknown to what extent LS treatment is effective in the most commonly used DMD murine model, the mdx mouse. In addition, current standard-of-care treatment for DMD is limited to corticosteroids. Therefore, potentially useful alternative or additive drugs need to be both compared directly to corticosteroids and tested in presence of corticosteroids. We evaluated the effectiveness of this LS combination in the mdx mouse model both compared with corticosteroid treatment (prednisolone, P) or in combination (LSP). We tested the additional combinatorial treatment containing the angiotensin II receptor blocker losartan (T), which is widely used to halt and treat the developing cardiac dysfunction in DMD patients as an alternative to an ACE inhibitor. Peak myocardial strain rate, assessed by magnetic resonance imaging, showed a negative impact of P, whereas in both diaphragm and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle contractile function was not significantly impaired by P. Histologically, P generally increased cardiac damage, estimated by percentage area infiltrated by IgG as well as by collagen staining. In general, groups that only differed in the presence or absence of P (i.e. mdx vs. P, LS vs. LSP, and TS vs. TSP) demonstrated a significant detrimental impact of P on many assessed parameters, with the most profound impact on cardiac pathology.", 
    "910": "Bioactive peptides (BPs) are amino acid sequences derived from food proteins. Their relevance lies in the biological activities they have once they are released from the parent protein. BPs or protein hydrolysates can be commercialized as nutraceutical products or functional ingredients according to their activities. Different food protein sources have been researched for their potential to generate BPs. However, with the exception of lunasin (derived from soy), animal protein sources have been predominantly exploited as commercial BPs sources. On the other hand, pulses have shown diverse BP contents without further impact on their commercialization. Pulses are a rich source of protein in the human diet and their consumption has been associated with the prevention of chronic diseases. The beneficial effect in human health has been related to their micronutrients, phytochemical bioactive compounds, and recently BPs. This article reviews the current literature about pulse protein hydrolysates and BPs with proved angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitory, antioxidant, cancer preventing, and other health promoting activities. Proteolysis process is commonly achieved by digestive and microorganism enzymes.

Neonatal administration of drugs that inhibit the angiotensin II pathway encourages the expression of contractile genes and prevents aneurysm development, but does not increase compliance in SMKO aorta. We hypothesized that multidimensional mechanical changes in the aorta and/or other elastic arteries may contribute to aneurysm pathophysiology. We found that the SMKO ascending aorta and carotid artery showed mechanical changes in the axial direction. These changes were not reversed by angiotensin II inhibitors, hence reversing the axial changes is not required for aneurysm prevention. Mechanical changes in the circumferential direction were specific to the ascending aorta; therefore, mechanical changes in the carotid do not contribute to aortic aneurysm development. We also hypothesized that a published model of postnatal aortic growth and remodeling could be used to investigate mechanisms behind the changes in SMKO aorta and aneurysm development over time. Dimensions and mechanical behavior of adult SMKO aorta were reproduced by the model after modifying the initial component material constants and the aortic dilation with each postnatal time step. The model links biological observations to specific mechanical responses in aneurysm development and treatment.",

    "926": "Senescence of vascular endothelial cells is an important contributor to the pathogenesis of age-associated vascular disorders such as atherosclerosis. We investigated the effects of antihypertensive agents on high glucose-induced cellular senescence in human umbilical venous endothelial cells (HUVECs). Exposure of HUVECs to high glucose (22 mM) for 3 days increased senescence-associated- \u03b2-galactosidase (SA-\u03b2-gal) activity, a senescence marker, and decreased telomerase activity, a replicative senescence marker. The calcium channel blocker nifedipine, but not the \u03b21-adrenergic blocking agent atenolol or the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril, reduced SA-\u03b2-gal positive cells and prevented a decrease in telomerase activity in a high-glucose environment. This beneficial effect of nifedipine was associated with reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increased endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity. Thus, nifedipine prevented high glucose-induced ROS generation and increased basal eNOS phosphorylation level at Ser-1177. Treatment with N (G)-nitro-L-arginine (L-NAME) and transfection of small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting eNOS eliminated the anti-senscence effect of nifedipine. These results demonstrate that nifedipine can prevent endothelial cell senescence in an eNOS-dependent manner. The anti-senescence action of nifedipine may represent a novel mechanism by which it protects against atherosclerosis.",

Following risk adjustment with multivariable logistic regression modelling, patient related factors associated with significantly higher risks of prolonged opioid use included younger age, lower household income, specific comorbidities (diabetes, heart failure, pulmonary disease), and use of specific drugs preoperatively (benzodiazepines, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors). The type of surgical procedure was also highly associated with prolonged opioid use.

    "938": "Central \u03b12-adrenoceptors and the pontine lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPBN) are involved in the control of sodium and water intake. Bilateral injections of moxonidine (\u03b12-adrenergic/imidazoline receptor agonist) or noradrenaline into the LPBN strongly increases 0.3 M NaCl intake induced by a combined treatment of furosemide plus captopril. Injection of moxonidine into the LPBN also increases hypertonic NaCl and water intake and reduces oxytocin secretion, urinary sodium, and water excreted by cell-dehydrated rats, causing a positive sodium and water balance, which suggests that moxonidine injected into the LPBN deactivates mechanisms that restrain body fluid volume expansion. Pretreatment with specific \u03b12-adrenoceptor antagonists injected into the LPBN abolishes the behavioral and renal effects of moxonidine or noradrenaline injected into the same area, suggesting that these effects depend on activation of LPBN \u03b12-adrenoceptors. In fluid-depleted rats, the palatability of sodium is reduced by ingestion of hypertonic NaCl, limiting intake. However, in rats treated with moxonidine injected into the LPBN, the NaCl palatability remains high, even after ingestion of significant amounts of 0.3 M NaCl. The changes in behavioral and renal responses produced by activation of \u03b12-adrenoceptors in the LPBN are probably a consequence of reduction of oxytocin secretion and blockade of inhibitory signals that affect sodium palatability. In this review, a model is proposed to show how activation of \u03b12-adrenoceptors in the LPBN may affect palatability and, consequently, ingestion of sodium as well as renal sodium excretion.",

Inhibition of the RAS with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (ACE-Is) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) has proved to be a successful strategy for the treatment of hypertension and related cardiovascular disorders. However, by reducing feedback inhibition of renin release, the effects of ACE-Is and ARBs lead to an increase in plasma renin concentration (PRC) and activity (PRA), limiting a complete inhibition of the RAS. Consequently the effects of a different pharmacological strategy that completely blocks the RAS upstream has been assessed in the last years. In this context, aliskiren is the first representative of a new class of non-peptide orally active renin inhibitor that blocks the RAS at its rate-limiting step and induces a net reduction in PRA, angiotensin II and aldosterone levels. Aliskiren effectively reduces blood pressure as a monotherapy as well in combination therapy. In addition, aliskiren has a placebo-like tolerability profile at the licensed doses of 150 mg and 300 mg. Aliskiren also exhibits additive effects on blood pressure reduction when combined with drugs that lead to a reactive increase in the PRA, such as diuretics, ACE-Is or ARBs. In previous studies, aliskiren showed beneficial effects in patients with arterial hypertension and associated clinical conditions. However, later trials indicated that the use of aliskiren should be avoided in patients with renal failure or receiving ACE-Is or ARBs.

Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 degrades other peptides with a penultimate proline or alanine, including bradykinin and substance P, which are also substrates of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). During ACE inhibition, substance P is inactivated primarily by dipeptidyl peptidase-4, whereas bradykinin is first inactivated by aminopeptidase P. This study tested the hypothesis that dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibition potentiates vasodilator and fibrinolytic responses to substance P when ACE is inhibited. Twelve healthy subjects participated in this randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled crossover study. On each study day, subjects received sitagliptin 200 mg by mouth or placebo. Substance P and bradykinin were infused via brachial artery before and during intra-arterial enalaprilat. Sitagliptin and enalaprilat each reduced forearm vascular resistance and increased forearm blood flow without affecting mean arterial pressure, but there was no interactive effect of the inhibitors. Enalaprilat increased bradykinin-stimulated vasodilation and tissue plasminogen activator release; sitagliptin did not affect these responses to bradykinin. The vasodilator response to substance P was unaffected by sitagliptin and enalaprilat; however, substance P increased heart rate and vascular release of norepinephrine during combined ACE and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibition. In women, sitagliptin diminished tissue plasminogen activator release in response to substance P both alone and during enalaprilat.

Diabetic nephropathy is the most frequent cause of terminal renal failure. The first stage of its development is microalbuminuria. Without an efficient treatment 20-40% of the patients with microalbuminuria suffering from type 2 diabetes mellitus develop chronic renal failure, but only 20% of them become uremic because most of them die beforehand mainly due to cardiovascular disease. The renin-angiotensin-system, which is one of the most important elements of the regulation of blood pressure and water-salt metabolism, plays an important role in the development of diabetic nephropathy.

It is characterized by predominant C3 deposits in the mesangium and along the glomerular basement membrane (GBM). Presenting features comprise proteinuria (sometimes with nephritic syndrome), haematuria, hypertension and renal failure. C3\u00a0glomerulopathy have a poor renal prognosis with progression to end stage renal disease (ESRD) in 50% of cases during the first decade after initial presentation. Moreover, C3 deposits recur in most of cases after renal transplantation. Patients frequently have low serum C3 level attributed to the activation of the alternative pathway of complement. Animal models have confirmed the role of excessive C3 activation in the pathogenesis of C3 glomerulopathy. To date, the optimal treatment remains unknown. It is currently based on the use of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin II-receptor blockers (ARB), sometimes associated with immunosuppressive therapy.

Emergency surgery or complex procedures were excluded. Vasoplegia was assessed during the immediate postoperative period, and at 24h after surgery, and was defined as a mean arterial pressure below 50mmHg, and the need for a noradrenaline perfusion of more than 0.08\u03bcg/kg/min, monitored by cardiac output and systemic vascular resistances. The anaesthetic and cardiopulmonary bypass protocols, as well as haemodynamic management, were the same in all patients.",

Vasoplegia at 24h after surgery was correlated to preoperative angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor drug treatment and cardiopulmonary bypass duration.",

    "974": "The somatic isozyme of ACE (angiotensin I-converting enzyme) comprises two distinct zinc-dependent catalytic domains with different substrate specificities for angiotensin I (cleaved selectively by the C-domain) and bradykinin (cleaved equally efficiently by both the N- and C-domains). Classical ACEIs (ACE inhibitors) target both domains, with side effects such as cough and angio-oedema being attributed, in part, to N-domain inhibition, probably through bradykinin accumulation. We questioned whether a novel C-domain-selective ACEI (lisW-S) has anti-hypertensive effects without influencing bradykinin status. AngII (angiotensin II)-dependent hypertension was studied in mice that express active human renin in the liver (TtRhRen). Compared with wild-type littermates, TtRhRen mice displayed cardiac hypertrophy and had significantly elevated SBP [systolic BP (blood pressure)] as determined by tail cuff sphygmomanometry (150\u00b13 compared with 112\u00b15 mmHg; P<0.05) and telemetry (163\u00b13 compared with 112\u00b12 mmHg; P<0.01). Treatment with the non-selective ACEI lisinopril (1 mg/kg of body weight per day via an osmotic mini-pump for 2 weeks) reduced SBP (127\u00b13 compared with. 154\u00b16; P<0.05). Similarly, treatment with the C-domain selective ACEI lisW-S (lisinopril-tryptophan; 3.6 mg/kg of body weight per day via an osmotic mini-pump for 2 weeks) reduced BP. Treatment with lisinopril or lisW-S significantly reduced levels of AngII in kidneys (~4-fold; P<0.001). Ang-(2-8) [angiotensin-2-8)] was significantly reduced by lisinopril, but not by lisW-S. Plasma bradykinin levels were significantly increased only in the lisinopril group. These data suggest that C-domain-selective ACEIs reduce BP and AngII levels similarly to classical ACEIs. C-domain-selective ACEIs have the potential to avoid undesirable effects on the bradykinin system common to classic ACEIs and may represent a novel approach to the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "975": "Adriamycin (ADR) is commonly used for many solid tumor treatments. Its clinical utility is, however, largely limited by the adverse reactions, are known to be nephrotoxic. The mechanism by which it induces kidney damage is still not completely understood, but its nephrotoxicity might relate to increase reactive oxidant status (ROS), mitochondrial dysfunction. Until now, neurohormonal activation of it is unclear. ADR might activate the renin angiotensin system. Angiotensin-II also induced ROS and mitochondrial dysfunction. The aim of this study was to investigate whether angiotensin-II production inhibition has the protective effect on attenuation of mitochondrial function in rats with acute ADR-nephrotoxicity or not. Rats were divided into five groups as a control, ADR, co-treated ADR with captopril (CAP), co-treated ADR with Aliskren, co-treated ADR with both CAP and Aliskren groups. Creatinine kinase (CK) levels were measured at the end of treatment period. The kidneys were homogenized and biochemical measurements were made in mitochondria, cytosol. Mitochondria membrane potential (MMP) and ATP levels were determined. ADR increased CK levels and oxidative stress in mitochondria too (p<0.05). ADR significantly decreased MMP and ATP level in kidney mitochondria (p<0.05). Co-administration with ADR and Aliskren and CAP improved the dissipation of MMP (p<0.05). The decrease in ATP level was restored by treatment with inhibitors of ACE and renin. We concluded that inhibitors of angiotensin-II are effective against acute ADR induced nephrotoxicity via the restoration of MMP and ATP production and prevention of mitochondrial damage in vivo.",

Aorta and carotid were harvested and ex vivo vascular reactivity to acetylcholine (Ach) and L-cysteine (L-cys) assessed. Cystathionine-\u03b2-synthase (CBS), cystathionine-\u03b3-lyase (CSE), and 3-mercaptosulfur-transferase (3MST) expression, as well as H2S levels, were evaluated in both vascular tissues. The vascular response to Ach in both carotid and aorta was impaired in SHR (~30%, P < 0.001). S-zofenopril, but not enalapril, restored this response, while L-cys-induced relaxation was enhanced. CSE expression in vessels and tissue/plasma H2S levels were restored to WKY values in SHRs receiving S-zofenopril. In contrast, CBS and 3MST expression were not modified by treatments. S-zofenoprilat, an active metabolite of S-zofenopril, releases H2S in a 'cell-free' assay and it directly relaxed vessels in vitro in a concentration-dependent manner (P < 0.001). In vivo administration of R-zofenoprilat diasteroisomer, which does not inhibit ACE, did not modify blood pressure; nonetheless, it retained the beneficial effect on SHR vascular function as well as restored plasma/tissue H2S levels.", 
    "978": "Our findings establish that S-zofenopril improves vascular function by potentiating the H2S pathway in a model of spontaneous hypertension. This novel mechanism, unrelated to ACE inhibition and based on H2S release, could explain the beneficial effects of sulfhydrylated ACE inhibitors reported in the clinical literature.", 
    "979": "Diagnosis of hypertension and clinical decisions regarding its treatment are typically based upon daytime clinic blood pressure (BP) measurements, occasionally supplemented by wake-time patient self-assessment. Yet, correlation between BP level and target organ damage, cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, and long-term prognosis is higher for ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) measurements. Numerous studies consistently reveal CVD events are better predicted by the asleep than awake or 24 h BP means. In addition, when the asleep BP mean is adjusted by the awake mean, only the former is a significant independent predictor of outcome. Endogenous circadian rhythms explain statistically and clinically significant ingestion time differences in efficacy, duration of action, safety and/or effects on the daily BP pattern of most hypertension medications and their combinations. Bedtime versus morning-time ingestion of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, independent of drug terminal half-life, both better reduces asleep BP and normalizes the daily BP profile into a more normal dipper pattern. The recently completed prospective outcome MAPEC Study verifies therapeutic restoration of the normal sleep-time BP decline, a novel therapeutic goal most effectively achieved by ingestion of the entire daily dose of \u2a7e 1 conventional hypertension medications at bedtime, best decreases CVD morbidity and mortality. Our findings indicate around-the-clock ABPM is a clinical necessity to accurately detect abnormal sleep-time BP and assess CVD risk, and that hypertension ought to be managed by a bedtime therapeutic strategy, preferably one including medication that antagonizes the activities and actions of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.",

Computational models provide a tool for investigating the impact of underlying disease mechanisms on the response to antihypertensive therapies with different mechanisms of action. We present the development, calibration, validation, and application of an extension of the Guyton/Karaaslan model of blood pressure regulation. The model incorporates a detailed submodel of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), allowing therapies that target different parts of this pathway to be distinguished. Literature data on RAAS biomarker and blood pressure responses to different classes of therapies were used to refine the physiological actions of ANG II and aldosterone on renin secretion, renal vascular resistance, and sodium reabsorption. The calibrated model was able to accurately reproduce the RAAS biomarker and blood pressure responses to combinations of dual-RAAS agents, as well as RAAS therapies in combination with diuretics or calcium channel blockers. The final model was used to explore the impact of underlying mechanisms of hypertension on the blood pressure response to different classes of antihypertensive agents. Simulations indicate that the underlying etiology of hypertension can impact the magnitude of response to a given class of therapy, making a patient more sensitive to one class and less sensitive others. Given that hypertension is usually the result of multiple mechanisms, rather than a single factor, these findings yield insight into why combination therapy is often required to adequately control blood pressure.",

Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) has been shown to improve myocardial function in patients with HF and cardiac dyssynchrony. However, reports on CRT in diabetic elderly patients are limited and controversial. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the functional role of T2DM on the effectiveness of CRT at advanced age. In this single-center prospective study, we enrolled 72 HF patients over 75\u00a0years old with and without T2DM who underwent CRT implant. Detailed clinical and instrumental data, including cardiac ultrasound analysis, 6-min walk test, and quality-of-life evaluation, were collected at baseline and at 1-year follow-up. At the time of implantation, 44.4\u00a0% of patients had T2DM, of which 62.5\u00a0% were well controlled with diet and hypoglycemic drugs and 37.5\u00a0% were treated by insulin therapy. After 1\u00a0year, CRT improved myocardial ventricular geometry and functional capacity in a comparable proportion of diabetic and non-diabetic patients alongside with a similar amelioration in the functional status.

    "982": "The authors summarize some current views regarding the pharmacologic therapies of hepatorenal and cardiorenal syndromes, respectively. A common pathogenetic background of the two edematous disorders is outlined, consisting in reduced effective blood arterial volume \u2011 due to the splanchnic vasodilation in the hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) and to the fall in cardiac output and the rise in central venous pressure in cardiorenal syndrome (CRS). In both diseases, arterial underfilling elicits multiple water- and sodium- retentive mechanisms, by activating sympathetic nervous system and stimulating both rennin-angiotensin-aldosterone and vasopressin systems. These neurohormonal adjustments subsequently concur to a vasomotor nephropathy which originates - as a same kind of vasoconstrictor reflex renal response \u2011 from the splanchnic vasodilation, in the case of liver cirrhosis, or from the fall in renal perfusion and filtration gradients in the case of cardiorenal syndrome. Despite these pathogenetic similarities, the renal insufficiency of HRS compared to that of CRS is treated using diametrically opposite approaches: actually withdrawal of diuretics and administration of vasoconstrictor agents is the first choice in the case of HRS, while CRS is tackled by forcing diuretic regimen and by continuing vasodilator treatment with ACE-inhibitors. The pros and cons of these strategies \u2011 which are still matter of debate among the physicians and researchers \u2011 are then succinctly presented and discussed.",

This study aims to evaluate the association of low-dose aspirin with mortality and morbidity risk in a large community-based cohort. Methods and Results- This was a retrospective cohort study of patients attending an HF disease management program. Aspirin use at baseline and its association with mortality and HF hospitalization in the population was examined. Of 1476 patients (mean age, 70.4\u00b112.4 years; 63% men), 892 (60.4%) were prescribed aspirin. Low-dose aspirin (75 mg/d) was prescribed to 828 (92.8%) patients. Median follow-up time was 2.6 (0.8-4.5) years. During the follow-up period, 464 (31.4%) patients died. In adjusted analysis, low-dose aspirin use was associated with reduced mortality risk compared with nonaspirin use (hazard ratio=0.58; 95% confidence interval, 0.46-0.74), and this was confirmed by a propensity-matched subgroup analysis. Low-dose aspirin use was associated with reduced risk of HF hospitalization compared with nonaspirin use in the total population (adjusted hazard ratio=0.70; 95% confidence interval, 0.54-0.90). In adjusted analysis, there was no difference in mortality or HF hospitalization between high-dose aspirin users (>75 mg/d) and nonaspirin users. Conclusions- In this study, low-dose aspirin therapy was associated with a significant reduction in mortality and morbidity risk during long-term follow-up. These results suggest that low-dose aspirin may have a continuing role in secondary prevention in HF and underline the need for more trials of low-dose aspirin use in HF.",

Thus, it is classified asa dystrophinopathy. The disease onset is before age 5 years. Patients with DMD present with progressive symmetrical limb-girdle muscle weakness and become wheelchair dependent after age 12 years. (2)(3). On the basis of some research evidence,cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure are usually seen in the late teens in patients with DMD. Progressive scoliosis and respiratory in sufficiency often develop once wheelchair dependency occurs. Respiratory failure and cardiomyopathy are common causes of death, and few survive beyond the third decade of life. (2)(3)(4)(5)(6)(7). On the basis of some research evidence, prednisone at 0.75 mg/kg daily (maximum dose, 40 mg/d) or deflazacort at 0.9 mg/kg daily (maximum dose, 39 mg/d), a derivative of prednisolone (not available in the United States), as a single morning dose is recommended for DMD patients older than 5 years, which may prolong independent walking from a few months to 2 years.

There is a paucity of data on the long-term sequelae of persistent hypertension in children, but it is known that children with hypertension have evidence of end organ damage and are at risk of hypertension into adulthood. The prevalence of hypertension in children is rising, most likely due to a concurrent rise in obesity rates. In children with hypertension, non-pharmacological measures are often recommended as first-line therapy, but a significant proportion of children will eventually require pharmacological treatment to reduce blood pressure, especially those with evidence of end organ damage at presentation or during follow-up.

No randomised trial was identified that evaluated the effectiveness of antihypertensive medications on target end organ damage. The trials were of variable quality and most were funded by pharmaceutical companies.Among the angiotensin receptor blockers, candesartan (one trial, n = 240), when compared to placebo, reduced systolic blood pressure by 6.50 mmHg (95% confidence interval (CI) -9.44 to -3.56) and diastolic blood pressure by 5.50 mmHg (95% CI -9.62 to -1.38) (low-quality evidence).

    "1023": "Cognitive decline in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with elevated brain levels of amyloid \u03b2 protein (A\u03b2), particularly neurotoxic A\u03b2(1-42). Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) can degrade A\u03b2(1-42), and ACE overexpression in myelomonocytic cells enhances their immune function. To examine the effect of targeted ACE overexpression on AD, we crossed ACE(10/10) mice, which overexpress ACE in myelomonocytes using the c-fms promoter, with the transgenic APP(SWE)/PS1(\u0394E9) mouse model of AD (AD\u207a). Evaluation of brain tissue from these AD\u207aACE(10/10) mice at 7 and 13 months revealed that levels of both soluble and insoluble brain A\u03b2(1-42) were reduced compared with those in AD\u207a mice. Furthermore, both plaque burden and astrogliosis were drastically reduced. Administration of the ACE inhibitor ramipril increased A\u03b2 levels in AD\u207aACE(10/10) mice compared with the levels induced by the ACE-independent vasodilator hydralazine. Overall, AD\u207aACE(10/10) mice had less brain-infiltrating cells, consistent with reduced AD-associated pathology, though ACE-overexpressing macrophages were abundant around and engulfing A\u03b2 plaques. At 11 and 12 months of age, the AD\u207aACE(10/WT) and AD\u207aACE(10/10) mice were virtually equivalent to non-AD mice in cognitive ability, as assessed by maze-based behavioral tests. Our data demonstrate that an enhanced immune response, coupled with increased myelomonocytic expression of catalytically active ACE, prevents cognitive decline in a murine model of AD.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of opiorphin through intravenous injection (i.v.) on mean arterial pressure (MAP) regulation. To investigate the bioactivity of opiorphin, a rat cannulation model was developed for MAP measurement and blood sampling. In our present study, opiorphin (200-700 nmol/kg) increased MAP in dose-related and time-dependent manner in conscious rats, which associated highly with the elevation of angiotensin II (AngII) levels in serum. Furthermore, the MAP elevation induced by opiorphin was completely blocked by AngII receptor antagonist valsartan and partially attenuated by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril. Finally, we tested the effect of opiorphin in hypoxia condition, which exhibited that opiorphin reversed hypoxia induced hypotension in conscious rats. Taken together, these results indicated that opiorphin may play an important role in the modulation of blood pressure through AngII dependent pathway, which may help future development of potent clinical therapeutics for emergency treatment.",

Animals administered a high-dose HBOC experienced coronary artery constriction and depression of cardiac function. Exposure of isolated coronary arteries or human umbilical vein endothelial cells to high-dose HBOC caused impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation, increased endothelial cell necrosis/apoptosis, and elevated NAD(P)H oxidase expression (gp91(phox), p47(phox), p67(phox), and Nox1) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. All observed adverse outcomes could be suppressed by the ACE inhibitor captopril (100 \u03bcM). Co-incubation with free radical scavenger tempol or NAD(P)H oxidase inhibitor apocynin had no effect on captopril action, suggesting that the positive effects of captopril are ROS- and NAD(P)H oxidase dependent. ACE inhibition by captopril also contributed to these effects. In addition, bioavailable nitrite oxide (NO) reduced by high-dose HBOC was preserved by captopril. Furthermore, HBOC, at concentrations greater than 0.5%, inhibited large conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channel currents in vascular smooth muscle cells in a dose-dependent manner, although captopril failed to improve current activity, providing additional evidence that captopril's effects are mediated by the endothelium, but not by the smooth muscle.",

Pepsin gave peptides with the best IC50 values (mean value on three species 186 \u00b1 10 \u03bcg/mL), followed by pepsin + trypsin (198 \u00b1 16 \u03bcg/mL), chymotrypsin (213 \u00b1 83 \u03bcg/mL), trypsin (405 \u00b1 54 \u03bcg/mL), corolase PP (497 \u00b1 32 \u03bcg/mL), umamizyme (865 \u00b1 230 \u03bcg/mL), and flavourzyme (922 \u00b1 91 \u03bcg/mL). The three species showed similar activity scales, but after pepsin + trypsin and chymotrypsin treatments, L. luteus peptide mixtures resulted to be significantly the most active. This investigation indicates that lupin proteins may be a valuable source of ACE-inhibitory peptides, which may explain the activity observed in experimental and clinical studies and foresee the application of lupin proteins into functional foods or dietary supplements.",

Calcium channel blockers dilate both artery and arteriole that increases end-organ perfusion, thus possessing few side effects especially for the elderly hypertensive patients. The safety of calcium channel blockers was well established. In this paper, important clinical evidence supporting the effectiveness of calcium channel blockers and improving cardiovascular endpoints will be reviewed. Calcium channel blockers protect end-organs from hypertensive vascular injury. In addition, calcium channel blockers show non-inferiority to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers and diuretics regarding cardiovascular endpoints. Furthermore, calcium channel blockers may have superiority to betablockers. Although cardiovascular protection by calcium channel blockers largely depends on their potent blood pressure lowering ability, including central blood pressure, calcium channel blockers can manifest blood pressure-independent vascular protection. Thus, calcium channel blockers are basic antihypertensive drugs, and constitute the treatment of choice to obtain target blood pressure for most hypertensive patients, especially for high-risk population and those with resistant hypertension. An intense treatment of hypertension with adequate doses of calcium channel blockers is mandatory to improve cardiovascular prognosis.", 
    "1038": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) progressively increases the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in line with its severity. Recent studies have revealed that albuminuria and proteinuria in CKD are risk factors for both ESRD and CVD. Accordingly, reductions in albuminuria and proteinuria are associated with a trend in reduced renal death and cardiovascular events. Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors, including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers are recommended as first-choice drugs for the treatment of hypertensive patients with CKD according to several guidelines. However, monotherapy is not sufficient to control blood pressure, particularly in patients with CKD, highlighting the need for combination drug therapy. Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) reduce blood pressure and are useful antihypertensive drugs. Three types of CCBs--the L-, T-, and Ntypes-- are in clinical use. In renal tissue, L-type calcium channels are present only in the afferent arterioles, while N-type and T-type calcium channels are located in both efferent and afferent arterioles. Therefore, CCBs that block either T-type or N-type calcium channels may exert renoprotective effects by dilating the efferent artery and protecting the glomerulus from hyperfiltration injury. It has been established that T-type CCBs exert a renal protective action by ameliorating glomerular microcirculation via vasodilatory activity on both afferent and efferent arterioles. Additionally, blockade of the T-type Ca channel suppresses inflammatory processes, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and oxidative stress. Such effects of T-type CCBs seem to provide good efficacy in terms of the progression of renal outcome and the prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with CKD.", 
    "1039": "Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) with angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACEI) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) has become a major therapeutic tool. Due to internal counter-regulation, however, this system cannot be fully blocked by targeting only one of its components. Instead of increasing the doses of an ACEI, an ARB or a renin inhibitor, blocking RAS at two successive levels neutralizes the consequences of internal counter-regulation and thus provides a more complete blockade with more pronounced biological effects. Additive effects on blood pressure lowering and on renin secretion during combined administration of RAS blockers were first demonstrated in normotensive subjects and in various experimental models of hypertension, heart failure and renal failure. Although combined RAS blockade provided an additional hemodynamic response and more complete neutralization of the cellular effects of angiotensin II, no benefit was observed in terms of cardiovascular or renal protection in heart disease (heart failure, post-myocardial infarction, high vascular risk) or kidney disease (diabetic nephropathy). Moreover, more complete RAS blockade is risky in conditions where blood pressure and renal perfusion are renin-dependent (renal failure and hypotension) and also in hypoaldosteronism (hyperkalemia). The European, French and US. health agencies have contraindicated combined RAS blockade because of its unfavorable risk-benefit balance, especially in patients with diabetes or renal failure.",

This study examined the role of ACE2 in the hyperfiltration associated with diabetes. Streptozotocin diabetes was induced in male C57BL6 mice and ACE2 knockout (KO) mice. C57BL6 mice were further randomized to receive the selective ACE2 inhibitor MLN-4760. After 2 wk of study, animals were subjected to micropuncture experiments. The renal reserve was further assessed in C57BL6 mice and ACE2 KO mice after exposure to a high-protein diet. The induction of diabetes in wild-type mice was associated with increased renal ACE2 activity, hyperfiltration, and renal hypertrophy. On micropuncture, diabetes was associated with increased tubular free flow and stop-flow pressure, enhanced tubuloglomerular feedback reactivity, and an increased maximal response indicative of increased glomerular hydrostatic capillary pressure. Each of these increases were prevented in diabetic ACE2 KO mice and diabetic mice treated with a selective ACE2 inhibitor for 2 wk. However, unlike chronically treated animals, ACE2 inhibition with MLN-4760 had no acute effect on stop-flow pressure or tubuloglomerular feedback reactivity. ACE2 KO mice also failed to increase their creatinine clearance in response to a high-protein diet. The results of our study suggest that ACE2 plays a key role in the recruitment of the renal reserve and hyperfiltration associated with diabetes.",

K. marxianus LF permeate was fractionated by semipreparative high performance liquid chromatography and 35 peptides contained in the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory fractions were identified by using an ion trap mass spectrometer. On the basis of peptide abundance and common structural features, six peptides were chemically synthesized. Four of them (DPYKLRP, PYKLRP, YKLRP, and GILRP) exerted in vitro inhibitory effects on ACE activity and effectively decreased systolic blood pressure after oral administration to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Stability against gastrointestinal enzymes suggested that the sequence LRP could contribute to the in vivo effects of parental peptides. Finally, there were reductions in circulating ACE activity and angiotensin II level in SHRs after either DPYKLRP or LRP intake, thus confirming ACE inhibition as the in vivo mechanism for their antihypertensive effect.",

The Avoiding Cardiovascular Events through Combination Therapy in Patients Living with Systolic Hypertension (ACCOMPLISH) trial was completed five years after the JNC 7 and demonstrated a 20\u00a0% advantage in cardiovascular risk reduction when blood pressure was lowered using the single-pill combination of benazepril-amlodipine compared to benazepril-hydrochlorothiazide (Jamerson et al. 359(23):2417-28 [1]). This new and significant finding provided compelling evidence that the long-standing preference for diuretics as initial therapy could be refuted, but it may also be relevant to the lower-than-expected reduction in coronary disease related events (compared to stroke) observed for decades prior to the ACCOMPLISH approach to therapy. The JNC 8 panel members recently published their recommendations, and while the group did not recommend benazepril-hydrochlorothiazide over other combinations, they did highlight the findings of ACCOMPLISH, rating the primary ACCOMPLISH paper as \"good.\" The American Society of Hypertension position paper and the European Hypertension Society guidelines endorse such combinations as a first-line agent for patients with stage 2 hypertension.

Vehicle and a non-hypotensive dose of enalapril (0.03 mg/kg) were administered at the beginning of the reperfusion period. A neurological deficit score (NDS) was determined for all rats at the end of the reperfusion period. Then, brain oedema formation was investigated using the wet-dry weight method and BBB permeability was evaluated on the basis of extravasation of Evans blue (EB) dye. In addition, oxidative stress was assessed by measuring reduced glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in brain homogenates. 3. Inhibition of ACE by enalapril significantly reduced NDS and decreased brain oedema formation (P < 0.05 for both). Disruption of the BBB following ischaemia resulted in considerable leakage of EB dye into the brain parenchyma of the ipsilateral hemispheres of vehicle-treated rats. Enalapril significantly (P < 0.05) decreased EB extravasation into the lesioned hemisphere. Enalapril also augmented anti-oxidant activity in ischaemic brain tissue by increasing GSH concentrations and significantly (P < 0.05) attenuating the increased MDA levels in response to ischaemia. 4. In conclusion, inhibition of ACE with a non-hypotensive dose of enalapril may protect BBB function and attenuate oedema formation via anti-oxidant actions.",

    "1061": "In this paper, we present a pipeline to perform improved QSAR analysis of peptides. The modeling involves a double selection procedure that first performs feature selection and then conducts sample selection before the final regression analysis. Five hundred and thirty-one physicochemical property parameters of amino acids were used as descriptors to characterize the structure of peptides. These high-dimensional descriptors then go through a feature selection process given by the binary matrix shuffling filter (BMSF) to obtain a set of important low-dimensional features. Each descriptor that passes the BMSF filtering also receives a weight defined through its contribution to reduce the estimation error. These selected features served as the predictors for subsequent sample selection and modeling. Based on the weighted Euclidean distances between samples, a common range was determined with high-dimensional semivariogram and then used as a threshold to select the near-neighbor samples from the training set. For each sample to be predicted, the QSAR model was established using SVR with the weighted, selected features based on the exclusive set of near-neighbor training samples. Prediction was conducted for each test sample accordingly. The performances of this pipeline are tested with the QSAR analysis of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and HLA-A*0201 data sets. Improved prediction accuracy was obtained in both applications. This pipeline can optimize the QSAR modeling from both the feature selection and sample selection perspectives. This leads to improved accuracy over single selection methods. We expect this pipeline to have extensive application prospect in the field of regression prediction.",

ANG-(1-7) can ameliorate remodeling after myocardial injury. The aims of this study are to (1) develop mass spectrometric (MS) approaches for the assessment of ANG processing by APA within the myocardium; and (2) investigate the role of APA in cardiac ANG-(1-7) metabolism after myocardial infarction (MI) using sensitive MS techniques. MI was induced in C57Bl/6 male mice by ligating the left anterior descending (LAD) artery. Frozen mouse heart sections (in situ assay) or myocardial homogenates (in vitro assay) were incubated with the endogenous APA substrate, ANG II. Results showed concentration- and time-dependent cardiac formation of ANG III from ANG II, which was inhibited by the specific APA inhibitor, 4-amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid. Myocardial APA activity was significantly increased 24 h after LAD ligation (0.82 \u00b1 0.02 vs. 0.32 \u00b1 0.02 \u03c1mol\u00b7min(-1)\u00b7\u03bcg(-1), MI vs. sham, P < 0.01).

    "1077": "Adiponectin is secreted by the adipose tissue and is downregulated in states of obesity and insulin resistance. There is a growing body of evidence indicating that adiponectin has renoprotective effects and protects against the development of albuminuria in rodent experiments. Adiponectin crossing the glomerular filtration barrier possibly inhibits inflammation, fibrosis and oxidative stress in kidneys through activation of AMP-activated protein kinase. Moreover, microalbuminuria is a well established early sign of progressive cardiovascular and renal disease, even in subjects with preserved glomerular filtration rate. Studies investigating the relationship between serum adiponectin levels and urinary albumin excretion rate (UAE) have yielded conflicting data and the mechanisms underlying the interplay between adiponectin and albuminuria remain to be elucidated. This article constitutes a critical review attempting to clarify any remaining confusion about this matter. Furthermore, this article examines the clinical significance of adiponectin-albuminuria interplay, suggesting that adiponectin is possibly involved in the development of albuminuria that is associated with obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease and may mediate, at least in part, the actions of medical treatments that influence UAE, such as angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, thiazolidinediones, fenofibrate and diet. Further studies to investigate more thoroughly the renoprotective role of adiponectin in the human setting should be carefully planned, focusing on causality and the possible influence of adiponectin on the development of albuminuria in specific clinical settings.",

We assessed the ACE inhibitory potential of various North Atlantic fish species and evaluated the effect of dietary supplementation of fish hydrolysates on the blood pressure of spontaneously hypertensive rats. Fish samples were hydrolyzed using simulated gastrointestinal digestion, and ACE inhibitory activity was evaluated using an ACE inhibitory activity assay. In vivo anti-hypertensive effects were evaluated by administering hydrolysates of wild Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L.), haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus L.), or farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) to 10-week-old male, spontaneously hypertensive rats for 4 weeks.

The solid materials are stable amorphous solids in which both moieties of enalapril maleate are ionically bonded to the polymer. Their aqueous dispersions exhibited controlled release over more than 7h in physiologic saline solution, being ionic exchange the fundamental mechanism that modified the extent and rate of drug release. Intestinal permeation of enalapril maleate was 1.7 times higher in the presence of the cationic polymer. This increase can be related with the capacity to adhere the mucosa due to the positive zeta potential of the complexes. As a consequence bioavailability was significantly improved (1.39 times) after oral administration of the complexes.

Compared with placebo, RAAS inhibitors reduced all-cause mortality overall [n = 20\u2009573, relative risk ratio (RR) 0.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86-0.95, P = 0.0003], in the group with no WRF (n = 18\u2009209, RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.83-0.99, P = 0.04), and in the WRF group (n = 2364, RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.62-0.84, P < 0.0001). Compared with no WRF, WRF was associated with increased all-cause mortality; however, this was less in the RAAS inhibitor group (n = 8905, RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.10-1.36, P = 0.0003) than in the placebo group (n = 9304, RR 1.52, 95% CI 1.37-1.69, P < 0.00001).", 
    "1104": "WRF shortly after randomization is associated with worsened outcomes compared with no WRF; however, the reduction in all-cause mortality associated with the use of RAAS inhibitors was significantly greater in the presence of WRF than in the no WRF group. Clinicians should not be deterred from using RAAS inhibitors in the setting of WRF.", 
    "1105": "Long-term therapy of hypertension may influence mineral status in patients. However, drug-micronutrient interactions are largely unexplored in practice. This study intended to evaluate the effect of hypotensive monotherapy on iron, zinc, and copper levels, as well as on selected biochemical parameters, in newly diagnosed patients with hypertension, and to assess the influence of diet with optimal mineral levels on the mineral balance in these subjects.", 
    "1106": "Forty-five patients, aged 18-65 years with diagnosed essential hypertension, beginning monotherapy treatment with diuretics, calcium antagonists, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and \u03b2-blockers, were employed. Over three months, the patients underwent monotherapy (stage II). Next, patients were randomly divided into a diet group (of 27 subjects) and a control group (of 18 subjects). In this stage, which lasted one month, patients were given the same drug but also followed an optimal mineral-content diet (for the diet group), or else continued drug use without any change in diet (for control group) (stage III). Lipids, glucose, ceruloplasmin, and ferritin--along with superoxide dismutase and catalase activities--were assayed in serum. Iron, zinc, and copper concentrations in serum, erythrocytes, and urine were determined using flame atomic absorption spectrometry. Blood pressure was measured. Diet intake was monitored at each stage.", 
    "1107": "It was found that the zinc level in serum significantly decreased following treatment, and that the use of the optimal-mineral diet during antihypertensive treatment markedly increased zinc serum concentration. After treatment, a significant increase in zinc excretion in the urine was observed. Glucose levels in the serum of patients in stage II were significantly higher than in the baseline. In patients in the diet group, glucose levels markedly decreased. Moreover, a negative correlation was found between serum glucose and zinc levels in patients.", 
    "1108": "Antihypertensive treatments should include monitoring of mineral status. It seems that the zinc balance of patients on long-term therapy with hypotensive drugs may benefit from an optimal-mineral diet.", 
    "1109": "Many patients suffer from both heart and lung diseases. The choice of medical drugs should not only be driven by the clinical and prognostic effects on the target organ but should also be selected based on the effects on the respective other organ. Beta blockers and statins have both beneficial and harmful effects on the respiratory system. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and amiodarone can cause severe lung damage. Low-dose thiazides and calcium antagonists are first-line medications in hypertensive asthma patients but beta blockers should be avoided. Theophyline should be used with caution in patients with known cardiac disease. Glucocorticosteroids can cause cardiovascular symptoms while the phosphodiesterase inhibitor roflumilast appears to have no relevant cardiovascular side effects. Anticholinergic drugs have both favorable and unfavorable cardiovascular (side) effects. Short-acting beta-2 sympathomimetic drugs (SABA) and macrolides in particular can trigger arrhythmia and some SABAs are associated with a higher incidence of myocardial infarction. Detailed knowledge of the effects of drugs used for the treatment of lung and heart diseases on the respective other organ and the associated complications and long-term effects are essential in providing optimal medical care to the many patients who present with both respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.", 
    "1110": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is located in several tissues and is highly expressed in renal proximal tubules, where it degrades the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II (ANG II) to ANG-(1-7). Accumulating evidence supports protective roles of ACE2 in several disease states, including diabetic nephropathy. A disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM) 17 is involved in the shedding of several transmembrane proteins, including ACE2. Our previous studies showed increased renal ACE2, ADAM17 expression, and urinary ACE2 in type 2 diabetic mice (Chodavarapu H, Grobe N, Somineni HK, Salem ES, Madhu M, Elased KM. PLoS One 8: e62833, 2013). The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of insulin on ACE2 shedding and ADAM17 in type 1 diabetic Akita mice. Results demonstrate increased renal ACE2 and ADAM17 expression and increased urinary ACE2 fragments (\u224870 kDa) and albumin excretion in diabetic Akita mice. Immunostaining revealed colocalization of ACE2 with ADAM17 in renal tubules. Renal proximal tubular cells treated with ADAM17 inhibitor showed reduced ACE2 shedding into the media, confirming ADAM17-mediated shedding of ACE2. Treatment of Akita mice with insulin implants for 20 wk normalized hyperglycemia and decreased urinary ACE2 and albumin excretion. Insulin also normalized renal ACE2 and ADAM17 but had no effect on tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3 (TIMP3) protein expression. There was a positive linear correlation between urinary ACE2 and albuminuria, blood glucose, plasma creatinine, glucagon, and triglycerides. This is the first report showing an association between hyperglycemia, cardiovascular risk factors, and increased shedding of urinary ACE2 in diabetic Akita mice. Urinary ACE2 could be used as a biomarker for diabetic nephropathy and as an index of intrarenal ACE2 status.", 
    "1111": "To determine differences in adherence to secondary prevention guidelines (pharmacological interventions) among coronary heart disease (CHD) patients between a Chinese medicine (CM) hospital and a general hospital in a Chinese city.", 
    "1112": "Medical records of 200 patients consecutively discharged from the CM hospital and the general hospital for CHD were reviewed to determine the proportions of eligible patients who received antiplatelet agents, \u03b2-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and statins at discharge. The effects of patient characteristics and hospital type on the use of these medicines were estimated using logistic regression models.", 
    "1113": "Patients discharged from the CM hospitals were older; more likely females; had greater history of hyperlipidemia, cerebrovascular diseases and less smoker (P<0.01 or P<0.05). They were less likely to receive coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention, and had a longer length of stay than those discharged from the general hospital (P<0.01 or P<0.05). There were no significant differences in antiplatelet agents (96% vs. 100%, P=0.121) or statins (97.9% vs. 100%, P=0.149) use between the CM hospital and the general hospital. In multivariable analyses that adjusted for patient characteristics and hospital type, there was no significant difference in use of \u03b2-blockers between the CM hospital and the general hospital. In contrast, patients discharged from the CM hospital were less likely to receive ACE inhibitors/ARBs compared with those discharged from the general hospital (odds ratio: 0.3, 95% confidence interval: 0.105-0.854).", 
    "1114": "In this study, the CM hospital provides the same quality of care in CHD for prescribing evidence-based medications at discharge compared with another general hospital except for ACE inhibitors/ARBs use.", 
    "1115": "Aim of the present study was to compare the effectiveness of two renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors in arterial stiffness reduction in previously untreated hypertensive patients.", 
    "1116": "In this open label study, 154 na\u00efve, or not treated in the last six months hypertensive patients were randomly assigned to receive aliskiren 300 mg or ramipril 5 mg daily. Six weeks after the initiation of treatment, patients were evaluated for blood pressure (BP) control. Patients with SBP \u2265140 and/or DBP \u226590 mmHg were assigned to an adjunct of 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide as combination treatment. A re-evaluation of BP control was done after another 6 weeks. Individuals with BP \u2265140/90 mmHg were further administered amlodipine 5 mg. The final evaluation was performed six months after the start of the study. Twenty four-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was carried out and the ambulatory arterial stiffness index (AASI) was calculated at baseline and after 6 months of treatment.", 
    "1117": "Aliskiren-based therapy, as compared with ramipril-based therapy reduced BP to a similar degree: 13\u00b111 vs. 12\u00b111 mmHg reduction in systolic (P=0.34) and 8\u00b17 vs. 7\u00b17 mmHg reduction in diastolic BP (P=0.44). AASI was reduced by 0.04\u00b10.1 in the aliskiren group and by 0.02\u00b10.2 in the ramipril group. AASI reduction did not differ significantly in the two groups (P=0.13).", 
    "1118": "In hypertensive patients, aliskiren-based treatment as well as ramipril-based treatment appears to have a beneficial effect on arterial stiffness. As arterial stiffness is an important modifiable risk factor, our findings highlight the value of aliskiren beyond BP lowering properties.", 
    "1119": "A number of studies have demonstrated the rates of overall and aneurysm-related mortality and morbidity in Western populations. The cardiovascular risk factors influencing postoperative outcome have been also reported. Until recently, little has been known about the prognosis in this patient cohort in the Chinese population. We evaluated the independent predictors of mortality and morbidity in abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) patients undergoing elective surgical treatment and emphasized whether the coronary artery revascularization could have any effect on the overall mortality and morbidity in patients following the current guideline recommendation.", 
    "1120": "A total of 386 patients (174 women) undergoing surgery in Beijing Anzhen Hospital from January 2008 to June 2010 were enrolled (mean age (70.6\u00b110.5) years). Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed to compare the mortality and morbidity of AAA patients with coronary artery revascularization and those without. A Cox proportional hazards model was constructed to identify clinical factors associated with two-year outcomes. The primary outcomes were death from any cause, the pre-specified morbidity was re-hospitalization for pulmonary conditions, congestive heart failure, angina, ischemic/hemorrhagic stroke.", 
    "1121": "During the two-year follow-up, 34 patients died and 65 experienced re-hospitalization with pulmonary conditions, congestive heart failure, angina, or ischemic/hemorrhagic stroke. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that the AAA patients with cardiac revascularization had no higher incidence of overall mortality and major morbidity than those without (log-rank test P = 0.35 and P = 0.40, respectively). Cox proportional hazards regression analysis showed that level of lowdensity lipoprotein (HR, 4.06; 95% CI: 1.19-18.7, P = 0.027) and AAA size (HR, 2.18; 95% CI: 1.28-11.65, P = 0.036) were independently associated with the incidence of overall mortality. Long-term use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, statins, AAA size and systolic blood pressure were independent predictors of the secondary pre-specified outcomes.", 
    "1122": "Coronary artery revascularization following the guideline recommendations did not increase the mortality and morbidity of Chinese with AAA who were undergoing repair. Absence of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and statins, AAA size, and systolic blood pressure were powerful predictors of the clinical events."
