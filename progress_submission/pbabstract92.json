    "0": "Systemic hypertension is a common clinical problem in the elderly. There is emerging evidence to suggest that with careful utilization of antihypertensive drugs, blood pressure can be lowered in the elderly population. Whether isolated systolic hypertension should be treated aggressively remains an unanswered question despite the evidence that systolic hypertension can cause certain cardiovascular complications. An elderly patient with hypertension and concomitant coronary artery disease merits proper blood pressure control with appropriate drugs to prevent progression of coronary disease. The therapeutic objective is not only to lower the blood pressure but to accomplish this goal with drugs which are likely to have a favorable effect on coronary artery disease. Changing trends in the drug therapy of hypertension indicate that calcium antagonists and beta-blocking drugs offer a therapeutic advantage in elderly hypertensive patients with coronary artery diseases.", 
    "1": "Nine patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and ten non-diabetic patients with mild hypertension were treated with enalapril 20 mg daily. None had overt nephropathy, though 4 diabetic subjects had microalbuminuria. Subjects with the highest baseline albumin excretion rates (AER) showed the greatest fall on therapy. Metabolic control of diabetes did not deteriorate. Enalapril had no significant effect on AER in NIDDM patients with AER below 20 micrograms/minute or in the non-diabetic group.", 
    "2": "The antihypertensive efficacy and tolerability of lisinopril, a new long acting angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, and nifedipine, in a retard formulation, were compared in a randomized six month double-blind study, in 45 patients with essential hypertension. Lisinopril, 20 to 80 mg once daily and nifedipine retard, 20 to 40 mg twice daily, were equally effective in lowering blood pressure and controlling hypertension. There were however significantly more adverse effects (P less than 0.01) reported with nifedipine. No significant differences were observed between groups for laboratory values, although the lisinopril group showed a significant reduction in urinary protein excretion compared to baseline values. Lisinopril and nifedipine have equal efficacy in the treatment of essential hypertension but in this study lisinopril was better tolerated than nifedipine.", 
    "3": "It has been suggested that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may also act through the renal prostaglandin (PG) system; moreover, it has been shown that nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are capable of reducing the antihypertensive activity of ACE inhibitors. Sixteen essential hypertensive patients (WHO stages, I-II, eight on a low-sodium diet and eight on a high-sodium diet) were treated with enalapril, 20 mg/day per os, for 4 days. On days 3 and 4, ibuprofen, 1,200 mg/day per os, was also given. Enalapril reduced blood pressure, particularly in the group on the low-sodium diet. Urinary 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, an indicator of renal PGI2 production (determined by HPLC-RIA), increased in the first few hours after enalapril in the low-sodium group. Ibuprofen did not reduce the antihypertensive effect of enalapril, nor did it affect plasma renin activity or plasma aldosterone. Only a slight reduction in 6-keto-PGF1 alpha excretion was observed after enalapril plus ibuprofen. It is suggested that the effect of enalapril on urinary 6-keto-PGF1 alpha excretion is largely dependent on factors such as sodium intake.", 
    "4": "Using a placebo baseline, positive controlled, double-blind, randomized titration to effect our study protocol, we assessed the antihypertensive actions of enalapril, hydrochlorothiazide, and their combination in 37 patients with moderate essential hypertension. Patients were maintained on their regular diets and received a placebo for 4 weeks. Patients with moderate systemic hypertension were randomized to receive enalapril monotherapy at a dose of 10 mg twice daily (n = 16), hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy at a dose of 25 mg twice daily (n = 15), or combination therapy consisting of 10 mg enalapril and 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide twice daily (n = 6). Therapy could be titrated to twice the starting dose. All treatment regimens reduced blood pressure, but only one patient had blood pressure normalized (diastolic blood pressure less than or equal to 90 mmHg) with enalapril (7%), two patients with hydrochlorothiazide (15%), and 80% of patients with combination therapy. The patients who had not achieved normal blood pressure received combination treatment, and after 8 additional weeks, more than 70% showed normal blood pressure. After one year of combination therapy, 92% of the patients continue to have normal blood pressure. Both the monotherapy and combination regimens were very well tolerated in this study. In conclusion, enalapril, hydrochlorothiazide, and their combination are effective in reducing blood pressure in patients with moderate hypertension. However, monotherapy is successful in normalizing blood pressure only in a small percentage of patients. Combination therapy achieved normalization of blood pressure in almost all patients, suggesting that most patients on regular diets with moderate hypertension may require a diuretic-ACE inhibitor combination rather than monotherapy to achieve effective blood pressure control.", 
    "5": "Both angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and potassium-sparing diuretics tend to increase serum potassium levels. This retrospective study was undertaken to assess whether these two types of agents can nevertheless be combined safely. Twelve hypertensive patients were treated for 1-70 months (mean = 17) with an ACE inhibitor together with a potassium-sparing diuretic (spironolactone, n = 10; amiloride, n = 2). In addition, eight patients also took a thiazide or a loop diuretic. Nine patients had a normal and three a slightly impaired renal function. No clinically relevant hyperkalemia was observed during the course of the study. These data suggest that it is not impossible to combine an ACE inhibitor with a potassium-sparing diuretic, as long as renal function is normal and serum potassium concentration is monitored closely.", 
    "6": "A patient is described who developed mild hyponatraemia on two occasions when treated with bendrofluazide alone, but severe hyponatraemia when treated with the combination of enalapril and bendrofluazide.", 
    "7": "It was found that the molecular mass of the angiotensin-converting enzyme from seal (Phoca groenlandica) lungs determined by electrophoresis in 7.5% PAAG in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate is 150 kD. The enzyme has a pH optimum with respect to hippuryl-L-histidyl-L-leucine at 7.3--7.5; KM is 1.2 mM. The enzyme is inhibited by the substrate to form a nonproductive ES2 complex with the dissociation constant (Ks') of 4.8 mM. The activation of the seal angiotensin-converting enzyme in the presence of NaCl was studied. The bradykinin-potentiating factor (SQ 20881) inhibits the seal enzyme with a high efficiency (IC50 = 2.5.10(-8) M). Monoclonal antibodies to the angiotensin-converting enzyme from human lungs do not interact with its seal lung counterpart, which points to the species specificity of the angiotensin-converting enzyme.", 
    "8": "The present study examined the actions of spiraprilic acid, a new non-sulfhydryl angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor upon aortic compliance (AC) in anesthetized dogs. Enalaprilic acid was examined for comparative purposes. AC was determined via sonomicrometric determination of the ratio of aortic systolic-diastolic diameter (mm) and arterial pulse pressure (mmHg). One AC unit (ACU) equals 10(-3) mm/mmHg. In non-thiazide pretreated animals, spiraprilic acid (1 mg/kg i.v.), caused a sustained hypotensive response of 21 +/- 3 mmHg (P less than .05). At the same time, aortic systolic and diastolic dimensions were reduced from basal values of 8.17 +/- 0.45 and 7.95 +/- 0.40 mm by 0.19 +/- 0.07 (P less than .05) and 0.29 +/- 0.10 mm (P less than .05), respectively. The aortic systolic-diastolic dimension rose significantly by 0.10 +/- 0.01 mm. Since pulse pressure was unchanged, AC rose from a basal value of 4.6 +/- 0.8 ACU by 1.7 +/- .3 ACU (P less than .05). Similar effects were observed with enalaprilic acid. In dogs pretreated orally with 5 mg/kg hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) twice daily for 3 days, spiraprilic and enalaprilic acids caused slightly greater falls in blood pressure (34 +/- 7 and 30 +/- 4 mmHg, respectively) than in nonpretreated dogs. However, the onset of the hypotension effect was more rapid for both ACE inhibitors in HCTZ-pretreated dogs. Effects of spiraprilic and enalaprilic acid upon aortic dimensions were similar to those observed in non-HCTZ pretreated animals. The data illustrate that the ACE inhibitors spiraprilic and enalaprilic acids not only lower blood pressure but also enhance large artery compliance.", 
    "9": "To determine the nature of the resultant effect on blood pressure when angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are combined with other hypotensive agents in the treatment of uncomplicated essential hypertension, two randomized, double-blind, crossover trials were conducted. In each trial there were four treatment phases, each 4 weeks in duration, comprising a 2 X 2 factorial experiment. Twenty-one patients completed the first study in which the effects of enalapril (10 mg twice daily) were compared with hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg twice daily), with the two drugs in combination and with placebo. All blood pressure parameters were reduced in the three active treatment phases compared with placebo (P less than 0.001). Enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide were equally effective and in combination their hypotensive effects were fully additive. Sixteen patients completed the second study which compared the effects of enalapril (20 mg daily), atenolol (50 mg daily), the two drugs in combination and placebo. All blood pressure parameters were again reduced in all phases compared with placebo (P less than 0.001). Enalapril and atenolol were also equally effective, but in combination their hypotensive effects were less than fully additive, with attenuation of the potential additive response by 30-50%. These results indicate that a diuretic-ACE inhibitor combination can be expected to have a greater hypotensive effect than a beta-blocker-ACE inhibitor combination. Both hydrochlorothiazide and atenolol increased plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) concentrations (P less than 0.01), suggesting that ANP could contribute to the hypotensive effects of these two drug classes.", 
    "10": "The effects of hypertension and its treatment on the function and structure of arteries have been extensively studied, but no data are yet available on the effect of hypotensive drugs on the large arteries in normotensive rats. Two groups of 11-month-old normotensive breeder male rats were treated for 5 months, one with an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (MK-421, 2 mg/kg per day; n = 10) and the other with dihydralazine (15 mg/kg per day; n = 8). A group of 14 rats served as controls. Blood pressure was recorded every 14 days by the tail-cuff method. At the end of the treatment period (5 months), the rats were killed under anaesthesia and the descending thoracic aorta was removed and fixed. The different components of the aorta were assessed by automated morphometric image analysis after specific coloration of elastin (orceine), collagen (sirius red) and nuclei (haematoxylin after periodic acid oxidation. Both the ACE inhibitor and dihydralazine caused similar decreases in systolic blood pressure (SBP) compared with controls. This hypotensive effect was associated with a reduction in medial thickness, from 120 +/- 15 microns in controls to 104 +/- 9 microns in ACE inhibitor-treated and 103 +/- 10 microns in dihydralazine-treated normotensive rats. Elastin density significantly increased in the two treatment groups but the greatest increase was in the dihydralazine-treated group (P less than 0.001). Elastin fibre thickness increased significantly in the dihydralazine-treated group only. Collagen density was not significantly modified by either treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "11": "The effect of adding placebo, a calcium antagonist, nicardipine and a thiazide diuretic, chlorthalidone, each for 2 weeks, to ongoing treatment with the ACE inhibitor, enalapril was evaluated in seven patients with essential hypertension. Compared with placebo, nicardipine and chlorthalidone both significantly enhanced the antihypertensive effect of enalapril: average blood pressure reductions over 8 h were respectively 26/16 and 33/17 mm Hg (supine) but the time-course of these augmented effects was significantly different. In particular, blood pressure control with the addition of nicardipine, despite apparently being at steady state, was significantly attenuated during the latter part of the dosage interval and therefore was less well sustained at 24 h. In contrast, an effect throughout 24 h appeared possible with the chlorthalidone-enalapril combination.", 
    "12": "Twelve essential hypertensive patients with normal renal function were treated once daily with a new angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril maleate, for about two months. In all patients, the drug-induced changes in blood pressure (BP), systemic and renal hemodynamics, plasma renin activity (PRA), and urine aldosterone (UA) were evaluated. Mean arterial pressure was significantly lowered. No significant changes in cardiac index, heart rate, and stroke index were observed, while peripheral vascular resistance index was significantly decreased. Plasma and blood volumes were not significantly altered. The effects on renal hemodynamics consisted of a significant increase in renal plasma flow (RPF), a decrease in renal vascular resistance, and no change in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). UA excretion was significantly reduced during enalapril therapy. The drug was well tolerated, and no side effects were observed. In summary, enalapril is able to reduce blood pressure through a vasodilatatory effect without change in cardiac output. It increases renal blood flow with no change in glomerular filtration rate.", 
    "13": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) was measured in tissue homogenates from the African lungfish and six species of air-breathing teleosts (Heteropneustes fossilis, Clarias batrachus, Channa gachua, Anabas testudineus, Notopterus chitala, and Monopterus cuchia) using a standard spectrophotometric assay. In most species, the highest levels of ACE activity were found in the respiratory organs (gills and/or accessory respiratory organs). ACE was also found in heart and kidney tissues from most species and occasionally in liver. Converting enzyme was not found in skin or skeletal muscle from any species and only in blood from H. fossilis and brain from C. batrachus. Captopril, a potent inhibitor of mammalian ACE, inhibited enzymatic activity from all tissues except C. gachua heart and liver and A. testudineus heart. As fish make the transition from aquatic to aerial respiration the gill microcirculation is usually reduced in size and the accessory respiratory organs become elaborated and occupy a more central position in the vascular tree. The presence of ACE in accessory respiratory organs of air-breathing fish appears to greatly enhance the metabolic efficiency of this enzyme on circulating substrates.", 
    "14": "Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors have become an important element in the antihypertensive armamentarium. They are well tolerated and efficacious in essential and secondary hypertension, and may open new insights into the pathophysiology of the hypertensive state.", 
    "15": "Hypertension was induced in marmosets by ligating the minor branch of one renal artery. The blood pressure (BP), measured by a tail-cuff method, increased to hypertensive levels within 4-5 weeks and the maximum increases occurred after 4-15 weeks (BP, mean +/- s.e.m. was 120 +/- 3 and 152 +/- 6 mmHg before and 10 weeks after ligation, respectively; n = 9). There was a small increase in plasma renin activity (PRA) after 2 weeks, but PRA decreased thereafter and there was no correlation between PRA and BP. The renin inhibitor CGP 29,287 (Ciba-Geigy Ltd., Basle, Switzerland, synthesized by D.B. Rinker and P. B\u00fchlmayer; 1 mg/kg i.p.) and the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, enalaprilat (Merck Sharp and Dohme, USA.; 2 mg/kg i.p.), lowered the BP of the hypertensive marmosets to normotensive levels. These results indicate that although PRA is not elevated in this primate model of hypertension, BP is dependent on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "16": "The role of rat intestinal angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE; E.C 3.4.15.1) in the digestion and absorption of dietary protein was investigated. Enzyme activity was associated with the brush-border membrane fraction, with the highest activity in the proximal to midregion of the small intestine. Preliminary enzyme characterization studies were carried out using purified brush-border membrane preparations. When a variety of N-blocked synthetic peptides were used as potential substrates for ACE, activity was highest with those containing proline at the carboxy terminal position. The hydrolytic rates observed with these prolyl peptides were comparable to those observed when major digestive peptidases of the brush-border membrane such as aminopeptidase N and dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV were assayed. When isolated rat jejunum was perfused in vivo with solutions of Bz-Gly-Ala-Pro, the dipeptide Ala-Pro was the main hydrolytic product detected in the perfusates. Absorption rates of the constituent amino acids, alanine and proline, depended on the concentration of peptide perfused. Captopril, an active site specific ACE inhibitor, significantly inhibited hydrolysis and absorption of constituent amino acids from Bz-Gly-Ala-Pro. These results show that intestinal brush-border membrane ACE functions as a digestive peptidase in addition to its role as a regulator of biologically active peptides in other tissues.", 
    "17": "The effects of enalapril alone and in combination with the cyclooxygenase inhibitors sulindac and indomethacin on blood pressure (BP), plasma aldosterone, renin activity and converting enzyme activity were evaluated in 29 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension, 26 of whom had low plasma renin activity. Patients were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups. All patients underwent a 4-week placebo phase (phase I), then received enalapril (20 mg BID) for 4 weeks (phase II). In phase III, group I (n = 10) continued on enalapril alone; group II (n = 9) received sulindac 200 mg BID plus enalapril, and group III (n = 10) received indomethacin 50 mg BID plus enalapril, all for 4 weeks. Enalapril lowered BP significantly (mean supine BP 149/100 in phase I vs. 134/90 in phase II, p less than 0.05) without inhibiting aldosterone production. The BP effect was not blunted by concomitant administration of sulindac or indomethacin. Enalapril lowered converting enzyme activity to 25% to 30% of baseline and tended to increase renin activity. In the 10 patients who received indomethacin (group III), the effects of enalapril alone and enalapril plus indomethacin on urinary excretion of 6-keto prostaglandin F1 alpha (PGF1 alpha), a stable metabolite of prostacyclin (PGI2), were examined. Enalapril increased urinary 6-keto PGF1 alpha in group III from 118 +/- 23 to 194 +/- 38 ng/g creatinine (p less than 0.05), while addition of indomethacin reduced 6-keto PGF1 alpha to basal levels (138 +/- 26 ng/g creatinine).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "18": "The aim of the study was to investigate beta adrenoceptor modulation of norepinephrine release from sympathetic nerves in rat isolated kidney. After preincubation with [3H]norepinephrine, the renal nerves were stimulated at 1 Hz. The stimulation induced (S-I) outflow of radioactivity was taken as an index of norepinephrine release. Isoproterenol (0.1 microM) enhanced the S-I outflow of radioactivity. This effect was abolished by the beta-2 adrenoceptor blocking drug ICI 118551 (0.1 microM) but unaltered by the beta-1 adrenoceptor blocking drug atenolol (0.3 microM). In the presence of a high concentration of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (5 microM), isoproterenol failed to enhance the S-I outflow of radioactivity. However, a lower concentration of captopril (0.1 microM), which totally abolished the facilitatory effect of angiotensin I (0.1 microM) on the S-I outflow of radioactivity, failed to alter the facilitatory effect of isoproterenol. Angiotensin II (0.03 microM) enhanced markedly the S-I outflow of radioactivity and in the presence of the angiotensin II receptor blocking drug saralasin (0.1 microM) this facilitatory effect was reduced markedly. Saralasin did not alter the facilitatory effect of isoproterenol. These results suggest that stimulation of prejunctional beta-2 adrenoceptors on renal sympathetic nerve endings enhances norepinephrine release. This effect is independent of local angiotensin II production and does not involve activation of prejunctional angiotensin II receptors within the rat kidney. However, the inhibitory effect of a high concentration of captopril (5.0 microM) on beta-2 adrenoceptor-mediated facilitation of norepinephrine release remains to be clarified.", 
    "19": "Recent observations suggest that calcium antagonists may enhance the antihypertensive effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Twelve essential hypertensives who had blood pressures greater than 160/90 after a minimum of 6 weeks of monotherapy with the ACE inhibitor enalapril 20 mg daily received additional treatment with nicardipine 30 mg t.i.d. and placebo, each for 2 weeks, in a double-blind crossover study. The combination of nicardipine with enalapril was well tolerated. The addition of the first dose of nicardipine was associated with significant reductions (p less than 0.05) in blood pressure during the first 4 h: from a baseline of 165/99 to 128/80 (supine) at 2 h after nicardipine as compared with 167/101-146/90 following placebo. Two weeks of combined treatment with nicardipine and enalapril significantly reduced the predosing blood pressure, 12 h after the last dose of nicardipine (158/96 as compared with 172/106 with placebo), and there were further significant reductions in blood pressure during the subsequent dosage interval. The profile of plasma ACE inhibition and the pharmacokinetics of enalaprilat were unaffected by the addition of nicardipine. These results suggest that nicardipine and enalapril are an effective and well-tolerated antihypertensive combination.", 
    "20": "Vasodilating drugs such as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may extend life expectancy in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether long-term therapy (365 days) with enalapril (ENAL, an ACE inhibitor), would prolong life in rats with a healed myocardial infarction (MI), an experimental model with hemodynamic characteristics of CHF. Seven days after sham or coronary ligation, when the healing phase of MI was well underway, 132 rats (75 sham, 57 MI) were randomized to receive either enalapril in the drinking water (17-25 mg/L, approximately 1.0 mg/kg/day) or tap water. The date of spontaneous death was recorded, and heart weight and MI size (by planimetry) were determined. Serum ENAL, total ACE concentration, and angiotensin and methoxamine pressor responses were quantified in 12 survivors. Long-term enalapril prolonged survival (p = 0.014) with a median 50% survival of 164 (164-165) days, compared to 84 (64-104) days in rats receiving tap water. There were twice as many MI rats alive at the end of one year on angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition (ACEI) therapy as compared to the untreated group. The average MI size (39-40%) was not different between groups, and there was a significant inverse correlation between date of death and MI size (r = 0.7-0.8) in both treatment groups. Cardiac hypertrophy was evident in all MI rats. Serum ENAL levels, after one year, were at the clinically relevant concentration (2.3 ng/ml) and total serum ACE (inhibitor removed) doubled to 4,300 nmol/h/ml.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "21": "Intrarenal administration of angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors carried out in norepinephrine- (NE; 2-4 micrograms/kg per min) or in angiotensin II- (ANG II; 60-90 ng/kg per min) induced acute hypertension in conscious unrestrained rabbits. Intrarenal administration of captopril (5 mg/kg) and MK-422 (1 mg/kg) caused no significant effect when injected intravenously. However, it showed a prompt and marked depressor effect in NE- but not in ANG II-induced hypertension. This effect was not observed after intrarenal infusion of saralasin (2 and 10 micrograms/kg per min) in NE-induced hypertension. While pretreatment with aprotinin or indomethacin failed to inhibit the depressor action, 2-bromoethylamine hydrobromide (BEA), which is known to induce necrosis of the renal papilla, produced complete abolition of the depressor effect of an intrarenal injection of MK-422 in NE-induced hypertension. These results indicate that the kidney plays an important role in the depressor action of ACE inhibitors in NE- but not in ANG II-induced acute hypertension, and that this effect may be related to the potentiation of antihypertensive renomedullary lipids rather than the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system or the potentiation of bradykinin or prostaglandins.", 
    "22": "One hundred and fifty two patients with chronic heart failure caused primarily by left ventricular dysfunction were followed prospectively in an open study for a mean period of 21 months. The effects of several clinical variables on subsequent outcome were examined, including the effects of treatment, which was determined by the clinician caring for the patient and was not randomly allocated. In order of importance, frequent ventricular extrasystoles, non-treatment with amiodarone, low mean arterial pressure, and a diagnosis of coronary artery disease were associated with a poor prognosis, with each of these variables providing extra predictive information independently of the others. Initial serum potassium concentration and treadmill exercise time also carried further weak but independent prognostic information. Neither treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors nor digoxin appeared to affect outcome. Left ventricular function (as reflected by M mode echocardiography) and the dose of diuretic also failed to predict outcome. There did, however, appear to be a reduction in the frequency of sudden death when angiotension converting enzyme inhibitors were given. Further studies are required to confirm the adverse prognostic significance of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with heart failure and the possible benefit associated with amiodarone treatment.", 
    "23": "To determine the roles of endogenous enkephalinase (EC.3.4.24.11) in regulating tachykinin-induced contraction of airway smooth muscle, the authors studied the effects of the enkephalinase inhibitor leucine-thiorphan on the contractile responses to substance P (SP), neurokinin A (NKA) and neurokinin B (NKB) in isolated ferret tracheal smooth muscle segments. Leucine-thiorphan shifted, in concentration-dependent fashions, the dose-response curves to all tachykinins to lower concentrations. Leucine-thiorphan changed the rank order of tachykinin potency from NKA greater than SP greater than NKB to NKA = NKB greater than SP. Removal of the epithelium slightly enhanced the contractile responses to SP and NKA but not to NKB. Atropine shifted the dose-response curves of all tachykinins to higher concentrations. Each tachykinin increased the contractile response to electrical field stimulation (5 Hz, 20 sec of duration, 20 V) in a dose-dependent fashion. This effect was not altered by hexamethonium, indomethacin, BW755C or naloxone but was potentiated by leucine-thiorphan and inhibited by the tachykinin receptor antagonist (D-Pro2, D-Trp7,9)-SP and by atropine. Because tachykinins did not affect contractile responses to acetylcholine significantly, their effects were probably on presynaptic postganglionic nerves. Captopril, bestatin and leupeptin did not alter contractile responses, suggesting that angiotensin converting enzyme, aminopeptidases and serine proteinases did not modulate tachykinin-induced effects. Enkephalinase immunofluorescence was found in the smooth muscle and epithelium and confirmed the authors' finding of enkephalinase-like activity in the muscle. The results suggest that tracheal enkephalinase is an important modulator of tachykinin-induced effects.", 
    "24": "Zinc, the catalytically essential metal of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), has been replaced by cobalt(II) to give an active, chromophoric enzyme that is spectroscopically responsive to inhibitor binding. Visible absorption spectroscopy and magnetic circular dichroic spectropolarimetry have been used to characterize the catalytic metal binding site in both the cobalt enzyme and in several enzyme-inhibitor complexes. The visible absorption spectrum of cobalt ACE exhibits a single broad maximum (525 nm) of relatively low absorptivity (epsilon = 75 M-1 cm-1). In contrast, the spectra of enzyme-inhibitor complexes display more clearly defined maxima at longer wavelengths (525-637 nm) and of markedly higher absorptivities (130-560 M-1 cm-1). The large spectral response indicates that changes in the cobalt ion coordination sphere occur on inhibitor binding. Magnetic circular dichroic spectropolarimetry has shown that the metal coordination geometry in the inhibitor complexes is tetrahedral and of higher symmetry than in cobalt ACE alone. The presence of sulfur----cobalt charge-transfer bands in both the visible absorption and magnetic circular dichroic spectra of the cobalt ACE-Captopril complex confirm direct ligation of the thiol group of the inhibitor to the active-site metal.", 
    "25": "In view of the pharmacological and chemical reasons for using ACE-inhibitors to treat diabetic hypertension, a group of 40 outpatients were treated with Enalapril. The sample consisted of 20 outpatients, 6 males, 14 females aged 48-76 (mean age 63.75), 18 of whom had type II and 2 type I diabetes and 11 under treatment by diet and hypoglycaemic drugs or insulin. All these patients presented slight or moderate essential arterial hypertension (diastolic pressure less than 115 mmHg). For about one year 17 of the patients were given 20 mg/die Enalapril and the remaining three 10 mg/die in a single morning dose. In 16 cases no other treatment was given. In 4 a non-potassium conserving diuretic was also given. Check-ups before six months into and at the end of treatment showed: a statistically significant reduction in systolic (p less than 0.05) and diastolic (p less than 0.01) pressure. In contrast no significant change was noted in heart beat, glycaemia before or after meals, body weight, glycosylated haemoglobin or any other blood chemical parameter considered. In one case only there was a slight increase in proteinuria that was however present at the start of treatment. As far as side effects are concerned there was one case of cardiac palmus during treatment and one case of coughing that regressed totally when treatment was suspended but nothing else of significance. It should be noted that the antidiabetic treatment remained unchanged throughout the period considered in most cases and at most was subjected to minimal qualitative and quantitative adjustments.", 
    "26": "The effect of inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) on standard cough challenge was investigated in a double-blind, randomised study in sixteen normal volunteers. Captopril (25 mg) or matched placebo was given by mouth 2 h before inhalation of nebulised distilled water, citric acid, and incremental doses of capsaicin (0.5-20 mumol/l). Distilled water and citric acid challenge were not significantly changed by captopril pretreatment. However, captopril significantly shifted the dose-response curve to capsaicin inhalation. The geometric mean dose of capsaicin causing 20 coughs/min was 1.3 mumol/l for captopril and 2.8 mumol/l for placebo pretreatment (p = 0.04). Cough is a recognised side-effect of ACE inhibitors; the observation that cough challenge is changed by these drugs in normal subjects implies a role for ACE in the cough reflex, possibly by metabolism of substrates other than angiotensin I.", 
    "27": "In the past decade several new antihypertensives have been marketed. Some, like the new beta blockers, are related to pre-1977 drugs, while others, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, alpha blockers, and calcium channel blockers, are entirely new classes. While the newer agents have definite advantages, the extent of these benefits must be weighed against their cost. Drug costs for a two-drug regimen of captopril and diltiazem are 25 times those of hydrochlorothiazide and propranolol. The new beta blockers seem to have modest overall advantages: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are useful for patients who cannot accept a diminution in exercise tolerance; calcium channel blockers are useful for elderly hypertensives who have a contraindication for thiazides. Hypertension is being increasingly better controlled, with a concomitant reduction in cardiovascular mortality. The challenge for the next decade will be to achieve reductions in atherosclerotic, as well as hypertensive, complications without interfering with the users' quality of life. In this paper the authors review the new drugs and indicate what groups of patients might be benefited by them.",

The dicarboxylic acids having the pseudoequatorial amino groups at the 6-position and the pseudoequatorial hydrophobic substituents at the 2- or 3-position of the chair conformation of the thiazepinone ring had potent in vitro inhibitory activity. The monoester monoacids having the hydrophobic substituents at the 2-position suppressed pressor response to angiotensin I for a longer duration than those having the substituents at the 3-position when administered orally. The structure-activity relationship was studied by conformational energy calculations of the thiazepinone ring.", 
    "29": "The effect of YS980, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, on the generation of medullary prostaglandins E2 and F2 alpha was examined. At concentrations of 0.2 mM and below, YS980 enhanced prostaglandin F2 alpha synthesis at the expense of prostaglandin E2. At concentrations of 0.4 mM or more, YS980 inhibited synthesis of both prostaglandins E2 and F2 alpha markedly. These results suggest that YS980 has the potential to modulate prostaglandins E2 and F2 alpha synthesis by the kidney and that this effect may represent some pharmacological action of the drug.", 
    "30": "The relationships between various properties of inhibitors of enkephalinase (membrane metalloendopeptidase, EC 3.4.24.11) i.e., enzyme inhibition, protection of endogenous enkephalins, antinociceptive activity and stimulation of locomotor activity was investigated by comparing the relative potencies of the two enantiomers of Thiorphan and acetorphan, its parenterally active prodrug. In vitro (R)- and (S)-Thiorphan were almost equipotent in inhibiting enkephalinase activity (Ki, 1.7 and 2.2 nM, respectively) or thermolysin activity (Ki, 13 and 6 microM, respectively) whereas the (R)-isomer was 44-fold less potent than the (S)-isomer on ACE activity (Ki 4800 and 110 nM, respectively). When tested on slices of rat globus pallidus in the presence of bestatin, to block the aminopeptidase pathway of enkephalin degradation, both Thiorphan enantiomers ensured a complete protection of endogenous (Met5)enkephalin released by depolarization and a suppression of the increase in the extracellular levels of Tyr-Gly-Gly, a characteristic enkephalin metabolite. These two effects occurred at EC50 values of the two enantiomers (10 nM in both cases), consistent with the idea that they were due to enkephalinase inhibition. After i.v. administration of the acetorphan enantiomers to mice, the enkephalinase activity of a rapidly prepared striatal membrane fraction was reduced in a dose-dependent manner with similar \"ex vivo\" ED50 values (1.0 and 0.3 mg/kg for the (R)- and (S)-isomer, respectively). In contrast the ACE activity of the same preparation was reduced in a significant manner only by (S)-acetorphan (ED50 value of 11 mg/kg).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "31": "Treatment of hypertension is changing rapidly because drugs with greater specificity are being developed and knowledge is evolving concerning factors that determine responses to available drugs. For almost a decade US physicians have relied on national guidelines called Stepped-Care. Step 1 calls for using either a diuretic or a beta blocker; in subsequent steps other drugs are added. Because of the new drugs and the new knowledge it is likely that Step 1 will soon be broadened to include many other drugs. The short-term changes in Step-1 will be based upon those factors now known to influence pressure responsiveness: age--young vs old; race--black vs white; type--renovascular vs essential; and severity--mild-to-moderate vs severe. In young hypertensives, much evidence suggests a dominant neurogenic component of central origin; therefore, a central sympatholytic drug or an alpha-beta receptor blocker seem to be preferable as firstline drugs. Hypertension, primarily systolic, in elderly patients responds well to diuretics or calcium channel blockers. Mild-to-moderate hypertension in blacks is particularly responsive to diuretics, while beta blockers are relatively ineffective. Renovascular hypertension is predominantly caused by increased angiotensin II, so converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition is indicated in unilateral stenosis. The hallmark of severe hypertension is vasoconstriction, so a vasodilator (nifedipine, minoxidil, or an ACE inhibitor) is indicated as first treatment, not a diuretic or a beta blocker alone. Long term changes will depend on development of drugs with specificity for newly, or better defined, pressor mechanisms.", 
    "32": "The increasing number of patients with both cardiac and renal disease makes it important for the clinician to bear in mind the effect of both renal failure and peritoneal or hemodialysis on the handling of drugs. Guidelines are available for specific medications; however, they must be used in the light of the patient's individual response and metabolism.", 
    "33": "According to the W.H.O. criteria (160/95 mmHg), arterial hypertension is present in about one third of diabetic patients. But the W.H.O. criteria are not appropriate in insulin-dependent diabetics. There is increasing evidence that a slight increase of blood pressure values may have a deleterious effect on various localizations of diabetic angiopathy. Arterial blood pressure is a major predictive factor for stroke or death due to coronary heart disease. The incidence and prevalence of diabetic retinopathy are significantly correlated with systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure values. In patients with incipient diabetic nephropathy, a slight elevation of blood pressure values is usually observed, an antihypertensive treatment may reduce albumin excretion rate and may prevent clinical diabetic nephropathy. Antihypertensive treatment is the more effective and the best tolerated of all interventions dedicated to reduce albumin excretion. Calcium antagonists and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are at the present time the drugs to be used in the treatment of hypertensive diabetic patients as they are more effective and better tolerated than the usual antihypertensive agents. A part from their antihypertensive effect, they also improve cardiac, cerebral and intra-renal haemodynamics.", 
    "34": "Plasma renin activity was estimated in 11 infants with severe congestive heart failure. The infants had congenital heart disease with left to right shunts and were receiving diuretic treatment. Plasma renin activity was measured by radioimmunoassay of generated concentrations of angiotensin I. The mean (SD) plasma renin activity was 84 (21) ng angiotensin I/ml/hour, which is considerably above normal infant values. A hyperactive renin-angiotensin system may be detrimental in these patients. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors may be of value in treating infants with severe congestive heart failure.", 
    "35": "We investigated the pressor sensitivities to vasopressin, angiotensin II, and methoxamine of intact and ganglion-blocked rats that had been treated 21 days earlier with streptozotocin or saline. No differences in blood pressure or heart rate responses to vasopressin or angiotensin II were found between the intact groups when these peptides were administered intravenously in equimolar doses. After ganglion blockade a significant enhancement in pressor responsiveness to both vasopressin and angiotensin II was observed in the control groups, but in the streptozotocin-treated animals no enhancement in pressor sensitivity to vasopressin was found. Furthermore, although a significant augmentation of the responses to angiotensin II was observed, it was smaller than that seen in the ganglion-blocked control group. Neither group showed enhanced pressor responsiveness to methoxamine. These results indicate that the previously observed diminished contributions from endogenous vasopressin and the renin-angiotensin system to blood pressure recovery following ganglion blockade in streptozotocin-treated rats may have been due, at least in part, to diminished pressor responsiveness.", 
    "36": "Neurohumoral systems are activated as compensatory mechanisms in congestive heart failure (CHF). A close correlation has been reported between the renin angiotensin and prostaglandin systems in CHF. Furthermore, serum sodium concentration provided an excellent index of hormonal status. In this study, these relations were examined after acute and chronic blockade of renin angiotensin system with captopril. Eight patients with advanced CHF (New York Heart Association III or IV) were studied. Before captopril treatment, all hormone levels were elevated. Mean plasma renin activity was 24 +/- 7 ng Al/ml/hour, angiotensin concentration was 221 +/- 11 pg/ml and aldosterone concentration was 82 +/- 17 pg/ml. Plasma PGE2 metabolite was 1,425 +/- 321 pg/ml. A close correlation was observed between plasma angiotensin II and PGE2 metabolite levels (r = 0.7); inverse correlations existed between serum sodium concentration and PGE2 metabolite levels (r = -0.9) and with plasma renin activity (r = -0.6). Captopril therapy reduced the plasma angiotensin II level to 38 +/- 6 pg/ml and aldosterone concentration to 15 +/- 3 pg/ml, but did not affect plasma renin activity (31 +/- 10 ng Al/ml/hour) when measured in 1 week. Paradoxically, PGE2-metabolite levels increased further (to 3,031 +/- 346 pg/ml) despite blockade of the renin angiotensin system. Serum sodium concentration no longer correlated with hormone levels. These effects were sustained at 2 months of follow-up. Thus, captopril caused a dissociation between the renin angiotensin system and prostaglandin. The activation of prostaglandin is probably due to captopril's effect on prostaglandin biosynthesis and may contribute to captopril's sustained efficacy in CHF.", 
    "37": "We investigated the effect of converting enzyme inhibition (CEI) on the relationship between renal perfusion pressure (RPP) and steady-state plasma renin activity (PRA) in uninephrectomized conscious dogs on normal-salt (80 meq Na+/day) and low-salt (10 meq Na+/day) diets. Stimulus-response curves for the renal baroreceptor were determined by measuring the steady-state PRA while the RPP was lowered and then held constant by an inflatable cuff placed around the renal artery. On each diet the control stimulus-response curve can be described by two lines intersecting at a threshold pressure; in the higher pressure range PRA is relatively insensitive to changes in RPP, while in the lower pressure range PRA is very responsive to changes in RPP. On the normal-salt diet CEI significantly increases the sensitivity of PRA to RPP in the responsive range without affecting the threshold pressure itself or the values of PRA at pressures greater than the threshold pressure. On the low-salt diet CEI also increases the sensitivity of PRA to RPP significantly in the responsive range; we were unable to determine the effect of CEI on PRA at RPPs greater than the threshold pressure in the low-salt state because CEI causes a significant drop in blood pressure under these circumstances. The effect of CEI was significantly greater in the dogs on the low-salt diet than in the dogs on the normal-salt diet. Thus, CEI and salt depletion interact synergistically to increase the sensitivity of the renal baroreceptor only in the responsive range of the stimulus-response curve, i.e., at renal perfusion pressures below the threshold pressure.", 
    "38": "The biotransformation of di-acid inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme was studied in the urine of rats using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. It was found that after oral administration (10 mg/kg) of enalapril significant amounts (9.2%) of a hydrolytic metabolite of enalaprilat were excreted in urine which was identified as 2-N-alanyl-4-phenylbutanoic acid. This metabolite was present only in trace concentrations in urine after intravenous administration. This pathway was not present, however, with either ramipril or perindopril suggesting that the amide bond in these newer inhibitors is more resistant to hydrolysis than for enalapril. Glucuronidase hydrolysis of urine obtained from rats dosed with either enalapril, ramipril or perindopril indicated the absence of glucuronidate conjugates of these inhibitors in rat urine.", 
    "39": "Therapy with 10 to 40 mg once daily of enalapril, a new angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, was compared with therapy with 50 to 100 mg once daily of atenolol in a double-blind randomized multicentre trial in 180 patients with a diastolic blood pressure (determined with the patient seated) of 95 to 115 mm Hg between March 1984 and April 1986. A total of 86 patients (61 men and 25 women with a mean age of 49.4 years and a mean blood pressure [and standard deviation] at entry into the trial of 155.5 [15.7]/101.0 [6.3] mm Hg) received enalapril, and 94 patients (63 men and 31 women with a mean age of 50.9 years and a mean blood pressure at entry of 156.6 [16.6]/101.2 [5.7] mm Hg) received atenolol. After a placebo run-in period the patients received increasing dosages of medication every 2 weeks until the target diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or less was achieved on two consecutive visits, the maximum dosage was reached, or the patient withdrew because of adverse effects. At 14 weeks the mean blood pressure was 141.6 (18.0)/90.1 (9.5) mm Hg in the enalapril group (61 patients) and 140.0 (17.1)/88.4 (8.7) mm Hg in the atenolol group (54 patients). The target diastolic blood pressure was achieved on completion of therapy (between weeks 10 and 14) in 67 (77%) of the patients receiving enalapril and 75 (79%) of the patients receiving atenolol. Compliance was similar in the two groups. Seven patients withdrew because of adverse effects, three in the enalapril group and four in the atenolol group. The results suggest that once-daily monotherapy with enalapril, 10 to 40 mg, is effective in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension and is as effective as and tolerated as well as once-daily therapy with atenolol, 50 to 100 mg.", 
    "40": "The pharmacokinetics of lisinopril were determined in 6 healthy young, 6 healthy elderly and 6 elderly patients with cardiac failure. Lisinopril (5 mg day-1) was administered for 7 days. Plasma lisinopril concentration was measured at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 h on days 1 and 7 of the study. The two elderly groups had higher serum lisinopril concentrations than the healthy young subjects (P less than 0.05). There were no significant differences in any of the areas under the curve (AUC) for lisinopril plasma concentration (over time) between the healthy young and healthy elderly groups. The healthy young patients had AUC values on day 7 lower than elderly patients with cardiac failure (P less than 0.01). Creatinine clearance was correlated with lisinopril clearance (r = 0.63; P = 0.006) and with AUC on day 7 (r = -0.67; P = 0.004). Lisinopril clearance was different in the three groups (P less than 0.05): healthy young patients had the highest and elderly patients with cardiac failure the lowest values. Thus, in the elderly a reduced renal clearance of lisinopril leads to higher and more sustained blood levels. In elderly patients with cardiac failure, renal function should be estimated before lisinopril is prescribed as a reduction in dose may be appropriate.", 
    "41": "A trypsin-like serine proteinase, antigen gamma, immunologically partially identical to glandular kallikrein when run against anti-rat glandular kallikrein antiserum in immunoelectrophoresis, was purified from the rat submandibular gland. The enzyme was purified by a two-step chromatography procedure, ionexchange chromatography followed by gel filtration. The criteria for purity were one band in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and in immunoelectrophoresis, respectively. Antigen gamma had a molecular mass of 25,000 Da and consisted of two polypeptide chains with molecular masses of 14,000 and 11,000 Da. The preparation contained several isoenzymes with pI ranging from 4.1 to 4.5. The enzyme showed high specific enzyme activity against the substrate D-valyl-L-leucyl-L-arginine-4-nitroanilide (S-2266), some trypsin-like and kininogenase activity, but no angiotensin converting enzyme, kininase, or tonin activity. Amidolytic activity was increased and stabilized by the presence of detergent in the assay buffer. The pH-optimum of antigen gamma amidolytic activity was about 10. Antigen gamma was inhibited by SBTI and PMSF, whereas aprotinin had to be added in a more than 100 times higher concentration than for glandular kallikrein. The binding pattern of antigen gamma to plasma proteins was different from that of tonin and glandular kallikrein. Antiserum against antigen gamma was raised in rabbits and characterized against rat submandibular gland homogenate. Immunohistochemistry showed antigen gamma in the secretory granules of the submandibular gland granular tubular cells but only adhering to the luminal cell wall in the striated and main excretory ducts. Antigen gamma was not detected in the sublingual or parotid gland or in the kidney. Antigen gamma was demonstrated by immunoelectrophoresis in rat submandibular gland saliva. The concentration was higher in sympathetically than in parasympathetically induced secretion.", 
    "42": "The role of angiotensin II in the hormonal and renal responses to maximal exercise was investigated by using the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril. Nine male subjects performed a standardized maximal treadmill test with and without acute captopril treatment (25 mg orally). At rest, captopril elevated plasma renin activity and lowered aldosterone levels. With maximal exercise, captopril treatment reduced the increase in mean arterial blood pressure by 8 mmHg and the increase in plasma renin activity by 3.0 ng ANG I.ml-1.h-1. The responses of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), cortisol, and vasopressin to maximal exercise were not altered by captopril treatment. Although aldosterone levels were reduced at rest with captopril, during maximal exercise no difference was noted between treatments. Captopril treatment had no effects on the renal handling of salts or water during exercise. In conclusion, angiotensin II plays a role in the increase in mean blood pressure during maximal exercise in normal subjects but has no effect on the exercise responses of ACTH, vasopressin, and aldosterone or on the renal handling of salts and water.", 
    "43": "Since the liver is thought to be the major organ for the metabolism of renin, the rate-limiting enzyme in the renin-angiotensin cascade, we examined the kinetics and regulation of renin extraction by the isolated perfused rat liver. Partially purified, hog kidney renin was continuously infused into isolated rat livers perfused in a nonrecirculating manner with serum-free medium. Concentrations of renin in the portal and hepatic veins were measured by radioimmunoassay and first-pass hepatic extraction calculated. In livers from normal rats, steady-state, first-pass hepatic extraction of porcine renin ranged from 12.3 +/- 0.9 to 25.5 +/- 3.9% of the infused dose; at high renin infusion rates, hepatic extraction was saturable. Administration of captopril, a converting enzyme inhibitor, decreased hepatic extraction of renin by approximately 60%; enalaprilat, another converting enzyme inhibitor, had no effect. First-pass hepatic extraction of renin was also inhibited by the bile acid, taurocholate, in a dose-dependent manner. However, bilateral nephrectomy, which reduced endogenous plasma renin activity to unmeasurable levels, had no significant effect on hepatic extraction of renin by livers isolated from nephrectomized rats. These results demonstrate directly that the liver extracts renin in a dose-dependent and saturable manner, although the precise mechanism of uptake remains to be determined.", 
    "44": "The effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril on the proteinuria and degree of focal glomerular sclerosis hyalinosis (FSH) in chronic puromycin aminonucleoside nephropathy (PAN) were examined. Chronic PAN was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats by seven subcutaneous injections of puromycin aminonucleoside (20 mg/kg) over 10 weeks (Groups I and II). Group II rats also received enalapril 10 mg/kg/day in the drinking water throughout the study (12 weeks). Group III rats served as age-matched controls. Proteinuria was similar in Groups I and II (35.5 +/- 9.7 versus 29.1 +/- 4.1 mg protein/mg creatinine, mean +/- SEM, P greater than 0.05). Serum creatinine remained unchanged in Group I, but rose from 0.7 +/- 0.04 to 1.2 +/- 0.1 mg/dl (mean +/- SEM, P less than 0.05) in Group II. FSH was 13.8% in Group I, 12.9% in Group II (P greater than 0.05), and 0.6% in Group III. There was no significant difference in glomerular lipid content and in immunofluorescence for rat albumin, fibrinogen, IgM, IgG, and C3 between Groups I and II. ACE activity was inhibited by 94% in serum, 83% in lungs, and 92% in kidneys; and blood pressure response to. Angiotensin I challenge was decreased by 50% in rats similarly treated with enalapril versus controls. In summary, proteinuria and glomerular sclerosis in this model are not affected by ACE inhibition.", 
    "45": "The new angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, spirapril, was found to inhibit the pressor effects of angiotensin I about 10 times more potently than captopril in conscious rabbits. Its effects on systemic hemodynamics and regional blood flows were studied in two groups of 8 normotensive anaesthetized rabbits pretreated 24 h before the acute experiment either by substituting 0.45% NaCl for drinking water or with a subcutaneous injection of 20 mg kg-1 furosemide. Under barbiturate anaesthesia, regional blood flows were then measured with microspheres before and after i.v. administration of two doses of spirapril. With anaesthesia and surgery, plasma renin activity (PRA) was elevated in the salt-replete group and very high in the salt-depleted group (37 and 152 ng ml-1 h-1, respectively). Spirapril lowered blood pressure more in salt-depleted animals and increased only cardiac output and renal blood flow in salt-replete ones. Weak cardiodepression, associated with a small fall of cardiac output, was found in salt-depleted rabbits, indicating that very high angiotensin II levels may contribute to maintain cardiac function in volume-depleted animals with an activated sympathetic system. Coronary and skin blood flow decreased, and pancreatic and hepatic artery flow increased only in this group. A change in the salt balance can thus cause major differences in the responses of the peripheral circulation to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition.", 
    "46": "The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI) captopril has been shown to elevate plasma renin activity (PRA) and prostaglandin E2 levels, and to lower blood pressure and angiotensin II (AII) levels. Renin is secreted in both active and inactive forms; however, the interrelationship of these forms and responses to captopril are unclear. We proposed to determine if PRA rise induced by captopril is due primarily to release from AII inhibition, and if inactive renin is converted to active renin when PRA increases. Seven normal volunteers were given captopril, 50 mg orally, while on a moderately sodium-restricted diet (35 mEq/day). Changes in PRA and total and inactive renin, as well as prostaglandin E2, were measured. Then, on two different occasions, the captopril dose was preceded or followed by infusion of AII, to negate changes in AII induced by CEI. The dose of AII was obtained by dose-response infusion until a minimal increase in blood pressure occurred. Active renin increased with captopril alone, from 8.2 to 48.3 ng/ml/h by 90 min (p less than 0.01). AII completely blocked the rise in PRA induced by captopril, whether given before or after captopril. Inactive renin did not decline as active renin increased over the 90-min study. Therefore, the PRA rise induced by captopril is mediated through a fall in AII levels and loss of feedback on renin-secreting cells. The rise in PRA comes from secretion of active renin rather than conversion from inactive renin.", 
    "47": "We have previously demonstrated that, after the release of 24-h unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and renal blood flow (RBF) are reduced because of increased production of the potent vasoconstrictors thromboxane A2 (TxA2) and angiotensin II (ANG II). Captopril, which blocks ANG II production, increases GFR and RBF. Sequential administration of aprotinin, a kallikrein inhibitor, has an additive effect to further decrease renal vasoconstriction, even though kinins are generally thought to be vasodilators. Therefore, we assessed mechanisms by which aprotinin might improve renal function of previously obstructed anesthetized rats. When given alone to UUO rats, aprotinin improved renal hemodynamics. Since kinins stimulate TxA2 production by UUO kidneys perfused in vitro, our data suggest that aprotinin improved postobstructive function by decreasing kinin-stimulated TxA2 production, although this may not be its only effect. Aprotinin also improved postobstructive function, even if TxA2 formation was blocked with indomethacin. But when both ANG II and TxA2 formation were blocked by the simultaneous administration of captopril and indomethacin, aprotinin had no effect. This suggests that aprotinin may also affect ANG II formation. These pharmacological effects of aprotinin suggest that the kallikrein-kinin system may also contribute to postobstructive renal vasoconstriction by stimulating the production of both vasoconstrictor eicosanoids and ANG II.", 
    "48": "The effects of various peptidase inhibitors were examined upon the K+-evoked overflow of substance-like immunoreactive material (SPLI) from slices of rat substantia nigra in order to assess the possible involvement of \"enkephalinase,\" angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and calpain in the enzymatic inactivation of endogenous substance P in brain tissues. The calpain inhibitor leupeptin and the enkephalinase inhibitors thiorphan and phosphoramidon increased markedly SPLI overflow, whereas the two ACE inhibitors, captopril and enalaprilat (up to 10 microM in the superfusing medium), were inactive. Surprisingly kelatorphan, which inhibits not only enkephalinase but also aminopeptidase and dipeptidylaminopeptidase activities, was less potent than thiorphan or phosphoramidon to enhance SPLI overflow. However, in the presence of ICI-154129 or naloxone to block opiate receptors, kelatorphan was as potent as thiorphan, therefore suggesting some negative influence of endogenous opioids on SPLI release with kelatorphan but not thiorphan. In agreement with this interpretation, the direct stimulation of delta opiate receptors by deltakephalin was found to significantly reduce SPLI overflow. Furthermore, an increased outflow of [Met]enkephalin-like material was observed from substantia nigra slices superfused with kelatorphan but not thiorphan. These results indicate that endogenous substance P released within the substantia nigra is very probably inactivated by enkephalinase and calpain, but not ACE. They also demonstrate that endogenous opioids can exert a negative control upon substance P release in this brain region.", 
    "49": "Sleep disturbances are frequently associated with the use of antihypertensive drugs. They are observed mainly during the administration of drugs that affect central adrenergic mechanisms. Beta-adrenoceptor antagonists which readily penetrate into the brain (propranolol, pindolol) increase wakefulness and/or decrease REM sleep. Alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists (clonidine, guanfacine) markedly reduce the duration of REM sleep. The catecholamine depleting agent reserpine increases REM sleep during single or repeated-dose administration, while the MAOI phenelzine shows opposite effects. The 5-HT2 antagonist ritanserin, which is chemically related to the antihypertensive agent ketanserin, increases slow wave sleep while REM sleep is decreased. Sleep disturbances have not been reported during the administration of calcium entry antagonists. However, they seem to modify the effects of hypnotics and CNS stimulants. There are no formal studies on the effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and vasodilators on sleep in man.", 
    "50": "Converting enzyme inhibitors prevent the development of hypertension and normalize arterial blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), suggesting a critical role for angiotensin II in genetic hypertension. We hypothesized that the SHR is hyperresponsive to the slow-pressor effect of angiotensin II. To test this hypothesis, 14 SHR and 14 normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY) were treated chronically with captopril (100 mg X kg-1 X day-1 in drinking water) beginning at 5 weeks of age. At 9 weeks of age, either angiotensin II (125 ng/min; 7 SHR and 7 WKY) or vehicle (7 SHR and 7 WKY) was infused for 2 weeks via an osmotic minipump implanted into the peritoneal cavity. Captopril treatment was maintained and systolic blood pressure was monitored 3 times weekly. Although systolic blood pressure was similar in SHR and WKY infused with vehicle (101 +/- 2 versus 103 +/- 5 mmHg, respectively during the second week), systolic blood pressure in SHR treated with angiotensin II was much greater than systolic blood pressure in WKY treated with angiotensin II (193 +/- 9 versus 132 +/- 11 mmHg, respectively during the second week, p less than 0.001). These results indicate that compared to WKY, SHR are remarkably more sensitive to the slow-pressor effect of chronic, low-dose infusions of angiotensin II. Our results support the hypothesis that the critical genetic defect in SHR is a change in the sensitivity to the slow-pressor effect of angiotensin II.", 
    "51": "The introduction in the treatment of arterial hypertension of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium inhibitors, as well as the results of extensive multicentric therapeutic trials, suggest that the prescription of antihypertensive drugs will be profoundly altered in the forthcoming years. The \"step by step\" approach will be abandoned, and each patient will receive one or two drugs chosen for being the most selective and most suitable for his case. These more personalized long-term treatments will be better tolerated, and the greater patient's compliance will make them more effective drugs to the underlying pathology (smoking habits, blood lipid disorders, early arterial lesions) the antihypertensive treatment will have a greater reducing effect on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.", 
    "52": "1. To investigate the interaction of angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and calcium antagonist, we conducted a double-blind randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study of a new ACE inhibitor (CGS 14824 A, 20 mg) during intravenous administration (i.v.) of nicardipine in eight normotensive healthy subjects. Nicardipine was infused to give cumulative doses of 1.25, 3.75, and 8.75 mg after 10, 20 and 30 min. 2. ACE inhibition was demonstrated 24 h after the first CGS 14 824 A intake (61%). Three hours after the second dose this inhibition was more marked (98%). 3. I.v. nicardipine administration induced a significant and similar fall in systolic or diastolic blood pressure with and without ACE activity (-3/-6 vs -2/-8%), while tachycardia was significantly decreased by CGS 14 824 A (+14 vs +30%, P less than 0.02). The increase of plasma noradrenaline was also significantly blunted (+1.8 +/- 0.3 vs +3.1 +/- 0.7 pmol ml-1, P less than 0.05). 4. Active and total plasma renin increased at the end of nicardipine infusion in the presence or absence of ACE inhibition. Inactive renin did not increase after nicardipine infusion under placebo. It was higher 3 h after the second intake of CGS 14 824 A and then increased after nicardipine infusion. 5. The rise in plasma aldosterone during i.v. calcium antagonist infusion was diminished after ACE inhibition (126 +/- 39 vs 277 +/- 120 pmol l-1, P less than 0.02). 6. In conclusion, converting-enzyme inhibition buffers the rise in heart rate, plasma noradrenaline and plasma aldosterone induced by acute calcium blockade.",

Pseudo-first-order kinetics were observed throughout the pH range studied and the log(rate)-pH profiles reflected four kinetic processes (ko, k'o, k'o, and kOH) as well as the two pKa's of 1. Excellent (greater than 98%) mass balance was obtained through products 2-5. At pH 4 or below, intramolecular cyclization leading to diketopiperazine 5 accounted for greater than 93% of the observed neutral- or water-catalyzed processes (ko and k'o). At pH levels greater than 5, hydrolysis giving 2 predominated and was responsible for the observed neutral- or water-catalyzed (k''o) and specific base-catalyzed (kOH) kinetic processes. Some epimerization leading to the S,S,R drug isomer (4) was also observed at pH levels greater than 7. The relative acidity of the protons at the three chiral centers of 1 was qualitatively compared and was used to explain the observed specificity in epimerization.", 
    "54": "Pharmacological intervention in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) by inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is an effective therapy for the majority of hypertensive patients and a major advance in the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure. The success achieved with ACE inhibitors has increased interest in inhibitors of renin. Renin catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step of the RAS and, unlike ACE, has a high specificity for its endogenous protein substrate. A therapeutic agent that inhibits this specific reaction could have advantages over antihypertensive drugs with less specific modes of action. Although inhibitors of renin have been studied for over two decades, only recently has substantial progress been made toward potent, low molecular weight inhibitors likely to become useful therapeutic agents. Recent advances in the development of renin inhibitors, especially progress toward clinically useful inhibitors, is reviewed.", 
    "55": "The clinical features, autoantibody changes, acetylator and HLA-DR phenotype of 20 patients with hydralazine-induced systemic lupus erythematosus are described. Four cases of particular interest are discussed in greater detail. Hydralazine sensitivity is more common in women, slow acetylators and the HLA-DR4 phenotype. Symptoms can occur even after many years of treatment and clinical awareness must be maintained for all patients to detect sensitivity at an early stage; there is no timely safe dose even in rapid acetylators. Joint symptoms predominate and full resolution is usual on discontinuing hydralazine. Failure of resolution should raise the suspicion of an underlying cause for the arthritis.", 
    "56": "We evaluated the effects of captopril and nifedipine on normoxic and hypoxic pulmonary vascular tone in unanesthetized sheep. Infusion of captopril (10 micrograms/kg/min) in normoxia revealed a tendency to increase the mean pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa) and the pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) following the systemic vasodilation. A statistically significant increase was reached by 20 minutes. Hypoxia of 10% oxygen in nitrogen produced a prominent pulmonary hypertensive response. Captopril significantly decreased the hypoxic values of Ppa and PVR from 20.3 +/- 1.3 to 17.1 +/- 1.1 mmHg (p less than 0.01) and from 4.31 +/- 0.45 to 3.49 +/- 0.45 mmHg/L/min (p less than 0.01), respectively. Infusion of nifedipine (10 micrograms/kg/min) in normoxia caused an increase in Ppa from 15.5 +/- 0.9 to 18.9 +/- 1.0 mmHg (p less than 0.01), but not in PVR. This elevation in Ppa was considered to be derived from the significant increase in the cardiac output. Nifedipine significantly decreased the hypoxic values of Ppa and PVR from 21.3 +/- 1.5 to 19.3 +/- 1.5 mmHg (p less than 0.05) and from 3.88 +/- 0.30 to 27.3 +/- 0.13 mmHg/L/min (p less than 0.01), respectively. Captopril and nifedipine produced systemic hypotensive responses during both normoxic and hypoxic ventilation. It is concluded that both captopril and nifedipine are potent pulmonary vasodilating drugs in animal subjects with a hypoxic condition and that they might be useful in the clinical vasodilator therapy of hypoxic pulmonary hypertension in man.", 
    "57": "In Study A, rats were implanted with a cannula aimed at either the lateral (LV) or ventral third (V3V) brain ventricles 1 week prior to starting a chronic oral regimen of captopril. The presence of neither cannula significantly impaired the emergence of captopril-induced appetite for NaCl solution. In Study B, V3V cannulae were implanted in rats after a captopril-induced appetite for NaCl was established. The surgery produced a 1-2 day attenuation of NaCl intake, but this was no greater than that observed in a sham-operated group that received no cannula. These results do not support those of others who suggest that captopril (and, by inference, other agents) can leak across a damaged blood-brain barrier for at least 2 weeks after placement of a cannula. Possible reasons for the differences in results are addressed.", 
    "58": "A 51-yr-old nonsmoking male patient without any history of previous allergies, asthma, hay fever, or urticaria developed attacks of asthma when captopril was added to the nadolol and dyazide treatment for his high blood pressure. A double-blind challenge with nadolol and captopril decreased FEV1 by 3 and 12%, respectively. This confirmed the history of captopril-related asthma. As angiotensin-converting enzyme seems to play a role in the genesis and metabolism of bronchomotor mediators, this rare form of drug-induced asthma is important for both clinicians and airways pharmacologists.", 
    "59": "Ten clinically stable, hypercapneic patients with advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were studied to assess the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme blockade on their inability to excrete a sodium load. Renal, hormonal, and cardiovascular responses to sodium loading were determined during two 5.5-h studies: control day, placebo; and experimental day, captopril. At baseline, compared with control subjects, patients displayed a decrease in urinary sodium associated with low effective renal plasma flow and high plasma level of aldosterone. Captopril, given before sodium loading, produced a significant increase in urinary sodium without increasing effective renal plasma flow and without suppressing plasma aldosterone more than sodium loading alone. Thus, the mechanism by which angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition induces an acute sodium diuresis in these patients remains to be elucidated. The blockade of angiotensin with captopril also affected the osmotic regulation of vasopressin: for a given increase in plasma osmolality, the increase in plasma vasopressin was subnormal, a finding consistent with the hypothesis that angiotensin II contributes to the regulation of vasopressin secretion.", 
    "60": "The effects of captopril, methyldopa, and propranolol were assessed for sense of well-being and vitality among 626 men with mild to moderate hypertension in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind clinical trial. After a 24-week treatment period, patients taking captopril, compared with patients taking methyldopa and propranolol, scored significantly higher on measures of well-being and vitality. In addition, patients on captopril had more favorable results in being able to keep up with their work and in not feeling tired or sleepy at work. The effects of each of the drugs manifested themselves at different periods. For example, the negative effects of methyldopa on vitality were evident by week 8, whereas the negative effects did not become manifest for propranolol until week 24. On the other hand, a steady progressive improvement in vitality scores was evident at week 8 and at week 24 for patients on captopril. The findings of the study also suggest that the effects of the treatment drugs were most marked in patients who had had previous antihypertensive medications and who were on single-drug therapy during the course of the clinical trial. Further, the differences between patients taking captopril and those on methyldopa and propranolol appear to be obscured by the addition of a diuretic. The findings of the study may guide the physician in orienting his or her patient and in planning and implementing a therapeutic regimen.", 
    "61": "Maximal oxygen uptake (VO2), skeletal muscle blood flow by xenon-133 washout technique and femoral vein arteriovenous oxygen difference and lactate were measured at rest and during maximal bicycle exercise in eight patients with severe congestive heart failure before and after 8 weeks of therapy with captopril. During therapy, skeletal muscle blood flow at rest increased significantly from 1.5 +/- 0.6 to 2.6 +/- 1.0 ml/100 g per min (p less than 0.05), with a concomitant decrease in the femoral arteriovenous oxygen difference from 10.0 +/- 1.7 to 8.3 +/- 1.9 ml/100 ml (p less than 0.05). Maximal VO2 increased significantly from 13.4 +/- 3.0 to 15.5 +/- 4.1 ml/kg per min (p less than 0.05). In four patients, the increase in maximal VO2 averaged 3.7 ml/kg per min (range 2.7 to 4.9), whereas in the remaining four patients, it was less than 1 ml/kg per min. Overall, peak skeletal muscle blood flow attained during exercise did not change significantly during long-term therapy with captopril (19.6 +/- 6.2 versus 27.6 +/- 14.3 ml/100 g per min, p = NS). However, the four patients with a significant increase in maximal VO2 experienced substantial increases in peak skeletal muscle blood flow and the latter changes were linearly correlated with changes in maximal VO2 (r = 0.95, p less than 0.001). Femoral arteriovenous oxygen difference at peak exercise was unchanged (12.6 +/- 2.6 versus 12.6 +/- 2.4 ml/100 ml). Thus, improvement in maximal VO2 produced by long-term therapy with captopril is associated with an increased peripheral vasodilatory response to exercise, and this improvement only occurs when the peak blood flow is augmented.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "62": "We assessed the role of angiotensin II in mediating the alterations in renal hemodynamics known to result from low protein feeding to normal rats by examining the effect of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril. 2 wk of low protein (6% casein) diet resulted in decreased glomerular filtration rate (normal protein [NP], 1.82 +/- 0.17 vs. low protein [LP], 0.76 +/- 0.01 ml/min; P less than 0.05) and renal plasma flow (NP, 6.7 +/- 0.2 vs. LP, 3.3 +/- 0.3 ml/min; P less than 0.05); renal vascular resistance rose (NP, 8.7 +/- 0.4 vs. LP, 19.8 +/- 1.4 dyn . s per cm5; P less than 0.05). These changes were accompanied by a significant decrease in plasma renin activity (NP, 7.0 +/- 0.7 vs. LP, 4.4 +/- 0.8 ng A I/ml per h; P less than 0.05), plasma aldosterone concentration (NP, 7.0 +/- 0.6 vs. LP, 4.1 +/- 0.7 ng/dl; P less than 0.05), and urinary PGE2 excretion (NP, 3,120 +/- 511 vs. LP, 648 +/- 95 pg/mgCr; P less than 0.05); by contrast renal renin content was significantly increased (NP, 2,587 +/- 273 vs. LP, 7,032 +/- 654 ng A I/mg protein; P less than 0.05). Treatment with captopril (30 mg/kg per d) raised glomerular filtration rate (GFR; LP + capt, 1.6 +/- 0.2 ml/min) and renal plasma flow (RPF; LP + capt, 6.7 +/- 0.7 ml/min), and reduced renal vascular resistance (LP + capt, 9.2 +/- 0.5 dyn/s per cm5) in low protein-fed animals. These values were not different from those measured in untreated and captopril-treated rats fed a normal (23%) protein diet. There were no changes in systemic mean arterial pressure in any group of rats. These data provide evidence that intrarenal angiotensin II mediates the changes in intrarenal hemodynamics induced by protein deprivation. The effects of low protein feeding may be partly potentiated by the reduction in PGE2 synthesis. However, the normalization of GFR and RPF in view of only modest increases in PGE2 excretion after captopril (LP, 648 +/- 95 vs. LP + capt, 1,131 +/- 82 pg/mgCr; P less than 0.05) suggests that if PGE2 is involved in these changes, it plays a permissive but not essential role in the increased renovascular resistance.", 
    "63": "The role of cations in vascular angiotensin receptor regulation has been investigated by radioligand receptor assay using a cell membrane fraction derived from mesenteric arterial muscle of the rat. In arterial membrane fractions from normal rats, the apparent receptor density varied with the ambient [Ca++] over the range, 0-10 mM. Receptor densities of 50 +/- 4, 102 +/- 4, and 156 +/- 5 fmol/mg membrane protein were obtained in low (0 mM), normal (4.8 mM), and high (25 mM) [Ca++], respectively. After 2 days of sodium loading, sodium depletion, and converting enzyme blockade altered receptor densities were detected in normal assay but not in high [Ca++] or low [Ca++], indicating changes in the relationship between [Ca++] and apparent receptor density. Similar results were obtained after 12 days of sodium loading or converting enzyme blockade. After 12 days of sodium depletion, there was no difference in receptor density between normal and high [Ca++] (44 +/- 5 fmol/mg protein) and the value obtained in low [Ca++] (27 +/- 2 fmol/mg protein) was significantly below that for all other groups. No change in receptor affinity was observed. These results suggest that there are two stages in vascular angiotensin receptor regulation; an initial masking-unmasking process which involves Ca++, and with prolonged agonist occupancy, an actual loss of receptors.", 
    "64": "Bradykinin infusion has been shown to improve glucose metabolism in non-insulin-dependent diabetic subjects (NIDD). Therefore, we tested the following hypothesis: inhibition of Kininase II, the bradykinin (BK) degrading enzyme, by captopril may also improve glucose metabolism in NIDD. Immediate effects of captopril on total body and peripheral glucose disposal were examined in five normotensive, normal weight NIDD and compared with five NIDD control subjects, well matched for age, weight and degree of fasting hyperglycaemia. The euglycaemic insulin clamp technique was employed in combination with the forearm catheter technique. After 90 min of insulin infusion a single dose of 25 mg captopril was administered orally, whereas in the control group a placebo was given. Captopril lead to a significant rise in total body glucose disposal and forearm glucose uptake, while in the control group no change was observed. Simultaneously, captopril lead to reduction in muscular release of lactate and pyruvate. We conclude that these results demonstrate the stimulatory effect of captopril on insulin-induced glucose disposal of the whole body, which appears to be a result of increased glucose utilization by peripheral tissues. Because of the described insulin-like activity of bradykinin, the concomitant accumulation of local kinins by captopril-induced inhibition of kininase II may represent an attractive hypothesis to explain the generated data sufficiently.", 
    "65": "To define the role of vasopressin as a vasoconstrictor hormone in sodium depletion, systemic hemodynamics and regional blood flow distribution were examined in conscious Sprague-Dawley rats after 6 days of a low-sodium diet. Studies were performed after selective or combined blockade with the vasopressin antagonist [d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)]AVP (AVPA), enalaprilat (CEI), and phentolamine (PHENTOL). Plasma levels of vasopressin were increased significantly after CEI and increased further after PHENTOL and CEI plus PHENTOL. AVPA had no effect on blood pressure, whether given alone or in the presence of PHENTOL, CEI, or CEI plus PHENTOL. Significant falls in peripheral vascular resistance associated with reflex increases in cardiac output were observed when AVPA was given to animals pretreated with either CEI or PHENTOL but not both. AVPA alone produced no significant changes in regional blood flow distribution, but a vasoconstrictor action of vasopressin in the renal vascular bed was revealed after prior treatment with CEI or PHENTOL. Muscle blood flow was also increased in the PHENTOL plus AVPA group compared with the PHENTOL group. No significant additional effects of AVPA were revealed by pretreatment with CEI, PHENTOL, or CEI plus PHENTOL for mesenteric, hepatic, splenic, or cerebral vascular beds. It is suggested that vasopressin acts as a vasoconstrictor hormone in conscious sodium-depleted rats when either the renin-angiotensin system or alpha-adrenergic system is inhibited but not when both systems are blocked. The renal vascular bed is an important site for vasopressin-induced vasoconstriction under these circumstances.", 
    "66": "In order to elucidate the mechanism of suppression of plasma aldosterone by chronic ACTH administration, especially the role of the renin-angiotensin system and dopamine, we administered ACTH with or without MK422, a converting enzyme inhibitor, to reduce the endogenous angiotensin II in rats, and measured the plasma renin activity, plasma corticoid concentrations and urinary dopamine excretion. The plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) was decreased after chronic ACTH administration. However, in the ACTH + MK422 administered group, aldosterone suppression was not observed. It appeared therefore that the aldosterone suppressing mechanism was independent of the weakened renin-angiotensin system following chronic ACTH administration, since PAC was not decreased in the ACTH + MK422 administered group when angiotensin II might be completely eliminated. The urinary excretion of dopamine was significantly increased in the chronic ACTH + MK422 administered group as well as in the chronic ACTH administered group. This suggested that the inhibitory effect of dopamine on aldosterone did not contribute significantly to the suppression of plasma aldosterone. The present results suggest therefore that the mechanism of suppression of plasma aldosterone following chronic ACTH administration was not dependent on the renin-angiotensin system and dopamine.", 
    "67": "The relative contributions of three kininases to total urinary kininase activity were determined by measuring the hydrolysis of kinins in the presence and absence of inhibitors of kininase I (2-mercaptomethyl-3-guanidinoethylthiopropanoic acid; MGTA), kininase II (captopril) and neutral endopeptidase 24.11 (NEP or enkephalinase A; phosphoramidon). Surprisingly, NEP was responsible for 68 +/- 2% (N = 18) of the total kininase in the rat while kininase I and II contributed only 9 +/- 0.4% and 23 +/- 1%, respectively. To study the effects of NEP inhibition on renal function, phosphoramidon (110 or 330 micrograms/hr/kg; N = 6) or saline (0.1 microliter/min; N = 6) was infused into rats. Urinary kinins, kininases, renal blood flow (RBF), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), UNaV, UKV and UV were measured during control, experimental and recovery periods. Phosphoramidon at the higher dose decreased total urinary kininase activity from 284 +/- 49 to 58 +/- 5 ng/min/kg (77%, P less than 0.01), and increased kinin excretion from 74 +/- 9 to 128 +/- 21 pg/min/kg (73%, P less than 0.02), UV from 72 +/- 10 to 82 +/- 10 microliters/min/kg (15%, P less than 0.01) and UNaV from 12 +/- 2 to 17 +/- 3 microEq/min/kg (37%, P less than 0.02), while BP, RBF, GFR and UKV did not change. 125I-Tyr0-bradykinin infused into the aorta did not appear in the urine intact during simultaneous phosphoramidon and captopril administration. This is the first demonstration of NEP having a major role in the catabolism of kinins. The increase in UNaV and UV after phosphoramidon administration may be due to the inhibition of intrarenal kinin destruction.", 
    "68": "We have verified the analytical reliability of a Sigma reagent kit, which is a modified method of Holmquist et al. (1) for the determination of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) on the Abbott ABA-100 analyzer. The reaction was linear up to 160 U/L. Correlation with a radiometric method (Ventrex Laboratories) was good except for a negative constant bias and loss of linearity with the radiometric method at high levels. The reconstituted reagent was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy to contain 5.6 mumol/L of zinc. An increase in zinc content up to 45.6 mumol/L had little or no effect on enzyme activities of preparations from three mammalian species: rabbit, guinea pig and human. Neither was ACE activity inhibited by preincubating each of two serum pools with any of four corticosteroids for up to 8 d. Enzyme activity in samples remained stable at 5 degrees C for 8 d.", 
    "69": "Enalapril was shown to have no effect on the serum potassium of patients (n = 16) already taking Frusemide and Amiloride. Furthermore, there was no difference in serum potassium levels of the group taking a combination of Enalapril, Frusemide and Amiloride when compared to a similar group of patients taking Frusemide and Amiloride alone (n = 19). No patients in either group were deemed to have seriously impaired renal function. The results indicate that the theoretical hyperkalaemic effect of concurrent administration of Enalapril and Amiloride is not manifest in clinical practice in patients with normal renal function.", 
    "70": "The consequences of morphologic changes in the kidney distal to a stenosis induced by chronic administration of a converting enzyme inhibitor were determined after induction of experimental renovascular hypertension in rats. The relationship between changes in morphology in the clipped kidney and diuresis, creatinine, and mortality was studied by converting a two-kidney, one-clip model into a one-kidney, one-clip model after 1 month of converting enzyme inhibition. The right renal artery was constricted with a clip of 0.2 mm diameter to increase blood pressure, the left kidney was left untouched. After 1 month, systolic blood pressure had increased to 173 +/- 27 mm Hg in the clipped animals (n = 47) compared with 139 +/- 8 mm Hg in sham-operated animals (n = 15; group 1). An inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme, MK421 (2 mg/kg, po), or an equivalent volume of vehicle was then administered daily for 1 month. After treatment with the converting enzyme inhibitor, blood pressure (148 +/- 28 mm Hg) was virtually identical with that of a sham-operated, vehicle-treated control group (145 +/- 16 mm Hg, n = 15), and was significantly lower than that of untreated hypertensive rats (186 +/- 30 mm Hg, n = 17) (group 2). The weight of the left kidney was increased in the untreated hypertensive animals as compared with sham-operated controls (1260 +/- 168 mg for group 2 versus 1075 +/- 100 mg for group 1). After treatment with MK421, the weight of the contralateral kidney (1472 +/- 190 mg) was further increased. After 1 month of treatment with MK421 or vehicle, the unclipped left kidney was removed from all animals. The treated animals were then randomly divided into two groups: one in which treatment with MK421 was stopped (treated/untreated, n = 24; group 3) and a second in which the treatment was continued (treated/treated, n = 23; group 4). The ability of the rats to excrete a water load of 15 ml was then examined 12 hours after removal of the unclipped left kidney. In the two groups of treated rats, the urinary excretion of the water load was decreased and frequency of oliguria was increased as compared with controls and hypertensive untreated rats. Survival rates were affected by the treatment: 3 deaths occurred in the hypertensive untreated group 2, 10 in the treated/untreated group 3, and 12 in the treated/treated group 4. The majority of these deaths could be attributed to renal insufficiency.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "71": "The previous finding that converting enzyme inhibitors (CEIs) potentiate bradykinin (BK), but do not inhibit conversion of angiotensin (ANG) I in isolated vessels, was explored further in the rat perfused mesenteric vascular bed. To investigate whether other peptidases besides angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) might be involved in CEI-resistant ANG I conversion, synthetic angiotensinogen fragments (1-14, 1-11 and 2-14) were studied. Their vasoconstrictor activities were found to be about 80 times less than that of ANG I, and were not altered by the CEI enalaprilat, indicating that tonin-like enzymes do not play a role in the generation of ANG II by the arterial wall. The hypothesis that BK potentiation by CEI in arteries might be due to a direct effect on the receptors was not supported by the lack of potentiation, by enalaprilat, of the vasorelaxant effect of Lys-Lys-BK (an ACE-resistant BK homologue). Finally, the effect of pH in the perfusing solution on ACE inhibition by enalaprilat was studied. Whereas converting activity decreased with increasing pH in the range 6.8 to 8.1, enalaprilat did not affect the responses to ANG I at pH 7.5 or 7.8, but blocked them at pH 7.1. Our results indicate that arterial ACE shows substrate-specific inhibition and that, at physiological pH, converting activity is resistant to inhibition by CEIs, whose hypotensive action would be due mainly to inhibition of arterial wall kininase activity.", 
    "72": "Dispersed, superfused goldfish anterior pituitary cell columns were stimulated with pulses of salmon angiotensin I (sAI), human angiotensin I (hAI), and human angiotensin II (hAII). Human AII stimulated the greatest release of ACTH. The dose-response curves for hAI and sAI were similar and revealed that hAI and sAI were about one-tenth as potent as hAII in stimulating ACTH release. In mammals, AI must be converted to AII in order to stimulate ACTH release. In goldfish, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril, which inhibits the conversion of AI to AII, was not able to block sAI-stimulated ACTH release. This finding suggests that the angiotensin receptor of the goldfish corticotrope is less discriminating than that of the mammalian corticotrope and recognizes both AI and AII. This hypothesis was supported by the observation that sarcosine analogs of AII, which block AII-stimulated ACTH release in mammals, failed to block hAII-stimulated ACTH release in goldfish. Saralasin showed negligible, [Sar1,Thr8]-AII slight, and [Sar1, Ile8]-AII moderate, intrinsic ACTH-releasing activity. These findings suggest that the ACTH-releasing activity of angiotensin appeared early in the evolution of the vertebrate pituitary.", 
    "73": "Both dietary protein restriction and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (CEI) reduce proteinuria in experimental renal disease. To determine whether the effects of dietary protein on albuminuria (UalbV) in nephrotic rats are modified by CEI, we measured UalbV and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in rats with passive Heymann nephritis fed 40 (HP) or 8.5% (LP) protein diets. Half of each group received enalapril beginning 2 days after injection of antibody. Enalapril prevented the greater UalbV and fractional clearance of albumin (FCalb) observed in HP (HP + enalapril, 136 +/- 44 mg/day and 0.88 +/- 0.54 X 10(-2), vs. HP, 368 +/- 60 mg/day and 4.40 +/- 2.90 X 10(-2), P less than 0.05 and P less than 0.05, respectively) but did not alter GFR significantly. Enalapril did not alter UalbV or FCalb in LP. To determine if CEI would reduce UalbV in rats after proteinuria was already present, rats fed 21% protein were studied 1 wk after the onset of proteinuria. Enalapril decreased UalbV (423 +/- 35 to 169 +/- 18 mg/day, P less than 0.001) and FCalb (3.19 +/- 0.36 X 10(-2) to 0.71 +/- 0.11 X 10(-2), P less than 0.001) after 3 days. Thus CEI reduced albuminuria in nephrotic rats fed high- or normal-protein diets without modifying GFR or serum albumin. This effect may be due to changes in glomerular hemodynamics or permselectivity.", 
    "74": "The major complication of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for the treatment of neonatal respiratory failure is bleeding related to heparinization. Systolic hypertension has emerged as another serious side effect in our experience. Thirty-eight of the first 41 newborns we treated with ECMO developed a systolic blood pressure greater than 90 mm Hg. The mean hypertension index (HI blood = hours greater than 90/hr on ECMO) was 0.17 +/- 0.16. Possible biochemical mediators were assayed in 17 patients. Plasma renin activity (PRA), aldosterone, epinephrine, norepinephrine, prostaglandin E2, thromboxane, and antidiuretic hormone were elevated. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and prostacyclin were not elevated. Eighteen patients (44%) had intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), and 11 patients (27%) had clinically significant ICH. The HI was significantly (p less than 0.005) lower in those patients without ICH (0.11 +/- 0.01) than in those patients with ICH (0.25 +/- 0.04). PRA at hour 12, day 2, and day 3 was significantly higher (p less than 0.05) in patients experiencing ICH (62 +/- 42; 93 +/- 15; 73 +/- 30 ng/ml/hr) than in those without ICH (27 +/- 25; 14 +/- 8; 12 +/- 4 ng/ml/hr). An aggressive approach to medical management evolved that included hydralazine, nitroglycerine, and captopril, which protected against ICH. Two of 23 patients (9%) treated with the protocol sufferred clinically significant ICH, whereas nine of 18 patients (50%) treated before implementation of the protocol experienced ICH. The ACE inhibitor captopril was most effective in the control of hypertension. We conclude that systolic hypertension is common during neonatal ECMO, is associated with ICH, and is related to a high PRA. Aggressive management of hypertension during ECMO can reduce the incidence of ICH, and captopril is an important component of this aggressive medical management.", 
    "75": "To identify patients with severe chronic heart failure who are at greatest risk of developing functional renal insufficiency during converting enzyme inhibition, creatinine clearance was measured in 59 patients before and after long-term therapy with captopril (39 patients) or enalapril (20 patients), while digitalis and diuretic therapy was kept constant. Creatinine clearance increased or remained constant in 33 of the 59 patients (Group I), but declined in the remaining 26 patients (Group II). The two groups were similar with respect to the cause of heart failure, pretreatment renal function and all pretreatment hemodynamic variables. Patients in Group II, however, had lower values for serum sodium concentration (134.8 +/- 1.0 versus 137.0 +/- 0.6 mmol/liter) and higher values for plasma renin activity (10.6 +/- 3.4 versus 3.0 +/- 0.5 ng/ml per hour), received larger doses of furosemide (108 +/- 11 versus 84 +/- 6 mg/day), were more frequently diabetic (42 versus 15%) and were more frequently treated with enalapril (50 versus 21%) than were patients in Group I (all p less than 0.05). By stepwise logistic analysis, only hyponatremia (or an elevated plasma renin activity) and enalapril therapy independently predicted the decline in creatinine clearance during converting enzyme inhibition. These observations could not be explained by changes in systemic blood pressure. In patients with a normal serum sodium concentration (greater than or equal to 137 mmol/liter), creatinine clearance increased with captopril (+21%, p less than 0.05), but not with enalapril (-6%, p = NS).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

In this study a rapid kinetic assay for estimation of plasma ACE is described and assessed. In particular the effects of zinc ion have been studied. In contrast to previous reports, a marked potentiation of ACE activity by micromolar concentrations of zinc was noted. The relationship between plasma zinc concentration and ACE activity in vivo was also investigated and related to albumin concentration. The findings may have implications for interpretation of plasma ACE activity in patients with low plasma zinc levels.",

Although 10 patients remained stable on captopril alone, 4 patients deteriorated, with the development of pulmonary oedema of breathlessness. All 4 patients had had pulmonary oedema previously, unlike the patients who remained stable. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition alone is not sufficient treatment for patients with mild heart failure and a history of overt pulmonary oedema.", 
    "78": "Electrolytic lesions of the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) caused significant increases in basal plasma renin activity (+433%) and basal plasma norepinephrine concentration (+98%) in conscious rats. Plasma epinephrine concentration, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, hematocrit, plasma osmolality and plasma sodium and potassium concentrations were not significantly affected by the lesions. Atenolol reduced the elevated plasma renin activity in the lesion group to a value similar to that of a control group (sham lesions or lesions in areas adjacent to the PBN). Captopril significantly lowered mean arterial pressure in the lesion group, but it had no effect on arterial pressure in the control group. Lesions of the PBN also increased the baroreflex-mediated bradycardia evoked by an abrupt elevation of arterial pressure. We propose that the PBN tonically inhibits sympathetic activity, sympathetically mediated renin release and baroreflex sensitivity.", 
    "79": "In a six month placebo-controlled cross-over trial twenty patients with hypertension and peripheral arterial disease were randomised to captopril 25 mg twice daily, atenolol 100 mg once daily, labetalol 200 mg twice daily, or pindolol 10 mg twice daily for one month. Although all treatments were equally effective at lowering blood pressure, pain-free and maximum walking distances on a treadmill were decreased by atenolol, labetalol, and pindolol, but not by captopril. Post-exercise calf blood flow availability was impaired by atenolol, labetalol, and pindolol, but not by captopril. Despite ancillary characteristics of cardioselectivity, intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, or combination with alpha-blockade, beta-blockers seem to impair the lower limb circulation in such patients, whereas captopril seems to preserve it, possibly by maintaining the collateral blood supply.", 
    "80": "Most patients with high blood pressure (BP) can be managed by using one of 4 classes of compounds: a diuretic, beta blocker, converting enzyme inhibitor or calcium antagonist. It is becoming clear, however, that different patients respond to different drugs and that side effects also vary from 1 patient to another. In many patients in whom 1 drug is not sufficient to lower BP, the combination of a low dose of 2 drugs, particularly a diuretic combined with a beta blocker or a converting enzyme inhibitor, is an effective way of decreasing BP further. An understanding of the mechanisms whereby drugs lower BP and why they are additive with some drugs and not with others is clearly important in the more rational use of drugs. The finding that much lower doses of drugs can be used is also important; the combination of a low dose of 2 drugs may not only be more effective in lowering BP but also have less side effects than a higher dose of a single drug. In patients with more resistant hypertension that is not controlled by 1 or 2 drugs combined, the next logical step is to add a third drug. Before doing this, however, it is important to check that the patient is complying with treatment and to consider secondary causes. Ideally, such patients should be referred to someone with a special interest in high BP as they are more likely to have an underlying cause for their hypertension.", 
    "81": "Diuretics and beta blockers are the mainstay in treating mild and moderate systemic hypertension, but there is controversy as to which should be used first. Recent evidence of an increase in sudden death and a greater number of intolerable side effects in the diuretic-treated groups in the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial in the U.S. and the Medical Research Council Trial in Great Britain has prompted some to suggest beta blockers as first-line therapy. However, beta blockers also have side effects, such as decreased ventricular function in patients with mild heart failure, increased airways resistance in those with chronic obstructive lung disease, increased plasma lipids, in particular low density lipoprotein cholesterol, and increased problems in patients with peripheral vascular disease and those with diabetes requiring insulin treatment. Many new beta-blocking drugs with different pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties allow the physician to choose the best one for each patient. beta-blocking drugs with long durations of action, high levels of bioavailability, beta 1 selectivity and intrinsic sympathomimetic activity appear most suitable for therapy. Cardioselectivity is suggested for patients with obstructive lung disease and peripheral vascular disease, and diabetic patients who take insulin. Long durations of action permit infrequent administration and recently agents with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity have been shown to have less effects on plasma lipid levels. Acebutolol also reduces ventricular arrhythmias, and may therefore be used to reduce sudden death in patients with coronary artery disease. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of beta-blocking drugs can indicate the most appropriate choice for hypertensive patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "82": "The effects of enalapril maleate were studied in a group of 6 patients with arterial hypertension, hypertensive cardiopathy, multiple metabolic disorders and habitual snoring. Earlier treatment with antihypertensive drugs (diuretics, antiadrenergics, calcium antagonists) had been suspended when a marked deterioration was noted in metabolic parameters and plasmatic electrolytes as well as extremely disturbed sleep. The latter is probably attributable to increased respiratory obstruction during the night as a result of the increased hypertonia of the muscles of the upper air ways due to low blood potassium as well as the central and peripheral effects of the antiadrenergic drugs. After the wash-out period there was a marked improvement in laboratory parameters that continued after treatment with enalapril maleate. In particular, apart from a further slight fall in blood cholesterol and uricaemia there was a statistically significant drop in triglyceride levels. The improvement in the laboratory parameters made it possible to reduce the doses of the drugs being taken for the metabolic disorders. A distinct improvement was also noted in the sleep disturbances especially the excessive drowsiness during the day. There was also a statistically significant drop in arterial, systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressure without any significant change in heart beat. The results indicate that enalapril maleate should be the treatment of choice for those patients in whom high blood pressure is accompanied by alterations to the main metabolic parameters and habitual snoring.", 
    "83": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are widely used today for the management of hypertension and congestive heart failure. These agents inhibit angiotensin II synthesis. In some particular circumstances they may be responsible for deterioration of renal function, e.g. in hypertensive patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or with stenosis of the artery supplying a single kidney, or in patients with severe congestive heart failure or marked nephroangiosclerosis. In these patients renal perfusion pressure may become too low to maintain adequate glomerular filtration as there remains no angiotensin II to increase the tone of the efferent arteriole. In high risk patients it is therefore recommended that serum creatinine be checked after initiating therapy with an ACE inhibitor.", 
    "84": "In order to evaluate whether changes in the plasma concentration of aldosterone (PA) following the administration of captopril, an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme, will establish the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism we have used this test in 9 healthy subjects and in 22 patients with various forms of hypertension, including 5 patients with primary aldosteronism due to idiopathic adrenal hyperplasia (n = 4) or aldosterone-producing adenoma (n = 1). The response of PA to captopril (25 mg orally) was investigated on an outpatient basis, following a rest period of 120 minutes in the supine position. In healthy subjects PA decreased from a mean basal value of 11.5 +/- 5.9 ng/dl to less than 6.4 ng/dl (4.9 +/- 1.4 ng/dl [p less than 0.01]). Similarly, captopril induced a fall in PA concentration to less than 6.4 ng/dl in patients with essential hypertension, with renal artery stenosis or with an afunctional kidney. Post-captopril concentrations of plasma aldosterone were about twice the normal level in 3 of 4 patients with idiopathic adrenal hyperplasia and about four-fold raised above normal in the patient with an aldosterone-producing adenoma. In spite of a false-negative result in one patient with idiopathic adrenal hyperplasia, the administration of captopril appears to be of use in recognizing patients with primary aldosteronism on an outpatient basis.", 
    "85": "Renal kininogen was detected in human medullary tissue as well as human medullary tubule suspensions. After treatment with pig pancreatic kallikrein or human renal cortical homogenate liberated kinin was measured by bradykinin radioimmunoassay. In the absence of inhibitors kinins were degraded by kininases located in the same part of the kidney. Several known inhibitors of kininase I and II did not inhibit this activity. Endogenous medullary kininase was inhibited by preincubation of homogenates at 56 degrees C for one hour or by addition of 0.25 mmol/l HgCl2. Under these conditions endogenous medullary kinin release amounted to 9-26 nmol/g protein. The action of renal cortical kininogenase on kinin formation from papillary kininogen was completely inhibited by addition of 1 mumol/l aprotinin. Kininogen examined in renal tubule suspensions revealed an increase in amount per g protein compared to homogenates, confirming the tubular localization of renal kininogen.", 
    "86": "Evidence is presented which supports the hypothesis that the renin-angiotensin (r-a) system regulates alcohol intake. Documented findings suggest that an elevated level of r-a activity represents a satiety signal which stops alcohol intake. The fact that alcohol itself is known to stimulate r-a activity suggests that its intake may in some sense be self-regulating and that levels of r-a activity below those which signal satiety may even be rewarding. The role of the r-a system in hypertension is also considered. The ability of alcohol to elevate r-a activity may be seen as a contributing factor to alcohol-induced hypertension because angiotensin is a potent pressor agent. Furthermore, the notion that lower levels of angiotensin may be rewarding permits the hypothesis that essential hypertension may, in part, be the result of a self-induced increase in endogenous angiotensin. This would explain the otherwise puzzling utility of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in the treatment of essential hypertension.", 
    "87": "SQ 27,786 is a sulfhydryl-containing angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, which also possesses potent diuretic activity in dogs after intravenous administration. The absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination of 35S-labeled SQ 27,786 was studied in dogs to determine if the observed pharmacologic activities were intrinsic to this compound or the result of metabolism to separate ACE-inhibitory and diuretic moieties. The poor pharmacologic activity observed after oral administration was found to be due to poor absorption of the ACE-inhibitory-diuretic compound. The results of this study indicated that SQ 27,786 was excreted largely intact, either as the parent compound, the symmetrical disulfide of the parent compound, or as mixed disulfides of the parent compound with endogenous sulfhydryl compounds (e.g., SQ 27,786-L-cysteine) in a manner similar to captopril. It was concluded that the observed diuretic and ACE inhibitory activities were the result of intact SQ 27,786 and not of metabolites resulting from cleavage of the molecule to separate diuretic and ACE inhibitory moieties.", 
    "88": "In a double-blind randomised cross-over study atenolol 100 mg daily and matching placebo were given to 14 patients whose blood pressure (BP) was uncontrolled on a fixed dose of captopril and frusemide. Atenolol produced a further reduction in both supine (170/105 mmHg to 163/94 mmHg) and standing (171/114 mmHg to 160/96 mmHg) BP and a significant fall in pulse rate and plasma renin activity (PRA). This fall in BP showed a highly significant correlation with pre-treatment plasma renin levels. No adverse side effects were encountered during the study. Previous suggestions that beta-blockade had no additional hypotensive effect in patients receiving captopril were not substantiated. For patients whose BP was poorly controlled with captopril and a diuretic, a selective beta-blocker is suggested as a useful third line agent.", 
    "89": "Eighteen patients whose clinic blood pressure (BP) remained over 95 mmHg despite treatment with captopril 50 mg twice daily plus frusemide 40 mg twice daily were randomised in a crossover study to four weeks' treatment with once daily atenolol 100 mg, slow release propranolol 160 mg or placebo. The reduction in BP on atenolol was superior to that on both propranolol and placebo. The mean supine BP 24 hours post dosing were 177/110 mmHg (placebo), 173/109 mmHg (propranolol) and 164/100 mmHg (atenolol). The corresponding mean heart rates were 77 bpm (placebo), 63 bpm (propranolol) and 62 bpm (propranolol) and 62 bpm (atenolol). The difference in hypotensive efficacy between atenolol and propranolol is not readily explained but our study shows that atenolol has a clinically useful supplementary effect on BP. Refractory hypertension remains an important clinical problem and further studies are required to establish the optimum combination of drugs that should be used with captopril in order to achieve 'target' BP in patients with moderate to severe hypertension.", 
    "90": "1 Stimulation of the renal sympathetic nerves in pentobarbitone anaesthetized rats at low frequencies, which did not statistically change renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate, significantly reduced urine flow by 35%, absolute sodium excretion by 44% and fractional sodium excretion by 40%. 2 In rats fed a low sodium diet for 2 to 3 weeks, similar renal nerve stimulation caused no consistent changes in renal haemodynamics but decreased urine flow by 38%, absolute sodium excretion by 44% and fractional sodium excretion by 38%, which were identical responses to those obtained in sodium replete animals. In contrast, stimulation of the renal nerves in sodium depleted rats given a constant infusion of captopril at 500 micrograms/kg/h had no statistically significant effect on either water or sodium excretion. 3 Renal nerve stimulation in rats given saline to drink and DOCA for 2 to 3 weeks did not significantly change either renal haemodynamics or the output of water or sodium. However, in other animals maintained on a high salt intake but given a constant infusion of angiotensin II (20 ng/kg/min), renal nerve stimulation caused minimal changes in renal haemodynamics but significantly reduced urine flow by 41%, absolute sodium excretion by 54% and fractional sodium excretion by 49%. 4 These results show that the neurally-mediated tubular responses require the presence of a minimal circulating level of angiotensin II since, when its production is blocked, either acutely or chronically, the renal nerve-induced antinatriuresis and antidiuresis is inhibited but can be restored by the infusion of angiotensin II. These findings provide direct evidence that angiotensin II has an important potentiating action at the renal nerve junctions, most probably at the epithelial cells of the renal tubule.", 
    "91": "The possible role of vasodilatory prostanoids in the antihypertensive action of captopril was investigated in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Captopril (100 mg/kg/day for 5 days) decreased systolic blood pressure and increased water consumption, urine excretion and plasma renin activity (PRA). It also enhanced the urinary excretion of the prostacyclin metabolite 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, but did not change the excretion of PGE2. Indomethacin (3 mg/kg/day), given both alone and in combination with captopril, reduced markedly the urinary excretions of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and PGE2 but did not alter PRA, compared with corresponding groups without indomethacin. The suppression of prostanoid synthesis caused by indomethacin did not affect the antihypertensive effect of captopril or the basal blood pressure in SHR. Neither did indomethacin influence drinking or urine excretion in SHR not receiving captopril, but it reduced the dipsogenic and diuretic effects of captopril. The results suggest that captopril augments the production of vasodilatory prostacyclin. Yet prostanoids have no significant role in the antihypertensive mechanism of captopril in SHR.", 
    "92": "1 The methodology and interim results of a post marketing surveillance of captopril, the first orally active angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor are presented. 2 Utilising viewdata technology, details of hypertensive patients were entered directly into a mainframe computer. This allowed day to day monitoring of events; a facility not available with paper-based methods. 3 The design of the study allowed analysis of results including some details of efficacy, concomitant therapy, any disease symptoms and reasons for withdrawal. These factors could be categorised according to sex and age. 4 This preliminary report is based on the first 13,295 patients entered from July 1983 with follow-up until January 1985. The results of the study confirm the safety of captopril in the patients studied.", 
    "93": "Intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of bradykinin (BK) analogs containing the substitution DPhe7 produced extreme postural distortions within 2-4 min after injection, eventually causing rats to spin repeatedly around their longitudinal axis. This behavior, called barrel rotation, has been previously reported following ICV administration of several other neuropeptides. Episodes lasted 5-20 min; two deaths occurred at high doses, but no other long-term effects were observed. The quantal ED50 of the prototype compound B4162 (DArg0, Thi5,8 DPhe7BK), was 14.9 nmole; all seven other DPhe7 analogs tested elicited a positive response at 20 nmole. Among analogs not containing DPhe7, only BK elicited any activity (20% response rate), and only at 100 nmoles. Structure-activity considerations indicate that this behavior is not mediated by classical kinin receptors. The response rate to 20 nmole B4162 (81%) did not significantly change after pretreatment with ICV BK (100 nmoles), or IP atropine, haloperidol or phenytoin; whereas pretreatment with ICV captopril and muscimol and IP naloxone, diazepam and phenobarbital all significantly inhibited the response. A GABAergic mechanism may be involved in this peptide behavior.", 
    "94": "We have studied retrospectively 18 infants who have received captopril for treatment of severe heart failure due to left-to-right shunts with pulmonary hypertension. Captopril has been administered in doses of up to 3.5 mg/kg/day (mean 2.47 mg/kg/day). Maintenance treatment with digoxin and frusemide was continued but potassium-sparing diuretics were stopped in most patients. The mean period of assessment was 19 days before and 27 days after commencing captopril. The mean daily weight gain before captopril was -7 g and after its introduction was + 13 g (P less than 0.001). There were statistically significant (P less than 0.05) falls in mean heart rate and respiratory rate and rises in plasma sodium concentration and feeding score. Plasma urea concentration fell but this did not reach statistical significance. Two patients suffered hypotension after increments in captopril dosage and subsequently had a rise in plasma urea and creatinine values. This adverse reaction may be linked to the presence of hyponatraemia. This preliminary report shows captopril may be useful in the control of severe heart failure in infancy.", 
    "95": "1. Chronic two-kidney, one-clip hypertensive rats were infused with captopril for 5 days and the daily variability of blood pressure compared with that for both hypertensive rats infused with glucose and normotensive animals. 2. Blood pressure was measured continuously using a computer data collecting system. 3. Normotensive animals showed a stable level of arterial pressure throughout each 24 h period with troughs occurring when they slept during the daytime. 4. Hypertensive animals given glucose had an enhanced diurnal rhythm of blood pressure compared with normotensive rats, with peaks occurring during periods of activity at night as well as troughs when they slept during the day. 5. Hypertensive rats given captopril retained this enhanced pressure variability, in spite of the fact that blood pressure was significantly lower and angiotensin II was suppressed. 6. These results suggest that angiotensin II is not involved in the increased blood pressure variability of renal hypertension and that some other irreversible mechanism is responsible.", 
    "96": "We have described a patient with captopril-induced cholestatic jaundice. Captopril was confirmed as the causative agent, because jaundice occurred after administration of captopril and resolved quickly after administration was stopped.", 
    "97": "Renal scintigraphy with [99mTc]diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) and/or sodium-iodine-131-o-iodohippurate (HIP) was performed before and after an oral dose of captopril (50 mg) in 18 patients with renovascular hypertension (RVH) due to renal artery stenosis (RAS) and 18 controls. In every patient with RVH, captopril induced, enhanced or sustained abnormal findings on HIP scintigraphy depending on the degree of RAS. With DTPA scintigraphy, renal function decreased after captopril in ten kidneys with RVH-related RAS and adequate baseline renal function, but this phenomenon was not evident in 11 kidneys with RVH and poor renal function. Captopril did not influence HIP or DTPA studies of kidneys with patent renal arteries (patients after successful renal angioplasty, patients with essential hypertension, contralateral kidneys of patients with unilateral RVH) or ipsilateral kidneys with mild and subcritical (less than 60%) RAS in patients without hypertension and/or normal renal vein renin activity. When HIP and DTPA scintigraphy were compared in the same patients, HIP demonstrated greater sensitivity and specificity than DTPA, particularly in patients with poor renal function. HIP scintigraphy before and after a single dose of captopril may provide a rapid sensitive and minimally invasive test for screening patients with hypertension.", 
    "98": "Activation of renal or vascular prostaglandin mechanisms (or both) has been proposed to contribute to the antihypertensive action of captopril. In conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) studied in the established phase of hypertension, the blood pressure-lowering effect of captopril, 30 mg/kg/12 hr p.o. given for 7 days, was greatly enhanced by the addition of aspirin, 200 mg/kg/day s.c. Systolic blood pressure decreased from 185 +/- 6 and 182 +/- 4 to 135 +/- 3 mm Hg in rats treated, respectively, with captopril and aspirin or captopril alone, and was unaltered by either vehicle or aspirin alone. Water intake was inconsistently affected by captopril but was increased (p less than 0.01) by aspirin and was even higher after captopril-aspirin treatment (p less than 0.01). Urine volume was elevated in all 3 drug-treated groups, increasing threefold after captopril-aspirin treatment. Excretion of sodium and potassium was unchanged by any treatment regimen. In the vehicle group, prostaglandin F2 alpha excretion, measured by radioimmunoassay, ranged between 65 and 93 ng/8 hr and was twofold to fourfold higher than that of prostaglandin E2. Prostaglandin F2 alpha was unaffected during captopril treatment, whereas prostaglandin E2 excretion decreased to 12 +/- 2 ng/8 hr (p less than 0.01) by Day 7. Long-term aspirin treatment, either with or without captopril, did not cause sustained inhibition of renal prostaglandin excretion, although a transient effect occurred within the first four hours of administration. These results indicate 1) aspirin potentiates the blood pressure-lowering effect of captopril in SHR, an effect that is associated with a threefold increase in urine flow.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "99": "The role of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the Na appetite of Na-deplete sheep was investigated. Intravenous infusion of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, at 0.01 or 0.1 mg X kg-1 X h-1 did not cause any change in Na intake, although the higher dose caused a marked decrease in mean arterial blood pressure. Intravenous infusion of captopril at 1.0 mg X kg-1 X h-1 over 24 h decreased Na intake by 45-55% in the absence of any change in Na loss. The decrease in Na intake was restored to base-line level or above by concurrent intravenous infusion of angiotensin II (ANG II) at 3.8 or 24 micrograms/h over 24 h but not by intracerebroventricular (ICV) ANG II at 3.8 micrograms/h. In addition, ICV infusion of 0.7 M mannitol (1 ml/h over 3 h), which reduced cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain extracellular fluid [Na], still increased Na intake when combined with intravenous captopril. Water intake was not altered during intravenous captopril or ANG II alone but was increased during ICV ANG II or 0.7 M mannitol (with or without iv captopril). In conclusion, these results suggest that the RAS is involved in the Na appetite of the Na-deplete sheep. Furthermore, it would appear that the brain area involved is one without a blood-brain barrier but with a CSF-brain barrier, such as one of the circumventricular organs. Also, it would appear that the effect of lowered cerebral Na and the effect of activation of the renin-angiotensin system on Na appetite are independent.", 
    "100": "In summary, ACE inhibitors are effective in reducing blood pressure as initial therapy in some hypertensive patients and in combination with diuretics and other agents in virtually all hypertensives. ACE inhibitors are uniquely advantageous because of their favorable hemodynamic effects, the lack of adverse metabolic effects, and their ability to prevent or blunt undesirable effects of diuretic therapy. Their safety in large numbers of hypertensives has been consistently demonstrated. The minor nature of most side effects and the rarity of life-threatening side effects of ACE inhibitors is reassuring. Clinical experience has provided information about patients likely to be at high risk for side effects with ACE inhibitors enabling avoidance of the drugs, or the use of small doses and careful scrutiny in such individuals. The development of this new class of drugs permits safe and effective blood pressure control with potential enhancement of the sense of well being and quality of life to a degree never before encountered.", 
    "101": "Functional and/or structural measurements were performed in eight groups of Munich-Wistar rats after five-sixths nephrectomy. Groups 1 and 5 received no therapy. Groups 2 and 6 received daily doses of methylprednisolone (MP). Groups 3 and 7 received MP plus the angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI), benzazepril. Groups 4 and 8 received CEI alone. Groups 1 through 4 underwent micropuncture study 2 wk after renal ablation. Untreated group 1 rats exhibited systemic hypertension and elevation of the single nephron glomerular filtration rate due to glomerular capillary hyperperfusion and hypertension. Administration of MP in group 2 resulted in comparable systemic hypertension, with further elevation of the single nephron glomerular filtration rate due to even higher values for glomerular perfusion and hydraulic pressure. Concurrent treatment with CEI in groups 3 and 4 controlled systemic and glomerular hypertension despite equivalent renal ablation and, in group 3, comparable doses of MP. Groups 5 through 8 were followed for 12 wk. Untreated group 1 rats demonstrated continued systemic hypertension, progressive proteinuria, and eventual glomerular sclerosis. Addition of MP in group 6 dramatically accelerated the development of proteinuria and glomerular sclerosis, while CEI (groups 7 and 8) afforded striking protection against disease progression. Thus, potent vasodilator glucocorticoids may amplify hemodynamically mediated glomerular injury, whereas control of systemic and glomerular hypertension prevents this undesirable consequence of chronic steroid therapy.", 
    "102": "In vitro autoradiography with [3H]captopril was used to localize and quantitate angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in various tissues in two-kidney, one-clip (2K-1C) hypertension, one-kidney, one-clip (1K-1C) hypertension, desoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertension, and a normotensive control group. There were no significant differences in mean systolic blood pressure among the hypertensive groups. Plasma renin activity (PRA) was highest in the 2K-1C group (6.20 +/- 2.17 ng/ml per h), intermediate in the 1K-1C group (2.19 +/- 0.62 ng/ml per h) and control group (3.20 +/- 0.53 ng/ml per h), and lowest in the DOCA-salt group (0.07 +/- 0.06 ng/ml per h). In the lungs, aorta, mesenteric arteries, and adrenal medulla, ACE labeling was highest in the 2K-1C group, intermediate in the 1K-1C and control groups, and lowest in the DOCA-salt group. ACE levels in these tissues correlated positively with PRA. In the kidney, anterior pituitary, testis, and choroid plexus of the brain, ACE levels correlated negatively with PRA, with lowest ACE levels in the 2K-1C group and highest levels in the DOCA-salt group. In the epididymis, posterior pituitary, and other regions of the brain, ACE levels did not differ significantly among the groups.",

    "104": "Aside from the retrospective analysis of Clark and Troop (1), no large-scale controlled study has been designed specifically to assess the advantages and disadvantages of fixed-dose antihypertensive combinations. The use of fixed-dose antihypertensive combinations is no longer the anathema of the academician. The principal advantages of fixed-ratio combinations are simplicity of use, potentiation of blood-pressure-lowering efficacy, and potential counterbalancing of certain side effects. An additional advantage might be improvement in broad-based cost effectiveness, that is, a potential reduction in the need for frequent laboratory surveillance and in the frequency of office visits. The principal disadvantage is the relative inflexibility of dosage adjustment. Antihypertensive therapy should be initiated with a single drug preparation, with subsequent substitution of a combination product when appropriate. Tables 4 and 5 summarize, respectively, some of the important factors to consider and the theoretical requirements when contemplating the use of fixed-dose antihypertensive combinations. Diuretic/beta-blocker combinations are particularly attractive because of the enormous long-term experience with each component, their proven efficacy and additional salutary effects, their generally acceptable and sometimes offsetting side effects, and their potential for once-a-day dosing. It seems likely that CEI/diuretic and perhaps calcium-channel blocker/diuretic combinations also have great merit.",

    "106": "The greater sensitivity of echocardiography than electrocardiography has revealed left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) to occur in a significant minority of patients with systemic hypertension, with the exact prevalence dependent both on how a population is selected and on the sex. race, and possibly age composition of its members. LVH is more closely related to blood pressure recorded in the patient's natural setting during normal activity or exercise--whether measured by portable recorder or home manometer--than to blood pressure measured by the physician. A subgroup of patients with mild essential hypertension exhibit high cardiac output and evidence of supernormal myocardial contractility in the absence of LVH; whereas amongst patients with more sustained hypertension, LVH may be either concentric (associated with high ejection fractions) or eccentric (associated with abnormal responses to exercise). Recent data indicate that echocardiographic detection of LVH identifies mildly hypertensive patients at significant risk, a finding that may aid identification of patients for drug treatment.", 
    "107": "The protective effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) on myocardial ischemia and reperfusion damage was estimated in rat hearts, both in vivo and in vitro. Enalapril 2.5 mg/kg ip pretreatment at 24 and 5 h before coronary occlusion, significantly blunted the rise of CPK (445 +/- 151 vs 649 +/- 244 mu/ml, P less than 0.05) and improved electrocardiogram (ECG) 8 h after coronary occlusion. In global ischemia and reperfusion ex vivo, enalapril improved contractility (0.9 +/- 0.2 vs 0.3 +/- 0.3 g, P less than 0.05) and coronary flow (15.6 +/- 3.3 vs 11.9 +/- 3.1 ml/min/g, P less than 0.05), shortened significantly the duration of reperfusion arrhythmia (3.1 +/- 2.7 vs 9.7 +/- 8.1 min, P less than 0.05). In Langendorffs heart, captopril remarkably preserved force of contraction (2.1 +/- 0.4 vs 1.4 +/- 0.4 g, P less than 0.01) and coronary flow (2.7 +/- 0.5 vs 3.6 +/- 0.9 ml/min/g, P less than 0.05) in segmental infarction deteriorated by angiotensin I. Captopril 10(-5) M infusion reduced the release of CPK (435 +/- 112 vs 640 +/- 123 mu/min coronary flow, P less than 0.05). This action was almost completely abolished by pretreating and infusing with indomethacin. As a positive control, prostacyclin 5 X 10(-7) M infusion further reduced the release of CPK to 330 +/- 77 mu/min. It is concluded that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor can protect both myocardial ischemia and reperfusion damage in rat hearts. The mechanism of protection was ascribed to reduced production of angiotensin II by ACE inhibition and increased prostacyclin release in the myocardium.", 
    "108": "Although dissimilar in chemical structure and pharmacokinetics, the two available angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors captopril and enalapril have proved to be comparably effective in controlling essential and renal forms of hypertension in studies of once and twice daily dosing. Abundant data from controlled clinical trials and worldwide experience, particularly for captopril, indicate the safety and absence of subjective side effects when used alone in relatively low dosage or in combination with a diuretic.", 
    "109": "1 Indomethacin (10(-4)M) causes marked augmentation of O-2 release from human neutrophils when these are stimulated by either 1,oleoyl-2,acetylglycerol or the divalent cation ionophore, A23187, the concentration-response curve for each agent being shifted to the left and the maximum response to each increased. 2 The diacylglycerol kinase inhibitor, R59022 (10(-5)M) has effects very similar to those of indomethacin on both the 1,oleoyl-2,acetylglycerol-induced and the A23187-induced concentration-response curves for O-2 generation. 3 The diacylglycerol lipase inhibitor, RHC80267 (10(-5 M) on the other hand, has a similar effect to indomethacin on 1,oleoyl-2,acetylglycerol-induced O2- generation but, unlike indomethacin, has no effect on A23187-induced O2- generation. Comparison of the effects of these three agents provides a clue to the locus of the action of indomethacin in increasing superoxide release, suggesting that it may act as a diacylglycerol kinase inhibitor. A component of diacylglycerol lipase inhibition may also be present. It is suggested that these results could have relevance for the use of indomethacin as an anti-inflammatory agent in chronic rheumatoid diseases.", 
    "110": "In a pharmacokinetic drug interaction study, the purpose is to determine whether the coadministration of a drug A with a second drug B alters the absorption/distribution/metabolism/elimination profile of either drug. While the usual design for such studies is a three-period crossover, it cannot be analyzed as such, because the plasma-level data of drug B will be 0 when drug A is given alone, and vice versa. The easiest way to proceed is to do two sets of paired analyses, one on the absorption profile of A (A vs AB), and the other on the absorption profile of B (B vs AB). A complete separation of the total sources of variation and degrees of freedom is presented along with a numerical example.", 
    "111": "1 The pharmacokinetics of pentopril in elderly subjects aged 70 to 75 years were compared with those of healthy young subjects aged 22 to 26 years. 2 There were no appreciable differences between the two groups in any of the pharmacokinetic parameters for pentopril derived from its plasma data (Cmax, tmax, AUC and t1/2). 3 In contrast, the active metabolite CGS 13934 exhibited an increase in mean values of AUC by 56% in elderly compared to young. However, the difference was not statistically significant (0.1 greater than P greater than 0.05). The variability was, however, significantly higher (P less than 0.05) in the elderly group compared with young. The peak time for metabolite was also significantly delayed in elderly (3.9 vs 2.5 h). The mean half-life for metabolite however, was comparable for the two groups (3.6 vs 3.9 h). 4 Urinary analysis showed a significant decrease in renal clearance (CLR) with age for both pentopril (107 vs 203 ml min-1) and its active metabolite (116 vs 205 ml min-1). 5 Pharmacodynamic measurements of the renin-angiotensin system, in general, demonstrated a drug effect at 2 h with recovery almost to the basal value at 24 h except for plasma ACE activity at 24 h in the elderly. 6 Because of large variability and an increase in the mean AUC of active metabolite in elderly, greater caution may be necessary for dose selection in this group. However, no substantial difference in extent of drug accumulation is anticipated in elderly compared with young people based on the similarity in t1/2 values.", 
    "112": "Cilazapril is a new potent inhibitor of the angiotensin-converting enzyme. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effects of chronic treatment with cilazapril on hemodynamics and regional blood flows in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Cilazapril or distilled water was given by gavage for 9 weeks to hypertensive rats at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day, and arterial blood pressure was monitored each week by an indirect method. After the 9 weeks of treatment, blood pressure was measured by a direct method, and regional blood flows, regional vascular resistances, and cardiac output and its distribution were measured with the radioactive microsphere technique. The cilazapril-treated group was compared with the group that received distilled water. Cilazapril had a very pronounced antihypertensive effect which was due to a general peripheral vasodilatation. The regional vascular resistances were decreased in all the organs except the heart. Cardiac output was unchanged, as well as its distribution. Heart rate was lower in the cilazapril-treated group than in the control group. Cardiac hypertrophy was reduced by cilazapril. We conclude that cilazapril is an antihypertensive agent which acts by dilating most of the peripheral vascular beds and which reduces cardiac hypertrophy.", 
    "113": "The production of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is known to be increased by glucocorticoids, thyroid hormones and converting enzyme inhibitors. We have recently reported that active cAMP analogues also stimulate production of the enzyme. The effect of stimulation of adenylate cyclase in cultured endothelial cells or of phosphodiesterase inhibition on ACE production was therefore evaluated. The phosphodiesterase inhibitor, isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX) (10(-4) M), produced 10.5 +/- 1.3 and 1.3 +/- 0.1 (P less than 0.01 and P greater than 0.1) fold increases in extracellular and cellular cAMP levels and a 1.55 +/- 0.10 (P less than 0.0001) fold increase in ACE accumulation. The adenylate cyclase stimulator, forskolin (0.01-10 microM), acutely stimulated cellular cAMP accumulation in a dose-dependent manner, reaching a 2.8 +/- 0.1-fold increase at 10 microM. After 48 h exposure to 10 microM forskolin, significant increases in cellular (1.90 +/- 0.38-fold increase, P less than 0.0001) and extracellular cAMP (2.35 +/- 0.26-fold increase, P less than 0.0001) were also observed but ACE accumulation was unchanged (108 +/- 10% of control, P greater than 0.5). The beta-adrenoceptor agonist, isoproterenol (1-1000 nM), acutely stimulated cellular cAMP accumulation, with a threshold effect at 10 nM, an ED50 of approximately 30 nM, and a plateau effect of 2.0 +/- 0.13-fold increase by 100 nM. After 48 h exposure to isoproterenol (1 microM), extracellular cAMP levels were increased significantly (1.68 +/- 0.33-fold increase, P less than 0.01) but ACE production was slightly inhibited (83 +/- 7% of control, P less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "114": "The ventilation-perfusion match under therapy with captopril was registered in 14 patients with secondary pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure caused by chronic obstructive lung disease. In none of the cases, changes of cranialisation of the perfusion or increasing ventilation-perfusion mismatch was found, but a significant fall in O2 was seen in all patients. This O2-depression is due to decreasing stroke volume of the right to left shunt.", 
    "115": "A double-blind, randomized, crossover trial was undertaken to compare the effect of enoximone (150 mg, 3 times daily) and captopril (25 mg, 3 times daily) added to conventional therapy with diuretics in the treatment of 13 patients with severe chronic heart failure. Each treatment was continued for 1 month. Heart failure was due to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy in 6 patients and coronary artery disease in 7. Hemodynamic measurements were made at rest and during exercise, on entry to the study and after each treatment period. The cardiac index at rest was 1.9 +/- 0.2 liters min-1 m2 (mean +/- 1 standard deviation) and did not change with either drug. Systemic vascular resistance at rest decreased with enoximone (p less than 0.05) and was unchanged with captopril. Systemic vascular resistance at peak exercise was not lowered by either drug. Both drugs caused an increase of cardiac index at peak exercise (p less than 0.04) and a prolongation of exercise time (p less than 0.05). No difference was detected between the hemodynamic response to the 2 drugs after 1 month treatment either at rest or during exercise.", 
    "116": "Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) activity was measured with hippurylhistidylleucine as a substrate in isolated human glomeruli. The mean level was 2.2 +/- 0.47 mIU/mg glomerular protein. S9780, a newly designed competitive inhibitor of ACE, inhibited this activity by 85% at 0.3 microM. [3H]S9780 specifically bound to isolated human glomeruli. The Kd value and the number of sites were 23 nM and 83 fmol/mg, respectively. The prodrug, S9490, and Captopril were less potent than S9780 in displacing [3H]S9780 from its binding sites. Angiotensin I had no effect. Binding of [3H]S9780 was inhibited after preincubation of the glomeruli with a specific polyclonal anti-human ACE antibody. These results demonstrate that ACE is present in human adult glomeruli.",

The compounds were isolated from plasma and urine under acidic conditions using XAD-2 resin or Extrelut 1 columns. Following derivatization with diazomethane, the samples were analysed by packed-column gas chromatography-electron-impact mass spectrometry with selected-ion monitoring. The analysis of spiked plasma and urine samples demonstrated the good accuracy and precision of the method, which is suitable for use in pharmacokinetic and bioavailability studies with the new angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor prodrug I.HCl in humans.", 
    "118": "MC-838, calcium (-)-N-[(S)-3-(N-cyclohexylcarbonyl-D-alanyl) thio]-2-methylpropionyl]-L- prolinate, is a new orally active angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor in which the mercapto-group is taken up in a stable thiolester linkage. The linkage was relatively resistant against enzymatic hydrolysis by rat liver homogenates. The ACE prepared from rabbit lung was inhibited by MC-838 in a concentration-dependent manner. In isolated rat aortic ring and guinea-pig ileum preparations, MC-838 was highly specific in suppressing the contractile response to angiotensin-I (A-I) an in augmenting the contractile one to bradykinin. However, the ACE inhibitory activity of MC-838 was 30-100 times less potent than that of captopril. In conscious two-kidney (2 KG), renal hypertensive rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), MC-838 (3 and 10 mg/kg) given orally caused a long-lasting hypotensive effect with a slow onset. When compared on a weight basis (3 mg/kg), the antihypertensive effect of MC-838 was comparable to that of captopril in magnitude, but the duration of action of MC-838 was approximately 2 times longer than that of captopril.", 
    "119": "The cost of treating hypertension is high. In the Federal Republic of Germany the total sales of antihypertensive compounds increased, from 1981 to 1984, from 1075 million to 1525 million DM per year, corresponding to 7.4 and 9.1%, respectively, of total drug expenditure. Economists have calculated that about two-thirds of this increase is caused by structural changes within the market, i.e. changing prescription patterns. The proportion of prescribed daily doses of reserpine combinations dropped from 52 to 34% whereas that of most other compounds increased. The approximate daily costs of treatment vary from 0.5 DM (reserpine combinations) to 2.5 DM [angiotensin converting enzyme, (ACE) inhibitors], but the decline of the cheaper compounds and their substitution by newer and more expensive drugs has resulted in additional costs of 309-328 million DM. The higher prices of the new drugs should be justified by greater benefits compared with conventional compounds. Assessment of new antihypertensive drugs should include potency, efficacy, number and quality of adverse effects, and impact on quality of life. The evaluation should be performed separately for mild and for more severe forms of hypertension. Some advantages or drawbacks of the newer drugs may be important for small subgroups only.", 
    "120": "The present study was designed to evaluate the regional vascular profile of milrinone in the setting of experimental heart failure. Utilizing the rat model of myocardial infarction and failure (average infarct size 28%), we measured cardiac output (CO), arterial pressure (MAP), LVEDP, heart rate and systemic vascular resistance, as well as regional blood flow (radioactive microspheres 15 +/- 5 microns) before and after milrinone i.v. (20 microns/kg bolus, 3 micrograms/kg/min infusion) in the conscious state (LVEDP 22 mm Hg versus 10 mm Hg in the sham-operated group, p less than 0.01). Similarly, central hemodynamics and regional blood flow were determined before and after dobutamine or captopril, administering equipotent doses. Milrinone reduced LVEDP more than dobutamine, both more than captopril; MAP was decreased by captopril only. Although all three drugs reduced SVR to a similar extent and increased CO, a quite different blood flow distribution occurred. Improvement in flow to skeletal muscle and splanchnic circulatory bed was exerted by milrinone only. Thus, milrinone attenuated the vasoconstriction in those circulations known to be impaired in heart failure. In contrast to captopril, the effects of milrinone on renal perfusion were modest. These results demonstrate the potent vasodilator activity of milrinone, which is independent of its direct-positive inotropic effects, being most prominent in the splanchnic, coronary and skeletal muscle circulation. The latter might have clinical relevance since improved muscular flow during exercise is likely to improve exercise capacity in heart failure after long-term treatment.", 
    "121": "An examination of the principal physiological actions of angiotensin II should make it clear why in vivo attempts to inhibit the rate of angiotensin II generation have been an attractive avenue in pursuing control of high blood pressure. The major physiological effect of angiotensin II relates to its direct pressor effect, but there are supplementary blood pressure regulating actions. Therefore, if we limit the rate of angiotensin II generation by inhibiting the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) we should expect to control high blood pressure in a number of clinical syndromes. This paper reviews the future of ACE inhibitors in the treatment of conditions such as hypertension associated with unilateral renal artery stenosis, essential hypertension and severe and previously unresponsive hypertension, with respect not only to efficacy but also to the side-effect profile and ancillary properties. Side effects seen with this class of drug are cough, rashes (both morbilliform and urticarial) and, rarely, angio-oedema. Proteinuria, nephrotic syndrome, leukopenia and taste disturbance were previously reported with captopril but only taste disturbance, and that less frequently, is apparent at the lower doses now employed. Several studies have examined the 'quality-of-life' aspects of ACE therapy and have usually but not always reported favourably. There are features of the ACE inhibitors which make them attractive drugs, and while we should be cautious because of limited experience, we should critically and creatively examine their properties over the next years.", 
    "122": "Adult Rana temporaria, acclimated to tap water or hyperosmotic (0.9% NaCl saline) media, were injected with Acetazolamide, Frusemide, or Captopril, or were nephrectomized and injected with captopril. Saline-injected animals served as controls. Total water flux and drinking rates were determined by body weight changes and by the rate of accumulation of an environmental marker (phenol red) in the gut, respectively. Changes in plasma corticosteroids and ion concentrations were also assessed. Acetazolamide and frusemide produced hyponatraemia in tap water-acclimated animals, but induced increased aldosterone levels in frogs in both environments. Captopril reduced body weight and aldosterone levels of tap water frogs, but had no effect on plasma ion composition. Animals treated with captopril on immersion in saline had plasma hypoosmotic to their environment. Saline-acclimated frogs drank less environmental water than did those in tap water. Captopril, acetazolamide, and frusemide all stimulated drinking rates of saline-acclimated frogs; captopril, however, had no effect on the drinking rates of nephrectomized animals, indicating that the dipsogenic actions of this drug are probably reflected by inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. In tap water animals, acetazolamide stimulated drinking, while frusemide stimulated integumental water uptake. No correlation was apparent between plasma aldosterone and corticosterone concentrations, or between changes in body weight and drinking rates. This suggests that there are independent mechanisms controlling aldosterone and corticosterone secretion, as well as integumentary and buccal uptake of water in R. temporaria.", 
    "123": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-induced renal failure has been reported in bilateral renal artery stenosis and in stenosis in solitary kidneys, but not in unilateral renal artery stenosis. In these patients, however, a functional impairment of the kidney ipsilateral to the stenosis can often be detected after ACE inhibition by scintigraphic techniques employing glomerular radionuclide tracers like 99mTc-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA). Dynamic renal scintigraphy with 99mTc-DTPA before and 1 hour after administration of captopril, 25 mg (renal scintigraphic captopril test; RSCT), was performed in a selected series of 39 hypertensive subjects with suspected renovascular hypertension. Changes in glomerular filtration rate induced by captopril on the individual kidney were estimated by assessing the early (120-180 seconds) DTPA uptake by the kidney. Values were expressed as the ratio between the kidney with the lower uptake and the contralateral one in 34 patients and as the ratio of the kidney counts to the injected dose in five patients with solitary kidneys, aortic coarctation, or both. Compared with precaptopril values, postcaptopril uptake decreased markedly in 14 subjects (-62.42 +/- 30.94 [SD]%; range, -25 to -100%) and decreased modestly or even increased in the other 25 (+0.57 +/- 9.83%; range, +28 to -13%). Of the 14 subjects considered to be RSCT-positive diagnostic workup revealed either established (10) or strongly suspected (2) renal artery stenosis in 12 and aortic coarctation in 2 subjects. In another patient with established renovascular hypertension, results of the RSCT were negative when performed in the supine position but became positive when repeated in the sitting position.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "124": "Captopril facilitates detection of unilateral renovascular hypertension by selectively reducing glomerular filtration rate in affected kidneys. To determine if volume depletion augments this response, we compared the effects of captopril, furosemide, and combined furosemide plus captopril on individual kidney computer-derived clearances of 99mTc-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) and [131I]o-iodohippurate in two-kidney, one clip Goldblatt hypertensive rats and normal controls. In clipped kidneys, captopril reduced DTPA clearance significantly from baseline (from 0.31 +/- 0.02 to 0.19 +/- 0.04 ml/min/100 g; p less than 0.02) whereas furosemide alone had no effect (0.28 +/- 0.03 ml/min/100 g). Combined furosemide plus captopril further reduced clipped kidney DTPA clearance to a level significantly less than captopril alone (0.10 +/- 0.02 ml/min/100 g; p less than 0.02). Clipped kidney o-iodohippurate clearance was not changed from baseline by any treatment. In contralateral unclipped and normal kidneys, DTPA clearance did not decline from baseline following either captopril or furosemide plus captopril treatment. Since the dose of captopril used (3 mg/kg by intraperitoneal injection) did not reduce systolic blood pressure of hypertensive rats significantly, these changes probably reflect intrarenal rather than systemic hemodynamic effects of converting enzyme inhibition and are consistent with the hypothesis that captopril interferes with glomerular filtration in stenotic kidneys by reducing efferent arteriolar vascular resistance. Prior volume depletion accentuates the effect of captopril on stenotic kidney glomerular filtration rate, providing improved functional discrimination of stenotic kidneys from contralateral unclipped and normal kidneys. These results indicate that furosemide-induced volume depletion may increase the diagnostic sensitivity of captopril-enhanced 99mTc-DTPA renography in the detection of unilateral renovascular hypertension.", 
    "125": "The mechanisms by which neurotensin (NT) was inactivated by rat fundus plasma membranes were characterized. Primary inactivating cleavages occurred at the Arg8-Arg9, Pro10-Tyr11, and Ile12-Leu13 peptidyl bonds. Hydrolysis at the Arg8-Arg9 bond was fully abolished by the use of N-[1(R,S)-carboxy-2-phenylethyl]-alanyl-alanyl-phenylalanine-p- aminobenzoate, a result indicating the involvement at this site of a recently purified soluble metallopeptidase. Hydrolysis of the Pro10-Tyr11 bond was totally resistant to N-benzyloxycarbonyl-prolyl-prolinal and thiorphan, an observation suggesting that the peptidase responsible for this cleavage was different from proline endopeptidase and endopeptidase 24.11 and might correspond to a NT-degrading neutral metallopeptidase recently isolated from rat brain synaptic membranes. The enzyme acting at the Ile12-Leu13 bond has not yet been identified. Secondary cleavages occurring on NT degradation products were mainly generated by bestatin-sensitive aminopeptidases and post-proline dipeptidyl aminopeptidase. The content in NT-metabolizing peptidases present in rat fundus plasma membranes is compared with that previously established for purified rat brain synaptic membranes.", 
    "126": "To study the interrelationship between myocardial norepinephrine content, left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) function, morphological changes, and plasma catecholamine concentrations, 20 patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy underwent endomyocardial biopsy and ventricular angiography. The strongest correlation was found between LV ejection fraction (EF) and myocardial norepinephrine content (r = 0.87; p less than 0.001). Myocardial norepinephrine content was much weaker correlated to RV EF (r = .55; p less than 0.005), and no correlation was found to morphological changes or plasma norepinephrine concentration. The hemodynamic and neurohumoral effects of hydralazine versus captopril after the first dose were compared in a crossover trial including 15 patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Hydralazine induced increases in heart rate and cardiac index (p less than 0.01) and decreases in mean arterial pressure and pulmonary wedge pressure (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.005, respectively). These hemodynamic effects were associated with increased plasma norepinephrine concentrations during upright exercise (p less than 0.05) and increased plasma renin activity (p less than 0.01). After captopril, norepinephrine plasma concentrations showed a tendency to lower levels during upright exercise, although mean arterial pressure decreased significantly (p less than 0.01). These data suggest that, in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, myocardial norepinephrine depletion strongly reflects left ventricular dysfunction. The different patterns of neurohumoral response to hydralazine versus captopril may be important for their long-term effect and for the prognosis of patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. It remains to be established whether the myocardial catecholamine content is differently influenced by either drug, and whether this effect is related to the drug response after long-term treatment.", 
    "127": "Fifty-five patients of both sexes, aged 39-72, suffering from congestive heart failure of varying aetiology were admitted to a double blind study in which enalapril given in a dose of 5-10 mg twice daily or placebo was added to existing medication. A significant increase in exercise performance (P less than 0.004) was seen in the group treated with enalapril, an improvement which was still evident after 24 weeks of therapy. No significant difference was seen between the mean ejection fractions but subjective assessment suggested improvement in the enalapril-treated group.", 
    "128": "A group of 205 patients with mild to moderate essential uncomplicated hypertension was chosen from 3,183 hypertensive patients referred to a hypertension clinic for the first time, and was asked to participate in a six-month double-blind parallel trial. A single physician was in charge of all the patients. After a two-week single-blind placebo period, the patients were randomly assigned to regimens of either enalapril (20 mg per day) or placebo. Both groups were then followed up every two weeks, and increasing doses of hydrochlorothiazide (25 and 50 mg), oxprenolol (160 and 320 mg), and dihydralazine (50 and 100 mg) were added until the diastolic blood pressure was lower than 90 mm Hg. After a six-month follow-up, the enalapril group showed lower systolic and diastolic blood pressures than the control group (129/82 +/- 12/6 mg Hg versus 135/86 +/- 10/5 mm Hg; p less than 0.001). The number of daily tablets of active drugs was 2.7 +/- 1.8 in the enalapril group and 4.4 +/- 2.4 in the control group (p less than 0.01). The mean plasma potassium level was 4.16 +/- 0.4 mmol/liter in the enalapril group versus 3.92 +/- 0.4 mmol/liter in the control group (p less than 0.001), despite more frequent use of amiloride (p less than 0.001). This difference is explained by the lower dose of hydrochlorothiazide used in the enalapril group by comparison to the control group, and a lower excretion of urinary aldosterone in the enalapril group than in the control group (11.6 +/- 7.4 versus 19.8 +/- 11.8 micrograms per 24 hours, p less than 0.001). Drug withdrawal was necessary in eight patients in the enalapril group and in 16 patients in the control group (p less than 0.05). These results show that first-step treatment of mild to moderate uncomplicated essential hypertension with enalapril permits better blood pressure control than the standard treatment, requires fewer tablets to be taken daily, and involves a smaller risk of hypokalemia.", 
    "129": "Various angiotensins, bradykinins, and related peptides were examined for their inhibitory activity against several enkephalin-degrading enzymes, including an aminopeptidase and a dipeptidyl aminopeptidase, purified from a membrane-bound fraction of monkey brain, and an endopeptidase, purified from the rabbit kidney membrane fraction. Angiotensin derivatives having a basic or neutral amino acid at the N-terminus showed strong inhibition of the aminopeptidase. Dipeptidyl aminopeptidase was inhibited by angiotensins II and III and their derivatives, whereas the endopeptidase was inhibited by angiotensin I and its derivatives. The most potent inhibitor of aminopeptidase and dipeptidyl aminopeptidase was angiotensin III, which completely inhibited the degradation of enkephalin by enzymes in monkey brain or human CSF. The Ki values for angiotensin III against aminopeptidase, dipeptidyl aminopeptidase, endopeptidase, and angiotensin-converting enzyme, which degraded enkephalin, were 0.66 X 10(-6), 1.03 X 10(-6), 2.3 X 10(-4), and 1.65 X 10(-6) M, respectively. Angiotensin III potentiated the analgesic activity of Met-enkephalin after intracerebroventricular coadministration to mice in the hot plate test. Angiotensin III itself also displayed analgesic activity in that test. These actions were blocked by the specific opiate antagonist naloxone.",

    "131": "In mild to moderate hypertension the benefit:risk ratio of treatment cannot be predicted for an individual patient. Antihypertensive drug therapy can therefore only be justified if the patient's quality of life remains unimpaired. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are considered to improve the 'quality of life'. However, only two trials have assessed the influence of antihypertensive drugs on 'quality of life', and it is interesting that both used captopril as a comparative drug. Although both studies differed in their 'quality-of-life' definitions and in their assessment methods, in the overall analysis of change, both favoured captopril. There are no published trials comparing the effects of enalapril with other antihypertensive agents on major aspects of quality of life. Our own results show that enalapril and atenolol are equivalent, both in terms of antihypertensive efficacy and incidence of side effects.", 
    "132": "Instrumented normotensive and two-kidney, one clip Goldblatt hypertensive dogs were placed on normal salt, high salt and DOCA-salt regimens and the effect on mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and iliac vascular resistance (IVR) determined. High salt and DOCA-salt did not alter these variables in the Goldblatt hypertensive group. DOCA-salt increased MAP in the normotensives by 12 mmHg; however, IVR was not significantly increased by this treatment. In order to determine the degree of sympathetic tone in the iliac vascular bed, the change in IVR evoked by the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonists, urapidil and prazosin, was assessed. There were similar reductions in MAP and IVR after alpha 1-blockade in both groups of dogs, regardless of the salt regimen. However, urapidil caused a greater decrease in MAP in the normotensives than in the hypertensives. Captopril administration after alpha 1-blockade caused further reductions in MAP and IVR in the hypertensives, and in the MAP of the normotensive dogs on normal or high salt, indicating that the renin-angiotensin system maintained blood pressure in these groups. These results suggest that sympathetic tone is not increased by high salt- or DOCA-salt in normotensive or Goldblatt hypertensive dogs for the 8-11 day duration of these treatments.", 
    "133": "1 To compare the haemodynamic effects of secondary characteristics of beta-adrenoceptor blockers with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor forty patients with previously untreated mild to moderate hypertension were prescribed either atenolol 50-100 mg day-1, labetalol 200-800 mg day-1, pindolol 10-30 mg day-1 or captopril 25-100 mg day-1 and observed for 6 months. 2 Over this period: (a) All four drugs produced similar reductions in blood pressure at rest (P less than or equal to 0.01) and after exercise (P less than or equal to 0.01). (b) All four drugs significantly decreased resting forearm (P less than or equal to 0.01) and calf blood flow (P less than or equal to 0.01). They all also caused a significant reduction in the increased calf blood flow following exercise (P less than or equal to 0.01). (c) No drug produced a change in resting forearm vascular resistance, while resting calf vascular resistance was decreased by captopril and pindolol, unaltered by labetalol and increased by atenolol. Post-exercise calf vascular resistance was increased by atenolol, labetalol and pindolol but unaltered by captopril. (d) Although all four drugs produced a fall in resting heart rate this was significantly greater for atenolol and labetalol (P less than or equal to 0.01). All four treatments however significantly reduced the increase in heart rate following exercise (P less than or equal to 0.01). (e) No drug produced any significant change in resting and post-exercise stroke volume/ejection fraction. 3 It is concluded that despite differing modes of action all four drugs reduce limb blood flow. This primarily appears to be a consequence of reduced perfusion pressure associated with limited autoregulation of skeletal muscle circulation. The reduction in arterial vascular resistance produced by captopril and pindolol is inconsistent and does not appear of major benefit in preserving limb blood flow. The reduction in perfusion with the agents studied may in part be related to a fall in cardiac output associated with decreased heart rate. This suggests that captopril may exert antisympathetic activity when used as an antihypertensive agent.", 
    "134": "Chronic responses of systemic hemodynamics and blood pressure counterregulatory (\"pseudo-tolerance\") mechanisms were investigated in matched groups of patients with essential hypertension after 1 month of vasodilator therapy with pinacidil (a direct arterial dilator), prazosin (an alpha 1-adrenergic blocking drug) or captopril (an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor). For equivalent decreases in mean arterial pressure compared with placebo baseline (approximately 8 mm Hg supine and 12 mm Hg upright), prazosin and captopril did not increase cardiac index or heart rate. In contrast, marked decreases in systemic vascular resistance with pinacidil (approximately 25%, p less than 0.05) were accompanied by reflex increases in cardiac index (approximately 20%, p less than 0.05). Activity of the sympathetic nervous system, measured by supine and upright plasma norepinephrine (NE), increased approximately 50% with pinacidil and prazosin (p less than 0.001 each), whereas captopril decreased supine plasma NE by 12% (p less than 0.05) and did not change upright plasma NE. All 3 drugs caused an expansion of height-adjusted blood volume (approximately 14%). Pinacidil and prazosin caused reversible weight gains of 0.9 and 0.7 kg, respectively, whereas captopril reversibly decreased body weight by 0.8 kg (p less than 0.05), suggesting differential effects of the 3 drugs on interstitial fluid volume. During chronic therapy, all 3 drugs may require concomitant diuretic therapy, whereas concomitant sympatholytic therapy may be required with the potent vasodilator pinacidil. Captopril may be associated with the lowest cardiac risk because of its lack of stimulatory effects on the sympathetic nervous system and cardiac index.", 
    "135": "Post-marketing surveillance in general practice represents an important part of the monitoring of adverse events associated with newly introduced drugs. Such a study of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril maleate has been undertaken in 11 710 patients with essential hypertension. Serious adverse events occurred in 1.7% of patients, though most of these were not thought to be related to the treatment. The incidence rates of death (0.09%), stroke (0.11%) and myocardial infarction (0.15%) were compatible with rates predicted from age, sex and blood pressure considerations. Other events reported were hypotension (0.3%), angioneurotic oedema (0.03%), rash (0.5%), taste disturbance (0.2%) and cough (1.0%). The degree of blood pressure reduction attained was similar to that previously reported from pre-marketing development studies, as was the overall nature and frequency of both serious and non-serious adverse events. The most frequently reported event during enalapril therapy was of an improvement in well-being (19.8%).", 
    "136": "A child with nephroblastoma, severe hypertension, polydipsia, and polyuria is presented. Previous reports of this association describe great difficulty in controlling the hypertension by medical means. Captopril provided prompt and continuing control of this child's hypertension and allowed for optimal preparation prior to surgery.", 
    "137": "The roles of the autonomic nervous system, renin-angiotensin system, and arginine vasopressin (AVP) during the onset of ACTH-induced hypertension were investigated in conscious sheep. Autonomic ganglion blockade or combined adrenergic and cholinergic receptor blockade demonstrated that an intact sympathetic nervous system was not essential for the development or maintenance of the hypertension. Autonomic blockade augmented the pressor response to ACTH, indicating that baroreceptor-mediated reflexes normally operate to suppress the degree of hypertension produced by ACTH. Evidence was obtained suggesting that the renin-angiotensin system and AVP may partially contribute to the maintenance of ACTH hypertension in the presence of autonomic blockade. However, the precise mechanism by which ACTH raises arterial pressure remains to be elucidated.", 
    "138": "This study was designed to assess the efficacy of 100 mg atenolol daily, 20 mg enalapril daily and a low-dose combination of 50 mg atenolol and 10 mg enalapril, in reducing blood pressure at rest and during ergometry (50-100 W). Twenty-three men and three women (aged 25-56 years, mean 44.5 +/- 7.4 years) were admitted to this randomized, single (observer)-blind crossover study, which had a 2-week placebo period and 4-week treatment periods. Both atenolol and enalapril provided significant (P less than 0.001) and almost identical reductions in blood pressure at rest. However, during exercise, systolic blood pressure decreased with atenolol and with the combination of atenolol and enalapril by 15.8% and 18.4%, respectively, compared with 6.2% with enalapril monotherapy. The differential effect of atenolol and enalapril was also demonstrated for the rate-pressure product. Twenty-four hours after the last dose, systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly lower (P less than 0.01) with atenolol (139.5/92.8 +/- 17/12 mmHg) than with enalapril (146.8/97.7 +/- 17/9 mmHg). It is concluded that atenolol is significantly more effective in reducing systolic blood pressure during exercise than enalapril, and that the addition of atenolol to enalapril therapy produces a significant supplementary antihypertensive effect.", 
    "139": "A fall in blood pressure occurs, in most patients, within a few hours of a single dose of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. While a serious fall in pressure is unusual in previously untreated essential hypertension, some patients are at risk of severe first-dose hypotension. These include those with treated heart failure, severe hypertension on polypharmacy, 'renin-dependent' renovascular hypertension and the occasional elderly patient. In such groups of patients the incidence of severe, symptomatic first-dose hypotension approaches 10%. This effect is not specific for ACE inhibitor therapy and may well occur as frequently with other drugs in such patients. First-dose hypotension may not be accompanied by tachycardia, possibly as a result of a parasympathomimetic action that may contribute to the first-dose effect. It is generally not possible to predict patients at risk, although plasma renin and angiotensin II concentrations show a modest positive correlation with the initial fall in blood pressure. The maximum initial hypotensive effect of ACE inhibitors is not clearly dose related but the duration of effect may be. Therefore such drugs should be started at minimum effective dosage. High-risk patients should be observed closely for at least 6 h. Symptomatic hypotension usually responds to supine rest although infusion of angiotensin II, atropine and occasionally saline may be required.", 
    "140": "Enalapril in single doses of 5 and 10 mg and atenolol in a single dose of 50 mg were given to 16 hypertensive patients on long-term treatment with bendrofluazide, 5 mg daily, in a double-blind randomized crossover placebo controlled study. Both doses of enalapril and atenolol produced similar effects on blood pressure. The mean maximal reduction in blood pressure from baseline with all three active treatments was approximately 32/18 mmHg both supine and standing and occurred on average at 6 h after tablet ingestion. Both supine and standing heart rate fell significantly after atenolol, but no significant change occurred after enalapril. This study establishes that 5 mg enalapril is the maximal starting dose that need be used in hypertensive patients already on diuretic treatment. Even this dose may be hazardous in some patients. The study also serves to emphasize that such combination-therapy studies should be carried out at an early stage in drug development, prior to widespread prescription to patients, in order to avoid unnecessary overdosage with new agents.", 
    "141": "The effect of clonidine, on alpha 2-agonist and antihypertensive, on the progression of chronic renal disease was studied in rats subjected to partial nephrectomy. Treatments began four weeks after the removal of approximately 70% of renal mass. Clonidine was given once daily by gavage on an increasing dose schedule of 50 micrograms/kg for 4 weeks, followed by 100 micrograms/kg for 8 weeks and finally 200 micrograms/kg for 6 weeks. Measurements of renal functions were made at 4 week-intervals during treatment. After 18 weeks, clonidine-treated rats had lower levels of plasma urea nitrogen (P less than 0.05) and plasma creatinine (P less than 0.05). Urinary protein excretion rates were lower in clonidine-treated rats while receiving 100 micrograms/kg at 8 weeks (P less than 0.05) and 200 micrograms/kg at 18 weeks (P less than 0.05). At the end of the treatment period, anesthetized clonidine-treated rats had a numerically lower mean arterial pressure (p = 0.08), but no difference in the histological ranking of light microscopic lesions (P greater than 0.10). Based on the functional data, we conclude that clonidine retards the deterioration of renal function in this model of chronic renal disease. The lack of a consistent effect of clonidine on proteinuria and no reduction in the severity of morphological damage indicates that clonidine is less effective than previously reported treatment in this model with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition. These differences in efficacy may be related to differences in intraglomerular hemodynamic alterations and could be an important consideration in the selection of therapies for individuals with hypertension and renal insufficiency.", 
    "142": "Cystinuria is characterized by cystine stone formation and loss of renal function. Conservative therapy is generally ineffective and penicillamine therapy can be complicated by serious side effects. To our knowledge, we report the first clinical use of captopril in the treatment of homozygous cystinuria in two siblings. In the first patient, a 70% reduction in cystine excretion was observed after 26 weeks of therapy with 150 mg/d of captopril. Discontinuation of use of the drug resulted in a return to baseline cystine excretion, further loss of renal function, and nephrotic range proteinuria. Repeated treatment with captopril stabilized renal function, reduced proteinuria, and returned cystine excretion to near normal levels. In the second patient, cystine excretion was reduced by 93% after nine weeks of therapy with 75 mg/d of captopril. No adverse side effects were observed in either patient. Formation of the captopril-cysteine disulfide accounts for part of the reduction in cystine excretion but other mechanisms probably contribute. Because captopril-cysteine disulfide is 200 times more soluble than cystine, long-term captopril therapy may be useful in the treatment of cystinuria.", 
    "143": "The effect of strict blood pressure control on progression of renal disease in patients with essential hypertension has not been well defined. We have followed prospectively for three years 23 patients with essential hypertension. Blood pressure was well controlled on either enalapril or enalapril-hydrochlorothiazide therapy. Yearly assessment of renal function revealed no change in glomerular filtration rate as assessed by creatinine or inulin clearance, and a sustained 17% increase in effective renal plasma flow. In patients with moderately impaired renal function (inulin clearance less than or equal to 1.33 mL/s [80 mL/min]), there was a first-year 50% increase in inulin clearance, and a 33% increase in inulin clearance at year three. In these patients, there was a 39% first-year increase in effective renal plasma flow, which was sustained at year three. Filtration fraction and urinary protein excretion were unchanged. These results suggest that long-term blood pressure control with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril or enalapril-hydrochlorothiazide is associated with preservation and/or improvement in renal function.", 
    "144": "Forty patients over 70 years old with a diastolic blood pressure of 95 to 110 mm Hg and/or a systolic blood pressure of 170 to 220 mm Hg after two weeks' placebo therapy underwent a single-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized cross-over study using captopril and triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide (Dyazide). Blood pressure was lowered from a mean of 189 +/- 2.0/92 +/- 1.7 mm Hg (mean +/- SEM) to 161 +/- 2.8/78 +/- 1.7 mm Hg with captopril therapy, and therapy with triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide produced similar reductions (156 +/- 2.7/78 +/- 1.7 mm Hg). Two patients on triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide therapy withdrew because of side effects, while only minor side effects were observed with captopril therapy. Therapy with triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide produced significant elevation of urea, creatinine, and uric acid, while captopril therapy produced no biochemical or hematologic changes. A single daily dose of captopril alone was sufficient to normalize the blood pressure in 31 (75%) of 40 patients. Captopril appears to be a promising monotherapy for the elderly with mild to moderate hypertension.", 
    "145": "The role of cyclic AMP in regulating the production of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) was investigated using cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells. Addition of dibutyryl cAMP [Bu)2cAMP) at 100 microM increased the ACE activity to 126% of control (P less than 0.005). This effect was blocked by either actinomycin D (0.1 microgram/ml) or cycloheximide (1.7 microM) indicating that RNA as well as protein synthesis was required for induction of the enzyme. After addition of (Bu)2cAMP, a lag period of 8 h was observed before increased ACE activity was detected. The stable analogues, 8-bromo cAMP (100 microM) and N6-monobutyryl cAMP (100 microM) also increased ACE activity but cAMP (100 microM) and O2-monobutyryl cAMP (100 microM) had no effect, in keeping with their susceptibility to phosphodiesterase in this system. Sodium butyrate (100 microM) was also inactive. The effect of (Bu)2cAMP on ACE was still observed in the presence of a maximal dose of dexamethasone, indicating that (Bu)2cAMP stimulates by mechanism(s) independent of the previously observed action of glucocorticoids on these cells. The phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX caused a dose-related increase in ACE activity with a threshold at 30 microM (P less than 0.05) and produced a 4-fold increase above control at 1 mM IBMX.", 
    "146": "Inhibition of the kallikrein-kinin system with aprotinin, and measurements of urinary kallikrein and kinin excretion, were used to examine a possible involvement of endogenous kinins in mediating the acute antihypertensive and renal actions of captopril in conscious, unstressed spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Captopril, 30 mg/kg + 300 micrograms/kg/min, caused an acute significant decrease in mean arterial pressure. Urinary kallikrein excretion tended to decrease, while kinin excretion tended to decrease, while kinin excretion tended to increase after captopril, without reaching statistical significance. Renal water and electrolyte excretion remained practically unchanged. Aprotinin, 1,000 KIU/kg/min, had no effect on mean arterial pressure, whereas it decreased urinary kallikrein activity to undetectable levels and lowered kinin excretion by 21% (p less than 0.05). Urine flow remained unchanged, but sodium/potassium excretion ratio increased significantly during aprotinin infusion. When captopril and aprotinin were infused in combination, the decrease in mean arterial pressure was not significantly different from that seen when captopril was given alone. Although urinary kallikrein activity decreased below the detection limit of our assay, urinary kinin, as well as water and electrolyte excretion, remained relatively stable during the combined infusion. The present results provide direct evidence that the acute antihypertensive effect of captopril in conscious SHR is probably not due to an increased kinin accumulation secondary to the inhibition of kininase II. Our findings also suggest that under basal conditions intrarenal renin-angiotensin and kallikrein-kinin systems may play a minor role, if any, in the regulation of renal water and electrolyte excretion.", 
    "147": "S-9780 is the active diacid metabolite of the new angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor perindopril. In a double-blind, randomised, crossover study, the effects of 1, 2, and 4 mg of S-9780 administered intravenously (i.v.) were compared with placebo in eight normotensive subjects. All active doses caused immediate, maximal, and similar inhibition of plasma ACE with 40% inhibition persisting after 48 h. Plasma renin activity was elevated 4 and 8 h after dosing, but no effect on plasma aldosterone, adrenaline or noradrenaline levels was detected. Diastolic blood pressure was lowered by 4 mg of S-9780 until 24 h after dosing. Heart rate did not change. The pharmacokinetics of S-9780 fitted a three-compartment model with a terminal half-life (t1/2) of 31 h. Inhibition of plasma ACE was closely related to observed drug concentration, with 1.8 +/- 0.9 ng/ml (mean +/- S.D.) producing 50% inhibition of the enzyme. S-9780 caused predictable effects on the cardiovascular and renin angiotensin systems.", 
    "148": "We established the content in neuropeptide-metabolizing peptidases present in highly purified plasma membranes prepared from the circular and longitudinal muscles of dog ileum. Activities were measured by the use of fluorigenic substrates and the identities of enzymes were confirmed by the use of specific peptidase inhibitors. Endopeptidase 24.11, angiotensin-converting enzyme, post-proline dipeptidyl aminopeptidase and aminopeptidases were found in both membrane preparations. Proline endopeptidase was only detected in circular smooth muscle plasma membranes while pyroglutamyl-peptide hydrolase was not observed in either tissue. The relative contribution of these peptidases to the inactivation of neurotensin was assessed. The enzymes involved in the primary inactivating cleavages occurring on the neurotensin molecule were as follows. In both membrane preparations, endopeptidase 24.11 was responsible for the formation of neurotensin-(1-11) and contributed to the formation of neurotensin-(1-10); a recently purified neurotensin-degrading neutral metallopeptidase was also involved in the formation of neurotensin-(1-10). A carboxypeptidase-like activity hydrolysed neurotensin at the Ile12-Leu13 peptide bond, leading to the formation of neurotensin-(1-12). Proline endopeptidase and endopeptidase 24.15 only occurred in circular muscle plasma membranes, yielding neurotensin-(1-7) and neurotensin-(1-8), respectively. In addition, the secondary processing of neurotensin degradation products was catalyzed by the following peptidases. In circular and longitudinal muscle membranes, angiotensin-converting enzyme converted neurotensin-(1-10) into neurotensin-(1-8) and tyrosine resulted from the rapid hydrolysis of neurotensin-(11-13) by bestatin-sensitive aminopeptidases. A post-proline dipeptidyl aminopeptidase activity converted neurotensin-(9-13) into neurotensin-(11-13) in circular muscle plasma membranes. The mechanism of neurotensin inactivation occurring in these membranes will be compared to that previously established for membranes from central origin.", 
    "149": "The effect of peptidase inhibitors on the degradation of [3H]-bradykinin by rat hypothalamic slices was studied using HPLC to separate and identify the products. The degradation appears to be mainly mediated by an enzyme which cleaves the peptide at the Phe5-Ser6 bond and is inhibited by 1,10-phenanthroline, dynorphin(1-13) and carboxyphenylethyl-Ala-Ala-Phe-p-aminobenzoate. This suggest the involvement of a membrane bound variant of the soluble metalloendopeptidase (EC3.4.24.15) isolated from rat brain which degrades neurotensin, angiotensin and other neuropeptides as well as bradykinin.", 
    "150": "The interplay of juxtaglomerular (jg) calcium fluxes and exposure to AII in the regulation of jg renin secretion, was examined in vivo. An inhibitor of angiotensin I converting enzyme (captopril), a blocker of calcium channels (verapamil) and AII amide were infused, singly or in combination, into the ear vein of conscious rabbits. The effects on arterial pressure, and on levels of active and inactive plasma renin were monitored. Captopril (50 micrograms X min-1 X kg-1) produced a greater percentage increase in renin secretion than did verapamil (20 micrograms X min-1 X kg-1), whilst the percentage fall in arterial pressure was similar. AII amide counteracted more effectively the actions of captopril than those of verapamil. When captopril was infused first, addition of verapamil did not enhance renin secretion (P greater than 0.2). When verapamil was infused first, addition of captopril greatly enhance renin secretion (P less than 0.01). However, when captopril was infused first, and its actions then suppressed by AII amide, addition of verapamil led to extremely high rates of renin secretion. The findings suggest the following: the short loop negative feedback plays in vivo an important role in the rapid modulation of jg renin secretion and the action of AII may involve up- and down-regulation at the receptor and/or post-receptor level; infused agents have rapid access to the critical sites of jg cells; exposure to raised concentrations to AII not only reduces the effectiveness of AII, but also enhances jg secretory responses to lack of AII, as well as to calcium channel blockade. Thus, at least some of the jg calcium channels appear to respond both to AII and to blockers; extreme changes in the levels of active renin are possible without changes of inactive renin levels. Secretion of the latter may be under separate control, or its secretion rate parallelled by the rate of its activation.", 
    "151": "Thionoleucine S-anilide (Leut-anilide), Leut-Gly-OEt and Leut-Phe-OMe were synthesized and shown to be competitive inhibitors of leucine aminopeptidase from pig kidney. The kinetics of inhibition were determined in the presence of leucine 4-methylcoumarin-7-amide as substrate. Although the compounds showed only moderate inhibitory potency, it was found that all were resistant to hydrolysis by the enzyme, in contrast with the reported behaviour of some thionopeptide analogues of substrates for other Zn2+-peptidases such as carboxypeptidase A and angiotensin-converting enzyme.", 
    "152": "The leaves of the persimmon Diospyros kaki, have been traditionally used for treatment of hypertensive diseases in Japan. We have studied the inhibitory effects of four flavonoids isolated from the leaves of the persimmon on angiotensin-converting enzyme activity. The four flavonoids astragalin [1], kaempferol-3-O-(2\"-O-galloyl)-glucoside [2], isoquercitrin [3], and quercetin-3-O-(2\"-O-galloyl)-glucoside [4] inhibited the angiotensin-converting enzyme activity in a dose-dependent fashion. Compounds 1-4 produced 67%, 53%, 33%, and 48% inhibition at a concentration of 300 micrograms/ml, respectively. The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of 1 and 2 for the angiotensin-converting enzyme were 180 micrograms/ml and 280 micrograms/ml, respectively. On the other hand, 2 and 4 were shown to have tannin activities, but 1 and 3 had no tannin activities. These results suggest that there is no relationship between the inhibition for angiotensin converting enzyme activity and the tannin activity for the four flavonoids.", 
    "153": "Studies of plasma samples of 3 subjects with Bartter's syndrome were compared to 8 subjects with other conditions. Despite high levels of active renin initially, with low levels of inactive renin, addition of either human nephrectomized plasma or sheep substrate not only increased active renin (by at least 3-fold) but also led to the appearance of large quantities of inactive renin (10-20 times the concentration originally present, much greater than the small increase seen with other plasmas). The activated inactive renin after substrate addition possibly had a larger and more variable molecular size (42,000-48,000) than normal inactive renin (42,500-44,500). Renin substrate in Bartter's plasma was present in similar amounts and had a normal or supranormal angiotensin generation rate with exogenous human renin. Bartter's substrate had a similar molecular weight (55,000) to that found in normal human plasma. The agent in the exogenous substrate preparations causing the increase in apparent active and inactive renin was not ultrafiltrable. However, an acidification procedure that destroyed exogenous substrate also removed the renin-increasing effect. Captopril increased renin but not aldosterone, while amiloride increased aldosterone but not renin. Neither agent improved serum potassium significantly in these patients on indomethacin.", 
    "154": "The mechanism of cyclosporine A (CyA) nephrotoxicity is unclear. In order to evaluate renal microcirculation seven euvolemic Munich-Wistar (MW) rats were studied after acute CyA treatment (50 mg/kg, i.v.). Both total glomerular filtration rate (GFR, 0.96 +/- 0.04 vs. 0.47 +/- 0.07 ml/min) and single nephron GFR (27.90 +/- 3.39 vs. 14.02 +/- 3.49 nl/min) declined significantly (P less than 0.001). It was observed an increase in afferent (RA, increases 188%) and efferent (RE, increases 360%) arteriolar resistances that caused a decrease on glomerular plasma flow rate (QA) from 100.99 +/- 17.09 to 44.37 +/- 13.37 nl/min (P less than 0.001). Mean glomerular capillary hydraulic pressure (PGC) increased from 45 +/- 1 to 55 +/- 4 mm Hg (P less than 0.05) and the glomerular ultrafiltration coefficient (Kf) decreased by 70% (0.096 +/- 0.030 to 0.031 +/- 0.010 nl/sec X mm Hg, P less than 0.05). Additionally, in order to study hormonal participation in this nephrotoxicity, other three groups of MW rats were previously treated with captopril (2 mg/kg, i.v.), verapamil (20 micrograms/kg/min, i.v.) or indomethacin (2 mg/kg, i.v.). Both captopril and verapamil minimized the renal effects of CyA, with a decline of approximately 25% instead of approximately 50% on GFR and RPF. Moreover, two groups of Brattleboro rats were studied. Acute CyA administration in homozygote Brattleboro rats produced a decline of only approximately 22% and approximately 31%, respectively, in GFR and renal plasma flow (RPF), when compared with MW rats (P less than 0.05). Similar results were observed in heterozygote Brattleboro rats when compared with MW rats, disclosing differences due to a different strain of rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "155": "Six patients treated with captopril for severe essential hypertension were studied to determine whether the drug significantly altered circulating peripheral blood T (Thymus derived) lymphocytes and T lymphocyte subsets. OKT3+ (functionally mature T lymphocytes), OKT4+ (class II major histocompatibility complex [MHC] reactive T lymphocytes) and OKT8+ (class I MHC reactive T lymphocytes) T lymphocytes were monitored using monoclonal antibodies and flow cytometry before commencement of treatment and then at intervals during 14 months of captopril administration. Results showed a significant increase in the absolute numbers of OKT4+ cells at 2 h (p less than 0.05) and a decrease at 12 weeks (p less than 0.01) during captopril treatment. These findings indicate that captopril has an effect on cellular immunity in vivo.", 
    "156": "Noncompliance of hypertensive patients to their treatment program is a common problem. The basis of this noncompliance is multifactorial, but a large component is related to the adverse symptoms produced by the commonly prescribed antihypertensive agents. There is increasing evidence that one can use social and behavioral science techniques to quantitate the effect of antihypertensive agents on a patient's quality of life. Thus, in addition to efficacy, serious side effects, and cost, the physician also now will be able to add impact on quality of life as a fourth dimension in determining which antihypertensive program is the most appropriate.", 
    "157": "In order to improve on the technique of noninvasive detection of renal artery stenosis, we studied the effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition with captopril on individual kidney hemodynamics and function as assessed by technetium-99m diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid [( 99mTc]DTPA) renal flow studies and iodine-131 orthoiodohippurate [( 131I]hippuran) renography in experimental Goldblatt's hypertension. In two-kidney, one-clip (renin-dependent) hypertension, captopril (1.5 mg/kg bolus with 1.5 mg/min infusion) reduced mean arterial pressure (MAP) and ipsilateral glomerular filtration rate (GFR) without changes in the contralateral kidney. Captopril infusion resulted in alterations in both the [99mTc]DTPA and [131I]hippuran studies, which were most evident in the 15-min [99mTc]DTPA renal flow studies. In one-kidney, one-clip (volume-dependent) hypertension, captopril reduced MAP but did not alter GFR, renal plasma flow, or the radionuclide studies. These studies suggest that the [99mTc]DTPA renal flow study coupled with captopril challenge may unmask intrarenal angiotensin II-dependent functional and hemodynamic changes of the stenotic kidney, and offers promise in the detection of renin-dependent hypertension.", 
    "158": "We studied the safety and efficacy of intravenous nicardipine alone and in combination with oral captopril. Sixteen patients with essential hypertension received a single oral dose of captopril, 50 mg, to be certain that excessive hypotension would not occur. Nicardipine was given intravenously as a 2 mg bolus, followed by an infusion at a rate designed to lower the supine diastolic blood pressure at least 10 mm Hg; then oral captopril, 50 mg, or placebo was given. The next week, nicardipine was again infused, but the alternate oral treatment was given. Intravenous nicardipine reduced blood pressure from 156 +/- 15/101 +/- 5 mm Hg (mean arterial blood pressure 120 +/- 6 mm Hg) to 140 +/- 11/88 +/- 4 mm Hg (mean arterial blood pressure 105 +/- 5 mm Hg). When captopril was added to nicardipine, the mean arterial blood pressure fell an additional 8 mm Hg but the heart rate did not increase. The combination of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and calcium channel blockage produces additive antihypertensive effects without additional reflex tachycardia.", 
    "159": "The effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor lisinopril on blood pressure, proteinuria and renal hemodynamics were evaluated in 13 patients with renal disease of different origin. A comparison was made with the effects of conventional antihypertensive therapy. Both drug regimens significantly lowered blood pressure, while only after 12 weeks of treatment with lisinopril, blood pressure was significantly lower than during conventional therapy. Lisinopril reduced proteinuria (by 61 +/- 40%), whereas conventional therapy had no significant effect on protein excretion. During the first eight weeks of treatment with lisinopril, there was a comparable degree of blood pressure reduction with both treatment regimens, whereas urinary protein loss was significantly less during ACE inhibition. There was only a nearly-significant positive correlation between the fall in proteinuria during lisinopril and the concomitant decrease in mean arterial pressure. Glomerular filtration rate decreased from 26.3 +/- 11.6 to 20.6 +/- 9.4 ml/min during treatment with lisinopril. This decrease was not correlated with the fall in proteinuria. A significant positive correlation existed between the fall in urinary protein excretion and both the decrease in overall renal vascular resistance, and the fall in filtration fraction. Although blood pressure lowering by itself could contribute to the antiproteinuric effect of lisinopril, our results suggest that this effect of ACE inhibition is also due to efferent (postglomerular) vasodilation. We conclude that the ACE inhibitor lisinopril effectively reduces blood pressure and proteinuria in renal disease. The latter effect is not only the result of a lower blood pressure, but is probably also due to a fall in intraglomerular capillary pressure.", 
    "160": "The effect of a specific inhibitor of thromboxane (Tx) A2 synthesis, CGS-13080, a new angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, CGS-16617, and a combination of both drugs was studied in hemorrhagic shock in rats. Treatment with CGS-16617 (1 microgram/kg) or CGS-13080 (200 micrograms/kg) alone did not alter significantly postoligemic hypotension or the increase in plasma cathepsin D activity in shocked rats, compared with hemorrhaged rats receiving only their vehicle. Combined treatment with both drugs maintained postreinfusion mean arterial blood pressure and attenuated the increase in plasma cathepsin D activity in hemorrhaged rats. Treatment of shocked rats with each drug alone attenuated the accumulation of a myocardial depressant factor activity in the plasma, but the lowest myocardial depressant factor activities were observed in rats treated with the drug combination. Additionally, animals treated with the drug combination exhibited significantly longer postreinfusion survival times than rats receiving either the vehicle (P less than .01), CGS-16617 (P less than .05) or CGS-13080 (P less than .02). CGS-16617 (1 microgram/kg) attenuated significantly the pressor response to angiotensin I throughout the shock period. CGS-13080 attenuated the increase in TxB2 plasma concentrations in shock when compared with hemorrhaged rats receiving the vehicle (P less than .05). Greater attenuation of TxB2 was found after treatment with the drug combination (P less than .01 from vehicle, P less than .05 from CGS-13080 alone). CGS-16617, but not CGS-13080, was also found to have a direct antiproteolytic action in pancreatic homogenates. However, the drug combination (CGS-16617 and CGS-13080) decreased proteolytic activity even further (P less than .001) from CGS-16617 alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "161": "Previous studies have indicated that the hypotensive effects of atrial natriuretic factor were enhanced in renin-dependent hypertensive rats, suggesting that the atrial peptides may antagonize the vasoconstrictor effects of the renin-angiotensin system. The present study was designed to define further the interaction between atrial natriuretic factor and the renin-angiotensin system by examining the hemodynamic effects of Wy-47,663, a synthetic human atrial natriuretic factor, in conscious normotensive rats, in renin-dependent (aortic-ligated) hypertensive rats, and in rats made hypertensive by chronic infusion of angiotensin II. Changes in renal and mesenteric blood flow were continuously monitored in the rats using pulsed Doppler flow probes chronically implanted in the animals one week prior to testing. Infusion of increasing doses of Wy-47,663 caused dose-dependent reductions in mean arterial pressure in all three groups of rats, but the depressor responses were significantly greater in renal hypertensive and angiotensin II-infused rats. Renal blood flow tended to increase during the infusion of the atrial peptide in the angiotensin II-treated rats, and renal vascular resistance fell significantly (-37 +/- 6%). However, Wy-47,663 significantly reduced renal blood flow in the normotensive and renal hypertensive rats, while renal vascular resistance was increased (29 +/- 6%) and unchanged (3 +/- 9%), respectively. Mesenteric blood flow was reduced significantly, and mesenteric vascular resistance was increased markedly in all three groups of rats during infusion of the atrial peptide. In a separate group of renal hypertensive rats, the hemodynamic effects of complete blockade of the renin-angiotensin system were assessed by injection of an angiotensin II converting enzyme inhibitor (Wy-44,655).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "162": "After uninephrectomy in the young rat, renal blood flow (RBF) increases at normal renal perfusion pressure (RPP) but not at reduced RPP. To evaluate the role of endogenous prostaglandins on these effects, RBF was measured during reduction in RPP in rats that were uninephrectomized within 1 wk of age and studied at 33-41 days of age. After acute cyclooxygenase inhibition, autoregulation improved; RBF was unchanged at normal RPP but increased at lower pressures with concomitant decrease in renal venous plasma renin activity (PRA). Prostaglandin inhibition also improved autoregulatory efficiency in acutely uninephrectomized and sham-operated young rats. Infusion of a thromboxane synthesis inhibitor had no effect on the pressure-flow relationship or on PRA, whereas angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition increased RBF at all measured RPP without affecting autoregulation. We conclude that increased RBF at normal RPP in the uninephrectomized young rat is not maintained by increased prostaglandin synthesis or decreased thromboxane- or angiotensin-dependent vasoconstriction. However, by maintaining increased vasoconstriction at reduced RPP, prostaglandin-dependent renin release reduces autoregulatory efficiency in the young rat.", 
    "163": "Micropuncture and morphological studies were performed in three protocols assessing the renal hemodynamic and structural effects of angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitors (CEIs) in the progression of glomerular injury. In protocol I, rats were subjected to 5/6 renal ablation and received no therapy, enalapril (CEI), or triple-drug therapy (TRX) for 12 weeks. Control of systemic and glomerular hypertension with CEI resulted in prevention of glomerular capillary hypertension and protection against glomerular injury. Despite equivalent control of systemic BP, failure of TRX to control glomerular hypertension was associated with no protection against eventual proteinuria and glomerular sclerosis, values for these indexes being as abnormal as in rats receiving no therapy. In protocol II, rats were again subjected to 5/6 renal ablation and followed for 18 weeks. Early institution of CEI soon after ablation again prevented systemic and glomerular hypertension and largely limited glomerular injury. In a third group, enalapril therapy was delayed for 8 weeks after ablation until hypertension and proteinuria were established. Late institution of CEI resulted in prompt reduction in systemic and glomerular capillary hypertension and stabilization of glomerular disease. In protocol III, CEI was administered to normotensive, moderately hyperglycemic diabetic rats. A modest, 20-mm Hg reduction in systemic arterial pressure was associated with the normalization of glomerular capillary pressure and a striking reduction in the development of albuminuria and glomerular injury. These studies suggest that CEI effectively prevent glomerular capillary hypertension and thereby afford protection against glomerular injury in diverse models of progressive renal disease.", 
    "164": "Compensatory mechanisms such as systemic vasoconstriction and sodium retention are activated to various degrees in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) mediates many of these compensatory responses. Increased angiotensin can result in net vasoconstriction and increase afterload. In addition, it contributes to the avid sodium retention that occurs in patients with CHF. The RAS promotes sodium retention by enhancing proximal tubular reabsorption of sodium and water through changes in intrarenal hemodynamics. In addition, the direct renal tubular influence of angiotensin II and aldosterone contribute to sodium retention. In experimental heart failure in the rat, angiotensin activation leads to reduction in effective plasma flow whereas the glomerular filtration rate was unchanged. In clinical CHF, activation of the RAS may also contribute to azotemia in patients with CHF. Significant correlations between serum creatinine levels and plasma renin activity have been observed. Furthermore, renal plasma flow and the glomerular filtration rate frequently improve after therapy with converting-enzyme inhibitors (CEIs). Occasionally, however, CEIs may produce an excessive fall in systemic BP and, hence, renal perfusion pressure, which may overcome autoregulatory mechanisms and contribute to a deterioration in renal function. CEIs enhance the effectiveness of furosemide in promoting natriuresis and correction of hyponatremia. Diuretic-induced hypokalemia can also be corrected by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors due to blockade of aldosterone production. On the basis of these results, we recommend titration of the ACE inhibitors' dose to minimize hypotension and the concurrent use of furosemide in patients with CHF receiving ACE inhibitors, especially for those in whom azotemia, hyponatremia, and hypokalemia complicate the course.", 
    "165": "The renin-angiotensin system appears to have evolved millions of years ago as a primary attempt to preserve circulatory homeostasis at a time when the principal cause of a low cardiac output was intravascular volume depletion. Angiotensin II supported systemic BP by direct systemic vasoconstriction, by facilitating the central and peripheral effects of the sympathetic nervous system, by promoting renal sodium retention by the production of aldosterone, and by increasing total body water by enhancing thirst and the synthesis of vasopressin. In addition, angiotensin II evolved as an important mechanism to preserve the glomerular filtration rate in low-flow states. These actions of angiotensin II were beneficial when the system first evolved, but its activation in patients with heart failure not only fails to reverse the low-output state but further exacerbates loading conditions in the left ventricle, thereby leading to worsening heart failure. Moreover, increased levels of angiotensin II cause heightened sympathetic nervous activity, potassium depletion, and hyponatremia, each of which can lead to further clinical deterioration. Therefore, activation of the renin-angiotensin system in heart failure might appear (at first) to be a maladaptive response. Recent evidence, however, suggests that this hormonal system continues (even in heart failure) to carry out the primary functions for which it was designed. Angiotensin II plays an important role in preserving systemic BP and in preserving the glomerular filtration rate as renal artery pressure and renal blood flow decline; in addition, by stimulating the synthesis of aldosterone, the renin-angiotensin system provides an important role for potassium disposal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "166": "Surgery has been used to treat renal vascular hypertension for almost 50 years. The reason for the many apparent discrepancies in the literature on effectiveness and risk have become clear only in the past decade. The results are poorest and the risk is greater, not surprisingly, in patients with advanced atherosclerosis involving many vascular beds. The results are much better in fibromuscular disease, both in terms of effectiveness and risk. Angioplasty has been available for a much shorter time, but a reasonable picture of the short-term effectiveness and the risk is emerging. The risk is substantially lower than that of surgery. The results are again best in fibromuscular disease. In atherosclerotic disease, the results are especially poor for the most common lesion, that involving the renal artery ostium. Medical therapy before the development of captopril was often difficult and often unsatisfactory. Since the development of converting-enzyme inhibition, medical therapy is an important option. In the early experience, reflecting the severity of the hypertension, the frequency with which azotemia was present, and the high dose of captopril used, the adverse reaction rate was substantial. In one study, none of 133 patients with unilateral renal arterial disease and an intact contralateral kidney developed renal failure. Among 136 patients with bilateral disease or a solitary kidney, renal failure occurred in 15 and led to discontinuation of therapy in 12. If surgery or angioplasty are contraindicated, one can modify the therapeutic goal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "167": "Because the renin-angiotensin system frequently participates in sustaining severe forms of hypertension, early studies with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril were concentrated in patients whose hypertension was refractory to previously available treatment. The effectiveness of captopril, both acutely and during long-term treatment, led to its widespread use for treatment-resistant hypertension. More recently, captopril's efficacy when used as monotherapy and its relative avoidance of symptomatic adverse effects have expanded its role to hypertension of all degrees of severity. A second converting-enzyme inhibitor, enalapril, has been approved for the treatment of hypertension. Its efficacy and clinical characteristics appear similar to those of captopril. In double-blind clinical trials, comparisons with beta-blocker or diuretic therapy have shown captopril to be equal in efficacy but to produce fewer side effects or metabolic changes. In mild-to-moderate essential hypertension it is effective when administered in twice-daily doses of 25 or 50 mg; higher doses do not usually increase its BP-lowering effects. The combination of captopril with a diuretic in low doses has been shown to be especially effective. In additional studies, once-daily doses have controlled BP in a majority of hypertensive patients, but this method of administering captopril has not yet been formally approved. In lower doses, captopril may be less effective in black patients than in white patients, but black patients appear to respond well if the doses are increased. Antihypertensive effects in elderly patients during captopril treatment are equal to those in the young. Converting-enzyme inhibitor therapy appears to have broad utility and a favorable side effect profile in the treatment of essential hypertension.", 
    "168": "Hypertensives with low renin levels are known to be sensitive to salt intake and diuretics. The subset of hypertensives sensitive to salt and having normal or high renin levels are termed nonmodulators. These are patients with essential hypertension who fail to modulate their renal blood flow and aldosterone responsiveness to angiotensin II when dietary sodium is changed. The result of nonmodulation is a pressor response to a short-term sodium load that results from a failure to excrete the sodium appropriately and that is presumably secondary to the defect in renal blood supply. On a high sodium load only nonmodulators have a decrease in BP in response to short-term treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, which indicates an abnormality in intrarenal angiotensin II levels or in the renal angiotensin II receptor.", 
    "169": "The effects of captopril on renal function are evaluated in hypertensive patients with impaired renal function previously entered in a worldwide surveillance study. For the overwhelming majority of patients, control of BP was accompanied by stable or improved renal function. To date, the major adverse renal reactions have been a somewhat increased risk of worsening proteinuria among these patients and the well-documented acute decrease in renal function that may occur in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis.", 
    "170": "The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system plays an integral role in the control of BP and is mediated by enzymatic transformation of substances in the renin-angiotensin cascade. Inhibitors of various reactions in this cascade have been shown experimentally to reduce elevated BP. The first such compound to become available for clinical use was the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril. Captopril reduces BP, with the expected decrease in plasma angiotensin II concentration and increases in renin and angiotensin I levels, but there is also evidence for a non-renin-dependent mechanism of action. In particular, according to cell culture data, captopril stimulates an increase in the synthesis of vasodilatory prostaglandins. Because enalapril, another angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, does not augment in vitro synthesis of prostaglandins, this effect may be unique to the chemical structure of captopril rather than inherent to all such inhibitors. Studies using animal models of hypertension support this hypothesis. Captopril may also influence prostaglandin synthesis by reducing inactivation of bradykinin.", 
    "171": "A specific inhibitor of thromboxane A2 (TxA2) synthesis, CGS-12970, a new angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, CGS-16617, and a combination of both agents were evaluated for their ability to reduce the extension of myocardial infarct size in rats. Myocardial creatine kinase (CK) loss from the left ventricular free wall (LVFW) 48 hr after left coronary artery ligation was used as an index of ischemic damage. Treatment with either CGS-12970 (4 mg/kg) or CGS-16617 (1 microgram/kg) alone did not attenuate the loss of CK from LVFW significantly, compared with animals receiving only the vehicles for these drugs. However, the combined use of both agents significantly reduced CK depletion from LFVW (P less than 0.01). These findings support the interrelated role of TxA2 and angiotensin II as mediators of myocardial ischemia and suggest that combined inhibition of their formation may be useful in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "172": "The three angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors cilazapril, perindopril and CGS 14824A were administered for 8 days to, respectively, 6, 5 and 5 normotensive healthy volunteers maintained on an unrestricted salt intake. Before starting treatment, as well as on the last day of therapy, an ambulatory blood pressure profile was obtained with a semi-automatic blood pressure recorder (Remler M2000). An additional blood pressure recording was performed 1 month after the end of the 8-day course of treatment with cilazapril and CGS 14824A. Eight day ACE inhibition with any of the 3 drugs did not result in a consistent decrease of ambulatory blood pressure recordings. This suggests that in normotensive subjects on a free salt intake the renin-angiotensin system may not be a key determinant of blood pressure.", 
    "173": "Recent findings support the existence of independently functioning, local renin-angiotensin systems in a number of tissues. The clinical importance that inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system have gained in the treatment of hypertension and cardiac failure, as well as molecular biology data, suggest that a functional, tissue renin-angiotensin system is present in the heart. Using several experimental approaches we present evidence to support the existence and the possible physiopathological relevance of such a cardiac renin-angiotensin system. Tissue angiotensins were documented and quantified in different regions of the heart by high performance liquid chromatography combined with specific radio-immunoassay. Reduction of cardiac angiotensin after administration of converting enzyme inhibitors in nephrectomized animals indicates that these peptides are generated locally. Effects of converting enzyme inhibitors on angiotensin II-dependent facilitation of cardiac sympathetic tone further support this concept and emphasize the potential physiological role of a cardiac renin-angiotensin system. Further, direct evidence for local generation of angiotensin II in the myocardium is provided by assessment of the intracardiac conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II and by measurement of the activity of angiotensin converting enzyme in the heart.",

In the vehicle-pretreated animals, 45 min of ANP infusion did not change GFR (control value 1.17 +/- 0.11, experimental value 1.17 +/- 0.06 ml min-1 g-1 kidney wt). Sodium excretion (UNaV) increased more than three-fold from 0.036 +/- 0.010 to 0.134 +/- 0.058 mumol min-1 g-1 kidney wt (p less than 0.05) and potassium excretion (UKV) increased from 0.481 +/- 0.055 to 0.946 +/- 0.068 mumol min-1 g-1 kidney wt (P less than 0.05). Urine osmolality (UOsm) remained unchanged, while the blood pressure (BP) decreased by 15%.

    "175": "The effects of angiotensin II and its precursors angiotensin I and tetradecapeptide renin substrate were investigated in isolated segments of the rat caudal artery. Each peptide constricted the rat caudal artery and also enhanced vasoconstrictor responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation (0.5 Hz, 10 s). The threshold concentrations for each peptide in enhancing sympathetic vasoconstrictor responses were lower than those required to produce vasoconstriction. Tetradecapeptide renin substrate was the least potent of the three peptides and had the slowest onset of action. Angiotensin II and angiotensin I each enhanced noradrenergic transmission to the same degree, whether perfused through the lumen or added to the adventitial surface of the artery. In contrast, tetradecapeptide renin substrate was more potent when applied to the adventitial surface. The effects of angiotensin I were blocked by the converting enzyme inhibitor enalaprilat, whereas the effects of tetradecapeptide renin substrate were unaltered by enalaprilat, or by the renin inhibitors pepstatin or a decapeptide renin inhibitor. These findings suggest that tetradecapeptide renin substrate and angiotensin I may be converted to angiotensin II within the rat caudal artery, with subsequent enhancement of noradrenergic neuroeffector function. However, the enzyme responsible for the conversion of tetradecapeptide renin substrate cannot be determined from the present findings.", 
    "176": "Plasma renin activity (PRA) is markedly increased by captopril. There is not enough separation between the changes in PRA of patients with renal artery stenosis (RAS) to separate them reliably from those with essential hypertension. A minimal response may suggest primary aldosteronism. Captopril does increase the ratio of PRA in the venous blood from a kidney with RAS to that of the contralateral kidney. Captopril, 25 to 50 mg orally, given before renal vein PRA sampling will increase the sensitivity and specificity of the test. Treatment with current antihypertensive drugs need not be discontinued. Scleroderma renal crisis (SRC) used to be uniformly lethal within a few months. Modern, aggressive antihypertensive therapy has made survival of 2 or more years common. Not all patients respond, and some progress to renal failure despite good BP control. Captopril has been used with success in some patients with idiopathic edema. In conclusion, captopril markedly enhances the accuracy of renal vein renin assay for the diagnosis of RAS and is of major value in the treatment of SRC.",

Rational therapy considers a variety of factors to obtain maximum efficacy, safety, tolerability, compliance, and neutralization of neural tone for the prevention of sudden death. The patient's age, gender, race, behavior profile, hemodynamic and neurohumoral status (plasma renin activity, norepinephrine/epinephrine ratio), and quality of life will help determine the choice of antihypertensive agent. Concomitant risk factors (smoking, obesity, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia), the presence of sequelae (left ventricular hypertrophy and/or failure, renal failure), and the existence of other disorders (mitral valve prolapse, depression, anxiety) must also be considered when initiating treatment. In addition, the cost of ancillary expenses (laboratory tests, hospitalizations, and emergency room visits) must be weighed against the potential benefits of therapy. Beta blockers are effective, well tolerated, and versatile for the treatment of concomitant cardiovascular disorders and as behavior modifiers. Calcium channel blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors also show promise and merit consideration as therapy for specific groups of hypertensive patients.",

Results showed that the relative importance of the three enzymes in the inactivation of the opioid peptide, whether it was [Met5]-enkephalin or [Met5]-enkephalin-Arg6, in guinea-pig ileum was significantly different from that in either mouse vas deferens or rat vas deferens. Additionally, the relative importance of the three enzymes in the preparation, whether it was guinea-pig ileum, mouse vas deferens or rat vas deferens, in the inactivation of [Met5]-enkephalin was significantly different from that of [Met5]-enkephalin-Arg6. The significance of the presence of plural inactivating-enzymes for opioid peptides was discussed.", 
    "180": "We have previously shown that the hypotensive action of angiotensin I (ANG I) converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors is temporally related to a long-lasting inhibition of kininase activity in the arterial wall. More recently, we showed that conversion of ANG I in the perfused mesenteric vascular bed was not inhibited by enalaprilat at concentrations above those which maximally inhibited kininase activity. The present study extends these observations to two other ACE inhibitors and to another vascular bed, the rat hindlimb preparation. Like enalaprilat, captopril (0.06-1.5 mumol/l) or teprotide (0.4-10 mumol/l) did not inhibit the conversion of ANG I in the perfused mesenteric bed, although the response to bradykinin was substantially potentiated, indicating that the ACE inhibitor decreased kininase activity. In the perfused hindlimb preparations, enalaprilat reduced kininase activity without altering the conversion of ANG I. Enalaprilat or captopril administered to rats caused a decrease in mean arterial blood pressure that lasted for over 24 h. In mesenteric preparations taken from animals 24 h after treatment with ACE inhibitors, kininase activity was inhibited whereas converting activity was unchanged. Therefore, the long-lasting hypotensive effect of ACE inhibition is apparently related to a prolonged inhibition of kininase activity in the arterial wall, which is believed to be the target for ACE inhibitor activity.", 
    "181": "We tested the hypothesis that a metabolic error may be the triggering mechanism which leads to blood-vessel hypertrophy and hypertension. Young spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were fed a moderately high salt diet to exacerbate the purported metabolic error. Haematocrit values and rubidium transport were measured as evidence of renal ATP deficiency and blood-vessel adaptation. The renin system was inhibited in two groups of SHR by giving them enalapril to determine whether angiotensin II was involved in blood-vessel adaptation. Spontaneously hypertensive rats fed the moderately high salt diet had higher haematocrit values than normotensive rats fed the same diet or SHR fed Purina rat food, suggesting a renal ATP deficiency. Spontaneously hypertensive rats had higher Na+,K+-ATPase activity in thoracic aorta after 60 min incubation than a similar group given enalapril (P less than 0.001), suggesting blood-vessel adaptation. Possibly, angiotensin II within the vasa vasorum stimulates hypertrophy which, according to the Folkow hypothesis, leads to higher blood pressure, but may concomitantly increase the respiratory chain units which provide ATP for renal function and ion transport.", 
    "182": "This study aimed to clarify whether or not captopril modifies the activity of an intrinsic, presynaptic, angiotensin II receptor system within the vasculature in superfused spiral preparations of guinea-pig pulmonary arteries preloaded with 3H-norepinephrine. Angiotensins I and II dose-dependently facilitated 3H efflux and contraction evoked by transmural field stimulation at 5 Hz. A conversion rate of angiotensin I to angiotensin II calculated from the dose-response curves was 26.7 +/- 2.6%. 1Sar-8Ile-angiotensin II alone did not decrease the evoked 3H efflux and contraction, but antagonized the facilitation induced by angiotensins I and II. Captopril (1 and 10 mumol) inhibited the facilitation by angiotensin I but produced no effect on that by angiotensin II. Captopril alone at 1 mumol attenuated the evoked 3H efflux and contraction without decreasing contractile responses to exogenously applied norepinephrine, but the higher concentrations produced no further dose-dependent attenuation. Indomethacin alone produced no increases in the evoked 3H efflux. Captopril at 1 mumol still attenuated the evoked 3H efflux in the presence of indomethacin. On the other hand, enalaprilat alone (0.1-100 mumol) produced no effect on the evoked 3H efflux and contraction. Thus, in guinea-pig pulmonary arteries, angiotensin I is intramurally converted to angiotensin II, and there are presynaptic angiotensin II receptors to facilitate norepinephrine release. However, captopril-induced presynaptic adrenergic transmission failure appears to be dependent neither on an intrinsic angiotensin system nor on a prostaglandin-related mechanism.",

Maximum reductions from baseline values of supine blood pressure in enalapril-treated (-25/-16 mm Hg) and metoprolol-treated (-21/-15 mm Hg) patients were observed after 12 weeks of single- or double-drug therapy. Approximately two-thirds of the patients responded to single-drug therapy; when hydrochlorothiazide was added, response rates increased to 88% of the patients treated with enalapril and 80% of the patients treated with metoprolol. Enalapril produced a consistently greater reduction in systolic blood pressure. Blacks had a significantly smaller mean blood pressure response to both enalapril and metoprolol than did nonblacks.

The vessels were isolated from the femoral bed and segments of the vessels were mounted on an isometric myograph. The vessels responded in a concentration-dependent manner to synthetic tetradecapeptide (TDP) renin substrate, angiotensin I (ANG I) and angiotensin II (ANG II), the responses to all these substances being inhibited by saralasin (0.1 mumol/l). The responses to ANG I, but not those to TDP renin substrate, were inhibited by captopril (1 mmol/l). In contrast, the non-specific protease inhibitor aprotinin had an inhibitory effect on responses to TDP renin substrate. The results suggest that TDP renin substrate is converted to ANG II by a process that does not involve metabolism of ANG I.",

    "188": "Thirty three reports of cough associated with captopril and 26 associated with enalapril received by the New Zealand intensive medicines monitoring programme were reviewed. The programme is a specialised part of the New Zealand postmarketing surveillance system. Review of these reports showed that the cough was an adverse reaction to the drugs, occurred even with low dose treatment, and was severe enough to warrant withdrawal of the drugs in most of the cases reported. A significant sex difference was shown, with women predominating. The reaction seemed to be a greater problem with enalapril, and in seven patients it occurred with both captopril and enalapril. Withdrawal of treatment resulted in rapid recovery, and no long term effects were shown. The pathogenesis of the reaction is unknown, but possible mediators include bradykinin and prostaglandins.", 
    "189": "Acute reversible renal failure with hyperkalemia developed in a 42-year-old woman during treatment of heart failure and hypertension with high doses of enalapril and diuretics. Creatinine clearance fell as low as 9 ml/min. Renal-artery stenosis and prerenal renal failure were excluded. Reduction in blood pressure in conjunction with reduced renal perfusion in heart failure can make glomerular filtration angiotensin dependent. Interruption of angiotensin II formation in this situation triggers off functional renal insufficiency.", 
    "190": "The effects of a long term reduction in blood pressure on the kidney function of normotensive diabetic patients who had persistent microalbuminuria (30-300 mg albumin/24 hours) were studied in two groups of 10 such patients before and during six months of treatment with either 20 mg enalapril or placebo daily. Treatments were assigned randomly in a double blind fashion. Before treatment both groups had similar clinical characteristics, weight, diet, total glycosylated haemoglobin, median albumin excretion rate (enalapril group 124 mg/24 h, placebo group 81 mg/24 h), and mean arterial pressure (enalapril group 100 (SD 8) mm Hg, placebo group 99 (6) mm Hg). During treatment weight, urinary urea excretion, and total glycosylated haemoglobin remained unchanged. The mean arterial pressure decreased in the enalapril group but not in the placebo group (enalapril group 90 (10) mm Hg, placebo group 98 (8) mm Hg). The median albumin excretion rate also fell in the enalapril group but not in the placebo group (enalapril group 37 mg/24 h, placebo group 183 mg/24 h.) The glomerular filtration rate rose in the enalapril group from 130 (23) ml/min/1.73 m2 to 141 (24) ml/min/1.73 m2, and total renal resistances and fractional albumin clearance decreased while fractional albumin clearance increased in the placebo group. These results show that in patients who have diabetes but not hypertension a reduction in blood pressure by inhibition of converting enzyme for six months can reduce persistent microalbuminuria, perhaps by decreasing the intraglomerular pressure.", 
    "191": "A sensitive method for the determination of captopril in blood and urine by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry is described. In order to prevent oxidative degradation of captopril, its sulph-hydryl group was immediately protected by treatment with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), and the resulting NEM adduct was then converted into the bis(pentafluorobenzyl) derivative. Derivatized captopril was separated on a 2% OV-1 column, exhibiting a single peak of the correct theoretical shape. The detection limit was estimated to be 100 pg by using S-benzylcaptopril as an internal standard. The blood level and urinary excretion of unchanged captopril orally administered to dogs were determined by the proposed method. In addition, epimerization of the proline moiety and formation of the sulphoxide or sulphone through the esterification step are also described.", 
    "192": "To evaluate the influence of the angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor enalapril (2.5 to 40 mg per day) on the prognosis of severe congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] functional class IV), we randomly assigned 253 patients in a double-blind study to receive either placebo (n = 126) or enalapril (n = 127). Conventional treatment for heart failure, including the use of other vasodilators, was continued in both groups. Follow-up averaged 188 days (range, 1 day to 20 months). The crude mortality at the end of six months (primary end point) was 26 percent in the enalapril group and 44 percent in the placebo group--a reduction of 40 percent (P = 0.002). Mortality was reduced by 31 percent at one year (P = 0.001). By the end of the study, there had been 68 deaths in the placebo group and 50 in the enalapril group--a reduction of 27 percent (P = 0.003). The entire reduction in total mortality was found to be among patients with progressive heart failure (a reduction of 50 percent), whereas no difference was seen in the incidence of sudden cardiac death. A significant improvement in NYHA classification was observed in the enalapril group, together with a reduction in heart size and a reduced requirement for other medication for heart failure. The overall withdrawal rate was similar in both groups, but hypotension requiring withdrawal occurred in seven patients in the enalapril group and in no patients in the placebo group. After the initial dose of enalapril was reduced to 2.5 mg daily in high-risk patients, this side effect was less frequent. We conclude that the addition of enalapril to conventional therapy in patients with severe congestive heart failure can reduce mortality and improve symptoms. The beneficial effect on mortality is due to a reduction in death from the progression of heart failure.", 
    "193": "After all previous antihypertensive treatment had been stopped, blood pressure and glucose tolerance were measured in 16 hypertensive non-insulin treated diabetics before and again six weeks after treatment with captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Supine blood pressure fell from 184 +/- 4.1/103 +/- 2.6 to 165 +/- 5.2/88 +/- 2.1 mmHg (P less than 0.001) and erect from 179 +/- 5.2/102 +/- 3.2 to 158 +/- 5.6/87 +/- 2.6 mmHg (P less than 0.005). The area under the oral glucose tolerance curve fell from 2313.6 +/- 154 to 2192.8 +/- 146 mmol/min/l (P less than 0.02). There was no change in plasma insulin, total glycosylated haemoglobin or fructosamine. Four patients who failed to show lowering of supine diastolic pressure below 95 mmHg were additionally given oral frusemide with further improvement in blood pressure and no alteration in carbohydrate intolerance. It was concluded that captopril alone is usually an effective antihypertensive agent in non-insulin dependent diabetes with the addition of frusemide benefiting resistant cases. Glucose intolerance did not worsen with either captopril alone or captopril plus frusemide.", 
    "194": "Renin- and nonrenin-mediated antihypertensive actions of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors were investigated in young spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Renin was suppressed either by removal of 2/3 of the renal mass, deoxycorticosterone (DOC) treatment, or 1% of NaCl in drinking water. Blood pressure responses to the nonsulfhydryl ACE inhibitor quinapril (CI-906) and the sulfhydryl inhibitor captopril, given orally for 2 days each, were examined by the tail cuff method. The marked depressor responses observed in control SHR were attenuated by the different manipulations in a manner clearly related to suppression of plasma renin activity (PRA). The decrease in blood pressure falls and in PRA was smallest in partially nephrectomized SHR. The mineralocorticoid (DOC) administration or 1% NaCl reduced PRA and the responses to ACE inhibitors markedly, though not completely. In a further experiment, severe salt retention induced by DOC and NaCl in uninephrectomized SHR suppressed PRA to an unmeasurable level and prevented the depressor action of a large dose of captopril. The results suggest that in SHR the acute blood pressure-lowering effect of ACE inhibitors is completely dependent on the renin-angiotensin system. The experiments also show that this system clearly participates in the support of rapidly increasing blood pressure in young SHR.",

    "196": "Blockade of angiotensin-converting enzyme has been variously reported to increase or to decrease sodium excretion in patients with cirrhosis and ascites. We administered captopril (50-150 mg) to 11 patients with cirrhosis and ascites to determine the effects on blood pressure, renal blood flow and sodium excretion. Plasma renin activity increased and mean blood pressure fell (by 14 mm Hg). Para-aminohippurate clearances increased from 321 +/- 53 to 559 +/- 83 ml/min (P less than 0.005), but inulin clearances were minimally altered (73 +/- 8 to 76 +/- 7 ml/min), suggesting preferential dilation of glomerular efferent arterioles. Despite unchanged glomerular delivery of sodium, urinary sodium excretion fell in all subjects (from 2.70 +/- 1.00 to 0.48 +/- 0.21 mEq/h), urinary volume was reduced (377 +/- 55 to 182 +/- 42 ml/h, P less than 0.005), and the natriuretic effect of furosemide was blunted. The antinatriuretic effect of captopril may be mediated by reduced angiotensin II-mediated sodium excretion, by decreased prostaglandin production, and/or by indirect effects of reduced blood pressure. Captopril impairs rather than promotes sodium excretion.", 
    "197": "The effects of captopril on cardiovascular dynamics and left ventricular (LV) contractility were studied in 11 patients with severe congestive heart failure and very poor global LV function. Pressures were measured using a flow-guided catheter, cardiac output by thermodilution, and LV contraction and ejection fraction by simultaneous radionuclide angiography. Ventricular loading conditions were altered by sublingual isosorbide dinitrate to facilitate construction of LV pressure-volume and stress-shortening curves. Captopril decreased mean arterial pressure (p less than 0.02) and systemic vascular resistance, while stroke and cardiac index increased in most patients. Left ventricular ejection fraction increased from 18 +/- 5 to 22 +/- 7% (p less than 0.05), but contractility, assessed from end-systolic pressure-volume and end-systolic pressure-shortening relations, was unchanged or decreased slightly. Heart rate and double product also tended to decrease. In contrast, arteriovenous oxygen difference widened and calculated total oxygen consumption increased during captopril therapy (p less than 0.05). The study showed that captopril improved forward blood flow, total oxygen extraction, and LV ejection fraction following the decrease impedance to LV emptying but not at the expense of an increase in ventricular contractility. This makes captopril an attractive drug for patients with end-stage cardiac failure and a severely damaged myocardium.", 
    "198": "Captopril (10(-6) g/ml) enhanced and prolonged the inhibitory effect of leu- and met-enkephalins on the contractions of the isolated guinea-pig ileum section induced by electrical stimulation. In mice, the drug (25 mg/kg, subcutaneously) increased the degree and duration of the analgetic effect of enkephalins. It is concluded that the analgetic effect of captopril is related to the influence on the activity of the endogenous antinociceptive system.", 
    "199": "The effects of the addition of a calcium entry antagonist, nifedipine (20-mg tablet twice a day), to an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril (25 mg three times a day), and the addition of captopril to nifedipine were observed in two separate studies in patients with essential hypertension. After 4 weeks of captopril therapy alone, mean arterial pressure fell by 12 mm Hg, and with the addition of nifedipine to captopril for a further month, blood pressure fell by an additional 10 mm Hg. In a separate group of patients treated with the same doses, mean arterial pressure fell by 17 mm Hg with nifedipine treatment alone; when captopril was added to the nifedipine therapy for an additional month, mean arterial pressure fell by a further 11 mm Hg. These blood pressures were measured 2 hours after the last dose; however, there was less of a fall in blood pressure when it was measured 12 hours after the last dose. This study confirms that captopril and nifedipine have a marked additive effect on blood pressure in whichever order they are given, but it shows that the combination is relatively short-acting.", 
    "200": "The suggestion has been made that the Okamoto strain of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) shares some features with a subgroup of patients with essential hypertension, called nonmodulators. One feature of nonmodulators is a renal blood flow response to angiotensin II (ANG II) that is blunted on a high salt diet; the blunted renal vascular response is corrected by converting enzyme inhibition. Renal blood flow (electromagnetic flowmeter) and pressor responses to graded ANG II doses (5-300 ng) were assessed in 24 SHR and 24 Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) ingesting 1.6% Na. In comparison to WKY, blood pressure was higher in SHR (155 +/- 4 vs 106 +/- 2 mm Hg; p less than 0.001), renal blood flow was lower (6.9 +/- 0.5 vs 8.2 +/- 0.4 ml/min/g; p less than 0.05), and the pressor response to ANG II was enhanced, (p less than 0.0005) but the renal vascular response was blunted (p less than 0.005). Captopril (1-30 mg/kg) reduced blood pressure more in SHR than in WKY but increased renal blood flow similarly in both strains. The blunted renal vascular response to ANG II in SHR was reversed by captopril, but inhibition of converting enzyme in the kidney did not parallel systemic inhibition. Maximum blockade of converting enzyme in the kidney appears to require a larger captopril dose than is required for systemic inhibition. These results suggest that the renal blood supply in SHR also shares some of the characteristics of nonmodulators and that the action of captopril on the renal blood flow probably reflects reversal of inappropriate intrarenal ANG II formation.", 
    "201": "The purpose of study was to investigate the role of angiotensin II in idiopathic primary aldosteronism (IPA) and to evaluate the interest of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) in its management. The study concerned 10 hypertensive patients, mean 49 +/- 11 years with idiopathic primary aldosteronism due to bilateral adrenal hyperplasia: plasma renin activity (PRA) less than 1.5 ng/ml/h and plasma aldosterone (PA) greater than 25 ng/100 ml. Adrenal venography and adrenal vein aldosterone levels demonstrated bilateral hyperplasia. PRA and PA were evaluated in recumbent position, then after 4 hours in upright posture. The next day, a \"captopril screening test\" was performed with PA assays before and three hours after a single oral administration of captopril (1 mg/kg). Upright PRA and PA were slightly increased and acute administration of captopril reduced significantly PA levels in all patients. Blood pressure (BP was unmodified under captopril. These hormonal results demonstrated that adrenal glomerulosa remained sensitive to low concentrations of angiotensin II, and underlined the potential interest of ACEI in the management of IPA. Brown R. demonstrated already an increase of adrenal sensitivity to angiotensin II infusions, and isolated an aldosterone-stimulating factor (ASF). Plasma aldosterone levels were related to increased ASF concentrations but there was no link between PRA and ASF. Carey R. suggested that ASF acts through an increase of the sensitivity of aldosterone production to angiotensin II.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "202": "Deterioration of renal function may be elicited by converting enzyme inhibition (CEI) in patients with bilateral (BI) or solitary kidney (SK) renal artery stenosis, but the determinants of this complication are not clearly delimited. The effect of acute administration of captopril on arterial pressure, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow was assessed in 10 BI and 10 SK hypertensive patients with a mean GFR of 64 +/- 5 ml/min. CEI induced a decrease in MAP of 8 +/- 2 p. 100 and a fall in GFR of 25 +/- 8 p. 100; GFR fell by more than 20 p. 100 in 5/10 BI and 8/10 SK. Filtration fraction (FF) decreased by 16 +/- 5 p. 100. CEI-induced change in GFR was not related to the change in MAP, but was inversely correlated with pre-C FF; GFR always fell when FF was higher than 0.28. Surgical correction of the stenosis suppressed the C-induced decrease in GFR in 5 SK patients in whom it initially fell. In conclusion, basal FF, a probable index of intrarenal angiotensin II activity, rather than a fall in systemic blood pressure, is the main predictor of acute deterioration of renal function after converting enzyme inhibition.", 
    "203": "In order to show in SHR to what extent the kidneys excrete salt and water in proper relation to intake and whether antihypertensive action of converting enzyme inhibition (CEI) involves changes in salt--and water--balance, metabolic studies were conducted during 12 weeks following weaning (wk 4 to 15) on 4 groups of 9 male rats: SHR, WKY and SHR.C, WKY.C (C: given 30 mg captopril/kg body wt every 12 hr by gavage), all fed a standard rat chow (sodium 104 +/- 3 meq/g) in metabolic cages with free access to distilled water. SHR exhibited a higher weekly sodium retention than WKY only up to the end of wk 9 (5.2 +/- 0.5 vs 3.4 +/- 0.6 mEq/wk, p less than 0.001). This was due to lower urinary excretion and greater intakes since fecal losses were higher. From ages 10 through 15 wk, weekly sodium retention was the same in both strains although urinary sodium excretion in SHR was still significantly lower. SHR also retained more water at 7 and 8 wk than age-matched WKY due to lower urinary excretion. From ages 4 to 15 wk, SHR exhibited a reduced relationship of urinary sodium and water excretion to systolic arterial pressure. From ages 4 to 15 wk, weekly sodium retention in SHR.C (2.9 +/- 0.9 mEq/wk) was below that in SHR (4.5 +/- 0.9 mEq/wk, p less than 0.05) and not different from that in WKY (3.7 +/- 0.8 mEq/wk). As intakes and fecal losses were unchanged by CEI, this was due to increased urinary sodium excretion in SHR.C over that in SHR (by 1.4 +/- 0.5 mEq/wk.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "204": "We examined whether vasopressin and/or sympathetic vasoconstrictor mechanisms constitute the efferent limb of an afferent renal nerve (ARN)-dependent renal pressor \"reflex\" produced by acute unilateral renal artery stenosis (RST). Rats that had received sinoaortic denervation (SAD) were implanted with right renal artery occluders and flow probes. After recovery, conscious rats received captopril. Acute RST increased arterial pressure (AP) by 25% and mesenteric and hindquarters resistances by 35 and 51%, respectively. Vasopressin receptor antagonism was without effect on the reflex. Ganglionic blockade (chlorisondamine or trimethaphan) abolished the reflex, as did alfaxalone/alfadolone or urethan-chloralose anesthesia. In an additional study, SAD animals were prepared with chronic T6 spinal cord transection. Increases in AP during RST were unaffected by spinal transection (27 +/- 4 mmHg). However, the increase in hindquarter resistance in the sham-transected animals (57 +/- 12%) was markedly attenuated (19 +/- 4%) in the spinal-transected group. The data suggest that in animals with depressed baroreflexes and renin-angiotensin system responsiveness, acute RST initiates an ARN-dependent pressor reflex with vasoconstrictor nerves comprising the efferent limb of the reflex. The reflex can be integrated at the spinal level and is highly sensitive to anesthesia.", 
    "205": "Angiotensin I analogues with a phosphonic acid group replacing the C-terminal carboxyl group were shown to be competitive inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme. This new class of inhibitors was used to study the binding requirements of the angiotensin I-like ligands to the enzyme's active site. These studies indicate that angiotensin-converting enzyme recognizes at least five amino acid residues at the C-terminus of the peptide. The effect of pH on the binding of the most potent inhibitor peptide was compared to Captopril. The two inhibitors showed similar Ki-pH profiles despite their structural differences. Chloride enhanced the binding of the peptide inhibitor at both pH 9.0 and pH 6.5. At pH 9.0 the inhibitor peptide and the anion bind randomly to the enzyme, while at pH 6.5 the mechanism is ordered. In the latter case, the anion binds first to the enzyme.", 
    "206": "Thirteen subjects with documented renovascular hypertension receiving chronic (greater than 1 month) therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril or captopril) underwent total and split renal function studies. Total glomerular filtration rate as assessed by inulin clearance was similar to that determined by radionuclide technique. Total effective renal plasma flow as assessed by p-aminohippurate clearance was lower than that determined by radionuclide technique. The glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow assessed by radionuclide technique of the stenotic kidney was comparatively lower than that of the non-stenotic kidney. No subject demonstrated complete loss of filtration or perfusion of the stenotic kidney. Five of six patients studied prospectively for 2 years have demonstrated stability of total renal function; the sixth patient, having a functional solitary stenotic kidney, has demonstrated stability of function following an initial abrupt decline in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow. These results suggest that chronic angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition therapy is not generally associated with near total absence of filtration of the stenotic kidney as has been suggested previously. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may be safely and effectively utilized in the treatment of renovascular hypertension.", 
    "207": "Diabetes mellitus is frequently accompanied by specific abnormalities of the renin-angiotensin system, but it is not known whether these alterations modify the response to converting enzyme inhibition. To evaluate this possibility, 129 patients with severe chronic heart failure were treated with captopril or enalapril for one to three months, while doses of digoxin and diuretics were kept constant; 35 patients had diabetes mellitus. Prior to therapy, diabetic patients had lower plasma renin activity (3.4 +/- 0.5 versus 7.0 +/- 1.1 ng/ml/hour) than did nondiabetic control subjects (p less than 0.05); yet the initial hemodynamic response to captopril was similar in both groups. Plasma renin activity predicted the hypotensive response to the first dose of captopril in nondiabetic control subjects (r = 0.70, p less than 0.001) but not in diabetic patients (r = 0.29). During long-term treatment with captopril or enalapril, both diabetic and nondiabetic patients had similar increases in cardiac index and decreases in mean arterial pressure and systemic vascular resistance. Diabetic patients, however, showed larger reductions in left ventricular filling pressure (-13.8 versus -9.1 mm Hg, p less than 0.02) and mean right atrial pressure (-6.2 versus -3.9 mm Hg, p less than 0.05) than did nondiabetic subjects; this was accompanied by a notable decline in body weight in diabetic patients only. Renal function remained unaltered during converting enzyme inhibition in nondiabetic patients, but deteriorated significantly in diabetic patients, as reflected by a marked increase in serum creatinine concentration (1.7 +/- 0.1 to 2.1 +/- 0.1 mg/dl, p less than 0.001). In conclusion, despite lower pretreatment plasma renin activity, diabetic patients with severe chronic heart failure demonstrated improvement during long-term converting enzyme inhibition to a degree similar to (if not greater than) that seen in nondiabetic control subjects, but were more susceptible to the development of functional renal insufficiency than their nondiabetic counterparts. These differences are explicable by abnormalities of renin/aldosterone synthesis and angiotensin-mediated vasoregulation that are known to be present in the diabetic state.", 
    "208": "The relationship between plasma angiotensin and the reduction of blood pressure with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril was studied in rats. Blood pressure was measured in conscious rats with indwelling arterial catheters. To measure angiotensin II, plasma was analyzed by physical separation of angiotensins using high performance liquid chromatography followed by radioimmunoassay. The effects of both single (acute) and long-term (chronic) dosages of enalapril were measured. After a single oral dose of enalapril (10 mg/kg), mean arterial pressure fell from 111 +/- 3 to 86 +/- 3 mm Hg (p less than 0.005). Despite the blood pressure reduction, plasma angiotensin II was unaffected (control, 9.9 +/- 1.8 vs 9.7 +/- 1.1 pg/ml). After a higher single oral dose of enalapril (30 mg/kg), there was a reduction in both mean arterial pressure (81 +/- 5 mm Hg, p less than 0.005) and plasma angiotensin II concentration (2.3 +/- 0.6 pg/ml, p less than 0.01). The chronic effects of converting enzyme inhibition were evaluated in rats given enalapril in their drinking water (30 mg/kg 24 hr) for 1 week or 2 months. Mean arterial pressure remained equally low after chronic administration (for 1 week or 2 months), but plasma angiotensin II increased above normal (after 1 week, 28.9 +/- 8.7, p less than 0.01 vs control; after 2 months, 43.1 +/- 16.2 pg/ml, p less than 0.05 vs control). Although plasma angiotensin converting enzyme activity was undetectable at any time after enalapril administration, there was a partial return of the angiotensin I pressor response with chronic administration. The data are most compatible with actions of converting enzyme inhibitors independent of the blockade of plasma angiotensin II formation.", 
    "209": "Experiments were conducted in two-kidney, one-clip renal vascular hypertensive rats (GHR) to assess the responses of each kidney to acute treatment with the antihypertensive calcium channel blocking agent verapamil in the presence and in the absence of converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI). One group of GHR (0.2 mm inner diam. clip 3 weeks before study) were examined during a control period, and during a second period of infusion of verapamil (600 micrograms h-1 kg-1). A second group of GHR were examined during a control period, during CEI (teprotide, 3 mg h-1 kg-1) infusion and during a third period of verapamil (600 micrograms h-1 kg-1) infusion superimposed on CEI infusion. Although systemic blood pressure (BP) decreased from 175 +/- 4 to 149 +/- 5 mmHg (mean +/- SEM) in response to verapamil alone, renal blood flow for non-clipped kidneys increased from 5.9 +/- 0.4 to 6.5 +/- 0.3 ml/min, indicating a 30% reduction of renal vascular resistance (P values less than or equal to 0.01; n = 9). Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) for non-clipped kidneys (n = 24) increased from 0.91 +/- 0.09 to 1.47 +/- 0.14 ml/min and filtration fraction increased from 0.32 +/- 0.04 to 0.47 +/- 0.03 (P values less than or equal to 0.05). Urine flow rate and absolute and fractional sodium excretion for non-clipped kidneys increased. GFR for clipped kidneys decreased during verapamil. Treatment with CEI alone resulted in nearly identical responses of BP and function of the non-clipped kidney, except filtration fraction was unchanged. The addition of verapamil to ongoing converting enzyme blockade tended to augment the increased GFR of the non-clipped kidney. Plasma renin activity (PRA) increased from 30 +/- 3 to 59 +/- 7 ng of angiotensin (ANG) I h-1 ml-1 with verapamil alone, a significantly larger increment than the increase of PRA from 27 +/- 5 to 39 +/- 9 ng of ANG I h-1 ml-1 in GHR subjected to comparable blood pressure reduction by mechanical aortic constriction. Verapamil resulted in many similar effects on renal function to those observed during blockade of converting enzyme. The increased filtration fraction observed in response to verapamil may be the result of vasodilatation of the afferent arteriole or of an increase in the glomerular ultrafiltration coefficient.", 
    "210": "In previous studies it has not been possible to determine net intrarenal formation of angiotensin II (ANG II) from arteriovenous ANG II concentrations because of the high intrarenal ANG II degradation rates (DR). This study was designed to determine ANG II-DR and to estimate net intrarenal ANG II formation during normal and enhanced renin secretion rate (RSR). In anesthetized dogs, plasma renin activity and ANG II were measured in arterial and renal venous blood by radioimmunoassay during four periods: control, renal arterial constriction (RAC), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition (MK 422), and MK 422 plus systemic arterial ANG II infusion. ANG II-DR was determined in each dog from the arterial-renal venous ANG II concentration difference during the period of ANG II infusion in the presence of ACE inhibition; this value was used to estimate net ANG II formation by predicting the amount of arterially delivered ANG II that escaped degradation. The average percent ANG II-DR calculated during ANG II infusion (range of 0.05 to 0.20 microgram/min) was 89 +/- 2%. In response to RAC, RSR increased from 11 +/- 3 to 24 +/- 5 ng ANG I X h-1 X min-1 X g-1. Arterial ANG II (67 +/- 11 pg/ml) and renal venous ANG II (29 +/- 6 pg/ml) increased to 133 +/- 18 and 61 +/- 10 pg/ml, respectively. Net intrarenal ANG II formation increased from 44 +/- 11 to 83 +/- 13 pg X min-1 X g-1 after renal arterial constriction. There was a significant relationship between the change in RSR and the change in ANG II formation rate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Understanding of both the basic pathophysiology and the design of rational and effective treatment of this syndrome has increased dramatically in the last ten years. However, congestive heart failure remains a highly lethal disease, which kills at a rate exceeding that of most cancers. Prevention is therefore of the utmost importance and has to come primarily from a reduction in the incidence and damage done from myocardial infarction. Improved understanding of the pathophysiology of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy is also needed. Through understanding of pathophysiologic principles, effective therapy based on interference with known mechanisms that are operative in the disease is now available but can be refined in the future.",

    "213": "The effects of interaction between endothelial angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and goat anti-rabbit ACE (GtARbACE) antibodies were studied in rabbit glomeruli. By immunofluorescence ACE was not detectable in normal glomeruli. However, when kidneys were perfused with GtARbACE antibodies glomerular bound IgG was seven times higher than that of non-immune IgG and granular deposits of goat IgG were found on the endothelium of glomeruli and arteries. Rabbits injected intravenous for 4 d with GtARbACE antibodies showed on day 1 granular deposits of goat IgG on the glomerular endothelium; from day 3 to 24 there was gradual development of subepithelial deposits of goat IgG, rabbit IgG and C3. When GtARbACE antibodies were similarly injected into proteinuric rabbits there was formation of subepithelial granular deposits of goat IgG and ACE. The results document that a glomerular endothelial antigen is redistributed in vivo by a specific ligand, an event associated with formation of immune deposits. Furthermore, if the glomerular permeability is artificially increased, immune complexes shed from nonglomerular endothelia into the circulation can contribute to form subepithelial immune deposits.",

Data on their use specifically in elderly hypertensives, however, are limited. Addressed in this review of the available literature are the questions whether they are effective hypotensives in the elderly, whether their effects are age-related, and what effects, if any, do they have on morbidity and mortality in geriatric hypertension.", 
    "215": "Cilazapril is a new angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. In a double-blind crossover study six normal male volunteers received single oral doses of cilazapril, 4 mg, captopril, 25 mg, enalapril, 10 mg, and placebo. The response of diastolic blood pressure to an intravenous infusion with increasing doses of angiotensin I (AT-I) (0.1 to 18 micrograms/min) was determined at control and up to 36 hours after oral drug intake. Additionally the response to AT-I was established before, during, and after cessation of a 15-day 2.5 mg/day cilazapril administration. The ACE inhibitors antagonized the AT-I effects and shifted the AT-I dose-effect curves rightward, whereas placebo was not effective. After single doses the effects of cilazapril and enalapril declined with a similar elimination half-life of approximately 4 hours; with captopril approximately 2 hours was observed. After multiple administration of cilazapril there was no evidence of cumulative effects. Cilazapril is an orally active ACE inhibitor that does not show pharmacodynamically relevant accumulation.", 
    "216": "Enalapril clearance after single doses is reduced in the elderly. The influence of age on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of chronic enalapril treatment was examined in six young (22 to 31 years) and six elderly (65 to 78 years) healthy subjects who took enalapril, 10 mg, daily for 8 days. The blood pressure fall was greater in the elderly even with chronic administration. Plasma angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition was similar in both groups. Steady-state serum enalaprilat concentrations were achieved more slowly in the elderly subjects and were correspondingly higher for all subjects. Clearance/bioavailability and volume of distribution/bioavailability diminished with repeated administration. Repeated exposure also led to a reduction in sensitivity of plasma angiotensin-converting enzyme to the inhibitor. Prolonged inhibition probably induces synthesis of new angiotensin-converting enzyme.", 
    "217": "To test the hypothesis that angiotensin II could be a mediator of acute lung injury, we studied the effects of perindopril diacid, a new angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, on hemodynamics, blood gases, lung mechanics, and extravascular lung water (EVLW). Twenty-four dogs were anesthetized, paralyzed and ventilated with a fraction of inspired oxygen of 0.4 in which pulmonary edema was induced by 0.1 ml/kg iv oleic acid. Perindopril diacid (1 mg/kg) was administered iv either before (eight dogs) or 100 min after (eight dogs) oleic acid injection. In the control group (eight dogs) not treated with perindopril diacid, 150 min after oleic acid injection, PaO2 changed from 193 +/- 7 (mean +/- SEM) to 55 +/- 4 torr, venous admixture from 3 +/- 1% to 52 +/- 5%, cardiac index from 4.1 +/- 0.3 to 3.1 +/- 0.3 L/min X m2, mean pulmonary artery pressure from 13 +/- 1 to 17 +/- 1 mm Hg, dynamic compliance from 90 +/- 8 to 46 +/- 7 ml/cm H2O, and EVLW from 165 +/- 25 to 750 +/- 92 ml/m2. Administration of perindopril diacid reduced systemic BP by 20% but did not affect other hemodynamic variables, blood gases, or dynamic compliance. Maximum increases in EVLW were from 169 +/- 16 to 615 +/- 54 ml/m2 in the pretreated group and from 188 +/- 23 to 675 +/- 56 ml/m2 in the treated group (no significant difference from the control group). However, pretreatment with perindopril diacid significantly (p less than .05) slowed the rise in EVLW, which was lower 60 and 90 min after oleic acid injection compared to untreated dogs. Plasma renin activity and angiotensin I concentration increased after oleic acid injection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "218": "The interaction between atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) system was studied in 6 healthy volunteers using the angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, captopril. Each volunteer received, on separate occasions in random order, 48 hours treatment with a) low-dose captopril (6.25 mg twice daily), b) 'high-dose' captopril (25 mg twice daily) and c) placebo prior to an infusion of synthetic human ANP (99-126). Resting plasma ANP levels were significantly (P less than 0.01) higher on treatment with 'high-dose' captopril when compared with low-dose captopril or placebo. 'High-dose' captopril reduced mean arterial blood pressure (BP) and significantly (P less than 0.01) reduced the natriuretic response to the human ANP infusion. These results support the hypothesis that ACE is involved in ANP metabolism. The reduced renal response to ANP during treatment with captopril may reflect the dependence of ANP on adequate renal perfusion pressure and angiotensin II levels to exert its natriuretic effect.",

Average captopril dosage was 265 mg/d (150-300 mg), average minoxidil dosage was 19.6 mg/d (7.5-30 mg), dosages of Furosemide, Spironolactone and Metroprolol were similar in the two groups. Blood pressure decreased dramatically with both regimens (208/130 to 148/96 with captopril, 194/115 to 154/100 with minoxidil). Sokolow index was at the upper range of normal and decreased with both drugs. Cardiothoracic ratio decreased only with captopril. Echocardiograms were performed and read blindly at the end of the study. LV mass was measured according to Devereux, method. All patients had severe LVH. After 6 months posterior wall thickness decreased from 14.8 to 13.8 mm with captopril, remained stable from 14.1 to 14.9 mm with minoxidil, septal thickness decreased from 17.2 to 15.7 mm with captopril and remained stable (14.8 to 15.2 mm) with minoxidil. LV mass and mass index respectively decreased from 456 g and 232 g/m2 to 372 g and 190 g/m2 with captopril, and remained unchanged from 413 g and 215 g/m2 to 420 g and 218 g/m2 with minoxidil.

Sham operated rats (G1) and half of hypertensive rats (G2) were studied after 8 weeks. The other half of 8 weeks long hypertensive rats (G3) were treated during 8 weeks with Perindopril in drinking water at a dosage adjusted to maintain blood pressure (BP) measured with tail cuff method under 140 mmHg. The study of each rat included 1) coronary blood flow and resistance measurements under resting conditions and after coronary dilation by carbochrome infusion (9 mg/kg) using left atrial injection of radioactive microspheres (method of Wicker and Tarazi) 2) the study of mechanical performance of the isolated papillary muscle 3) weight of left ventricle after separation of septum and free wall whose subendocardial and subepicardial layers were counted separately. Results (mean +/- SD): (table; see text) MAP: mean pressure. LV/BW: left ventricular mass (mg) per gram of body weight; CR (C): minimal coronary resistance after carbochrome (mmHg/ml/min/100 mg); DL/Dt: peak velocity of shortening at L max preload; Vrelax: peak velocity of relaxation; THR: time of half relaxation; p less than 0.05; p less than 0.01 compared to SHAM. In this model, hypertension induced a 50 p. 100 LVH whose regression was nearly complete after 8 weeks of treatment with Perindopril.

    "221": "The influence of a new ACEI, Ramipril (R) on renal handling of UA was investigated. 13 hypertensives with normal renal function received either R (10 mg p.o.) or placebo (P). Arterial pressure (AP), GFR (Inulin clearance), Renal Plasma Flow (RPF, PAH clearance), UA urinary excretion (UAV) and fractional clearance (FeAU: UA clearance/GFR) were studied for seven hours after drug administration. GFR remained stable in all cases. R had no effect on sodium excretion rate. Compared to P, R significantly increased UAV by 25 p. 100, FeAU by 32 p. 100, RPF by 26.5 p. 100 and decreased mean arterial pressure (MAP) by 10 p. 100. ACE activity was maximally suppressed at 2 hours. More than 80 p. 100 of the maximal changes in UAU and FeAU were observed within the first two hours, while a progressive increase in RPF up to the fifth hour, and a progressive fall in MAP up to the fourth hour was evident. Except for PAM, all these changes were still present at the end of the study (seventh hour). In conclusion, Ramipril increases the fractional excretion of uric acid. This effect is observed independently of any change in sodium balance and preceeds by two to three hours the changes in renal hemodynamics. The simultaneous changes in FeAU and in ACE activity indicate that the effect on uric acid excretion is presumably due to the fall in angiotensin concentration.", 
    "222": "On the isolated perfused rat kidney, angiotensin-converting-enzyme activity was evaluated by two approaches: one, biochemical, through the measurements of the enzymatic activity on renal homogenate, the other, pharmacological, through the vasoconstrictor response to angiotensin I. Renal tissue angiotensin-converting-enzyme activity was not modified by setting the kidney under perfusion with a modified Krebs-Henseleit solution but was inhibited after addition of captopril into the perfusion medium (10(-5) M, 100 p. 100 inhibition) or after pretreatment of the animals with ramipril (10 mg/kg/day over 3 weeks, per os, 60 p. 100 inhibition). On the isolated perfused rat kidney, angiotensin I and angiotensin II induced a concentration dependent renal vasoconstriction (EC50 = 1.05 +/- 0.18 X 10(-8) and 0.11 +/- 0.05 X 10(-8) M) which was competitively antagonized by saralasin, an angiotensin II receptor antagonist. Addition of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors to the perfusion medium (captopril or ramiprilat, 10(-5) M) or pretreatment of the animals with ramipril (50 mg/kg, i.p. the day before or 10 mg/kg/day over 3 weeks, per os) only shifted the angiotensin I concentration-response curve to the right by a factor 3 to 4. The residual vasoconstrictor effect of angiotensin I was abolished by 10(-5) M saralasin and remains linked to a local generation of angiotensin II. Our results suggest that, on the isolated perfused rat kidney, besides the angiotensin-converting-enzyme, an iso-enzyme may also be able to generate angiotensin II.", 
    "223": "Two hundred and one patients with essential hypertension, whose supine diastolic blood pressure (SDBP) was greater than or equal to 95 mmHg following 2 weeks of treatment with the optimal dose of a beta blocker-diuretic combination (Phase 1), were randomly assigned to the addition of either 25 or 50 mg captopril BID for 6 weeks (Phase 2). At the end of Phase 2, the dose of captopril was doubled in the patients not normalized (SDBP greater than or equal to 95 mmHg) and maintained in the others (SDBP less than 95) for an additional 4 weeks (Phase 3). At the end of Phase 3, the beta blocker was withdrawn in the normalized (SDBP less than 95 mmHg) patients, and captopril plus diuretic was given for 4 weeks (Phase 4). The addition of captopril at either dose level led to a significant fall (p less than 0.01) in standing and supine diastolic and systolic blood pressure after the first 2 weeks of treatment. There was no significant difference in response between the two dose levels of captopril. At the end of Phase 2, 59.4% and 55.8% of patients, respectively, assigned to 25 and 50 mg captopril BID, were normalized. Doubling the dose of captopril (Phase 3) led to approximately an additional 30% of patients being normalized. At the end of Phase 4 (captopril plus diuretic) the SDBP was still less than 95 mmHg in 63% of patients, whereas it was increased in the others. Side effects were noted in 10 patients (5%). The incidence was similar in each treatment group, and a total of four patients (2%) were withdrawn due to side effects.", 
    "224": "Whether or not the kidney is involved in the genesis of hypertension in an individual patient, it becomes a major determinant of the response to antihypertensive therapy once a treatment strategy is adopted. The major mechanisms through which the kidney influences blood pressure are renin release and sodium retention, either together or separately, but additional mechanisms may also contribute. When sodium intake is restricted or a diuretic is used, the reactive increase in plasma renin activity makes a substantial contribution to limiting the decrease in blood pressure. When vasodilators or agents that block the sympathetic nervous system are used, sodium retention plays an important role. Among newer agents, the effectiveness of calcium-channel blockers, converting-enzyme inhibitors, and perhaps dopamine analogs reflects, for reasons that differ from one class of agent to another, a special action on the kidney that limits the reactive renal response to the reduction in blood pressure. Treatment strategies that address the problem of the renal response are more likely to be effective than approaches that avoid or ignore it.",

    "227": "We have studied the attenuation by captopril of sympathetic neurotransmission in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Captopril (4 mg/kg for 15-17 days or 20 mg/kg for 4 days) was delivered i.v. by osmotic minipump. The higher dose lowered blood pressure, the lower dose did not. Both doses inhibited converting enzyme activity. In the pithed rat, both doses attenuated responses to exogenous noradrenaline and sympathetic nerve stimulation. In isolated tail arteries removed from captopril-treated rats, responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation and exogenous noradrenaline were the same as in controls. Perfusion of the tail artery of control rats with captopril, angiotensin I or angiotensin II had no effect on basal perfusion pressure or on vasoconstriction induced by exogenous noradrenaline or sympathetic nerve stimulation. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that: 1. the attenuation of sympathetic neurotransmission by captopril depends upon the presence of an intact renin-angiotensin system, and 2. captopril has no direct postsynaptic effect in the isolated tail artery preparation.", 
    "228": "Inhibitors of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) acutely increase sodium excretion. Whether or not continued treatment induces net negative sodium balance is not clear, and may depend on initial sodium balance. We therefore investigated the effects of 8 days of treatment with enalapril, 10 mg b.i.d., on sodium balance in 10 subjects with uncomplicated essential hypertension, in balance on a low (50 mmol sodium/24 h) and a liberal (200 mmol sodium/24 h) sodium intake. Sodium excretion exceeded intake during the first days of treatment, amounting to sodium losses of 101 +/- 24 and 112 +/- 15 mmol in the low and the liberal sodium diets, respectively. The sodium loss was accompanied by a fall in body weight with both regimens. The blood pressure response to enalapril was potentiated by the sodium-restricted diet. The net increase in sodium excretion after enalapril administration, however, was similar for both diets. This was particularly true for individual patients, suggesting an individual response pattern to ACE inhibition.",

Oral E and intravenous E had similar onsets of action. The maximal reduction following oral LI (-19 +/- 13 mm Hg at 210 min) was similar to oral E and intravenous E. The effect of intravenous LI (-25 +/- 9 mm Hg at 105 min) was similar to that of intravenous ET.

MK351A, tyrosyl derivative of enalaprilic acid was iodinated with 125I and used as the radioligand. [125I]MK351A bound to human serum ACE in a concentration-dependent manner. It was displaced in a concentration-dependent manner by all ACE inhibitors tested. Fifty percent displacement of bound [125I]MK351A (DD50) for each ACE inhibitor correlated well with inhibitor potency ID50, estimated using an ACE enzymatic activity assay using Hip-His-Leu as substrate (r = 0.96, p less than 0.001; n = 9). The radioinhibitor binding displacement assay was used to measure serum concentration of enalaprilic acid (MK422) in human serum samples. Drug concentration estimated by radioinhibitor binding displacement assay correlated closely (r = 0.96, p less than 0.001; n = 22) with the drug concentration measured by a specific radioimmunoassay. The radioinhibitor binding displacement technique using [125I]MK351A as the ligand for human serum ACE has general application to all competitive ACE inhibitors, allowing comparison of in vitro ACE inhibitor potencies and estimation of serum ACE inhibitor concentrations.", 
    "231": "The responsiveness of isolated guinea pig lung parenchymal strips to substance P was enhanced by at least 100-fold in the presence of the endopeptidase inhibitors phosphoramidon (1 microM) or thiorphan (1 microM), but not with the converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, or an inhibitor of serum carboxypeptidase N (both 1 microM). Responses of guinea pig tracheal rings to substance P were also markedly potentiated by phosphoramidon. The increase in tissue responsiveness by these inhibitors was relatively specific for substance P among several other spasmogenic peptides, including formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine and the complement peptides C3a and C5a. The enhanced responses appear to result from a decrease in the rate of substance P degradation in the presence of neutral endopeptidase inhibitors. Specific binding of substance P to its receptor on bronchial membranes was increased by three- to fourfold in the presence of phosphoramidon. These data demonstrate an enhanced potential for substance P to contract lung tissues when degradation by a neutral endopeptidase-like enzyme is blocked.",

Factors stimulating this trial are data documenting the high prevalence of mild hypertension in the adult population; mild hypertension's responsibility for a high proportion of morbidity and mortality attributable to hypertension overall; data from long-term hypertension intervention trials showing reduced morbidity and mortality of people with mild hypertension with use of either diuretics or beta blockers as step-1 therapy, and other trials that failed to demonstrate beneficial impact on morbidity and mortality, possibly due to residual questions concerning aspects of benefit to risk ratios with these medications; recent data from trials showing long-term control of mild hypertension and other risk factors by nutritional means; lack of data from long-term trials on benefit to risk ratios with newer drugs such as selective alpha 1 inhibitors, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium channel blockers; paucity of data from trials on long-term combined effects of diet and drug therapy, and of diet alone, for people with mild hypertension. During the next few years, phase 1 of the trial will study 6 groups of drugs. The step-1 drugs are angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril), alpha 1 inhibitor (doxazosin), beta blocker (acebutolol), calcium channel blocker (amlodipine), diuretic (chlorthalidone) and placebo. All participants are to receive vigorous sustained nutritional counseling to reduce obesity, moderate sodium intake and avoid heavy use of alcohol. Key endpoints for phase 1 of the study are the need for additional medication to control mild hypertension, side effects (i.e., clinical and biochemical) and consequent need to discontinue drug and quality of life.

The IC50 values were 5.6 microM for enkephalinase A and 0.39 microM for enkephalin aminopeptidase. Actinonin also inhibited with an IC50 value of 1.1 microM dipeptidyl aminopeptidase tested on whole brain homogenate of rats in the presence of thiorphan and bestatin. Analgesia was assessed by measuring the tail-flick latency of mice.

    "234": "Inhibitors of the conversion of angiotensinogen to the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II have considerable value as antihypertensive agents. For example, captopril and enalapril are clinically useful as inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme. This has encouraged intense activity in the development of inhibitors of kidney renin, which is a very specific aspartic proteinase catalysing the first and rate limiting step in the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin II. The most effective inhibitors such as H-142 and L-363,564 have used non-hydrolysable analogues of the proposed transition state, and partial sequences of angiotensinogen (Table 1). H-142 is effective in lowering blood pressure in humans but has no significant effect on other aspartic proteinases such as pepsin in the human body (Table 1). At present there are no crystal structures available for human or mouse renins although three-dimensional models demonstrate close structural similarity to other spartic proteinases. We have therefore determined by X-ray analysis the three-dimensional structures of H-142 and L-363,564 complexed with the aspartic proteinase endothiapepsin, which binds these inhibitors with affinities not greatly different from those measured against human renin (Table 1). The structures of these complexes and of that between endothiapepsin and the general aspartic proteinase inhibitor, H-256 (Table 1) define the common hydrogen bonding schemes that allow subtle differences in side-chain orientations and in the positions of the transition state analogues with respect to the active-site aspartates.", 
    "235": "Cough associated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors has long been considered a rare side effect. We report 8 cases, 7 with enalapril (10 to 20 mg/day) 1 with quinapril (40 mg/day) in which cough occurred after a mean duration of treatment of 39 days. In all patients, cough disappeared with a mean delay of 2 days with no other treatment than withdrawal of the drug. In 6 patients, cough was reinduced within less than a day with the same drug; in 5 patients a second reinduction with another ACE inhibitor gave the same result. These data suggest that cough is probably more frequent than it would appear from the literature. In clinical practice, if cough occurs in a patient treated with an ACE inhibitor, the drug may be continued for a few days in order to exclude an acute viral infection; if cough lasts more than a week, specific diagnostic procedures for pulmonary disease should be initiated; if it stops, the patient may be treated either for hypertension or chronic heart failure with another ACE inhibitor.", 
    "236": "Inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme may cause angio-oedema. To see if this might be due to potentiation of the tissue effects of bradykinin the thickness of weals raised by intradermal injection of saline or 1, 3, or 10 micrograms bradykinin was measured before and three times after single doses of captopril, enalapril, or placebo. The mean thickness increased with increasing doses of bradykinin. It did not change with time after the administration of placebo or captopril but increased from 0.61 mm before enalapril to 1.12 mm two and a half hours and 1.06 mm five hours after enalapril was given. Five subjects flushed when given bradykinin after captopril and four after enalapril, but none flushed when given bradykinin after placebo. It is concluded that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors potentiate the effects of intradermal bradykinin in vivo and that this may partially explain why they cause angio-oedema in susceptible patients.",

    "238": "To examine the role of adrenergic activity on the reduction in nephron filtration rate during chronic sodium depletion in rats, we have measured all the determinants of glomerular ultrafiltration before and after acute unilateral renal denervation. We also examined whether this adrenergic influence was angiotensin II mediated by performing the same protocol with the addition of systemic infusion of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, MK 421. The results indicate that both angiotensin II and adrenergic activity contribute to the maintenance of renal vascular resistance during chronic sodium depletion. Acute renal denervation restored nephron filtration rate in chronic sodium-depleted rats (27 +/- 1 to 32 +/- 2 nl/min, P less than 0.05) to control levels (33 +/- 1 nl/min) via reductions in afferent and efferent arteriolar resistances, which also increased nephron plasma flow (85 +/- 5 to 109 +/- 6 nl/min, P less than 0.05). Infusion of MK 421 also increased plasma flow in chronic sodium-depleted rats (116 +/- 11 nl/min, P less than 0.05) through decreases in both arteriolar resistances. Denervation in MK 421-treated rats further increased nephron plasma flow to 137 +/- 10 nl/min (P less than 0.05) only as a result of decreased afferent resistance. The findings indicate that the glomerular hemodynamic changes that characterize chronic sodium depletion are primarily due to the activity of angiotensin II. However, renal adrenergic activity contributes an independent effect on afferent resistance and an effect on efferent resistance via adrenergic effects on angiotensin II.", 
    "239": "Over the past several decades, pharmacologic advances have made it possible to markedly alleviate symptoms in most patients with congestive heart failure. However, the prognosis for these patients remains poor. Five years after the onset of congestive heart failure, only approximately 50% of patients are alive; when cardiac failure develops after myocardial infarction mortality is even higher. Survival rates are only 40% to 60% after 1 year in patients with advanced symptoms who are followed in referral centers. Thirty to fifty percent of deaths are sudden and unexpected. Mortality is highest in patients with severe or progressive symptoms, but it appears to be unrelated to the cause of heart failure or its duration. In general, rate of survival is lowest in patients with the most severe depression of left ventricular function, but no hemodynamic index is capable of providing prognostic information in individual patients. Survival is also reduced in patients with frequent ventricular arrhythmias, marked electrolyte disturbances, and elevated plasma catecholamines, but again, none of these measurements are powerful discriminators between survivors and nonsurvivors. A number of pharmacologic and other interventions have the potential to alter the prognosis of congestive heart failure, either by improving or perhaps even by worsening survival. The pooled data from several short-term controlled trials have raised the possibility that the angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitors may have a beneficial effect on survival.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "240": "To assess the influence of captopril on left ventricular mass in 24 normal Sprague-Dawley rats, 12 were given high sodium (group 1) and 12 low sodium (group 2) diets. Half the rats given each diet were treated with 30 mg.kg-1/day captopril by gavage, the others were given placebo. Mean(SEM) arterial pressure was significantly reduced in group 2 treated rats (102.3(2.0) vs 123.4(1.5) mmHg, p less than 0.0002) but not in group 1 treated rats (113.8(2.5) vs 123.7(2.9)mmHg, NS). Blood pressure response to a 200 ng.kg-1 iv dose of angiotensin I was blocked in both group 2 (8.3(2.1) increase vs 29.7(3.6) mmHg increase for controls) and group 1 treated rats (7.8(2.8) increase vs 36.5(4.0) mmHg increase for controls). In group 2 treated rats the left ventricular to body weight ratio (X 10(-3)) was reduced compared with control (2.1(0.05) vs 2.4(0.08), p = 0.026), whereas in group 1 rats this ratio was not significantly different in the treated and control groups (2.3(0.06) vs 2.5(0.18), NS), suggesting that the reduction in left ventricular mass resulted from the influence of captopril on blood pressure. It is concluded that captopril causes a reduction in left ventricular mass in normal rats as a result of a reduction in blood pressure, independent of the effects of angiotensin I converting enzyme. This supports the concept that left ventricular mass is determined primarily by wall stress and is capable of both upward and downward regulation.", 
    "241": "The validity of the captopril test for primary aldosteronism (PA) was tested in patients with surgically verified PA (n = 12) or essential hypertension (EHT, n = 20) with different levels of sodium intakes. The patients were scheduled on 7 days each of three regimes of the prepared diet containing 34, 120 and 340 mEq of sodium chloride per day, and the captopril test was repeated in each period. For the test, captopril (50 mg) was administered orally at 9:00 A.M. after 1 hour of rest in a supine position, and venous blood samples were obtained before and 90 min after drug administration. Plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC; ng/dl) and plasma renin activity (PRA; ng/ml/h) were measured by radioimmunoassay. Under the three different sodium intakes, a PAC/PRA ratio greater than 20 at 90 min after captopril administration was sufficiently sensitive (0.95, 19/20) and specific (0.92, 55/60) to identify PA. Similarly, PA was associated with a PAC above 15 ng/dl 90 min after captopril. There were no complaints associated with the antihypertensive effects of the drug even when patients were sodium-restricted. These results confirmed that the captopril test is safe and useful for screening out-patients for PA, independent of individual differences in sodium intake.", 
    "242": "The Intensive Medicines Monitoring Programme (IMP), a specialised part of the New Zealand Post Marketing Surveillance system, has been used to monitor captopril since it was first approved for marketing for the treatment of hypertension and heart failure. Monitoring has consisted of (1) spontaneous reporting for which doctors have been encouraged to report all clinical events, (2) a specific event recording survey at the end of the first year and (3) a controlled patient survey of taste disturbance. The IMP gathers prescription information on about 85% of all patients. There were 4,124 patients at the end of the first 4 years. Reported events involved 4% of patients, the majority being cutaneous (1%) and gastrointestinal (0.7%). The event recording survey gave an overall rate of adverse events of 2.2 per patient year. The taste survey showed a remarkably high incidence of taste disturbance in the control population and only taste loss was significantly higher (P less than 0.01) for captopril. This ongoing study has so far demonstrated a low incidence of adverse effects due to captopril, which is reassuring in view of its increasing use for mild hypertension and early cardiac failure.", 
    "243": "Fifteen elderly hypertensives aged fifty-nine to seventy-four years received captopril either as a monotherapy (group I, n=7) or as an addition to other antihypertensive drugs (group II, n=8) for twelve to fourteen months. Both the mean supine and erect blood pressure fell from 173.3 +/- 3.4/93.3 +/- 6.6 to 143.3 +/- 3.4/78.3 +/- 1.7 and from 166.7 +/- 8.6/98.3 +/- 4.4 to 146.7 +/- 12.0/85.0 +/- 2.9 mm Hg, respectively, in group I, and from 165.6 +/- 10.5/104.9 +/- 4.4 to 128.8 +/- 4.7/84.1 +/- 1.7 and from 154.0 +/- 10.1/107.8 +/- 3.3 to 126.3 +/- 6.0/88.8 +/- 1.2 mm Hg, respectively, in group II. There was a slight but insignificant reduction in pulse rate and body weight. Side effects were minimal. All patients experienced a sense of well-being. There was no impairment of renal function in most patients and no reduction in serum K. This study suggests that, in elderly hypertensives, captopril reduces blood pressure safely and effectively without impairing perfusion to the brain, heart, and kidneys and without causing edema or hypokalemia.", 
    "244": "A reaction of gold(I) thiomalates [Au(tm)], \"Myocrisin\" (an antiarthritic drug), with captopril (a high blood pressure drug) was carried out in aqueous solution at pH 7.20 using 13C NMR spectroscopy. Captopril, which exists in the cis (c) and trans (t) isomer forms, binds strongly with gold(I), ejecting thiomalate (Htm) as free ligand into solution.", 
    "245": "The effects of the antihypertensive drugs clonidine, prazosin, and MK 422 (the active parent diacid of enalapril) were studied on the cutaneous blood flow and allergen evoked inflammatory skin reactions in ovalbumin sensitized guinea pigs. The hypotensive effect of the drugs did not significantly change the basal cutaneous blood flow at the time of allergen challenge. MK 422 (0.02 mg/kg) markedly enhanced the wheal and flare reaction following allergen challenge, whereas clonidine (0.005 and 0.05 mg/kg) inhibited the inflammatory response. Prazosin (0.03 mg/kg) did not significantly influence the wheal and flare reaction. Our results indicate that some antihypertensive drugs (clonidine) could be beneficial to antihypertensive patients with inflammatory diseases, while others (ACE-inhibitors) may enhance their inflammatory disorders.", 
    "246": "We have localized angiotensin converting enzyme in rat brain and pituitary gland immunohistochemically with an anti-rat lung angiotensin converting enzyme monoclonal antibody. The distribution of immunoreactive angiotensin converting enzyme is identical with that of binding sites for the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, [3H]captopril. Most intense staining is in the choroid plexus and subfornical organ, with intermediate values in the caudate-putamen, globus pallidus, entopeduncular nucleus, pars reticulata of the substantia nigra, posterior pituitary and anterior pituitary. Lower levels are observed in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus. Within the basal ganglia angiotensin converting enzyme immunoreactivity is distributed throughout the neuropil; no cell bodies are stained, even after colchicine treatment. The punctate pattern of immunoreactivity in the anterior pituitary corresponds to the distribution of endothelial cells. The posterior pituitary is stained diffusely. Angiotensin converting enzyme is increased by 45% in the posterior lobe after pituitary stalk section, demonstrating that this diffuse staining is associated with pituicytes. Antibody specificity was demonstrated by the immunoaffinity purification of angiotensin converting enzyme to homogeneity from crude tissue extracts using anti-angiotensin converting enzyme antibody and protein A-sepharose. The apparent molecular weight by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of lung, choroid plexus and anterior pituitary angiotensin converting enzyme is 175,000. In the substantia nigra and caudate putamen, where angiotensin converting enzyme is localized to neuronal as opposed to epithelial cells, the molecular weight is 165,000. The pituicyte angiotensin converting enzyme of the posterior pituitary is 170,000 daltons.", 
    "247": "The role of angiotensin converting enzyme in the metabolism of bradykinin and angiotensin I by in vitro human basilar artery and rabbit aorta was studied. On both human basilar artery and rabbit aorta concentration-effects curves to angiotensin I were significantly attenuated by captopril at a concentration which had no effect on bradykinin responses on both tissues. The metabolism of bradykinin and angiotensin I was studied using high performance liquid chromatography. Both peptides were broken down by human basilar artery and rabbit aorta in a similar fashion. The breakdown of angiotensin I but not bradykinin was significantly attenuated by captopril. 1,10-phenanthroline did attenuate breakdown of bradykinin but this was found not to be significant compared with controls. The results confirm that angiotensin converting enzyme is present in both these tissues and is important for the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. It appears that other peptidases are important in the breakdown of kinins by these tissues and should be taken into account when investigating the mechanism of action of such peptides on these vascular preparations.", 
    "248": "Pericytes and endothelial cells from the same sample of adult rat lung have been separately established in culture by use of selective growth media. The endothelial cells are positive and the pericytes negative for angiotensin-converting enzyme activity and tissue plasminogen activator. Morphologically in culture, the pericytes are similar to pericytes from bovine retina and other sites and show positive immunofluorescence to both human platelet (non-muscle) myosin and smooth muscle myosin. In this respect they resemble smooth muscle cells grown from the rat main pulmonary artery, but lack the myofilaments and dense bodies characteristic of muscle cells. Lung endothelial cells and fibroblasts are positive only for platelet myosin. Pericytes in culture demonstrate an unusual growth response to endothelial substrate, obtained by removing confluent endothelial monolayers with nonionic detergent or alkali. When plated onto this material at low density, pericyte growth is inhibited. By contrast, the substrate stimulates the growth of endothelial cells and has no effect on smooth muscle cells. Initial attachment of endothelial cells and pericytes to the substrate is similar.", 
    "249": "In nonazotemic patients we suggest that ACE inhibitors initially depress GFR, perhaps due to a fall in renal blood flow in those patients in whom a substantial fall in blood pressure occurs with the first dose. Autoregulation of renal blood flow apparently remains intact, but autoregulation of the GFR is impaired during ACE inhibition. Our experience is that sodium and water retention usually ensue and plasma volume expands, leading to a temporary restoration of renal blood flow and GFR towards baseline. Serum sodium is usually reduced at this time, weight in increased, and blood pressure may be partly restored. After about 1-2 weeks, natriuresis begins, although sodium balance and weight probably are not restored to normal for 4-8 weeks. As the plasma volume contracts again, blood pressure falls further and the GFR declines. Renal blood flow, however, is maintained by preferential reduction in renovascular resistance.", 
    "250": "The acute and chronic antihypertensive and renal effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril, were studied prospectively in ten hypertensive renal transplant recipients. Acute administration of enalapril produced a significant decrement in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure but had no significant effect on glomerular filtration rate or effective renal plasma flow. The antihypertensive effect of enalapril was enhanced by gradually increasing the dose of the drug or by addition of a diuretic during six to eight weeks of chronic therapy. During chronic enalapril therapy, four patients developed renal insufficiency that reversed after discontinuation of the drug. In three of these four cases, overt renal insufficiency was associated temporally with the addition of a diuretic. Digital angiography revealed unequivocal transplant renal-artery stenosis in three of the four patients with renal insufficiency; the fourth patient had diffuse narrowing of the transplant renal artery without a discrete stenosis. It is concluded that enalapril alone or in combination with a diuretic is effective in lowering blood pressure in patients with post-transplant hypertension. The development of renal insufficiency during enalapril therapy may be exacerbated by concomitant diuretic therapy and should raise the suspicion of underlying transplant renal-artery stenosis. The acute blood pressure or renal response to a small dose of enalapril does not reliably predict the development of renal insufficiency during treatment with larger doses of the drug.", 
    "251": "The effect of chronic converting enzyme inhibition with enalapril on the PRA, PRL and plasma aldosterone responses to metoclopramide was studied in 10 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. Enalapril reduced supine blood pressure and increased heart rate significantly. PRA and urinary sodium excretion rose significantly. PRA levels did not change after metoclopramide neither during placebo nor during enalapril. The aldosterone response to metoclopramide was not altered by enalapril, indicating that this response is independent of the renin-angiotensin system. The PRL response to metoclopramide was considerably enhanced after 4 weeks of treatment with enalapril. It is proposed that enalapril, by decreasing the formation of angiotensin II, increases the prolactin reserve.", 
    "252": "Proximal tubular reabsorption, stop-flow pressure (SFP), and single nephron glomerular filtration rate (SNGFR) were measured in the absence of and during infusion of an isotonic saline solution containing either angiotensin I (ANG I; 10(-6) to 10(-5) M) or angiotensin II (ANG II; 10(-9) to 10(-7) M) into an adjacent peritubular capillary at a rate of 20 nl/min. Dilution of the infused ANG I and ANG II occurred in the peritubular capillary blood and as the peptides diffused into the interstitium. Infusion of either 10(-7) M ANG II or 10(-5) M ANG I increased proximal fractional fluid reabsorption (FRH2O) and decreased both SFP and SNGFR. There were no significant changes in FRH2O or SNGFR during infusion of 10(-5) M ANG I when the converting enzyme inhibitor enalaprilat (MK 422, 10(-3) M) was added to the infusate. Similarly, peritubular infusion at lower concentrations of either ANG II (10(-9) or 10(-8) M) or ANG I (10(-6) M) did not alter FRH2O, SFP, or SNGFR. These data indicate that conversion of ANG I to ANG II can occur in the peritubular capillary or interstitial environment and that increases above the normal endogenous levels in the postglomerular interstitial ANG II concentration can enhance proximal tubular reabsorption and increase preglomerular resistance and thereby reduce SNGFR.", 
    "253": "Systemic and coronary hemodynamic, metabolic and humoral effects of a new intravenous angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, enalaprilat, were evaluated in 14 patients with chronic heart failure. Onset of hemodynamic action occurred within 15 minutes and persisted for 6 hours. At the time of peak effect, there was a significant reduction in mean arterial pressure (-21%) and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (-33%). Systemic vascular resistance decreased by 32% and stroke volume index increased by 20%. These systemic hemodynamic changes indicate improved left ventricular function. There was a substantial sustained reduction in rate-pressure product initially without a change in coronary sinus blood flow or myocardial oxygen consumption. There was also reduced myocardial oxygen extraction and augmented coronary sinus oxygen saturation at 30 minutes and 1 hour. In three patients, abnormal myocardial lactate extraction, present before enalaprilat, changed to uptake after enalaprilat, indicating amelioration of myocardial ischemia that was not clinically manifest. Systemic catecholamine levels and myocardial catecholamine balance did not change. Plasma renin activity increased and plasma aldosterone decreased. These findings suggest that enalaprilat produces inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme and consequent beneficial systemic hemodynamic changes in heart failure. In some patients with heart failure, silent myocardial ischemia at rest can occur and can be alleviated with enalaprilat. Decreased myocardial oxygen extraction, increased coronary sinus oxygen saturation and lack of expected decrease in coronary sinus blood flow despite reduced rate-pressure product suggest transient coronary vasodilation by enalaprilat.", 
    "254": "The pharmacokinetic interaction between pentopril (250 mg) and furosemide (40 mg) was studied in 12 normal healthy volunteers after oral administration of each drug alone and in combination. No significant changes in any pharmacokinetic parameters of pentopril or its active metabolite (CGS 13934) were observed on coadministration of furosemide. In contrast, pentopril induced significant changes in disposition of furosemide. Pentopril decreased renal clearance (CLR) of furosemide by 54% and the fraction excreted unchanged in urine also decreased by 55%. However, such decrease in CLR of furosemide was compensated by a simultaneous increase in glucuronidation (by 200%), resulting in a slight increase in systemic clearance (decreased AUC). Systemic bioavailability of furosemide appears to be unchanged in the presence of pentopril (0.46 vs. 0.41). No effect of pentopril on plasma protein binding of furosemide was detected. In spite of the decreased CLR and urinary excretion rate of furosemide, the urinary output (1749 vs. 1774 ml/6 hr) and Na+ excretion (757 vs. 816 mEq/6 hr) remained almost unchanged. These findings suggest that total furosemide (unchanged and glucuronide) might contribute to diuresis and natriuresis rather than the unchanged furosemide alone. Because of unchanged pharmacodynamic effect, such pharmacokinetic interaction may not require any dosage adjustment for furosemide on pentopril coadministration.", 
    "255": "To investigate the determinants of mortality in patients with chronic congestive heart failure, we prospectively evaluated 84 patients with this disorder who underwent detailed biochemical, clinical, and functional tests at the time of initial evaluation and were then followed for 12 to 52 months (mean 31). During this period of follow-up, 58% of the patients died, of whom 71% died suddenly. The most important pretreatment predictor of mortality in these patients was the frequency of ventricular extrasystoles, followed by echocardiographic fractional shortening, a diagnosis of coronary artery disease, and duration of treadmill exercise. The finding of hypokalemia and hyponatremia in these patients at the time of entry into the study was associated with a poor prognosis by univariate analytical methods, but these electrolyte abnormalities did not provide independent prognostic information. The presence of ventricular arrhythmias was related to the severity of left ventricular dysfunction, exercise intolerance, and neurohormonal activation, suggesting that such arrhythmias are multifactorial in origin and may not simply be related to electrolyte abnormalities.", 
    "256": "Careful interpretation of clinical clues continues to provide valuable information to identify patients in whom further evaluation for renovascular hypertension (RVH) is needed. Newer diagnostic techniques such as intravenous digital subtraction angiography and computer-generated renal flow scans have helped to more accurately identify patients in whom renal arteriography is indicated. More sensitive and specific tests are still needed to establish the hemodynamic significance of renal artery lesions. New classes of antihypertensive drugs, particularly beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, have enabled the control of blood pressure in most patients with RVH but do not assure preservation of renal function. An aggressive search for and correction of coexisting risk factors, and improved surgical techniques, have resulted in lower surgical mortality. The development of percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty has provided an invasive, nonsurgical method for managing RVH in selected patients.", 
    "257": "The diuretic and natriuretic responses to atrial natriuretic peptide in conscious rats with cirrhosis (chronic bile duct ligation) were examined. Cirrhotic rats had sodium retention, ascites, and elevated liver weights. In conscious control rats, atrial natriuretic peptide increased urine flow rate and urinary sodium excretion. In conscious cirrhotic rats, atrial natriuretic peptide had no effect on urine flow rate or urinary sodium excretion. Renal denervation reversed the blunted diuretic and natriuretic responses to atrial natriuretic peptide in cirrhotic rats. Renal sympathetic nerve activity increased in conscious cirrhotic rats during infusion of atrial natriuretic peptide but decreased in conscious control rats. Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system with captopril had no effect on the diuretic or natriuretic responses to atrial natriuretic peptide in conscious control or cirrhotic rats. Mean arterial pressure, glomerular filtration rate, and renal plasma flow were affected similarly by atrial natriuretic peptide in control and cirrhotic rats. Increased renal sympathetic nerve activity, but not angiotensin II, mediates the blunted diuretic and natriuretic responses to atrial natriuretic peptide in conscious cirrhotic rats.", 
    "258": "Radioisotope renography was performed in 21 patients with hypertension and unilateral renal artery stenosis with and without premedication with 25 mg of captopril, and the results were compared with the effect of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty on the blood pressure, assessed 6 weeks after angioplasty. Angioplasty caused a considerable decrease in blood pressure in 15 of the 21 patients. In 12 of these 15 patients, captopril induced changes in the time-activity curves of the affected kidney only, suggesting deterioration of the excretory function of that kidney, while the function of the contralateral kidney remained normal. After angioplasty the asymmetry in the time-activity curves diminished despite identical pretreatment with captopril. Such captopril-induced unilateral impairment of the renal function was not seen in the six patients with unilateral renal artery stenosis whose blood pressure did not change after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty or in 13 patients with hypertension and normal renal arteries. The functional impairment of the affected kidneys was characterized by a decrease of 99mTc-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid uptake and a delay of 131I-hippurate excretion, while the 131I-hippurate uptake remained unaffected. These data are in agreement with a reduced glomerular filtration rate and diuresis during preservation of the renal blood flow, changes that can be expected after converting enzyme inhibition in a kidney with low perfusion and an active, renin-mediated autoregulation of the glomerular filtration rate. These data suggest that functional captopril-induced unilateral changes, shown by split renal function studies with noninvasive gamma camera scintigraphy, can be used as a diagnostic test for renovascular hypertension caused by unilateral renal artery stenosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "259": "The effect of adding either nifedipine or captopril as third-line agents was studied in a single-blind crossover fashion in 24 patients with essential hypertension uncontrolled by combination beta blocker and diuretic therapy. Nineteen patients completed both phases of the study. The mean initial sitting blood pressure before the addition of nifedipine was 164/109 mm Hg and captopril 165/108 mm Hg. Both nifedipine and captopril produced further significant reductions in both sitting and standing blood pressure, 47% of the captopril-treated patients achieving target blood pressure of less than 160/95 mm Hg compared with 67% with nifedipine. Further increase in the dosage resulted in 63% of the captopril- and 81% of the nifedipine-treated patients achieving target blood pressure. There were, however, no statistically significant differences in the mean fall in blood pressure or in the number of patients obtaining target pressure at the end of each treatment period. Captopril treatment also resulted in a small reduction of pulse rate, and, although pulse rates rose with nifedipine, these changes were not significant. Both treatments were generally well tolerated, and serious side effects were not reported. Both nifedipine and captopril were effective and well tolerated as third-line antihypertensive agents.", 
    "260": "The neurohormonal contribution to high blood pressure was investigated in 9 conscious two-kidney, two-clip Goldblatt (2K2C) hypertensive dogs during evolution of the benign and malignant phases after application of bilateral renal clips (BRC). Serial measurements were taken of the plasma renin activity (PRA), plasma angiotensin I-immunoreactivity (Ang I-ir), plasma angiotensin II-ir (Ang II-ir), renin substrate (RS) catecholamines [epinephrine (Epi) and norepinephrine (NE)] and vasopressin (AVP). Immediately after BRC, the elevation of the blood pressure (86 +/- 3 to 110 +/- 3 mmHg, p less than 0.01) was associated with an increase in heart rate (93 +/- 3 to 114 +/- 9 beats/min, p less than 0.01). These hemodynamic changes were accompanied by increases in PRA, Ang I-ir, Ang II-ir, Epi, NE and AVP. The renin angiotensin system was activated throughout the 3 week period following BRC, as indicated by increases in PRA, Ang I-ir and Ang II-ir. Catecholamines were elevated immediately after BRC, followed by a return toward the control values. AVP underwent a slight but not significant elevation after BRC, which was sustained during the 3 weeks. Production of malignant hypertension was affected by occlusion of one of the adjustable renal clips 3 weeks after BRC. A marked elevation of the blood pressure was associated with significant increases in PRA, Ang I-ir, Ang II-ir, Epi, NE and AVP, compared with the pre-occlusion values. In addition, pharmacologic experiments were performed in 6 of 9 dogs. Administration of angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor (SQ 14225) reduced the blood pressure both in the benign and malignant phases of 2K2C renovascular hypertension, and a ganglionic blocking agent (hexamethonium) also decreased the blood pressure. However, a specific, vascular acting AVP antagonist failed to reduce the blood pressure significantly. From this study, it seems likely that severe renal ischemia caused by renal clipping caused the activation of the renin-angiotensin and the sympathetic nervous system and elevation of serum vasopressin. However, there are no apparent differences between the benign and malignant phases of renovascular hypertension, except for the marked elevation of neurohormone levels in malignant hypertension.", 
    "261": "Vasodilator therapy represents an important step forward in the treatment of chronic left ventricular failure. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors appear to be the most versatile vasodilators, but selected direct-acting vasodilators, sympathetic inhibitors (prazosin), and possibly calcium channel antagonists (nifedipine and diltiazem) may be useful in certain situations. The bipyridine derivatives possess potent inotropic and vasodilating properties. The efficacy of intravenously administered amrinone and milrinone has been proven in the treatment of refractory left ventricular failure. Whether oral administration of milrinone or other bipyridine derivatives will prove to be safe and effective in the long-term treatment of chronic left ventricular failure remains uncertain.", 
    "262": "Support for the concept that neurohormonal mechanisms play an important role in determining the survival of patients with severe chronic heart failure is derived from two lines of evidence: circulating levels of neurohormones are markedly elevated in patients who have a poor long-term prognosis and the survival of high-risk patients may be favorably modified by treatment with specific neurohormonal antagonists. Plasma norepinephrine is a major prognostic factor in patients with severe chronic heart failure, the most markedly elevated levels being observed in patients with the most unfavorable long-term prognosis. Data from uncontrolled studies suggest that low-dose beta-blockade may improve the survival of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. Similar trends were noted in the Beta-Blocker Heart Attack Trial, in which patients with congestive heart failure before or accompanying their acute myocardial infarction experienced a significant reduction in sudden death when treated with beta-blockers. In contrast, there appeared to be little selective benefit in patients without heart failure, who presumably had low circulating levels of catecholamines. Similarly, serum sodium concentration is a major prognostic factor in patients with severe chronic heart failure, the shortest survival being observed in patients with the most severe hyponatremia. The poor long-term outcome of hyponatremic patients appears to be related to the marked elevation of plasma renin activity in these individuals, since (in retrospective studies) hyponatremic patients appeared to fare significantly better when treated with converting-enzyme inhibitors than when treated with vasodilator drugs that did not interfere with angiotensin II formation. In contrast, there appeared to be no selective benefit of converting-enzyme inhibition on the survival of patients with a normal serum sodium concentration, in whom plasma renin activity was low. These data suggest that neurohormonal systems may exert a deleterious effect on the survival of some patients with severe chronic heart failure, which may be favorably modified by long-term treatment with specific neurohormonal antagonists.", 
    "263": "The antihypertensive effect of enalaprilat (MK-422), an intravenous (IV), nonsulfhydryl converting-enzyme inhibitor, was evaluated in a double-blind study of 14 patients with mild to moderate hypertension. The seven patients in the treatment group initially received IV enalaprilat 1.25 mg q6h for 24 hours. Thereafter, responding patients (diastolic blood pressure [BP] less than or equal to 95 mm Hg) continued receiving this dose q6h for an additional 24 hours, whereas nonresponding patients were increased to IV enalaprilat 5 mg q6h for another 24 hours. Baseline BP for enalaprilat was 161 +/- 5/107 +/- 2 mm Hg (+/- SEM), and for placebo it was 150 +/- 5/103 +/- 2 mm Hg. Within the first 60 minutes, a significant reduction in both systolic and diastolic BP was noted in the enalaprilat group (P less than .05), without significant changes occurring in the placebo group. Although there was a gradual decline in both systolic and diastolic BP throughout the 48-hour study period in the placebo group, systolic and diastolic BP reduction was greater in the enalaprilat group, reaching a maximal decrease of 133 +/- 3/87 +/- 3 mm Hg. Adverse side effects did not occur in any patient.", 
    "264": "Lisinopril is a long-acting converting-enzyme inhibitor. A 52-week study was undertaken to compare the antihypertensive efficacy and safety of lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), and a combination of the two drugs in 24 patients with a sitting diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 90 to 120 mm Hg. After a four-week single-blind placebo-washout phase, ten patients received lisinopril, ten received HCTZ, and four received the combination in increasing doses in a double-blind fashion for the next 12 weeks. The target blood pressure was less than 90 mm Hg DBP and a decrease of at least 10 mm Hg. For the next 12 weeks, the responders continued to receive the same medications; however, the nonresponders from the two groups received the combination, increasing the number of patients receiving both to 13. The DBP was controlled in eight of the ten patients with lisinopril, three of the ten patients with HCTZ, and 11 of 13 (four original and nine nonresponders) with the combination. For the next 28 weeks, 17 patients agreed to continue into a single-blind phase, during which blood pressure was controlled in six of the seven patients who were treated with lisinopril alone and nine of ten who received the combination. The heart rate rose significantly in the HCTZ-treated patients during the short-term treatment and decreased significantly in those treated with lisinopril during the long-term phase. Side effects were more frequent in patients receiving the combination but were always mild and subsided spontaneously. Lisinopril appeared to be more effective than HCTZ as a step-1 drug, and the combination was superior to either agent alone.", 
    "265": "Three patients are described in whom haemodynamic collapse and acute renal failure occurred following intercurrent gastrointestinal fluid loss during treatment with an angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitor. The possible consequences of blockade of the formation of angiotensin II during fluid loss are discussed.", 
    "266": "The usefulness of vasodilating agents in congestive heart failure depends on their ability to diminish left ventricular afterload; this effect does not necessarily persist with long-term treatment. The present study reports the clinical response of 16 patients in heart failure; the trial was double blind with enalapril and/or placebo during 24 weeks. Diagnoses were dilated cardiomyopathy in six, rheumatic heart disease in five, ischemic heart disease in four und hypertensive heart disease in one. Two patients on enalapril died of non cardiac causes and one was withdrawn from the study due to pregnancy. In those patients treated with enalapril the NYHA functional class improved from 2.9/0.8 to 1.1/0.4 (p less than 0.001), and the effort capacity increased from 545/171 to 888/160 seconds (p less than 0.01). Left ventricular systolic function evaluated by echocardiogram and Tc 99 m ventriculogram, radiologic size of the heart and echocardiographic left ventricular diameters showed no significant changes. There were no adverse clinical effects nor laboratory abnormalities. It is concluded that in this study, enalapril produced sustained clinical improvement in patients with heart failure and it was well tolerated during long-term treatment.", 
    "267": "Dopexamine (FPL 60278) is a new vasodilator possessing both postjunctional dopaminergic and beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist actions. Its acute haemodynamic effects were compared in a cross-over study with those of dobutamine, captopril, and glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) in eight adult patients with chronic heart failure. Dopexamine, 1 microgram/kg/min intravenously (i.v.) for 10 min, increased cardiac index, systolic blood pressure, and heart rate while reducing systemic vascular resistance. Pulmonary artery end-diastolic pressure was unchanged. Plasma norepinephrine (NE) increased during dopexamine infusion. No arrhythmias occurred. Dobutamine, 5 micrograms/kg/min i.v. for 10 min, increased cardiac index and systolic blood pressure similarly but did not increase heart rate or reduce vascular resistance. Captopril, 25 mg orally, did not alter cardiac index at 1 h, but reduced heart rate, blood pressure, pulmonary diastolic pressure, and vascular resistance. GTN, 100 micrograms sublingually, reduced pulmonary diastolic pressure but did not affect other variables at 5 min. Dopexamine, because it combines some of the properties of dopamine and salbutamol, may have a role in the management of severe low output cardiac failure.", 
    "268": "Thirty-two patients with arterial hypertension (diastolic blood pressure greater than 95 mm Hg) were treated with ramipril for 3 months. The aim of the study was to achieve an effective decrease in blood pressure and demonstrate reliably and reproducibly that regression of left ventricular hypertrophy takes place with ramipril treatment. Nuclear magnetic resonance images and echocardiographic measurements of the left ventricle were therefore made before treatment started, 4 hours after the first dose, 14 days after the start of treatment and after 3 months of treatment. The thickness of the septum decreased from 19.57 to 15.20 mm on magnetic resonance scans and from 18.78 to 14.57 mm on echocardiograms. The values were reproduced 3 times at the same measuring point and means were calculated. The septum and posterior wall of the left ventricle were also measured at 3 different points. With negligible scatter, the values obtained were reproducible and the differences were highly significant (p = 0.001). A parallel decrease in blood pressure to levels 15% below baseline was also observed. The therapeutic aim of achieving diastolic blood pressure levels of less than or equal to 90 mm Hg was achieved in all patients. In addition to reducing the blood pressure significantly, the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril caused a significant regression of pathologic left ventricular hypertrophy, which was demonstrated clearly using magnetic resonance imaging and echocardiography.", 
    "269": "The kinetics of blood pressure changes and plasma angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition in response to ramipril (HOE 498), 10 mg orally, were studied in 6 nephrectomized subjects 12 hours after ultrafiltration and in 10 patients with essential hypertension. Ramipril lowered supine and standing blood pressure in both groups, but the effect was greater in essential hypertension. The maximal blood pressure response followed the effect on plasma ACE after a lag time of 3 to 4 hours in both groups. These data provide indirect evidence that ramipril lowers blood pressure, at least in part, independently of its effect on the circulating renin-angiotensin system, possibly by acting on tissue ACE.", 
    "270": "The effect of ramipril on diurnal variations of blood pressure was studied in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension in groups given once- (n = 18) and twice-daily (n = 21) administration with daily dosages ranging from 2.5 to 10 mg. After ramipril treatment, the blood pressure of patients in both groups was significantly reduced, and no significant differences in diurnal variation of blood pressure were observed between the 2 groups. The pulse rate did not change after administration of ramipril and no serious side effects were observed. In consideration of patient compliance, once-daily administration of ramipril seems to be optimal for the treatment of essential hypertension.", 
    "271": "Nonrestricted blood pressure recording was performed invasively or noninvasively, using new portable devices, for a period of 24 hours in 4 patients with essential hypertension before and after 6- to 17-day treatment with ramipril at an initial dosage of 1.25 mg daily. Ramipril produced a steady decrease in blood pressure without changing heart rate. Before initiation of ramipril treatment, the blood pressure was lower during the night than during the day. This day to night difference was not affected by ramipril. In addition, analysis of the standard deviation of the mean for each time point examined during 24 hours revealed no effect of ramipril on circadian variation of blood pressure.", 
    "272": "The effect of various doses of ramipril, a new converting enzyme inhibitor, was compared with that of placebo in patients with mild essential hypertension. After a single dose of 2.5 mg blood pressure was not significantly affected, despite a decrease in converting enzyme levels. Single doses of 5 or 10 mg did reduce blood pressure, although complete inhibition of the enzyme was apparent only with the higher dose. Despite partial recovery, both converting enzyme and blood pressure remained reduced for 48 hours. After 1 month of treatment with 10 mg of ramipril, renal vascular resistance had decreased and renal blood flow increased. Continued treatment for 1 year controlled blood pressure in 6 of 10 patients; in the remainder a diuretic needed to be added to maintain control of blood pressure.", 
    "273": "The pharmacokinetics of ramipril (HOE 498) were studied after oral administration of a single 10 mg dose to 24 hypertensive patients with different degrees of renal function. The creatinine clearance ranged between 4.1 and 126 ml/min/1.73 m2 and was below 35 ml/min/1.73 m2 in 16 patients. Angiotensin converting enzyme activity and the concentrations of ramipril and its active diacid metabolite ramiprilat were measured in plasma up to 10 days after drug intake. Urine levels of ramipril, ramiprilat, their glucuronides and 2 major metabolites (a diketopiperazine and a diketopiperazine acid) were measured up to 4 days after medication. The plasma concentration-time curve of ramiprilat was polyphasic with an initial steep decline after the peak level and a subsequent very long terminal phase at low concentrations. Impaired renal function resulted in higher peak levels of ramiprilat, longer times to peak and a markedly slower decline of plasma ramiprilat levels. Hence, the duration of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition was considerably prolonged in renal failure and depended on the severity of renal impairment. The urinary excretion of ramipril and its metabolites decreased with decreasing renal function and was linearly related to the creatinine clearance, suggesting an alternative pathway of elimination. The pattern of excretion rates of ramipril and its various metabolites was not affected by renal failure. In contrast to the marked changes in the renal elimination, no relevant differences were observed in the absorption of ramipril from the gastrointestinal tract. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased in all groups. The single 10 mg dose of ramipril was well tolerated.", 
    "274": "The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the novel angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor ramipril were studied in 6 patients with a glomerular filtration rate of less than 20 ml/min/1.73 m2 of body surface area. A single oral dose of 5 mg was given and serum concentrations of the compound and its diacid, the active metabolite (ramiprilat), as well as ACE activity, blood pressure and pulse rate were monitored for 28 days. The original compound reached peak serum concentrations of 42.8 +/- 26.5 ng/ml about 1 hour after dosing and was completely eliminated from the serum after 24 hours. Ramiprilat reached peak values of 14.4 +/- 11.6 ng/ml after about 6 hours. In contrast with the parent compound, low concentrations of ramiprilat were still detected in the serum after 28 days. ACE activity decreased to approximately 5% of baseline values, remained low for the next 48 hours, then increased slowly thereafter but reached only 84.5% of initial values after 28 days. Blood pressure decreased significantly and remained low for 24 hours after dosing. The drug was well tolerated in all patients. It is concluded that a single 5 mg dose of ramipril was effective in inhibiting plasma ACE activity and lowering blood pressure in patients with renal failure. There was a slower decline in ramiprilat concentrations compared with subjects with normal renal function.", 
    "275": "Coadministration of captopril has been shown to increase serum digoxin concentration. The effects of ramipril, a new angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, on serum digoxin concentration after multiple dosing were studied in 12 healthy volunteers. All subjects were receiving steady-state digoxin medication (0.5 mg daily), and ramipril (5 mg daily) was coadministered for 14 days. Serum digoxin concentration was measured repeatedly before, during and up to 1 week after ramipril coadministration at 8 a.m. (trough values) and on selected trial days at 11 a.m., 3 hours after the morning medication. Simultaneously, blood levels of ramipril and its active metabolite diacid were determined. Volunteers were followed closely for side effects and for changes in blood pressure, heart rate and electrocardiogram. Safety pharmacology included serial determination of sodium, potassium, serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, creatinine and a full blood count. Mean serum digoxin concentration was not significantly influenced by ramipril coadministration with trough levels of 0.90 +/- 0.24 before, 0.93 +/- 0.38 during and 0.82 +/- 0.33 ng/ml after ramipril medication. The increase in serum digoxin concentration 3 hours after the morning dose was also not significantly affected by ramipril. Serum levels of ramipril and its diacid showed a wide range of variation. Mean serum potassium increased by 0.3 mmol/liter during ramipril coadministration with development of symptomless hyperkalemia (6.0 mmol/liter) in 1 subject. The only other side effect possibly related to ramipril was a dry cough in 1 subject. Both drugs were well tolerated. Ramipril showed no significant influence on serum digoxin levels in healthy volunteers.", 
    "276": "The effect of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril on catecholamine disposition and noradrenaline reactivity was studied in normotensive volunteers. In the first study 5 mg of ramipril or placebo was given 3 times at 12-hour intervals in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over manner (n = 10). In the second study, ramipril 10 mg daily was given for 2 weeks (n = 6). Noradrenaline reactivity increased significantly (p less than 0.05) both in short- and long-term application, while blood pressure decreased (p less than 0.01). Sulfoconjugated plasma noradrenaline decreased significantly (p less than 0.05) possibly indicating a decrease in sympathetic tone. These findings suggest that a decrease in sympathetic tone could contribute to the blood pressure-lowering effect of ramipril, whereas the increase in noradrenaline reactivity is probably a consequence of the primary change in sympathetic activity.", 
    "277": "Arterial blood pressure, heart rate and the response of these hemodynamic parameters to exogenous norepinephrine were investigated in healthy volunteers (daily sodium intake of 150 mmol) during a control period and after a single oral dose of 5 mg of the angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor ramipril (HOE 498). Norepinephrine was infused at doses of 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 micrograms kg-1 min-1, each for 10 minutes, during control and 3 hours after ramipril administration. Exogenous norepinephrine induced a dose-dependent increase in mean arterial blood pressure from 76.4 +/- 0.9 mm Hg during control to 85.6 +/- 1.5, 92.2 +/- 1.8 and 98.4 +/- 2.4 mm Hg, respectively. Ramipril significantly affected the baroreceptor set point with a decrease in mean blood pressure (72.1 +/- 1.7 vs 76.4 +/- 0.9 mm Hg, p less than 0.01) in the presence of unchanged heart rate (71.7 +/- 0.9 vs 73.6 +/- 1.5 min-1). Baroreceptor sensitivity, estimated by the slope of the delta blood pressure versus delta heart rate relation, was not affected by ACE inhibition. Also, the pressor effect of exogenous norepinephrine was unchanged by converting enzyme inhibition. The present results show that ACE inhibition with ramipril in sodium-replete healthy volunteers induces a decrease in blood pressure that is not accompanied by changes in heart rate, pressor sensitivity to exogenous norepinephrine or baroreceptor sensitivity.", 
    "278": "The effects of a 10 mg dose of ramipril, a new angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, on systemic blood pressure, heart rate, brachial artery blood flow, brachial artery diameter, carotid artery blood flow, carotid artery diameter, forearm vascular resistance, plasma ACE and renin activities and plasma aldosterone were investigated. Ramipril's effects in 6 healthy volunteers on a normal sodium diet were compared with those of placebo over a 24-hour period after oral drug intake in an open cross-over trial. Ramipril inhibited plasma ACE activity, an effect that peaked at 3 to 4 hours and persisted up to at least 24 hours. Plasma renin activity increased from 4 to 12 hours after drug intake and plasma aldosterone was slightly decreased. Systemic blood pressure in the supine position was slightly decreased between 6 and 8 hours after drug intake but heart rate remained unaffected. Ramipril significantly increased brachial artery blood flow, brachial artery diameter and carotid artery blood flow and decreased forearm vascular resistance between 3 and 8 hours after drug administration. These peripheral arterial vasodilating effects were more marked in the muscular resistance vessels and affected both large arteries and arterioles in the brachial vascular territory. A correlation was found between the log of plasma concentrations of ramipril diacid metabolite and the drug-induced plasma ACE activity inhibition and increase in brachial artery blood flow. There was also a correlation between these 2 latter effects. A plasma ACE activity inhibition of 80% was required to induce significant increases in brachial artery blood flow and carotid artery blood flow.", 
    "279": "Ramipril (HOE 498) is a pro-drug of which the main metabolite (HOE 498 diacid or ramiprilat) is a potent angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. Thirteen healthy white volunteers (5 females and 8 males, ages 65 to 76 years) participated in a study to investigate the pharmacokinetics of HOE 498 in the elderly. After administration of 10 mg of HOE 498, sequential urine and serum specimens were obtained for assay of HOE 498 and metabolites (HOE 498-glucuronide, diacid, diacid-glucuronide, diketopiperazine and diketopiperazine acid). Side effects, clinical chemistry and hematology were monitored. HOE 498 reached peak concentrations of 62.4 +/- 23.3 ng/ml in serum after 0.7 +/- 0.3 hours. Serum levels decreased with an apparent half-life of 0.9 +/- 0.4 hours. The diacid was rapidly formed in serum, reaching peak concentrations of 40.6 +/- 14.0 ng/ml after 2.0 +/- 0.6 hours and declining with a half-life of 2.2 +/- 0.5 hours. A prolonged terminal phase of serum concentration versus time curve was observed at concentrations less than 1 ng/ml. The mean recovery of HOE 498 and metabolites in urine, up to 26 hours after administration, was 35 +/- 14% of the dose. The apparent half-lives, calculated from urine parameters, for HOE 498 and the diacid were 2.6 +/- 0.9 and 4.0 +/- 1.1 hours, respectively. The mean peak concentration and half-life of HOE 498 in serum are slightly higher in the elderly than in younger volunteers. Complete urinary collection was not possible, but urinary recovery did not seem different from younger volunteers.", 
    "280": "Ramipril is a potent orally active converting enzyme inhibitor. Its active metabolite ramiprilat is classified as a reversible, slow- and tight-binding inhibitor. Ramipril lowers blood pressure in various models of hypertension and improves states of acute cardiac failure mainly by suppression of angiotensin II formation. Actions on both vasoconstrictor and volume factors are involved because ramipril causes vasodilation and mild natriuresis but preserves potassium. Sustained inhibition of converting enzyme in target tissues such as vascular wall, kidney and heart may explain cardiovascular changes over the long term. Ancillary effects may possibly emerge from modulation of the sympathetic nervous system but the contribution of bradykinin potentiation remains unclear.", 
    "281": "Converting enzyme inhibitors are likely to be prescribed with increasing frequency in elderly patients. The pharmacokinetics of ramipril, a new potent long-acting non-sulphydryl converting enzyme inhibitor, and its effects on blood pressure, plasma renin activity and angiotensin II concentrations were studied in a group of 8 elderly volunteers (mean age 77, range 61 to 84). Circulating concentrations of the active diacid formed from its parent drug were consistently higher in this group despite apparently normal renal function, assessed by serum creatinine and urea concentrations, compared with younger volunteers (age range 21 to 30). The initial dose of ramipril should be lower in older subjects. The study emphasizes the importance of careful extrapolation of data obtained from young volunteers to older subjects.", 
    "282": "Ramipril is a long-acting non-sulphydryl converting enzyme inhibitor that requires cleavage of its ester group to form the active diacid metabolite, ramiprilat. Renal excretion largely determines the drug's duration of action and the dosage should be reduced in patients with renal impairment. Oral ramipril given daily at dosages of 5 mg or more can control blood pressure over a 24-hour period; lower doses may be effective in patients with heart failure inadequately controlled by diuretics alone. No serious idiosyncratic adverse reactions have been reported. Ramipril is one of the most potent long-acting converting enzyme inhibitors developed; it is effective given once daily in the treatment of all grades of hypertension and of heart failure.", 
    "283": "Local tissue renin-angiotensin systems have recently been discovered in various organs, and evidence is accumulating that inhibition of these local renin-angiotensin systems may contribute to the actions of converting enzyme (CE) inhibitors. Measurements of CE activity and angiotensin II concentrations revealed that after oral administration of CE inhibitors, CE was inhibited not only in lung vascular endothelium and blood, but also in the heart, kidney, vascular wall, brain and other organs. The functional significance of tissue CE inhibition is suggested first by the antihypertensive effect of brain CE inhibition in spontaneously hypertensive rats, second by the concomitant persistence of blood pressure decrease and CE inhibition in vascular wall and kidney after long-term oral CE inhibitor treatment and third by ex vivo experiments demonstrating marked effects of oral CE inhibitor pretreatment on cardiac function in isolated rat hearts. Local inhibition of tissue renin-angiotensin systems may be an important factor involved in the beneficial effects of CE inhibitors in such cardiovascular diseases as arterial hypertension, congestive heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias.", 
    "284": "Acute hemodynamic and hormonal responses to ramipril in comparison with captopril were studied in 10 patients with moderate to severe congestive heart failure in an open, randomized study. Both drugs were given to 5 patients each in 2 increasing doses on 2 successive days. After 5 mg of ramipril angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity was significantly decreased during 24 hours with a maximum decrease 4 hours after administration. Mean arterial blood pressure decreased from 84 +/- 5 to 62 +/- 5 mm Hg at 4 hours and 71 +/- 4 mm Hg at 12 hours, respectively, after this dose. Capillary wedge pressure decreased from 19 +/- 1 mm Hg to 13 +/- 1 mm Hg at 4 hours with a maximum increase in cardiac output from 3.8 +/- 0.3 liters/min to 4.4 +/- 0.3 liters/min at 2 hours. No significant cardiac effects were present 8 hours after administration. After 10 mg of ramipril, cardiac and hormonal effects showed a quicker onset of action and longer duration compared with the 5 mg dose. Mean arterial pressure decreased to 61 +/- 6 mm Hg. Similar effects were seen after captopril, but with a significantly shorter duration. Mean arterial pressure decreased from 82 +/- 4 mm Hg to 64 +/- 5 mm Hg after 12.5 mg and to 58 +/- 6 mm Hg after 25 mg of captopril. In patients with congestive heart failure ramipril has the hemodynamic profile of a long-acting and potent ACE inhibitor. Significant cardiac effects are present during 4 to 8 hours and ACE activity is still significantly inhibited 24 hours after a single dose of ramipril.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "285": "The response to ramipril, 10 and 20 mg on consecutive days, in 9 patients with severe (New York Heart Association functional class III or IV) chronic congestive heart failure was measured. Hemodynamic cannulae were placed more than 2 days before ramipril administration to ensure a stable baseline. Dietary sodium (40 mmol daily) and potassium (80 mmol daily) were constant before and during the study, and maintenance doses of digoxin and furosemide (80 to 1,000 mg daily) were continued unchanged. Ramipril induced pronounced, sustained decreases in angiotensin converting enzyme activity, angiotensin II and aldosterone levels, and a reciprocal increase in plasma renin activity. Plasma catecholamines, antidiuretic hormone and cortisol levels were not altered. Urinary sodium and potassium excretion diminished, plasma sodium decreased and plasma potassium increased. Plasma urea and creatinine levels increased. Ramipril treatment resulted in a decrease in systemic arterial pressure that was sustained for 24 hours, a decrease in heart rate and an increase in cardiac index, but little change in pulmonary artery pressure or right atrial pressure. Three patients were drowsy after ramipril administration, and 1 patient had a marked, temporary reduction in urine output. It was concluded that ramipril is a potent, long-acting angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitor that is likely to be beneficial in patients with severe cardiac failure.", 
    "286": "The hemodynamic effects of a single dose of 5 mg of ramipril, a new angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, were investigated in 10 patients with chronic congestive heart failure. Arterial blood pressure and total peripheral resistance were decreased by approximately 12% without causing reflex tachycardia. A highly significant decrease occurred in mean pulmonary artery and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures. These hemodynamic changes were equally pronounced at rest and during exercise on a bicycle ergometer; the effect was of the same magnitude 5 and 24 hours after medication. Angiotensin converting enzyme activity in plasma was nearly completely inhibited after 5 hours and remained at about 12% of control after 24 hours. Cardiac index, which was normal before treatment, remained unaffected. Thus, ramipril induced a balanced reduction of left ventricular pre- and afterload. The activity of the carotid sinus baroreflex was investigated in 8 of the patients using the neck suction technique before and 24 hours after ramipril. The reflex bradycardia during stimulation of the baroreceptors was significantly increased by ramipril, whereas the decrease in blood pressure remained essentially unaffected. Ramipril induced a selective sensitization of the parasympathetic baroreceptor heart rate reflex without influencing the sympathetically mediated peripheral vasodilatation. This effect may be responsible for the lack of reflex tachycardia in spite of the decrease in blood pressure.", 
    "287": "Ramipril is a newly synthesized angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor without a sulfhydryl group in the molecule but with a prolonged duration of action. Efficacy, tolerance and safety of this drug were evaluated in 10 patients with severe essential hypertension. After a treatment period of at least 4 weeks with the conventional antihypertensive drug combination of a diuretic and a beta-blocking agent with the vasodilator dihydralazine, their systolic and diastolic blood pressures averaged 161 +/- 6 and 111 +/- 2 mm Hg, respectively. Because diastolic blood pressure during this drug regimen was still greater than 105 mm Hg in all patients, the patients received ramipril initially at single daily doses of 5 mg in addition to their previous medication. The first dose of 5 mg ramipril resulted in a moderate but significant decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure in 9 of the 10 patients to 142 +/- 5 and 104 +/- 4 mm Hg (p less than 0.01), respectively, between 3 and 6 hours after drug administration. In 1 patient blood pressure was unresponsive to ramipril and 1 patient complained of nausea and vomiting within the first week of treatment with ramipril. Within the following 8-week treatment period with a once-daily intake of 5 or, if necessary, 10 mg of ramipril, diastolic blood pressure normalized in the remaining 8 patients to less than 90 mm Hg. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure averaged 130 +/- 5 and 83 +/- 2 mm Hg, respectively, at the end of the 8-week treatment period with ramipril. Severe hypotension and reflex tachycardia were not observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "288": "The converting enzyme inhibitor, ramipril, 20 mg once daily, was given to 3 hypertensive patients with unilateral renovascular disease. At 1 month, 24 hours after the last dose of ramipril, blood pressure, plasma angiotensin II and converting enzyme activity remained low, and active renin and angiotensin I high. There was no tendency for converting enzyme inhibition to be overcome during 1 month of ramipril therapy. Ramipril caused slight increases in serum potassium and urea, no change in serum creatinine and no consistent changes in the renal vein renin ratio. Ramipril caused little change in renal plasma flow on the stenotic side, but filtration fraction was reduced in 2 patients. There was no serious deterioration in total or individual glomerular filtration rate during ramipril therapy. The drug was well tolerated and there were no serious side effects. Ramipril, given once daily, is likely to be effective in controlling hypertension with renal artery stenosis.", 
    "289": "The effects of various dosage levels of ramipril on blood pressure were examined in a double-blind multicenter clinical trial. Patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension were first entered into a single-blind washout placebo phase of 4 weeks duration. The patients were then randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups and received either 1.25, 2.5 or 5 mg of ramipril orally once a day for 6 weeks. After 6 weeks of treatment, the diastolic blood pressure had been decreased by 16.0 mm Hg (53 patients), 16.5 mm Hg (54 patients) and 19.9 mm Hg (53 patients) for the 1.25, 2.5 and 5 mg groups, respectively. Systolic blood pressure had decreased by an average of 22.5 mm Hg independent of the dose administered. Diastolic blood pressure was decreased to less than or equal to 90 mm Hg in 64%, 63% and 77% of the patients in the 3 groups, respectively. The differences in these percentages among the groups were not statistically significant. The tolerability of the drug was good; discontinuation of treatment was necessary for 1 patient in the 1.25 mg group and medication was lowered for 2 patients because of adverse reactions. There were no clinically significant changes of any laboratory variables, except for an increase in uric acid serum levels.", 
    "290": "An open-label, prospective multicenter trial of ramipril was performed. The agent was administered once daily at an initial dosage of 1.25 mg and this was increased, when necessary, up to 10 mg with intervals of 2 weeks for 8 weeks. Effectiveness in 46 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension was 28.1% at a dosage of 1.25 mg, 52.2% at 2.5 mg, 69.6% at 5 mg and 78.3% at 10 mg of ramipril alone. In 27 patients receiving baseline therapy with a thiazide diuretic, a subsequent administration of ramipril showed effectiveness in 11.1% for 1.25 mg, 48.1% for 2.5 mg and 70.4% for 5 mg. Adverse effects occurred in 11.7% of patients overall and were not serious. One patient was withdrawn because of severe headache; the other patients tolerated the treatment well. A dosage of 2.5 to 10 mg of ramipril will probably be appropriate for further evaluation of the effectiveness of this agent in a double-blind study.", 
    "291": "The effects of 5 angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors--captopril, enalapril, perindopril, trandolapril and ramipril--on general and regional hemodynamics were investigated (using radioactive microspheres) and compared in anesthetized adult spontaneously hypertensive rats. The 5 treatments were administered daily by gavage for 8 days in doses inducing identical decreases in arterial blood pressure. This effect was entirely due to a decrease in total peripheral resistance inasmuch as cardiac index was not affected by the 5 ACE inhibitors. In addition, despite their different chemical structures, all exhibited the same regional vasodilator pattern, which thus appears to be related only to ACE inhibition. The vascular beds resistances were decreased in the following order: renal greater than splenic = liver greater than skin greater than total peripheral greater than muscle = brain. Simultaneously, and despite the decrease in perfusion pressure, most regional blood flows and especially renal blood flow were increased. Finally, renal vasodilator effects of ACE inhibitors were observed even after doses that lacked any effect on total peripheral resistance.", 
    "292": "The angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors ramipril and captopril were administered in doses of 10 mg once daily and 50 mg twice daily, respectively, to patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. After a 4-week single-blind placebo washout period, patients were treated for 12 weeks with 1 of the drugs under double-blind conditions. Patients who did not respond after 6 weeks of treatment were given 50 mg hydrochlorothiazide concomitantly. The ramipril group showed greater decreases in blood pressure compared with baseline values: 20.1/14.9 mm Hg (ramipril) compared with 16.5/13.5 mm Hg (captopril). A further 6 weeks of treatment lowered the blood pressure even more: 22.5/20.0 mm Hg (ramipril) compared with 20.5/18.6 mm Hg (captopril). Concomitant hydrochlorothiazide given to nonresponders reduced the blood pressure levels in 24 of 40 patients in the ramipril group and in 20 of 36 patients in the captopril group. At the end of the study the overall response to treatment with ramipril alone and ramipril plus hydrochlorothiazide was 77.1%. The overall response rate in the captopril group was 82.7%. No clinically relevant adverse reaction occurred in any patient. Ramipril given once daily was as effective as captopril given twice daily in lowering blood pressure. Both drugs proved to be safe during treatment for 12 weeks.", 
    "293": "In a randomized, double-blind trial, 2 doses of ramipril (2.5 and 5 mg once daily) were compared with placebo in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. A 2-week placebo run-in phase was followed by 4 weeks of treatment. Eighty-six patients entered the study and 17 withdrew during the course of the study. Both doses of ramipril appeared to be more effective than placebo in reducing blood pressure, but significant differences between 2.5 mg of ramipril and placebo were not found in any statistical analyses. In the endpoint analyses (taking the last measurement from each patient), the patients receiving 5 mg of ramipril had significantly larger decreases in blood pressure than the patients receiving placebo (t tests: standing systolic, p less than 0.001; supine diastolic, p less than 0.05; standing diastolic, p less than 0.05) and also than the patients receiving 2.5 mg of ramipril (standing systolic, p less than 0.05). It appears from the results of this study that the minimum effective dosage of ramipril is 5 mg once daily. No clinically relevant side effects or clinically relevant changes in laboratory values were observed.", 
    "294": "The immediate (0 to 24 hours) and long-term (4 weeks) hypotensive effects of a new long-acting angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, ramipril (HOE 498), as well as adverse effects and tolerance, were evaluated in 34 patients with primary hypertension. Further, effects on serum and urinary aldosterone and circulating angiotensin II concentrations were measured. After short- and long-term administration of 5 or 10 mg of ramipril, the mean blood pressure was significantly lowered compared with placebo. The mean maximum decrease in blood pressure was noted 4 to 8 hours after administration of ramipril once daily. Sustained blood pressure reduction was achieved after 4 weeks of treatment. Serum concentrations of aldosterone and plasma levels of circulating angiotensin II were reduced for up to 12 hours after drug intake, and tended to return to pretreatment levels at 24 hours. Serum angiotensin converting enzyme activity was markedly suppressed for more than 24 hours after a single dose of 5 or 10 mg ramipril. No subjective or objective adverse effects were noted, and the tolerance to the drug was very good.", 
    "295": "Studies were performed to examine the effect on forearm blood flow of local brachial artery infusions of angiotensin I, angiotensin II and of the converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril diacid (the active metabolite of ramipril). Acute infusions of both angiotensins produced dose-dependent decreases in blood flow (measured by venous occlusion plethysmography). To produce equivalent effects the dose of angiotensin I was 2 to 4 times that of angiotensin II. After ramipril diacid the response to angiotensin II was unchanged, while the dose of angiotensin I required to produce an equipotent response was increased 20-fold. Ramipril diacid given alone produced a small, nonsignificant increase in forearm flow, although the response was significantly related to basal plasma renin. The study confirms the presence of converting enzyme activity within human resistance vessels, and suggests that inhibition of converting enzyme, at sites other than the pulmonary vascular bed, might contribute to the hypotensive action of converting enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "296": "Fifteen patients with congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association III) were randomly assigned to treatment with either captopril or ramipril, a newly developed angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. Both groups were similar with respect to baseline hemodynamic measurements and plasma levels of norepinephrine, renin and vasopressin. The group receiving ramipril showed hemodynamic changes comparable to the group receiving captopril on the seventh day of treatment. The stroke volume index increased by 20% versus 21%, respectively, and the total peripheral resistance decreased by 13% versus 20%, respectively. The decrease in blood pressure and the tendency to decrease heart rate were similar in both groups. All patients had reactive hyperreninemia during therapy with the converting enzyme inhibitor. The resting elevated plasma norepinephrine decreased in both groups significantly, whereas vasopressin did not change. The hemodynamic improvement was more pronounced and comparable in both groups during exercise. Thus, ramipril is equally effective compared with captopril in the treatment of patients with severe congestive heart failure.", 
    "297": "The reduction of penicillamine disulfide by reductants in aqueous solutions has been studied and compared with that for captopril disulfide. Whereas near quantitative reduction for captopril disulfide was achieved with tributyl phosphine (200 mM), no detectable penicillamine was formed from penicillamine disulfide. Thiol reductants (25 mM) were, however, partially able to reduce penicillamine disulfide with the most effective agent being glutathione (15% reduction) following by dithioerythritol (8%) and cysteine (5.1%). The reduction of penicillamine-cysteine disulfide by glutathione was 6-fold higher than for penicillamine disulfide. Kinetic analysis showed that the initial rate of reduction and equilibrium constant for the reduction of penicillamine disulfides by glutathione were 267- and 875-fold less than for captopril disulfide at pH 7.4. Biotransformation studies in the cytosol fraction of rat blood cells demonstrated that whereas 48% of the reduction of captopril disulfide was enzyme-mediated only 19% of the penicillamine formed was enzyme-mediated for penicillamine disulfide. Accumulation of disulfides of penicillamine in patients taking penicillamine may therefore be a problem during chronic therapy.", 
    "298": "The principle of enzyme radioinhibitor binding displacement was developed to measure the concentration of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in rat serum. 125I MK351A, a tyrosyl derivative of enalaprilic acid, and a potent ACE inhibitor, bound in a concentration and time dependent manner to ACE. Binding of 125I MK351A to rat serum ACE was reduced in a concentration dependent manner in vitro by the ACE inhibitors MK521 (lisinopril), S9780, and Ro 31-3113-000 (Cilazapril diacid). This relationship was used to measure MK521 and S9780 in rat serum four hours after oral gavage with MK521, S9490-3 the prodrug ester of S9780, at 1, 2 and 4 mg/kg, or 1/2 hour after intraperitoneal injection of Ro 31-3113-000 (0.0125-0.7 mg/kg). Serum MK521 concentrations, estimated by radio inhibitor binding displacement, and radioimmunoassay, correlated well (r = 0.94, N = 9, P less than 0.001). Serum MK521, S9780 and Ro 31-3113-000 concentrations measured by radioinhibitor binding displacement assay were dose related, and inversely related to serum ACE enzymatic activity. The radioinhibitor binding displacement assay method using 125I MK351A as a ligand for ACE has application to the measurement of any competitive inhibitor of ACE.", 
    "299": "Dietary modification is an inefficient and calorically unwise means of preventing hypokalemia; potassium supplements present compliance problems and are of little or no use in the patient with a concomitant magnesium deficiency. Prescribing potassium-sparing diuretics is the best prevention-oriented choice, but diabetics and older patients must be monitored for signs of hyperkalemia, and it is generally better not to use these agents in patients who are also taking ACE inhibitors.", 
    "300": "The effects of i.v. captopril on regional blood flow (radioactive microspheres, 15 +/- 5 micron), hemodynamics and maximal oxygen consumption were evaluated in conscious rats with congestive heart failure due to large myocardial infarction (n = 9, infarct size 39.5 +/- 2% of left ventricle) and compared to data obtained from rats subjected to sham surgical procedures (n = 8). In both groups data were obtained at rest and during submaximal treadmill exercise during alternate infusion of captopril and saline. In the congestive heart failure group captopril reduced systemic vascular resistance, mean arterial pressure and left ventricular systolic pressure (P less than .05 each). Blood flow to the renal, gastrointestinal and coronary circulations was reduced in the heart failure group treated with saline vehicle. Flow to the renal and gastrointestinal beds of heart failure animals was enhanced to values similar to those observed in sham animals during captopril treatment. Left ventricular coronary flow was also increased significantly by captopril in both sham and heart failure animals. The most prominent effects of captopril occurred in the renal circulation of the heart failure group in which blood flow increased by 55%. Blood flow to skeletal muscle and skin was unchanged by captopril both in sham and heart failure animals at rest and during exercise. Maximal oxygen consumption was not affected by captopril treatment. Thus, captopril induced a differential pattern of vasodilation with the greatest effect in the renal bed and a less intensive effect in the gastrointestinal and coronary beds. The unchanged flow to skeletal muscle may explain the failure of captopril to improve exercise capacity after short-term administration.", 
    "301": "The effect of kallikrein and bradykinin on sperm motility was studied. For investigation of whether the effect is not temperature dependent, sperm motility and velocity were measured after incubation with kallikrein or bradykinin at different temperatures. The effect of kallikrein on sperm motility and velocity was demonstrated significantly at 22 degrees C. At 37 degrees C, this effect was absent, but with captopril the effect of kallikrein on sperm velocity was observed. Bradykinin stimulated sperm motility and velocity at 22 degrees C and at 33 degrees C. However, it did not stimulate sperm motility at 37 degrees C. With 1.10 phenantroline, the effect of bradykinin on sperm motility was detected. These results indicate that kallikrein and bradykinin stimulate sperm motility and velocity and that their effects are strongly temperature dependent.", 
    "302": "We investigated whether the pressor response to intravenous angiotensin II (ANG II) suppresses drinking. All experiments were done on conscious water-replete rats (200-400 g) with chronic vascular cannulas. Two rates of ANG II infusion (16.7 and 100 ng/min for 90 min) were tested; captopril (0.33 mg/min) was infused simultaneously to prevent endogenous production of ANG II. Both doses of ANG II increased mean arterial pressure (MAP) by 40-50 mmHg for the duration of the infusions, but water intakes were small. The drinking response was increased as much as fivefold, however, when the pressor response was reduced by injecting either isoproterenol (0.01 or 0.1 mg/kg, sc), diazoxide (20, 30, or 75 mg/kg, sc), or minoxidil (10 mg/kg, ip) 15 min after starting the ANG II infusion. The closer MAP was returned to normal, the greater was the drinking response. Since lowering MAP also reduced urinary water losses, net fluid intake increased even more dramatically. It is unlikely that the vasodilators directly stimulated thirst in the experiments because the dose of captopril used completely blocked drinking to these agents given alone. A situation of high circulating levels of ANG II but with MAP near or below normal more closely resembles physiological conditions of dehydration. Our results demonstrate that intravenous ANG II is a very potent dipsogen under these conditions.", 
    "303": "The cardiovascular effects of electrical stimulation of the posterior hypothalamus, intravenous administration of norepinephrine (NE), and direct sympathetic nerve stimulation (SNS) were compared in spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) given captopril (osmotic minipump, 1.25 micrograms/h icv) or vehicle for 4 wk beginning at age 7 wk. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and renal and mesenteric flows (pulsed Doppler flow probes) were monitored in anesthetized rats. Following chronic administration of captopril the MAP was 141 +/- 4 mmHg in SHR receiving captopril and 183 +/- 6 mmHg in SHR receiving vehicle. Posterior hypothalamic stimulation, intravenous NE, and SNS resulted in lesser increases in MAP and renal and mesenteric vascular resistances in SHR treated with captopril. Response curves were shifted to the right, and the initial slopes and rate of change of slopes of the curves were less in captopril-treated SHR than vehicle-treated rats. The decrease in sensitivity to posterior hypothalamic stimulation was greater than the decrease in response to NE or SNS. The decrease in vascular reactivity in captopril-treated SHR was not due to increased sensitivity of the baroreflex for control of vascular resistance nor to a decrease in arterial pressure per se. WKY treated with captopril also showed lesser increases in MAP and renal and mesenteric vascular resistances in response to posterior hypothalamic stimulation, intravenous NE, and SNS. The depressor effects of intracerebroventricular captopril in SHR may be due, in part, to an attenuation in sympathetic vasoconstrictor tone. This attenuation involves both a decrease in vascular smooth muscle responsiveness to NE as well as a decrease in central stimulation of sympathetic outflow.", 
    "304": "Cyclosporine-induced nephrotoxicity (CIN) was studied in rats treated for 7 days with cyclosporine (10 mg x kg-1 x day-1 im) or vehicle (CON). CIN rats displayed characteristic reductions in glomerular filtration (GFR) and renal blood blood flow (RBF), and electron microscopy showed injury to proximal cells. Metabolic studies (7 day) showed significantly lower renal sodium excretion in conscious CIN rats compared with CON. In anesthetized rats at similar blood pressures, nephron GFR (SNGFR) was lower in CIN than CON, but fractional Na reabsorption was similar. In CIN, SNGFR, measured proximally to block flow to the sensing site of tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) at the macula densa, was not significantly different than distal SNGFR. The rate of distal fluid delivery was significantly lower in CIN than in CON. Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) with captopril (CAP, 10 mg/kg iv), or saralasin (SAR, 0.3 mg x kg-1 x h-1 iv) caused marked arterial hypotension in CIN and a fall in renal vascular resistance (RVR). With arterial pressure controlled, CAP or SAR increased GFR and RBF, and reduced RVR in CIN, but did not reverse the renal deficits compared with similarly treated CON. RBF autoregulation in CIN was impaired between 90 and 140 mmHg but was partially restored by CAP. We conclude that both the filtered load and excretion rate of sodium in CIN are significantly reduced compared with controls, that SNGFR in CIN is not depressed by TGF in response to elevated distal fluid delivery, and that the RAS is not a primarily mediator of the renal vasoconstriction in CIN.", 
    "305": "To determine the effects of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system on development of tolerance and fluid retention in patients with chronic congestive heart failure during long-term prazosin treatment, plasma renin concentration, aldosterone, norepinephrine and maximal exercise tolerance were measured during chronic therapy with digitalis and diuretics, to which prazosin, captopril or a combination of both drugs was added. Plasma renin concentration and aldosterone level decreased slightly during prazosin therapy and norepinephrine level increased significantly. When captopril was given, plasma renin concentration increased as expected, aldosterone level normalized and norepinephrine level decreased significantly. When prazosin was added to captopril therapy, norepinephrine level increased and plasma renin concentration and aldosterone level did not change. Exercise capacity did not increase during prazosin treatment, but was increased with captopril treatment. Prazosin treatment was associated with an increase in body weight even though the dose of furosemide was increased. Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system did not prevent fluid retention induced by prazosin during combination therapy. These findings suggest that the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is not substantially involved in development of tolerance and fluid retention during prazosin therapy; stimulation of plasma norepinephrine may be of decisive importance.", 
    "306": "The stability of captopril in aqueous solution at 32 degrees C was studied in the pH range 6.6 to 8.0 under controlled oxygen partial pressure (90-760 mm Hg) with and without the addition of cupric ion. The oxidation product, captopril disulfide, was found to be the sole degradation product. A change in reaction rate from first order to zero order occurs as the captopril concentration decreases. The concentration at which this transition takes place is a function of the pH, oxygen partial pressure, and cupric ion concentration. The apparent first-order rate constants show a first-order dependency on both the oxygen partial pressure and the cupric ion concentration. However, the apparent zero-order rate constants show a first-order dependency on oxygen partial pressure and a second-order dependency on cupric ion concentration. As the pH increases from 6.6 to 8.0, the first-order process becomes more predominant. A mechanism which consists of cupric ion- and molecular oxygen-catalyzed oxidation is proposed to explain those observations.", 
    "307": "The present studies were designed to investigate further the mechanism by which water intake is induced in rats by peripheral administration of either serotonin (5HT) or its precursor 5-hydroxytryptophan (5HTP). Consistent with previous studies that have implicated mediation by the renal renin-angiotensin system (RAS), we now report that bilateral nephrectomy completely abolishes the drinking response to various doses of 5HT. In contrast, nephrectomy had little effect on the drinking induced by 5HTP. Thus, 5HTP may induce drinking by mechanisms other than its peripheral conversion to 5HT and subsequent activation of the RAS. The drinking responses to both 5HT and 5HTP were blocked by peripheral administration of the 5HT receptor antagonist, metergoline, but the drug was at least ten-fold more potent against 5HTP than 5HT. Intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of metergoline also prevented the drinking response to peripherally-administered 5HTP. The drinking responses to both 5HT and 5HTP were enhanced by peripheral administration of low doses of an angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril. Collectively, these findings support previous conclusions that 5HT-induced intake of water is mediated exclusively by the renal RAS. However, 5HTP-induced drinking may additionally involve a renin-independent, serotonin-mediated mechanism, possibly in the brain.", 
    "308": "Cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK 8) produced significant antinociception in the tail immersion test in the rat, paw pressure test in the rat and acetylcholine-induced writhing test in the mouse after subcutaneous (s.c.) administration. In the hot plate test, CCK 8 (s.c.) showed antinociceptive activity if the latency to lick was used as the end point but if the latency to jump was recorded the antinociceptive effects were not evident. Cholecystokinin tetrapeptide (CCK 4) was shown to be antinociceptive in the writhing but not in the hot plate test after subcutaneous administration and appeared to be less potent than CCK 8 when tested under the same conditions. Antinociception induced by CCK 8 in the hot plate test (lick) could also be demonstrated after direct intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection and this observation was also made with the CCK-related peptide FMRF amide. Antinociception induced by CCK 8 (which did not appear to be associated with reduced locomotor activity) was evident 5 min after intraventricular injection and was maximal at 10 min, the effect lasting over a 30-45 min period. The antinociceptive effect of CCK 8 was antagonised by naloxone and was potentiated by simultaneous administration of the peptidase inhibitors bestatin, thiorphan and captopril.", 
    "309": "In experimental animals, a high protein diet has been shown to accelerate end-stage renal disease by inducing glomerular hyperperfusion. In this study, we found that intravenous administration of amino acid, used as one component of parenteral nutrition, to normal volunteers resulted in a significant increase in renal blood flow (from 517 +/- 29 to 754 +/- 60 ml/min) and glomerular filtration rate (from 106 +/- 6 to 165 +/- 12 ml/min) without altering systemic blood pressure, renal excretion of electrolytes, plasma renin activity, or plasma aldosterone concentration, and excretory rates of prostaglandins E2 were increased (from 665 +/- 61 to 1,034 +/- 153 pg/min). These amino acid-induced renal hemodynamic effects were abolished when the volunteers received a low sodium diet (20 mEq/day) for three days before the amino acid infusions. However, the hemodynamic effects were restored when the subjects receiving low sodium diets were pretreated with captopril. Under these conditions, amino acid infusions increased renal blood flow (from 388 +/- 11 to 597 +/- 27 ml/min) and glomerular filtration rate (from 80 +/- 4 to 118 +/- 9 ml/min). Reduction of prostaglandin synthesis with indomethacin in volunteers receiving a normal sodium intake was also capable of significantly decreasing the amino acid effects on renal hemodynamics. The results indicate that the renal hemodynamic effects of amino acid infusion are strongly influenced by angiotensin II and prostaglandin formation.", 
    "310": "Hypotensive effects of SA446, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, and effects on the renin-angiotensin system were evaluated in conscious normotensive and 2-kidney, 1-clip renal hypertensive dogs. SA446 (1 mg/kg, p.o.) remarkably inhibited the pressor response to angiotensin (Ang) I between 1 and 6 hr after the administration in normotensive dogs. SA446 significantly decreased blood pressure at 10 mg/kg, p.o., in normotensive dogs. During repeated administration of SA446 (100 mg/kg/day, p.o.) for 13 weeks, the blood pressure was lowered, and the pressor response to Ang I and plasma ACE activity were strongly inhibited. ACE activities in the aorta and kidney were also inhibited. Plasma renin activity and plasma Ang I concentration increased by repeated SA446 application, while plasma aldosterone concentration decreased. The hypotensive effect of SA446 (5 mg/kg, p.o.) was more potent in 2-kidney, 1-clip renal hypertensive dogs than in normotensive dogs. SA446 had longer inhibitory effects on the pressor response to Ang I and more potent hypotensive effects than captopril. The hypotension caused by SA446 appears to be associated mainly with an inhibition of ACE in plasma and also in the vascular wall.", 
    "311": "The possible role of the vascular angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in the development of two-kidney, one clip (2-K, 1C) hypertensive dogs was studied in different blood vessels. Vascular ACE activity per mg protein differed in a variety of blood vessels; the activity appeared to vary inversely with the outer diameter of arteries. The systemic blood pressure in mongrel dogs increased after partial occlusion of the left renal artery, and the hypertension lasted for 8 months. Plasma renin activity (PRA) was raised only for the first 4 weeks after the operation and then returned to the original level in the chronic stage of hypertension. Plasma ACE activity did not alter during the experimental period. In contrast, ACE activities in the jejunal, pulmonary and renal arteries, aorta, lung and cerebral cortex, significantly increased in the chronic hypertensive stage (8 months after occlusion). The production of angiotensin II (ANG II) from ANG I was significantly greater in isolated arteries from 8-month hypertensive dogs than in those from normotensive dogs when assessed by the contractile responses to ANG I and ANG II. These results indicate that acceleration by increased vascular ACE activity of the production of ANG II in the vascular wall may contribute to the maintenance of hypertension in the chronic stage of 2-K, 1C hypertensive dogs having normal PRA and plasma ACE activity.", 
    "312": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity in human plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), was measured by a fluorimetric method, following an acute oral dose (75 mg) of captopril. A decrease of approximately 60% in enzyme activity was observed in CSF, suggesting that the drug penetrates the blood/brain barrier (BBB) in sufficient amounts to inhibit the ACE in CSF. The activity of CSF enkephalinase, an enzyme present in human brain and inhibited in vitro by an elevated concentration of captopril, was, however, unaffected by the acute drug administration. It is proposed that the antihypertensive effect of captopril in humans may be due, at least in part, to the inhibition of ACE contained within brain structures.", 
    "313": "Experiments were performed in 14 anesthetized dogs to (1) to determine if the reductions in hindlimb blood flow produced by [des-Asp1] angiotensin I were due to its local enzymatic (kininase II) conversion to angiotensin III and (2) to quantitate the extent of conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II and of [des-Asp1] angiotensin I to angiotensin III in the hindlimb circulation. Graded doses of these peptides were administered as bolus injections directly into the left external iliac artery while measuring flow in this artery electromagnetically. Dose-response relationships were determined before and during the inhibition of kininase II activity with captopril or antagonism of angiotensin receptor sites with [Ile7] angiotensin III. Captopril inhibited the vasoconstrictor responses to angiotensin I and [des-Asp1] angiotensin I, but did not affect the responses to angiotensins II or III, or norepinephrine. [Ile7] angiotensin III inhibited the vasoconstrictor responses to all four angiotensin peptides but did not alter the responses to norepinephrine. These findings indicate that the hindlimb vasoconstrictor responses to [des-Asp1] angiotensin I were due to the local formation of angiotensin III. The extent of conversion of [des-Asp1] angiotensin I to angiotensin III that occurred in one transit through the hindlimb arterial circulation was estimated to be 36.7%, which was not different from the estimated 36.4% conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. We conclude that angiotensin I and [des-Asp1] angiotensin I are converted to their respective vasoactive forms (angiotensins II and III) to a similar extent in the hindlimb circulation via the action of kininase II.", 
    "314": "Neuropeptide-Y (NPY) acutely enhanced the plasma concentration of aldosterone (but not that of corticosterone) in both normal animals and in rats whose hypothalamo-hypophyseal axis and renin-angiotensin system were pharmacologically interrupted. The maximal response was obtained with a dose of 150 micrograms/kg. This dose of NPY raised the activity of 11 beta-hydroxylase and 18-hydroxylase in the capsular adrenal (zona glomerulosa), but not that of 11 beta-hydroxylase in the inner adrenocortical layers (zonae fasciculata and reticularis). These findings seem to indicate that NPY is specifically and directly involved in the acute stimulation of the late steps of the secretory activity of the rat zona glomerulosa.", 
    "315": "The antihypertensive activity of SCH 33844, a new angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, was investigated in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats during a 3-week treatment regimen and for 1 week following drug withdrawal. SCH 33844 was given once daily at 2 dose levels (1 and 5 mg/kg orally) and its effects were compared with those of captopril (60 mg/kg orally). Systolic blood pressure was recorded twice weekly just before administration and at varying time intervals up to 6 hr after dosing; recordings were continued for 1 week after drug withdrawal. SCH 33844 was found to produce dose-related antihypertensive effects. Given at 1 mg/kg, the compound elicited small but significant blood pressure changes during the treatment. After drug withdrawal, systolic blood pressure returned to pre-drug levels within 1 week. SCH 33844 at 5 mg/kg, and captopril at 60 mg/kg, both reduced blood pressure markedly and to a similar extent. After each administration the effect was rapid in onset, lasted for over 6 hr and was not subject to tolerance. Drug withdrawal resulted in a gradual return of systolic blood pressure toward pre-treatment levels within 1 week, with no evidence of rebound phenomena. These results indicate that SCH 33844, like captopril, produces an effective antihypertensive action throughout a repeated dosing.", 
    "316": "SCH 33844 is a new non-sulfhydryl-containing angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. SCH 33844 diacid inhibited hydrolysis of the synthetic substrate hippuryl-histidyl-leucine by rabbit lung ACE in vitro with an IC50 (concentration inhibiting enzyme by 50%) of 0.81 nM. The ester was 83 times less active. Intravenous administration of SCH 33844 and its diacid inhibited pressor responses to angiotensin I (AI) in anesthetized rats with calculated ID50's of 16 and 8 micrograms/kg, respectively. Oral administration of SCH 33844 (0.03-1 mg/kg) inhibited AI pressor responses in conscious rats with a duration of 24 hr at the highest dose. The diacid was inactive. Intravenous administration of SCH 33844 (100-1000 micrograms/kg) or its diacid (30 micrograms/kg) to anesthetized dogs inhibited AI pressor activity and potentiated the depressor response to bradykinin. SCH 33844 inhibited AI responses in conscious dogs following oral administration of 0.3-3 mg/kg. Oral administration of SCH 33844 (1 mg/kg) to conscious monkeys inhibited AI pressor responses for the 4 hr duration of study. In conclusion, SCH 33844 is a potent, orally effective ACE inhibitor in rats, dogs and monkeys.", 
    "317": "Compared to many forms of hypertension, vascular reactivity to angiotensin II (AII) is decreased in the early phase of two-kidney, one clip (2-K, 1C) renovascular hypertension (RVH). To determine the role of the AII receptor, we examined vascular responsiveness and 125I-AII binding to mesenteric artery membrane fractions after three weeks of 2-K, 1C RVH. Systolic blood pressure was 165 +/- 8 in RVH and 105 +/- 4 mm Hg in controls, P less than 0.001. Plasma renin activity was 4.2 +/- 0.6 in RVH and 1.4 +/- 0.5 ng AI/ml/hr in controls, P less than .001. The pressor response to exogenous AII was reduced by 40% in RVH. Since administration of a single dose of converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI) did not normalize the response to exogenous AII, the decreased reactivity was not caused by receptor occupancy. 125I-AII binding to mesenteric arteries was equal to or greater in RVH than controls at all concentrations of AII. Scatchard analysis revealed an increase in the total number of binding sites (BMAX): 140.8 +/- 6.3 in RVH versus 91.7 +/- 6.5 fmol/mg in controls, P less than 0.01, while the apparent dissociation constant was unchanged. To determine if the increase in circulating AII caused these binding alterations, rats were either treated with CEI for three days; or unilaterally nephrectomized. Both of these manipulations reversed the decrease in vascular responsiveness as well as the increase in receptor number (BMAX = 136 +/- 13.4 in RVH vs. 94 +/- 9.4 fmol/mg in RVH + nephrectomy, P less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "321": "The pharmacokinetics of the converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril, were studied in an open, randomized, balanced crossover design in 12 hospitalized patients with stable, chronic congestive heart failure (CHF). Enalapril maleate is a prodrug requiring in vivo hepatic esterolysis to yield the active diacid inhibitor enalaprilat. CHF results in changes in regional blood flow that may affect the gastrointestinal absorption, hepatic hydrolysis and renal excretion of enalapril and enalaprilat. In order to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of enalapril in CHF, the following treatments were given: enalapril maleate 10 mg orally, enalapril maleate 5 mg intravenously and enalaprilat 5 mg intravenously. Each dose was followed by a 72 h period with frequent blood sampling and fractionated urine collection for the radioimmunoassay of enalaprilat, before and after sample hydrolysis. Mean absorption for the oral dose was 69%, hydrolysis 55%, bioavailability 38%, urinary recovery 77% and estimated first-pass effect 10%. The results were compared with available data in normal subjects. After oral administration of 10 mg enalapril maleate, the extent of absorption, the degree of hydrolysis and the bioavailability in CHF patients appear to be similar to those in normals with differences less than 10%. The rate of absorption and hydrolysis appear to be slightly slower in CHF. The serum concentrations of enalaprilat were consistently greater in CHF and maximal concentrations were reached at 6 h in CHF as compared to 4 h in normal subjects. We conclude that the presence of CHF does not appreciably alter the pharmacokinetic behaviour of enalapril. The observed differences may be associated with age as well as the disease state.", 
    "322": "To investigate the morphologic correlates of decreased renal blood flow and growth arrest resulting from chronic partial ureteral obstruction in the neonate, guinea pigs were subjected to unilateral ureteral constriction within the first 2 days of life and were studied at 3 and 8 wk of age. Severity of histologic changes in the obstructed and intact contralateral kidney was assessed by light microscopy. Morphometric glomerular measurements were made using a computerized tracing device. Since contralateral nephrectomy or administration of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril) result in increased blood flow to the obstructed kidney, morphologic changes were also examined in separate groups of animals subjected to these maneuvers, and were compared to appropriate controls. Ipsilateral chronic partial ureteral obstruction resulted in decreased glomerular volume (p less than 0.0001) and increased glomerular crowding associated with tubular dilatation and progressive glomerular sclerosis, tubular atrophy, and interstitial fibrosis. The intact contralateral kidney underwent hypertrophy with increase in glomerular volume (p less than 0.0001) and decreased glomerular density. Contralateral nephrectomy prevented the decrease in glomerular volume in the obstructed kidney and resulted in decreased glomerular density and reduced tubular atrophy at 3 wk of age. Enalapril prevented the decrease in glomerular volume at 3 wk of age, but glomerular and tubular changes progressed and were unaffected by enalapril at 8 wk. Left kidney glomerular volume was directly related to renal blood flow (r = 0.71, p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "323": "The thiol moiety is prone to oxidative free radical formation, which may be important in mediating the toxicity of some thiol-containing compounds. The oxidation of the compounds cysteine, cysteamine, N-acetylcysteine, glutathione, penicillamine, and captopril were studied using ESR and oxygen uptake techniques. Lactoperoxidase, with hydrogen peroxide to provide oxidizing equivalents, was used to initiate the oxidation. The reaction appears to be strongly peroxide dependent, with either exogenous H2O2 or thiol-derived peroxide driving the reaction.", 
    "324": "Renin secretion was stimulated in rats by adrenalectomy (ADX), by treatment with the converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril (MK 421), or by feeding a low salt diet plus furosemide treatment (FUR). Relative amounts of renin mRNA were measured by densitometric Northern blot analysis using a 32P-labeled 700 bp mouse submaxillary gland cDNA fragment as hybridization probe. Renin secretion was measured in isolated kidneys taken from pretreated rats. Treatment resulted in a 4.4-, 7- and 12.7-fold increase in total renin mRNA in kidneys of ADX, MK 421 and FUR rats, respectively. Plasma renin levels increased 5-, 9- and 12-fold in ADX, MK 421 and FUR rats, whereas ex vivo secretion rates from the isolated kidney were 4.7-, 0.5- and 4.2-fold, respectively, that of controls. Thus, a close relationship between increases in renin secretion in vivo (reflected by plasma renin concentration) and renin mRNA exists, whereas secretion rates in the isolated perfused kidney ex vivo change in a non-proportional fashion.", 
    "325": "In vivo generation of angiotensins depends upon both plasma renin and angiotensinogen concentrations. Those factors which may influence hepatic angiotensinogen synthesis and release were examined. We have evaluated in vivo the effects of converting enzyme inhibition on several plasma renin-angiotensin system components, and, using an in vitro preparation of liver slices, we also investigated the effects of converting enzyme inhibition on the synthesis and release of hepatic angiotensinogen. Angiotensinogen concentrations were determined by two different methods. The first was an indirect enzymatic assay which measures the amount of angiotensin I liberated from plasma by an excess of renin. The second was a direct RIA that measures both angiotensinogen and its inactive residue the des-angiotensin I-angiotensinogen. The difference between the methods represents the circulating levels of des-angiotensin I-angiotensinogen. Captopril administration in sodium-depleted rats increased plasma concentrations of renin, des-angiotensin I-angiotensinogen, and angiotensin I and decreased plasma angiotensinogen concentration measured by both methods. Plasma des-angiotensin I-angiotensinogen was significantly correlated to plasma renin concentration, which suggests an increase in the consumption of angiotensinogen when the renin secretion is extremely increased. The angiotensinogen liver content and in vitro angiotensinogen release were decreased in sodium-depleted rats treated with a converting enzyme inhibitor, and these parameters were negatively correlated to in vivo plasma levels of renin, angiotensin I, and des-angiotensin I-angiotensinogen. They were positively correlated to plasma angiotensinogen concentration measured by the indirect assay. These data suggest that captopril administration during sodium depletion has two simultaneous effects: it increases angiotensinogen consumption and second, decreases angiotensinogen production and release.", 
    "326": "We describe a simple, rapid, specific radioenzymatic assay for \"CGS 16617,\" a new, potent inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE; EC 3.4.15.1) in human plasma. This assay is based on the principle that the inhibitor (i.e., the drug) binds to the ACE in plasma and hence the amount of free ACE in plasma is inversely related to the amount of active inhibitor present. Free enzyme is reacted with a radiolabeled substrate, and the radioactive product is selectively extracted into the scintillation cocktail for quantification. Fivefold-diluted plasma samples are incubated with [3H]hippuryl-glycyl-glycine enzyme substrate at 37 degrees C for 30 min and the liberated [3H]hippuric acid is selectively extracted into scintillation cocktail. The radioactivity is counted in a liquid scintillation counter. Both within-run and between-run, the variability (CV) of the assay is less than 10%. As little as 200 ng of the drug per liter can be quantified in 50-microL plasma samples. The method can also be used to assay two other ACE inhibitors, pentopril and CGS 14831, demonstrating that the method can be readily adapted to any ACE inhibitor having a single active component in plasma. The ester prodrug pentopril can also be assayed after ester hydrolysis. This method is suitable for analysis of large numbers of samples in clinical laboratories for routine monitoring of the concentrations of active ACE inhibitors in blood.", 
    "327": "The suggested harmful effect of dietary protein on renal function in diabetic nephropathy was tested in three groups of insulin-dependent diabetic patients: 1) 10 patients without signs of nephropathy in spite of at least 30 years of diabetes; 2) 11 patients with nephropathy and reduced but stable glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (decline less than 4 ml/min per year [mean 1.8] during the last 2 years); 3) 10 patients with progressive nephropathy with GFR declining by an average of 11 ml/min per year. Dietary protein intake was estimated from a dietary history interview, as well as from urinary excretion of nitrogen (mean = 4.7 samples). Both methods showed a wide range of protein intake in all three groups of patients (0.6-2.3 g/kg body weight [BW]). The mean values did not differ between the groups, 1.30, 1.34, and 1.24 g/kg BW by interview, and 1.20, 1.10, and 1.13 g based on urinary nitrogen levels. There was no correlation between rate of decline of GFR and protein intake, even in those patients with no or minimal decline. These results do not support the hypothesis that dietary protein is a factor of importance in the development or progression of human diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "328": "Angiotensin II (ANG II) reversibly depolarizes renin-containing juxtaglomerular epithelioid cells (JGECs) of the hydronephrotic mouse kidney afferent arteriole. This depolarizing response was utilized to assess changes in ANG II concentration in the vicinity of JGECs in order to test whether ANG II is generated from ANG I and artificial renin substrate (ARS) in this preparation. Depolarizations were also produced by the application of ANG I and ARS in the superfusing medium. These responses to ANG I and ARS were completely blocked by saralasin. Hence, our findings are indicative for an intrarenal, local generation of ANG II. As opposed to saralasin, several converting enzyme and renin inhibitors only diminished but generally did not abolish the actions of ANG I and ARS, respectively. These results suggest an alternative, nonrenin and non-converting enzyme-dependent pathway of ANG II generation in renal tissue.", 
    "329": "The hypothesis that the vasoconstrictor action of vasopressin may contribute to the development of hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) was tested by chronic infusion of a specific antagonist of the vascular effects of vasopressin. From 4 to 13 weeks of age, SHR and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) received subcutaneously either isotonic saline or the vasopressin pressor antagonist, d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)arginine vasopressin by osmopump. Systolic blood pressure was measured by tail cuff from 5 to 11 weeks of age. In SHR, the vasopressin analogue did not alter the rate or magnitude of increase in systolic blood pressure. In WKY, systolic blood pressure in the vasopressin analogue group was slightly reduced compared with the saline infusion values until 10 weeks of age (F1, 10 = 10.18, p = 0.008). At 12 to 14 weeks of age, all animals were prepared with indwelling arterial and venous catheters. Resting mean arterial pressure was not altered significantly by the vasopressin analogue infusion in either strain, but the response to an acute vasopressin infusion of 5, 15, or 50 ng/kg body weight was markedly attenuated by the analogue treatment, indicating that plasma levels of the vasopressin analogue were sufficient to block pressor effects of endogenous vasopressin. A bolus injection of the angiotensin II converting enzyme inhibitor teprotide (SQ 20881) resulted in a decrease in mean arterial pressure (p less than 0.05) that was comparable in all groups, and serum renin concentration was not elevated in the vasopressin analogue-treated rat.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "330": "SCH 33844 is a new, potent and long-acting inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). Antihypertensive, hemodynamic and autonomic actions of SCH 33844 were examined in the present series of experiments. Oral administration of 0.3-30 mg/kg reduced blood pressure of spontaneously hypertensive rats. The magnitude of the response was significantly enhanced by pretreatment of the animals with hydrochlorothiazide. Blood pressure remained significantly depressed 24 hr following doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg. Administration of SCH 33844 (3 mg/kg) twice daily to nonpretreated rats or once daily to diuretic-pretreated animals for 5 days resulted in a progressive decrease in blood pressure. The compound did not reduce blood pressure in nephrectomized rats demonstrating the dependence of its action on renal renin. SCH 33844 (1-10 mg/kg orally) also produced dose-related decreases in pressure in diuretic-pretreated conscious normotensive dogs. However, only a small fall in pressure occurred in non-pretreated dogs. Hemodynamic actions were examined in anesthetized dogs. SCH 33844 (1 mg/kg i.v.) reduced blood pressure, increased cardiac output and caused a large fall in peripheral resistance. Autonomic actions were assessed in pithed rats. The compound (10 mg/kg orally) tended to decrease pressor responses to sympathetic activation and to i.v. norepinephrine. This profile is probably due, at least in part, to vasorelaxation following suppression of angiotensin II generation. In conclusion, SCH 33844 is a potent, long-lasting antihypertensive agent which reduces peripheral vascular resistance and possesses only slight autonomic effects.", 
    "331": "Older patients with both hypertension and pulmonary disease pose a challenge to the physician. Satisfactory blood-pressure control must be achieved without exacerbating the concomitant pulmonary disease. Diuretics may interfere with mucus production and cause acid-base and electrolyte abnormalities. The beta-adrenergic blocking agents should be avoided because of their risk of inducing bronchospasm. If a beta blocker must be used, it should be combined with an alpha- and beta-adrenergic blocker, or an agent with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity or beta 1 selectivity. The direct and indirect vasodilators may be used safely in these patients, but the risk of worsening any underlying coronary artery disease must be kept in mind when prescribing either hydralazine or minoxidil. The calcium channel blockers and ACE-inhibitors have the best safety record in treating the elderly who have hypertension and COPD. For these patients, the calcium channel blockers offer the advantage of simultaneous therapy of coronary artery disease, whereas hypertensive patients with congestive heart failure would be more likely to benefit from an ACE-inhibitor. The ability to treat hypertension without precipitating unwanted adverse reactions or dangerous side effects is one of the arts of medicine. Fortunately, the range of drugs available to today's physician allows safe and efficacious treatment of the elderly patient who has both hypertension and pulmonary disease.", 
    "332": "Stimulation of glutamate binding by the dipeptide L-phenylalanyl-L-glutamate (Phe-Glu) was inhibited by the peptidase inhibitor bestatin, suggesting that the stimulation was caused by glutamate liberated from the dipeptide and not by the dipeptide itself. It further suggests that this form of glutamate binding should be reinterpreted as glutamate sequestration and that stimulation of binding both by dipeptides and after preincubation with high concentrations of glutamate is likely to be due to counterflow accumulation. Several other criteria indicate that most of glutamate binding stimulated by chloride represents glutamate sequestration: Binding is reduced when the osmolarity of the incubation medium is increased, when membranes incubated with [3H]glutamate are lysed before filtration, and when membranes are made permeable by transient exposure to saponin. Moreover, dissociation of bound glutamate after a 100-fold dilution of the incubation medium is accelerated about 50 times by the addition of glutamate to the dilution medium. This result would be anomalous if glutamate were bound to a receptor site; it suggests instead that glutamate is transported in and out of membrane vesicles by a transport system that preferentially mediates exchange between internal and external glutamate. Glutamate binding contains a component of glutamate sequestration even when measured in the absence of chloride. Sequestration is adequately abolished only after treating membranes with detergents; even extensive lysis, sonication, and freezing/thawing may be insufficient.", 
    "333": "Previous structure-activity studies of captopril and related active angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have led to the conclusion that the basic structural requirements for inhibition of ACE involve (a) a terminal carboxyl group; (b) an amido carbonyl group; and (c) different types of effective zinc (Zn) ligand functional groups. Such structural requirements common to a set of compounds acting at the same receptor have been used to define a pharmacophoric pattern of atoms or groups of atoms mutually oriented in space that is necessary for ACE inhibition from a stereochemical point of view. A unique pharmacophore model (within the resolution of approximately 0.15 A) was observed using a method for systematic search of the conformational hyperspace available to the 28 structurally different molecules under study. The method does not assume a common molecular framework, and, therefore, allows comparison of different compounds that is independent of their absolute orientation. Consequently, by placing the carboxyl binding group, the binding site for amido carbonyl, and the Zn atom site in positions determined by ideal binding geometry with the inhibitors' functional groups, it was possible to clearly specify a geometry for the active site of ACE.", 
    "334": "1. The pharmacokinetics of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition in plasma and tissues were measured in the rat following 10 mg/kg lisinopril given by oral gavage. 2. Specific binding of 125I-351A to ACE was measured in plasma, and homogenates of lung, aorta, kidney, testis, epididymis and brain, and used as an index of ACE activity. 3. Plasma ACE binding of 125I-351A was reduced to 5% of that in untreated rats 2 h after treatment, and returned to normal by 48 h. Kidney ACE showed a similar time course. Angiotensin converting enzyme from lung, aorta and brain was inhibited at a slower rate, and to a lesser degree. No significant inhibition of ACE was detected in epididymis or testis. 4. Individual tissues in the rat had differences in time course and degree of ACE inhibition after a single dose of lisinopril.", 
    "335": "1. The influence of two angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, captopril and enalapril, on the cAMP content of microdissected brain areas was examined in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Both drugs depleted systolic arterial blood pressure significantly. 2. Captopril and enalapril increased the level of cAMP in catecholaminergic cell groups in the lower brain-stem. Captopril was more effective in the substantia nigra, while enalapril treatment resulted in high cAMP levels in the ventrolateral medulla oblongata (A1 catecholaminergic cell group). 3. Both drugs, especially captopril, depleted cAMP content in the cingulate cortex. 4. No changes in cAMP levels were measured in the primary baroreceptor centre (nucleus of the solitary tract) following either captopril or enalapril treatment.", 
    "336": "There have recently been reports of persistent cough and increased broncho-obstruction likely to have been induced by ACE inhibitors. In order to study the effect of MK 422 (the active parent diacid of enalapril) on the inflammatory response, ovalbumin-sensitized guinea-pigs were tested intradermally with ovalbumin, capsaicin and bradykinin. All inflammatory responses were enhanced by treatment with MK 422 for 2 days prior to testing as compared to the responses of control animals. Infiltration of neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils and monocytes was increased following ovalbumin challenge in the MK 422-treated animals. We suggest that skin reactions and airway symptoms noticed during ACE inhibitor therapy might have been due to induced or potentiated inflammatory reactions in the skin or in the bronchial wall.", 
    "337": "Antihypertensive treatment reduces the risk of ischemic strokes and cerebral hemorrhage as complications of excessive or long-standing hypertension. However, neurologic dysfunction and brain damage may also accompany short-term, and under certain conditions, even long-term antihypertensive treatment. Therefore, treatment should be instituted restrictively and cautiously. Special regard should be given to the action of antihypertensive drugs on cerebral perfusion in patients with an increased risk for the development of treatment-induced cerebral ischemic complications, such as patients with hypertensive encephalopathy or autonomic dysfunction, and elderly patients with suspected sclerotic stenosis of cerebral or neck arteries. The structural and functional lesions of cerebral vessels observed in acute and chronic hypertension are reviewed, as are the effects of antihypertensive drugs on cerebral blood flow. Calcium channel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may have advantages as first-line drugs in the treatment of patients with an elevated risk of cerebral hypoperfusion, because of the selective action of these agents on vasoconstricted vessels and their differential effects in varying regional vascular beds. The excellent efficacy of these drugs in the short- and long-term treatment of hypertension may lead to changes in the traditional management of hypertensive emergencies as well as in management strategies for other patients at risk for treatment-induced complications.", 
    "338": "The relationship between angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) and the development of cough was studied in 80 patients. Cough developed in 25 (31%). Seventeen patients had detailed respiratory investigations of whom 12 developed a new cough. Five of the 12 patients had a remission on placebo and recurrence on rechallenge. Cough does occur with ACE inhibitors but there are other possible causes of cough such as asthma, bronchitis, smoking and heart failure. The true incidence of new cough with ACE inhibitors is uncertain at present.", 
    "339": "The effectiveness of enalapril 10-40 mg/day as first choice treatment of mild (90-104 mmHg, n = 37), moderate (105-114 mmHg, n = 21), or severe (115-130 mmHg excluding accelerated hypertension, n = 16) essential hypertension was studied in an open multicentre trial. Enalapril alone controlled the hypertension (diastolic blood pressure 90 mmHg or less) in 25 patients (34%). Of these, 20 had mild and 5 had moderate hypertension. The remaining patients required either enalapril plus hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 or 25 mg/day (n = 30), or a third drug of the physician's choice (n = 9). A relationship was present between baseline blood pressure and the number of drugs required to achieve blood pressure control. Plasma creatinine increased beyond the limits of laboratory error in 3 patients, and from 100-108 mumol/l (p less than 0.05) on enalapril alone in a subgroup of patients who ultimately required a diuretic. Enalapril was well tolerated; 60 (73%) had no drug related side effects during active treatment. Tiredness (n = 5), headache (n = 4), dizziness (n = 4) and palpitations (n = 3) were the most frequent side effects. Cough was a feature in 3 patients and 1 patient had a rash. This study suggests that enalapril is an effective and well tolerated anti-hypertensive agent in mild, moderate or severe hypertension, but that caution may be required in patients with impaired renal function.", 
    "340": "The value of vasodilator drugs in the treatment of patients with chronic congestive heart failure is reviewed on the basis of the randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trials so far published. Apparently, venous, or combined venous and arteriolar dilation in addition to cardiac glycosides and diuretics may produce long-term improvement in advanced stages of heart failure. Vasodilators with isolated afterload reducing properties seem to be of limited value. Long-term improvement with nitrates and alpha-receptor blocking agents is often modest, probably due to development of tolerance. The most striking results were observed with converting enzyme inhibitors: they evoke virtually no tolerance, improve haemodynamics at rest and during exercise, relieve symptoms of heart failure and are even suggested to reduce mortality.", 
    "341": "The effect of angiotensin II and angiotensin I on isolated rat resistance vessels (inner diameter ca. 200 micron) was investigated. Angiotensin II caused a contraction (ED50 = 0.58 +/- 0.17 X 10(-8) M) of rat femoral and cerebral arteries and to a lesser extent of mesenteric and renal arteries. However, all vessels showed strong tachyphylaxis on repeated stimulation with angiotensin II. Tachyphylaxis was avoided by inducing submaximal tone in the vessels with either K, noradrenaline or serotonin. The response to angiotensin II was inhibited by saralasin but not by captopril. Angiotensin I also caused contraction of the femoral arteries (ED50 = 2.68 +/- 0.32 X 10(-8) M). These responses were inhibited by captopril and saralasin. Functional removal of the endothelium had little effect on the contractile responses to either angiotensin I or II. These results indicate that there are functional receptors to angiotensin II in the resistance vessels of the rat and that, in the presence of tone (a more physiological condition), the vessels contract to angiotensin II without tachyphylaxis. In addition, angiotensin II may be formed from angiotensin I by the angiotensin converting enzyme which may be situated in the vessel wall as well as in the endothelium.", 
    "342": "A reno-hepatic axis of blood pressure (BP) control has been proposed primarily by two developments: the lag period between the injection of the antihypertensive neutral renomedullary lipid (ANRL) into the vena cava and the beginning of the drop of the BP is significantly reduced by injection of this lipid into the portal vein; and a reno-portal shunt (RPS) accelerates markedly the drop of the BP following unclipping the Goldblatt hypertensive rat. In the present studies, three maneuvers were performed: perfusion of the isolated, blood-drained rat liver with plasma containing ANRL and delivery of the plasma into the jugular vein of a hypertensive rat; injection of captopril, establishment of a RPS of a hypertensive rat (one-kidney, one-clip) followed by unclipping; and establishment of a RPS in a normal rat. The blood-drained liver was capable of decreasing significantly the lag period of ANRL. Captopril did not potentiate the antihypertensive action of the kidney when RPS was coupled with unclipping. Following the RPS, the BP of the normal rat dropped modestly over a 3-hour period. These results further support the concept of reno-hepatic axis of BP control.", 
    "343": "Treatment of mild hypertension is becoming increasingly accepted, and many more patients are receiving antihypertensive drugs. A number of new agents offer potential benefits over traditional therapy. These benefits are due to differences in side effect profiles, which have the potential for improved compliance. Quality of life is an important consideration in the selection of antihypertensive therapy.", 
    "344": "Hyponatremia is a common complication of chronic advanced CHF unresponsive to the usual therapeutic measures. Thus low levels of serum sodium are a significant marker for severe CHF refractory to the more conventional measures. The combined use of ACE inhibitors and diuretics is generally very effective in correcting the hyponatremic state and often helpful in reversing CHF.", 
    "345": "Endothelial cells are a source of physiologically important molecules synthesized therein and secreted to the blood and/or to the subendothelial extracellular matrix. These molecules participate in formation of platelet and fibrin thrombi (e.g., von Willebrand factor and tissue factor) and contribute to antithrombotic properties of the endothelium (e.g., prostacyclin, thrombomodulin, and heparan sulfate). Endothelial cells synthesize and secrete plasminogen activator and inhibitors. They are the source of molecules regulating the growth of other cells; they synthesize angiotensin-converting enzyme, and bind lipoproteins and hormones. Finally, they are the target for, and participant in, immune reactions. Thus, endothelial cells constitute not only the first barrier between the blood and the extravascular space but also serve as a source of molecules influencing the structural and functional integrity of the circulation.", 
    "346": "Regression of left ventricular hypertrophy after control of blood pressure has been documented with some antihypertensive agents but not with others. To determine whether similar differences in regression of wall thickening also occur in resistance vessels during treatment, matched groups of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were treated for 12 weeks with either hydralazine (H) or captopril and hydrochlorothiazide (C-D) and they were compared with untreated SHR and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). Perfusion pressure was then determined in the hindlimbs of pithed rats under conditions of constant blood flow (4.0 ml/min) and maximal vasodilation (hemodilution to 22% hematocrit combined with continuous nitroprusside and papaverine infusion). This perfusion pressure, which has been validated as an index of thickening (hypertrophy) of resistance vessels walls, averaged 26.8 +/- 0.4(SE) mm Hg in untreated WKY (n = 12) and 37.6 +/- 0.4 mm Hg in untreated SHR (n = 11) (p less than .01). Treatment with H or C-D controlled blood pressure equally in SHR, but the two drugs had significantly different effects on both left ventricular hypertrophy and resistance vessels. Perfusion pressure was reduced from 37.6 +/- 0.4 mm Hg to 34.0 +/- 0.5 mm Hg (p less than .01) with C-D but only to 36.5 +/- 0.5 mm Hg with H (NS). Left ventricular weight was significantly reduced by C-D (2.02 +/- 0.02 vs 2.63 +/- 0.05 mg/g, p less than .01) but only to 2.44 +/- 0.05 mg/g by H.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Electron microscopy revealed marked folding of the paramesangial basement membrane in stenotic kidneys (n = 7). The extent of this folding was significantly less in dogs treated with captopril (n = 6). 3. It is suggested that this folding reflects angiotensin II-induced contraction of the mesangial cells, which may help maintain glomerular filtration rate following stenosis.", 
    "349": "We evaluated the dipsogenic effects of angiotensin II (Ang II) in relation to the steady-state level of the endogenous renin-angiotensin system (RAS) by measuring water intake in 22 trained dogs during three 20 min intravenous (i.v.) infusions of [Ile5] Ang II (10, 15 and 50 ng/kg/min). Measurements obtained in normally hydrated (NHyd) dogs were compared with those obtained in dogs pretreated as follows: 24 hr water deprivation (WD); WD combined with chronic blockade of the RAS (300 mg/day X 3 days of SQ 14225) (WD + SQ); and 48 hr after bilateral nephrectomy (BNX). Both WD and WD + SQ were given water before Ang II infusion. Plasma renin activity (PRA) and serum and CSF electrolytes (cisterna magna catheter) were measured. All treatments caused a significant (p less than 0.05) increase in CSF sodium (Na+) that was not paralleled by hypernatremia in BNX dogs (142 +/- 1 vs 144 +/- 1 mEq/L in NHyd). WD and WD + SQ caused a 2- and 12-fold increase in PRA, respectively; PRA was not detectable in BNX. Suppression of blood Ang II by WD + SQ produced a reduced latency and significant enhancement of the thirst behavior elicited by Ang II at all doses; however, i.v. Ang II did not elicit drinking in the WD state. Furthermore, in BNX, the same phenomenon as in WD + SQ was observed. These data are compatible with the concept that endogenous levels of Ang II play a key role in regulating drinking behavior. However, these findings do not negate the possibility that Ang II acts synergistically with CSF Na+, but not plasma Na+, to modulate drinking behavior.", 
    "350": "To assess the hormonal response to captopril pre-treatment during sodium nitroprusside (SNP) -induced hypotension, 12 patients were studied during a spinal surgical procedure. Haemodynamic data, plasma-renin activity, aldosterone, adrenaline and noradrenaline levels were measured. Patients were randomly allocated to two groups: Group I, control patients; Group II, 3 mg kg-1 captopril pre-treated patients. SNP requirement for the same level (mean arterial pressure (MAP) = 55 mmHg) and duration of hypotension (88.5 +/- 28.7 vs. 95.2 +/- 22.5 min) was significantly lower in Group II than in Group I (16.5 +/- 14.2 mg vs. 39.3 +/- 16.7 mg; P less than 0.05) and a lower SNP infusion rate was required to induce and to maintain hypotension. In Group II patients, MAP remained significantly lower than the control and Group I values for 30 min after SNP withdrawal. Cardiac index (CI) remained stable in both groups. Heart rate was not modified in Group II during hypotension. Plasma-renin activity rose more dramatically in Group II patients than in Group I both during hypotension (13.9 +/- 7.5 vs. 2.8 +/- 0.9 ng ml-1 h-1; P less than 0.05) and after hypotension (23.4 +/- 15.4 vs. 2.2 +/- 0.8 ng ml-1 h-1; P less than 0.05). Plasma catecholamine levels increased in both groups during hypotension and remained raised in captopril patients after SNP withdrawal. It can be concluded that recovery from hypotension may be delayed when using captopril and that sympathoadrenal activity induced by hypotension is not substantially altered by captopril pre-treatment, suggesting that sympathetic blockade might not be the mechanism by which captopril reduces SNP requirement during controlled hypotension for surgical procedure in man.", 
    "351": "Afterload reduction with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-inhibitors), such as captopril, is an established therapeutic measure in the adjunctive treatment of severe chronic heart failure. Unfortunately, several side effects and adverse reactions are related to this form of therapy. Calcium antagonists of the dihydropyridine group can also induce a similar afterload reduction, and substances of this group exhibit only a few adverse reactions. In the present double-blind study, the acute and chronic hemodynamic and clinical benefits of the calcium antagonist nisoldipine (= BAY K 5552) were compared with captopril in the adjunctive treatment of patients with heart failure (NYHA III or IV). The study group consisted of 17 patients. After randomization, 9 were treated with captopril (25 mg orally t.i.d.) and 8 with nisoldipine (3 were given 20 mg orally t.i.d., and 5 were given 20 mg b.i.d.). The following hemodynamic variables were obtained in the control phase after 3 days and 3 months' duration of treatment: heart rate, LVEF, SVI, ESVI, EDVI, PSP/ESVI (ratio of peak systolic pressure and end-systolic volume index), CI and systemic vascular resistance. The clinical status of the patients was assessed by means of seven criteria on an arbitrary scale. The following results were obtained: for the nisoldipine group, the average LVEF increased significantly from 0.26 to 0.31 within 3 days of treatment, but after 3 months, this increase had disappeared. All other hemodynamic parameters did not change significantly within either 3 days or 3 months of treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "352": "The treatment by antihypertensive agents has recently been improved by the introduction of angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitors, and of calcium antagonists, which have been applied successfully in children with acute and chronic hypertension. The converting enzyme inhibitor captopril is used increasingly for the treatment of severe forms of persistent hypertension in children. Side effects from this drug can largely be avoided by using low daily doses. The calcium-antagonist nifedipine can now be regarded as the drug of choice in the treatment of acute elevation of blood pressure in infants and children. For this indication it appears to be superior to other drugs because of its prompt and safe efficacy after sublingual administration.", 
    "353": "Simple and sensitive enzyme immunoassays (EIAs), discriminating a new angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, cilazapril [9(s) - [1(s)-(ethoxycarbonyl)-3-phenylpropylamino]-octahydro-10-oxo-6H- pyridazo[1,2-a] [1,2]diazepine-1(s)carboxylic acid] and its active metabolite [9(s)-[1(s)-carboxy-3-phenylpropylamino]-octahydro-10-oxo-6H- pyridazo[1,2-a][1,2]diazepine-1(s)carboxylic acid] were developed for pharmacokinetic studies of this drug which is used as an antihypertensive agent. These assays can be performed directly on serum or plasma specimens without pretreatment. The EIA for cilazapril (prodrug) allowed the determination of as little as 30 pg/mL, while a 1000-times greater concentration of its active metabolite was required to achieve the same extent of inhibition. The EIA for the active metabolite exhibited a sensitivity and specificity similar to those of the prodrug. Plasma specimens from a human volunteer study and a marmoset subacute toxicity study were assayed by these two newly developed EIAs. The plasma levels of active metabolite determined by the EIA were compared with those assayed by radioenzymatic assay, and a good correlation was observed between them."
