The expression of PTEN of aorta was examined in the aortic-constricted hypertensive rats (hypertension group), in the aortic-constricted hypertensive rats treated with captopril(hypertension and captopril group), and in the rats having undergone sham operation (control group). At day 28 after surgery, the aortas were collected from the groups. The expression of PTEN mRNA was detected by RT-PCR. The expression and location of PTEN protein were determined by immunohistochemistry. The results showed that the expression of PTEN in aorta of the hypertension group was significantly lower than that of the hypertension and captopril group, and similarly lower than that of the control group. The intensity of PTEN-positive immunohistochemical production in aorta of the hypertension group was weaker than that of the hypertension and captopril group, and likewise, it was weaker than the control. PTEN-positive immunohistochemical production was located in VSMC of aorta. The findings indicated that the expression of PTEN is reduced in hypertensive aorta, that the reduced PTEN experession can be reversed by captopril treatment, that AngII and the increased mechanical strain may participate in regulating expression of PTEN, and that PTEN may play a role in the arterial remodeling induced by hypertension.", 
    "1": "The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the anti-proteinuric effect of ramipril and verapamil in patients with steroid-resistant idiopathic nephrotic syndrome. Twenty one (21) cases of steroid-resistant idiopathic nephrotic syndrome were randomized to receive ramipril (11) and verapamil (10) and were followed up for 12 months; monthly for the 1st 3 months and then every 3 months for the remaining study period. The degree of reduction of proteinuria, blood pressure, serum creatinine, serum albumin and side effects were noted between the two groups. The comparison within the groups over different time periods was made using paired 't' test and between the groups for specific time period by unpaired 't' test. The level of significance was taken as 5% or below.", 
    "2": "Seventeen patients (nine in the ramipril group and eight in the verapamil group) completed the study. The mean age of the patients, duration of illness, 24 hours urinary excretion of protein, mean arterial pressure, serum creatinine, cholesterol and albumin were similar in both the groups at time of randomization. The 24 hours urinary protein excretion decreased from 6319.44 +/- 1971.70 mg/day to 1852.44 +/- 1813.74 mg/day in patients receiving ramipril and from 5332.87 +/- 1947.47 mg /day to 2759.37 +/- 1929.6 mg/day in patients treated with verapamil after 12 months. There was no statistically significant difference in the reduction of proteinuria between the two groups. However, reduction in proteinuria was statistically significant from 2nd month onwards in Ramipril group and reduction was sustained throughout the study period. Reduction in mean arterial pressure was better achieved in Ramipril groups. The change in the serum potassium, creatinine, cholesterol and albumin were similar in either group of patients. Cough (2), hypotension (1) and reversible rise in serum creatinine (1) were observed with ramipril and no side effect was noted with verapamil.", 
    "3": "Both ramipril and verapamil can reduce proteinuria in patients suffering from steroid-resistant idiopathic nephrotic syndrome. However, ramipril had a better and sustained reduction in proteinuria with well-controlled mean arterial pressure. Verapamil can be considered as an alternative to ramipril when the use of the latter is not tolerated because of side effects and/or worsening of renal function in patients with chronic renal insufficiency.",

This study sought to identify the prevalence and the determinants of subclinical diabetic heart disease.", 
    "5": "A group of 219 unselected patients with type 2 diabetes without known cardiac disease underwent resting and stress echocardiography. After exclusion of coronary artery disease or LV hypertrophy, the remaining 120 patients (age 57+/-10 years, 73 male) were studied with tissue Doppler imaging. Peak systolic strain of each wall and systolic (Sm) and diastolic (Em) velocity of each basal segment were measured from the three apical views and averaged for each patient. Significant subclinical LV dysfunction was identified according to Sm and Em normal ranges adjusted by age and sex. Strain and Em were correlated with clinical, therapeutic, echocardiographic and biochemical variables, and significant independent associations were sought using a multiple linear regression model.", 
    "6": "Significant subclinical LV dysfunction was present in 27% diabetic patients. Myocardial systolic dysfunction by peak strain was independently associated with glycosylated haemoglobin level (p<0.001) and lack of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor treatment (p=0.003).

    "8": "Although it is generally accepted that the efficacy of imidapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, in congestive heart failure (CHF) is due to improvement of hemodynamic parameters, the significance of its effect on gene expression for sarcolemma (SL) and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) proteins has not been fully understood. In this study, we examined the effects of long-term treatment of imidapril on mortality, cardiac function, and gene expression for SL Na+/K+ ATPase and Na+ -Ca2+ exchanger as well as SR Ca2+ pump ATPase, Ca2+ release channel (ryanodine receptor), phospholamban, and calsequestrin in CHF due to myocardial infarction. Heart failure subsequent to myocardial infarction was induced by occluding the left coronary artery in rats, and treatment with imidapril (1 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)) was started orally at the end of 3 weeks after surgery and continued for 37 weeks. The animals were assessed hemodynamically and the heart and lung were examined morphologically. Some hearts were immediately frozen at -70 degrees C for the isolation of RNA as well as SL and SR membranes. The mortality of imidapril-treated animals due to heart failure was 31% whereas that of the untreated heart failure group was 64%. Imidapril treatment improved cardiac performance, attenuated cardiac remodeling, and reduced morphological changes in the heart and lung. The depressed SL Na+/K+ ATPase and increased SL Na+-Ca2+ exchange activities as well as reduced SR Ca2+ pump and SR Ca2+ release activities in the failing hearts were partially prevented by imidapril. Although changes in gene expression for SL Na+/K+ ATPase isoforms as well as Na+-Ca2+ exchanger and SR phospholamban were attenuated by treatments with imidapril, no alterations in mRNA levels for SR Ca2+ pump proteins and Ca2+ release channels were seen in the untreated or treated rats with heart failure. These results suggest that the beneficial effects of imidapril in CHF may be due to improvements in cardiac performance and changes in SL gene expression.",

    "12": "One study using pharmacy claims from 25 employers with data from 402 786 members modeled the range of anticipated plan/employer savings associated with single- to 3-tier shifts and found that, going from a single- to 3-tier benefit results in decreased plan/employer pharmaceutical costs from $650 to $494 (24% decrease) per member per year and decreased pharmaceutical utilization from 12.3 to 9.4 (23.6% decrease) prescriptions per member per year. Another study demonstrated that adding an additional tier decreased pharmaceutical utilization, with a dramatic increase in member contribution offsetting the plan's expected increase in expenditures. This shift in pharmaceutical expenditures appeared to have no effect on overall medical utilization over a 3-year follow-up. Finally, a study converting members from a single- to 3-tier incentive-based formulary, associated with two- to fourfold copayment increases, resulted in a 10% discontinuation rate for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, statins, and proton-pump inhibitors among members who were primarily hourly employees. For salaried workers, the addition of a tier to their benefit appeared to have minimal impact on pharmaceutical utilization.",

Negatively charged surfaces are functional constituents of different LDL apheresis systems. Therefore, contact activation was investigated during LDL apheresis with three different systems: (i) heparin-induced extracorporeal LDL precipitation (HELP); (ii) dextran sulfate cellulose (DSC) columns; and (iii) modified polyacrylate gels (DALI) in a clinical setting.", 
    "15": "24 prevalent patients on regular LDL apheresis treatment were included in the study. Bradykinin, prekallikrein, and HMW kininogen were measured during a single LDL apheresis at different sites of the systems.", 
    "16": "LDL apheresis with DSC and DALI was associated with an extreme release of bradykinin after the passage of plasma or blood through the LDL adsorbers as well as with a decrease of prekallikrein and HMW kininogen during the course of the treatment. Bradykinin release exceeded the degradation capacity of the kininase II, since markedly elevated bradykinin concentrations were observed in the arterial line of the extracorporeal circuits of both systems. This was not associated with anaphylactoid reactions. In contrast to the treatments with DSC and DALI, the HELP system did not lead to any activation of the kallikrein-kinin system.", 
    "17": "From our data we conclude that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are contraindicated in patients on LDL apheresis with the DSC and the DALI system. Because the HELP system does not activate the kallikrein-kinin system, patients who need ACE inhibitors are predisposed for this LDL apheresis procedure.", 
    "18": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are important drugs in the treatment of hypertension, heart failure and after acute myocardial infarction. The patents for most of these agents have now expired and the industry has introduced angiotensin II receptor blockers (ATII receptor blockers) with a mode of action similar to that of ACE inhibitors. All six ATII receptor blockers on the Norwegian market have the indication hypertension, while one of them also has the indication heart failure when treatment with ACE inhibitors is not appropriate. Some studies have compared ACE inhibitors with ATII receptor blockers in the treatment of heart failure and after acute myocardial infarction and found the two classes of drugs to be about equally efficacious. There is no reason to change the current practice of choosing ACE inhibitors as first line treatment for these conditions. If ACE inhibitors cannot be used, ATII receptor blockers represent an acceptable alternative.",

Relative to those initiated on enalapril, no significant differences in the combined end point of readmission to the hospital for CHF or mortality were observed among users of lisinopril, ramipril, or other ACE inhibitors. In terms of effectiveness for the treatment of patients with CHF, the findings of this study suggest a class effect among ACE inhibitors.", 
    "20": "This article provides information and a commentary on landmark trials presented at the American Heart Association meeting held in November 2004, relevant to the pathophysiology, prevention, and treatment of heart failure. An open trial of the ACORN Cardiac Support Device (CSD) showed encouraging preliminary results in patients with severe heart failure. The PEACE (Prevention of Events with Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme inhibition) study supports data from previous studies showing that ACE inhibitors reduce vascular events in patients at increased risk. The CREATE (clinical trial of metabolic modulation in acute MI treatment evaluation) study of patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) showed no mortality benefit of a glucose/insulin/potassium regimen, but treatment with reviparin reduced the incidence of death, MI, or stroke. Azimilide was not associated with a significant reduction in shocks, but reduced the shocks or episodes of markedly symptomatic ventricular tachycardia terminated by pacing in the SHIELD (Shock Inhibition Evaluation with Azimilide) study. The addition of isosorbide dinitrate plus hydralazine to standard therapy improved survival in black heart failure patients in the A-HeFT (African-American Heart Failure Trial) study. In an investigation of hypertensive patients with diabetes, carvedilol had fewer adverse effects on diabetic control than metoprolol. A meta-analysis of high-dose vitamin E supplementation suggested an association with increased mortality. The ESCAPE (Evaluation Study of CHF and Pulmonary Artery Catheterisation Effectiveness) study showed no benefit of pulmonary artery catheterisation over clinical management in patients with severe heart failure. Routine prophylactic coronary revascularisation for stable coronary disease prior to major vascular surgery showed no benefit in the CARP (Coronary Artery Revascularization Prophylaxis) study. Analysis of data from SCD-HeFT supports the cost-effectiveness of ICDs in heart failure, although overall cost implications may be prohibitive.", 
    "21": "A persistent, chronic dry cough is the most common adverse effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors therapy. The mechanism of this respiratory adverse effect is related to the inhibition of ACE and the accumulation of bradykinin, substance P, prostanoids and other inflammatory neuropeptides in the airways. The aim of this study was to follow the relationship between 15-day administration of enalapril and the defense reflexes (cough and bronchoconstriction) of the airways in experimental animals, as well as the possibility of their pharmacological restriction with simultaneous diltiazem administration. Cough reflex was investigated by the method of mechanical irritation of laryngopharyngeal and tracheobronchial area in non-anesthetized cats. The reactivity of tracheal smooth muscles of the airways to bronchoconstrictor mediators (histamine 10 nM - 1 mM, acetylcholine 10 nM - 1 mM and KCl 1 mM - 100 mM) was evaluated by an in vitro method in guinea pigs. Enalapril 5 mg/kg/day and diltiazem 30 mg/kg/day were administered perorally for 15 days. The results showed that long-lasting administration of enalapril resulted in a significant increase of measured cough parameters and increased reactivity of tracheal smooth muscle to histamine and KCl. Simultaneous administration of enalapril together with diltiazem significantly decreased the enalapril induced cough, and decreased enalapril induced hyperreactivity of tracheal smooth muscles to KCl. The results showed a partially protective effect of diltiazem and enalapril co-administration on the respiratory adverse effects induced by enalapril therapy.", 
    "22": "Cardiovascular complications in diabetic patients, especially type 2, can be classified as microvascular (renal, ophthalmologic and neurologic) and macrovascular (coronary, cerebrovascular and peripheral vascular). Type 1 and 2 diabetic patients have increased cardiovascular risk, especially for coronary artery disease. This has been well established through high-quality studies, as have interventions to ameliorate the major risk factors. The main risk factors for increased incidence of coronary artery disease in diabetic patients include hyperlipidemia, hypertension, smoking, microalbuminuria and hyperglycemia. The therapeutic approach to the type 2 diabetic patient should include--if there is no individual contraindication--diet control, physical exercise, smoking cessation and, particularly, pharmacologic interventions with antiplatelets (mainly aspirin and clopidogrel) and/or anticoagulants (warfarin), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, beta-blockers and anti-dyslipidemics (mainly statins), as well as oral antidiabetics (or insulin). In this paper we present and discuss the results of lowering cardiovascular risk in these patients, which should lead to a marked decrease in the incidence of coronary artery, cerebrovascular and peripheral vascular disease, with consequent improvement in prognosis.", 
    "23": "Genetic depletion of dystrophin-related protein (DRP) complex causes cardiomyopathy in animals and humans. We found in a previous study that some types of DRP were degraded and that calpain content was increased in rats with non-genetically induced heart failure. The present study was aimed at examining the effects of an angiotensin-I-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) trandolapril (Tra) or an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker (ARB) candesartan (Can), both of which are known to improve the pathophysiology of chronic heart failure (CHF) on degradation of DRP in failing hearts.", 
    "24": "Coronary artery-ligated (CAL) and sham-operated rats (Sham rats) were treated orally with 3 mg/kg/day trandolapril (Tra) or 1 mg/kg/day candesartan (Can) from the 2nd to 8th week after surgery.",

Calcium-activated neutral proteases mu-calpain and m-calpain increased in the surviving LV at the 8th week of postmyocardial infarction. Proteolytic activity in the presence of 5 mM Ca2+ markedly increased at the 2nd and 8th weeks, whereas 50 microM Ca2+ slightly but significantly increased proteolysis of casein. Tra or Can treatment improved the hemodynamic parameters, attenuated changes in alpha-SG and dystrophin, and reversed both calpain contents and activities of the failing heart back to sham levels.",

    "27": "An analytical method for simultaneous determination of benazepril and its active metabolite, benazeprilat, in human plasma by high-performance liquid chromatography/electrospray-mass spectrometry was developed and validated. Rutaecarpine was selected as the internal standard. The separation was achieved on a C(18) column with acetonitrile and aqueous solution (0.1% formic acid) as mobile phase with a gradient mode. The quantification of target compounds was using a selective ionization recording at m/z 425.5 for benazepril, m/z 397.5 for benzeprilat and m/z 288.3 for rutaecarpine. The correlation coefficients of the calibration curves were better than 0.992 (n = 6), in the range of 6.67-666.67 ng/ml for benazepril and benazeprilat. The inter- and intra-day accuracy, precision, linear range had been investigated in detail. The method can be used to assess the bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of the drug.", 
    "28": "Atherosclerosis is still an important disease. It accounts for 39% of deaths in the U.K. and 12 million U.S citizens have atherosclerosis-associated disease. Atherosclerosis may exert clinical effects by slow narrowing, producing stable angina or dramatic rupture, producing acute coronary syndromes such as unstable angina or myocardial infarction and death. Macrophages are abundant in ruptured atherosclerotic plaques. Macrophages are innate immune effectors, i.e. they are activated without antigenic specificity. This may make them liable to indiscriminate tissue damage, since they are less selective than lymphocytes. Macrophages are recruited and activated by many signals and have an impressive armamentarium of molecules to promote tissue damage. Macrophage recruitment by abnormal endothelium over developing atherosclerotic plaques, is aided by endothelial expression of adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM, ELAM). Use of knockout mice has implicated the chemoattractant cytokine (chemokine) MCP-1 in attracting macrophage recruitment in atherosclerosis. Macrophage-activation stimuli associated with atherosclerotic risk factors include oxidised low density lipoprotein (oxLDL, \"bad cholesterol\"), advanced glycosylation end products (AGEs) of diabetes, angiotensin II and endothelin. Substantial work has clarified macrophage activation by OxLDL via macrophage scavenger receptors (MSRs), especially MSRA and CD36. Activated macrophages express effector molecules that kill cells and degrade extracellular matrix. These include Fas-L and nitric oxide (NO). Macrophage NO is derived from the high output inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) pathway and upregulates vascular smooth muscle (VSMC) cell surface Fas, priming them for apoptosis. Activated macrophages express surface Fas-L, similar to cytotoxic T-lymphocytes and natural killer cells. Since VSMCs promote plaque stability, VSMC apoptosis may promote plaque rupture. Macrophages express multiple metalloproteinases (e.g. stromelysin) and serine proteases (e.g. urokinase) that degrade the extracellular matrix, weakening the plaque and making it rupture prone. Macrophages secrete numerous other effectors including reactive oxygen species, eicosanoids, tumour necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-1. Macrophage-derived transforming growth factor beta promotes fibrosis. Existing cardiovascular treatments including angiotensin II receptor antagonists and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, aspirin, cholesterol reduction agents especially statins may inhibit macrophages. The interaction of NO-donors with macrophages and apoptosis is complex and bifunctional. Traditional anti-inflammatory agents such as glucocorticoids and cyclophosphamide have very serious side effects and are probably inappropriate. Novel anti-inflammatory agents e.g. new immunosuppressives and anti-TNF therapy may have an improved cost-benefit ratio.", 
    "29": "Angiotensin II plays a significant role in cell growth and proliferation in model systems and in humans. Numerous studies have shown that left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) increases the risk of coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, stroke or transient ischemic attack; all-cause deaths, and sudden death. The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) has provided beneficial effects on LVH regression and on cardiac remodeling in the presence of hypertension and heart failure. The new class of ARBs appears to provide cardioprotective effects that are similar to those of the ACE inhibitors. Most of the beneficial effects provided by these agents appear to be related to a more complete blockade of the angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor. However, costimulation of the angiotensin II type 2 (AT2) receptor appears to increase nitric oxide and thus causes some bradykinin-like effects. Evidence for the role of angiotensin II in promoting LVH as well as abnormal regulation of the angiotensin II signal transduction pathways in model systems and in humans has been reviewed. Secondly, the mechanisms for the beneficial effects of angiotensin II receptor blockers studied in model systems and in humans, including possible involvement in the formation of reactive oxygen species by mononuclear cells, are presented. Finally, results from large-scale interventions such as the Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction (LIFE) study, as well as an overview of the Valsartan Antihypertensive Long-term Use Evaluation (VALUE) trial involving the use of ARB in high-risk patients, are presented.", 
    "30": "Bradykinin and Lys-bradykinin are potent peptide mediators implicated in several physiopathological effects in mammals. They act through activation of G-protein-coupled constitutive B(2) or inducible kinin B(1) receptors linked to signaling pathways involving increased intracellular Ca(++) concentrations and/or release of mediators including arachidonic acid metabolites, NO and EDHF. In the cardiovascular system, the kallikrein-kinin system exerts a fine control of vascular smooth muscle tone and arterial blood pressure, and plays a significant cardioprotective effect. This has been lately confirmed in experimental studies employing transgenic mice overexpressing human tissue kallikrein and animals with knockout of kinin B(1) and B(2) receptor gene. Disturbances in this system are associated with arterial hypertension, myocardial ischaemia and other clinical complications. Inhibitors of kininase II (angiotensin-converting enzyme) have been prescribed successfully to patients with cardiovascular diseases, but there is still a great interest in developing drugs or pharmacological strategies that augment the activity of kininogen-kallikrein-kinin system in pathological conditions. Delivery of adenovirus vector containing the human tissue kallikrein gene (gene kallikrein therapy) has emerged as a great potential to satisfy these conditions. This review provides a summary of plasma and tissue kallikrein-kinin system, focusing on the pharmacological properties, kinin receptors and drugs reported to interfere with their actions. The modulatory effects of the kallikrein-kinin system on cardiovascular system, particularly in regulating smooth muscle tone and arterial blood pressure and in preventing myocardium ischaemia have also been explored in the review.", 
    "31": "The renin-angiotensin system is a key target for drugs combating cardiovascular disease. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor type-1 (AT1 receptor) blockers are well known. However, angiotensin peptides can be generated through a number of pathways besides the classic system. This review outlines some of these pathways, their relation to the classic system and the likely effect of inhibiting them. Renin is still the key enzyme in angiotensin peptide generation and seems to be the only route to angiotensin I formation in vivo. Renin inhibitors may have some advantages in terms of specificity. Also, by blocking angiotensin I generation, the production of downstream bioactive angiotensin I metabolites should also be blocked. Chymase, a mast cell serine protease, cleaves angiotensin I to produce angiotensin II and may be important at sites of inflammation such as atherosclerotic plaque. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a carboxypeptidase structurally related to ACE but resistant to ACE inhibitors, has a protective effect on cardiac function. Neutral endopeptidase 24.11 breaks down both atrial natriuretic peptide and angiotensin II. Inhibiting it potentiates the action of endogenous atrial peptide but only affects circulating angiotensin II when basal levels are above normal. Dual inhibitors of ACE and endopeptidase 24.11 may be of value where there is both sodium retention and increased angiotensin II. Targeting the renin-angiotensin system by gene therapy or antibody treatment may provide a longer-term treatment for hypertension.", 
    "32": "In the submitted paper the author summarizes findings concerning the controversial disease of contemporary cardiology--myocarditis. The prevalence of myocarditis in post-mortem material is about 1%. It is usually of viral origin (in particular Coxsackie viruses group B). The origin can be however also bacterial, spirochetal, mycoplasmatic, mycotic, protozoan and helminthic. Clinically it is manifested by a wide spectrum of manifestations from subclinical forms to fatal conditions (cardiac failure to cardiogenic shock, arrhythmia). On the ECG it is usually manifested by changes of the repolarization stage ST-T, by impaired conduction, possibly by pathological Q waves. Echocardiography can reveal localized (rarely diffuse) kinetic disorders which frequently do not correspond to classical areas supplied by a certain coronary artery, reversible myocardial hypertrophy is frequent. As to biochemical markers, sometimes a prolonged elevation of cardiospecific enzymes can be recorded. The most accurate evidence is that obtained by endomyocardial biopsy (but low activity). As to treatment, we start in the acute stage with bed rest and antibiotics, administration of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors is also recommended. In exceptional cases (in particular progressing acute conditions) administration of corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressives can be tried. Non-steroid anti-rheumatic preparations are not administered with the exception of symptomatic indication, (except in the acute stage of the disease).", 
    "33": "Angiotensin II is a multi-functional bioactive peptide and recent reports have suggested that angiotensin II is a proangiogenic growth factor. A retrospective cohort study revealed that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors decreased cancer risk, however, the precise mechanism is unknown. We hypothesized that endogenous angiotensin II plays a crucial role in tumor-associated angiogenesis. Tumors implanted in the subcutaneous tissue of wild-type mice developed intensive angiogenesis with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) induction in tumor stroma. AT1a receptor (AT1a-R), but not AT1b receptor or AT2 receptor was expressed in tumor stroma and systemic administration of an AT1-R antagonist reduced tumor-associated angiogenesis and VEGF expression in tumor stroma. Angiotensin II up-regulates VEGF expression through the pathway including protein kinase C, AP-1 and NF-kappaB in fibroblasts, the major cellular component of tumor stroma. VEGF is a major determinant of tumor-associated angiogenesis in the present model, since angiogenesis was markedly reduced by either a VEGF neutralizing antibody or a VEGF receptor kinase inhibitor. Compared with the wild-type, tumor-associated angiogenesis was reduced in AT1a-R null mice, with reduced expression of VEGF in the stroma, and this reduction in AT1a-R null mice was not inhibited by an AT1-R antagonist. These suggest that host stromal VEGF induction by AT1a-R signaling is a key regulator of tumor-associated angiogenesis and tumor growth. AT1a-R signaling blockade may be a novel and effective therapeutic strategy against cancers.",

The high prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus in African Americans, compared with Whites, compounds the excessive burden of cardiovascular and kidney disease. The Hypertension in African American Working Group of the International Society of Hypertension in Blacks recently developed a consensus document that presented a practical, evidence-based approach aimed at achieving better blood pressure control. It was thought that a new approach, targeted at US Blacks, was needed to achieve better blood pressure control and enhanced target tissue protection. Key elements of the document include (i) emphasis on the importance of therapeutic lifestyle modification such as weight loss, decreased sodium ingestion, increased potassium intake, exercise, and weight loss, to name a few; (ii) recommendation of combination antihypertensive agents because of the high prevalence of individuals with >15 mm Hg above SBP goal and/or 10 mmHg above DBP goal (140/90 unless there is also diabetes and/or kidney disease with >1 g proteinuria daily). Effective combinations include beta-adrenoceptor antagonist/diuretic, ACE inhibitor/diuretic, ACE inhibitor/calcium channel antagonist, and angiotensin receptor antagonist/diuretic; and (iii) the recommendations do not differ from other racial/ethnic groups where specific or compelling indications for the use of specific classes of antihypertensive agents exist.", 
    "50": "Angiotensin II (AII), the main effector of the Renin Angiotensin System (RAS), plays a central role in the hemodynamic and non-hemodynamic mechanisms of chronic renal disease and is currently the main target of interventions aimed to prevent the onset and progression of chronic nephropathies to end stage renal disease (ESRD). In addition to ameliorate glomerular hyperfiltration and size-selectivity, reduce protein traffic and prevent glomerular and tubulo-interstitial toxicity of ultrafiltered proteins, RAS inhibitors also limit the direct nephrotoxic effects of AII. Thus, both ACE inhibitors (ACEi) and AII antagonists (ATA) exert a specific nephroprotective effect in both experimental and human chronic renal disease. This effect is time-dependent and is observed across degrees of renal insufficiency. Forced ACEi or ATA up-titration above doses recommended to control arterial hypertension and combined treatment with both agents allow to optimise A II inhibition and maximize renoprotection. Multifactorial interventions combining RAS inhibition to treatments targeted also to non-RAS mechanisms may even achieve regression of glomerulosclerosis and chronic tubulo-interstitial injury. Studies are needed to assess whether renal damage can be reverted to such a point that renal function may be fully prevented from worsen, and possibly improve. The economic impact of even a partial improvement would be enormous. Moreover, chronic renal insufficiency is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease and effective nephroprotection may also decrease the excess cardiovascular morbidity and mortality associated with chronic nephropathies. In patients with renal insufficiency ACEi are even more cardioprotective than in those without, and are well tolerated. Thus, RAS inhibitor therapy should be offered to all renal patients without specific contraindications, including those closer to renal replacement therapy.",

Aspirin reduces the risk of thrombotic events in a broad range of patients with vascular disease and, in selected individuals, is beneficial for primary prevention. Although recommended by existing guidelines, in secondary and in primary prevention trials the clinical efficacy of low-dose aspirin in patients with diabetes appears to be substantially lower than in individuals without diabetes. In this review, we discuss possible mechanisms that may contribute to reduce the antithrombotic activity of aspirin in diabetes. We also discuss adjuvant therapies used in diabetic patients that may potentially improve the antithrombotic efficacy of aspirin.",

Subsequent data showed a role for angiotensin II in long-term effects on cardiovascular structure, including cardiac hypertrophy and vascular remodeling. Importantly, recent human studies with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers have demonstrated exciting clinical benefits including decreases in incidence of stroke, diabetes, and end-stage renal disease that suggest important new mechanisms of action. In this review, we focus on new roles for the renin-angiotensin system in the endothelium based on the concepts of diverse signals and effects mediated by multiple angiotensin I- and angiotensin II-derived peptides, multiple angiotensin metabolizing enzymes, multiple receptors, and vascular bed-specific intracellular signals.",

Clinical in-stent restenosis was demonstrated in 20 patients (15%), whereas 116 patients (85%) remained free of signs or symptoms of recurrent ischemia. FMD was significantly impaired in patients with restenosis versus those without restenosis (percent diameter variation 4.6+/-5.8% versus 9.5+/-6.6%, P=0.002); moreover, 4% of patients with FMD > or =7% (median value) developed in-stent restenosis versus 28% of those with FMD <7% (P=0.0001). On multivariate analysis, FMD was the strongest predictor of restenosis (OR 4.5, 95% CI 2.4 to 12.0); conversely, nitroglycerin-mediated dilation did not independently predict the risk of restenosis (OR 2.4, 95% CI 0.8 to 6.3).",

    "56": "To ascertain the mechanism of interaction between angiotensins (AI and AII) and the liver, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (captopril) and a receptor antagonist (losartan) were used. Monovascular or bivascular liver perfusion was used to assess both hemodynamic (portal and arterial hypertensive responses) and metabolic (glucose production and oxygen consumption) effects. Microphysiometry was used for isolated liver cell assays to assess AII or losartan membrane receptor-mediated interaction. Captopril abolishes portal hypertensive response (PHR) to AI but not the AII effect. AII infused via the portal pathway promotes calcium-dependent PHR but not a hypertensive response in the arterial pathway (AHR); when infused into the arterial pathway AII promotes calcium-dependent PHR and AHR. Losartan infused into the portal vein abolishes PHR to AII but not the metabolic response; when infused via both pathways it abolishes the hypertensive responses and inhibits the metabolic effects. Isolated liver cells specifically respond to AII. Sinusoidal cells, but not hepatocytes, respond to 10 nM losartan. We conclude that AI has to be converted to AII to produce PHR. Quiescent stellate cells interacts in vitro with AII and losartan. Hemodynamic responses to AII are losartan-dependent but metabolic responses are partially losartan-independent. AII hemodynamic actions are mainly presinusoidal.",

However, randomized outcomes trials conducted in patients with hypertension with and without left ventricular hypertrophy and in patients with vascular diseases at high risk for cardiovascular events provide a strong rationale for long-term angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition or angiotensin receptor blockade in patients with DHF. The treatment of patients with acutely decompensated DHF remains purely empirical. Thus, a pragmatic approach to the treatment of acutely decompensated DHF that includes the use of B-type natriuretic peptide is presented.", 
    "58": "Here we studied the mechanism of thrombolytic response (THR) induced by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE-I) in vivo in anaesthetised Wistar rats with extracorporeal circulation. Intravenous injections of ACE-Is, i.e. perindopril or quinapril at non-hypotensive doses of 3-30 microg kg(-1) produced a dose-dependent thrombolysis that was associated with a parallel rise in arterial blood levels of 6-keto-PGF(1 alpha), but not those of TXB(2) or PGE(2). L-NAME at a dose of 5 mg kg(-1) affected significantly neither ACE-I-induced thrombolysis nor prostacyclinemia; however, the pre-treatment with icatibant (0.1-0.5 mg kg(-1)) abolished both effects. The selective COX-1 inhibitor, SC 560 (100-300 microg kg(-1) i.v.), or a would be selective COX-3 inhibitor--paracetamol (acetaminophen, 1-3 mg kg(-1)), both agents induced a transient thrombolysis and slightly potentiated thrombolysis by ACE-Is. In contrast, selective COX-2 inhibitors (rofecoxib>celecoxib>nimesulide>NS 398) were thrombogenic, and abolished THR and rise in 6-keto-PGF(1 alpha) induced by ACE-Is. Summing up, in our in vivo bioassay system ACE-Is such as quinapril, perindopril or captopril at non-hypotensive doses evoke THR that is mediated by endogenous bradykinin and prostacyclin derived from endothelial COX-2.", 
    "59": "In 2002, (before the establishment of the Ontario Health Technology Advisory Committee), the Medical Advisory Secretariat conducted a health technology policy assessment on biventricular (BiV) pacing, also called cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). The goal of treatment with BiV pacing is to improve cardiac output for people in heart failure (HF) with conduction defect on ECG (wide QRS interval) by synchronizing ventricular contraction. The Medical Advisory Secretariat concluded that there was evidence of short (6 months) and longer-term (12 months) effectiveness in terms of cardiac function and quality of life (QoL). More recently, a hospital submitted an application to the Ontario Health Technology Advisory Committee to review CRT, and the Medical Advisory Secretariat subsequently updated its health technology assessment.", 
    "60": "Chronic HF results from any structural or functional cardiac disorder that impairs the ability of the heart to act as a pump. It is estimated that 1% to 5% of the general population (all ages) in Europe have chronic HF. (1;2) About one-half of the patients with HF are women, and about 40% of men and 60% of women with this condition are aged older than 75 years. The incidence (i.e., the number of new cases in a specified period) of chronic HF is age dependent: from 1 to 5 per 1,000 people each year in the total population, to as high as 30 to 40 per 1,000 people each year in those aged 75 years and older. Hence, in an aging society, the prevalence (i.e., the number of people with a given disease or condition at any time) of HF is increasing, despite a reduction in cardiovascular mortality. A recent study revealed 28,702 patients were hospitalized for first-time HF in Ontario between April 1994 and March 1997. (3) Women comprised 51% of the cohort. Eighty-five percent were aged 65 years or older, and 58% were aged 75 years or older. Patients with chronic HF experience shortness of breath, a limited capacity for exercise, high rates of hospitalization and rehospitalization, and die prematurely. (2;4) The New York Heart Association (NYHA) has provided a commonly used functional classification for the severity of HF (2;5): CLASS I: No limitation of physical activity. No symptoms with ordinary exertion.CLASS II: Slight limitations of physical activity. Ordinary activity causes symptoms.CLASS III: Marked limitation of physical activity. Less than ordinary activity causes symptoms. Asymptomatic at rest.CLASS IV: Inability to carry out any physical activity without discomfort. Symptoms at rest.The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute estimates that 35% of patients with HF are in functional NYHA class I; 35% are in class II; 25%, class III; and 5%, class IV. (5) Surveys (2) suggest that from 5% to 15% of patients with HF have persistent severe symptoms, and that the remainder of patients with HF is evenly divided between those with mild and moderately severe symptoms. Overall, patients with chronic, stable HF have an annual mortality rate of about 10%. (2) One-third of patients with new-onset HF will die within 6 months of diagnosis. These patients do not survive to enter the pool of those with \"chronic\" HF. About 60% of patients with incident HF will die within 3 years, and there is limited evidence that the overall prognosis has improved in the last 15 years. To date, the diagnosis and management of chronic HF has concentrated on patients with the clinical syndrome of HF accompanied by severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Major changes in treatment have resulted from a better understanding of the pathophysiology of HF and the results of large clinical trials. Treatment for chronic HF includes lifestyle management, drugs, cardiac surgery, or implantable pacemakers and defibrillators. Despite pharmacologic advances, which include diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers, spironolactone, and digoxin, many patients remain symptomatic on maximally tolerated doses.", 
    "61": "Owing to the limitations of drug therapy, cardiac transplantation and device therapies have been used to try to improve QoL and survival of patients with chronic HF. Ventricular pacing is an emerging treatment option for patients with severe HF that does not respond well to medical therapy. Traditionally, indications for pacing include bradyarrhythmia, sick sinus syndrome, atrioventricular block, and other indications, including combined sick sinus syndrome with atrioventricular block and neurocardiogenic syncope. Recently, BiV pacing as a new, adjuvant therapy for patients with chronic HF and mechanical dyssynchrony has been investigated. Ventricular dysfunction is a sign of HF; and, if associated with severe intraventricular conduction delay, it can cause dyssynchronous ventricular contractions resulting in decreased ventricular filling. The therapeutic intent is to activate both ventricles simultaneously, thereby improving the mechanical efficiency of the ventricles. About 30% of patients with chronic HF have intraventricular conduction defects. (6) These conduction abnormalities progress over time and lead to discoordinated contraction of an already hemodynamically compromised ventricle. Intraventricular conduction delay has been associated with clinical instability and an increased risk of death in patients with HF. (7) Hence, BiV pacing, which involves pacing left and right ventricles simultaneously, may provide a more coordinated pattern of ventricular contraction and thereby potentially reduce QRS duration, and intraventricular and interventricular asynchrony. People with advanced chronic HF, a wide QRS complex (i.e., the portion of the electrocardiogram comprising the Q, R, and S waves, together representing ventricular depolarization), low left ventricular ejection fraction and contraction dyssynchrony in a viable myocardium and normal sinus rhythm, are the target patients group for BiV pacing. One-half of all deaths in HF patients are sudden, and the mode of death is arrhythmic in most cases. Internal cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) combined with BiV pacemakers are therefore being increasingly considered for patients with HF who are at high risk of sudden death. CURRENT IMPLANTATION TECHNIQUE FOR CARDIAC RESYNCHRONIZATION: Conventional dual-chamber pacemakers have only 2 leads: 1 placed in the right atrium and the other in the right ventricle. The technique used for BiV pacemaker implantation also uses right atrial and ventricular pacing leads, in addition to a left ventricle lead advanced through the coronary sinus into a vein that runs along the ventricular free wall. This permits simultaneous pacing of both ventricles to allow resynchronization of the left ventricle septum and free wall. MODE OF OPERATION: Permanent pacing systems consist of an implantable pulse generator that contains a battery and electronic circuitry, together with 1 (single-chamber pacemaker) or 2 (dual-chamber pacemaker) leads. Leads conduct intrinsic atrial or ventricular signals to the sensing circuitry and deliver the pulse generator charge to the myocardium (muscle of the heart). COMPLICATIONS OF BIVENTRICULAR PACEMAKER IMPLANTATION: The complications that may arise when a BiV pacemaker is implanted are similar to those that occur with standard pacemaker implantation, including pneumothorax, perforation of the great vessels or the myocardium, air embolus, infection, bleeding, and arrhythmias. Moreover, left ventricular pacing through the coronary sinus can be associated with rupture of the sinus as another complication. CONCLUSION OF 2003 REVIEW OF BIVENTRICULAR PACEMAKERS BY THE MEDICAL ADVISORY SECRETARIAT: The randomized controlled trials (RCTs) the Medical Advisory Secretariat retrieved analyzed chronic HF patients that were assessed for up to 6 months. Other studies have been prospective, but nonrandomized, not double-blinded, uncontrolled and/or have had a limited or uncalculated sample size. Short-term studies have focused on acute hemodynamic analyses. The authors of the RCTs reported improved cardiac function and QoL up to 6 months after BiV pacemaker implantation; therefore, there is level 1 evidence that patients in ventricular dyssynchrony who remain symptomatic after medication might benefit from this technology. Based on evidence made available to the Medical Advisory Secretariat by a manufacturer, (8) it appears that these 6-month improvements are maintained at 12-month follow-up. To date, however, there is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of combined ICD/BiV devices in patients with chronic HF with prolonged QRS intervals. SUMMARY OF UPDATED FINDINGS SINCE THE 2003 REVIEW: Since the Medical Advisory Secretariat's review in 2003 of biventricular pacemakers, 2 large RCTs have been published: COMPANION (9) and CARE-HF. (10) The characteristics of each trial are shown in Table 1. The COMPANION trial had a number of major methodological limitations compared with the CARE-HF trial.

    "63": "The ability of thiol-containing reducing agents to activate transcription factors leading to changes in gene expression and enzyme activities provides an additional mechanism to potentially protect against radiation-induced cell killing. Manganese superoxide dismutase (Sod2) is one such gene whose expression levels have been shown to be elevated after exposure to the thiol compounds WR-1065 and N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), resulting in an increase in radiation resistance. To further characterize this effect, SA-NH sarcoma cells, both wild-type and a clone stably transfected with a plasmid containing an IkappaBalpha gene mutated at serines 32 and 36, which prevents the inducible phosphorylation of these residues and the subsequent activation of NFkappaB (SA-NH+mIkappaBalpha1), were grown to confluence and then exposed to amifostine's free thiol WR-1065 at a concentration of 4 mM for 30 min. Effects of thiol exposure on NFKB activation in SA-NH+mIkappaBalpha1 cells were determined by a gel shift assay, and changes in Sod2 protein levels in these cells 24 h after exposure to 40 microM or 4 mM WR-1065 were measured by Western blot analysis and compared with wild-type cells exposed to the NFkappaB inhibitor BAY 11-7082. Changes in radiation response, measured immediately after thiol exposure or 24 h later, were determined using a colony-forming assay and were correlated with NFKB activation and Sod2 protein levels. The effects of captopril, mesna and NAC, each at a dose of 4 mM, on radiation response were also determined and contrasted with those of WR-1065. Only WR-1065 and captopril protected SA-NH cells when present during irradiation, i.e. 1.57 and 1.31 times increase in survival at 2 Gy, respectively. All four thiols were protective if irradiation with 2 Gy occurred 24 h later; i.e. increases in survival of 1.40, 1.22, 1.35, and 1.25 times were found for WR-1065, captopril, mesna and NAC, respectively. This delayed radioprotective effect correlated with elevated Sod2 protein levels in wild-type SA-NH tumor cells but was not observed in SA-NH+mIkappaBalpha1 cells, indicating that interference with thiol-induced NFKB activation abrogates this delayed radioprotective effect. Because the delayed radioprotective effect is readily demonstrable at a radiation dose of 2 Gy 24 h after exposure to clinically approved thiol-containing drugs such as amifostine, captopril, mesna and NAC, it suggests a new potential concern regarding the issue of tumor protection and the use of these agents in cancer therapy.", 
    "64": "Preterax is the first fixed very- low - dose combination of an angiotensin--converting enzyme inhibitor and a diuretic for first line treatment of hypertension. Its antihypertensive efficacy is remarkable due to the presence of 2 drugs with additional effects. The tolerance is also excellent, with adverse effects similar to placebo. The 24 h blood pressure control is maintained. If necessary, the dose can be doubled (BiPreterax). The medical practitioner must keep in mind that it is an association of perindopril 2 mg and indapamide 0.625 mg with their own contra-indications. These low dose associations are now recommended as one of the 2 options to initiate an antihypertensive drug treatment, with the hope of an improvement in the percentage of well controlled blood pressure in the hypertensive population. Let us remember that the blood pressure target to be reached is at least < 140/90 mmHg. Up till now, no antihypertensive class has demonstrated a superiority over the others. Only the blood pressure fall magnitude is important to prevent cardiovascular complications.",

The following retrospective study was designed to explore the safety of these drugs in the early posttransplant period and determine appropriate clinical criteria for starting these medications. The records of all adult renal transplants performed between January 1997 and December 2000 (N = 290) were reviewed. All patients started on ACE or ARB for treatment of hypertension within 90 days of their transplant were included in the analysis (n = 17). Controls (n = 19) were patients who were treated with a calcium channel blocker (CCB) for hypertension. Cases and controls were matched for gender and type of transplant, living or cadaver. Patients were considered to be enrolled whey they met the following criteria: hypertension, serum creatinine < or =3.0 mg/dL, or falling 1 mg/dL/d and serum potassium < or =5.5 mEq/L. Exclusion criteria were coexistent pancreas transplant, anaphylaxis to ACE, and use of ACE or ARB for treatment of posttransplant erythrocytosis. There were no differences between cases and controls in hemoglobin or serum potassium concentrations or calculated glomerular filtration rate at 3, 6, and 9 months. In renal transplant patients with reasonable allograft function, administration of ACE and ARB to treat hypertension in the early posttransplant period appears to be well tolerated and not associated with excess hyperkalemia, anemia, or acute renal dysfunction.",

RPPGF binds to a peptide of the thrombin cleavage site on PAR4. Recombinant wild-type and mutated exodomain of human PAR4 was prepared. The N-terminal arginine on RPPGF binds to the P2 position or proline46 on PAR4 to block thrombin cleavage.

In this study, (1) Transports of cephalexin (CEX) and L-phenylalanine (L-Phe) across Caco-2 monolayers were measured and compared with those of passively transported drugs, (2) Inhibitory effects of various drugs on the transport of [(14)C]glycylsarcosine (Gly-Sar) across Caco-2 monolayers were measured and correlated with their in vivo permeability to rat small intestine, (3) Intracellular pH-change induced by co-transport of drugs with proton into Caco-2 cells was monitored by using Fluorometric Imaging Plate Reader (FLIPR, Molecular Devices Corp.). Concentration-dependent transport was observed in Caco-2 monolayers for CEX and L-Phe, although their permeability was relatively low compared to those of passively transported drugs. Inhibitory effects of various drugs including beta-lactam antibiotics and angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitors on the transport of Gly-Sar correlated well with their in vivo permeability to rat small intestine. It was demonstrated that CEX, but not cefazolin, induced gradual decrease in the intracellular pH of Caco-2 cells. The degree of intracellular pH-change caused by various drugs showed a sigmoidal or saturable relationship with their permeability to rat small intestine. These in vitro approaches with Caco-2 cells should be useful to evaluate in vivo intestinal permeability of drugs mediated by PepT1, suggesting a possibility of high throughput screening of drug absorption.",

On each medication the second exercise was separated from the first by 15 min of rest and the third exercise was performed 90 min after the second to control for training. The time to 0.1 mV ST depression and rate pressure product at 0.1 mV ST depression increased significantly in all groups during exercise two compared with exercise one.

Thus ischaemic preconditioning and warm up angina are likely to have differing pharmacological profiles suggesting a diverse underlying mechanism.", 
    "90": "The metabolic syndrome is strongly associated with insulin resistance and consists of a constellation of factors such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia that raise the risk for cardiovascular diseases and diabetes mellitus. Indeed, hypertension occurs approximately twice as frequently in patients with diabetes compared with in non-diabetic controls. Conversely, hypertensive patients are more likely than normotensive persons to develop diabetes. In addition, up to 75% of CVD in diabetic patients can be attributed to hypertension. Therefore, the primary goals of treating hypertensive patients with insulin resistance are prevention of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular events. Then, what is the optimal anti-hypertensive approach to target organ protection in these patients? Several clinical trials suggest that the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a pivotal role in the pathogensis of insulin resistance and CVD in diabetes. Interruption of the RAS with angiotensin-coverting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) has been shown to prevent the onset of diabetes in hypertensive patients and to reduce cardiovascular and renal disease progression in diabetic patients with hypertension. However, whether we should recommend ARBs for insulin resistant-hypertensive patients or type 2 diabetic patients without nephropathy due to its insulin-sensitizing property remains to be clarified. Recently, telmisartan, an ARB, was found to act as a patrtial agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma). PPAR-gamma influences the gene expression involved in carbohydrate metabolism, and pioglitazone and rosiglitazone, ligands for PPAR-gamma, improve insulin resistance in diabetic patients. Furthermore, there is a growing body of evidence that activators of PPAR-gamma exert anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative and anti-proliferative effects on vascular wall cells, thus decreasing the risks for atherosclerosis. We hypothesize here that due to its unique PPAR-gamma-modulating activity, telmisartan will become a promising 'cardiometabolic sartan', that targets both diabetes and CVD in hypertensive patients. In this paper, we would like to propose the possible ways of testing our hypothesis. Does telmisartan reduce the development of diabetes and CVD in insulin resistant patients pretreated with maximal doses of other ARBs? Does co-treatment with an activator of PPAR-gamma attenuate the effects of telmisartan in these patients? These clinical studies will provide further information whether the beneficial cardiometabolic actions of telmisartan could be ascribed to its PPAR-gamma-inducing property.",

Clinic and ambulatory blood pressure measurements and clinical laboratory evaluation were performed at the end of the placebo run-in and active treatment phases. Both telmisartan and perindopril significantly (p < 0.0001) reduced clinic systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) compared with baseline values. Also, both drugs significantly (p < 0.0001) reduced 24-h mean ambulatory SBP and DBP compared with baseline. Comparison of the mean hourly antihypertensive activities showed that the reduction in mean ambulatory DBP for the last 8 h of the dosing interval was significantly greater (p < 0.05) in telmisartan-treated patients. A 24-h mean DBP of <85 mmHg was observed in 66.6% of the telmisartan-treated patients but in only 46.6% of the perindopril-treated patients (p < 0.05). It is concluded that telmisartan and perindopril both produce significant reductions in clinic SBP and DBP, but the mean reduction in ambulatory DBP during the last 8 h of the dosing interval is greater in patients treated with telmisartan.",

After 4 weeks' treatment, if a patient's DBP was > or = 90 mmHg, the dose was increased to telmisartan 80 mg or losartan 100 mg, respectively. The results show that mean trough seated blood pressure was reduced significantly more in the telmisartan group than that in the losartan group (SBP 12.5 mmHg vs. 9.4 mmHg, p = 0.037; DBP 10.9 mmHg vs. 9.3 mmHg, p = 0.030). The overall DBP response rate (reduction from baseline in mean seated DBP > or = 10 mmHg and/or a mean seated DBP <90 mmHg) at the end of the study in the telmisartan group was higher than that in losartan group (70.1% vs. 58.7%, p = 0.020). At both the low and high doses, the DBP response rates for telmisartan were significantly higher than those for losartan (telmisartan 40 mg vs. losartan 50 mg: 46.3% vs. 32.5%, p = 0.010; telmisartan 80 mg vs. losartan 100 mg: 79.3% vs. 65.3%, p = 0.008). Adverse events with the two treatments were comparable (telmisartan vs. losartan 23.2% vs. 22.9%, p = 0.952). Most events were mild in intensity and abated within 72 h.

After an initial 2-week placebo run-in phase, patients were randomised in a double-blind, double-dummy fashion to receive either telmisartan 40 mg or losartan 50 mg. If blood pressure control (diastolic blood pressure [DBP] <90 mmHg or > or = 10 mmHg reduction in DBP) was achieved after 4 weeks, the dose was maintained for the second 4 weeks of the active treatment phase; if not, the dose was doubled to telmisartan 80 mg or losartan 100 mg, respectively, for the second 4 weeks of double-blind treatment. Telmisartan 40-80 mg (n = 86) was as effective as losartan 50-100 mg (n = 90) in reducing trough seated DBP (11.1 vs. 8.7 mmHg, p = 0.144), and was significantly more effective than losartan in reducing trough seated systolic blood pressure (SBP) (22.1 vs. 16.5 mmHg, p = 0.032) and standing SBP (21.0 vs. 16.3 mmHg, p = 0.033).

The safety profiles of both drugs were very similar; both drugs were well tolerated. In conclusion, once-daily telmisartan 80 mg is more effective than once-daily atenolol 50 mg in lowering SBP with no negative chronotropism.

Both SBP and DBP were decreased in both treatment groups, but the reductions were statistically different in favour of telmisartan (SBP, p = 0.013; DBP, p = 0.002). The incidence of adverse effects was lower in the telmisartan group, with the absence of cough.

Maximal response to noradrenaline in the presence of extracellular Ca2+ is not affected by hypertension or by the antihypertensive treatment. The extracellular Ca2+-independent contractile responses increased with age in iliac, tail, and small mesenteric arteries (SMA) and were further increased in SHR in SMA from both young and adult animals and in the main mesenteric artery of adult SHR. In main mesenteric artery, this increased contraction in SHR was associated with a higher increase in cytosolic [Ca2+] mobilized by noradrenaline without changes in the total stored Ca2+. Acute or chronic treatment with captopril abolished the differences observed between WKY and SHR in the noradrenaline-induced contraction in mesenteric arteries loaded in Ca2+-free medium. In contrast, animals acutely treated with prazosin or chronically treated with either prazosin or nifedipine exhibit the same differences in Ca2+ handling than untreated rats.

Eighteen patients with a proteinuria >1 g/24 h after 6 mo of treatment with ramipril at 5 mg/d were assigned to receive in random order ramipril at 10 mg/d, valsartan at 160 mg/d, or combined ramipril at 5 mg/d and valsartan at 80 mg/d in addition to their antihypertensive treatment. The treatment periods lasted 4 wk and were separated by a 4-wk washout with ramipril at 5 mg/d. At the end of this crossover sequence, patients received combined ramipril at 5 mg/d, valsartan at 80 mg/d, and an increased furosemide dosage for an additional 4-wk period. The primary end point was the urinary protein/creatinine ratio for two 24-h urine collections at the end of each treatment period. No significant differences were noted between the study end points of the ramipril 10, valsartan 160, and combined ramipril 5 and valsartan 80 treatment groups. However, the urinary protein/creatinine ratio was lower with combined ramipril 5 and valsartan 80-increased furosemide dosage than with valsartan 160 and combined ramipril 5 and valsartan 80, with a similar tendency compared with ramipril 10. Combined ramipril 5 and valsartan 80-increased furosemide dosage decreased systolic home BP and increased serum creatinine but did not significantly increase the number of symptomatic hypotension cases compared with the other three treatments. Thus, in patients with severe proteinuria and hypertension, a cautious increase in diuretic dosage in addition to combined angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers decreases proteinuria and BP but may expose the patient to prerenal failure.", 
    "114": "Recently, plasma exchange (PE) has been added to the treatment regimen for patients with steroid-, cyclophosphamide-, and cyclosporine-resistant nephrotic syndrome. This is a case report of a female patient with severe acute renal failure (ARF) during the relapse of steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) who recovered completely after PE and became steroid-sensitive in further follow-up of 48 months. An 8-year-old girl was referred to Nephrology Department of the University Children's Hospital due to relapse of SRNS complicated with ARF. Her nephrotic syndrome (mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis) was diagnosed at the age of 17 months. During the following 6 years, she was given several therapeutic regimens including pulse prednisolone, cyclophosphamide, Cyclosporine (CyA), but she continued to have frequent relapses and during the last six months she was steroid- and cyclosporine-resistant. Three days before admission, she was febrile, had cellulites of the lower abdominal wall, diarrhea, vomiting, hypovolemic shock with generalized edema, severe hypoproteinemia and hypoalbuminemia. In a local hospital, she was treated with fresh frozen plasma, albumin, methylprednisolone, furosemide and antibiotics, but she became anuric and was referred to our hospital. There were no signs of hemolysis. Anuria lasted for 12 days. She was discharged after 42 days in remission with normal GFR. Principal treatment included: 13 sequential hemodialysis sessions (30% of body weight was removed as excess volume), 6 PE, corticosteroids, CyA, ACE inhibitor, antibiotics, antimycotics, and cimetidine. Six PE sessions were performed every other day. In further 48-month follow-up, while under the treatment of CyA the patient had a few steroid-sensitive relapses, the first being 6 months after PE. The second kidney biopsy showed focal segmental glomerulosclerosis with no signs of apparent CyA nephrotoxicity. \"Malignant\" course of disease in our patient was a good reason to introduce PE into the treatment. Since PE was the only additional mode of treatment, it is believed that its effect was crucial for milder activity of the disease.", 
    "115": "The objective of our study was to evaluate the changes of blood pressure (BP), urinary protein excretion (PRT/Cr) and renal function (GFR) after long-term administration of ACE inhibitor, ramipril. This prospective trial, a part of the European Multicentric Escape Study, included 14 patients (5 girls and 9 boys), mean-age 11 years, with congenital renal malformations. The basic inclusion criteria were stable chronic renal failure (CRF) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 50 percentile defined by 24-hour ABPM or earlier antihypertensive medication. The patients were studied 6 months before and up to 36 months after the introduction of ramipril therapy. The dosage of ramipril ranged from 4.7 to 7.7 mg/ m2 SBA, mean 37.8 (+/- 4.03) mg/m2 SBA. The patients were controlled every two months for BP, proteinuria and GFR, while 24-hour ABPM was performed in 6 months. The significant decrease of regular and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure (ABP), systolic, diastolic and MAP, was found within the first months of treatment, while ramipril-induced reduction of proteinuria and slowing down of GFR were delayed. BP did not differ significantly among patients, but antiproteinuric effect and influence on GFR showed large individual variations. Antiproteinuric and antihypertensive effects of ramipril correlated with underlying proteinuria, GFR and blood pressure. However, there was no constant relationship between changes of proteinuria and BP. Ramipril has been shown to: lower BP significantly, decrease proteinuria slowly, and significantly decelerate GFR after 18 months of treatment. Considering favorable preliminary results of lower BP, decrease of proteinuria and decelerated GFR, an optimal renal protection by long-term therapy with ACE inhibitors may be expected in children with CRF caused by congenital renal malformations.", 
    "116": "Nitric oxide (NO) derived from neuronal NO synthase (nNOS) in the macula densa is a modulator of tubuloglomerular feedback. However, little is known about the regulation of the afferent arteriolar diameter by NO from the macula densa in salt-sensitive hypertension. We investigated the relationship between nNOS in the macula densa and the afferent arteriolar diameter in deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertensive rats treated with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or thiazide for 5 weeks. DOCA rats had reduced nNOS expression in the macula densa compared to controls and reduction of NO production evaluated with 4,5-diaminofluorescein diacetate in the juxtaglomerular apparatus (JGA). Treatment with ACE inhibitor and thiazide increased nNOS and NO production in the JGA. The diameter of the afferent arteriole observed by SEM using microvascular casts was smaller in DOCA rats compared to control rats, and ACE inhibitor or thiazide dilated the afferent arteriole with a positive correlation to nNOS immunoreactivity in the macula densa. In conclusion, the afferent arteriolar diameter might be regulated by NO derived from nNOS in the macula densa in DOCA-salt hypertensive rats.",

    "122": "Several lines of evidence suggest that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and some angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) may improve insulin sensitivity and decrease the risk for type 2 diabetes. It is widely assumed that the potential antidiabetic properties of these agents are largely mediated by their ability to interfere with the adverse metabolic effects of angiotensin II. However, recent studies suggest that ACE inhibitors might improve glucose metabolism primarily through effects on kinin-nitric oxide pathways. In addition, one ARB in particular, telmisartan, has been found to effectively activate the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma), a well-known target for insulin-sensitizing, antidiabetic drugs. Thus, the beneficial metabolic effects of some ACE inhibitors and ARBs may go well beyond their effects on the renin-angiotensin system. Moreover, the identification of telmisartan as a unique angiotensin II receptor antagonist with selective PPARgamma modulating ability suggests new opportunities for developing third-generation ARBs and PPARgamma activators, with enhanced potential for treating hypertension, diabetes and the metabolic syndrome.",

Target vessel revascularization is necessary in 15% of patients who receive a stent. Recent advances in the development of drug-eluting stents have reduced these numbers tremendously. However refinement of antirestenotic therapies remains obligatory. The emerging interest in more physiological antirestenotic therapies might unchain an interest in the well-known inhibitors of the rennin-angiotensin system (RAS), the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and the angiotensin II type I receptor blockers. Contradictory results overshadow the discussion of whether intervention in the RAS could prevent in-stent restenosis. This review discusses the pathophysiology of in-stent restenosis, the role of the RAS in in-stent restenosis, and the possible role of RAS intervention in the prevention of in-stent restenosis.",

Our results show that biological thiol contents are between 3-349 nM/g wet weight in vegetables and 4-136 nM/g wet weight in fruits. CAP is only found in asparagus (28 nM/g wet weight). Furthermore, none of the biological thiols analyzed were found in cabbages, red grapes, blackberries, apples, and peaches. Therefore, various vegetables and fruits differ significantly in their thiol contents. Oxidation of these important thiols may occur and result in the production of toxic byproducts, if they are exposed to radiation and ozone treatment for sterilization purposes. Further studies should be performed to monitor the levels of these biological thiols.",

However, in the past few years, scattered reports of angioedema associated with ARBs have appeared in the medical literature. We performed a retrospective chart review from January 1, 1998, through June 30, 2003, and a review of the literature. During this time, we managed head and neck angioedema induced by ACEIs (n = 27) and ARBs (n = 4) in 31 patients. All of them had significant mucosal swelling, and in some of them dyspnea and dysphagia coexisted. The most frequently involved areas were the oral tongue (13 cases), uvula and soft palate (5 cases), and larynx, mouth floor, and lips (3 cases each). Angioedema may be a more common complication of ACEI and/or ARB use than originally thought. This complication may occur after long-term use of these drugs.

The purpose of the present study was to assess whether combination therapy with low doses of both, ineffective when given alone, might synergistically exert protective effects. Lisinopril, candesartan, or a combination of both in drinking water was administered to 10-week-old male WBN/Kob rats for 10 weeks. Parameters of inflammation and fibrosis, positive immunostaining for alpha-smooth muscle actin, and gene expression of cytokine and growth factors were assessed, as well as circulating renin-angiotensin system components. Dose-dependent effects of combination therapy were also investigated. Only combination therapy attenuated gross alterations in the pancreas, as quantitatively confirmed by increases in pancreatic weights and decreases in myeloperoxidase activity, hydroxyproline content, histologic scores, relative fibrosis area, and relative area of alpha-smooth muscle actin-positive cells. Combination therapy suppressed up-regulation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, platelet-derived growth factor-receptor beta, and transforming growth factor-beta1 mRNA in the pancreas. Dose dependence of combination therapy was recognized with reference to improvement in these parameters. The conclusions are that combination therapy synergistically alleviated pancreatic inflammation and fibrosis in male WBN/Kob rats. This effect may be related to suppression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, platelet-derived growth factor-receptor beta, and transforming growth factor-beta1 mRNA. Compared with the either therapy alone, combination therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker may be more beneficial for treating chronic pancreatitis.",

Control of risk factors includes treating hypertension, diabetes, and coronary artery disease, and eliminating the use of alcohol and tobacco. All patients with heart failure should be taking an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin-receptor blocker. In the absence of contraindications, an ACE inhibitor is preferred. In most patients, physicians should consider adding a beta blocker to ACE-inhibitor therapy. In patients with severe heart failure, spironolactone is a useful addition to baseline drug therapy, as is carvedilol (substitute carvedilol if patient is already taking a beta blocker). Patients with stable heart failure should be encouraged to begin and maintain a regular aerobic exercise program. Digoxin therapy may reduce the likelihood of hospitalization but does not reduce mortality. It must be monitored closely, with a target dosage level of 0.5 to 1.1 ng per mL. Symptoms may be controlled with the use of diuretics and restricted dietary sodium. Finally, patient education, with the patient's active participation in the care, is a key strategy in the management of heart failure.

Recent attempts to control proteinuria and morbidity with plasmapheresis (PP) have met with limited success. Our experience with the use of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and angiotensin blockade (AB) in the management of refractory FSGS pre transplant suggested its potential benefit in post-transplant recurrence. This report presents our 25-year experience in pediatric renal transplantation of patients with FSGS divided into two treatment eras: Era 1-prior to use of daclizumab (anti-IL-2R) and Era 2-after daclizumab. A total of 179 pediatric patients were transplanted during the 25-year period. FSGS was confirmed in 27 (15%); 16 of 28 allografts (57%) had recurrence of FSGS during the post-transplant period. In Era 1, only 6 of 16 (38%) recurred in the allograft, while 10 of 12 (83%) recurred during Era 2. The odds ratio of recurrence of FSGS in the allograft after induction with anti-IL-2R was 8.3 (95% confidence interval=1.3-52, P =0.02). Only 2 patients in Era 1 received PP, while 10 in Era 2 were entered into an intensive PP protocol followed by maintenance with AB consisting of angiotensin receptor blockers alone, or in combination with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Although proteinuria decreased an average of 80+/-16% with PP, the response was variable and severe morbid edema persisted in poor responders. Maximum benefit occurred with the addition of AB and MMF. After a follow-up of 27+/-15 months, proteinuria has shown a sustained decrease of 94+/-8% below baseline. In conclusion, our experience suggests that, with recurrent FSGS, a limited course of PP followed by maintenance therapy with AB and MMF improves symptoms and may preserve allograft function.",

This is because of their immediate and saturable binding to an ACE pool which is partly circulating (and contributing to the measured plasma concentration), and partly noncirculating (tissular), being anchored to the endothelium of vessels and not measurable by the analytical technique. A physiologically based model is required to allow appropriate interpretation of the different phases of the disposition curve of ACEI. The protracted terminal phase observed for all ACEIs is not a conventional elimination phase but a phase dependent on ACEI dissociation from ACE. In contrast, the phase which reflects ACEI elimination (and which is interpreted as a distribution phase for a conventional drug) has a short half-life, thus explaining the absence of drug accumulation during repeated dosing and mild kidney failure. ACE inhibition is the surrogate endpoint generally selected for establishing a PK/PD relationship and for simulating dosage regimen scenarios in order to decide on the appropriate dosage regimen for ACEIs.", 
    "172": "Rates of end-stage renal disease in the Aboriginal community have been increasing over the past two decades, particularly in the northern and more remote areas of Australia, and especially in disadvantaged communities. Proteinuria predicts the rate of loss of renal function and is common in young adults and virtually universal in those over 50 years old. Cumulative independent risk factors include low birthweight, recurrent skin infections, adult obesity, diabetes or its precursors, smoking, excessive alcohol intake and a family history of renal disease. A plausible theory is that intrauterine malnutrition permanently reduces total nephron numbers, which are then overworked in adulthood by the metabolic stresses of obesity (from excess alcohol and poor diet), blood pressure and infections, while starved of blood supply through smoking. Although renal disease is often only detected when already established, there are great rewards for active medical intervention. Control of blood pressure (preferentially using angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin-II receptor blockers (AIIRB) in combination) can often stop or even reverse kidney damage, despite ongoing poor diabetic control. Adequately funded kidney health programmes with active Aboriginal Health Worker involvement are enormously cost-effective: tight blood pressure control at least halves the rate of disease progression, and every year of dialysis deferred for one patient could fund the appointment of two more health workers. Addressing the underlying social causes for this epidemic is critical.", 
    "173": "Histopathological changes were investigated in the tubulointerstitium and in the capillaries of male Wistar rats with lithium-induced nephropathy using stereological methods. Two antihypertensive drugs with opposite effects on the renin-angiotensin system, an ACE inhibitor (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor) and a thiazide diuretic, modified the nephropathy. Generally, there was a significant positive correlation between the reduction in GFR (glomerular filtration rate) and the reduction in the volume of intact tubular structures and interstitial capillaries. A significant negative correlation was seen between the reduction in GFR and the increase in tubulocapillary distance and the absolute volume of interstitial connective tissue, respectively. Treatment with perindopril, and to some extent hydrochlorothiazide, reversed the rise in systolic blood pressure associated with lithium-induced nephropathy but did not affect the progression to terminal uraemia, the structural renal changes or the mortality. In conclusion, severe tubular and capillary changes are seen in this model of chronic renal failure. Tubular atrophy is associated with a decrease in interstitial capillaries and with an increase in the tubulocapillary distance. Systemic hypertension or activation of the renin-angiotensin system may not be important factors for the progression to terminal renal failure.",

Including other diseases secondary to atherosclerosis makes the likelihood of developing cardiovascular disease even greater. Lacking an adequate screening test for subclinical cardiovascular disease, or for those in whom it will develop, our current national prevention and treatment strategy is to screen for risk factors of coronary artery disease (CAD), treating only those at greatest risk. Although pharmacologic lipid-lowering therapy has proven to be effective at reducing the development and manifestations of CAD, as well as remarkably safe, our current strategy withholds treatment of many in whom cardiovascular disease will ultimately develop. An alternate strategy is to implement universal lipid-lowering therapy, initiated in men at age 30 and at the time of menopause in women. Such a policy would not limit effective treatment to only those at greatest risk. While the cost of such a program would be substantial, although decreasing with the increasing availability of generic agents, this must be weighed against the direct and indirect costs of cardiovascular disease, estimated to be $368 billion in 2004. If such a strategy were implemented, the goal of screening would shift from CAD detection to detection of a disease burden such that therapies shown to decrease events among those with manifest CAD would be expected to benefit. Such treatments currently include aspirin, beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and revascularization.",

Substrate specificity of ACE catalytic domains (C- and N-domains) was assessed in an effort to design selective substrates for the C-domain. Initially, we defined the S(1) specificity by preparing a library with the general structure Abz-GXXZXK(Dnp)-OH [Abz = o-aminobenzoic acid, K(Dnp) = N(epsilon)-2,4-dinitrophenyllysine, and X is a random residue], where Z was successively occupied with one of the 19 natural amino acids with the exception of Cys. The peptides containing Arg and Leu in the P(1) position had higher C-domain selectivity. In the sublibraries Abz-GXXRZK(Dnp)-OH, Abz-GXZRXK(Dnp)-OH, and Abz-GZXRXK(Dnp)-OH, Arg was fixed at P(1) so we could define the C-domain selectivity of the S(1)', S(2), and S(3) subsites. On the basis of the results from these libraries, we synthesized peptides Abz-GVIRFK(Dnp)-OH and Abz-GVILFK(Dnp)-OH which contain the most favorable residues for C-domain selectivity. Systematic reduction of the length of these two peptides resulted in Abz-LFK(Dnp)-OH, which demonstrated the highest selectivity for the recombinant ACE C-domain (k(cat)/K(m) = 36.7 microM(-1) s(-1)) versus the N-domain (k(cat)/K(m) = 0.51 microM(-1) s(-1)).

Rat IRPTCs were cultured for 2 weeks in high-glucose (25 mM) or normal-glucose (5 mM) medium plus angiotensin II (Ang II) with or without a superoxide scavenger (tiron), or inhibitors of: NADPH oxidase (diphenylene iodinium, DPI), Ang II type 1 and 2 receptors (losartan and PD123319), angiotensin-converting enzyme (perindopril), protein kinase C (GF 109203X), or glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amino-transferase (azaserine). Cellular generation of ROS, and ANG and renin mRNA levels were assessed by lucigenin assay and specific reverse transcriptase-PCR respectively. Phosphorylation of p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p44/42 MAPK) was evaluated by western blotting. Prolonged exposure of IRPTCs to high concentrations of glucose or Ang II evoked generation of ROS and resistance to the insulin-induced inhibition of expression of the ANG gene and of p44/42 MAPK phosphorylation. Co-incubation of IRPTCs with tiron, DPI, losartan, PD123319, perindopril, GF 109203X or azaserine prevented ROS generation, restoring the inhibitory action of insulin on ANG gene expression and on p44/42 MAPK phosphorylation. In conclusion, our studies demonstrate that blockade of both ROS generation and activation of the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system improves the inhibitory action of insulin on ANG gene expression in IRPTCs in conditions of high glucose.",

At 28 weeks' gestational age, severe anhydramnios associated with high beta2-microglobulin levels in the fetal blood cord was observed. Upon discontinuation of valsartan, fetal renal prognosis improved. In this case, using the Naranjo probability scale, the renal insufficiency of the child was probably related to valsartan. At the age of 2.5 years, the child presented with only mild chronic renal insufficiency. Growth parameters were within the normal range, and there was no evidence of developmental delay.",

In 6 cases, fetal or neonatal death occurred; in 2 cases, pregnancy was terminated because of complete anhydramnios or fetal abnormalities; in 1 case, renal insufficiency persisted at 8 months of age; in 2 cases, kidney function was fairly normal at birth; and in 4 cases, including the one described here, neonatal renal failure improved in the first year of life.",

All patients received the same anesthetic protocol and same dopamine infusion protocol (2 mg/kg(-1)/min(-1)) during the study. In addition to dopamine infusion 15 patients received enalaprilat infusion (0.06 mg/kg(-1)/hr(-1)) during CPB. Blood creatinine, urea levels, and creatinine clearance (CLcr) were measured and cardiac output (CO) was calculated by echocardiography preoperatively and on the 6th postoperative day. Mean arterial pressure (MAP), central venous pressure (CVP), systemic vascular resistance (SVR) measurements were recorded during the operation and during postoperative 24 hours.",

However, medical management of heart failure in this patient group represents a challenge because of complex hemodynamics and a lack of evidence from large randomized controlled trials to guide therapy. This article will review the evidence of the use angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and beta-blockers (BBs) in left heart failure, discuss the mechanisms of heart failure as they pertain to congenital heart disease and review the limited literature of the use of neurohormonal antagonists in congenital heart disease. Some recommendations for use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers in heart failure due various congenital heart lesions are offered. Well-designed clinical trials are urgently needed to extend the impressive reductions in morbidity and mortality achieved with neurohormonal blockade in left ventricular (LV) heart failure to adults with congenital heart disease.", 
    "225": "Experimental studies suggest that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors with high tissue affinity confer a greater degree of vascular renin-angiotensin system suppression than those with low tissue affinity despite similar suppression of the circulating renin-angiotensin system. To test this hypothesis in a clinical setting, we randomized subjects with chronic heart failure to receive the low tissue affinity ACE inhibitor enalapril or the high tissue affinity ACE inhibitor trandolapril, and assessed the degree of circulating and vascular renin-angiotensin system suppression. Vascular renin-angiotensin system suppression was determined by measuring the pressor response to intravenous injections of angiotensin I. Circulating renin-angiotensin system suppression was determined by measuring plasma angiotensin II. Vascular and circulating renin-angiotensin system suppression, endothelial function (flow-mediated vasodilation), and maximal exercise capacity (peak oxygen uptake) were assessed after a 4-week run-in period on open-label enalapril 40 mg/day and after 8 weeks of randomized double-blind treatment with enalapril 40 mg/day or trandolapril 4 mg/day. Twenty-six men and 4 women (mean age 52 +/- 11 years; mean left ventricular ejection fraction 25 +/- 9%; New York Heart Association class II [n = 16] and III [n = 14]) were studied. After a 2-month randomized treatment period, vascular renin-angiotensin system suppression, circulating renin-angiotensin system suppression, endothelial function, and exercise capacity did not differ between subjects treated with enalapril and those treated with trandolapril. Despite substantial differences in the tissue affinity of enalapril and trandolapril, the degree of vascular renin-angiotensin system suppression achieved with these agents did not differ in subjects with chronic heart failure during long-term therapy.", 
    "226": "A novel method (MOLPRINT 3D) for virtual screening and the elucidation of ligand-receptor binding patterns is introduced that is based on environments of molecular surface points. The descriptor uses points relative to the molecular coordinates, thus it is translationally and rotationally invariant. Due to its local nature, conformational variations cause only minor changes in the descriptor. If surface point environments are combined with the Tanimoto coefficient and applied to virtual screening, they achieve retrieval rates comparable to that of two-dimensional (2D) fingerprints. The identification of active structures with minimal 2D similarity (\"scaffold hopping\") is facilitated. In combination with information-gain-based feature selection and a naive Bayesian classifier, information from multiple molecules can be combined and classification performance can be improved. Selected features are consistent with experimentally determined binding patterns. Examples are given for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, and thromboxane A2 antagonists.",

It is interesting to study the influence of Eudragit E, as a coating polymer, on the stability of enalapril maleate. The reaction kinetics of the solid-state degradation process of pure enalapril maleate and Eudragit E/enalapril maleate mixture with different weight ratios were examined. The mechanism of solid-state interaction between Eudragit E and enalapril maleate was also discussed.",

The thermal-dependent FTIR spectra show that not only the formation of DKP but also the six-membered cyclic anhydride occurred in the enalapril maleate/Eudragit E mixture in the heating process. Two pathways for solid-sate interaction were proposed. The stability of enalapril maleate was dependent on the weight ratio of enalapril maleate and Eudragit E. The activation energy (n = 3) of DKP formation for pure enalapril maleate was about 141.2+/-0.7 kJ/mol, but it was reduced significantly to 86.7+/-0.8 kJ/mol after interaction with Eudragit E (weight ratio: 1:1), suggesting Eudragit E might exacerbate the degradation of enalapril maleate. However, the degradation accelerated by Eudragit E was reduced in high content of Eudragit E.", 
    "231": "When the weight ratio of both components was 1:1, Eudragit E might interact with the carboxyl group of maleic acid to exacerbate the degradation of enalapril maleate. However, the excess amount of Eudragit E might somewhat reduce the degradation of enalapril, due to the interaction that occurred between Eudragit E and carboxyl group of enalapril.", 
    "232": "Essential hypertension is a major cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in the Western world, yet it remains poorly controlled. Single drug-antihypertensive therapy is unsuccessful in up to half of all patients with hypertension; although lack of adherence may account for a proportion of this, there is evidence of considerable variation in the response of different hypertensive patients to different drug classes. A number of algorithms have been proposed in the literature, with a view to predicting an individual's response to different antihypertensive agents. However, even using such algorithms, hypertension control remains problematic, and they are frequently difficult to apply in everyday clinical practice. Initiation of treatment with low-dose combination antihypertensive therapy, using a drug which reduces total body sodium and/or volume in combination with a drug which blocks the renin-angiotensin system, provides an effective and easily applicable means to improve hypertension control in the primary care setting.",

Growth factors and inflammatory agents are the most powerful actors in the neo-vascularization process. Numerous other factors have been shown to modulate blood vessel growth. Among these, we have tested the potential effect of angiotensin II in several in vivo models of angiogenesis. Angiotensin II has pro-angiogenic effects via its AT1 subtype receptor whereas the AT2 angiotensin II receptor has pro-apoptotic and anti-angiogenic properties. Besides its effect on angiotensin II formation, some angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors have pro-angiogenic effect by increasing the local concentration of bradykinin in ischemic tissues and, thus, by activation of its B2 receptor and then NO release. These besides the \"classical\" gene and cellular therapies designed for the treatment of pathological tissue ischemia, alternative strategies using new pharmacological properties of drugs acting on the renin angiotensin system are likely to be possible.",

SARS-CoV spike (S) protein-encoding plasmid induced activations of IL-8 promoter and AP-1, but not NF-kappaB in these cells. Mutation of the AP-1, not the kappaB site, abolished the SARS-CoV S protein-induced IL-8 promoter activity. IL-8 release was effectively induced by vAtEpGS688, a baculovirus exhibiting the aa 17-688 fragment of S protein, and this induction was attenuated by the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 Ab. Recombinant baculovirus expressing different deletion and insertion fragments identified the functional region of S protein from aa 324-688 (particularly the N-terminal aa 324-488 and the C-terminal aa 609-688), which is responsible for IL-8 production. Activations of AP-1 DNA-protein binding and MAPKs after vAtEpGS688 transduction were demonstrated, and SARS-CoV S protein-induced IL-8 promoter activity was inhibited by the specific inhibitors of MAPK cascades. These results suggested that the S protein of SARS-CoV could induce release of IL-8 in the lung cells via activations of MAPKs and AP-1. The identification of the functional domain for IL-8 release will provide for the drug design on targeting specific sequence domains of S protein responsible for initiating the inflammatory response.",

Opinions are divided as to whether it is beneficial or not to stop it prior to operation. A national survey in the UK was carried out on this issue. Questionnaires were sent to 167 currently practicing UK cardiac surgeons, out of which 105 (62%) replied back. Their responses were analyzed. Among the surgeons who replied to the questionnaires, the majority (63%) were of the opinion that the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors leads to vasodilatation resulting in increased usage of fluids, inotropes and vasoconstrictors. However, there was no agreement on the issue of stopping it prior to surgery. Forty one (39%) felt it was beneficial to stop the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors prior to surgery whereas 40 (38%) of them thought it was harmful to stop it. Twenty one (20%) were of the opinion that it made no difference. 39% of respondents practiced stopping the drug prior to planned operation.

Whether these actions depend solely on reduction of angiotensin II (Ang II) generation is still to be determined. This study was undertaken to determine whether enalapril, an ACE inhibitor, prevents atherosclerosis and vascular inflammation induced by Ang II in apolipoprotein E-deficient (apoE-KO) mice. Subcutaneous infusion of Ang II (1.44 mg/(kg day)) for 4 weeks increased blood pressure and accelerated atherosclerosis development in the carotid arteries. The expression of the endothelial adhesion molecules E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), as well as the chemokines monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) was up-regulated in the aortas of Ang II-treated mice. Enalapril co-treatment (25 mg/(kg day), in drinking water) prevented the development of atherosclerosis without affecting blood pressure or circulating cholesterol. In addition to preventing the Ang II-induced over-expression of adhesion molecules and chemokines in the aorta, enalapril up-regulated the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs)-alpha and -gamma, potential anti-inflammatory transcription factors. In the aortic arch, a lesion-prone site, the co-treatment with enalapril reduced the percentage of arterial wall occupied by macrophages and foam cells, medial sclerosis and elastin reduplication.

    "250": "Somatic angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) contains 2 domains (C-domain and N-domain) capable of hydrolyzing angiotensin I (Ang I) and bradykinin. Here we investigated the effect of the selective C-domain and N-domain inhibitors RXPA380 and RXP407 on Ang I-induced vasoconstriction of porcine femoral arteries (PFAs) and bradykinin-induced vasodilation of preconstricted porcine coronary microarteries (PCMAs). Ang I concentration-dependently constricted PFAs. RXPA380, at concentrations >1 mumol/L, shifted the Ang I concentration-response curve (CRC) 10-fold to the right. This was comparable to the maximal shift observed with the ACE inhibitors (ACEi) quinaprilat and captopril. RXP407 did not affect Ang I at concentrations < or =0.1 mmol/L. Bradykinin concentration-dependently relaxed PCMAs. RXPA380 (10 micromol/L) and RXP407 (0.1 mmol/L) potentiated bradykinin, both inducing a leftward shift of the bradykinin CRC that equaled approximately 50% of the maximal shift observed with quinaprilat. Ang I added to blood plasma disappeared with a half life (t(1/2)) of 42+/-3 minutes. Quinaprilat increased the t(1/2) approximately 4-fold, indicating that 71+/-6% of Ang I metabolism was attributable to ACE. RXPA380 (10 micromol/L) and RXP407 (0.1 mmol/L) increased the t(1/2) approximately 2-fold, thereby suggesting that both domains contribute to conversion in plasma. In conclusion, tissue Ang I-II conversion depends exclusively on the ACE C-domain, whereas both domains contribute to conversion by soluble ACE and to bradykinin degradation at tissue sites. Because tissue ACE (and not plasma ACE) determines the hypertensive effects of Ang I, these data not only explain why N-domain inhibition does not affect Ang I-induced vasoconstriction in vivo but also why ACEi exert blood pressure-independent effects at low (C-domain-blocking) doses.", 
    "251": "Expression profiling using microarrays allows for the detailed characterization of the gene networks that regulate an animal's response to environmental stresses. During nutritional restriction, processes such as protein turnover, connective tissue remodeling, and muscle atrophy take place in the skeletal muscle of the animal. These processes and their regulation are of interest in the context of managing livestock for optimal production efficiency and product quality. Here we expand on recent research applying complementary DNA (cDNA) microarray technology to the study of the effect of nutritional restriction on bovine skeletal muscle. Using a custom cDNA microarray of 9,274 probes from cattle muscle and s.c. fat libraries, we examined the differential gene expression profile of the LM from 10 Brahman steers under three different dietary treatments. The statistical approach was based on mixed-model ANOVA and model-based clustering of the BLUP solutions for the gene x diet interaction effect. From the results, we defined a transcript profile of 156 differentially expressed array elements between the weight loss and weight gain diet substrates. After sequence and annotation analyses, the 57 upregulated elements represented 29 unique genes, and the 99 downregulated elements represented 28 unique genes. Most of these co-regulated genes cluster into groups with distinct biological function related to protein turnover and cytoskeletal metabolism and contribute to our mechanistic understanding of the processes associated with remodeling of muscle tissue in response to nutritional stress.",

Female rats underwent a partial aortic ligature between the renal arteries (PAL) or were sham-operated (SHAM). At 6 days of age, offspring of PAL (O-PAL) and SHAM (O-SHAM) dams were injected with isoproterenol (subcutaneously, 500 microg/kg body weight) or vehicle. Pretreatment with captopril (intraperitoneally, 50 mg/kg) on isoproterenol-induced thirst was also studied. Plasma renin activity in dams and hematocrit and osmolality in pups were measured. O-PAL had a greater water intake than O-SHAM. However, they responded similarly to isoproterenol or isoproterenol with captopril pretreatment. Only minor differences in hematocrit and osmolality were found between O-SHAM and O-PAL rats after isoproterenol or vehicle treatment. Beta-adrenergic or angiotensinergic responsivity seems not to be altered in offspring of hyperrenimic, hyperdipsic, and natriophilic dams. Nevertheless, other thirst responses of offspring may be critically dependent upon uterine conditions.", 
    "253": "Excretion of albumin with urine (UAE) in small amounts, i.e. microalbuminuria (MAU), also referred to as \"incipient nephropathy\", has long been considered a marker of early nephropathy and increased cardiovascular risk in the specific setting of diabetes mellitus. However, numerous clinical studies found an association between MAU and other cardiovascular risk factors, target organ damage and risk of cardiovascular disease in clinical contexts different from diabetes and including arterial hypertension. The present article reviews the available evidence on the clinical value of MAU in subjects with primary hypertension. In these subjects, prevalence of MAU varied from about 4% to 46% across different studies and these differences may be explained by the huge intra-individual variability in UAE, discrepancies in the technique of measurement and different definitions of MAU. A direct and continuous association between UAE and blood pressure (BP) has been found in many studies. A continuous association between UAE and left ventricular mass has also been found in most studies. In contrast, it is not yet clear whether the association between UAE and other factors including age, gender, smoking, ethnicity, insulin resistance, lipids and obesity is independent or mediated by confounders, particularly BP. From a prognostic standpoint, several longitudinal studies showed an association between MAU and the risk of future cardiovascular disease. Of particular note, in some of these studies the incidence of major cardiovascular events progressively increased with UAE starting below the conventional MAU thresholds. Thus, besides being a direct risk factor for progressive renal damage, MAU can be considered a marker, which integrates and reflects the long-term level of activity of several other detrimental factors on cardiovascular system. Antihypertensive treatment reduces UAE and such effect may be detected after just a few days of treatment. Among available antihypertensive drugs, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and the angiotensin II receptor antagonists seem to be superior to other antihypertensive drugs in reducing UAE. The dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with an ACE inhibitor and an angiotensin II receptor antagonist is a new and promising approach to control UAE in hypertensive patients. Determination of MAU is recommended in the initial work-up of subjects with primary hypertension.", 
    "254": "There is increasing evidence from both human and experimental studies that at least partial reversal of glomerulosclerosis can be achieved by glomerular remodeling. This requires substantial changes in glomerular architecture, specifically of glomerular capillaries. It was the purpose of the present study to characterize the stereologic and topologic characteristics of glomerular capillaries when partial reversal of glomerular lesions is achieved by high-dose angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor treatment. Sham-operated male Sprague-Dawley rats were compared with subtotally nephrectomized (SNX) rats. The latter were kept untreated for 8 wk and subsequently randomly divided into one group that was continued without treatment and another group that was treated with enalapril (48 mg/kg body wt per d administered in the drinking fluid for 4 wk). Renal morphology was evaluated after 8 or 12 wk, respectively, by stereologic techniques after pressure-controlled perfusion fixation. In SNX rats at 8 and particularly at 12 wk, the glomerulosclerosis index was significantly higher than in sham-operated rats. At 12 wk, it was lower in rats that had been treated for 4 wk with enalapril compared with untreated SNX rats, suggesting partial reversal of glomerular lesions. This was associated with a decrease in mean glomerular volume and mean glomerular tuft volume, a reduced number of capillaries per glomerulus, and reduced total length of capillaries per glomerulus but without any significant change in the length of individual capillaries. The numerical capillary density (Euler number density) as an index of topologic complexity did not change. The total capillary surface area per glomerulus was strikingly increased after subtotal nephrectomy and partially reversed after enalapril. This was accounted for primarily by fewer capillaries without any change in diameter. In parallel, the number of endothelial cells per glomerulus was strikingly increased after subtotal nephrectomy and decreased with enalapril treatment, but endothelial cell volume remained elevated. The study shows harmonious coordinate remodeling of the entire glomerulus during regression of glomerular lesions after subtotal nephrectomy. Proportionate reduction of glomerular volume and capillary number without change of individual capillary length were found. The numerical capillary density of the tuft therefore remained unchanged.",

The general and most practical approach is avoidance and cautious use of these drugs in asthmatics. However, these classes of medications can exert a major role in the management of common and serious diseases. Fortunately, controller therapy for asthma and alternative or more selective medications for the treatment of these conditions are now available.", 
    "256": "The benefits of treating hypertension in terms of reduction of morbidity and mortality are well established. However, it is debatable whether this benefit is derived entirely from the effects of a reduced blood pressure or whether these agents exert effects over and above blood pressure reduction on the endothelium. Hypertension is associated with adverse changes (whether damage or dysfunction) in the endothelium. Indeed, endothelial damage/dysfunction has have been demonstrated to be a reliable prognostic indicator of future cardiovascular events in hypertension. Of the various drug classes, calcium channel blockers and the ACE inhibitors have significant direct effects on the endothelium. This is in contrast to the beta blockers and alpha adrenergic blockers that appear to indirectly influence endothelial function solely as a result of lowered blood pressure. Antioxidants may have a beneficial effect on endothelial function as well, although their clinical use does not seem to translate into clinical benefit.", 
    "257": "Angiotensin-I converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) are commonly used as safe antihypertensive agents, and it has recently been suggested that they decrease the risk of cancer development. Recent studies have revealed that the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is involved in the development of many types of tumor. Angiotensin-II (AT-II) has many biological effects, including neo-vascularization, which plays a pivotal role in tumor development. AT-II induces a potent angiogenic factor, namely the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Some studies have proven that several ACE-Is are potent inhibitors of experimental tumor development and angiogenesis at clinically comparable doses. VEGF expression in tumors is also significantly suppressed by ACE-Is. When used in combination with the conventional anti-cancer drugs, ACE-Is exert more potent anti-tumor activities as compared with either single agent, in addition to suppression of the intra-tumoral angiogenesis. Furthermore, ACE-Is reportedly not only suppress tumor growth but also attenuate the carcinogenesis process in which angiogenesis is involved. Since ACE-Is are already in widespread clinical case without any serious adverse effects, they may represent a potential new strategy for cancer therapy and chemoprevention.", 
    "258": "We studied the effects of spontaneous high blood pressure and the captopril treatment on the subfornical organ (SFO) of rats. The brains of control Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY), WKY rats treated with captopril (WKY-T), spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and SHR rats treated with captopril (SHR-T) were processed immunohistochemically using anti-angiotensin II as primary antibody. Immunorective material (IRM) for angiotensin II was observed in a group of neurons and some cells of the ependymal layer of the SFO in WKY rats. The angiotensin II immunoreactive (AGII-ir) in the SHR rats was decreased, showing positive reaction only in a few neurons, while captopril treatment induced an increase in immunoreactive material in hypertensive rats, but contrarily, the expression of AGII-ir in the WKY-T group was scarce. The variations of the angiotensin II observed in the SFO could be owing to an interaction between the hypertension and its captopril treatment.", 
    "259": "In a group of elderly patients over 65 years of age with at least two cardiovascular diagnoses requiring chronic medication (n=424), drug therapy at hospital discharge and at home thereafter was followed for a 1-year period. Two home visits took place at 3 months and 12 months after initial discharge. A median of six prescriptions had already been given at the time of discharge; this number increased slightly during ambulatory follow-up. After 1 year, about 30% of the patients had to take more than ten dosing units per day. After discharge, about 50% of all prescriptions were subject to changes in the choice of the preparation (brand-generic) or the agent used [within a class of similar agents, e.g. angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACIs)]. The prescription of some problematic agents (benzodiazepines, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents) increased during the ambulatory follow-up, but pivotal medications for cardiovascular indications (e.g., ACI) given at discharge were maintained. Over-the-counter (OTC) drugs-which were not part of the discharge medication-contributed to 12% of all drugs taken at V4. The majority of the prescriptions (95% of about 2,000 prescriptions surveyed at each visit) was in agreement with the drug's approval status and was appropriate in terms of absence of contraindications. At home visits, therapy with ACI or beta-blocking agents was in agreement with clinical guidelines, although under-dosing was obvious. Blood pressure control (<140/90 mmHg) was achieved in 61% of the patients at discharge and deteriorated to 45% after 1 year; international normalized ratio control in patients with oral anticoagulation also declined (control rate 57% at discharge, 46% after 1 year). Statins as secondary prevention were given at discharge in only 60% of suitable patients, declining to about 50% in ambulatory visits. Diabetic control was not present in 35% of the patients at discharge or at home. Properties of or reason for their medication could be given for the majority (70-80%) of the prescriptions; these quotations were, however, cursory and almost nothing was known about medication risks. At home visits, non-compliance was admitted for approximately 8% of the prescriptions. In conclusion, for pivotal indications, family doctors widely followed the discharge recommendations, but deficits in ambulatory prescriptions and poor performance of the medication were in part already employed at the time of discharge from the hospital. The lack of a patient's knowledge about their own medication is precarious.",

We employed rats with myocardial infarction (MI) to examine effects of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, imidapril, on SR Ca(2+) transport, protein content, and gene expression. Imidapril (1 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)) was given for 4 wk starting 3 wk after coronary artery occlusion. Infarcted rats exhibited a fourfold increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, whereas rates of pressure development and decay were decreased by 60 and 55%, respectively. SR Ca(2+) uptake and Ca(2+) pump ATPase, as well as Ca(2+) release and ryanodine receptor binding activities, were depressed in the failing hearts; protein content and mRNA levels for Ca(2+) pump ATPase, phospholamban, and ryanodine receptor were also decreased by approximately 55-65%. Imidapril treatment of infarcted animals improved cardiac performance and attenuated alterations in SR Ca(2+) pump and Ca(2+) release activities. Changes in protein content and mRNA levels for SR Ca(2+) pump ATPase, phospholamban, and ryanodine receptor were also prevented by imidapril treatment. Beneficial effects of imidapril on cardiac function and SR Ca(2+) transport were not only seen at different intervals of MI but were also simulated by another angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril, and an ANG II receptor antagonist, losartan. These results suggest that blockade of the renin-angiotensin system may increase the abundance of mRNA for SR proteins and, thus, may prevent the depression in SR Ca(2+) transport and improve cardiac function in congestive heart failure due to MI.",

CHF subjects (n=64) were randomized to receive placebo, 10 mg of ramipril alone, 50 mg of sildenafil alone or a combination of ramipril and sildenafil in a double-blind manner. FMD (flow-mediated dilation) of the brachial artery was determined by high-resolution ultrasound imaging before and at 1, 2 and 4 h after administration of the study drug.

Of these, 371 were considered 'healthy' since they were not affected by cardiovascular diseases or diabetes, whereas 2610 tested positive for cardiovascular diseases and were considered 'diseased'. The sex-specific 95th percentiles for SCr (cut-off points) were calculated in the healthy reference sample to define the upper limit for normal SCr values. The distribution and prevalence of diseased subjects having values over the cut-off point values were then estimated. Associations between values over the cut-off point levels and pathological or clinical conditions were analysed from the diseased sample. The longitudinal phase was carried out on 1906 subjects who had SCr values and sufficient clinical information for our investigation.

In diseased subjects, the prevalence of SCr values over the cut-off point was 4.6% in men and 9.3% in women. In logistic regression analysis, independent variables that correlated with over the cut-off point SCr values were: age >75 years [odds ratio (OR) = 2.2; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.5-3.4], atherosclerosis of the lower limbs (OR = 2.0; 95% CI = 1.2-3.3), cerebrovascular disease (OR = 1.9; 95% CI = 1.2-3.3), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor medication (OR = 1.8; 95% CI = 1.2-2.8), fibrinogen values >3.5 g/l (OR = 1.2; 95% CI = 1.2-2.7) and diuretic treatment (OR = 1.6; 95% CI = 1.1-2.4).

The mice received four intraperitoneal injections of MPTP at 1-h intervals. Administration of perindopril showed dose-dependent neuroprotective effects against striatal dopamine and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA) depletion 3 days after MPTP treatment. Our immunohistochemical study showed that MPTP can severe damage in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-immunoreactive neurons after MPTP treatment. The administration of perindopril significantly attenuated MPTP-induced substantia nigra and striatal damage. The present study also showed that the immunoreactivity of parvalbumin (PV)- or neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS)-positive cells in the substantia nigra was decreased 7 days after MPTP treatment, whereas no significant changes were observed in these cells of the striatum throughout the experiments. The administration of perindopril significantly attenuated MPTP-induced decrease of the PV- or nNOS-immunoreactivity in the nigral cells. In double-labeled immunostaining with anti-PV and anti-nNOS antibody, PV-immunoreactive cell bodies and fibers were not double-labeled for nNOS-immunoreactive cell bodies and fibers in both the striatum and substantia nigra after MPTP treatment. Furthermore, PV- or nNOS-immunoreactive cell bodies and fibers in both the striatum and substantia nigra were not double-labeled for TH-immunoreactive cell bodies and fibers. These results demonstrate that the ACE inhibitor perindopril has a dose-dependent protective effect against MPTP-induced striatal dopamine, DOPAC and HVA depletion in mice. The present study also demonstrates that perindopril is effective against MPTP-induced degeneration of the nigral neurons and interneurons. Furthermore, our immunohistochemical study suggests that PV-immunoreactive cells and nNOS-immunoreactive cells are different interneurons in both the striatum and substantia nigra. Thus, our results provide further evidence that the ACE inhibitor perindopril may offer a novel therapeutic strategy for Parkinson's disease (PD).",

The use of spironolactone was limited by adverse sexual effects, including gynaecomastia. Eplerenone is a newer aldosterone antagonist that is much more selective, with minimal affinity for progesterone and androgenic receptors; therefore, there are very few reports of adverse sexual effects. A review of published trials shows that eplerenone reduces blood pressure (BP) in a dose-dependent manner, from 50 to 200 mg/day, and to a similar degree as enalapril. It has an additive effect when given to patients inadequately controlled on an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin-receptor blocker. Eplerenone performs better than losartan in African-American patients and lowers BP regardless of initial plasma renin activity. The risk of hyperkalaemia is low, similar to that of enalapril, and < 1% of patients have had to be withdrawn from studies because of elevated serum potassium levels. Eplerenone is an effective, well-tolerated antihypertensive agent that may be used alone or in conjunction with other agents; apart from the risk of hyperkalaemia, adverse effects are similar to placebo.",

Because of the important role the kidneys play in maintaining homeostasis, chronic kidney disease can affect almost every body system. Early recognition and intervention are essential to slowing disease progression, maintaining quality of life, and improving outcomes. Family physicians have the opportunity to screen at-risk patients, identify affected patients, and ameliorate the impact of chronic kidney disease by initiating early therapy and monitoring disease progression. Aggressive blood pressure control, with a goal of 130/80 mm Hg or less, is recommended in patients with chronic kidney disease. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-II receptor antagonists are most effective because of their unique ability to decrease proteinuria. Hyperglycemia should be treated; the goal is an AIC concentration below 7 percent. In patients with dyslipidemia, statin therapy is appropriate to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Anemia should be treated, with a target hemoglobin concentration of 11 to 12 g per dL (110 to 120 g per L). Hyperparathyroid disease requires dietary phosphate restrictions, antacid use, and vitamin D supplementation; if medical therapy fails, referral for surgery is necessary.

In both cases, bilateral enlarged kidneys and severe hypertension were detected without oligohydramnion and respiratory distress. The mother of case 1 has polycystic kidneys. The father of case 2 was diagnosed as ADPKD. Case 2 had heart failure due to hypertension. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) was administered to both patients and resulted in good control of blood pressure. ADPKD in the neonatal and very early infantile period has diverse clinical courses. In general, although severe cases are rare, some cases have renal failure and/or hypertension as we reported. We emphasize that both the prompt diagnosis of ADPKD and the start of medication are of great importance in the neonatal and very early infantile period. We recommend that neonates and infants with a family history of ADPKD undergo screening including physical examinations, blood pressure measurements and urinalysis.", 
    "299": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors elicit outside-in signaling via ACE in endothelial cells. This involves the CK2-mediated phosphorylation of ACE on Ser1270 and the activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/c-Jun pathway, resulting in an enhanced endothelial ACE expression. Because cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression is reported to be increased in subjects treated with ACE inhibitors, we determined the role of ACE signaling in this phenomenon and the transcription factors involved. In lungs from mice treated with the ACE inhibitor ramipril for 5 days, COX-2 expression was increased. A similar (1.5- to 2-fold) increase in COX-2 protein was detected in primary cultures of human endothelial cells treated with ramiprilat. In an endothelial cell line stably expressing human somatic ACE, ramiprilat increased COX-2 promoter activity, an effect not observed in ACE-deficient cells or cells expressing a nonphosphorylatable ACE mutant (S1270A). The ramiprilat-induced, ACE-dependent increase in COX-2 expression and promoter activity (both 1.5- to 2-fold greater than control) was prevented by the inhibition of JNK. Ramiprilat significantly enhanced the DNA binding activity of activator protein-1 in cells expressing ACE but not S1270A ACE. Activator protein-1 decoy oligonucleotides prevented the ACE inhibitor-induced increase in COX-2 promoter activity and protein expression. As a consequence of the ramiprilat-induced increase in COX-2 expression, prostacyclin and prostaglandin E2, but not thromboxane A2, production was increased and was inhibited by the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib. These results indicate that ACE signaling may underlie the increase in COX-2 and prostacyclin levels in patients treated with ACE inhibitors.",

To evaluate amino terminal-pro-BNP (NT-proBNP) and CRP, separately and together, for assessment of risk of CHF, we performed a nested case-control study of the 6105 participants of the Perindopril pROtection aGainst REcurrent Stroke Study (PROGRESS), a placebo-controlled study of a perindopril-based blood pressure-lowering regimen among individuals with previous stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). Each of 258 subjects who developed CHF resulting in death, hospitalization, or withdrawal of randomized therapy during a mean follow-up of 3.9 years was matched to 1 to 3 control subjects. NT-proBNP and CRP predicted CHF; the odds ratio for subjects in the highest compared with the lowest quarter was 4.5 (95% confidence interval, 2.7 to 7.5) for NT-proBNP and 2.9 (confidence interval, 1.9 to 4.7) for CRP, and each remained a predictor of CHF after adjustment for all other predictors. Screening for both markers provided better prognostic information than screening for either alone. Elevation of NT-proBNP above 50 pmol/L and CRP above 0.84 mg/L predicted CHF with sensitivity of 64% and specificity of 66%. NT-proBNP and CRP predicted CHF in subjects receiving perindopril-based therapy. We conclude that NT-proBNP and CRP are independent predictors of CHF risk after stroke or TIA. Moreover, NT-proBNP and CRP may be markers of mechanisms of CHF pathogenesis distinct from those responsive to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-based therapy.",

We recorded demographic data, drugs used, relevant medical history, laboratory data and clinical/pharmacological risk factors, i.e. reduced renal function, reduced liver function, heart failure, diabetes, compliance problems, drugs with a narrow therapeutic index and drug allergy. DRPs were documented after reviewing medical records and participation in multidisciplinary team discussions. An independent quality assessment team retrospectively assessed the DRPs in a randomly selected number of the study population.",

    "317": "Atherosclerosis is a pathological process caused by vascular remodeling. It symbolizes one of the major causes for morbidity and mortality in the western world. The causes for these vascular problems are manifold and different etiologies have been discussed. Since the 1980s the role of chronic inflammation has been considered and is now confirmed by many studies and experimental data. Several inflammatory pathways have been shown to participate in the atherosclerotic process. Different markers for inflammation have been found to predict the future risk for developing cardiovascular disease. Among these, high sensitivity C-reactive protein has been the most extensively validated. Newer markers such as CD40 ligand appear also to provide important information regarding risk stratification. Medications have been found to lower levels of inflammatory markers and perhaps decrease the associated clinical risk. Statins particularly appear to have anti-inflammatory mediated benefits, though other classes of drugs are also being evaluated. Lipid-lowering therapy in general has been found to be associated with reductions in inflammatory markers. Antithrombotic therapy, such as intravenous glycoprotein lIb/IIIa inhibitors and clopidogrel, has also been demonstrated to reduce inflammatory marker release. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonists are being evaluated for possible roles in targeting arterial inflammation. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may also have anti-inflammatory properties. In this article we review the existing data in the inflammatory model of atherosclerosis. Furthermore, we discuss the prognostic value of different inflammatory markers and the potential benefit of anti-inflammatory therapies in cardiovascular disease.", 
    "318": "1. Pregnancy in rats is characterized by a reduction in arterial pressure that is associated with a decreased response to vasoconstrictors. However, the responses to vasodilators in isolated vessels remain controversial and are not well established in hypertensive pregnant rats. 2. In the present study, we investigated the effect of pregnancy on the bradykinin (BK)-induced vasodilator responses of the isolated mesenteric arterial bed (MAB) from Wistar normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and determined the role of nitric oxide (NO), endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in these responses. 3. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) in pregnant normotensive and pregnant hypertensive rats (93 +/- 1 and 122 +/- 2 mmHg, respectively) was lower than in non-pregnant controls (128 +/- 1 and 163 +/- 2 mmHg, respectively; P < 0.05). In MAB isolated from normotensive rats and precontracted with phenylephrine, the effects of bradykinin, acetylcholine (ACh) and nitroglycerine (NG) were not influenced by pregnancy. In contrast, the vasodilator responses to BK were significantly reduced in pregnant compared with non-pregnant SHR and seemed to be specific to BK. 4. The ACE inhibitor captopril potentiated BK vasodilator responses and abolished the differences between pregnant and non-pregnant SHR. Inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) synthase by N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME) significantly reduced the vasodilator effect of BK in all groups. In the presence of l-NAME plus high K+ solution (47 mmol/L), BK-induced vasodilation was completely blocked. The NO-dependent component of the responses seems to be more important in hypertensive rats and pregnancy does not modify this profile. 5. Our results suggest that increased ACE activity may be involved in the pregnancy associated reduction in vasodilator responses to BK in the MAB of hypertensive rats. Pregnancy does not modify the relative contribution of the EDHF and NO to the vasodilator effect of BK.", 
    "319": "Strict blood pressure control is pivotal in the management of patients with aortic dissection (AD), but is frequently difficult to achieve. We determined antihypertensive medical therapy and levels of blood pressure (BP) control in 40 patients with chronic AD. Patient charts were reviewed for clinical variables, serial BP measurements, and antihypertensive drug therapy. Patients were divided into two groups: patients in group 1 had effective BP control (<135/80 mmHg), patients in group 2 had resistant hypertension (BP>/=135/80 mmHg despite prescription of at least three antihypertensive drugs). Overall, systolic BP (SBP) was 130+/-20 mmHg, and diastolic BP (DBP) was 72+/-13 mmHg. Patients received a median of 4 (1-6) antihypertensive drugs. beta-blockers were used in 38/40 (95%) patients. Effective BP control was achieved in 24/40 (60%) patients (group 1), while 16/40 (40%) patients had resistant hypertension (group 2) despite receiving significantly more antihypertensive drugs (5 [4-6] vs 4 [1-5], P=0.001). Mean SBP was 116+/-9 (101-132) mmHg in group 1 and 151+/-13 (137-181) mmHg in group 2 (P<0.001); there was no difference in DBP. Group 2 patients had a significantly higher body mass index and were younger than patients in group 1. In conclusion, in the majority of patients with chronic AD, effective BP control can be achieved, but usually requires the combination of multiple antihypertensive drugs. However, in a significant proportion of patients (40%), who appear to be younger and more obese, medical therapy fails to achieve effective BP control despite use of a multiple drug regimen.", 
    "320": "Enhanced coughing can be produced in a variety of animal models, including the guinea pig, cat, dog and pig. Typically, airway inflammation has been produced by sensitization, exposure to cigarette smoke, sulphur dioxide or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. In some of these models, inflammatory mediators such as bradykinin and tachykinins have been shown to contribute to the enhanced coughing. While most of these studies have focussed on peripheral mechanisms, increases in central excitability of the cough reflex have been shown to occur as a result of airway inflammation. As such, we propose that enhanced coughing in pathological conditions is the result of plastic changes in both peripheral and central neural elements. Furthermore, we present a modified model of the neurogenesis of cough that takes into account peripheral and central plasticity induced by mediators of inflammation.",

    "325": "One main issue in protein-protein docking is to filter or score the putative docked structures. Unlike many popular scoring functions that are based on geometric and energetic complementarity, we present a set of scoring functions that are based on the consideration of local balance and tightness of binding of the docked structures. These scoring functions include the force and moment acting on one component (ligand) imposed by the other (receptor) and the second order spatial derivatives of protein-protein interaction potential. The scoring functions were applied to the docked structures of 19 test targets including enzyme/inhibitor, antibody/antigen and other classes of protein complexes. The results indicate that these scoring functions are also discriminative for the near-native conformation. For some cases, such as antibody/antigen, they show more discriminative efficiency than some other scoring functions, such as desolvation free energy (deltaG(des)) based on pairwise atom-atom contact energy (ACE). The correlation analyses between present scoring functions and the energetic functions also show that there is no clear correlation between them; therefore, the present scoring functions are not essentially the same as energy functions.",

In addition, crystal structures of well-known proteases were presented. The key focus however, was on designing inhibitors of proteolytic enzymes and their use in controlling disease processes mediated by proteases. Inhibitors described ranged from naturally occurring novel peptides such as Ascaris pepsin inhibitor, to trials with finely tuned peptidomimetics inhibiting human peptidases (interleukin converting enzyme; ICE and angiotensin converting enzyme; ACE) and rhinovirus 3C protease (antirhinovirus therapeutics; Pfizer Inc).

All treatments significantly decreased blood pressure and cardiac indices, expressed as the ventricles to body weight ratio, both variables being significantly correlated. Total ventricular collagen content was similarly decreased in all treated groups. Zof significantly increased the expression of collagen type III and normalized the collagen type I/III ratio.

Microalbuminuria (in diabetics) and proteinuria are early markers for potentially serious renal disease, and are associated with increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Proteinuria also contributes to renal scarring, and accelerates the progression of chronic kidney disease to end-stage renal failure. Screening of diabetics for microalbuminuria, and the initial workup of proteinuria, should occur in the primary care setting. Reduction of microalbuminuria in diabetics may retard its progression to overt diabetic nephropathy. Therapy of renal diseases should aim for optimal blood pressure control and the maximum possible reduction in urinary protein excretion. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) and/or angiotensin-receptor blocker (ARB) therapy is the most effective measure to achieve this.

In the control group, the O(2) deficit and MRT values measured during the first exercise test were 491 +/- 217 mL and 42 +/- 16 seconds and 515 +/- 159 mL and 41 +/- 13 seconds in the second exercise test. The differences in O(2) deficit and MRT in the study group were considered to be statistically significant (P = 0.008 and P = 0.004, respectively). Based on our findings, there was a significant improvement in O(2) kinetic values with an acute reduction in blood pressure in hypertensive patients, most likely as a result of an improved response in cardiac output.", 
    "354": "A rapid, sensitive, and highly selective liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method was developed and validated for simultaneous determination of enalapril and its major active metabolite enalaprilat in human plasma. The analytes were extracted from plasma samples by liquid-liquid extraction, separated on a Zorbax Extend-C(18) column, and detected by tandem mass spectrometry with a Turbo IonSpray ionization interface. The method has a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 0.1 ng/ml for both enalapril and enalaprilat. The chromatographic run time was approximately 3.5 min. The standard calibration curves for both enalapril and enalaprilat were linear in the concentration ranges of 0.10-100.0 ng/ml in human plasma. The intra- and inter-run precisions, expressed as the relative standard deviation (R.S.D.), were less than 7.7 and 7.8%, determined from QC samples for enalapril and enalaprilat, and accuracy was within +/-3.9 and +/-2.7% in terms of relative error, respectively.

This template exhibits unique difficulties such as limited solubility in non-polar and most polar porogens with multiple functionality evident in its 4 pKa values. Selectivity for this template was achieved using a 3-monomer sol-gel system utilising solid phase extraction (SPE). Analysis of the template and its related substances was achieved using HPLC. The effect of solvent polarity on the rebinding of the template was studied. Through optimisation of porogen and extraction solvent, the imprinted material (MIP) demonstrated enhanced selectivity, for the template, over a non-imprinted material (NIP). Selectivity was also illustrated for the original template over two of its related substances. The effect of starting monomer ratio on selectivity was studied to determine the interactions, which could best be exploited to further enhance selectivity.",

All patients underwent a twenty-four-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring device (spacelabs 90207). The nocturnal fall of blood pressure (BP) was calculated from (daytime mean BP-night-time mean BP)/daytime BP, while 'daytime' values were recorded between 6 h and 22 h and 'night-time' values between 22 h and 6 h. Non-dippers were defined as those whose nocturnal decrease in mean systolic BP and/or mean diastolic BP was < 10% of the daytime BP. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the correlation between circadian blood pressure profile and factors as gender, age, height, body mass index (BMI), family history of premature cardiovascular disease, women under age 65 or men under age 55, smoking habits, grade of hypertension, and strategy of antihypertensive drugs.",

It demonstrates antihypertensive activity and slows the progression of chronic heart failure (CHF). Recently it has been evaluated in comparison with an ACE inhibitor regimen in patients with heart failure or left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) after an acute myocardial infarction (MI), a population known to be at high risk of subsequent death or other major cardiovascular events. In the VALIANT (VALsartan In Acute myocardial iNfarcTion) trial, valsartan was as effective as captopril at reducing mortality and cardiovascular morbidity in patients who developed heart failure and/or LVSD after surviving an MI. It was also generally well tolerated in this population. Treatment with a combination of valsartan plus captopril provided no additional therapeutic benefit over treatment with captopril and was less well tolerated. Valsartan has a potential role as a new treatment for high-risk patients in the post-MI setting.", 
    "387": "Chronic heart failure (CHF) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in western society. It is now widely accepted that the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and, in particular, angiotensin II (A-II) play a key role in the pathophysiology of CHF. Large-scale clinical trials have demonstrated that inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), the principal enzyme responsible for A-II production, improve symptoms and survival in patients with CHF. This enzyme is also responsible for the breakdown of the vasodilator hormone bradykinin. Administration of ACE inhibitors is associated with increased plasma bradykinin levels and this is thought to contribute to the vascular changes associated with ACE inhibitor therapy. However, RAAS inhibition with ACE inhibitors remains incomplete because ACE inhibitors do not block the non-ACE-mediated conversion of angiotensin I to A-II. Angiotensin receptor antagonists (angiotensin receptor blockers; ARBs) antagonize the action of A-II at the A-II type 1 (AT(1)) receptor, whilst allowing the potentially beneficial actions of A-II mediated via the A-II type 2 (AT(2)) receptor. Evidence that the clinical benefit demonstrated with ACE inhibitors in patients with CHF may extend to ARBs has only emerged recently. Combination therapy with both an ACE inhibitor and an ARB has a number of potential advantages and has been investigated in several large-scale clinical trials recently. In patients with CHF, first-line therapy should include an ACE inhibitor and a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist. The addition of an ARB provides symptomatic relief but has not been shown to improve survival. Where an ACE inhibitor is not tolerated, treatment with an ARB would seem an appropriate alternative. There is insufficient data to support the routine use of ARBs as first-line therapy in the management of CHF.",

ADRB2 G16 allele frequency was found to be 41.0% and. 47.4% in Huoqiu and Yuexi, respectively. In Yuexi family-based association test (FBAT) revealed that the G16 allele was associated with a greater DBP decrease in response to a 15-day benazepril treatment (Z = 2.12, P = 0.03), and the data were consistent with a dominant inheritance model.

Patients (age 18-74 years) with mild to moderate essential hypertension were enrolled in this multinational, open-label, centrally randomized, prospective parallel group study. Previous antihypertensive treatment, with either an ACE inhibitor, a beta-blocker, a Ca2+ channel blocker or a diuretic, was maintained for a run-in period of 4 weeks and was then substituted at the baseline visit where patients were randomized into two groups to receive either candesartan cilexetil 8 mg (n = 985) or 16 mg (n = 982) once daily for an 8-week treatment period. Blood pressure (BP) reduction was the primary endpoint after 4 weeks of therapy and the secondary endpoint after 8 weeks of therapy. Results of the first 4 weeks of therapy are presented here. A total of 1,967 patients were included: 985 received candesartan cilexetil 8 mg and 982 candesartan cilexetil 16 mg once daily; 1,879 patients were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. The percentages of patients receiving an ACE inhibitor, a beta-blocker, a Ca2+ channel blocker or a diuretic as previous antihypertensive treatment were 44.7, 18.8, 30.6 and 5.9%, respectively. After 4 weeks of treatment with candesartan cilexetil 8 and 16 mg, sitting diastolic and systolic BP were reduced (mean +/- SD): -7 +/- 10 and -14 +/- 17 mmHg, and -8 +/- 10 and -16 +/- 16 mmHg, respectively. The percentage of patients who were still borderline hypertensive or hypertensive after 4 weeks of substitute treatment was lower in the candesartan cilexetil 16 mg group than in the 8 mg group: 7.1 and 5.3%, respectively, versus 9 and 7.4%, respectively.

There is also recent evidence that standard antitussive agents, such as codeine, may not reduce cough during upper respiratory infections. Therefore, there is a need for more effective and better-tolerated agents. The efficacy of levocloperastine, a novel antitussive, which acts both centrally on the cough center and on peripheral receptors in the tracheobronchial tree in treating chronic cough, was compared with that of other standard antitussive agents (codeine, levodropropizine and DL-cloperastine) in six open clinical trials. The studies enrolled patients of all ages with cough associated with various respiratory disorders including bronchitis, asthma, pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Levocloperastine significantly improved cough symptoms (intensity and frequency of cough) in all trials, and improvements were observed after the first day of treatment. In children, levocloperastine reduced nighttime awakenings and irritability, and in adults it was effective in treating cough induced by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. When compared with other antitussive agents, levocloperastine had improved or comparable efficacy, with a more rapid onset of action. Importantly, no evidence of central adverse events was recorded with levocloperastine, whereas drowsiness was reported by a significant number of patients receiving codeine. Levocloperastine is an effective antitussive agent for the treatment of cough in patients of all ages. It has a more rapid onset of action than standard agents with an improved tolerability profile.",

    "404": "Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have a pharmacological role in the treatment of heart failure through their blockade of the effects of angiotensin II. ARBs, however, lack the potential benefits of inhibiting the breakdown of bradykinin that is seen with ACE-Is. Historically, the medical literature assessing ARBs in the treatment of chronic heart failure have been short in duration and primarily focused on surrogate markers of disease severity. Recent, well-designed clinical trials have shed new light on the potential roles of ARBs in the treatment of chronic heart failure and their effects on mortality in this patient population. In comparison to captopril, losartan has been shown to have similar benefits in cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. In patients with systolic dysfunction who are intolerant to ACE-Is, candesartan has been shown to reduce cardiovascular mortality and hospital admissions for heart failure. In combination with ACE-Is, candesartan and valsartan have been shown to improve heart failure morbidity and, with candesartan, reduced cardiovascular mortality in those with systolic dysfunction. These 2 trials show conflicting mortality information regarding the use of triple therapy with ACE-Is, ARBs, and beta-blockers for systolic dysfunction. In patients with heart failure but preserved systolic dysfunction, candesartan showed no effects on mortality and only modest effects on morbidity.",

Levosimendan at low dose (12 microg/kg), high dose (24 microg/kg), or placebo were administered in thirty-one patients in a randomized and four-times masked controlled study. Heart rate was not significantly different between experimental groups. Significant increases in cardiac output and left ventricular ejection fraction occurred after high-dose (P < 0.001; P = 0.006) and low-dose levosimendan (P = 0.001; P = 0.002). Both doses of levosimendan produced significant increased stroke volume and decreased systemic vascular resistance. Mean arterial pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and left ventricular end-systolic volume were not significantly different between groups. The low-dose levosimendan produced better hemodynamic response than high-dose and may be preferable in patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting.",

SHR and WKY at 15 weeks of age were treated with quinapril (10 mg/kg per day) for 10 weeks. Structural changes in the mesenteric arteries were measured by optical sectioning with confocal microscopy and in renal arteries by light microscopic measurements. Apoptotic cells in the mesenteric vessel wall were identified using the terminal deoxynucleotide transferase-mediated dUTP-nick end-labelling (TUNEL) method. The response of mesenteric arteries to noradrenaline, electrical stimulation, acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside was studied using a pressure myograph system. Treatment with quinapril significantly lowered systolic blood pressure and ventricular weight in both SHR and WKY. It reduced wall thickness and medial volume in mesenteric arteries from SHR and WKY and media-to-lumen ratio in interlobular arteries of SHR. It also decreased the number of smooth muscle layers in SHR and increased the number of apoptotic smooth muscle cells in both SHR and WKY. In addition, treatment normalized the augmented contractile responses and improved the impaired relaxation response of SHR mesenteric arteries to the level of WKY. We conclude that treatment with quinapril lowered blood pressure and improved cardiac and vessel structure and vessel function.

This present study analyses self-reported data on current drug usage of men and women with coronary heart disease. The data were collected as a part of a wider drug utilisation survey which in turn is a module of the German National Health Interview and Examination Survey 1998 (Bundes-Gesundheitssurvey 1998). This survey was compiled by conducting a standardised computer-assisted medical interview with a representative sample of the German population between the ages of 18 and 79 years. Of the 7099 participants, 209 of the women and 252 of the men affirmed having had a medically diagnosed coronary heart disease (CHD) such as angina pectoris and/ or myocardial infarction. Slightly more men (87.3%) were using drugs to treat CHDs than the women (86.1%). They (the men) also used more drugs on average (men 3.3, women 3.0). These differences however were not statistically significant. Clear and statistically significant differences were present in the usage of salicylic acid (men 54.4%, women 45.6%), HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (men 26%, women 15.3%) and cardiac glycosides (men 14%, women 25.8%). The higher usage prevalence rate of salicylic acid found in the men still remained after taking their age, social status and the region (east vs west) into account. The differences in the usage of specific drugs in the treatment of CHDs in men and women indicate a difference in prescription behaviour in the ambulatory medical care. Whether and to which extent gender-specific differences still remain today has to be decided by using current epidemiological data representative of the population.", 
    "409": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) is the first human homologue of ACE to be described. ACE2 is a type I integral membrane protein which functions as a carboxypeptidase, cleaving a single hydrophobic/basic residue from the C-terminus of its substrates. ACE2 efficiently hydrolyses the potent vasoconstrictor angiotensin II to angiotensin (1-7). It is a consequence of this action that ACE2 participates in the renin-angiotensin system. However, ACE2 also hydrolyses dynorphin A (1-13), apelin-13 and des-Arg(9) bradykinin. The role of ACE2 in these peptide systems has yet to be revealed. A physiological role for ACE2 has been implicated in hypertension, cardiac function, heart function and diabetes, and as a receptor of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. This paper reviews the biochemistry of ACE2 and discusses key findings such as the elucidation of crystal structures for ACE2 and testicular ACE and the development of ACE2 inhibitors that have now provided a basis for future research on this enzyme.", 
    "410": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is a zinc- and chloride-dependent metallopeptidase that plays a vital role in the metabolism of biologically active peptides. Until recently, much of the inhibitor design and mechanism of action of this ubiquitous enzyme was based on the structures of carboxypeptidase A and thermolysin. When compared to the recently solved structures of the testis isoform of ACE (tACE) and its Drosophila homologue (AnCE), carboxypeptidase A showed little structural homology outside of the active site, while thermolysin revealed significant but less marked overall similarity. The ellipsoid-shaped structure of tACE, which has a preponderance of alpha-helices, is characterised by a core channel that has a constriction approximately 10 A from its opening where the zinc-binding active site is located. Comparison of the native protein with the inhibitor-bound form (lisinopril-tACE) does not reveal any striking differences in the conformation of the inhibitor binding site, disfavouring an open and closed configuration. However, the inhibitor complex does provide insights into the network of hydrogen-bonding and ionic interactions in the active site as well as the mechanism of ACE substrate hydrolysis. The three-dimensional structure of ACE now paves the way for the rational design of a new generation of domain-selective ACE inhibitors.", 
    "411": "Angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (ACEI) each act in a different manner to prevent myocardial fibrosis and left ventricular (LV) stiffness in animals with pathways in the heart for generating ANG II as well as ACE. A model of pacing-induced congestive heart failure (CHF) was used to test the central hypothesis that ARB + ACEI prevents myocardial fibrosis and decreases LV stiffness to a greater extent than ARB or ACEI alone. Thirty-five dogs were assigned to the following treatment protocols on the 8th day of a 4-wk pacing schedule: 1) rapid ventricular pacing, 2) ARB (candesartan cilexetil, 1.5 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)) with pacing, 3) ACEI (enalapril, 1.9 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)) with pacing, 4) ARB (candesartan cilexetil, 0.75 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)) + ACEI (enalapril, 0.95 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)) with pacing, and 5) sham operation. The LV stiffness coefficient was significantly increased after rapid pacing but was significantly lower with ARB + ACEI than with ARB or ACEI alone. The collagen volume fraction and mRNA levels of collagen I and III, which were increased by rapid pacing, were significantly lower with ARB + ACEI than with ARB or ACEI alone. Thus ARB + ACEI prevents myocardial fibrosis and decreases LV stiffness during the progression of CHF compared with ARB or ACEI alone.",

The results confirmed that an irradiated drug can trap several main radicals. Moreover, the radical composition varied as a function of the treatment. In addition, non-volatile final products were studied by liquid chromatography coupled to UV and to mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The variation of the radical composition did not influence the profile of the final products; this appears to indicate that, in the case of captopril, the trapped radicals observed by EPR are not the main precursors of the final products. Finally, high-performance liquid chromatography data appear to indicate that radiosterilization of captopril is feasible.",

Clinical studies have shown that M100240 is capable of decreasing ACE activity and angiotensin II concentrations while increasing plasma renin activity and potentiating the effects of atrial natriuretic peptide. This may result in a unique treatment benefit in disease states characterized by intravascular volume or sodium overload or increased venous pressure. The pharmacokinetics of MDL 100,173 were evaluated in 30 healthy subjects in an open-label, randomized, 2-period crossover design. Subjects received a single oral dose of 50 mg of M100240 administered with a high-fat meal and separately under fasted conditions. Serial plasma concentrations of M100240 and MDL 100,173 were analyzed, and pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated with noncompartmental methods. The intrasubject percent coefficient of variation for MDL 100,173 C(max) and AUC(0-24h) were less than 20%, indicating that this agent is a moderately variable drug. Although AUC(0-24h) was within the protocol-defined range of 80% to 125%, the lower limit of the 90% confidence interval for C(max) fell outside of the 70% to 143% range. Absence of a food effect on the pharmacokinetic profile of 50 mg of M100240 could therefore not be demonstrated. This finding is not surprising based on the documented food effect with the sulfhydryl-containing ACE inhibitor, captopril. Clinical significance of this pharmacokinetic food effect is unlikely, as the magnitude of pharmacodynamic response is probably better correlated with AUC than a single-point determination of C(max). Single oral doses of 50 mg of M100240 were safe and well tolerated under fed and fasted conditions.",

The cardiovascular mortality of diabetics in comparison with nondiabetics is four to six times higher. Through an intensification of diagnostics and therapy, it is possible to reduce the hospital mortality of diabetics with acute myocardial infarction. For each patient with myocardial infarction and for whom diabetes has not been previously diagnosed, it is recommended that the blood sugar be tested upon admission to the hospital and that an oral glucose tolerance test be conducted for the detection of a glucose metabolic disorder during the postinfarction phase. An example of a successful approach for metabolic intervention is glucose-insulin infusion to optimize the metabolic condition during the acute phase.",

Even minimal disturbances in glucose tolerance are associated with a chronic, generalized inflammatory reaction that links components of the metabolic syndrome and contributes to the development of diabetic complications as well as to the development and progression of arteriosclerosis. The most important mediators and markers of this inflammation cascade are NF-kappaB, TNF-alpha, IL-6, CRP and PAI-1. For the treatment of subclinical inflammation, substances with anti-inflammatory properties such as statins or ACE inhibitors are of increasing importance.",

In controlled studies on persons with IGT, every second diabetes case could be prevented through lifestyle modifications beginning in childhood. Three-year studies showed that the incidence of diabetes could be reduced by about one-third with the medications acarbose, metformin and orlistat.

APH may lead to serious neurologic, cardiovascular, or surgical-site complications and often requires intervention and management. Postoperative hypertension lasts less than six hours in most patients. Reversible or treatable causes of hypertension, including pain, anxiety, hypothermia, and hypoxemia, should be considered and treated before the implementation of antihypertensive therapy. The ideal agent for treating APH is intravenously administered, is fast acting, and has a short duration of action, allowing the rapid and safe adjustment of therapy to achieve a targeted BP range. Sodium nitroprusside has long been considered the standard therapy and has many of the ideal characteristics. However, because of the need for invasive hemodynamic monitoring and concerns about toxicity in patients given sodium nitroprusside, several newer agents may be preferable in routine clinical practice. Labetalol, nicardipine, and nitroglycerin have been widely studied or used. Hydralazine, esmolol, fenoldopam, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, and clonidine may also be useful treatment options.",

The use of the above ACEIs promoted the normalization of proliferative processes in the epithelium of the gastric mucosa (GM) in patients with AH and concomitant chronic gastritis. This effect ofACEIs is not related to an antihypertensive effect since the antihypertensive agent amlodipine fails to exert such an effect on GM. The revealed fact of the positive effect ofACEIs not only on the morphological characteristics of GM, but also on the severity of the dyspeptic syndrome is important from the clinical point of view.",

Twenty-eight patients aged 52-68 years who had Functional Class (FC) III-IV HF that had developed due to coronary heart disease were examined. All the patients were divided into 2 groups (with 14 patients in each group) and they received routine therapy including an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and a beta-adrenoblocker. Group 1 patients were given the ACEI fosinopril in a dose of 10-20 mg/day, Group 2 patients took captopril in a dose of 50-75 mg/day. The course of therapy was 12 weeks. All the patients underwent echocardiography by the routine procedure. The plasma levels of angiotensin-II, aldosterone, and brain natriuretic peptide (BNUP) were determined by radioimmunoassay. The plasma contents of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and C-reactive protein (C-RP) were verified by enzyme immunoassay. An analysis of the findings indicated that during therapy the FC of HF decreased on the average by 10.9% in Group 1 and by 11. 7% in Group 2 (p = 0.14). With this, fosinopril was superior to captopril not only in its capacity of improving overall left ventricular contractile function, but it was characterized by a more pronounced effect on regression of the plasma pool of C-RP and TNF-alpha. The marked depressive action of the ACEI fosinopril on the plasma pool of products of the renin-angiotensin system, BNUP, and proinflammatory cytokines may be considered to be as a basis for preferably prescribing the agent to patients with severe HF.",

One hundred five patients were prescribed diuretics, 49 angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, 23 b blockers, and 47 digoxin. There were no significant differences between readmitted and non-readmitted patients with regard to the use of the specific classes of cardiac medications. None of the specific classes of cardiac medications predicted the number of days between the initial hospital discharge and readmission 3 months later. The use of a small, non-probability sample and exclusion of variables limit the results of the study.

As a consequence of these RCTs, we now know that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta blockers should be concomitantly administered to patients who tolerate these therapies with the expectation that reductions in cardiovascular deaths and hospital admissions for management of heart failure will be accomplished. New therapeutic modalities must now be proven to add incremental clinical benefits to these establish therapies. This challenge is currently being addressed with aldosterone blocking agents as well as angiotensin receptor blockers. This article discusses the major RCTs in this field and places the new trials in perspective.",

The authors suggest that drugs that have been prescribed in previous decades as the post-AMI \"standard-of-care,\" such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers, and statins, may also play an important role in the disappearance of Dressler syndrome due to their immunomodulatory effects.", 
    "458": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a recently discovered homologue of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) that is thought to counterbalance ACE. ACE2 cleaves angiotensin I and angiotensin II into the inactive angiotensin 1-9, and the vasodilator and anti-proliferative angiotensin 1-7, respectively. ACE2 is known to be present in human kidney, but no data on renal disease are available to date. Renal biopsies from 58 patients with diverse primary and secondary renal diseases were studied (hypertensive nephropathy n = 5, IgA glomerulopathy n = 8, minimal change nephropathy n = 7, diabetic nephropathy n = 8, focal glomerulosclerosis n = 5, vasculitis n = 7, and membranous glomerulopathy n = 18) in addition to 17 renal transplants and 18 samples from normal renal tissue. Immunohistochemical staining for ACE2 was scored semi-quantitatively. In control kidneys, ACE2 was present in tubular and glomerular epithelium and in vascular smooth muscle cells and the endothelium of interlobular arteries. In all primary and secondary renal diseases, and renal transplants, neo-expression of ACE2 was found in glomerular and peritubular capillary endothelium. There were no differences between the various renal disorders, or between acute and chronic rejection and control transplants. ACE inhibitor treatment did not alter ACE2 expression. In primary and secondary renal disease, and in transplanted kidneys, neo-expression of ACE2 occurs in glomerular and peritubular capillary endothelium. Further studies should elucidate the possible protective mechanisms involved in the de novo expression of ACE2 in renal disease.", 
    "459": "Several large clinical trials have demonstrated that successful control of blood pressure decreases the incidence of strokes. Also, drugs that stimulate the production of angiotensin II, such as diuretics, calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), provide additional stroke reduction than drugs that suppress angiotensin II production such as beta-blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Since the stroke-protective effect of angiotensin II is mediated through stimulation of the AT2 receptors, drugs that selectively block the AT1, such as the ARBs, provide greater stroke protection than the other antihypertensive drugs. The blockade of the AT1 receptors lessens local brain ischemia, whereas the stimulation of the AT2 receptors increases local blood flow through recruitment of collateral vessels. Among the ARBs, losartan possesses certain unique properties not shared by other members of its class, which enhance its stroke-protective effects. These include the prevention of platelet adhesiveness and aggregation and the decrease of serum uric acid levels, which both lead to reduction in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. (",

    "464": "Albuminuria is recognized in all hypertension guideline statements as a cardiovascular risk factor and indicator of kidney disease. Recent data also demonstrate a strong association between the presence of microalbuminuria and elevations in C-reactive protein. Thus, the increased membrane permeability that generates microalbuminuria may be secondary to an inflammatory process. Progression from microalbuminuria (>30 and < or =300 mg albumin/g creatinine) to macroalbuminuria (>300 mg albumin/g creatinine) indicates a worsening of vascular disease and the presence of kidney disease. Recent outcome trials of kidney disease progression have demonstrated the best results among those with reductions in albuminuria in concert with blood pressure (BP) reduction. Thus, use antihypertensive agents that not only lower BP but also lower or normalize albuminuria levels. All recent guideline statements support the use of agents that block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system as part of a regimen to achieve the BP goal. Further lowering of albuminuria may be achieved by adding either a nondihydropyridine calcium antagonist such as verapamil or diltiazem, or aldosterone receptor blockers. Use of an angiotensin receptor blocker added to an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or vice versa can further lower albuminuria by an additional 30%-40%, which is not true of the additional lowering of BP.", 
    "465": "Microalbuminuria is a major independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in persons with diabetes or hypertension, the general population, and persons with known CVD. Although microalbuminuria is a stronger risk factor in men, women with increased albuminuria levels are also at a higher risk of CVD. Microalbuminuria is an indicator of generalized endothelial injury, a hallmark of systemic atherosclerosis. Treatments that decrease albuminuria, particularly agents that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system, reduce CVD risk in various populations, including those with and without diabetes or hypertension. Whether albuminuria should be a treatment target for CVD is not yet proven. Nevertheless, the measurement of albuminuria is clinically useful to identify high-risk individuals who should receive intensive risk factor management based on current treatment guidelines.",

Several large outcome risk trials and comprehensive meta-analyses have found that CCBs reduce the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality associated with uncontrolled hypertension, including stroke. CCBs, however, appear less effective than angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and diuretics for preventing heart failure and myocardial infarction. CCBs are among the agents listed as potential first-line therapy, either alone or in combination with other agents in hypertension management guidelines. Furthermore, CCBs are suitable for add-on therapy in combination with diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin-II receptor blockers. CCBs may be partially suitable for patients with comorbid Raynaud's syndrome, isolated systolic hypertension (dihydropyridine), or angina pectoris (non-dihydropyridine). The newer inherently long-acting dihydropyridine agents (e.g., lacidipine, lercanidipine), which are not currently available in the United States, appear to have comparable efficacy to older agents of the dihydropyridine class but may have an improved tolerability profile, especially with regard to peripheral edema.",

Hydrolyzing sodium caseinate for 1 and 2 h inhibited ACE activity, as measured by an in vitro ACE inhibition test. The hydrolysates with the highest ACE inhibitory potential were fractionated by gel permeation chromatography and their low molecular weight fractions collected. These fractions were subsequently subfractionated by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. Several hydrophobic subfractions showed high ACE inhibitory potential, and their peptide composition was determined using an ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with an elctrospray ionization source. Analysis of the low molecular weight fraction identified 14 peptides with known antihypertensive activity and 1 with previously described opioid activity. On the basis of the peptide composition of active subfractions, two potentially active novel sequences were defined, and the following synthetic peptides were synthesized: FVAPFPEVFG (alphaS1 39-48), ENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (alphaS1 33-48), NENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (alphaS1 32-48), LNENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (alphaS1 31-48), NLHLPLPLL (beta 147-155), ENLHLPLPLL (beta 146-155), and VENLHLPLPLL (beta 145-155).

    "520": "A retrospective study covered 220 recipients with CRF. The patients were divided into the study group (n = 103) and the control group (n = 117). The study group was given ACE inhibitor enalapril the efficacy of which was assessed by arterial pressure (systolic, diastolic, mean) dynamics, 24 h proteinuria and the rate of CTN progression. This rate was suggested by probability of plasm creatinin doubling (Kaplan-Meier technique).", 
    "521": "Enalapril significantly inhibited CTN progression running with minimal or marked proteinuria, had a pronounced hypotensive effect, promoted stabilization of minimal proteinuria (in CTN with minimal proteinuria) or reduction of protein excretion (in a proteinuric variant of CTN).",

MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 250 CGN patients treated in 1993-2001 participated in the trial. They had different morphological variants of CGN. AH was diagnosed in 193 patients. In the course of the trial changes in antihypertensive treatment policy were observed.", 
    "524": "AH was most prevalent in mesangiocapillary (96.6%) and diffuse fibroplastic nephritis (83.9%). In functional insufficiency of the kidneys AH occurred in 90.1%. AH was associated with clinical and morphological signs of nephritis activity, severity of tubulointerstitial alterations, purin and lipid metabolism. Uric acid level and age were independent prognostic factors of AH development. AH correction was achieved in the initial and subsequent periods in 51.7 and 58.7% cases. Later, ACE inhibitors were prescribed more often, both in monotherapy and in combination with other drugs; calcium antagonists were taken less frequently.", 
    "525": "AH in CGN patients is a frequent finding and depends on a morphological nephritis variant, activity of the renal process and degree of renal failure. Age, gender and metabolic disorders are also involved in AH development in CGN patients. Recently, there is a trend to more frequent prescription of combined treatment. Drugs of choice in the treatment of renal AH are ACE inhibitors.", 
    "526": "Angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are effective in reducing the risk of heart failure, myocardial infarction, and death from cardiovascular causes in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction or heart failure. ACE inhibitors have also been shown to reduce atherosclerotic complications in patients who have vascular disease without heart failure.", 
    "527": "In the Prevention of Events with Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibition (PEACE) Trial, we tested the hypothesis that patients with stable coronary artery disease and normal or slightly reduced left ventricular function derive therapeutic benefit from the addition of ACE inhibitors to modern conventional therapy. The trial was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in which 8290 patients were randomly assigned to receive either trandolapril at a target dose of 4 mg per day (4158 patients) or matching placebo (4132 patients).", 
    "528": "The mean (+/-SD) age of the patients was 64+/-8 years, the mean blood pressure 133+/-17/78+/-10 mm Hg, and the mean left ventricular ejection fraction 58+/-9 percent. The patients received intensive treatment, with 72 percent having previously undergone coronary revascularization and 70 percent receiving lipid-lowering drugs. The incidence of the primary end point--death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction, or coronary revascularization--was 21.9 percent in the trandolapril group, as compared with 22.5 percent in the placebo group (hazard ratio in the trandolapril group, 0.96; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.88 to 1.06; P=0.43) over a median follow-up period of 4.8 years.", 
    "529": "In patients with stable coronary heart disease and preserved left ventricular function who are receiving \"current standard\" therapy and in whom the rate of cardiovascular events is lower than in previous trials of ACE inhibitors in patients with vascular disease, there is no evidence that the addition of an ACE inhibitor provides further benefit in terms of death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction, or coronary revascularization.", 
    "530": "Among the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family members, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) promotes cell proliferation or differentiation, whereas c-jun N terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK are thought to inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis. The MAPK family may plays some role during kidney development, when large-scale proliferation and apoptosis have been observed to occur. Also, in this period, the renin-angiotensin system is markedly activated. We have demonstrated that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition in the developing rat kidney increases apoptosis and decreases cell proliferation, which may account for renal growth impairment. The aim of this study, therefore, was to examine the relationship between the MAPK family and renin-angiotensin system during neonatal renal development. Newborn rat pups were treated with enalapril (30 mg . kg(-1) . d(-1)) or normal saline for 7 d. Right kidneys of both groups were selected for immunohistochemical stains of MAPKs and activating transcription factor-2 (ATF-2), and left kidneys were selected for reverse transcriptase-PCR and immunoblot analysis of MAPKs, phospho-MAPKs, and ATF-2. To determine whether apoptosis is involved in the same tubules that highly expressed JNK and p38, we performed terminal deoxynucleotide transferase-mediated nick-end labeling stain for apoptotic cells and immunohistochemical stains for JNK-2, p38, and ATF-2 expression in the serial sections from the same kidney of the enalapril-treated group. In the enalapril-treated group, JNK-2, p38, phospho-JNK-2, phospho-p38, and ATF-2 protein expressions were significantly increased, and their immunoactivities were strongly detected in the proximal tubular epithelial cells in the cortex, compared with the control group. Especially JNK-2 and p38 expressions were highly activated and were spatially in accordance with the occurrence of apoptosis. ERK1/2 and phospho-ERK expressions were not changed by enalapril. These results suggest that the expressions of the MAPK family are modulated by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition in the developing kidney. JNK and p38 may be implicated to participate in angiotensin II-related intracellular signaling pathways of renal apoptosis in the developing kidney.", 
    "531": "The Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) study has provided evidence for the use of ramipril for secondary cardiac prevention for patients with peripheral arterial disease. Despite this many vascular surgeons and general practitioners are reluctant to prescribe ACE inhibitors in a group of patients perceived to have a high incidence of renal artery stenosis. This review aims to review the pathophysiology of the renin-angiotensin system and make evidence based recommendations for commencing ACE inhibitors as part of a comprehensive delivery of best medical therapy to patients with peripheral arterial disease.",

After the initial 8 weeks, nonresponders (DBP > or =85 mm Hg) received an additional 8 weeks of treatment with a fixed combination of delapril + manidipine or enalapril + HCTZ; patients whose DBP was normalized continued their initial monotherapy through the end of the study. The primary efficacy variable was the change in sitting DBP at the end of treatment. Secondary efficacy variables were the percentage of patients whose DBP was normalized (DBP Z:85 mm Hg) and the percentage of responders (> or =10-mm Hg reduction in DBP or DBP <85 mm Hg).", 
    "535": "One hundred sixty patients (84 men, 76 women) were randomized to receive delapril (n = 106) or enalapril (n = 54). After 16 weeks of treatment, the mean (SD) reduction in DBP was similar with the 2 treatments (delapril, -14 [8] mm Hg; enalapril, -15 [8] mm Hg). In the delapril and enalapril groups, DBP was normalized in a respective 55 (51.9%) and 29 (53.7%) patients, and 77 (72.6%) and 38 (70.4%) were responders; there was no significant difference between groups. Tolerability was also similar in both groups--10 (9.4%) patients in the delapril group and 5 (9.3%) in the enalapril group experienced adverse events that were judged related to treatment.",

    "537": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors significantly improve survival in patients with atherosclerosis. Although ACE inhibitors reduce local angiotensin II (AngII) formation, serine proteases form AngII to an enormous amount independently from ACE. Therefore, our study concentrates on the effect of the ACE-inhibitor ramiprilat on chemokine release, AngII receptor (ATR) expression, and NF-kappaB activity in monocytes stimulated with AngII.", 
    "538": "AngII-induced upregulation of IL-8 and MCP-1 protein and RNA in monocytes was inhibited by the AT1R-blocker losartan, but not by the AT2R-blocker PD 123.319. Ramiprilat dose-dependently suppressed AngII-induced upregulation of IL-8 and MCP-1. The suppressive effect of ramiprilat on AngII-induced chemokine production and release was in part caused by downregulation of NF-kappaB, but more by a selective and highly significant reduced expression of AT1 receptors as shown in monocytes and endothelial cells.", 
    "539": "In our study we demonstrated for the first time that ramiprilat reduced expression of AT1R in monocytes and endothelial cells. In addition, ramiprilat downregulated NF-kappaB activity and thereby reduced the AngII-induced release of IL-8 and MCP-1 in monocytes. This antiinflammatory effect, at least in part, may contribute to the clinical benefit of the ACE inhibitor in the treatment of coronary artery disease.",

She had physical features of the Marfan syndrome. Transthoracic echocardiography showed an ascending aortic aneurysm, severe aortic regurgitation, and mildly dilated left ventricle. Because of marked aortic aneurysm and severe aortic regurgitation, the patient was treated with a beta-blocker and an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. Surgery was refused by her parents. We describe here a child with Marfan syndrome in whom significant dilatation of the ascending aorta and severe aortic regurgitation is encountered and major cardiovascular complications of Marfan syndrome were reviewed.", 
    "541": "The number of people with diabetes grows worldwide. The complications resulting from this disease are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. World Health Organization estimates that, while in the year 2000 the number of people with diabetes was about 177 million, by 2025, this will increase to at least 300 million. The diabetes epidemic, without primary prevention, will continue to grow. Individuals with type 2 diabetes are at a significantly higher risk for coronary heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, and stroke, and they have a greater probability of having hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity. A number of clinical trials provide evidences that RAAS inhibition could be helpful at preventing new onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Pharmacologic treatment that antagonize the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) provide more benefits, not only in patients after myocardial infarction and in congestive heart failure, but also in persons with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus.", 
    "542": "Advanced cirrhosis is characterized by arterial vasodilatation and the reduced arterial response to vasoconstrictors. Both of these are related to an increase of endothelial (prostacyclin and nitric oxide) and nonendothelial vasodilatators (glucagon) level. Experimental study had shown that the responsiveness to vasoconstrictors of the mesentery artery may be normalized by the inhibition of glucagon or nitric oxide. The aim of our study was to assess the effects on renal hemodynamics by the administration of octreotide, the synthetic somatostatin analog, an inhibitor of the release of endogenous vasodilatators.",

    "545": "Octreotide in a short infusion treatment induces an inhibitory effect on renin aldosterone secretion which may be responsible for the benefical effects on sodium excretion. The significant increase of MAP may be the result of an inhibition of vasodilatatory substances or an increased arterial responsiveness to vasoconstrictors. The significant effect on renal function in patients with advanced cirrhosis can be a promising therapeutic perspective in the treatment of hepatorenal syndrome.",

Differences in baseline clinical characteristics between the 2 groups were not significant. The BB doses given in group 1 P was lower but the difference was significant for bisoprolol only. Intolerance to BB imposing withdrawal occurred in 12% of group 1 P and in 10% group 2 P (p>0.05). Symptomatic improvement expressed as a significant decreases in NYHA class was observed in both groups.

    "548": "Thirty years ago, aldosterone was an unidimensional hormone considered responsible for salt and water homeostasis. The current role of aldosterone in pathology is very complex. Recognition of mineralocorticoid receptors throughout the body has raised the importance of aldosterone in understanding the pathophysiology of previously unknown cardiovascular effects. This came from the first documentation of aldosterone receptors outside the kidney, making it not only an endocrine hormone, but a paracrine one, too. Aldosterone is contemporary appreciated to play an important role as a cardiac and vascular risk hormone. Aldosterone-mediated actions include the expression of several genes: collagen genes; genes controlling tissue growth factors and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1; genes mediating inflammation. Aldosterone receptor blocking agents improve cardiovascular structure, function, and prognosis. They appear to provide additive benefit when used in conjunction with either an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker.",

The treatment we currently use does not directly influence specific underlying pathomechanisms of this disorder, and several attempts are being made in order to introduce more specific therapies. We summarized the most important pharmacological strategies that are being evaluated for the treatment of dilated cardiomyopathy and pointed out the novel therapeutic approaches concerning heart failure secondary to this clinical condition.",

This study was carried out to determine angiotensin-converting enzyme levels and angiotensin-converting enzyme gene polymorphism in Turkish hypertensive patients, and to establish whether there is an association of angiotensin-converting enzyme gene polymorphism with clinical and echocardiographic parameters. We have investigated the association among the allelic distribution of the insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the angiotensin-converting enzyme gene identified by polymerase chain reaction, angiotensin-converting enzyme activity determined spectrophotometrically, cardiac morphology and function assessed by means of echocardiography. Distribution of angiotensin-converting enzyme gene I/D polymorphism and allele frequencies in hypertensive patients was not significantly different from controls. D allele frequency was 51.7% in hypertensives vs. 51.9% in controls and I allele 48.3 vs. 48.1%, respectively. The level of angiotensin-converting enzyme activity was significantly higher in the patients homozygotes for D allele (DD = 59.93 U/l) than in heterozygotes (ID = 39.49) and in homozygotes for I allele (II = 40.28 U/l). In addition to these, the level of angiotensin-converting enzyme activity was significantly lower in the ID and especially II patients receiving ACE inhibitors than the others.

The purpose of this article is to provide the HF practitioner with practical information about how to make these distinctions and how to develop a treatment plan for the HF patient that incorporates important information about OLD. The pathophysiology of OLD and HF is reviewed first, followed by details on the assessment of dyspnea and the management of acute exacerbations of OLD. Finally, pharmacologic issues in the management of concomitant HF and OLD are reviewed.", 
    "558": "Left-ventricular systolic dysfunction, or heart failure (HF), is a chronic, progressive condition with a poor prognosis. Approximately 50% of deaths, especially in mild to moderate cases, are sudden. Most sudden deaths are thought to be due to ventricular tachycardia; however, premature ventricular contractions and couplets parallel severity of HF and have been associated with increased mortality risk as opposed to dysrhythmic death. Ventricular arrhythmogenesis results from many mechanisms (afterdepolarizations, reentry, and enhanced automaticity) and preconditions (electrophysiologic abnormalities, neuroendocrine activation, electrolyte imbalances, scar from an ischemic event in ischemic cardiomyopathy, fibrosis in dilated cardiomyopathy, hemodynamic abnormalities, and HF medical management). Nurses are key caregivers in optimally managing HF, either by direct actions or by using advocacy, communication, and collaboration skills to promote positive outcomes. Ventricular dysrhythmia management consists of facilitating core HF pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic medical therapies, using amiodarone to improve symptoms, as needed, and utilizing implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy to reduce the risk of sudden cardiac death.",

Statistical analysis for BNP and ANP was done by Students t-test. The patient group was randomly subdivided into two subgroups of 34 patients, each treated with either an ARB, irbesartan, or an ACE inhibitor (ACE-I), captopril. BNP and ANP were measured in both subsamples and correlated with clinical, functional and neurohormonal parameters throughout a follow-up period of six months and at the sixth month.",

The mean BNP (pmol/L) in patients was 44.78+/-54.36 and in the controls was 7.12+/-8.28 (p=0.000) and the mean ANP (pmol/L) was 30.32+/-25.97 in patients and 11.18+/-7.92 in controls (p=0.000). A statistically significant difference was found between patients and healthy controls. Significant correlations were found between natriuretic peptides and EF. Between the baseline phase and the sixth month, BNP and ANP decreased significantly in the ARB group. At the sixth month, both BNP and ANP were lower in the ARB group. Evidence of clinical benefit was found with both ARB or ACE-I treatment throughout the six months, with patients moving from classes III and IV to class II NYHA. Improvement of EF was also found, with transition of patients with lower EF (even <30%) to higher values. EF was higher in the ARB group at the sixth month.",

    "584": "Cross-talk between various cardiovascular risk factors has been suggested by a number of studies. This study examines the interaction between hypercholesterolaemia and the renin-angiotensin system in vivo in man.", 
    "585": "We performed a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover study on 40 hypercholesterolaemic patients, comparing cholesterol-lowering therapy with a statin for six months versus placebo. Brachial artery function was assessed by bilateral venous occlusion plethysmography using intra-arterial infusions of the endothelial-dependent vasoconstrictors, angiotensin I (Ang I) and angiotensin II (Ang II), to measure vascular angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and Ang II receptor response respectively. The endothelial-independent vasoconstrictor, noradrenaline, was used as a control vasoconstrictor. Results were analysed by multiple analysis of variance and statistical significance was taken as a p value <0.05.", 
    "586": "Cholesterol-lowering treatment with a statin significantly reduced the mean total cholesterol level to 5.71 mmol/L vs. 7.57 mmol/L on placebo (p<0.0001). Hypercholesterolaemia significantly increased the vasoconstriction response to noradrenaline (placebo versus statin treatment; p=0.046). In hypercholesterolaemia, there was a strong trend towards a reduction in the vasoconstriction response to Ang I (placebo versus statin treatment; p=0.089). In hypercholesterolaemia, the vasoconstriction response to Ang II was significantly reduced (placebo versus statin treatment; p=0.01).", 
    "587": "Our in vivo results show that, unlike some other previous work, hypercholesterolaemia is associated with down-regulation of the vasoconstrictor response to Ang II and that statin therapy up-regulates the local vasoconstrictor response to Ang II. The possibility now arises that, in man, statins alter the balance between AT(1)-receptors and AT(2)-receptors.", 
    "588": "Arterial stiffness has recently been recognised as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in hypertension. Many of the complications seen with angiotensin II (Ang II) excess or hyperaldosteronism--an increased event rate, left ventricular hypertrophy, endothelial dysfunction and target organ damage--are also associated with arterial stiffness. It is possible that reduced arterial compliance may be one mechanism whereby increased activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) produces adverse vascular effects. Common pathophysiological processes, altered collagen turnover and increased fibrosis may underlie both arterial stiffness and RAAS-associated vascular damage. While it is recognised that patients with hyperaldosteronism have increased arterial stiffness, the role of the RAAS in modulating arterial compliance in essential hypertension and in normotensive subjects is less clear cut. There is, however, more consistent data which show that drugs that interfere with Ang II or aldosterone, namely angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and aldosterone antagonists, all reduce arterial stiffness. In many cases, this is to a greater extent than predicted from the extent of reduction in blood pressure (BP), suggesting a role for RAAS in vascular stiffness in hypertensive subjects. There is also evidence that combined ACE inhibitors (ACE-Is) and ARBs may have an additive effect in reducing stiffness. The reduction in cardiovascular mortality in end-stage renal disease patients treated with ACE-Is was preferentially seen in those who had reduced arterial stiffness. These data suggest that, in addition to regulation of vascular biology and BP, the RAAS is an important determinant of arterial stiffness in health and, more particularly, in disease.", 
    "589": "Activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is increased in patients with heart failure, and its maladaptive mechanisms may lead to adverse effects such as cardiac remodelling and sympathetic activation. Elevated renin activity has been demonstrated in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. (Third- generation synthetic non-peptide renin inhibitors, with more favourable properties than earlier renin inhibitors, lower ambulatory blood pressure and may have a role to play in other cardiovascular disease.) Chymase, a protease inhibitor stored in mast cells that generates angiotensin II (Ang II) (in addition to angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE]), has been linked to extracellular matrix remodelling in heart failure. Again, chymase inhibitors have been developed to investigate its functions in vitro and in vivo . Bradykinin is thought to contribute to the cardioprotective effect of ACE inhibition through modification of nitric oxide release, calcium handling and collagen accumulation. Ang II is believed to influence a number of molecular and structural changes in the heart, mostly mediated through the AT1-receptor. The importance of the RAAS in heart failure is shown by the survival benefit conferred by treatment with ACE inhibitors.", 
    "590": "Activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is increased in heart failure. Agents which act on the RAAS can be expected to benefit these patients. Recent trials which have furthered our understanding of drugs which are of benefit in heart failure--angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, beta-blockers and aldosterone antagonists--are discussed. It is desirable to use multiple agents for best results in patients with heart failure. New European Society of Cardiology guidelines on the management of heart failure are expected later this year.", 
    "591": "Significant progress has been made in the last few years in the management of heart failure. In particular, several trials have given significant results. It has become apparent that heart failure may be prevented in some patients by treatment of risk factors such as coronary artery disease. Experience with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors has shown that the survival and symptomatic benefits do last in the long term, and confirm that they are the first-line treatment in heart failure. The results of a number of trials using the angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) candesartan, valsartan and losartan are presented and discussed. There is also some experience now in the use of candesartan for patients with heart failure and preserved left ventricular systolic function. The COMET trial compared the beta-blockers carvedilol and metoprolol tartrate, and suggests that there may be differences in clinical effect between beta-blockers. The selective aldosterone receptor blocker eplerenone was evaluated in the EPHESUS trial in post-MI patients with signs of heart failure. Based on these clinical trials, heart failure guidelines are now being updated.", 
    "592": "Aldosterone plays a key role in the pathophysiology of heart failure. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers may not suppress aldosterone production in the long term. This allows aldosterone to exert its effects on myocardial fibrosis and cardiac remodelling, endothelial function, electrolytes and baroreceptor response. The Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES) tested spironolactone against placebo in patients with severe heart failure. The study found a 30% reduction in the risk of death among patients treated with spironolactone and a 31% reduction in the risk of death from cardiac causes. Patients in the spironolactone group had significantly lower risks of death from progression of heart failure and sudden cardiac death. The Eplerenone Post-Acute Myocardial Infarction Heart Failure Efficacy and Survival Study (EPHESUS) investigated the effects of eplerenone against placebo in patients with myocardial infarction complicated by left ventricular dysfunction. Compared to placebo, the relative risk of death from any cause was 0.85 in eplerenone-treated patients, and the relative risk of death or hospitalisation for cardiovascular events was 0.87. The reduction in the risk of sudden death from cardiac causes was statistically significant. In conclusion, aldosterone blockade should form part of optimal therapy for patients with heart failure.", 
    "593": "Survival in patients with heart failure remains very poor, and is worse than that for most common cancers, including bowel cancer in men and breast cancer in women. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is not completely blocked by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. Blockade of the RAAS at the AT1-receptor has the theoretical benefit of more effective blockade of the actions of angiotensin II. ACE inhibitors (ACE-Is) prevent the breakdown of bradykinin: this has been blamed for some of the unwanted effects of ACE-Is although bradykinin may have advantageous effects in heart failure. Consequently, ACE-Is and ARBs might be complementary or even additive treatments; recent trials have tested these hypotheses. The Candesartan in Heart failure Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and morbidity (CHARM) programme compared the angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) candesartan (target dose 32 mg once daily) to placebo in three distinct but complementary populations of patients with symptomatic heart failure. These were: patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) who were ACE-I-intolerant (CHARM-Alternative); patients with reduced LVEF who were being treated with ACE-Is (CHARM-Added); and patients with preserved left ventricular systolic function (CHARM-Preserved). There were substantial and statistically significant reductions in the primary composite end point (risk of cardiovascular death or hospital admission for heart failure) in CHARM-Alternative. This was also the case in CHARM-Added, supporting and extending the findings of Val-HeFT. In CHARM-Preserved, the effect of candesartan on the primary end point did not reach conventional statistical significance though hospital admission for heart failure was reduced significantly with candesartan. In the CHARM-Overall programme there was a statistically borderline reduction in all-cause mortality with a clear reduction in cardiovascular mortality. All-cause mortality was reduced by 12% in the two CHARM trials in patients with low LVEF. CHARM succeeded in answering a number of questions about the safety and efficacy of ARB use in heart failure. It showed evidence for a clinical benefit of candesartan both additive to and independent of ACE-I use. The benefits in terms of clinical outcomes were seen irrespective of beta-blocker usage. Benefits in patients with preserved LVEF were shown in the proportion of patients hospitalised with worsening heart failure and in overall number of admissions for heart failure. Candesartan had expected effects on blood pressure and renal function, emphasising the need for careful patient monitoring.", 
    "594": "The implementation of guidelines for medical therapy of heart failure may be problematic for the following reasons: 1. Elderly patients and women were underrepresented in large clinical trials which may limit their therapeutic impact in these patients. 2. Therapeutic decisions are influenced by co-morbidities like renal failure, obstructive airway disease (COLD, Asthma), stroke, and diabetes mellitus. We therefore discuss the differential therapy of heart failure in view of particular patient subgroups.", 
    "595": "The present study is a snapshot of how diabetic patients are treated for diabetes and coexisting cardiovascular risk factors in Turkey. We also addressed the question of what percentage of these patients are treated appropriately according to the current guidelines. Next step will be to determine which pharmacological treatment strategies affect mortality and morbidity in these patients and whether there are regional differences in these outcomes.", 
    "596": "To get a representative picture, Turkey was splitted into four parts with different ethnic and socioeconomic features then centers were randomized within each of these parts. Number of the centers in a region were calculated according to the population of that region. 305 physicians in 11 cities participated in data collection during a period of 3 months. Consecutive 2226 diabetic patients patients who were above 55 years of age were included. Detailed information was obtained about the demographic features and the cardiovascular risk factor and diabetes status of the patients together with relevant drug treatment. Laboratory analyses were done locally and recorded if performed during the last 3 months.", 
    "597": "Most patients were treated with oral antidiabetic monotherapy regardless of diabetes duration, metabolic control and complication and cardiovascular risk factor status. There was a trend among physicians except for endocrinologists to underprescribe insulin. Monotherapy also was the main mode of treatment for hypertension. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors were generally not used as first line treatment contrary to the recommendations and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers are not prescribed for renoprotection in microalbuminuric patients. Statins, fibrates, metformin and aspirin were largely underused.", 
    "598": "The present study indicates that diabetic patients are undertreated in Turkey. Therefore every effort should be spent to implement current guidelines in diabetic patients in order to prevent macro and microvascular complications of diabetes.", 
    "599": "Some potassium channel openers (KCOs) are potent vasodilators that mainly target the ATP-sensitive potassium channels in vascular smooth muscle cells. Their lack of tissue selectivity limits their clinical use in hypertension therapy. Iptakalim [2,3-dimethyl-n-(1-methylethyl)-2-butylamine], which belongs to a novel chemical type of KCO, possesses unique pharmacological characteristics. In vitro experiments have shown that iptakalim could limit its vasorelaxing actions to resistance vessels. In this study, we investigate the antihypertensive effects of iptakalim on two different experimental hypertensive models: stroke-prone, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRsps) and two-kidney with one-clip renal hypertensive dogs (2K1C RHD). In acute hypotensive tests, iptakalim showed stable, long-lasting antihypertensive effects in SHRsps and 2K1C RHDs. Mean-while, it had little effect on heart rate when compared with pinacidil, nifedipine, captopril, or bisoprolol. In experimental therapeutic tests, repeated doses in SHRsps for 30 days or in 2K1C RHDs for 14 days produced consistent antihypertensive effects without causing tolerance. In separate experiments, chronic administration of iptakalim resulted in reversing hypertensive vascular remodeling in spontaneously hypertensive rats and hypertensive cardiac remodeling in SHRsps. These results suggest that iptakalim is a promising antihypertensive drug.",

Myocytes were isolated from subendocardial, midmyocardial, and subepicardial regions of the noninfarcted left ventricular wall. Action potentials and calcium current were recorded using whole-cell patch clamp technique.", 
    "602": "The action potential duration of repolarization 90 % (APD90) was more prolonged in midmyocardium rather than in subepicardium and subendocardium with healed myocardial infarction. The transmural dispersion of repolarization (TDR) was increased in the three ventricular regions. The amplitude of I(Ca-L) [was enhanced but its density was decreased in noninfarcted ventricular myocytes due to increased cell membrane capacitance. The increased differences of calcium currents among subepicardium, midmyocardium, and subendocardium were also discovered. Normalization of heterogeneous changes in repolarization after treatment with imidapril was observed and decrease of TDR in noninfarcted area was measured. Early after depolarization (EAD) events of noninfarcted midmyocardium were markedly decreased by imidapril.", 
    "603": "Imidapril reduced the electrophysiologic heterogeneities in noninfarcted area in rabbits after myocardial infarction. This ability of imidapril may contribute to its antiarrhythmic efficacy.", 
    "604": "Peculiarly shaped chromatograms of some compounds that consist of two reversible isomers have been reported. Those of a compound that consists of three reversible isomers are described here. Because disulfide of captopril has two cis-trans convertible bonds, it exists in three forms of cis-cis, cis-trans and trans-trans isomers. The disulfide has produced various HPLC-UV profiles under various conditions, such as three split peaks, three peaks with bridging plateaus and one broad peak. The effect of the column temperature and the eluent flow rate on the profile was investigated and explained by interconversion among three isomers. A profile analysis could provide some kinetic constants of this reaction.", 
    "605": "Nitric oxide (NO) is an important bioactive signaling molecule that mediates a variety of normal physiological functions, which, if altered, could contribute to the genesis of many pathological conditions, including diabetes. In this study, we examined the possible diabetogenicity of NO by noting differences in the cellular binding of insulin in dogs treated with the NO donor, S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) compared to captopril-treated controls. GSNO administration resulted in an abnormality in glucose metabolism which was attributed to decreased binding of insulin to its receptor on the cell membrane of mononuclear leucocytes, 11.60 +/- 0.60% in GSNO-treated dogs compared with 18.10 +/- 1.90% in captopril-treated control (p < 0.05). The decreased insulin binding was attributed to decreased insulin receptor sites per cell, 21.43 +/- 2.51 x 10(4) in GSNO-treated dogs compared with 26.60 +/- 1.57 x 10(4) in captopril-treated controls (p < 0.05). Average affinity analysis of the binding data demonstrated that this decrease in insulin binding was also due to a decrease in average affinity of the receptor on mononuclear leucocytes for insulin. This was evident by a decrease in empty and filled site affinities in GSNO-treated dogs compared with that of captopril-treated dogs (p < 0.05). It appears that GSNO is exerting its effect by decreasing the number of insulin receptor sites and/or decreasing the average receptor affinity. These results provide evidence for a novel role of NO as a modulator of insulin binding and the involvement of NO in the aetiology of diabetes mellitus.", 
    "606": "Earlier studies have revealed an improvement of cardiac function in animals with congestive heart failure (CHF) due to myocardial infarction (MI) by treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Since heart failure is also associated with attenuated responses to catecholamines, we examined the effects of imidapril, an ACE inhibitor, on the beta-adrenoceptor (beta-AR) signal transduction in the failing heart. Heart failure in rats was induced by occluding the coronary artery, and 3 weeks later the animals were treated with g/(kg x day) (orally) imidapril for 4 weeks. The animals were assessed for their left ventricular function and inotropic responses to isoproterenol. Cardiomyocytes and crude membranes were isolated from the non-ischemic viable left ventricle and examined for the intracellular concentration of Ca2+ [Ca2+]i and beta-ARs as well as adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity, respectively. Animals with heart failure exhibited depressions in ventricular function and positive inotropic response to isoproterenol as well as isoproterenol-induced increase in [Ca2+]i in cardiomyocytes; these changes were attenuated by imidapril treatment. Both beta1-AR receptor density and isoproterenol-stimulated AC activity were decreased in the failing heart and these alterations were prevented by imidapril treatment. Alterations in cardiac function, positive inotropic effect of isoproterenol, beta1-AR density and isoproterenol-stimulated AC activity in the failing heart were also attenuated by treatment with another ACE inhibitor, enalapril and an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, losartan. The results indicate that imidapril not only attenuates cardiac dysfunction but also prevents changes in beta-AR signal transduction in CHF due to MI. These beneficial effects are similar to those of enalapril or losartan and thus appear to be due to blockade of the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "607": "The primary aim of this study was evaluation of the efficacy of telmisartan (angiotensin II receptor blocker- AT(1) blocker) on blood pressure in 10 patients with renal impairment in moderate or advanced stages of renal insufficiency and not dependent on haemodialysis. Its effect on proteinuria, renal function (represented by serum urea, creatinine, glomerular filtration), evaluation of overall therapy compliance in comparison with a previously prescribed angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) were secondary aims. Considering the presence of left ventricle hypertrophy in all patients as a marker of hypertensive cardiopathy, the effect of telmisartan therapy on non-invasive cardiovascular parameters (ECG, echocardiography, and assessment of heart rate variability-HRV) was also evaluated. The study group involved 10 hypertensive patients (6 women, 4 men) with diabetic and non-diabetic renal impairment, proteinuria above 1 g/24 hours, hypertensive cardiopathy and intolerance of ACEI (cough). Telmisartan was added to their long-term antihypertensive combination therapy in a dose of 40 mg for the first 14 days, after which the dose increased to the maximal of 80 mg. The average initial daytime systolic blood pressure (SBP) was 149 +/- 19.7 mm Hg, average night-time SBP 145 +/- 23.0 mm Hg, average initial daytime diastolic BP (DBP) 90.6 +/- 2.5 mm Hg, night-time DBP 88.9 +/- 13.5 mm Hg. Average initial serum creatinine was 207.2 +/- 48.5 micromol/l, urea 15.1 +/- 4.4 mmol/l, GF 0.5 +/- 0.1 ml/s. Echocardiography revealed left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy with well preserved systolic and moderately impaired diastolic LV function. Also the HRV assessment revealed impaired neurovegetative (e.g. sympathovagal) balance. After 1 year of combination therapy with telmisartan, there was a clearly significant reduction in both SBP and DBP in both day and night-time (SBP daytime 149.6 vs.116.6 mm Hg, night-time 145.8 vs. 129.5 mm Hg; DBP daytime 90.6 vs. 83.5 mm Hg, night-time 88.9 vs. 79.3 mm Hg) and proteinuria (2.37 vs. 1.27 g/24 hour, p < 0.05). There were no significant changes in serum creatinine, urea values, and LV functions. On the other hand, further progression of the sympathovagal balance impairment was noted (continuing reduction of HRV in 9 from 10 patients), which can be described as the priority finding. The total compliance of telmisartan therapy was very good and without adverse clinical side effects. In conclusion - telmisartan reduces blood pressure and proteinuria safely and effectively in patients with various types of nephropathy in moderate or advanced stages of renal insufficiency.",

There is currently insufficient data to recommend the routine use of vasoactive agents in patients presenting with claudication. IN THE CASE OF CRITICAL ISCHAEMIA: When faced with this serious situation, one must control the pain and the infection and, all cases, revascularisation should be attempted. Amputation should be proposed in the case of trophic disorders and gangrene. ANGIOGENESIS, A POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVE: This is defined by the budding, from existing vessels, of new vessels under the impact of growth and stabilising factors. It is possible to distinguish arteriogenesis with development of pre-existing collateral vessels, angiogenesis itself that corresponds to the development of small vessels from the large vessels and vasculogenesis, which is the formation of new vessels mediated by circulating endothelial progenitors.",

The obtained three dissolution profiles from one dosage form are the whole formulation profile or \"global profile\" recommended by pharmacopoeias, and, at same time, are recorded two \"individual\" profiles from two drugs present in the formulation. This is the second attempt to obtain simultaneously three dissolution profiles with a single spectrophotometric detector and the first with the multicommutation methodology. The selected pharmaceutical formulations contained a couple of active principles with overlapped spectra, namely sulphamethoxazole and trimethoprim or hydrochlorothiazide and captopril.

    "627": "Patients in the CHARM Programme with symptomatic CHF were randomized to placebo (n=3796) or candesartan (n=3803) and followed for a median of 38 months. NYHA class was assessed at baseline, at two weekly intervals during dose titration and 4 monthly thereafter. Patients were classified as \"better\", \"unchanged\" or \"worse\" at the end of the study compared to baseline. Both a simple \"last visit carried forward\" (LVCF) analysis and \"worst rank carried forward\" (WRCF) analysis (where patients who died were allocated NYHA class V) were used. In the LVCF analysis, compared to placebo, more candesartan patients improved (35.4% versus 32.5%) and fewer worsened (9.0% versus 10.3%) in NYHA class (p=0.003). The WRCF analysis also showed a better overall change in NYHA class with candesartan compared to placebo. There was no heterogeneity in the response to candesartan between the CHARM component trials.",

    "630": "We examined the General Medical Services (GMS) scheme prescribing data for the Eastern region in Ireland for all patients aged 70 years or more (n = 95 055) during July 2001-December 2002. Prescribing indicators applied to the prescription data to evaluate drugs prescribed to each patient were classified as: (1) descriptive, e.g. number of drug items/patient; (2) indicators assessing potentially harmful prescribing; (3) evidence-based indicators, e.g. secondary prevention therapy in those with ischaemic heart disease (IHD). Results are expressed as odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals for comparison of prescribing between the relatively deprived and affluent cohorts, adjusted for age and gender (CI) using logistic regression analysis.", 
    "631": "The relatively deprived cohort was more likely to receive a greater number of drugs (5.2 vs. 4.5, P < 0.0001), more generic products (P = 0.01) and be exposed to major polypharmacy (> or = five drugs) compared with monotherapy (OR = 1.58; 95% CI = 1.52,1.64, P < 0.0001). They were more likely to receive potentially harmful drugs such as cerebral vasodilators (OR = 1.52; 1.38,1.69), long-acting sulphonylurea (OR = 1.43; 1.20,1.72), potentially interacting agents such as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and potassium sparing diuretic (OR = 1.78; 1.48,2.15). In terms of evidence-based prescribing, the relatively deprived cohort with IHD was less likely to receive secondary prevention therapies such as statins (OR = 0.82; 0.74, 0.90) and beta blockers (OR = 0.85; 0.77,0.93).",

    "633": "Hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with an enhanced risk for cardiovascular disease. Patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) show an increased prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia. A decreased biological activity of nitric oxide (NO) may contribute to homocysteine-associated endothelial dysfunction. This study was designed to investigate whether elevated levels of the endogenous NO synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) are involved in endothelial dysfunction in patients with chronic hyperhomocysteinemia and PAD. A total of 76 patients (58 males and 18 females; mean age 65.2 +/- 2.0 years) with PAD were included in the analysis and characterized according to demographic variables and cardiovascular risk factors. Flow-dependent vasodilation (FDD) was determined by high-resolution ultrasound in the radial artery. Total plasma homocysteine (plasma tHcy) and ADMA levels were measured by HPLC. Urinary nitrate was quantified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Patients with plasma tHcy in the highest tertile (n = 27; i.e. > 10.6 micromol/l) had a mean plasma level of 14.4 +/- 1.21 mol/l compared with 9.9 +/- 0.1 micromol/l in those patients in the middle tertile (n = 22; p < 0.05) and 9.4 +/- 0.1 micromol/l in those in the lowest tertile (n = 27; i.e. <9.6 micromol/l; p < 0.05). The hyperhomocysteinemic individuals (highest tertile) had a significantly decreased FDD compared with healthy age-matched controls (n = 15) (7.6 +/- 1.0 vs 13.0 +/- 0.4%; p < 0.05), higher plasma ADMA concentrations (4.0 +/- 0.3 vs 2.6 +/- 0.3 micromol/l; p < 0.05), and a lower urinary nitrate excretion rate (89.5 +/- 13.4 vs 131.3 +/- 17.9 micromol/mmol creatinine; p < 0.05) compared with patients with plasma tHcy in the lowest tertile. Multivariate regression analysis including plasma tHcy, ADMA, total cholesterol, diabetes mellitus, smoking, and systolic blood pressure revealed ADMA as the only significant factor determining FDD (p < 0.05). In conclusion, we demonstrated a stronger relationship between impaired endothelial function and elevated ADMA levels in comparison with plasma tHcy concentrations in patients with PAD and chronic hyperhomocysteinemia. This may raise the question of whether different therapeutical options that interact indirectly with plasma tHcy, i.e. treatment with ACE inhibitors and AT1-receptor blockers to reduce ADMA plasma concentrations or L-arginine, could be a beneficial tool for treating patients with hyperhomocysteinemia.", 
    "634": "Gender differences in the syndrome of heart failure (HF) occur in etiology and pathophysiology and lead to differences in the clinical presentation and course of the syndrome. In addition, gender specific treatment responses and gender associated differences in the behavior of treating physicians are found. Hypertension and diabetes play a major role as causes of HF in women and both interact in their pathophysiology with the renin angiotensin system (RAS). Modulation of the RAS by estrogens explains specific differences between pre- and post-menopausal women and men. Myocardial growth processes and myocardial calcium handling are differentially regulated in female and male myocytes. Myocardial remodeling with age and as a consequence of mechanical load differs in women and men. For yet unknown reasons, HF with preserved systolic function seems to be more frequent in women than in men and the clinical course of systolic HF is different in both genders. Medical therapy in heart failure has usually not been specified according to gender and gender specific analysis has been neglected in most large survival trials. Only a post-hoc analysis of gender differences led to the recognition of increased mortality with digitalis therapy in women. Single studies on angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or beta-receptor blockers did not reach significant end points in women whereas meta-analyses showed overall positive effects. Side effects of ACEI are more common and pharmacokinetics of beta-blockers are different in women. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) are equally well tolerated in women and men. RAS inhibition may be particularly advantageous in postmenopausal women in whom the natural modulation of the RAS by estrogens is lost.", 
    "635": "Heart failure is a highly prevalent disease in aging western populations, associated with a substantially increased risk of thromboembolic events, not only in severe but even in mild to moderate stages. This can partly be attributed to concomitant atrial fibrillation, a well-known risk factor for stroke, as well as a \"hypercoagulable state\" including formation of intraventricular thrombi. Left ventricular dysfunction results in decreased cardiac output, pulmonary congestion and neurohumoral activation with marked stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Besides its contribution to progressive left ventricular remodelling, activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is enhanced in the development of vascular endothelial dysfunction in heart failure, resulting in decreased nitric oxide bioavailability. Nitric oxide, however, controls vascular tone and inhibits platelet activation. Enhanced platelet activation has recently been described in patients with heart failure in sinus rhythm. This article summarises the potential contribution to platelet activation of vascular endothelial dysfunction and reduced formation of the platelet inhibitor nitric oxide, which increase further the risk for thromboembolic events in heart failure. Beneficial modulation of cardiac remodelling, left ventricular function, neurohumoral activation, endothelial dysfunction and platelet activation can be achieved by inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.", 
    "636": "The PRINCEPS study (Prise en charge des Insuffisants Cardiaques: Enqu\u00eate chez les Patients Symptomatiques) was carried out by 1,717 general practitioners who reported their experience with 3,782 patients with cardiac failure treated by an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. This is the largest observational study carried out in general practice in France to date. The average age of the patients with cardiac failure was 71 years, with a majority of men (62%), many of whom were hypertensive (76%) and had other cardiovascular risk factors. The diagnosis of cardiac failure was made by the presence of effort dyspnoea (92%) and confirmed by a cardiologist in 81% of cases. Heart failure was rarely chronic (17%>5 years), usually related to hypertension (58%) and had required hospital admission in only 39% of patients. Finally, the patients were not very symptomatic (63% Class II of the NYHA Classification). Treatment included the obligatory ACE inhibitor at a high dosage (maximal dosage according the European Recommendations) in half the patients. The dosage prescribed was considered optimal in 3 out of 4 patients, and usually treated by the consulting cardiologist (81% of patients). It was higher in the young patients, less symptomatic, and in patients with heart failure due to hypertension. A treatment with betablockers (20%), diuretics (74%), digitalis (21%), was often associated with the ACE inhibitor. These results suggest that heart failure patients treated by general practitioners have hypertension as the main cause. The ACE inhibitors seem to be prescribed initially at high dosage for treating the hypertension, and the dosage is progressively decreased with time and aggravation of the cardiac failure.",

Two independent heterozygous transgenic rat lines were studied, one expressing 2 to 3 copies (L1172) and the other expressing 5 to 10 copies (L1173) of the ACE transgene. These rats were normotensive but developed a proportionate increase in myocardial collagen depending on the ACE gene dose (up to 2.5-fold, P<0.01), but cardiac angiotensin II levels remained normal, whereas collagen content reversed to control levels on ACE inhibition. To explain these changes, we investigated N-acetyl-Ser-Asp-Lys-Pro (AcSDKP), an alternative substrate that is catabolized exclusively by ACE. Increased cardiac expression of ACE was paralleled by a reciprocal decrease in cardiac AcSDKP and a proportionate increase in phosphorylated Smad2 and Smad3, all of which normalized after both ACE inhibition and AcSDKP infusion. Furthermore, a functional link of this signaling cascade was demonstrated, because AcSDKP inhibited Smad3 phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner in cultured cardiac fibroblasts and in vivo.", 
    "647": "Our findings suggest that increased cardiac ACE activity can increase cardiac collagen content by degradation of AcSDKP, an inhibitor of the phosphorylation of transforming growth factor-beta signaling molecules Smad2 and Smad3.

We examine the key differences among the trials-including the ACE inhibitor dose, the ARB and its dose, blood pressure reduction, and patient populations-to present our perspective on ARB use, alone or in combination with ACE inhibitors, in patients with chronic heart failure and post-myocardial infarction left ventricular dysfunction.

    "661": "Patients who have had heart failure (HF) face very high risks of hospitalization and mortality. Despite the compelling scientific evidence that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, aldosterone antagonists, and beta blockers decrease rates of hospitalization and mortality in patients who have had HF, these life-prolonging therapies continue to be underused. Many studies in a variety of clinical settings have documented that important numbers of patients who have had HF are not receiving treatment with these evidence-based therapies, which are recommended by national guidelines, when guided by conventional care. This HF treatment gap results from a variety of complex issues, including lack of systems and disease management programs. This gap in beta-blocker therapy may be due in part to persisting perceptions, despite recent evidence to the contrary, that it should be delayed until patients who developed HF have been stable for 2 to 4 weeks after hospital discharge and that its initiation results in a substantial risk of worsening HF. Conversely, recent clinical trial evidence has substantiated that beta blockers can be safely initiated for patients with HF in the hospital and that there are early benefits, including decreased risks of mortality and hospitalization for worsening HF. It has become increasingly evident that in-hospital initiation of evidence-based cardiovascular therapies and patient education have a positive effect on long-term patient compliance and clinical outcomes. Adopting in-hospital initiation of these therapies as the standard of care (in the absence of contraindications or intolerance) in patients who have HF and stabilized systolic dysfunction could substantially improve treatment rates, decrease the risk of future hospitalizations, and prolong life in the large number of patients who are hospitalized each year for HF.", 
    "662": "Chronic heart failure affects between 1-5% of the population and rise steeply with age. Most patients with chronic heart failure should be routinely managed with a combination of 4 types of drugs: a diuretic, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I), beta-blocker and usually digitalis. Diuretics are essential for symptomatic treatment when fluid overload is present, and should always be administrated in combination with ACE-I if possible. ACE-I improves survival and symptoms and reduces hospitalization in patients with moderate to severe ventricular systolic dysfunction, and in the absence of fluid retention should be given first. Angiotensin II receptor antagonist could be considered in patients who not tolerate ACE-I. beta-blocking agents are recommended for treatment of patients with stable, mild, moderate and severe heart failure unless there is a contraindication. Bisoprolol, metoprolol and carvedilol have been associated with reduction in total mortality, cardiovascular mortality and sudden death. Cardiac glycosides are indicated in atrial fibrillation and any degree of symptomatic heart failure in order slow ventricular rate. Indications for antiarrhythmic drug therapy include atrial fibrillation, non-sustained or sustained ventricular tachycardia. Oral anticoagulation reduces the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation, and there is a lack of evidence to support the use of antithrombotic therapy in patients in sinus rhythm.", 
    "663": "Calcium antagonists were introduced for the treatment of hypertension in the 1980s. Their use was subsequently expanded to additional disorders, such as angina pectoris, paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, Raynaud phenomenon, pulmonary hypertension, diffuse esophageal spasms, and migraine. Calcium antagonists as a group are heterogeneous and include 3 main classes--phenylalkylamines, benzothiazepines, and dihydropyridines--that differ in their molecular structure, sites and modes of action, and effects on various other cardiovascular functions. Calcium antagonists lower blood pressure mainly through vasodilation and reduction of peripheral resistance. They maintain blood flow to vital organs, and are safe in patients with renal impairment. Unlike diuretics and beta-blockers, calcium antagonists do not impair glucose metabolism or lipid profile and may even attenuate the development of arteriosclerotic lesions. In long-term follow-up, patients treated with calcium antagonists had development of less overt diabetes mellitus than those who were treated with diuretics and beta-blockers. Moreover, calcium antagonists are able to reduce left ventricular mass and are effective in improving anginal pain. Recent prospective randomized studies attested to the beneficial effects of calcium antagonists in hypertensive patients. In comparison with placebo, calcium antagonist-based therapy reduced major cardiovascular events and cardiovascular death significantly in elderly hypertensive patients and in diabetic patients. In several comparative studies in hypertensive patients, treatment with calcium antagonists was equally effective as treatment with diuretics, beta-blockers, or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. From these studies, it seems that a calcium antagonist-based regimen is superior to other regimens in preventing stroke, equivalent in preventing ischemic heart disease, and inferior in preventing congestive heart failure. Calcium antagonists are also safe and effective as first-line or add-on therapy in diabetic hypertensive patients. Heart rate-lowering calcium antagonists (verapamil, diltiazem) may have an edge over the dihydropyridines in post-myocardial infarction patients and in diabetic nephropathy. Thus, calcium antagonists may be safely used in the management of hypertension and angina pectoris.",

The only exception is the Beta Blocker Evaluation of Survival Trial (BEST) that studied the efficacy of Bucindolol in heart failure. In that study there appeared to be a unique differential effect in African Americans compared to Caucasians which may have been in part related to the severity of the disease.",

The estimated acceleration factor (which quantifies the effect of one treatment relative to another in accelerating or slowing disease progression) adjusted for predefined baseline characteristics was 0.39 for the comparison between verapamil plus trandolapril and placebo (P=0.01), 0.47 for the comparison between trandolapril and placebo (P=0.01), and 0.83 for the comparison between verapamil and placebo (P=0.54).

The primary end point was the change in the glomerular filtration rate (determined by measuring the plasma clearance of iohexol) between the baseline value and the last available value during the five-year treatment period. Secondary end points included the annual changes in the glomerular filtration rate, serum creatinine level, urinary albumin excretion, and blood pressure; the rates of end-stage renal disease and cardiovascular events; and the rate of death from all causes.",

    "674": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus is becoming a major health problem associated with excess morbidity and mortality. As the prevalence of type 2 diabetes is rapidly increasing, prevention of the disease should be considered as a key objective in the near future. Besides lifestyle changes, various pharmacological treatments have proven their efficacy in placebo-controlled clinical trials, including antidiabetic drugs such as metformin, acarbose and troglitazone, or antiobesity agents such as orlistat. Arterial hypertension, a clinical entity in which insulin resistance is common, is strongly associated with type 2 diabetes and may precede the disease by several years. While antihypertensive agents such as diuretics or beta-adrenoceptor antagonists may worsen insulin resistance and impair glucose tolerance, newer antihypertensive agents exert neutral or even slightly positive metabolic effects. Numerous clinical trials have investigated the effects of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antagonists (ARAs) on insulin sensitivity in hypertensive patients, with or without diabetes, with no consistent results. Almost half of the studies with ACE inhibitors in hypertensive nondiabetic individuals demonstrated a slight but significant increase in insulin sensitivity as assessed by insulin-stimulated glucose disposal during a euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp, while the other half failed to reveal any significant change. The effects of ARAs on insulin sensitivity are neutral in most studies. Mechanisms of improvement of glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity through the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) are complex. They may include improvement of blood flow and microcirculation in skeletal muscles and, thereby, enhancement of insulin and glucose delivery to the insulin-sensitive tissues, facilitating insulin signalling at the cellular level and improvement of insulin secretion by the beta cells. Six recent large-scale clinical studies reported a remarkably consistent reduction in the incidence of type 2 diabetes in hypertensive patients treated with either ACE inhibitors or ARAs for 3-6 years, compared with a thiazide diuretic, beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, the calcium channel antagonist amlodipine or even placebo. The relative risk reduction averaged 14% (p = 0.034) in the CAPPP (Captopril Prevention Project) with captopril compared with a thiazide or beta1-adrenoceptor antagonist, 34% (p < 0.001) in the HOPE (Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation) study with ramipril compared with placebo, 30% (p < 0.001) in the ALLHAT (Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial) with lisinopril compared with chlortalidone, 25% (p < 0.001) in the LIFE (Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction in hypertension study) with losartan compared with atenolol, and 25% (p = 0.09) in the SCOPE (Study on Cognition and Prognosis in the Elderly) with candesartan cilexetil compared with placebo, and 23% (p < 0.0001) in the VALUE (Valsartan Antihypertensive Long-term Use Evaluation) trial with valsartan compared with amlodipine. All these studies considered the development of diabetes as a secondary endpoint, except the HOPE trial where it was a post hoc analysis. These encouraging observations led to the initiation of two large, prospective, placebo-controlled randomised clinical trials whose primary outcome is the prevention of type 2 diabetes: the DREAM (Diabetes REduction Approaches with ramipril and rosiglitazone Medications) trial with the ACE inhibitor ramipril and the NAVIGATOR (Nateglinide And Valsartan in Impaired Glucose Tolerance Outcomes Research) trial with the ARA valsartan. Finally, ONTARGET (ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial) will also investigate as a secondary endpoint whether it is possible to prevent the development of type 2 diabetes by blocking the RAS with either an ACE inhibitor or an ARA or a combination of both. Thus, the recent consistent observations of a 14-34% reduction of the development of diabetes in hypertensive patients receiving ACE inhibitors or ARAs are exciting. From a theoretical point of view, they emphasise that there are many aspects of the pathogenesis, prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes that still need to be uncovered. From a practical point of view, they may offer a new strategy to reduce the ongoing epidemic and burden of type 2 diabetes.",

Because of its proinflammatory effects, angiotensin II participates in the process of atherogenesis.

Angiotensin II also contributes to renal damage secondary to diabetes mellitus by its actions in the intraglomerular hemodynamics and by its glomerular and interstitial fibrogenic effects.

We report here that intracellular factor XIIIA transglutaminase crosslinks agonist-induced AT1 receptor homodimers via glutamine315 in the carboxyl-terminal tail of the AT1 receptor. The crosslinked dimers displayed enhanced signaling and desensitization in vitro and in vivo. Inhibition of angiotensin II release or of factor XIIIA activity prevented formation of crosslinked AT1 receptor dimers. In agreement with this finding, factor XIIIA-deficient individuals lacked crosslinked AT1 dimers. Elevated levels of crosslinked AT1 dimers were present on monocytes of patients with the common atherogenic risk factor hypertension and correlated with an enhanced angiotensin II-dependent monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells. Elevated levels of crosslinked AT1 receptor dimers on monocytes could sustain the process of atherogenesis, because inhibition of angiotensin II generation or of intracellular factor XIIIA activity suppressed the appearance of crosslinked AT1 receptors and symptoms of atherosclerosis in ApoE-deficient mice.", 
    "699": "Vascular reactivity can be modulated by local physical factors as well as pharmacologic manipulations. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of chronic exercise (EX) with or without the ACEI captopril (CAP) on vascular reactivity. Sixty-four Sprague-Dawley male rats were randomized into 4 groups (n = 16): group 1, control; group 2, captopril; group 3, exercise; and group 4, exercise and captopril. After 10 weeks of treatment, rats were killed, and their thoracic aortas harvested. Vascular reactivity was studied in an organ chamber (n = 12). Aortic endothelium constitutive nitric oxyde synthase (NOS3) expression was determined by Western blot analysis (n = 4). Endothelial-dependent relaxation was increased in both CAP and EX rats relative to the control group. Maximal aortic relaxations were enhanced in the CAP group, and potencies of these mediators were enhanced in the EX group (P < 0.05 versus control). Combined treatment did not result in a synergistic effect. NOS3 relative expressions were: group 1, 100%; group 2, 241%; group 3, 64%; and group 4, 108%. Exercise enhanced both potencies and efficacies of the mediators studied, whereas CAP increased mainly their efficacies. NOS3 protein expression was up-regulated in CAP-treated rats but not in exercised rats. These findings suggest different mechanisms for the observed increased vascular reactivity.", 
    "700": "ACE inhibitors are known to ameliorate cardiovascular complications in aging; however, their effects on the coronary circulation in relation to aging and eNOS dependence remain to be examined. Coronary flow responses to bradykinin with or without ACE inhibitors were examined in Langendorff-perfused hearts from young (16-20 weeks) and aged (16-20 months) control and eNOS mice. Western blot analysis was performed for cardiac eNOS, nNOS, and ACE. Baseline coronary flow was comparable between young and aged mice of both strains. Aging did not affect bradykinin-induced coronary flow in either strain. Interestingly, both acute and chronic treatment with an ACE inhibitor markedly augmented the flow response in aged control and eNOS mice. Aged eNOS mice were markedly hypertensive and had larger ventricular mass than control mice. The antihypertensive effect of temocapril was greater in aged eNOS mice, associated with reduction in the ventricular weight in both strains. Western blot analysis demonstrated an increased expression of eNOS in aged control mice, and ACE expression was increased in eNOS mice. These results indicate that coronary flow response to bradykinin is preserved in aged mice even in the absence of eNOS, and an ACE inhibitor augments this response by both eNOS-dependent and -independent mechanisms.", 
    "701": "Insight into the natural course and the clinical features of diabetic retinopathy as well as advances in understanding the pathogenesis and new developments for beneficial treatments of diabetic retinopathy have broadly enlarged during recent years. It is now well accepted that chronic hyperglycemia and arterial hypertension are the most important factors for microvascular damage in diabetes. Although established treatment modalities have not yet yielded prevention of blindness due to diabetes, there is a trend toward a broader therapeutic concept for patients with diabetes including general vasoprotection. In this context, the retina plays a major role as early retinopathy earmarks the vascular high-risk patient with diabetes. Accordingly, every proven measure should be taken to avoid what still happens in evidence-based medicine: \"lost in translation.\"", 
    "702": "Angiotensin II (AII) contributes to the pathogenesis of many cardiovascular disorders. Oxidant-mediated activation of poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) plays a role in the development of endothelial dysfunction and the pathogenesis of various cardiovascular diseases. We have investigated whether activation of the nuclear enzyme PARP contributes to the development of AII-induced endothelial dysfunction. AII in cultured endothelial cells induced DNA single-strand breakage and dose-dependently activated PARP, which was inhibited by the AII subtype 1 receptor antagonist, losartan; the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase inhibitor, apocynin; and the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester. Infusion of sub-pressor doses of AII to rats for 7 to 14 d induced the development of endothelial dysfunction ex vivo. The PARP inhibitors PJ34 or INO-1001 prevented the development of the endothelial dysfunction and restored normal endothelial function. Similarly, PARP-deficient mice infused with AII for 7 d were found resistant to the AII-induced development of endothelial dysfunction, as opposed to the wild-type controls. In spontaneously hypertensive rats there was marked PARP activation in the aorta, heart, and kidney. The endothelial dysfunction, the cardiovascular alterations and the activation of PARP were prevented by the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril. We conclude that AII, via AII receptor subtype 1 activation and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species generation, triggers DNA breakage, which activates PARP in the vascular endothelium, leading to the development of endothelial dysfunction in hypertension.", 
    "703": "Renal diseases, especially chronic renal failure (CRF), are common in canine and feline medicine. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays a pivotal role in these conditions in the development of renal lesions and the progression of kidney dysfunction. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) are currently considered as the most efficient agents in therapeutic strategies. The benefit of an ACEI treatment can be explained by at least three mechanisms: ACEI limit systemic and glomerular capillary hypertension, have an antiproteinuric effect, and retard the development of glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial lesions. These effects have been studied in dogs and cats, and there is now some evidence to support the recommendation of ACEI therapy in dogs and cats with CRF. Nevertheless the prescription of ACEI in such patients should take into account the potential influence of renal impairment on ACEI disposition, and adverse effects on the renal function itself (especially hypotension and acute reductions in glomerular filtration rate). The risk of drug interaction with diuretics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and anesthetics, should not be overestimated. Furthermore, hypotension may occur in patients on a low sodium diet.", 
    "704": "Myocardial infarction is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Multiple therapeutic modalities have been shown to be effective in reducing adverse postmyocardial infarction outcomes. The most prominent drugs that have been used in this group of patients are those that oppose the effects of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. These drugs include beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers and aldosterone blockers. Following initial success with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in reducing mortality and cardiac remodeling in postmyocardial infarction patients, recent focus has been on adjunctive or alternative use of angiotensin II-receptor antagonists. Multiple large-scale, randomized trials have been conducted in order to compare angiotensin II-receptor antagonists with a combination of angiotensin II-receptor antagonists and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors alone in postmyocardial infarction patients and also in heart failure. Although some results are conflicting, the weight of evidence is towards equivalency of these two groups of medicines, provided that the maximum effective dose of the angiotensin II-receptor antagonists is used. The combination of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and an angiotensin II-receptor antagonist may have additional benefits for some, but not all, patients; for example, reducing morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic heart failure but not in postmyocardial infarction patients. Indeed, in the postmyocardial infarction setting, the combination appears simply to increase the side effects, without conferring additional benefits. Use of aldosterone antagonists as adjunctive therapy in postmyocardial infarction patients is associated with added benefits in terms of mortality reduction and will become the standard of care in this group of patients.", 
    "705": "Current practice guidelines provide recommendations for the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease. Following the publication of clinical trials in recent years, this review will highlight some controversial issues: the role of angiotensin and aldosterone antagonists after acute myocardial infarction; the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with stable coronary heart disease and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction; high-intensity lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; use of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors in the elderly; and the targeting of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol with niacin.", 
    "706": "It is increasingly clear that even a small reduction in blood pressure results in a substantial risk reduction of vascular events including ischemic stroke. Recently, several comparative prospective trials of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers have demonstrated that, for equivalent reductions in blood pressure, these drugs may confer a greater effect on the prevention of primary and recurrent ischemic stroke compared with other antihypertensive medications. Given this information from prospective randomized trials, it appears that this class of drugs should be the first-line treatment for hypertension in patients at risk of a first or recurrent ischemic stroke. This review will critically assess the scientific basis and rationale of the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers in primary and secondary stroke prevention.", 
    "707": "Hypertension is a major cardiovascular risk factor, but most patients remain asymptomatic for many years. Successful therapy not only needs to be effective, it also needs to be well tolerated. Angiotensin receptor blockers have emerged as a major therapeutic class because they meet both of these requirements. Numerous studies indicate that all approved angiotensin receptor blockers are highly selective for angiotensin-1 receptors, lower blood pressure as monotherapies, and work well in combination with other drugs - particularly diuretics. The side-effect profile of angiotensin receptor blockers is similar to that of placebo and they have not been associated with known side effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors such as cough and angioneurotic edema. Candesartan cilexetil is an angiotensin receptor blocker with insurmountable binding properties to the angiotensin-1 receptor, long duration of action and improved efficacy. In patients with hypertension, candesartan monotherapy has been shown to be safe and effective. Comparative data have shown similar or better results to other monotherapies in blood-pressure control, and in combination with hydrochlorothiazide it has been shown to have additive or synergistic effects. More recent data demonstrate that candesartan cilexetil is useful in the treatment of patients with heart failure and may protect against diabetic nephropathy. Studies have also shown protection from stroke, particularly in patients with isolated systolic hypertension.", 
    "708": "Diabetes has become the most common single cause of end stage renal disease. Nephrotic syndrome is often manifested in the progression of diabetic nephropathy. Diabetic nephropathy has several pathways for development, such as glomerular hyperfiltration, upregulation of protein kinase C, advanced glycation end products, activation of polyol pathway, increased oxidative stress and upregulation of growth factors. Intensive control of blood pressure and the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker can protect the progression of nephropathy with nephrotic syndrome. However further studies are necessary for the clinical guidline in patients with diabetic nephropathy manifesting with nephrotic syndrome.", 
    "709": "Angiotensin II (AII), the biologically active component of renin-angiotensin system (RAS), acts through two receptor subtypes, the AT1 and AT2 receptor. All classic physiological effects of AII, such as vasoconstriction, aldosterone and vasopressin release, sodium and water retention and sympathetic facilitation, are mediated by the AT1 receptor. The majority of pilot studies demonstrated the renoprotective effect of RAS blockers via antihypertensive, antiproteinuric, antifibrotic action. In order to establish whether RAS blocker causes antiproteinuric effects or long-term renoprotection in the non-diabetic nephrotic disease, larger prospective, randomized controlled trials are required in the future.",

CNF is an autosomal recessive disease, and caused by mutations in the gene (NPHS1) for nephrin which is a key component of the podocyte slit diaphragm. In this review, some special issues concerning clinical and molecular diagnosis for CNS and optimal management of CNF patients were briefly summarized.", 
    "711": "Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is one of the major causes of nephrotic syndrome in adult as well as in the children. Untreated or steroid-resistant primary FSGS often shows a progressive renal insufficiency and reaches to end-stage renal failure. Concerning the treatment for such patients, the combined immunosuppressive therapy with corticosteroid and other cytotoxic drugs (cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine and tacrolimus etc.) is recommended. Since podocyte injury seems to be the most important primary events in FSGS, the extensive studies have been focused on the role of podocyte-related molecules. Recently slit membrane-associated molecules (CD2AP, alpha-actinin 4 and podocin) and angiotensin II type I receptor in the podocyte have been clearly shown to be relevant for the pathogenesis of FSGS.", 
    "712": "Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and/or angiotensin receptor blocker, has been well appreciated as a renoprotective treatment in proteinuric glomerular diseases. However, not all patients with glomerular diseases respond well to this therapy. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and angiotensinogen may be involved in the inter-individual difference in the responsiveness to the renoprotective efficacy of the RAS blockade. This review focuses on the interface between genomics and therapeutics in the renin-angiotensin system in IgA nephropathy, the most prevalent form of primary glomerulonephritis and one of the major causes of end-stage renal disease in the world.", 
    "713": "Proteinuria has been demonstrated to be not only a representative sign of renal lesion but also a risk factor for the progression to renal failure through its injurious effects on tubulointerstitium. The responsible gene for Finnish type congenital nephrotic syndrome was identified and its product was named 'nephrin' which is located on slit membrane between foot processes of glomerular epithelial cells and is considered to be concerned also in the induction of acquired renal lesions with proteinuria. The monoclonal antibody against rat nephrin can induce proteinuria. These facts suggest that the important role for final barrier against macromolecules is played by the slit membrane. Understanding the proteinuria mechanism at molecular level is expected to lead to the establishment of appropriate treatments. Nephrin is regarded as the most promising and attractive molecule for the development of new therapeutic strategy. Many nephrologists are now much interested in the intimate relationship between nephrin and angiotensin II.",

The Research Group on Progressive Renal Disease sponsored by the Ministry of Health Labor and Welfare of Japan reported that 10 to 12% of the cases with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome were classified into this type and that the most common cause in adults is idiopathic membranous nephropathy (40%) and the second is focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (20%). In these conditions, less than 10% progressed to end stage renal disease (ESRD) when urine protein decreased under 1 g/day by the treatment. Persistent proteinuria is not only a marker of irreversible glomerular lesions but also a risk factor for tubulointerstitial lesions, which plays a significant role in progression into ESRD.",

U937 cells were treated with drugs and subsequently the uptake of fluorescent acetylated LDL was assessed by flow cytometry. The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, atorvastatin and simvastatin (1-30 mumol/l), but not calcium channel blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, inhibited the uptake of modified LDL by monocytes. Therefore, atorvastatin and simvastatin may slow down the progression of atherosclerosis by inhibiting the formation of foam cells.",

In this study, we examined the acute and chronic renal and cardiac effects of OMP in rats with compensated [urinary sodium excretion (UNaV) > 1,200 microeq/day] and decompensated (UNaV < 100 microeq/day) CHF, induced by a surgical aortocaval fistula (ACF). Bolus injection of OMP (10 mg/kg) to sham controls produced significant diuretic and natriuretic responses [UNaV increased from 0.67 +/- 0.19 to 3.27 +/- 1.35 microeq/min, P < 0.05; fractional sodium excretion (FENa) increased from 0.23 +/- 0.06 to 0.95 +/- 0.34%, P < 0.01] despite a significant decline in blood pressure (BP). Rats with compensated CHF displayed blunted diuresis and natriuresis to this dose of OMP but a significant decrease in BP. However, in rats with decompensated CHF, OMP induced significant natriuresis (FENa increased from 0.18 +/- 0.15 to 0.82 +/- 0.26%, P < 0.05) despite a further decrease in BP (from 90 +/- 9 to 71 +/- 6 mmHg, P < 0.01). Two weeks after ACF, the heart/body weight ratio was significantly greater in rats with CHF than controls (0.51 +/- 0.026 vs. 0.30 +/- 0.004%, P < 0.0001), and UNaV was significantly lower. Immediate or late (1 or 6 days after ACF) OMP treatment in the drinking water (140 mg/l) reduced cardiac hypertrophy to 0.41-0.43% (P < 0.01) and induced natriuresis. These results suggest that OMP improves both sodium balance and cardiac remodeling and might be advantageous to ACE inhibitors for the treatment of decompensated CHF.", 
    "722": "Evidence has accumulated that some of the angiotensin II AT1 receptor antagonists have insulin-sensitizing property. We thus examined the effect of telmisartan on insulin action using 3T3-L1 adipocytes. With standard differentiation inducers, a higher dose of telmisartan effectively facilitated differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Treatment of both differentiating adipocytes and fully differentiated adipocytes with telmisartan caused a dose-dependent increase in mRNA levels for PPARgamma target genes such as aP2 and adiponectin. By contrast, telmisartan attenuated 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 mRNA level in differentiated adipocytes. Of note, we demonstrated for the first time that telmisartan augmented GLUT4 protein expression and 2-deoxy glucose uptake both in basal and insulin-stimulated state of adipocytes, which may contribute, at least partly, to its insulin-sensitizing ability.", 
    "723": "Accidents caused by the venomous fish Thalassophryne nattereri are characterized by edema, intense pain and necrosis at the site of the sting. This study assessed the nociceptive and edematogenic activities of T. nattereri venom after injection into the mouse hindpaw and determination of the paw licking duration and weight. Subplantar injections of the venom (0.1-6 microg) induced a dose-related increase of the paw licking time and paw swelling with maximal values at 3 microg (209.5 +/- 57.5 s and 135.0 +/- 6.8 mg, respectively). Pretreatment of mice with either indomethacin (10 mg/kg, i.p.), a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, dexamethasone (1 mg/kg, s.c.), a steroid anti-inflammatory agent, cyproheptadine (1 mg/kg, i.p.), antagonist of serotonin receptors or L-NAME (100 mg/kg, s.c.), inhibitor of nitric oxide syntase, did not affect the venom-induced nociceptive and edematogenic responses. Injection of the opioid analgesic fentanyl (0.1 mg/kg, s.c.) reduced the paw licking time induced by 1 microg venom by 84% of control, without affecting the paw swelling. Both nociceptive and edematogenic responses were reduced after treatment with a specific tissue kallikrein inhibitor (TKI, 100 mg/kg, i.p.) by 78% and 24% from control values, respectively. Administration of a specific plasma kallikrein inhibitor (PKSI(527,) 100 mg/kg, s.c.) did not affect the venom-induced nociceptive response, but it decreased the paw edema by 15% from control. After injection of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (100 mg/kg, i.p.) the venom-induced nociceptive end edematogenic responses were increased by two-fold. The role of kallikreins possibly present in the venom was further assessed by hydrolysis of human kininogen and kininogen-derived synthetic peptides, showing the release of kallidin (Lys-bradykinin). The hydrolysis was inhibited by metal chelating agents but not by serino-, aspartyl- or cysteino-proteinase inhibitors. The data suggest that a protease with tissue-kallikrein-like activity plays a major role in nociception and edema induced by T. nattereri venom and this should be considered to achieve efficient treatments for human accidents with this venom.",

    "739": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in hypertension development and cardiovascular structural changes in a salt-sensitive hypertensive model induced by capsaicin (CAP). Newborn male Wistar rats were injected with either capsaicin or vehicle. After weaning at 3 weeks, these rats were divided into the following six treatment groups: capsaicin plus high-salt diet (CAP+HS), control plus high-salt diet (CON+HS), control plus normal salt diet (CON+NS), capsaicin plus high-salt diet and telmisartan (CAP+HS+T, 10 mg/kg/day), capsaicin plus high-salt diet and perindopril (CAP+HS+P, 2 mg/kg/day), and capsaicin plus high-salt diet and spironolactone (CAP+HS+S, 80 mg/kg/day). Treatment with different salt diets and drugs was initiated at 3 weeks of age and lasted 18 weeks. We found that beginning at the second week after the initiation of the treatment, blood pressure became significantly higher in CAP+HS than in other groups, accompanied by the development of cardiac hypertrophy. Treatment with telmisartan, perindopril or spironolactone prevented the development of hypertension in the CAP+HS group. Cardiac hypertrophy was prevented in the perindopril treatment group. The medial thickness, media-to-lumen ratio and cross-sectional area of the thoracic, renal and mesenteric arteries were significantly increased in CAP+HS than in other groups. Lumen diameter was similar in all the vessels among all the groups. Treatment with telmisartan, perindopril or spironolactone prevented the development of vascular remodeling, as found in the CAP+HS group. Beginning at 8 weeks after the initiation of the salt diet treatment (11 weeks of age), blood pressure also became higher in CON+HS than in CON+NS, but lower than CAP+HS. Structural changes of vessels were also present in CON+HS, but the degree of change was less when compared with CAP+HS. We conclude that neonatal treatment with capsaicin plus a high-salt diet, and a high-salt diet alone both induced hypertension development in normal Wistar rats, which are associated with cardiovascular remodeling. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is involved in this salt-sensitive model because treatment that interfered with this system also prevented the development of hypertension and vascular remodeling.",

We previously found that progressive renal disease is associated with increased renal synthesis of endothelin-1 (ET-1) in the face of reduced generation of renal nitric oxide (NO) in the remnant kidney model. Here we compared changes in urinary excretion of ET-1 and nitrite/nitrate, markers of renal ET-1, and NO synthesis, respectively, and urinary cGMP, an indirect index of renal atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) synthesis, after administration of vasopeptidase or ACE inhibitor in rats with renal mass reduction (RMR).",

Enalapril achieved a 47% reduction in proteinuria (277 +/- 81 mg/day, P < 0.01 vs. vehicle) to levels that remained higher (P < 0.01), however, than those after AVE7688. Renal function impairment and glomerular and tubular changes were significantly (P < 0.05 vs. vehicle) ameliorated by AVE7688, and partially affected by enalapril. AVE7688 reduced the abnormal urinary excretion of ET-1 of RMR animals (98 +/- 8 vs. vehicle: 302 +/- 50 pg/24 h, P < 0.001) more than enalapril (159 +/- 14 pg/24 h, P < 0.05 vs. AVE7688). Consistently, AVE7688 was more effective than enalapril in augmenting renal synthesis of NO (2487 +/- 267 and 1519 +/- 217 vs. vehicle: 678 +/- 71 nmol/15 h; P < 0.001, AVE7688 vs. vehicle, P < 0.01 AVE7688 vs. enalapril).

Here, using the anti-Thy1 model of glomerulonephritis, the maximally therapeutic dose of the TGF-beta neutralizing mouse monoclonal antibody (1D11) was determined and compared with the maximally effective dose of enalapril.

Until recently, however, the direct injurious effects of aldosterone on nonclassical tissues such as the brain, heart, and vasculature have been overlooked. Although angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) significantly reduce morbidity and mortality associated with heart disease, preliminary data suggest further benefit with additional aldosterone blockade. The nonselective aldosterone antagonist spironolactone has demonstrated profound morbidity and mortality benefit in heart failure patients, but since its adverse event profile makes it unattractive to patients with milder disease, the need for a selective aldosterone receptor antagonist is evident. Preclinical studies with eplerenone, a recently approved selective aldosterone receptor antagonist, demonstrate a protective effect on nonclassical tissues, thus reducing injury associated with long-term unopposed aldosterone exposure. Early clinical trials with eplerenone have demonstrated additional benefit in hypertension, heart failure, and nephropathy, although long-term morbidity and mortality outcome data in patients with various levels of disease severity are necessary to define the role of eplerenone in current cardiovascular pharmacotherapy.",

    "759": "The results issued from experimental models and randomized controlled clinical trials have shown that the more intense is the blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), the more effective is the prevention of target organ damage. Combined inhibition of the RAS is aimed at more complete blockade of the system through action at two different sites, angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) and AT1 receptors. This is achieved either by neutralizing the rise in renin and angiotensin (Ang) I, which follows the interruption of the Ang II-renin negative feed-back loop, or by directly antagonizing Ang II, whose synthesis is in part independent of the RAS. By comparison with higher doses of single site RAS blockers, a combination of an ACE inhibitor and an AT1 receptor antagonist block more effectively the RAS. After the demonstration of its synergistic or additive blood pressure lowering effects in sodium depleted normotensive subjects and animal models, combined blockade of the RAS was shown to be more efficient than single site RAS blockade: 1. in lowering blood pressure in hypertensive patients; 2. in lowering proteinuria and possibly retarding progression of renal failure in patients with diabetic and non-diabetic nephropathy; 3. finally, in improving left ventricular remodelling, cardiac function status and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with congestive heart failure. The advantage offered by combining two RAS blockers is to increase the beneficial effect of cardioprotection and nephroprotection which are currently demonstrated with the highest doses of an ACE inhibitor or an AT1 receptor antagonist.",

    "774": "Temocapril is an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), a prodrug with a thiazepine ring. Its active form, temocaprilat, is slightly more potent than enalaprilat in inhibiting ACE isolated from rabbit lung. The inhibitory potency of temocaprilat on isolated rat aorta is 3 times that of enalaprilat. Temocapril is excreted in the bile and urine and can be used in patients with renal insufficiency. It reduces blood pressure without causing any significant change in heart rate or cardiac output. Temocapril has been reported to improve endothelial dysfunction in vitro by suppressing increased oxidative stress. In vivo it improves reactive hyperemia in patients with essential hypertension. It has been reported to prevent coronary vascular remodeling in vivo by suppressing local ACE and increased oxidative stress. In humans temocapril has been found to improve insulin resistance partly by increasing adiponectin levels. Cardiac remodeling was improved by temocapril not only in experiment animals but also in humans. It improves renal function and decreases urinary albumin excretion in diabetics as well as in hypertensive patients. Temocapril is currently marketed only in Japan. Considering its beneficial effects and unique pharmacokinetics, temocapril, is likely to be introduced in other countries as well.",

Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) (n =73) were divided into 6 groups to receive the following diet and drug regimens for 8 weeks: 1) low salt controls (NaCl 0.5%); 2) high salt controls (NaCl 6%); 3) omapatrilat (40 mg/kg/d) on a high salt diet; 4) losartan (30 mg/kg/d) on a high salt diet; 5) hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ; 10 mg/kg/d) on a high salt diet; and 6) losartan+HCTZ (30+10 mg/kg/d) on a high salt diet. Blood pressure was measured by tail-cuff plethysmography. The histological score of myocardial damage, myocardial collagen volume fraction (CVF), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) expression and cardiomyocyte apoptosis were determined. As an antihypertensive, omapatrilat showed greater efficacy than monotherapy with losartan or HCTZ, and was equally effective as the combination of losartan+HCTZ. Assessed by myocardial damage score, omapatrilat and losartan protected cardiac morphology better than HCTZ or the drug combination. Omapatrilat decreased CVF to a greater extent than the other therapies, whereas losartan was most effective in decreasing CTGF expression. All drug treatments, except HCTZ, decreased cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Our findings provide evidence that both vasopeptidase inhibition and AT1-receptor blockade exert cardioprotective properties beyond their blood pressure-lowering effects.

Inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme potentiate bradykinin-mediated vasodilatation and endothelial tissue plasminogen activator release. Combined angiotensin-converting enzyme and neutral endopeptidase inhibition may have additional beneficial cardiovascular effects mediated through bradykinin potentiation. We investigated the effects of local neutral endopeptidase inhibition on the vascular actions of bradykinin in heart failure patients maintained on chronic angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition. Ten patients received intrabrachial infusion of thiorphan (30 nmol/min), a neutral endopeptidase inhibitor, in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial. Thiorphan was coinfused with Lys-des-Arg9-bradykinin (1 to 10 nmol/min), bradykinin (30 to 300 pmol/min), atrial natriuretic peptide (10 to 100 pmol/min), and sodium nitroprusside (2 to 8 mug/min). Bradykinin, atrial natriuretic peptide, and sodium nitroprusside caused dose-dependent vasodilatation (peak blood flow 14.4+/-2.2, 3.6+/-0.6, and 8.6+/-1.3 mL per 100 mL/min, respectively; P<0.0001). Bradykinin caused dose-dependent increases in tissue plasminogen activator antigen and activity (peak concentration 31.8+/-3.4 ng/mL and 21.9+/-7.6 IU/mL, respectively; P<0.001) and estimated antigen and activity release (peak release 152+/-46 ng per 100 mL/min and 154+/-22 IU/100 mL/min, respectively; P<0.005).

Considering that alpha(2)-adrenergic receptors exist in the LPBN and the similar origin of serotonergic and adrenergic afferent pathways to the LPBN, in this study we investigated the effects of bilateral injections of moxonidine alone or combined with RX 821002 (alpha(2)-adrenergic antagonist) into the LPBN on 1.8% NaCl and water intake induced by the treatment with s.c. furosemide (10mg/kg)+captopril (5 mg/kg). Additionally, we investigated if moxonidine into the LPBN would modify furosemide+captopril-induced c-fos expression in the forebrain. Male Holtzman rats with cannulas implanted bilaterally in the LPBN were used. Contrary to forebrain injections, bilateral LPBN injections of moxonidine (0.1, 0.5 and 1 nmol/0.2 microl) strongly increased furosemide+captopril-induced 1.8% NaCl intake (16.6+/-2.7, 44.5+/-3.2 and 44.5+/-4.3 ml/2 h, respectively, vs. vehicle: 6.9+/-1.5 ml/2 h). Only the high dose of moxonidine increased water intake (23.3+/-3.8 ml/2 h, vs. vehicle: 12.1+/-2.6 ml/2 h). Prior injections of RX 821002 (10 and 20 nmol/0.2 microl) abolished the effect of moxonidine (0.5 nmol) on 1.8% NaCl intake. Moxonidine into the LPBN did not modify furosemide+captopril-induced c-fos expression in forebrain areas related to the control of fluid-electrolyte balance. The results show that the activation of LPBN alpha(2)-adrenergic receptors enhances furosemide+captopril-induced 1.8% NaCl and water intake. This enhancement was not related to prior alteration in the activity of forebrain areas as suggested by c-fos expression. Previous and present results indicate opposite roles for alpha(2)-adrenergic receptors in the control of sodium and water intake according to their distribution in the rat brain.",

This suggests that calcium may actually raise blood pressure a bit in some patients with high-renin hypertension, a prediction that is borne out in rodent models of this disorder. There is limited clinical evidence that long-term calcium supplementation tends to raise plasma renin activity; this finding, if valid, could evidently rationalize the equivocal clinical impact of calcium on blood pressure. Salt restriction likewise boosts renin production, and this effect tends to most notable in subjects whose blood pressure fails to decline during low-salt diets. Two clinical groups have demonstrated that salt restriction has a larger and more consistently beneficial impact on the blood pressure of hypertensives when they concurrently are treated with ACE inhibitors - evidently because the physiological impact of the associated rise in renin is blunted. Analogous logic suggests that calcium supplementation may be more beneficial for hypertensives in the context of ACE inhibition or blockade of angiotensin II receptors; this supposition that can readily be tested clinically. The imminent availability of safe nutraceutical ACE inhibitors may make it more feasible for the general public to benefit from these therapeutic/preventive possibilities.", 
    "819": "The formation of new blood vessels is the initial step in progressive tumour development and metastasis. The first stage in tumour angiogenesis is the activation of endothelial cells. Copper ions stimulate proliferation and migration of endothelial cells. It has been shown that serum copper concentration increases as the cancer disease progresses and correlates with tumour incidence and burden. Copper ions also activate several proangiogenic factors, e.g., vascular endothelial growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, tumour necrosis factor alpha and interleukin 1. This review concerns a brief introduction into the basics of tumour blood vessel development as well as the regulatory mechanisms of this process. The role of copper ions in tumour angiogenesis is discussed. The new antiangiogenic therapies based on a reduction of copper levels in tumour microenvironment are reviewed.", 
    "820": "The aim of this study was to elucidate protein circuitry in breast cancer based on the profiling of hormone-receptor-negative breast carcinomas using morphoproteomic and pharmacoproteomic techniques. Three human breast carcinoma cell lines (SKBR-3, MDA-175, MDA-231) were reacted by immunohistochemical (IHC) procedures to detect several categories of protein analytes. Immunoreactivities and cell compartmentalizations were scored from 0 to 3+ positivity using bright-field microscopy. An automated cellular imaging system (ACIS) was used to obtain a final combined score of staining intensity and positive cells in the IHC reactions, to enable comparisons with the visual scores and the rates of inhibition by pharmaceutical agents. FDA-approved inhibitors that target the protein circuitry were added to the cultures for 2-4 days. Proliferation assays were conducted, and in vitro inhibition rates were calculated as (control - treated)/control. Western blot analyses of whole cell lysates assessed the effects of the pharmaceutical agents on selected aspects of protein circuitry. Good to excellent correlation was observed between visual scores and ACIS scores (r values from 0.732 to 0.996 in 10 of 11 trials). Gleevec produced growth inhibition that correlated with the composite expressions of the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) family of ligands and receptors; captopril inhibited only MDA-175, consistent with its unique expression of plasmalemmal angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE); and interferon (IFN)-alpha effected growth inhibition in accordance with the degree of conventional (c) protein kinase C (PKC)-alpha and phosphorylated (p)-PKCalpha/betaII expressions. Western blot analyses revealed correlative changes of several intracellular signals following incubation with these inhibitors. This study shows (a) a close association between the immunohistochemical expression of signal transduction markers and in vitro inhibition by pharmaceutical agents, and (b) correlations between the sites of action of the pharmaceutical agents and the downstream expression of proteins in hormone-receptor-negative breast cancer cell lines. Such morphoproteomic and pharmacoproteomic profiling of individual tumors may enable the pathologist and oncologist to design antitumor therapy that is customized for an individual patient.", 
    "821": "Ventriculo-arterial coupling, defined as the ratio of the effective afterload (Ea) to contractility (Ees), reflects the mechano-energetic performance of the heart and is increased in chronic heart failure (CHF); the aim of treatment is to reduce its value. We studied the effect of carvedilol on the Ea/Ees ratio in patients with CHF treated with ACE-inhibitors, diuretics, and digoxin.", 
    "822": "Between November 1999 and October 2001, 36 consecutive ambulatory patients (aged 31 to 76 years) with stable CHF and idiopathic or hypertensive cardiomyopathy, in sinus rhythm and with a left ventricular ejection fraction < or = 40%, were started on carvedilol and the dose was increased to the maximum tolerated. Ees was calculated as the left ventricular systolic pressure--taken as the systolic arterial pressure measured using the cuff manometer simultaneously with two-dimensional echocardiographic recordings--divided by the left ventricular end-systolic volume. Ea was measured as the ratio of the left ventricular systolic pressure to the stroke volume. All patients were investigated prospectively after 6 and 12 months of treatment.", 
    "823": "Out of 36 patients, 4 did not tolerate the drug and were dropped out. At 6.35 +/- 1 months, the daily dosage of carvedilol was 49.7 +/- 21 mg. The NYHA functional class improved from 1.52 +/- 0.67 to 1.29 +/- 0.53 (p = 0.017), the heart rate markedly diminished from 73.6 +/- 13.3 to 60.8 +/- 10.8 b/min (p < 0.001) and so did Ea (3.35 +/- 0.91 to 2.84 +/- 0.93, p = 0.001). Peripheral resistances and Ees did not change. Therefore, the decrease in the Ea/Ees ratio (2.61 +/- 0.78 vs 2.19 +/- 0.89, p = 0.004) and the related increase in left ventricular ejection fraction (28.8 +/- 5.68 vs 33.3 +/- 7.5%, p < 0.001) were due to the decrease in Ea, while Ees did not vary significantly. Moreover, the Ea reduction was related linearly to the decrease in heart rate (r = 0.46, p = 0.001). There was no change in diuretic or ACE-inhibitor dosing during carvedilol titration. At 14.7 +/- 2 months of follow-up, no further variation occurred, short of a trend toward a slight increase in Ees (1.38 +/- 0.49 to 1.58 +/- 0.65, p = 0.07).", 
    "824": "Carvedilol, added to the conventional therapy of CHF, improves left ventricular performance and reduces the Ea/Ees ratio by decreasing Ea, mainly through a reduction in heart rate. This effect is already evident at 6 months and persists later on, while only after 12 months does Ees tend to increase slightly.",

Additionally, DOPPS has reported on the associations between vascular access outcomes and related medications.", 
    "827": "Prescription of statins varied widely across countries, with the highest use in the United States. Patients prescribed statins had lower risk of cardiac and noncardiac causes of mortality than those who were not prescribed statins. DOPPS data also show that statins are underprescribed relative to recent Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines. No guidelines have been established for analgesic use, but high pain levels self-reported by hemodialysis patients suggest opportunities for improved pain management strategies. Guidelines for analgesic use in dialysis patients may help balance improved quality of life against potential side effects of analgesics. Medical and patient questionnaires show that depression in hemodialysis patients is common, frequently underdiagnosed, usually untreated, and associated with increased rates of mortality and hospitalization. Calcium channel blockers were associated with improved primary graft patency, aspirin with improved secondary graft patency, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors with improved secondary fistula patency. All 3 medications were associated with significantly decreased relative risk for access failure. There is large country variation in multivitamin use, with significantly higher use in the United States compared with Europe and Japan. Patients taking multivitamins had lower mortality risk than patients not taking multivitamins.",

    "829": "ANG II plays a major role in development of cardiac hypertrophy through its AT1 receptor subtype, whereas angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are effective in reversing effects of ANG II on the heart. The objective of this study was to investigate the role of PKA and PKC in the contractile response of atrial tissue during development and ACE inhibitor-induced regression of eccentric hypertrophy induced by aortocaval shunt. At 1 wk after surgery, sham and shunt rats were divided into captopril-treated and untreated groups for 2 wk. Then isometric contraction was assessed by electrical stimulation of isolated rat left atrial preparations superfused with Tyrode solution in the presence or absence of specific inhibitors KT-5720 (for PKA) and Ro-32-0432 (for PKC) and high Ca2+. Peak tension developed was greater in shunt than in sham hearts. However, when expressed relative to tissue mass, hypertrophied muscle showed weaker contraction than muscle from sham rats. In sham rats, peak tension developed was more affected by PKC than by PKA inhibition, whereas this differential effect was reduced in the hypertrophied heart. Treatment of shunt rats with captopril regressed left atrial hypertrophy by 67% and restored PKC-PKA differential responsiveness toward sham levels. In the hypertrophied left atria, there was an increase in the velocity of contraction and relaxation that was not evident when expressed in specific relative terms. Treatment with ACE inhibitor increased the specific velocity of contraction, as well as its PKC sensitivity, in shunt rats. We conclude that ACE inhibition during eccentric cardiac hypertrophy produces a negative trophic and a positive inotropic effect, mainly through a PKC-dependent mechanism.", 
    "830": "Microalbuminuria is a marker for generalized vascular dysfunction. Its prevalence in United States and European general population surveys ranges from 6% to 10%. Increased risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality begins with albumin excretion rates that are well within normal limits. Although microalbuminuria interacts with the traditional cardiovascular risk factors, it has an independent relationship to renal and cardiovascular outcomes. For example, microalbuminuria doubles the risk for a cardiovascular event in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus even after adjusting for the usual risk factors. Elevated rates of urinary albumin excretion predict target organ damage, notably renal disease, but are also related to left ventricular dysfunction, stroke, and myocardial infarction. Screening for microalbuminuria, which is recommended by several expert committees and associations, has become a readily accessible procedure. Screening can give clinicians prognostic information concerning cardiovascular risk and assist in guiding therapy. The goal of treatment is to prevent progression of, and even to reverse, microalbuminuria. Abundant evidence demonstrates that antihypertensive therapy is an important key to the control of urinary albumin excretion, and blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers) is the treatment of choice. These drugs have successfully halted or delayed the progression to nephropathy and have reversed elevated rates of albumin excretion to normal values, even when blood pressure reduction has been minimal.",

    "832": "Sixty-eight men (aged 52 +/- 11 years) with coronary artery disease (CAD) defined as >/=70% diameter stenosis, and a control group of 68 men, matched for age and risk factors without angiographic CAD were studied by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Patients were defined as nondippers when the nighttime systolic and diastolic BP decrease was <10%. Medications included beta-blockers in 20 (15%), calcium antagonists in 39 (29%), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in 44 (32%), angiotensin receptor blockers in 21 (15%), and diuretics in 37 (27%) patients. A logistic regression model was used to define independent predictors of angiographic CAD. Covariates were symptoms, total cholesterol, daytime BP, and nondipping.", 
    "833": "A larger proportion of patients with CAD were nondippers as compared to control subjects (49 [72%] v 31 [46%], P < .005). In a logistic regression model, nondipping was associated with coronary artery stenosis independent of other clinical parameters (odds ratio 3.6, 95% confidence interval 1.6-8.8).",

    "835": "About two thirds of patients on renal replacement therapy irreversibly lose their kidney function because of progressive nephropathies, such as diabetic nephropathy and nondiabetic chronic renal disease. Halting the progression of these patients to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is instrumental to substantially decrease the need and cost for renal replacement therapy. A large number of experimental studies have demonstrated that chronic nephropathies share common pathogenic mechanisms that contribute to renal disease progression, even independently of the original etiology. Actually, a variety of insults may result in a common pathway of systemic hypertension, increased glomerular pressure and protein ultrafiltration, glomerular and tubular protein overload, chronic inflammation and, ultimately, scarring. Experimental and clinical data converge to indicate that in chronic renal disease increased protein traffic is nephrotoxic, proteinuria predicts disease progression, and proteinuria reduction is renoprotective. Initial clinical trials, mostly in patients with no or mild proteinuria, failed to demonstrate that ACE inhibition therapy is renoprotective in nondiabetic chronic nephropathies. Consistently, meta-analyses based on data generated by these trials failed to detect a specific, blood pressure-independent, renoprotective effect of ACE inhibition therapy. The Ramipril Efficacy In Nephropathy (REIN) study found that ACE inhibitors, by reducing urinary proteins, may contribute to improve the outcome of nondiabetic renal disease, and reduce the risk of progression to ESRD by about 50%. Cumulative meta-analyses, including the REIN study results, confirmed and extended these findings. Thus, well-designed trials in properly selected and carefully monitored study populations continue to be the best approach to test the efficacy of novel treatments. The meta-analyses may help confirming the consistency of these findings and their generalizability to larger cohorts of patients.", 
    "836": "Albuminuria has been identified as a marker for predicting both cardiovascular and renal risk. From normal to overt proteinuria levels, albuminuria shows a continuous marked increase in risk. This is independent of other well-known cardiovascular and renal risk markers and factors, such as blood pressure, cholesterol, smoking, overweight, and others. The predictive power is not only present in already diseased populations with either nondiabetic or diabetic renal disease, but also in hypertensive and even in otherwise healthy populations. New antihypertensive intervention strategies, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor-antagonists are claimed to have cardioprotective and renoprotective benefits that go beyond blood pressure control. Interestingly, these new therapeutic classes share the ability to lower urinary albumin excretion by an average of 40%, a characteristic that is not observed with the other antihypertensive drug classes. This short-term-induced antiproteinuric effect appears to predict the long-term cardiovascular and renal protection: the more albuminuria is lowered, the more that individual (or group) is protected. These data suggest that albumin is not only a risk marker for cardiovascular and or renal disease, but it may also be a useful target for therapy. Monitoring of albuminuria should be daily practice in subjects at risk for cardiovascular and renal disease. In addition to new clinical trials that prove that albumin can be targeted to obtain cardiovascular protection, guidelines should be made to help the physician in deciding how to measure albumin in the urine, what are normal levels, how to target \"abnormal\" levels, and how low we should go.", 
    "837": "Two studies comparing the cost-effectiveness of irbesartan to similar blood pressure control with standard antihypertensive medications (excluding angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and other angiotensin receptor blockers) in treatment of patients with hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and microalbuminuria have been published to date; one in a United States setting, the other in a Spanish setting. Both studies were based on a Markov-based Monte Carlo simulation model, with the effects of irbesartan or standard blood pressure control taken from the Irbesartan Reduction of Microalbuminuria-2 (IRMA-2) and the Irbesartan in Diabetic Nephropathy Trial (IDNT) clinical trials. In both Spanish and U.S. settings, irbesartan was projected to delay the onset of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), reduce the cumulative incidence of ESRD, increase life expectancy, and reduce overall direct medical costs. Irbesartan treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and microalbuminuria may lead to major improvements in long-term patient outcomes, with substantial cost savings as an added bonus to third party payers.",

In addition, dual blockade lowered total and LDL-cholesterol 0.3 from 5.4 mmol/L and 3.1 mmol/L, respectively (P < or = 0.01). The antialbuminuric response to dual blockade of the RAS was influenced by the insertion (I)/deletion (D) polymorphism in the ACE gene.",

    "844": "Valsartan reduced the albumin excretion rate consistent with its renoprotective effects. Renal and skin collagen accumulation of the non-fluorescent AGE carboxymethyllysine (CML) were increased in animals with diabetes, but normalized following treatment with valsartan. Renal fluorescence and skin collagen pentosidine levels were also increased by diabetes. However, valsartan only provided a modest attenuation of these parameters. In addition, diabetes was associated with increased plasma fluorescence, which was unaffected by AT1 antagonism.",

    "846": "The role of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE, peptidyl dipeptidase A) in metamorphic- and reproductive-related events in the Egyptian cotton leafworm, Spodoptera littoralis (Lepidoptera, Noctuidae) was studied by using the selective ACE inhibitor captopril. Although oral administration of captopril had no effect on larval growth, topical administration to new pupae resulted in a large decrease of successful adult formation. Oviposition and overall appearance of adults emerging from treated larvae did not differ significantly from those emerging from non-treated larvae. In contrast, topical or oral administration of captopril to newly emerged adults caused a reduction in oviposition. By evaluating the effect of captopril on ecdysteroid titers and trypsin activity, we revealed an additional physiological role for ACE. Captopril exerted an inhibitory effect on ecdysteroid levels in female but not in male adults. Larvae fed a diet containing captopril exhibited increased trypsin activity. A similar captopril-induced increase in trypsin activity was observed in female adults. In male adults, however, captopril elicited reduced levels of trypsin activity. Our results suggest that captopril downregulates oviposition by two independent pathways, one through ecdysteroid biosynthesis regulation, and the other through regulation of trypsin activity. Apparently, fecundity is influenced by a complex interaction of ACE, trypsin activity, and ecdysteroid levels.",

An enzyme immunoassay (EIA) protocol was developed for the quantification of beta-LG f(142-148) in whey protein hydrolysates and in human blood serum. The minimum detection limit was 3 ng/mL. The level of the peptide in whey protein hydrolysates was influenced by the degree of hydrolysis (DH). As expected, highest levels of this peptide were found in hydrolysates generated with trypsin. Sequential incubation of hydrolysates at different DH values with pepsin and Corolase PP, to simulate gastrointestinal digestion, generally resulted in the degradation of beta-LG f(142-148) as determined by EIA. Reversed-phase HPLC and angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) activity assays demonstrated that synthetic beta-LG f(142-148) was rapidly degraded upon incubation with human serum. Furthermore, beta-LG f(142-148) could not be detected by EIA in the sera of 2 human volunteers following its oral ingestion or in sera from these volunteers subsequently spiked with beta-LG f(142-148). These in vitro results indicate that beta-LG f(142-148) is probably not sufficiently stable to gastrointestinal and serum proteinases and peptidases to act as an hypotensive agent in humans following oral ingestion.

Descriptors calculated with CoMFA, CoMSIA, EVA, HQSAR, and traditional 2D and 2.5D descriptors were used for developing models with partial least squares (PLS). In addition, the genetic function approximation algorithm, genetic PLS, and back-propagation neural networks were used for deriving models from 2.5D descriptors (i.e., 2D descriptors and 3D descriptors calculated from CORINA structures and Gasteiger-Marsili charges). Predictive accuracy was assessed using designed test sets. It was found that HQSAR generally performs as well as CoMFA and CoMSIA; other descriptor sets performed less well. When 2.5D descriptors were used, only neural network ensembles were found to be similarly or more predictive than PLS models. In addition, we show that many cross-validation procedures yield similar estimates of the interpolative accuracy of methods. However, the lack of correspondence between cross-validated and test set predictive accuracy for four sets underscores the benefit of using designed test sets.",

ACE-I were more likely to be the first treatment in patients with diabetes [odds ratio (OR)=3.9; 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.2-4.9] or hypercholesterolemia (OR=1.4; 95% CI 1.1-1.8). ARBs were more likely to be the initial treatment in patients with asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR=1.6; 1.2-2.3), diabetes (OR=2.1; 1.5-2.9) or hypercholesterolemia (OR=1.7; 1.2-2.4).", 
    "865": "The increased use of ACE-I is mostly restricted to hypertensive patients with comorbidities for which their use has been recommended. Trends in prescribing of ARBs are not related to relevant comorbidities.", 
    "866": "1. Endothelial function is impaired in hypertension and ageing and this may be associated with an increase in cardiovascular disease. Several clinical studies have shown that blocking the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) improves endothelial function not only in hypertensive patients, but also in normotensive patients with cardiovascular disease. 2. The aim of the present study was to test whether endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF)-mediated smooth muscle hyperpolarization and relaxation are altered in hypertension and ageing and, if so, whether chronic treatment with RAS inhibitors (the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril and the angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonist candesartan) would correct such changes. 3. Endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor-mediated responses were examined in mesenteric arteries from 12-month-old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and 3-, 6-, 12- and 24-month-old normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. Furthermore, both strains were treated for 3 months with either RAS blockers or a conventional therapy with hydralazine and hydrochlorothiazide from 9 to 12 months of age. 4. In arteries of 12-month-old SHR, EDHF-mediated responses were impaired compared with age-matched WKY rats. In SHR, all antihypertensive treatments improved the impairment of EDHF-mediated responses; however, RAS inhibitors tended to improve these responses to a greater extent compared with conventional therapy with hydralazine and hydrochlorothiazide. 5. In arteries of WKY rats, EDHF-mediated responses were impaired at the age of 12 and 24 months compared with 3- and 6-month-old rats, with the response tending to be impaired to a greater extent in 24-month-old rats. 6. Three months of treatment of WKY rats, until 12 months of age, with RAS inhibitors, but not with conventional therapy with hydralazine and hydrochlorothiazide, improved the age-related impairment of EDHF-mediated responses, despite a similar reduction in blood pressure by both treatments. 7. These findings suggest that: (i) EDHF-mediated hyperpolarization and relaxation decline with hypertension and ageing in rat mesenteric arteries; (ii) antihypertensive treatment restores the impaired EDHF-mediated responses in hypertension; (iii) RAS inhibitors may be more efficacious in improving endothelial dysfunction associated with hypertension; and (iv) chronic treatment with RAS inhibitors improves the age-related impairment of EDHF-mediated responses, presumably through the blockade of RAS but not blood pressure lowering alone.", 
    "867": "Aldosterone is one the representative cardiovascular hormones involved in the blood pressure and body-fluid homeostasis. Elevation of aldosterone leads to systemic hypertension through its action on the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) in the kidney. More recent studies demonstrated that aldosterone may produce target organ damage through its direct actions on the non-epithelial MR of the heart in addition to its systemic effects. Clinical experience in primary aldosteronism supports the concept that aldosterone is a risk factor of cardiovascular complications, since concentric type of cardiac hypertrophy is most common in primary aldosteronism among various types of endocrine hypertension. Clinical mega-trial in congestive heart failure (RALES study, EPHESUS study) demonstrated blocking angiotensin II action is not sufficient for cardioprotection unless aldosterone action is equally blocked. An important phenomenon related to this issue is the aldosterone breakthrough which implies a reelevation of plasma aldosterone during chronic administration of ACE inhibitors and Angiotensin receptor antagonists. Normal level of aldosterone could still be a risk factor. Combination of ACE inhibitor or ARB with aldosterone antagonist could result in a better cardioprotection in cardiovascular diseases. Although spironolactone has been the only one aldosterone antagonist, a new antagonist eplerenone has been developed. Eplerenone is specific to MR and is practically devoid of the major side effect gynecomastia of spironolactone. Another topic of aldosterone is its very quick cardiovascular effect presumably via a non-genomic action. All these recent findings support that this adrenocortical steroid hormone is as important as angiotensin II. Determining aldosterone levels is therefore much morel important than before in the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases.", 
    "868": "The risk of cardiovascular disease is markedly increased in patients with type 2 diabetes with a prevalence twice as high compared to the background population. With the recognition of multiple concomitant risk factors for both microvascular as well as cardiovascular disease in type 2 diabetic patients, treatment strategies have changed during recent years. This review focuses on the many recent drug trials that have set the course for an effective multifactorial treatment of the disease. Thus, the Steno-2 Study has shown that an intensified multifactorial intervention targeting several risk factors for cardiovascular disease is capable of reducing the risk for a combined endpoint of cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, coronary interventions, revascularisation to legs, and amputations by 50%.", 
    "869": "Incidence of chronic renal failure has a worldwide tendency to growth. Hypertension occupies an important place among causes of this upward trend. That is why in patients with hypertension and incipient changes of the kidneys it seems most appropriate to use antihypertensive drugs with renoprotective properties. Early treatment with these drugs enables most effective lowering of risk of renal failure development and thus has a potential to prolong life of a patient. Selective microproteinuria is considered to be a marker of incipient renal impairement. Among groups of antihypertensive agents angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, calcium antagonists, beta-blockers, and diuretics have proven renoprotective properties.", 
    "870": "Patients (n=28) with mild to moderate hypertension and depression were given enalapril (20 mg/day). If target blood pressure was not achieved in 10 days hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg/day) was added. These patients were randomized into 2 groups in one of which antihypertensive therapy was supplemented with citalopram (20 mg/day) for 6 weeks. Psychological status was assessed by Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Total BDI score in citalopram group decreased 51% (-12.2+/-1.5; p<0.001). Complete reduction of symptoms of depression (BDI score <19) occurred in 86% of patients. There was no significant lowering of BDI score in control group. STAI score among citalopram treated patients with concomitant anxiety (STAI score >50) decreased from initial 62.9+/-2.1 to 46.3+/-3.1 by week 6 (p<0.001). Only minor changes of STAI score took place in control group. According to data of 24-hour monitoring lowering of systolic blood pressure time indexes was somewhat more pronounced in citalopram group than in control group (24 hour -49.8 and -34.4%, diurnal -56.6 and -42%, nocturnal -37.9 and -23%, respectively).",

Repeat study in 3, 6 and 12 months revealed substantial improvement of baroreflex sensitivity in patients treated with perindopril especially when it was combined with amiodarone, metoprolol, bisoprolol and carvedilol but not with atenolol. Combined therapy with amiodarone and carvedilol provided greatest reduction of sudden arrhythmic and total mortality.

A transmission Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) microspectroscopy equipped with a thermal analyzer was used. The secondary structural composition of solid-state native HSA was 54% alpha-helices (1655 cm(-1)), 22% beta-turns (1679 cm(-1)), and 23% beta-sheets (1633 cm(-1)). After ethanol treatment, a new peak was observed at 1690 cm(-1), and the peak at 1633 cm(-1) was more apparent in the HSA precipitates. The corresponding compositions consisted of 59% alpha-helices, 17% beta-turns, and 24% beta-sheets. After treatment with captopril with or without ethanol, the percentage of alpha-helices and beta-turns decreased in both HSA precipitates, but the percentage of beta-sheets increased. The temperature-dependent structural transformation from alpha-helices/random coils to beta-sheets for the solid-state HSA samples occurred at markedly different onset temperatures. The onset temperature for native HSA was 85 degrees C, and that for HSA precipitates obtained from ethanol, captopril, or captopril/ethanol was 100, 48 or 57 degrees C, respectively. The thermal-induced structural transformation from alpha-helices/random coils to beta-sheets implies a partial unfolding structure in these HSA samples.",

Chinese patients aged 18 to 80 years with primary hypertension were enrolled. After a 4-week placebo run-in period, patients were randomly assigned to receive active oral, once-daily treatment with amlodipine (5 mg) or with enalapril (5 mg) for 14 weeks. Treatment doses were titrated at weeks 4 and 8 if necessary according to blood pressure (BP) response and if the dose had been tolerated. Patients also underwent 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) at the end of the placebo run-in, after the first and last doses of active treatment, and 48 hours after discontinuation of treatment to determine the duration of drug action and to mimic the effect of 2 missed doses.", 
    "884": "Eighty patients were recruited for the study (26 men, 54 women; mean [SD] age, 60.5 [11.6] years) (40 patients per group). Thirty-seven patients in each group completed the active treatment phase. Baseline trough BPs were similar: 167.7 (15.0)/94.6 (9.7) mm Hg in the amlodipine group and 168.6 (11.9)/93.4 (9.5) mm Hg in the enalapril group. After 14 weeks of treatment, amlodipine (mean [SD] final dose, 6.3 [2.3] mg) produced greater reductions than enalapril (mean [SD] final dose, 13.3 [6.6] mg) in trough BP (-20.8 [13.2]/-9.2 [9.0] vs -5.5 [14.9]/-3.2 [10.6] mm Hg, respectively; P < or = 0.01). Most of the effect of amlodipine persisted for 72 hours after the last dose (-18.9 [14.6]/-11.1 [11.7] mm Hg), but enalapril had no significant antihypertensive effect at 72 hours (-1.3 [12.3]/-1.8 [9.1] mm Hg). Similar observations were found with ABPM recordings. Cough was reported in 5 patients (12.5%) and 13 patients (32.5%) in the amlodipine and enalapril groups, respectively, but was thought to be treatment related in only 6 patients (15.0%), all in the enalapril group. One of the patients in the enalapril group withdrew from the study because of cough, and 1 patient in the amlodipine group withdrew because of ankle edema.", 
    "885": "Black patients who have heart failure (HF) may have a larger proportion of HF with preserved ejection fraction (PEF) than white patients because of the greater prevalence and severity of hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy in blacks. However, studies have not systematically evaluated differences by race in patients who have HF-PEF compared with those who have systolic HF (SHF). Therefore, we examined baseline characteristics and long-term outcomes in patients who had HF-PEF compared with those who had SHF, with an emphasis on variation by race, in a biracial cohort of patients treated within the Veterans Health Administration health care system. In a cohort of 448 patients (192 blacks and 256 whites) hospitalized with HF, 27% had HF-PEF. The proportion of HF-PEF was similar in black (25%) and white (29%) patients (p = 0.4). Among patients who had SHF, black patients were younger, had lower prevalences of atrial fibrillation and diabetes, and had less co-morbidities than white patients, whereas there were no significant differences in these variables by race in patients who had HF-PEF. However, among patients who had SHF or HF-PEF, blacks had a lower prevalence of coronary disease, higher systolic and diastolic blood pressures, and higher serum levels of creatinine than white patients. In addition, mortality and readmission rates for HF did not differ by race among patients who had HF-PEF. Overall, patients who had HF-PEF had a high morbidity rate (30% patients were readmitted for HF in </=6 months) and a high mortality rate (44% at 3 years), despite the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors by 66% of patients at discharge. This underscores the importance of evaluating other agents for the treatment of patients who have HF-PEF.", 
    "886": "Statins have anti-inflammatory effects, modify endothelial function and improve peripheral insulin resistance. We hypothesized that statins influence the development of new-onset diabetes mellitus in renal transplant recipients. The records of all previously non-diabetic adults who received an allograft in Toronto between January 1, 1999 and December 31, 2001 were reviewed with follow-up through December 31, 2002. All patients receiving cyclosporine or tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and prednisone were included. New-onset diabetes was diagnosed by the Canadian Diabetic Association criteria: fasting plasma glucose > or =7.0 mmol/L or 2-h postprandial glucose > or =11.1 mmol/L on more than two occasions. Statin use prior to diabetes development was recorded along with other variables. Cox proportional hazards models analyzing statin use as a time-dependent covariate were performed. Three hundred fourteen recipients met study criteria, of whom 129 received statins. New-onset diabetes incidence was 16% (n = 49). Statins (p = 0.0004, HR 0.238[0.109-0.524]) and ACE inhibitors/ARB (p = 0.01, HR 0.309[0.127-0.750]) were associated with decreased risk. Prednisone dose (p = 0.0001, HR 1.007[1.003-1.010] per 1 mg/d at 3 months), weight at transplant (p = 0.02, HR 1.022[1.003-1.042] per 1 kg), black ethnicity (p = 0.02, HR 1.230[1.023-1.480]) and age > or =45 years (p = 0.01, HR 2.226[1.162-4.261]) were associated with increased diabetes.

    "887": "The effects of 1 nM ouabain (OUA) on the contractile actions of phenylephrine (PHE, 0.001-100 microg) and functional activity of the sodium pump (NKA) in isolated-perfused tail vascular beds from WKY and SHR were investigated. In preparations from SHR, perfusion with OUA in the presence of endothelium (E+) increased the sensitivity (pED50) of PHE (before: 2.14 +/- 0.06 versus after: 2.47 +/- 0.07; P < 0.05) without altering the maximal response (Emax). After endothelial damage, OUA reduced the Emax of PHE in SHR (before: 350 +/- 29 versus after: 293 +/- 25 mm Hg; P < 0.05). In SHR/E+, pretreatment with losartan (10 microM) or enalaprilat (1 microM) prevented the increased sensitivity to PHE induced by OUA. OUA increased NKA activity in SHR/E+ (before: 45 +/- 6 versus after: 58 +/- 5%, P < 0.05). Losartan (10 mg/Kg, i.v.) also abolished the increment in systolic and diastolic blood pressure induced by OUA (0.18 microg/Kg, i.v.) in anesthetized SHR. OUA did not alter the actions of PHE in either anesthetized WKY rats or vascular preparations. Results suggest that 1 nM OUA increased the vascular reactivity to PHE only in SHR/E+. This effect is mediated by OUA-induced activation of endothelial angiotensin converting enzyme that promotes the local formation of angiotensin II, which sensitizes the vascular smooth muscle to the actions of PHE."
