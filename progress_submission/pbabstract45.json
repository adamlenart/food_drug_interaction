Oropharyngeal aspiration is an important etiologic factor leading to pneumonia in the elderly. The incidence of cerebrovascular and degenerative neurologic diseases increase with aging, and these disorders are associated with dysphagia and an impaired cough reflex with the increased likelihood of oropharyngeal aspiration. Elderly patients with clinical signs suggestive of dysphagia and/or who have CAP should be referred for a swallow evaluation. Patients with dysphagia require a multidisciplinary approach to swallowing management. This may include swallow therapy, dietary modification, aggressive oral care, and consideration for treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor.",

This study tested the role of angiotensin II (Ang II) by clamping it chronically at baseline levels. The clamp consisted of an intravenous infusion of enalapril (10 mg/kg/d), which decreased mean arterial pressure (MAP) by approximately 20 mm Hg after 3 days, and adding chronic Ang II at 4 ng/kg/min, which restored MAP to normal. Chronic L-NAME infusion increased MAP to 127 +/- 1 and 132 +/- 2 mm Hg in normal and clamped rats, respectively, and induction of diabetes (streptozotocin) increased MAP progressively in normal rats to 161 +/- 8 mm Hg by day 12, whereas MAP in the clamped rats decreased progressively to 98 +/- 5 mm Hg by day 12. In non-L-NAME rats, MAP averaged 95 +/- 1 and 91 +/- 1 mm Hg for normal and clamped groups, respectively, before diabetes, and MAP was 10 to 13 mm Hg lower in the clamped versus normal rats midway through the diabetic period. This suggests that Ang II is important for maintaining blood pressure at the onset of diabetes, possibly to compensate for renal volume losses. Angiotensin II also is required for the hypertension caused by induction of diabetes in rats with chronic blockade of nitric oxide synthesis, but whether this is due to increased volume sensitivity in L-NAME-treated, vasoconstricted rats remains to be determined.", 
    "21": "Inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) act by blocking the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, which is catalysed by this enzyme. ACE inhibitors also prevent the breakdown of bradykinin, a potent vasodepressor agent, and prevent the effects of angiotensin II, which include increase in blood pressure, peripheral vasoconstriction, and stimulation of aldosterone secretion from the adrenal cortex. Physiological and pathological studies have shown that ACE inhibitors have beneficial effects, such as increasing vascular compliance, regression of periarteriolar collagen area, improvement of coronary reserve, and regression of resistance-artery structure and left-ventricular hypertrophy. Information about the role of ACE inhibitors in stroke prevention has been limited. This review explores the epidemiological evidence for hypertension as a risk factor for stroke, a national guideline for blood-pressure control to reduce the incidence of stroke and cardiovascular disease, the findings of two recently published clinical trials on prevention of stroke and cardiovascular disease after administration of ACE inhibitors (PROGRESS and HOPE), and the implications of the findings for redefinition of future management of blood-pressure control for individuals at high risk of stroke and cardiovascular disease.

However, controversy exists about their efficacy on patients with small infarcts and preserved LV systolic function. The aim of the present study was to detect the influence of the ACE-I perindopril on the global LV performance in patients with pure inferior AMI (AMI-I) using a Doppler-derived index (DI) that combines systolic and diastolic time intervals (Tei index). Our study included 40 patients with first AMI-I, mean age 60 years +/- 9.06 years (SD) and 24 age- and gender-matched normal patients who constituted the control group (COG). Patients were randomized into two groups to receive the conventional treatment of AMI-I (GCT) or the above therapy plus P (GP). Complete Doppler echocardiography (systolic and diastolic parameters), DI, and systolic blood pressure (SBP) were measured on the 8.07 +/- 1.16(SD) post-infarct day.

The DI was significantly lower in healthy patients(0.45 +/- 0.23)compared with the value in patients of either GP(0.56 +/- 0.03; P = 0.023)or GCT(0.78 +/- 0.05; P = 0.000). Moreover DI was higher in patients of GCT compared with that of GP(P = 0.000). In addition, perindopril administration decreased isovolumic relaxation time(IRT; 120.00 +/- 4.23 vs. 139.00 +/- 6.74; P = 0.006)and increased significantly ejection time (ET;274.25 +/- 7.35 vs. 253.50 +/- 7.68; P = 0.042).

LV mass index decreased progressively until at 5-year follow-up the reduction had reached 39% (P < 0.001), after which neither LV mass nor any other structural parameter underwent any further significant change. During this time, QT dispersion (DeltaQT) and the dispersion of \"corrected\" QT (DeltaQTc) decreased significantly: DeltaQT (from 61 +/- 21 to 37 +/- 13 ms) and DeltaQTc (from 67 +/- 27 to 41 +/- 16 ms). After suspension of treatment for 8 weeks following 5-year follow-up, DeltaQT was 40 +/- 14 ms and DeltaQTc was 44 +/- 17 ms; there were no significant changes either in DeltaQT and DeltaQTc or LV hypertrophy although BP had returned to pretreatment values (BP: 150 +/- 16; 101 +/- 10 mmHg).",

Atorvastatin alone or in combination partially prevented the increase in cholesterol plasma levels observed in rabbits fed with the cholesterol-rich diet, but did not modify blood pressure levels. Quinapril administration did not alter any of these parameters in any group. Hypercholesterolaemia increased plasma levels of interleukin-1beta, interleukin-6, interferon-gamma and C-reactive protein, reduced acetylcholine-induced relaxation and produced intimal thickening. Likewise, atherosclerotic rabbits had reduced plasma tissue-type plasminogen activator activity and D-dimer levels and an increase in plasminogen-activator inhibitor-1 activity. Both drugs enhanced acetylcholine-induced relaxation, reduced intimal thickening and improved fibrinolytic balance in atherosclerotic rabbits in a similar manner. Their combination did not induce additive effects on these parameters. However, only the combination of both drugs was able to prevent the increase in inflammatory markers induced by hypercholesterolaemia. In summary, these data suggest that quinapril and atorvastatin had comparable beneficial effects on the alterations of vascular function and structure as well as fibrinolytic balance in atherosclerotic rabbits. In addition, the combination of atorvastatin and quinapril exerts a synergistic effect on inflammatory markers, which individual treatment, at the doses used, was not able to modify.", 
    "33": "The objective of this study was to characterize the changes in peptide solubility resulting from changing some physicochemical conditions in a tryptic hydrolysate of beta-lactoglobulin (beta-LG). The turbidity (500 nm) of a 1% solution of tryptic peptides was measured at pH 3-10, at 5, 25, and 50 degrees C, in the presence of different salt concentrations (0, 0.5, and 1 M NaCl), in the presence of denaturing and reducing agents (6 M urea, 5% SDS, or 5% beta-mercaptoethanol), and under an electric field (isoelectric focusing). The results reveal an increase in turbidity of the peptide solution at pH 4, but a slight increase in turbidity was also observed at pH 8, which is attributable to peptides linked by disulfide bridges. The effect of temperature and ionic strength on the turbidity occurring at pH 4 indicates that mainly hydrophobic interactions are involved in the aggregation process. The material in the precipitate at pH 4 was identified as the peptides beta-LG 1-8, 15-20, and 41-60 and non-hydrolyzed alpha-lactalbumin. These results suggest that a limited number of peptides are involved in the aggregation process observed at pH 4, some of which having bioactive (beta-LG 15-20, ACE inhibitor, and opioid) or emulsifying properties (beta-LG 41-60). Aggregation of these peptides at acidic pH indicates that a simple acidification step could represent an easy process for isolating peptidic fractions enriched in bioactive or functional peptides.",

The conditions selected were as follows: 10 mM HHL concentration in 0.2 M potassium phosphate buffer and 0.3 M NaCl and 26 mU of ACE/mL as reaction medium; incubation time, 80 min at 37 degrees C. The method was applied to the study of ACE-inhibitory activity of dairy product and wine samples. Of the samples assayed, it was infant formulae whey that produces the greatest ACE inhibition. Red wine also presents a high inhibition percentage. This latter sample has an important matrix effect that must be corrected in the calculation. ACE-inhibition type was also studied, using a yogurt whey and a Captropil solution as substrates. The whey produced noncompetitive inhibition and the Captropil competitive inhibition.", 
    "35": "Hypertension is twice as common in patients with diabetes compared to those without diabetes. It accounts for up to 75% of cardiovascular disease risk leading to the substantial increase in morbidity and mortality. Control of blood pressure in people with diabetes has been shown in randomized controlled trials to decrease cardiovascular risk and improve outcome especially in preventing stroke. A target blood pressure goal of <130/80 mm Hg is currently recommended for patients with diabetes. However, less than 1/3 of these patients achieve such a goal. This is in part due to the inherent difficulty in controlling blood pressure in these patients where hypertension is usually associated with increased salt sensitivity, volume expansion and isolated systolic hypertension. Therefore, patients with diabetes usually require multiple medications for optimal blood pressure control. Calcium channel antagonists have been shown in large clinical trials to be both safe and effective in controlling blood pressure in diabetic patients and will continue to play a major role in the management of hypertension in this population, particularly in the combination therapy that these patients usually require.", 
    "36": "Stroke is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Those who survive have a one in six chance of a further stroke in the ensuing five years. The perindopril protection against recurrent stroke study (PROGRESS) is the first specific trial to address whether blood pressure lowering in hypertensive or non-hypertensive patients with a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) would reduce subsequent cerebrovascular and cardiovascular events. Results show that treatment based on perindopril significantly reduces stroke (28%), cardiovascular events (26%) and heart failure (26%). Stable patients post stroke should be considered for perindopril, and indapamide if possible, along with other evidence based risk reduction treatments (e.g. aspirin, statins). Therapy can be initiated and monitored either from hospital outpatients or general practice or both in co-operation.", 
    "37": "Omapatrilat is the most clinically advanced member of a new class of cardiovascular agents known as vasopeptidase inhibitors. Omapatrilat acts by inhibiting two key enzymes responsible for blood pressure regulation: neutral endopeptidase and angiotensin-converting enzyme. Omapatrilat provides dose-related reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure with an excellent trough-to-peak ratio after once-daily administration. The reduction in blood pressure is proportional to baseline blood pressure. Used in monotherapy, omapatrilat controls hypertension in more than 65% of patients treated and reduces blood pressure to a greater extent than existing agents. Furthermore, omapatrilat exhibits an excellent tolerability profile. Therefore, this drug represents an important new approach for treating a wide range of patients, including those who are difficult to control, such as elderly patients with isolated systolic hypertension and patients with diabetes. The results of early clinical trials in patients with congestive heart failure have shown that omapatrilat not only improves symptoms but also reduces the risk of and hospitalization and death when compared with ACE inhibitors alone. These results indicate that vasopeptidase inhibition is a promising new strategy in the treatment of hypertension and cardiac diseases.", 
    "38": "The existence of tubulointerstitial damage in most cases of progressive human glomerular disease suggests that this compartment of the kidney is likely to be targeted by renoprotective agents which slow the progression of disease. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have become the cornerstone of renal protection. Since we have proposed that perturbation of the interstitial capillary circulation with consequent chronic hypoxia could be critical to the progressive nature of many renal diseases, we developed a dynamic method of measuring renal cortical pO(2) and sought to determine whether agents which block the renal effects of angiotensin II (AII) could affect interstitial microvascular oxygenation in the normal rat kidney.", 
    "39": "Instrumented, anaesthetised adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were studied. Cortical microvascular pO(2 )was measured on the surface of the exposed kidney using protoporphyrin phosphorescence. Blood pressure and renal artery blood flow (Doppler flowmetry) were measured concurrently over a 180-min experimental period. Animals received non-hypotensive doses of enalaprilat (100 microg/kg i.v.) or candesartan (40 microg/kg i.v.) either at the beginning of the experimental period or after an initial decline in cortical microvascular pO(2).", 
    "40": "After a 30-min stabilisation period there was a slow decline in pO(2 )from 48.6 +/- 4.1 to 38.5 +/- 6.9 mm Hg in control animals over the 180-min experimental period. Administration of the ACE inhibitor, enalaprilat at the beginning of the experimental period, completely abrogated this decline and protected pO(2) levels throughout this period with no effect on blood pressure or renal blood flow. In separate experiments, administration of enalaprilat after microvascular pO(2) had fallen by 5 mm Hg, resulted in a rise in RBF and pO(2 )within 15 min with pO(2) remaining elevated for up to 60 min post-injection. The angiotensin II AT(1) receptor antagonist, candesartan, had a similar effect to enalaprilat, inducing a rapid and sustained elevation in cortical pO(2).", 
    "41": "These studies indicate that blockade of AII raises pO(2 )in the interstitial microvascular compartment of the normal rat kidney. This effect may contribute to the renoprotective action of ACE inhibitors and AII receptor antagonists in slowing the progression of chronic renal diseases.", 
    "42": "Omapatrilat belongs to the vasopeptidase inhibitors, ie, drugs that possess the ability to inhibit simultaneously the membrane-bound zinc metalloproteases, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), and the neutral endopeptidase EC 3.4.24.11 (NEP). Omapatrilat was targeted to treat patients with hypertension and congestive heart failure. The preclinical and early clinical studies conducted with omapatrilat were very promising. Indeed, omapatrilat appeared to be a very potent antihypertensive agent with very favorable effects on cardiac function in heart failure patients. In contrast to these early studies, the large clinical trials were more disappointing. The results of the OCTAVE trial confirmed the antihypertensive efficacy of omapatrilat, but at the price of an angioedema rate more than threefold higher than that of an ACE inhibitor in the overall population (2.17% vs 0.68%), and close to fourfold higher in the black population. In OVERTURE, a large randomized control trial in heart failure, angioedema was also more common with omapatrilat, but the incidence was much lower (0.8% with omapatrilat vs 0.5% with enalapril). However, omapatrilat was not convincingly superior to the ACE inhibitor. Because angioedema is probably a class side effect of vasopeptidase inhibitors, the higher incidence of this potentially life-threatening complication with omapatrilat has likely stopped the development of this new class of agents. The future of vasopeptidase inhibitors will depend on the ability to improve the risk/benefit ratio either by developing agents that produce less angioedema, or by defining more precisely a high-risk population that could take advantage of dual ACE/NEP inhibition.", 
    "43": "Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), like angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, are commonly used in the setting of chronic kidney disease. The use of drugs in this class, or for that matter any drug in the renally compromised patient, should raise consideration of the impact of renal disease on the systemic elimination of the compound. Unlike most of the drugs in the ACE inhibitor class, the compounds making up the ARB class undergo significant hepatic elimination; thus, in the renal failure patient, they are not prone to relevant degrees of systemic accumulation with repetitive dosing. ARBs do not require dose adjustment in renal failure on the basis of their pharmacokinetic pattern; rather, dose reduction should be an empiric process dictated by having reached or exceeded the goal established for blood pressure reduction.", 
    "44": "There is incontrovertible evidence that association of type 2 diabetes with hypertension markedly increases the risk of cardiovascular events, death, and nephropathy. In type 2 diabetes, even blood pressure values usually considered below the threshold for hypertension (ie, 140/90 mm Hg) in nondiabetic subjects represent an additional risk of clinical relevance. Evidence that more intensive blood pressure lowering is beneficial in type 2 diabetes over less intensive lowering is also overwhelming. However, most published trials show the need for combination therapy in the great majority of patients, and even with combination therapy it is difficult to attain the expected goal blood pressure, in particular goal systolic blood pressure. It should be recognized that the systolic blood pressure goal of less than 130 mm Hg is a very difficult one to achieve in diabetics. Evidence of the superiority or inferiority of different drug classes is vague and contradictory. Recent evidence concerning angiotensin II receptor antagonists has shown a significant reduction of cardiovascular events, cardiovascular death, and total mortality when losartan was compared with atenolol, but not when irbesartan was compared with amlodipine. If renal endpoints are considered, evidence of the benefit of angiotensin II receptor antagonists in type 2 diabetes is more robust than that available with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Primary prevention of development of microalbuminuria seems to be greatly facilitated by strict blood pressure control. However, by attaining normal blood pressure levels (< 130/80 mm Hg), better preservation of glomerular filtration rate does not seem to be insured.", 
    "45": "The simultaneous occurrence of essential hypertension and diabetes mellitus is exceedingly common. In recent years the treatment of the cardiovascular and renal complications has not only become more specific but more effective. The evidence-based medicine data have been provided through many large multicenter studies and strongly support the promise not only of effective treatment in retarding the progression of target-organ involvement, but also the potential of reversal. These dramatic therapeutic improvements have been made possible by wedding the involved pathophysiologic disease mechanisms with the actions of pharmacologic agents. Inherent in this concept is the promise of retarding the development of the cardiovascular and renal morbid events and also reducing their associated mortal endpoints.", 
    "46": "Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in patients with hypertension is associated with an increased risk for many cardiovascular events and predicts a higher mortality rate. The pathogenesis of LVH is complicated. In addition to the hemodynamic burden (pressure or volume overload) and demographic factors, several trophic humoral factors, such as angiotensin II, aldosterone, endothelin, leptin, and catecholamines, may also contribute to the development and progression of LVH. Effective antihypertensive therapy can reverse LVH as well as prevent its development. Regression of LVH decreases subsequent cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The commonly used drugs have various effects on LVH. Angiotensin receptor blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors seem most effective. Several new agents, including direct antifibrotic drugs, aldosterone blockade, vasopeptidase inhibitors, and endothelin receptor antagonists that more specifically target the underlying pathogenesis of LVH may provide us with innovative approaches to treat LVH.", 
    "47": "Several large, prospective, randomized, clinical outcome trials have shown that calcium channel blockers are effective and safe antihypertensive drugs compared with placebo and reduce the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality of treated patients. In other studies, when compared with conventional antihypertensive drugs, they demonstrated similar blood pressure-lowering effects and similar reductions in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, with the exception of a higher incidence of heart failure and fatal myocardial infarction in some studies. However, considering all the evidence available today, these drugs should be considered safe for the treatment of the uncomplicated hypertensive patient in combination with other drugs. They can also be used as first-line therapy for older, stroke-prone hypertensive patients. In addition, when a calcium channel blocker is indicated for better blood pressure control, its use should not be withheld for safety concerns.", 
    "48": "Urticaria is a classic cutaneous manifestation of drug allergy considered like the second most frequent drug eruption after maculopapular exanthemas. Most of the time drugs are responsible of acute urticaria lasting less than 24 hours. The mechanisms of these acute urticarial reactions are multiple, mostly related to an IgE-induced reaction. Nevertheless, some drugs can induce immune complexes and activate the complement cascade (sickness disease). Others may directly release mast cells mediators or activate complement by non immunologic mechanisms in the absence of antibody. In every case, these drugs are unable to generate urticaria during more than 6 weeks, time allowed for calling a chronic urticaria. However drugs like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and acetysalicylic acid can, by a pharmacologic mechanism, exacerbate or trigger chronic urticaria. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, by a defect of degradation of bradykinin, may also induced angioedemas. In this context, if an allergologic investigation is useful in the exploration of acute urticaria, it seems useless for chronic urticaria.",

Several pharmacological approaches to reduce restenosis have been evaluated but to date none have been approved for this indication. Angiotensin II has been implicated in the development of restenosis through several physiologic mechanisms, and thus control of the renin-angiotensin system may be a potential target for its prevention. Although human trials have shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors do not reduce the risk of restenosis, early data suggest that the selective AT(1) angiotensin receptor blocker valsartan may be effective in preventing in-stent restenosis in patients with complex lesions.",

Two ACE inhibitors were isolated to homogeneity from the extract by adsorption and gel filtration column chromatography, and by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The purified substances reacted with 2,4,6-trinitrobenzensulfonic acid sodium salt. The amino acid sequences of these inhibitors determined by Edman degradation were Ile-Phe-Leu (IC(50), 44.8 microM) and Trp-Leu (IC(50), 29.9 microM). The Ile-Phe-Leu sequence is found in the alpha- and beta-subunits of beta-conglycinin, while the Trp-Leu sequence is in the B-, B1A- and BX-subunits of glycinin from soybean. Both of the peptides are non-competitive inhibitors. The inhibitory activity of Trp-Leu was completely preserved after a treatment with pepsin, chymotrypsin or trypsin. Even after successive digestion by these gastrointestinal proteases, the activity remained at 29% of the original value.", 
    "54": "To assess effects of dietary salt on brain AT1 receptor densities, 4-wk-old Dahl salt-sensitive (Dahl S) and salt-resistant (Dahl R) rats were fed a regular (101 mumol Na/g) or high (1,370 mumol Na/g)-salt diet for 1, 2, or 4 wk. AT1 receptors were assessed by quantitative in vitro autoradiography. AT1 receptor densities did not differ significantly between strains on the regular salt diet. The high-salt diet for 1 or 2 wk increased AT1 receptor binding by 21-64% in the Dahl S rats in the subfornical organ, median preoptic nucleus, paraventricular nucleus, and suprachiasmatic nucleus. No changes were noted in the Dahl R rats. After 4 wk on a high-salt diet, increases in AT1 receptor binding persisted in Dahl S rats but were now also noted in the paraventricular nucleus, median preoptic nucleus, and suprachiasmatic nucleus of Dahl R rats. At 4 wk on the diet, intracerebroventricular captopril caused clear decreases in blood pressure only in the Dahl S on the high-salt diet but caused largely similar relative increases in brain AT1 receptor densities in Dahl S and R on the high-salt diet versus regular salt diet. These data demonstrate that high salt intake rapidly (within 1 wk) increases AT1 receptor densities in specific brain nuclei in Dahl S and later (by 4 wk) also in Dahl R rats. Because the brain renin-angiotensin system only contributes to salt-induced hypertension in Dahl S rats, further studies are needed to determine which of the salt-induced increases in brain AT1 receptor densities contribute to the hypertension and which to other aspects of body homeostasis.",

There are limitations to the methods available to risk-stratify patients, and the optimal treatment strategy remains unclear. The benefits of lifestyle modification cannot be over-emphasised, and appropriate attention to modifiable risk factors is paramount. The mortality benefit of lipid lowering treatment and antiplatelet therapy is well proved. However the evidence base for anti-ischaemic therapy is less rigorous, being based mainly on extrapolations from studies of acute coronary syndromes. Angioplasty has been shown to be more effective in relief of symptoms than medical therapy alone, but provides no mortality benefit. Coronary artery bypass surgery, however, has been shown to reduce mortality in patients with severe proximal coronary disease when compared with medical management alone.",

Because Ang I and converting enzyme analogues might be present in the distal nephron, this raises the possibility of intraluminal generation of Ang II. Conversion of Ang I to Ang II was monitored by Ang II-dependent changes in intracellular sodium concentration as a reflection of sodium transport across the apical membrane. This involved imaging-based fluorescence microscopy with sodium-binding benzofuran isophthalate in isolated, perfused, cortical collecting-duct segments from rabbit kidney. Principal and intercalated cells were differentiated by rhodamine-conjugated peanut lectin. Control principal cell intracellular sodium concentration, during perfusion with 25 mmol/L NaCl and zero sodium in the bath plus monensin (10(-5) mol/L) averaged 5.8+/-0.14 mmol/L (n=156). The increase in intracellular sodium concentration, when luminal NaCl was increased from 25 to 150 mmol/L, was elevated by 3.5-fold in the presence of intraluminal Ang I (10(-6) mol/L). Also, the effects of Ang I on sodium transport were not significantly different from the effects of Ang II (10(-9) mol/L). Ang I was used in micromolar concentrations to ensure that there was sufficient substrate available for conversion to Ang II. Inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme with captopril reduced the stimulatory effect of Ang I. These results suggest that intraluminal conversion of Ang I to Ang II can occur in the cortical collecting duct, resulting in enhanced apical sodium entry.",

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors should remain first-line treatment with angiotensin receptor blockers used in ACE inhibitor-intolerant patients. Many new neurohormonal antagonists have recently been investigated and eplerenone has demonstrated clinical benefit. New hormonal, anticytokine, and anti-inflammatory therapies have shown benefit in small trials, but results in larger trials have been disappointing.

The influence from the blood pressure (BP) - reducing effect in some studies might also contribute to this inconclusiveness. To examine the possibility of the benefit being different according to underlying renal diseases, we undertook a crossover therapeutic trial of the combination therapy in two selected homogenous groups of patients with diabetic and non-diabetic renal diseases. The BP-reducing effect was excluded during the study. Nineteen biopsy-proven IgA nephropathy, as examples of non-diabetic renal diseases, and 24 type 2 diabetic nephropathy patients were selected as the study subjects. The subjects had to meet the follow criteria: a creatinine clearance (Ccr) between 25 - 90 ml/min/1.73 m2, 24-hr urinary protein excretion rate over 1.0 g/day and a BP maintained at less than 130/80 mmHg, with more than six-month therapy of ramipril, (5.7 +/- 0.4 mg/day, 13 +/- 2 month). The baseline data between the two groups showed no significantly differences. After a 12-week stabilization period (control period), 4 mg, once daily, dose of candesartan (combination period) followed by a placebo (placebo period), or vice versa, were administered in addition to the ramipril, for 12 weeks. The combination, with candesartan, did not change the Ccr, BP, serum and urinary electrolytes or the urea. The 24 hour urinary protein excretion rate was significantly reduced by the combination therapy in the patients with IgA nephropathy (3.1 +/- 0.3 g/day in combination, 4.2 +/- 0.3 in control, and 4.3 +/- 0.2 in placebo; p < 0.05). However, the patients with diabetic nephropathy showed no reduction in their proteinuria with the combination therapy (3.8 +/- 0.2 g/day in combination, 3.9 +/- 0.3 in control, and 4.1 +/- 0.3 in placebo; p=NS). The changes in proteinuria showed no relationship with the changes in the BP in IgA nephropathy. In conclusions, the benefit of combination therapy of its antiproteinuric effect was different between IgA and diabetic nephropathy over the 12-week trial. The difference in the pathophysiological role, and the importance of the renin- angiotensin system, between the two diseases might contribute to the discrepancy in the result. We suggest the discrimination of the underlying renal diseases in the study subjects is an important prerequisite for future studies on this issue.",

    "108": "Graft vasculopathy is an accelerated form of coronary artery disease that occurs in transplanted hearts. Despite major advances in immunosuppression, the prevalence of the disease has remained substantially unchanged during the last two decades. According to the 'response to injury' paradigm, graft vasculopathy is the result of a continuous inflammatory response to tissue injury initiated by both alloantigen-dependent and independent stress responses. Experimental evidence suggests that these responses may become self-sustaining, as allograft re-transplantation into the donor strain at a later stage fails to prevent disease progression. Histological evidence of endothelitis and arteritis, in association with intima fibrosis and atherosclerosis, reflects the central role of alloimmunity and inflammation in the development of arterial lesions. Experimental results in gene-targeted mouse models indicate that cellular and humoral immune responses are both involved in the pathogenesis of graft vasculopathy. Circulating antibodies against donor endothelium are found in a significant number of patients, but their pathogenic role is still controversial. Alloantigen-independent factors include donor-transmitted coronary artery disease, surgical trauma, ischaemia-reperfusion injury, viral infections, hyperlipidaemia, hypertension, and glucose intolerance. Recent therapeutic advances include the use of novel immunosuppressive agents such as sirolimus (rapamycin), HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Optimal treatment of cardiovascular risk factors remains of paramount importance.",

Activation of the cardiac Na(+)-H(+) exchanger 1 (NHE1) during ischaemia induces arrhythmias, myocardial stunning and irreversible cell injury. As the benefits of NHE1 inhibitors (e.g., amiloride, cariporide) in models of myocardial infarction are usually much greater when used as pretreatment, rather than during or after ischaemia, it is probably not surprising that clinical trials with cariporide in ischaemia have shown little shortterm benefit. NHE1 inhibitors have been shown to be beneficial in animal models of ventricular fibrillation and resuscitation, cardioplegia, hypertrophy and heart failure, and their therapeutic potential in these conditions should be further developed. The Na(+)-HCO(3)(-) cotransporter (NBC) is also stimulated by intracellular acidification, and part of the benefit of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors after myocardial infarction may be due to inhibition of the NBC. Selective inhibitors of the NBC are required to determine the therapeutic potential of this mechanism. The Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX) has a major role in cardiac Na(+) and Ca(2+) homeostasis and influences cardiac electrical activity. The NCX also has a role in ischaemia/infarction, arrhythmias, hypertrophy and heart failure.

    "132": "Numerous recent investigations on the development and morphology of atherosclerotic lesions have shown programmed cell death or apoptosis to be an important factor in atherogenesis. Enzymes known as caspases are essential for completion of the apoptotic program. With regard to the origin of signals inducing apoptosis, there are two ways of initiating caspase activation: (a) cellular death receptor-mediated activation; and (b) activation mediated by mitochondrial permeability and expression of the p53 oncogene. Both of these pathways are involved in atherogenesis. Oxidative stress, angiotensin II and cholesterol overload are the primary factors that induce apoptosis in vascular cells. Considering apoptosis in endothelial cells, exposed phosphatidylserine on the cell membrane activates thrombin increasing the probability of arterial thromboses. Further progression of atherosclerosis is promoted by the formation of apoptotic bodies with oxidized phospholipids exposed on the membrane; these also activate adhesion of monocytes. Apoptosis of smooth muscle cells is usually observed in the fibrous portion of an atherosclerotic plaque in which the cells produce collagen important for plaque stability. As apoptosis occurs in smooth muscle cells, the fibrous cap grows thinner. This can result in both plaque rupture, formation of thrombi as well as calcification of the plaque from apoptotic smooth muscle cells remnants. Smooth muscle cells apoptosis is beneficial in that it offers protection to the walls of arteries against proliferative restenosis induced by invasive procedures. Apoptosis of macrophages contributes to the formation and progression of the lipidic core and promotes thrombosis of atherosclerosis in damaged arteries. By contrast, apoptosis of macrophages diminishes the production of matrix methaloproteinases that decompose collagen fibers. New facts concerning the effects of antioxidants (selenium, vitamin C and vitamin E), inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme, beta-blockers, calcium chanel blockers, and statins are also considered in this review.", 
    "133": "In patients with diabetes, altered diurnal blood pressure (BP) regulation (high night-to-day [N/D] ratio, or \"nondipping\") is associated with increases in albumin excretion and a decline in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by an unknown mechanism. Because it is known that renin angiotensin system (RAS) activation and defective glucose control contribute to adverse renal outcomes, we examined renal responses to high glucose and to manipulation of the RAS in adolescents (mean age 14 +/- 2 years) with uncomplicated type 1 diabetes, segregated into two groups on the basis of the presence or absence of normal N/D BP ratio. In the first experiment, renal hemodynamic comparisons were made during euglycemia (4-6 mmol/l) and hyperglycemia (9-11 mmol/l), maintained by modified clamp techniques. The induction of hyperglycemia resulted in a significant increase in GFR and filtration fraction (FF) in the high N/D ratio group. In the second experiment, we examined the renal response to graded angiotensin II (Ang II) infusion while subjects were euglycemic and salt replete. High N/D ratio was associated with an enhanced FF response to Ang II. In the third experiment, the N/D ratio and GFR were assessed after 3 weeks of ACE inhibition. This maneuver corrected the high N/D ratio, but it had no effect on glomerular hyperfiltration. These results suggest that RAS activation does not explain the hyperfiltration state, nor can it explain the poor outcomes, at least in this population. However, the observed deleterious hemodynamic responses to high glucose and Ang II and the insensitivity to ACE inhibition may, taken together, provide an explanation for the adverse renal outcomes in patients with type 1 diabetes and high N/D ratio.",

Poor glycemic control a significant changes of erythrocyte membrane fluidity, erythrocyte deformability and antioxidant status. Nonenzymatic glycation and glycoxidation with cascade of free radical reactions, oxidative and carbonyl stress may play an important role in the development diabetic micro- and macrovascular complications. The serum levels of specific and nonspecific advanced glycation end products (s-AGEs) have been found elevated in type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients. Levels of s-AGEs. may serve as useful biochemical marker for monitoring progression of diabetic complications and pathological processes. Accumulation of AGEs on tissue proteins increases with pathogenesis of diabetic complications and atherosclerosis. AGEs are believed to induce cellular oxidative stress through the interaction with specific cellular receptors. Carbonyl stress-induced tissue damage is caused by AGE precursors formed by hyperglycaemia, hyperlipidemia, nonenzymatic glycation, peroxidation of lipids and metabolis processes. The toxic effects of AGE precursors can not be directly antagonized by antioxidants. Only a small number of biological carbonyl scavengers like glutathione have been identified to date. For therapeutic intervention, nucleophilic compounds as aminoguanidine, pyridoxamine, OPB-9195, 2,3-diaminophenazone, carnosine and tenilsetam give promising results. These potential therapeutics have been proposed to trap AGE precursors. Studies in vitro showed that these AGE inhibitors have also the antioxidant and chelating activity. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and angiotensin II receptor antagonists also significantly attenuate AGE production. These drugs do not trap AGE precursors, but impact on the production of AGE precursors by chelating transition metals and inhibiting various oxidative steps in the process of glycoxidation, including the formation of free radicals.

Four groups of uninephrectomized streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats were assigned to receive orally vehicle, bosentan, enalapril, or their combination. A fifth group consisted of nondiabetic, uninephrectomized rats. At 2 weeks, untreated diabetic rats exhibited increased glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow. Bosentan, enalapril, and the combination all prevented hyperfiltration and hyperperfusion. By 5 months, diabetic rats developed marked increases in mean arterial pressure and renal vascular resistance, progressive proteinuria, and renal structural damage with glomerular sclerosis and hypertrophy. Bosentan completely prevented the development of hypertension and renal vasoconstriction, and largely prevented the development of proteinuria and renal structural injury. The renal protective effect of bosentan was comparable to that of enalapril or the combination, although its anti-proteinuric effect was less.

The patients were divided randomly into 3 therapeutic groups; perindopril, candesartan, and control (without perindopril and candesartan) groups, and the drugs were administered within 24 to 36 hours after the onset of acute myocardial infarction. Serum macrophage colony-stimulating factor concentrations in acute myocardial infarction patients at the time of admission were significantly higher than those in healthy control subjects. The macrophage colony-stimulating factor levels in the patients decreased gradually after admission, but remained significantly higher than those in control subjects for 14 days. There were no significant differences in serum macrophage colony-stimulating factor levels among the 3 therapeutic groups during this study period. In conclusion, circulating macrophage colony-stimulating factor levels are elevated during the course of acute myocardial infarction, and inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker does not affect these levels.",

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study had as a primary end point achievement of blood pressure <130/85 mm Hg. Participants (N=214) with hypertension and type 2 diabetes received either amlodipine/benazepril 5/10 mg (combination) or enalapril 10 mg (conventional) once daily for 4 weeks, titrated to 5/20 mg/day or 20 mg/day, respectively at this time, if target blood pressure was not achieved. Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 12.5 mg/day was added for the final 4 weeks, if target blood pressure was still not reached. Time from baseline to achieve blood pressure <130/85 mm Hg was shorter in the combination group (5.3+/-3.1 weeks combination vs. 6.4+/-3.8 weeks conventional; p=0.001). At 3 months, more participants in the combination group achieved treatment goal (63% combination vs. 37% conventional; p=0.002). Data analysis at 3 months comparing blood pressure control rates between the fixed-dose combination group (without HCTZ) to the conventional group (receiving HCTZ) showed an even greater disparity in blood pressure goal achievement (87% combination without HCTZ vs. 37% conventional group with HCTZ; p=0.0001). We conclude that initial therapy with a fixed-dose combination may be more efficacious than conventional monotherapy approaches for achieving blood pressure goals in the diabetic patient. A fixed-dose combination approach appears as safe as the current conventional approaches.", 
    "155": "Recent studies suggest that changes in the periphery, like those occurring in the skeletal muscles of patients with chronic heart failure, might play an important role in the origin of symptoms and exercise intolerance in this condition. Biochemical and histologic changes in the skeletal muscles of chronic heart failure patients relate with the degree of exercise intolerance better than hemodynamics parameters. A reduction in skeletal muscle mass represents another important determinant of exercise intolerance in chronic heart failure patients. The relationship between skeletal muscle changes and exercise intolerance suggests the possibility of modifying the peripheral changes in order to improve functional capacity in chronic heart failure patients. Recent studies have shown that the administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers can improve the properties of the skeletal muscles. Similarly, exercise training allows improvement in peak oxygen consumption, which parallels important biochemical and histologic changes in the skeletal muscles.", 
    "156": "Diabetes mellitus is a risk factor for congestive heart failure. Diabetics with congestive heart failure should have good glycemic control, treatment of hypertension and dyslipidemia, and treatment with diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and beta blockers as well as digoxin, if the left ventricular ejection fraction is abnormal. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may have left ventricular failure because of a coexistent cardiac disorder or right ventricular failure from pulmonary hypertension. An acute respiratory tract infection may precipitate right ventricular failure and should be treated. Alveolar hypoxia should be corrected by improving alveolar ventilation through relieving airflow obstruction with bronchodilators and by increasing inspired oxygen concentration. Loop diuretics should be used cautiously. Beta blockers may be given to patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and left ventricular failure if bronchospasm is not present. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors should be used to treat left ventricular failure. Digitalis should not be used in patients with right ventricular failure due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are contraindicated in patients with congestive heart failure. There are controversial data about the negative interaction between aspirin and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with congestive heart failure. Patients with arthritis and congestive heart failure needing large doses of aspirin for pain relief may be treated instead with acetaminophen, tramadol, or Percocet if necessary for chronic severe pain.",

    "165": "Chronic renal failure is characterized by a persistently abnormal glomerular filtration rate. The rate of progression varies substantially. Several morphologic features are prominent: fibrosis, loss of native renal cells, and infiltration by monocytes and/or macrophages. Mediators of the process include abnormal glomerular hemodynamics, hypoxia, proteinuria, hypertension, and several vasoactive substances (ie, cytokines and growth factors). Several predisposing host factors may also contribute to the process. Treatments to delay progression are aimed at treating the primary disease and at strictly controlling the systemic blood pressure and proteinuria. The role of antihypertensive agents, statins, and use of other maneuvers such as protein restriction and novel approaches are also discussed herein.", 
    "166": "Microalbuminuria and hypertension with Over the past decade, there has been considerable focus on the concept of microalbuminuria, not only because it predicts renal disease in type 1 and type 2 diabetes, but also because it relates to premature mortality in the diabetic and in the general population. More importantly, intervention at this stage is now possible with the perspective of preserving glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and ameliorating cardiovascular disease and ensuing strong end-points. INITIAL STUDIES: The concept of microalbuminuria was introduced about 20 years ago and since then there has been a multitude of studies and papers on this subject using the original definition, but not always, in the US. Before that time it was suggested, mainly from the US, that diabetic renal disease was an untreatable relentlessly progressive condition.", 
    "167": "There is an overwhelming number of studies on genetics and diabetes and also covering the genetics of diabetic complications including nephropathy. However, so far the results are extremely disappointing. Patients at risk cannot be identified and genetic analyses are of no value as a guide to treatment. The notion that the development of complications is controlled mainly by a special genetic pattern is increasingly doubtful. In genetic studies, it is rather phenotypic well-accepted risk factors that dominate. STRUCTURAL BASIS OF MICROALBUMINURIA: Patients with microalbuminuria have significant abnormalities in the kidney, including glomeruli. This is quite clear in patients with type 1 diabetes, but is also seen in type 2 diabetes, where on the other hand, other risk factors such as hypertension and dyslipidaemia also seem to be of importance, including loss of autoregulation. Renal biopsies are generally not indicated in the management of diabetic patients. MICROALBUMINURIA AND EARLY MORTALITY: It is quite clear that microalbuminuria predicts early mortality both in type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The association to other risk factors may partly explain this--but this does not account for the whole picture. Endothelial dysfunction as well as inflammatory and arteriosclerotic abnormalities in blood vessels may be a relevant hypothesis that needs to be further explored along with other possibilities. CLINICAL COURSE AND ASSOCIATED ABNORMALITIES: The risk factor for progression in normoalbuminuric patients to microalbuminuria is higher than normal albumin excretion (strongest factor), poor glycaemic control, elevated blood pressure, and to some extent smoking. The clinical course of microalbuminuria is usually progressive, but with the more effective intervention now available we encounter that the so-called natural history (without intervention) is increasingly difficult to study. Microalbuminuria is clearly associated with a number of abnormalities, almost in all organs, but GFR is generally well preserved in spite of more advanced structural lesions. Therefore, microalbuminuria is an important marker for more pronounced diabetic vascular disease in general as well as for nephropathy. Regression to normoalbuminuria only rarely occurs during standard unchanged nonintensive treatment. TREATMENT STRATEGIES: The best possible glycaemic control is important in preventing and ameliorating the course of normo- and micro-albuminuria. Another major treatment strategy, especially in microalbuminuric patients, is antihypertensive treatment including inhibition of the renal angiotensin aldosterone system. Numerous new studies are available, both in type 1 and type 2 diabetes, documenting that not only microalbuminuria but also renal and cardiovascular complications in these patient are also far better controlled by early detection and treatment. Therefore, screening for microalbuminuria should be a strategy in all diabetes management followed by effective intervention as outlined in this paper.", 
    "168": "The blockade of the renin-angiotensin system in the heart failure using ACE inhibitors, based on numerous clinical studies, demonstrated significant decrease in morbidity and mortality in the patients. Discovery of angiotensin II receptor antagonists brought about a new possibility of blockade of the rennin-angiotensin system. The blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with angiotensin II receptor antagonists should have been more effective and comprehensive than that induced by ACE inhibitors. However, the first studies with angiotensin II receptor antagonists in heart failure did not confirm that the antagonists are superior in reducing mortality and hospitalization in patients with heart failure when compared with ACE inhibitors. For the time being, the ACE inhibitors remain the current therapy of choice in treating heart failure. Angiotensin II receptor antagonists are a reasonable alternative in patients who cannot be treated with ACE inhibitors because of adverse effects. Clinical studies currently under way with angiotensin II receptor antagonists may alter these conclusions.", 
    "169": "As Westernised societies have become more affluent, the attitudes of the population have become more risk-aware. People are now intolerant of small risks as well as the physical or mental discomforts from drug side effects. Safety and tolerability are now major forces driving the development of new medicines for the treatment of chronic illnesses and the prevention of increasingly rare events. For example, over the past decades, lower and lower treatment thresholds have been recommended in hypertension. Public perception of risk strongly influences the acceptability of lifetime treatment, especially for mild hypertension. This era has also witnessed great advances in the development of antihypertensive drugs that combine efficacy with unsurpassed tolerability. However, the philosophy of Scottish teachers of Materia medica still appears to be followed-'never be the first or the last to prescribe a new drug'. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists are as safe and as efficacious as other antihypertensive medications and better tolerated. Large trials (HOT, HOPE, UKPDS and PROGRESS) point to the need for rigorous control of blood pressure particularly in high-risk individuals. Antihypertensive drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system will probably impact significantly on achieving optimal blood pressure levels. Should it not now be accepted that high-risk patients should have ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists prescribed as first-line agents? We review the evidence for the use of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists as antihypertensive agents.", 
    "170": "Antihypertensive drugs may have an important effect on glomerular haemodynamics. In chronic nephropathy patients, we compared the effect on glomerular haemodynamics of two second-generation dihydropyridinic agents, nitrendipine and amlodipine, with a first generation dihydropyridinic agent and an ACE-inhibitor, enalapril. In all, 32 patients (pts), divided into four groups, received the different drugs: ENA (enalapril, eight pts), NIF (nifedipine, eight pts), NIT (nitrendipine, eight pts) AML (amlodipine, eight pts). The study assessed the effect on glomerular haemodynamics of a single administration of the test drug in baseline conditions and in glomerular hyperfiltration experimentally induced by amino-acid infusion. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR, measured by inulin clearance), effective renal plasma flow (ERPF, measured by p-aminohippurate clearance), renal vascular resistances (RVR) and filtration fraction (FF) were assessed. Administration of AML and NIT test dose reduced FF, as did ENA, but not NIF, in both baseline (AML: P=0.005; NIT: P=0.02; ENA: P=0.007) and glomerular hyperfiltration conditions (AML: P=0.0003; NIT: P=0.03; ENA: P=0.00006). In baseline conditions, only ENA resulted in a significant drop in the GFR (P=0.008), while NIF, NIT and AML induced a significant increase (P=0.003, 0.03, 0.0001, respectively). However, in hyperfiltration conditions, NIT (0.08) and AML (0.00003) caused a decrease in the GFR, as did ENA (0.0003) but not NIF. In all the experimental conditions, a RVR reduction and an ERPF increase were observed. Single dose of NIT and AML were effective in attenuating the effect of amino-acid infusion on glomerular filtration, similar to ENA; this effect of NIT and AML on the glomerular filtration rate is not observed under basal conditions.",

It is often associated with increased mortality within the first year after myocardial infarction, with the highest frequency occurring among patients with left ventricular dysfunction. Therefore, increasing survival rates in patients with a history of both disorders is an important goal of therapy. Recent trials suggested that an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) in these patients may be superior to medical intervention in reducing the high mortality rate. Four major trials measured the benefits of an ICD for patients at risk for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. We assessed whether patients in these trials received adequate drug therapy as directed by American College of Cardiology-American Heart Association guidelines. One aim was to determine if medicated patients who served as controls in the trials were fairly represented. Furthermore, the need for improved overall guideline adherence was apparent.", 
    "176": "Posttransplantation hypertension has been identified as an independent risk factor for chronic allograft dysfunction and loss. Based on available morbidity and mortality data, posttransplantation hypertension must be identified and managed appropriately. During the past decade, calcium channel blockers have been recommended by some as the antihypertensive agents of choice in this population, because it was theorized that their vasodilatory effects would counteract the vasoconstrictive effects of the calcineurin inhibitors. With increasing data becoming available, reexamining the use of traditional antihypertensive agents, including diuretics and beta-blockers, or the newer agents, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers, may be beneficial. Transplant clinicians must choose antihypertensive agents that will provide their patients with maximum benefit, from both a renal and a cardiovascular perspective. Beta-blockers, diuretics, and ACE inhibitors have all demonstrated significant benefit on morbidity and mortality in patients with cardiovascular disease. Calcium channel blockers have been shown to possess the ability to counteract cyclosporine-induced nephrotoxicity. When compared with beta-blockers, diuretics, and ACE inhibitors, however, the relative risk of cardiovascular events is increased with calcium channel blockers. With the long-term benefits of calcium channel blockers on the kidney unknown and a negative cardiovascular profile, these agents are best reserved as adjunctive therapy to beta-blockers, diuretics, and ACE inhibitors.", 
    "177": "This longitudinal prospective study was designed to assess the effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) ramipril on ventricular mass, left ventricle (LV) diastolic function and blood pressure in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension and hyperinsulinemia. LV diastolic dysfunction is the first target organ alteration occurring in hypertensive patients, while ventricular hypertrophy is the most relevant predictive factor for cardiovascular morbility and mortality in systemic hypertension. Because several studies have demonstrated that there is no direct correlation between blood pressure values and the severity of LV hypertrophy or diastolic dysfunction, it is assumed that other factors are involved in the genesis of these functional alterations. Moreover, the hypertensive effect of insulin is caused by sympathetic stimulation, sodium and water renal retention and protooncogene stimulation leading to myocardial and vascular fibrosis and hypertrophy. We studied 24 hypertensive patients with hyperinsulinemia. All patients underwent an overall and cardiologic clinical evaluation, and electrocardiographic and ecocardiographic studies were performed at baseline and 6 months after being treated with 2.5 to 5 mg/day ramipril. Ramipril treatment significantly reduced systolic (12 mmHg) and diastolic (12 mmHg) pressure levels, basal insulin serum levels (23.62 pmol/dL vs 10.42 pmol/dL), and left ventricle mass index values (143.8 g/m2 vs 118.2 g/m2). Among the variables assessing LV diastolic function, only the transmitral flow E/A wave ratio showed significant differences in women.

    "178": "Drug therapy of coronary heart disease (CHD) is a life-long treatment. With every change from in-patient to out-patient care and back, changes in medication may occur. If a drug is chosen which provides no proven long-term benefit in terms of reduced morbidity and mortality, the expected therapeutic benefit may be missed. We investigated in 224 patients admitted to the medical departments of two hospitals (one with a specialized Cardiology Unit, one with a General Internal Medicine Unit) the prescriptions for CHD by the general practitioner before admittance into the hospital, the prescriptions recommended at the time of discharge, and the prescriptions made by the general practitioner three months after discharge. Of the drug classes with proven effects on morbidity and mortality (acetylsalicylic acid, beta-blockers, statins, ACE inhibitors), none had sufficiently high prescription rates. Prescription rates at discharge were 30% for beta-blockers and statins, 70% for acetylsalicylic acid, and 60% for ACE inhibitors. Only in patients with acute myocardial infarction were the prescription rates for these drug classes higher at this time point. The presence of contraindications was not of prime importance for the low prescription rates, as even in patients without contraindications prescription rates were not significantly higher than in the total patient cohort. Out of the patients with hypercholesterolemia, one third of those treated in the Cardiology Department and two thirds of those treated in the General Internal Medicine Department were not given any lipid-lowering medication. Prescription rates for those drug classes that provide symptomatic relief but have little impact on mortality rates (calcium channel blockers, nitrates) were high in both hospitals. The present study shows that evidence-based guidelines for the drug treatment of coronary heart disease are not adequately put into practice.",

In late 1995 we introduced a treatment program into the Tiwi community, which has a three- to fivefold increase in death rates and a recent annual incidence of treated ESRD of 2760 per million. Eligible for treatment were people with hypertension, diabetics with micro or overt albuminuria, and all people with overt albuminuria. Treatment centered around use of perindopril (Coversyl, Servier), with other agents added to reach BP goals; attempts to control glucose and lipid levels; and health education. Thirty percent of the adult population, or 267 people, were enrolled, with a mean follow up of 3.39 yr. Clinical parameters were followed every 6 mo, and rates of terminal endpoints were compared with those of 327 historical controls matched for baseline disease severity, followed in the pretreatment program era. There was a dramatic reduction in BP in the treatment group, which was sustained through 3 yr of treatment. Albuminuria and GFR stabilized or improved. Rates of natural deaths were reduced by an estimated 50% (P = 0.012); renal deaths were reduced by 57% (P = 0.038); and nonrenal deaths by 46% (P = 0.085). Survival benefit was suggested at all levels of overt albuminuria, and regardless of diabetes status, baseline BP, or prior administration of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI). No significant benefit was apparent among people without overt albuminuria, nor among those with GFR less than 60 ml/min. An estimated 13 renal deaths and 10 nonrenal deaths were prevented, with the number-needed-to-treat to avoid one terminal event of only 11.6. Falling deaths and renal failure in the whole community support these estimates. The program was extremely cost-effective. Programs like this should be introduced to all high-risk communities as a matter of urgency.",

The BP control levels are a lower goal (mean arterial pressure, </=92 mmHg) and a usual goal (mean arterial pressure, 102 to 107 mmHg inclusive). The primary outcome is rate of change in renal function as measured by GFR, assessed by (125) I-iothalamate clearance.

BP control can likely prevent the large majority of hypertensive renal disease. Testing for diabetic renal disease is well founded. In contrast, screening for hypertensive kidney disease is less well defined. Most established renal disease can be treated with glycemic control in the case of diabetes, BP treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, and dietary protein restriction. Other therapeutic targets have been proposed, but are not well established.

    "182": "Hypertension is a nutritional-hygienic disease. Long-term caloric intake in excess of energy expenditures, chronic supraphysiological intake of dietary sodium, excessive alcohol consumption, and psychosocial stressors all contribute to the development of hypertension throughout the world. Elevated BP, particularly systolic BP, has been linked to multiple adverse clinical outcomes including stroke, heart failure, myocardial infarction, renal insufficiency/failure, peripheral vascular disease, retinopathy, dementia, and premature mortality. These undesirable clinical outcomes are typically, although not invariably, preceded by pressure-related target-organ injury such as left ventricular hypertrophy, renal insufficiency and proteinuria. The relation of BP and CKD and, in turn, the prevention of CKD or forestalling its progression by hypertension treatment, will be the focus of this manuscript. In hypertensive persons with reduced kidney function and/or proteinuria, lowering BP with multidrug therapy that is inclusive of pharmacologic modulators of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-kinin system is an effective strategy to forestall the progressive loss of kidney function. The totality of data support low therapeutic BP targets for persons with proteinuria >1 g/d. Nevertheless, in persons with CKD, even those with proteinuria below the dipstick positive level (approximately 300 mg/d or urine protein to creatinine ratio of 0.22), aggressive BP control also may be warranted because of the high risk of nonrenal cardiovascular disease. Multiple antihypertensive drugs will be required in the vast majority of patients with diabetes and/or reduced kidney function to attain BP goal. Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) modulator therapy is indicated among persons with diabetes mellitus and CKD. Available data support the use of angiotensin receptor blockers in persons with type 2 diabetes and overt nephropathy for preservation of kidney function. Among persons with type I diabetes with or without overt nephropathy, type 2 diabetes without overt nephropathy and in nondiabetic CKD, the available clinical data support the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors as the RAS modulator of choice. Low therapeutic target BP levels <130/80 mmHg in persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus also appear warranted based on available data mostly for reducing the risk of nonrenal cardiovascular disease and overall mortality.", 
    "183": "Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors are effective in reducing renal disease progression in early diabetic nephropathy, but they provide imperfect protection at a later stage. Due to the pivotal role of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) in the pathogenesis of diabetic kidney disease, this study tested the effect of simultaneously interrupting TGF-beta and angiotensin II on disease progression in diabetic rats with overt nephropathy. Diabetes was induced by streptozotocin injection in uninephrectomized rats. Diabetic rats received murine (1D11) or human (CAT-192) anti-TGF-beta monoclonal antibodies alone or in combination with lisinopril, 13C4 irrelevant murine antibody, saline or lisinopril from month 4 (when animals had proteinuria) to month 8. Normal animals served as controls. Systolic BP increase was controlled by single treatments and even more by the combined therapies. 1D11 and lisinopril kept proteinuria at levels numerically lower than irrelevant antibody and saline, while CAT-192 was ineffective. The addition of either TGF-beta antibody to lisinopril normalized proteinuria. Consistent results were obtained for glomerulosclerosis and tubular damage, which were abrogated by the combined therapy. Interstitial volume expansion and infiltration of lymphocytes/macrophages were limited by 1D11 and lisinopril and further reduced by their combination. The increase of type III collagen in the renal interstitium was partially attenuated by 1D11 and lisinopril while normalized by their combination. It is concluded that anti-TGF-beta antibody when added to a background of chronic angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition fully arrests proteinuria and renal injury of overt diabetic nephropathy, providing a novel route to therapy and remission of disease for diabetic patients who do not respond to RAS inhibition.", 
    "184": "Resistance to recombinant human erythropoietin occurs in a small but important proportion of hemodialysis patients. This may be due to increased immune activation because pro-inflammatory cytokines inhibit erythropoiesis in vitro. Using FACScan flow cytometry, the proportion of PMA/ionomycin-stimulated T cells expressing cytokines ex vivo was compared in 18 poor responders to erythropoietin, 14 good responders to erythropoietin, and 14 normal controls. CD4(+) T cells from poor responders expressed more interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma; 19 +/- 6%) compared with good responders (11 +/- 6%, P < 0.001) and controls (12 +/- 6%, P < 0.01). Similarly, CD4+ T cells from poor responders expressed more tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha; poor responders: 51 +/- 19% versus good responders: 27 +/- 15% [P < 0.01] and controls: 30 +/- 19% [P < 0.01]).

Likewise, CD4+ expression of interleukin-13 (IL-13) was increased (poor responders: 4.4 +/- 4.2% versus good responders: 1.6 +/- 1.7% [P < 0.05] and controls: 1.6 +/- 1.5% [P < 0.05]). CD8+ T cells from poor responders also showed enhanced expression of cytokines. For IFN-gamma, poor responder expression was 48 +/- 20% compared with 31 +/- 17% (P < 0.05) for good responders and 23 +/- 15% (P < 0.01) for controls. TNF-alpha expression for poor responders was 41 +/- 21% versus 25 +/- 14% for good responders (P < 0.05) and 21 +/- 15% for controls (P < 0.01). IL-10 expression for poor responders was 2.0 +/- 1.2% (good responders: 0.7 +/- 0.6% [P < 0.01]; controls: 0.5 +/- 0.2% [P < 0.001]). These data indicate that T cells from poor responders are in an enhanced activation state possibly as a result of chronic inflammation. In the absence of any other cause (such as iron deficiency), the overproduction of cytokines may account for hyporesponsiveness to erythropoietic therapy in patients with renal failure.",

Several recent studies indicate that ACE inhibitor therapy reduces the development of type 2 diabetes in persons with essential hypertension, a population with a high prevalence of insulin resistance. ACE inhibitor therapy has been shown to improve surrogates of cardiovascular disease (eg, vascular compliance, endothelial-derived nitric oxide production, vascular relaxation and plasma markers of inflammation, oxidative stress, and thrombosis) and reduce cardiovascular disease, renal disease progression, and stroke. This article explores potential mechanism by which ACE inhibition reduces the development of diabetes, improves these surrogate markers, and reduces cardiovascular disease and renal disease.", 
    "186": "The immunologic response in atherosclerosis involves not only intrinsic cells of the artery wall, but also circulating leukocytes, lymphocytes, and macrophages. Interaction of various arms of the immune response modulates plaque development and stability, and it is conceivable that immunologic effects of some cardiovascular therapies may contribute to their mechanism of benefit. The preponderance of data has accrued with the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins). Statin effects, such as inhibition of T cell activation, tissue factor expression, or reduction of platelet hyperreactivity, may elicit beneficial effects in vitro and in vivo in patients with coronary artery disease. Moreover, aspirin may limit oxidation of lipoproteins and fibrinogen, and it may inhibit cytokine-induced nitric oxide synthase II expression. The hypothesis that selective inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) may increase risk of myocardial infarction is controversial and may also be of questionable clinical significance. Finally, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors not only reduce proinflammatory mediators, such as interleukin-6, but also enhance the concentration of anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-10. Because ACE is expressed at the shoulder region of atherosclerotic plaques, and ACE activity is enhanced in unstable plaques, ACE inhibition may also contribute to plaque stability. This article reviews the potential immunomodulatory potencies of aspirin, COX-2 inhibitors, statins, and ACE inhibitors as established pharmacotherapy in patients with coronary artery disease.", 
    "187": "The acute coronary syndromes arise from procoagulant changes in complex plaques, which trigger both platelet activation and coagulation pathways. These 2 pathways intersect at a number of points that form positive-feedback loops to sustain and accelerate thrombus formation. In normal hemostasis and with a healthy endothelium, intravascular thrombosis is prevented, and vascular patency is protected by the fibrinolytic system and a number of antithrombotic factors, such as antithrombin, thrombomodulin, and tissue factor pathway inhibitor. However, atherosclerosis is characterized by a hypercoagulable state, and the fibrinolytic balance is skewed toward occlusive thrombus formation at critical sites on vulnerable plaques. This review focuses on cellular and humoral mechanisms and the antithrombotic strategies that are important during the acute phase of an ischemic coronary syndrome, both in patients managed conservatively and in patients scheduled for an interventional procedure. These strategies include fibrinolytic therapy, antiplatelet therapies (aspirin, clopidogrel, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors), and low-molecular-weight heparin.",

However, data with respect to circadian blood pressure (BP) monitoring and urinary protein (uP) excretion are lacking in normotensive or mild hypertensive patients with chronic renal diseases. This study has evaluated the effects of 80 mg telmisartan, given as monotherapy, on 24 h BP levels and uP loss in 16 non-diabetic patients affected by proteinuric renal disease. These patients did not meet the recommended values of mean BP, i.e. < 98 mmHg, when proteinuria was 0.5-1.0 g/d and mean BP < 92 mmHg, when proteinuria was 1-3 g/d. Patients with diastolic BP > 114 mmHg, nephrotic syndrome or severe renal failure (creatinine clearance < 20 ml/min) were excluded. After 4.2 +/- 2.7 month therapy, ambulatory BP monitoring showed a significant decrease (P < 0.001) of 24 h BP levels: systolic 135 +/- 11 vs. 122 +/- 13 mmHg, diastolic 84.4 +/- 8.1 vs. 75.9 +/- 8.5 mmHg, mean 101 +/- 8 vs. 91 +/- 9 mmHg. The effect was quite evident during either day-time or night-time. Clinic BP levels also significantly decreased (P < 0.001), and five patients reached the target values. uP excretion lowered by 37% (median) from 1.60 +/- 0.90 to 1.06 +/- 0.63 g/24 h (P < 0.01). No change in creatinine clearance (53.3 +/- 31.1 vs. 51.7 +/- 30.9 ml/min) or serum potassium level (4.3 +/- 0.3 vs. 4.4 +/- 0.4 mEq/l) was observed. Our results show that 80 mg of telmisartan, taken once daily, is effective in reducing uP excretion and BP throughout the 24 h, in normotensive or mild hypertensive renal patients. Since evidence exists that adequate control of BP, including during night-time, and reduction of proteinuria play a crucial role in the protection of renal function, telmisartan can be usefully considered in the conservative treatment of renal patients.",

These effects of perindoprilat were also observed in HUVEC activated by tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, which increased the expression of intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), CD54, and, despite up-regulation of prostacyclin release, attenuated endothelial anti-platelet properties by decreasing ecto-ADPase activity. Perindoprilat partially restored this capability, but failed to reduce enhanced expression of ICAM-1. By contrast, the role of NO as a platelet inhibitor appeared minimal in HUVEC. Candesartan, an angiotensin II receptor (AT(1)) blocker, did not affect endothelial anti-platelet property.",

    "202": "The clinical course of a young female patient with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) who failed to respond to any of the recommended therapeutic protocols will represent the background of a discussion of currently available alternative treatments for FSGS. Traditionally, FSGS has been believed to have a poor prognosis, with a low response rate to treatment and a progressive course terminating with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Some 40% of patients respond to prolonged corticosteroid treatment. Steroid resistance in adults should perhaps be assumed only after failure to respond to a 6-month course of daily steroid therapy. Regarding recent recommendations, the use of cytotoxic therapy (cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil or azathioprine) may be considered as second-line therapy (evidence D). Treatment with cyclosporin A at doses of 4-6 mg/kg/day has been successful in reducing proteinuria. There is little information available on the effects of such treatment on the progression of FSGS. Even fewer data are available on the success rate of the use of tacrolimus in resistant forms of FSGS in adults. Mycophenolate mofetil has been used with impressive success in a few high-risk patients who failed on previous therapeutic regimens. There is preliminary evidence in an uncontrolled series of patients with resistant primary FSGS that the addition of plasmapheresis may provide effective long-term benefits in some patients. The accurate assessment of the role of plasmapheresis and possibly immunoadsorption in the management of patients with FSGS requires further evaluation. Non-immunosuppressive therapy (i.e. angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, lipid-lowering drugs, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) should be applied to almost all patients with primary FSGS.", 
    "203": "Arterial hypertension (AH) per se is, together with diabetes mellitus, the most important cause of renal failure and of dialysis in the western world. AH is also a well known consequence of chronic renal disease, and at the same time one of the main factors which causes diabetic and/or non-diabetic chronic renal failure progression. AH is mostly registered in patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and with membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. The pathophysiology and the mechanism of AH within primary glomerular diseases are complex, including activation of the sympathetic nervous system, the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), sodium retention, volume expansion and decreased synthesis of vasodilatatory substances. As autoregulation of glomerular pressure in chronic glomerular disease is disturbed, the increment in systemic blood pressure leads to the rise in glomerular pressure. Glomerular hypertension results in glomerular capillary wall stretch, endothelial damage and a rise in protein glomerular filtration. These processes, in turn, cause changes of mesangial and proximal tubular cells, ultimately resulting in the replacement of functional by non-functional connective tissue and the development of fibrosis. One of the most important factors in the progression of chronic renal failure is activation of the RAS. Its effect is not only elevated blood pressure, but also the promotion of cell proliferation, inflammation and matrix accumulation. Many studies, first in experimental animals and later in humans, have shown that the lowering of blood pressure (and proteinuria) is associated with a slower progression of kidney disease. It seems that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) are more renoprotective than other antihypertensives (the protection beyond the antihypertensive effect), although some studies have also confirmed a comparatively beneficial effect of non-dihydropiridine calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). Moreover, it seems that a combination of antihypertensives (e.g. ACEI + CCB, ACEI + ARB) has a more effective action than either of the drugs alone. However, the effects depend first on the degree of blood pressure reduction. According to comprehensive studies, the achievement of adequate blood pressure (not higher than 130/85 mmHg) is the most important factor. An even lower blood pressure (125/75 mmHg) has been suggested as the limit value in patients with proteinuria of >1 g/24 h and in Blacks.", 
    "204": "The increased activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is an important pathogenetic factor in the development of nephropathy in diabetic patients. The damaging factor of this system is the end-product, angiotensin II, and the damaging effects are vasoconstriction, increase of aldosterone secretion, growth, fibrosis, thrombosis, inflammation and oxidation. Theoretically, on this basis, blockade of the RAAS should have a beneficial effect on the development of diabetic nephropathy. The main goal in the treatment of diabetic nephropathy is control of the glycaemic status and aggressive antihypertensive therapy, primarily with RAAS-blocking agents. It was demonstrated recently that angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) have a slowing effect on the progression of diabetic nephropathy (RENAAL and IDNT trials) or on the development of proteinuria (IRMA) in type 2 diabetes. These effects are specific and independent of the decrease in blood pressure. Theoretically, the combination of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and an ARB can lead to a more complete blockade of the RAAS. A new study (ONTARGET) has now started to investigate whether treatment with a combination of an ACEI and an ARB has a more potent beneficial effect on the cardiovascular events and the nephropathy in type 2 diabetic patients as compared with separate treatment with the two agents.", 
    "205": "Captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, is widely used in the treatment of a variety of cardiomyopathies, but its effect on autoimmune myocarditis has not been addressed experimentally. We investigated the effect of captopril on myosin-induced experimental autoimmune myocarditis. A/J mice, immunized with syngeneic cardiac myosin, were given 75 mg/L of captopril in their drinking water. Captopril dramatically reduced the incidence and severity of myocarditis, which was accompanied by a reduction in heart weight to body weight ratio and heart weight. Captopril specifically interfered with cell-mediated immunity as myosin delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) was reduced, while anti-myosin Ab production was not affected. Captopril-treated, OVA-immunized mice also exhibited a decrease in OVA DTH. In myosin-immunized, untreated mice, injection of captopril directly into the test site also suppressed myosin DTH. Interestingly, captopril did not directly affect Ag-specific T cell responsiveness because neither in vivo nor in vitro captopril treatment affected the proliferation, IFN-gamma secretion, or IL-2 secretion by Ag-stimulated cultured splenocytes. These results indicate that captopril ameliorates experimental autoimmune myocarditis and may act, at least in part, by interfering with the recruitment of cells to sites of inflammation and the local inflammatory environment.",

Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) that hybridize with cathepsin D and cathepsin G significantly inhibited FN-increased Ang II in conditioned medium and cell extracts. In VSMC conditioned medium, FN-induced elevation of Ang II was significantly inhibited by temocapril but not by chymostatin. Ang II type 1 receptor antagonist CV11974 completely, and antisense cathepsin D and cathepsin G ODNs partially inhibited the FN-stimulated growth of human VSMC. These results indicate that the change of homogeneous cultures of human VSMC from the contractile to the synthetic phenotype sequentially increases expression of proteases cathepsin D, cathepsin G, and ACE, production of Ang II and productions of growth factors, culminating in VSMC proliferation. These findings implicate a new mechanism for the pathogenesis of human vascular proliferative diseases.",

This report presents our preliminary experience with the novel use of combined mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and angiotensin blockade (AB) in the treatment of nine children and young adults with focal glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). All patients were steroid resistant and had failed conventional treatment regimens. Prior to the initiation of the MMF-AB protocol, the patients were pre-treated with weekly intravenous methylprednisolone (MP) (15 mg/kg per week) for 4-8 weeks. Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin receptor blockers were begun when intravascular volume was restored. MMF was given at a dose of 250-500 mg/m(2) per day. Proteinuria, as measured by urine protein/creatinine ratios (Up/c), decreased by 43% following MP ( P<0.05). After 6 months of MMF-AB protocol, the Up/c was 72% below baseline ( P<0.01). This level was maintained for a minimum of 24 months of observation. Similarly, hyperlipidemia, as measured by total cholesterol and triglycerides, improved significantly with treatment (536+/-163 to 265+/-70 mg/dl, 447+/-168 to 230+/-92 mg/dl, respectively, P<0.01). Our data support the use of MMF and AB for treatment of steroid-resistant FSGS when other conventional treatments have failed and/or induced toxicity.", 
    "239": "The present study characterized the persistent changes (ie, off-treatment) resulting from short-term antihypertensive treatments on mean arterial pressure (MAP) and structurally based vascular resistance. Rats were treated for 14 days with enalapril (30 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)) with regular (ENAL, 0.4%) or low salt (ELS, 0.04%) diets, or a triple therapy (Triple: hydralazine 45 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1), hydrochlorothiazide 100 mg/L, and nifedipine 200 mg/d). MAP was continuously recorded via radiotelemetry. Structurally based hindlimb vascular resistance properties (resistance at maximum dilation [Max Dil]; resistance at maximum constriction [Max Con]) were assessed after 14-day enalapril treatment and 2 to 3 weeks after all drugs were withdrawn. Aortic urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) activity was measured by zymography after 14 days of ELS. All treatments induced a significant, persistent decrease in the off-treatment MAP (ENAL downward arrow 12+/-4.6%, ELS downward arrow 16+/-2.6%, Triple downward arrow 5+/-4.17%). During treatment (14 days) the enalapril group had significant changes in the index of medial bulk (Max Con downward arrow 15+/-2.6%), but only minimal changes in lumen properties (Max Dil downward arrow 3+/-6.5%, NS). After stopping therapy, vascular properties at Max Dil were significantly decreased only in the 2 enalapril groups (ENAL downward arrow 15+/-7.9%, P<0.05; ELS downward arrow 9+/-6.0%, P<0.05; Triple downward arrow 2+/-9.8%, NS), whereas Max Con was significantly decreased in all groups (ENAL downward arrow 12+/-8.0%, ELS downward arrow 16+/-6.1%, Triple downward arrow 7+/-5.4%). At 14 days of ELS treatment, there was increased aortic uPA activity (1.6-fold). The findings reveal that various short-term antihypertensive treatments can produce persistent long-term changes in MAP and vascular structure. Further, the magnitude of the depressor response may be as important in inducing persistent changes as is the removal of angiotensin II.",

Omapatrilat decreased mean arterial pressure, reducing total peripheral resistance as well as decreased left ventricular and aortic mass indices. It also induced a profound renovasodilation associated with a decrease renal vascular resistance that markedly increased renal blood flow. Coronary hemodynamics and left ventricular hydroxyproline concentration remained unaltered. Concomitant blockade of bradykinin receptors partially attenuated the hypotensive effect of omapatrilat and its effect on aortic mass; and icatibant did not influence the renovasodilation.",

The informed consent was received from 12 hypertensive patients with renal failure, who were under haemodialysis (42 to 62 years). The patients received oral administration of quinapril (10 mg) or perindopril (2 mg) once a day for four weeks. First, to evaluate the dialyzability of each metabolite, blood samples were collected before and after haemodialysis one week after the repeated doses. Second, to evaluate the elimination kinetics of quinaprilat or perindoprilat, blood samples were collected at 24, 72, 120, 192 and 240 h after the final administration. Plasma concentrations of quinaprilat and perindoprilat were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and radioimmunoassay, respectively. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined by a model-dependent method. Values of haemodialysis clearance (CL(HD)) and extraction ratio (ER) were 51.5+/-30.2 ml/min and 0.35+/-0.21 for quinaprilat and 108.1+/-5.9 ml/min and 0.75+/-0.04 for perindoprilat, respectively. The terminal elimination half-lives of quinaprilat and perindoprilat were 60.7+/-2.1 and 79.9+/-14.0 h, respectively. The dialyzability of perindoprilat was much higher than that of quinaprilat probably due to low protein binding potency. The present study suggests that hypertensive patients receiving chronic therapy with quinapril or perindopril on haemodialysis should be withdrawn for at least 2 to 3 weeks before LDL apheresis.",

Anti-Thy-1 nephritis was induced by intravenous injection of 300 microg/kg of anti-Thy-1.1 monoclonal antibody into rats. KD3-671 (3, 10, 30 mg/kg per day) or enalapril (30 mg/kg per day), an angiotensin II converting enzyme inhibitor, was given p.o. once daily from the day before the antibody injection (the 1st day) to the 15th day after. KD3-671 significantly inhibited an increase in the number of total and proliferating cell nuclear antigen-positive cells and the deposition of alpha-smooth muscle actin and fibronectin in the glomeruli of nephritic rats, but enalapril (30 mg/kg per day) suppressed only the number of total cells and the deposition of alpha-smooth muscle actin in the glomeruli. Moreover, to elucidate the effect of KD3-671 on matrix deposition in the glomeruli, we measured the production of fibronectin in isolated glomeruli obtained from anti-Thy-1 nephritic rats. The glomeruli in anti-Thy-1 nephritic rats produced more fibronectin than that in control rats. KD3-671 (10(-8), 10(-7), 10(-6) M) dose-dependently attenuated fibronectin production in isolated nephritic glomeruli.

The present study was designed to determine the association between treatment with ACEI and the development of coronary collateral circulation, as assessed by the Rentrop Score, in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) in a case - control study. Subjects included 456 patients with angina who underwent coronary angiography. Those who had one (1-V), two (2-V) or three (3-V) significantly stenosed vessels, and who received only ACEI without any other anti-hypertensive medication were defined as cases (n=33), and age, sex and body mass index-matched subjects (n=56) were selected as controls. Among 1-V patients, but not 2-V or 3-V patients, the cases included a higher percentage of patients with Rentrop Score of at least 1 than the controls, suggesting that ACEI was associated with coronary collateral circulation. Patients with 1-V disease who were treated with ACEI were most likely [odds ratio (confidence interval): 6.1 (1.4-30.1)] to develop collateral circulation, as assessed by a multiple logistic regression analysis. Therefore, treatment with ACEI was associated with the development of collateral circulation in patients with CAD, suggesting that such an action is associated with bradykinin production by ACEI.",

    "271": "Sarcoidosis is now recognised as a member of a large family of granulomatous disorders and has been reported from all parts of the world. Current evidence points to genetic predisposition and exposure to yet unknown transmissible agent(s) and/or environmental factors as etiological agents. Depending on the organ systems involved, patients with sarcoidosis present themselves to various specialities; pulmonary involvement is by far the commonest and occurs in about 90 per cent of the patients. The diagnosis is based on a compatible clinical and/or radiological picture, histopathological evidence of non-caseating granulomas in tissue biopsy specimens and exclusion of other diseases capable of producing similar clinical or histopathological appearances. Sarcoidosis is an underdiagnosed disease in India. However, owing to the increasing awareness, it is being diagnosed more frequently than a few decades ago. Most Indian patients with sarcoidosis are males and present in the fourth or fifth decade of life. The disease runs a benign course with spontaneous remission of the activity though some degree of residual pulmonary function abnormality persists. Only a minority of the patients develop complicated disease. Corticosteroids remain the mainstay of treatment. For asymptomatic patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis, no therapy is required. Corticosteroid treatment should be considered in symptomatic patients with evidence of radiological or pulmonary function deterioration. Treatment under close clinical monitoring should be tailored to suit the needs of the individual patient. Sometimes steroid-sparing alternative treatments may be beneficial. In this review, the current understanding of the global scenario and Indian perspective of sarcoidosis are critically reviewed.",

The present study addressed whether or not triple therapy with low-dose ARB, low-dose diuretic (D) and calcium channel blocker(CCB) (ARB/D/CCB) is as effective as therapy with low-dose ARB/ACE-I in retarding the progression of overt diabetic nephropathy. In the triple therapy, the patients were initially subjected to monotherapy with CCB for 24 weeks. Low-dose ARB and low-dose D were added to the treatment for an additional 24-week period. In parallel, patients undergoing double therapy were initially treated with low-dose ACE-I alone for 24 weeks, and then low-dose ARB was added for an additional 24-week period. The results were as follows: 1) In the triple therapy, blood pressure was reduced by 9 mmHg in systole and 5 mmHg in diastole (not significant) compared to monotherapy with CCB. There was a significant decline in proteinuria (3.3 +/- 1.2 g/day in the CCB-treated period vs. 2.1 +/- 1.0 g/day in the ARB/D/CCB-treated period, n = 12, p = 0.0143). Furthermore, a significant improvement in the slope of reciprocal serum creatinine concentration(1/Cr) was found in response to triple therapy(1/Cr: -0.0118 +/- 0.0009 in the CCB-treated vs. -0.0035 +/- 0.0028(I/mg/dl/month) in the ARB/D/CCB-treated period, n = 12, p < 0.001). There was neither a worsening of anemia nor an increase in the serum potassium(K) concentration. 2) In the double therapy, blood pressure was reduced by 12 mmHg in systole(p = 0.0079, n = 11) and 6 mmHg in diastole(n = 11, p = 0.0037) compared to the monotherapy with ACE-I.

In addition, there was a substantial reduction in hematocrit and increase in serum K concentration.

Whole body insulin sensitivity was measured by a formula derived from an oral glucose tolerance test and named as the insulin sensitivity index (ISI). Insulin was measured by chemiluminescence and glucose by a glucose oxidase method.

The mechanism of these favourable effects of ACE inhibition needs to be clarified.", 
    "278": "Proteinuria is assumed to play a pathogenetic role in progressive renal damage. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition reduces proteinuria and provides renoprotection. This suggests that ACE activity might play a pathogenetic role in the development of proteinuria-induced renal structural damage. We investigated this hypothesis in untreated and treated established adriamycin nephrosis, a model of proteinuria-induced renal damage. In a time-course experiment, the development of renal structural damage in untreated adriamycin nephrotic rats was paralleled by a significant rise in renal ACE activity. Moreover, on cross-sectional analysis, a consistent positive correlation between renal, but not plasma, ACE activity and proteinuria, focal glomerulosclerosis and interstitial injury was present. Notably, these associations were present, not only in the untreated condition, but also during intervention with either ACE inhibition or AT(1)-receptor antagonism. Interestingly, we found that higher renal ACE activity is associated with more severe renal damage for a given amount of proteinuria, suggesting that renal ACE activity may be either a permissive or a promoting factor in the processes by which proteinuria eventually leads to renal structural damage. This relationship was abolished by renin-angiotensin system (RAS)-blockade, suggesting that RAS-mediated effects are involved in the relationship between renal ACE activity and proteinuria-induced renal damage. In conclusion, in untreated as well as treated adriamycin nephrotic rats, renal ACE activity is closely associated with renal outcome. This association appears to be independent of the specific mode of blockade of the RAS. Renal ACE activity is a consistent marker of individual differences in proteinuria-associated renal damage: further studies are needed to investigate a possible pathogenetic role in renal damage.",

    "282": "Blockade of the effects of angiotensin II (Ang II) by using an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor has been proven to be of value in Type 1 diabetic nephropathy and in non-diabetic renal disease. Evidence in favour of Ang II blockade in Type 2 diabetic patients with renal damage is still lacking for ACE inhibitors (ACE-Is), while recent data indicate that angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) could be the drugs of choice in this situation. On the other hand, renal damage from the onset of disease is accompanied by a very significant increment in global cardiovascular risk. This fact, as well as that of simultaneous renal and cardiovascular protection, have to be considered for drug selection. In this sense, ACE-Is have been shown to be the drugs of choice when secondary cardiovascular prevention is required, while the evidence in primary prevention in hypertensive patients has been shown with losartan in the Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction in hypertension (LIFE) study. All these facts led to the conclusion that both ACE-Is and ARBs can be considered when both renal and cardiovascular protection are aimed for in Type 2 diabetic patients.", 
    "283": "The ability of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) to lower blood pressure (BP) is well established. ACE inhibitors (ACE-Is) have also been shown to improve the prognosis of a broad range of patients at high cardiovascular risk, including those with heart failure, post-myocardial infarction (MI), and nephropathy. These benefits suggest that interrupting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) with ACE-Is has a widespread vasculoprotective effect, provided that BP is also adequately controlled. Evidence that RAAS blockade by ARBs also improves long-term clinical outcomes in patients with cardiovascular disease has started to accumulate, and will be tested further during the coming years as a number of large-scale, prospective trials are completed. These trials are investigating the long-term protective effects of ARBs on morbidity and mortality in patients with hypertension, heart failure, diabetes mellitus, acute MI, or established vascular disease. The results should establish the extent to which ARBs exhibit the vasculoprotective properties demonstrated by ACE-Is in patients at high cardiovascular risk. If ARBs are found to provide benefits that are similar to, or even greater than ACE-Is, it may have important implications for drug selection, given the excellent tolerability of ARBs. Some studies are also investigating whether more extensive RAAS blockade using a combination of an ARB and an ACE-I will offer even greater protection than either agent alone.", 
    "284": "Somatic angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) contains two homologous domains, each bearing a functional active site. The in vivo contribution of each active site to the release of angiotensin II (Ang II) and the inactivation of bradykinin (BK) is still unknown. To gain insights into the functional roles of these two active sites, the in vitro and in vivo effects of compounds able to selectively inhibit only one active site of ACE were determined, using radiolabeled Ang I or BK, as physiological substrates of ACE. In vitro studies indicated that a full inhibition of the Ang I and BK cleavage requires a blockade of the two ACE active sites. In contrast, in vivo experiments in mice demonstrated that the selective inhibition of either the N-domain or the C-domain of ACE by these inhibitors prevents the conversion of Ang I to Ang II, while BK protection requires the inhibition of the two ACE active sites. Thus, in vivo, the cleavage of Ang I and BK by ACE appears to obey to different mechanisms. Remarkably, in vivo the conversion of Ang I seems to involve the two active sites of ACE, free of inhibitor. Based on these findings, it might be suggested that the gene duplication of ACE in vertebrates may represent a means for regulating the cleavage of Ang I differently from that of BK.",

Consensus guidelines have been developed to guide care and improve quality of life based on current evidence or best practice. This article will provide a brief overview of medications and lifestyle modifications described in guidelines developed by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association, the Canadian Cardiovascular Society, the Heart Failure Society of America, and the European Society of Cardiology. Medications for treating heart failure can be divided into two groups: those with a mortality benefit (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, beta-blockers, and selective aldosterone receptor antagonists), and those that improve symptoms (diuretics and cardiac glycosides). Nursing implications include careful assessment of volume status, vital signs, monitoring electrolyte and renal function, as well as spacing of medications. Nurses play a key role in assisting patients to identify their lifestyle habits that require modifications, ultimately improving their quality of life and decreasing hospital readmissions. Education focusing on self-care activities, diet, rest, and exercise enables patients to retain a sense of control in their lives.",

Only ACE-i alone and in combination, but not ET(A)-RB alone prevented loss of podocytes and podocyte hypertrophy. In diabetic rats, increased numbers of PCNA positive and p27(kip1) positive cells (mainly podocytes) were reduced by all treatments, but only ACE-i decreased numbers of desmin positive podocytes and tubulointerstitial expression of TGF-beta.

Treatment with an ACE-i, but not with an ET(A)-RB, prevented the development of albuminuria as well as damage and loss of podocytes. The well known anti-proteinuric effect of ACE-i is presumably due at least in part to conservation of podocyte structure. Increased plasma endothelin-1 (ET-1) concentrations and urine excretion of ET-1 have been documented in patients with diabetes and proteinuria [1]. It has been shown that experimental diabetes mellitus increases renal ET-1 gene transcription [2]. To assess the relevance of the ET-system in the pathogenesis of renal structural changes in the model of the STZ-induced diabetic rat we compared the effect of an ET(A)-receptor specific antagonist with the well known beneficial effect of an ACE-i, especially on podocyte cell number and morphology.", 
    "302": "Atherogenic low-density lipoproteins (LDL) are characterized by elevations in cholesterol content and increased electronegativity, factors that contribute to aggregation and foam cell formation. This study was designed to test the effect of the positively charged calcium channel blocker (CCB) amlodipine on the aggregation properties of oxidized LDL lipids. Large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) (100 nm diameter) labeled with a non-exchangeable marker [3H]cholesteryl hexadecyl ether were prepared with lipids extracted from human LDL following oxidation. The LUVs were shown to bind, in a reversible fashion, to charged diethylaminoethyl Sephadex columns. The addition of amlodipine inhibited binding of the oxidized LDL lipids in a dose-dependent fashion with an IC(50) in the nanomolar range as a result of its high lipophilicity and positively charged amino group (pK(a) of 9.02). The activity of amlodipine was reproduced in model membranes that contained fixed amounts of charged phospholipid (glycerophospholipid) in a concentration-dependent manner. By contrast, drugs lacking a formal positive charge, including CCBs (felodipine, nifedipine, diltiazem, verapamil) and an angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitor (ramiprilate) had no effect on the column binding of the modified, electronegative lipids. These effects of amlodipine on LDL lipid aggregation and electrostatic properties may represent a novel antiatherosclerotic mechanism of action.", 
    "303": "The main objective of this study was to compare the anti-hypertensive efficacy and safety of nebivolol (5 mg once daily) and lisinopril (20 mg once daily) given for 12 weeks in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. Fourteen centres participated in this randomized, double-blind parallel group study. Sixty-eight patients with uncomplicated mild-to-moderate hypertension were randomized, and sixty-five were eligible for the analysis of efficacy (intention-to-treat). Hypertensive patients were newly diagnosed, or previous antihypertensive therapy was withdrawn at least 1 month before active treatment, and were included in the study if their diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was > 95 and < 114 mmHg. The age range was 24-65 years. The primary endpoints of the study were: (i) response rate: patients were defined as \"normalized\" responders if their blood pressure values were < 140/90 mmHg, or as \"non-normalized\" responders if the reduction in blood pressure was 10 mmHg or more, compared with baseline; (ii) changes in sitting blood pressure at the end of the study. The secondary endpoints were: standing blood pressure and sitting or standing heart rate (HR). Results showed that baseline sitting DBP was significantly different between groups. Analysis of covariance of the raw data performed with baseline as covariate demonstrated that the DBP and HR values were significantly lower in the nebivolol group at the 8th week. However, when an analysis of variance for repeated measures was performed, a significant reduction in sitting systolic blood pressure (SBP) (p < 0.0001), DBP (p < 0.0001) and HR (p < 0.0001) was observed throughout the study in both groups. No difference was observed between treatments, although for DBP, a significant interaction between treatment-weeks was observed (p = 0.016). There was also a statistically significant difference in favour of the nebivolol group in the distribution of responders and non-responders at week 8. Lisinopril and nebivolol were equally well tolerated. In conclusion, nebivolol was slightly more effective, in comparison with lisinopril, in terms of reduction in DBP. This greater efficacy was obtained without any increase in adverse effects, since both treatments were equally well tolerated.",

Indeed, diabetes is the most common cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the United States, accounting for > 40% of patients starting renal replacement therapy each year. Unfortunately, the outcome for diabetic patients with ESRD is worse than that for nondiabetic patients because of comorbid conditions in the diabetic population.

During the last six hours of the dosing interval, telmisartan 40 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg and telmisartan 80 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg reduced mean ambulatory diastolic blood pressure (DBP) to a greater extent than losartan 50 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg (treatment differences 1.8 mmHg [p < 0.05] and 2.5 mmHg [p < 0.001], respectively). Telmisartan 80 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg also lowered mean 24-hour DBP by 2.3 mmHg more than losartan 50 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg (p < 0.001). Telmisartan 40 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg and telmisartan 80 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg produced greater reductions in ambulatory systolic blood pressure versus losartan 50 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg of 2.5 mmHg and 3.4 mmHg, respectively, during the last six hours of the dosing interval (p < 0.05), and of 2.1 mmHg and 3.4 mmHg, respectively, over the entire 24-hour dosing interval (p < 0.05).

    "311": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), a type I integral membrane protein that plays a major role in vasoactive peptide metabolism, is shed from the plasma membrane by proteolytic cleavage within the juxtamembrane stalk. To investigate whether this shedding is regulated by lateral segregation in cholesterol-rich lipid rafts, Chinese hamster ovary cells and human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with either wild-type ACE (WT-ACE) or a construct with a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor attachment signal replacing the transmembrane and cytosolic domains (GPI-ACE). In both cell types, GPI-ACE, but not WT-ACE, was sequestered in caveolin or flotillin-enriched lipid rafts and was released from the cell surface by treatment with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. When cells were treated with activators of the protein kinase C signalling cascade (phorbol myristate acetate or carbachol) the shedding of GPI-ACE was stimulated to a similar extent to that of WT-ACE. The release of WT-ACE and GPI-ACE from the cells was inhibited in an identical manner by a range of hydroxamate-based zinc metalloprotease inhibitors. Disruption of lipid rafts by filipin treatment did not alter the shedding of GPI-ACE, and phorbol ester treatment did not alter the distribution of WT-ACE or GPI-ACE between raft and non-raft membrane compartments. These data clearly show that the protein kinase C-stimulated shedding of ACE does not require the transmembrane or cytosolic regions of the protein, and that sequestration in lipid rafts does not regulate the shedding of the protein.",

To carry out a large-scale practice-based open-label trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) in controlling blood pressure (BP) in the community setting, 703 practitioners recruited 2705 hypertensive patients. There were three groups: untreated at the time of study entry with uncontrolled BP (>/=140/90 mm Hg) (N = 1957); treated but uncontrolled on current monotherapy (N = 685); and treated and controlled, but with unacceptable side effects (N = 63). After stopping any previous treatment, patients received telmisartan (40 mg daily) for 2 weeks; the dose was increased to 80 mg if BP remained >/=130/85 mm Hg. Participants were then followed for a further 4 weeks. Blood pressure decreased by 18.9/12.3 mm Hg in the untreated group, by 13.1/7.9 mm Hg in the previously treated but uncontrolled group, and increased slightly by 3.5/1.3 mm Hg in the previously controlled group. Patients not responding adequately to the 40-mg telmisartan dose had an initial BP reduction of 7.3/4.5 mm Hg; titration to 80 mg gave an additional 7.5/5.0 mm Hg reduction and controlled BP (<140/90 mm Hg) in 44% of these titrated patients. Overall, control occurred in 56% of white patients; 52% of black patients (who responded well to dose titration); 60% of patients <65 years; and 46% of patients >/=65 years. Thus, in contrast with the relatively flat dose response effects in controlled parallel group trials, this practice-based trial has demonstrated the value of titrating telmisartan to its maximum dose in patients with inadequate BP responses to the initial dose, and has shown its efficacy across major demographic groups.",

    "407": "Serial decline in electrocardiographic voltage in patients with increased left ventricular mass has been associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular events.", 
    "408": "We studied 468 patients with diabetes mellitus and hypertension in the Appropriate Blood Pressure Control in Diabetes (ABCD) trial. Patients were randomized in a stratified design to receive initial treatment with either enalapril or nisoldipine and to either intensive or moderate treatment goals. We measured an electrocardiographic index for increased left ventricular mass, the adjusted Cornell voltage, serially by treatment group. The association between changes in electrocardiographic voltage and cardiovascular events was defined with Cox proportional hazards analysis.", 
    "409": "In 5 years of follow-up, the decline in adjusted Cornell voltage was significantly greater for patients treated with enalapril than for patients treated with nisoldipine (repeated measures analysis of variance P =.002). In the Cox proportional hazards model, treatment assignment (enalapril vs nisoldipine) was the strongest predictor of cardiovascular events, but the presence of coronary disease at baseline, the duration of diabetes mellitus, and change in voltage were also independent predictors of cardiovascular events.", 
    "410": "In the ABCD study, enalapril treatment was associated with a lower risk of myocardial infarction. The reduction in left ventricular mass as reflected by diminished electrocardiographic voltage may explain some, but not all, of the effect of enalapril in this study.", 
    "411": "Although many aspects of ureteral physiology are well characterized, the exact mechanism of ureteral smooth muscle modulation has not been fully established. In other smooth muscle contractility is modulated by angiotensin II (AngII). We determined the presence of a local ureteral renin-angiotensin system and characterized the functional role of AngII in ureteral smooth muscle.", 
    "412": "Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was performed to determine the expression of angiotensinogen, renin, angiotensin-converting enzyme and angiotensin receptor subtype 1 mRNA. The presence of AngII in ureteral tissue was determined by immunohistochemistry. Human and pig ureteral smooth muscle strips were suspended in tissue baths to determine the effect of the AngII receptor antagonist losartan on the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous ureteral contractions. Electrical field stimulation was performed before and after exposure to losartan.", 
    "413": "Angiotensinogen, renin, angiotensin-converting enzyme and angiotensin receptor subtype 1 mRNA expression was detected in human ureter. Immunoreactivity for AngII was demonstrated in smooth muscle bundles and blood vessels of the ureter. Losartan decreased the amplitude and frequency of spontaneous ureteral contractions as well as the contractile response to electrical field stimulation in a dose dependent manner.", 
    "414": "Gene expression of AngII precursors and receptor, and localization of AngII in the ureter suggest the presence of a local renin-angiotensin system in the ureter. The effect of AngII receptor antagonist on contractile responses suggests that AngII modulates ureteral smooth muscle contractile function. Therefore, a local renin-angiotensin system may have an important role in ureteral function under physiological and pathological conditions.", 
    "415": "Adiponectin, an adipocyte-derived protein, has been suggested to play an important role in insulin sensitivity. We examined the association between insulin sensitivity (M value) evaluated by the euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic glucose clamp and adiponectin concentrations in 30 essential hypertensives (EHT) and 20 normotensives (NT) and investigated the effect of blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) on adiponectin concentrations. EHT were divided into 12 insulin-resistant EHT (EHT-R) and 18 non-insulin-resistant EHT (EHT-N) using mean-1 SD of the M value in NT. There were no intergroup differences in age, gender, and body mass index (BMI). EHT-R had significantly higher levels of insulin and triglyceride and lower levels of adiponectin than did NT and EHT-N. EHT-R had higher levels of free fatty acid and lower levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol than did EHT-N. Adiponectin concentrations were positively correlated with M value and HDL cholesterol and negatively correlated with BMI, insulin, free fatty acid, and triglyceride but not with blood pressure. M value, BMI, and HDL cholesterol were independent determinants of adiponectin concentrations in multiple and stepwise regression analyses. Sixteen EHT were treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (temocapril, 4 mg/d; n=9) or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (candesartan, 8 mg/d; n=7) for 2 weeks. Treatment with temocapril or candesartan significantly decreased blood pressure and increased M value and adiponectin concentrations but did not affect BMI and HDL cholesterol. These results suggest that hypoadiponectinemia is related to insulin resistance in essential hypertension and that RAS blockade increases adiponectin concentrations with improvement in insulin sensitivity.", 
    "416": "In a biomembrane modeling system, reverse micelles, somatic ACE forms dimers via carbohydrate-mediated interaction, providing evidence for the existence of a carbohydrate-recognizing domain on the ACE molecule. We localized this putative region on the N-domain of ACE using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to seven different epitopes of ACE. Two mAbs, 9B9 and 3G8, directed to distinct, but overlapping, epitopes of the N-domain of ACE shielded the CRD. Only \"simple\" ACE-antibody complexes were found in the system. Five mAbs allowed the formation of \"double\" antibody-ACE-ACE-antibody complexes via carbohydrate-mediated interactions. The results were confirmed using the ACE N- and C-domains. Testicular ACE was unable to form carbohydrate-mediated ACE dimers in the reverse micelles, while the N-domain of ACE, obtained by limited proteolysis of the parent full-length ACE, retained the ability to form dimers. Furthermore, mAb 3G8, which blocked ACE dimerization in micelles, significantly inhibited ACE shedding from the surface of ACE-expressing cells. Galactose prevented ACE dimerization in reverse micelles and also affected antibody-induced ACE shedding in an epitope-dependent manner. Restricted glycosylation of somatic ACE, obtained by the treatment of CHO-ACE cells with the glucosidase inhibitor N-butyldeoxynojirimycin, significantly increased the rate of basal ACE shedding and altered antibody-induced ACE shedding. A chemical cross-linking approach was used to show that ACE is present (at least in part) as noncovalently linked dimers on the surface of CHO-ACE cells. These results suggest a possible link between putative ACE dimerization on the cell surface and the proteolytic cleavage (shedding) of ACE.", 
    "417": "Rofecoxib is a commonly used specific cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor. Rofecoxib has high bioavailability, poor aqueous solubility, an elimination half-life suitable for daily administration and a volume of distribution approximating body mass. Species-specific, predominantly hepatic, metabolism occurs, with novel enterohepatic circulation in rats and O-glucuronidation by uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyl transferase (UGT) 2B7 and 2B15 in human liver microsomes. Discrepancies in studies of postoperative analgesia can be putatively explained by known pharmacokinetics. Changes in rofecoxib disposition and pharmacokinetics are evident between races, in elderly patients, in patients with chronic renal insufficiency and in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Despite the selective action of COX-2 inhibitors, there remains the potential for significant drug interactions. Rofecoxib has been shown to have interactions with rifampicin (rifampin), warfarin, lithium and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and theophylline. COX-2 inhibitors represent a major therapeutic advance in terms of gastrointestinal safety; however, long-term safety in other organ systems and with concomitant drug administration still remain to be proven.",

    "419": "54 patients with CCF (NYHA FC II and III) entered the trial. 26 patients received captopril (capoten) in a dose 25-75 mg/day (group 1) while 28 patients were given benazepril (lotensin) in a dose 5-30 mg/day for 4 weeks (group 2). Group II was treated for the following 24 weeks. The results were assessed with electro- and echocardiography, bicycle exercise test, platelet aggregation measurement and by clinical symptoms.", 
    "420": "A positive clinical response was registered to both the drugs which improved the functional class, exercise tolerance, platelet aggregation, reduced the number of arrhythmia and myocardial ischemia episodes. Long-term treatment with lotensin resulted in further improvement of clinical and laboratory indices. Side effects, in which lotensin discontinuation is needed, were absent. Lotensin was more potent than capoten in reducing episodes of ST expression on ECG and episodes of painless myocardial ischemia.", 
    "421": "The concomitant use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and aspirin may cause pharmacological antagonism. Hence we examined the effect of aspirin on the neurohormonal function and hemodynamic response to captopril in heart failure patients. Between April 1999 and August 2000, 40 patients were randomized into four equal groups: 1) captopril, 2) aspirin, 3) captopril-aspirin: captopril was given alone on the first day, followed by aspirin on the remaining days, and 4) aspirin-captopril: aspirin was given alone on the first day, followed by captopril on the remaining days. Hemodynamic, norepinephrine and prostaglandin measurements were performed pre- and post-medication for 4 days. Captopril (50 mg) was given orally every 8 h and 300 mg aspirin was given on the first day, and 100 mg/day thereafter. In the captopril group and only on the first day of captopril-aspirin, captopril produced increases in cardiac index (2.1 +/- 0.6 to 2.5 +/- 0.5 l min-1 m-2, P<0.0001), and reduced peripheral vascular resistance (1980 +/- 580 to 1545 +/- 506 dyn s-1 cm-5/m , P<0.0001) and pulmonary wedge pressure (20 +/- 4 to 15 +/- 4 mmHg, P<0.0001). In contrast, aspirin alone or associated with captopril showed no significant hemodynamic changes. Norepinephrine decreased (P<0.02) only in the captopril group. Prostaglandin levels did not differ significantly among groups. Thus, aspirin compromises the short-term hemodynamic and neurohormonal effects of captopril in patients with acute decompensated heart failure.",

Sixteen patients (group A) were randomized to additionally receive valsartan (40-80 mg/d), and the remaining 16 patients (group B) continued their current regimen. Patients were studied before and 6 mo after treatment. The delayed heart-to-mediastinum count ratio (H/M ratio), delayed total defect score (TDS), and washout rate (WR) were determined from (123)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine images. The left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) and LVEF were determined by echocardiography, and New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class was estimated.", 
    "424": "Before treatment, TDS, H/M ratio, WR, LVEDV, LVEF, and NYHA functional class were similar in both groups.

This benefit is most evident in men. These results may differ from those of the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack (ALLHAT) trial because that study included younger patients, had a greater representation of patients with African ancestry, used different brands of medication, and had a slightly different primary outcome.

    "427": "We report a case of a woman who came to our attention because of hypokalemia, hyperreninemia and hyperaldosteronemia but with normal blood pressure. Under suspicion of a normotensive renal artery stenosis captopril and baseline scintigraphies were performed. Captopril scintigraphy demonstrated a bilateral progressive retention of radiopharmaceutical without significant excretion. The baseline study revealed a complete normalization of the scintigraphyc picture. A Magnetic Resonance Angiography (Angio-MRI) performed to evaluate renal arteries gave completely normal results. On the basis of the clinical picture and imaging findings a diagnosis of Bartter's syndrome was formulated. Renal function in Bartter's syndrome patients is maintained by hyperactivation of the renin angiotensin system. Acute administration of captopril in these patients induces an increase of renal plasma flow whereas it has no effects on glomerular filtration rate thus inducing a decrease of the filtration fraction: post captopril renal scintigraphy of our patient depicted exactly this feature. Although the diagnosis of Bartter's syndrome is based on the clinical picture and biochemical abnormalities, scintigraphic tests could be useful in differentiating Bartter's syndrome from other causes of hypokalemia.",

The OOH option has led to a significant improvement in the quality of life of those patients. However, VADs are still associated with a considerable number of complications. The newly introduced fully implantable system (LionHeart) has reduced significantly the system-related infection complications. Further miniaturization of the systems might reduce the comorbidities and increase the acceptance of this therapeutic option in the management of end-stage cardiac failure.",

Subsequent measurements during the next six years were grouped into two-year periods, averaged, and analyzed for regression of microalbuminuria, which was defined as a 50 percent reduction in urinary albumin excretion from one two-year period to the next.", 
    "435": "Regression of microalbuminuria was frequent, with a six-year cumulative incidence of 58 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 52 to 64 percent). The use of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors was not associated with the regression of microalbuminuria. However, microalbuminuria of short duration, salutary levels of glycosylated hemoglobin (less than 8 percent), low systolic blood pressure (less than 115 mm Hg), and low levels of both cholesterol and triglycerides (less than 198 mg per deciliter [5.12 mmol per liter] and 145 mg per deciliter [1.64 mmol per liter], respectively) were independently associated with the regression of microalbuminuria. Patients with salutary levels of all modifiable factors had a hazard ratio for regression of 3.0 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.5 to 6.0), as compared with patients with no salutary levels of any modifiable factor.", 
    "436": "Frequent regression of microalbuminuria in patients with type 1 diabetes indicates that elevated urinary albumin excretion does not imply inexorably progressive nephropathy.

    "441": "Angiotensin II (Ang II), as a single factor, induces hypertrophy of cultured proximal tubular cells of various species. Cells undergoing hypertrophy are arrested in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Ang II also stimulated the expression of p27Kip1, an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK). Although previous studies inhibiting p27Kip1 expression with antisense oligonucleotides suggested that this CDK inhibitor is important for Ang II-induced hypertrophy of proximal tubular cells, nonspecific effects of antisense technology, and the inability to transfect 100% of cells raised concerns about the true role of p27Kip1 in tubular hypertrophy.", 
    "442": "Proximal tubular cells were isolated and cultured from wild-type (p27Kip1+/+) and knockout (p27Kip1-/-) mice. p27Kip1 genomic and protein expression was evaluated. Proximal tubular cell origin was confirmed by expression of various markers [3M-1 antigen, gamma-glutamyltransferase, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)]. Cell proliferation (cell number, 3[H]thymidine incorporation) and hypertrophy (de novo protein synthesis as measured by 3[H]leucine incorporation, hypertrophy index, cell size) were evaluated. CDK2 and CDK4 activities were determined by an in vitro kinase assay. In addition, cell cycle analysis was performed by flow cytometry. p27Kip1 expression was reconstituted in two different clones of p27Kip1-/- proximal tubular cells using an inducible vector system based on ecdysone response elements.", 
    "443": "In accordance with previous studies, 10-7 mol/L Ang II induces hypertrophy and cell cycle arrest of p27Kip1+/+ proximal tubular cells. In contrast, Ang II facilitated cell cycle progression of two p27Kip1-/- proximal tubular cell lines without inducing hypertrophy. Ang II activates CDK4/cyclin D kinase activity in p27Kip1+/+ and -/- tubular cells, but stimulates CDK2/cyclin E activity only in wild-type cells. However, in the presence of Ang II, reconstituting p27Kip1 expression in p27Kip1-/- tubular cells using an inducible expression system, restored G1 phase arrest and the hypertrophic phenotype. Ang II did not induce apoptosis of either p27Kip1+/+ or -/- tubular cells.", 
    "444": "Our findings are the first clear evidence that p27Kip1 is required for Ang II-induced hypertrophy of proximal tubular cells. However, although p27Kip1 expression is an absolute requirement for this hypertrophy, reconstitution experiments revealed that other factors induced by Ang II contribute to this hypertrophy.",

In those hospitalized with a cardiovascular event, a statin should be started in the hospital, regardless of lipid levels. Patients with diabetes should be treated as if they have preexisting cardiovascular disease.", 
    "446": "There is close relationship between hypertension, organ damage and cardiovascular mortality. The control of hypertension or the regression of organ abnormalities can cause reduction in mortality but this is to be proven by each drug. Similar degree of antihypertensive effect with different type og drugs can result in different amount of regression of left ventricular hypertrophy. Telmisartan can cause reduction of LVH even in small, non-hypotensive doses. Combination of ACE inhibitors and ARB has a lot of theoretical advantage, the available clinical data are positive however some conflicting data are to be clarified yet. The ongoing ONTARGET study will give answers to a lot of this questions in 4 years.",

Both daytime and nighttime blood pressure and short-term blood pressure variability associated with these intermediate and hard cardiovascular outcomes abd should be controlled with antihypertensive treatment. A large increase in blood pressure variability may also occur in the early morning and with some antihypertensive drugs, without a consistent and smooth, more than 24-hour effect. For example, unlike some other angiotensin receptor blockers, telmisartan provides consistent blood pressure reduction for 24-hour, including the critical early morning period.", 
    "448": "The dysfunction of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and its inhibition is a powerful therapeutic tool in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. This system is a very ancient and sensitive mechanism, which reacts very much to the impacts from the environment. The system can be inhibited through four different ways; in the practice ACE inhibitors and ARBs are used mostly. Other--also beneficial--drugs might cause the over stimulation of the system. The inhibition of the RAAS system have significant impact on reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and have been shown convincingly additional benefits comparing to other treatments.", 
    "449": "Landmark studies have demonstrated that diabetes is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease and mortality. Strong relationships exist between insulin resistance/hyperglycemia and mortality, microvascular complications, and cardiovascular complications. Lipid abnormalities frequently associated with type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance include low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and elevated triglyceride levels. Lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels has been shown to improve the prognosis of patients with diabetes, and increasing HDL-C levels will significantly reduce the incidence of major coronary events. Higher levels of insulin sensitivity are associated with thinner intimal-medial thickness of the carotid artery, which indicates less atherosclerosis. Thiazolidinediones increase insulin sensitivity, decrease intimal-medial thickness, and appear to have inhibitory effects on the progression of atherosclerotic lesions. It is hoped that by preventing the onset of diabetes in high-risk individuals--and improving insulin sensitivity with lifestyle changes or pharmacologic treatment--the profound complications of type 2 diabetes will be prevented or delayed, as well.", 
    "450": "The protective effects and roles of AT1-receptor antagonists (AT1-RA) or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) on vascular endothelial cell (EC) injury during hypoxia are not entirely known. Therefore, we investigated these effects and mechanisms in human aortic (HA) EC. DNA fragmentation, Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, and caspase-3 activity were measured in cultured HAEC after exposure to hypoxia in the presence or absence of an AT1-RA (candesartan, CS) and/or an ACEI (temocaprilat, TC). Next, we investigated endothelial cell nitric oxide synthase (ecNOS) and inducible (i) NOS to determine the role of the bradykinin(BK)-NO pathway in the protective effect on ACEI and AT1-RA in the setting of hypoxia-induced apoptosis. Exposure to hypoxia increased DNA fragmentation in HAEC associated with the activation of caspase-3, but did not affect LDH release. In addition, hypoxia induced ecNOS mRNA but not mRNA iNOS. CS and/or TC reduced apoptosis induced by hypoxia in a dose-dependent manner, and significantly increased BK and ecNOS expression. This effect was attenuated by the kinin B2 receptor antagonist, HOE 140, and the NOS inhibitor, N-nitro-L-arginine methylester (L-NMMA). Hypoxia activates the pathway leading to apoptosis by enhancing caspase-3 activity. Both CS and TC can ameliorate hypoxia-induced apoptosis in HAEC through inhibiting caspase-3 activation by enhancing ecNOS activity, via the accumulation of BK.", 
    "451": "Blood pressure reduction and intensive antihypertensive treatment are effective in reducing both microvascular and macrovascular complications in type 2 diabetes. Blood pressure target levels < 130/85 or 130/80 mmHg are now recommended. Antagonism of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system seems to be an important goal in the treatment of hypertension and diabetes-related complications. The renoprotective role of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors has been well documented in type 1 diabetes; in type 2 diabetes ACE-inhibitors have been deemed more effective than other traditional drugs in reducing the onset of overt nephropathy in microalbuminuric patients (secondary prevention) but not in reducing renal dysfunction in patients with clinical proteinuria (tertiary prevention). Recently, four large trials performed on type 2 diabetes showed that angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) prevent the development of clinical proteinuria in microalbuminuric patients (IRMA and MARVAL studies) and delay the progression of nephropathy towards end-stage renal failure in patients with overt nephropathy (IDNT and RENAAL studies). Moreover, ARBs have been deemed more effective in reducing hospitalizations for heart failure compared to placebo (IDNT and RENAAL studies) and in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality compared to conventional therapy (LIFE study) in type 2 diabetes. In conclusion, ARBs are effective in preventing and delaying renal damage in type 2 diabetes. Thus, the recent guidelines for the prevention and treatment of diabetic nephropathy state that ACE-inhibitors are the first-choice drugs in type 1 diabetes while ARBs are considered as the first-choice drugs in secondary prevention, the same as ACE-inhibitors, and are the unique first-choice drug in tertiary prevention of end-stage renal failure in type 2 diabetes. Finally, ACE-inhibitors and ARBs are both first-choice drugs in cardiovascular prevention in type 2 diabetes.", 
    "452": "The prognosis of patients with ischemic heart disease has improved markedly with the introduction of reperfusion therapy and with aggressive efforts to modify risk factors. Consequently, the rate of cardiovascular events after myocardial infarction has decreased to approximately 5% over a period of 2 years as compared with the 20% to 30% reported in the prethrombolytic era. In this context, it is unlikely that the results of previous studies in the prereperfusion era can be applied to this group of patients. Others have demonstrated that the identification of subgroups of patients at greater risk and the search for new risk markers can significantly improve survival of patients who are at high risk despite reperfusion therapy. For example, it was found in the GISSI-2 study that unsuitability for exercise stress testing was associated with a mortality of 7% at 6 months. Other factors that determine poor prognosis after myocardial infarction are transitory heart failure, left ventricular dysfunction, and advanced age. The active search for new risk markers has identified other factors such as nonresolution of ST-segment changes, impaired ventricular filling, anomalous baroreflex sensitivity, or T-wave alternans that may be of benefit in assessing risk. Also, the timing of risk stratification can be critical. Often, risk factors have been analyzed weeks or even months after infarction instead of before hospital discharge. Approximately 30% of patients have deterioration of left ventricular function in the next 2 or 3 months, whereas others have improvement, highlighting the difficulties in attempting to risk stratify at one point in time. Although nobody doubts the effect that coronary revascularization has had on the prognosis of ischemic heart disease or the effectiveness of aspirin, beta -blockers, lipid-lowering drugs, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, the search for cardiac or noncardiac risk markers can contribute notably to increasing the survival of patients who have had myocardial infarction.", 
    "453": "Cardiac natriuretic peptides are a family of structurally related peptides that are important in sodium and volume homeostasis. They consist of atrial natriuretic peptide, brain natriuretic peptide, and C-type natriuretic peptide and are elevated in patients with left ventricular dysfunction. In contrast with vasoconstrictive hormones, such as norepinephrine, angiotensin II, and arginine vasopressin, which worsen the physiological milieu in patients with left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, the natriuretic peptides ameliorate these effects by promoting natriuresis, diuresis, peripheral vasodilation, and by inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system. The serum levels of the natriuretic peptides correlate with the severity of heart failure and appear to have prognostic value. The present article reviews the biochemistry, molecular biology, and physiology of natriuretic peptides and their pathophysiological link to heart failure. The therapeutic uses of natriuretic peptides are also reviewed. This includes the use of intravenous nesiritide, a synthetic human brain natriuretic peptide, and the recently developed vasopeptidase inhibitors which are designed to inhibit the degradation of natriuretic peptides.",

Torsades de Pointes is more common in women related to a longer QT-interval. Lower dose OCPs decrease the risk of MI, stroke and thrombosis. HRTs are not effective for CAD prevention.", 
    "455": "An increased risk of thrombembolic events in congestive heart failure (CHF) has been attributed to a hypercoagulable state including vascular endothelial dysfunction and platelet activation. After experimental myocardial infarction, male Wistar rats were treated with placebo, the ACE inhibitor trandolapril, the selective aldosterone receptor antagonist eplerenone or the combination of both, for 10 weeks. Platelet-bound fibrinogen and surface-expressed P-selectin were not modulated in rats without CHF compared with sham-operated animals, but were significantly increased in CHF rats (LVEDP>15 mmHg). In CHF rats, ACE inhibition significantly reduced platelet P-selectin expression while bound fibrinogen was not modulated. Eplerenone reduced P-selectin expression to a comparable extent, while platelet-bound fibrinogen was normalised. Combination therapy with eplerenone and trandolapril completely abolished both the increased P-selectin expression as well as fibrinogen binding. Phosphorylation of platelet vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) at both Ser(157) and Ser(239), which reflects the activity of platelet inhibitors including nitric oxide, was significantly reduced in platelets from placebo-treated CHF rats, and was completely normalised by combination treatment, but only marginally increased by either mono-therapy. The results show that platelet activation was evident only in CHF rats. Monotherapy with ACE inhibition or eplerenone partially reduced this increased platelet activation, which was completely rescued to basal levels by combination therapy. Increased nitric oxide bioavailability can only partially explain the reduced platelet activation by eplerenone and ACE inhibition.", 
    "456": "Several medical therapies, including digoxin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and beta-blockers, have reduced the number of re-hospitalizations and slowed the progression of congestive heart failure (CHF) improving survival. Despite these benefits, medical therapy frequently fails to improve quality of life. Since 1990, there has been a growing interest in using cardiac pacing as additional treatment in severe CHF. Biventricular pacing is used in CHF patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB) to improve ventricular activation sequence which may lead to a more coordinated and efficient ventricular contraction. Since its introduction in CHF in 1994, biventricular pacing has been widely applied with many clinical trials and the development of new specific technology. With the development of new technology, the left ventricular catheterization via a coronary sinus vein, increased from 56% to over 95% during the last 2 years with an acceptable number of complications. Despite encouraging acute and short-term results, pacing strategies for CHF are still limited and currently regarded as investigational. It is clear that while some patients respond remarkably, this is high variable. Clinical trials are currently underway to assess the impact of cardiac resynchronization therapy on morbi-mortality and to assess the association with ventricular defibrillation. The whole validation process of cardiac resynchronization therapy should be completed on 2004-2005. Another novel mode of pacing therapy, which may be clinically appropriate for a broader range of CHF patients irrespective of the presence of LBBB, is contractility modulation, which involves sub-threshold pacing to increase intracellular calcium and enhance inotropy.", 
    "457": "Although the role of the systemic renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in the pathophysiology of heart failure is well-known for years, the impact of a local cardiac aldosterone system has been recognized recently. Aldosterone promotes cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in hypertension and heart failure and is involved in left ventricular remodeling after myocardial infarction. Plasma aldosterone levels in patients with heart failure are an indicator of a worse prognosis. Although ACE inhibitor therapy in these patients reduces plasma aldosterone levels, this effect is only transitory, a phenomenon referred to as \"aldosterone escape\". Even maximally recommended doses of ACE inhibitors do not completely prevent ACE-mediated formation of angiotensin II in chronic heart failure, and those patients with increased aldosterone levels during ACE inhibition have impaired exercise capacity. The RALES study has demonstrated convincingly that in patients with heart failure, addition of the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist spironolactone (25 mg/d) to ACE inhibition markedly reduces mortality and prevents worsening heart failure. While reduction of excessive extracellular matrix turnover leading to decreased fibrosis appears to be the most important effect of spironolactone in heart failure, other mechanisms such as regression of hypertrophy, improvement of endothelial function, enhanced renal sodium excretion and antiarrhythmic actions may contribute. In RALES, low-dose spironolactone did not confer a substantial risk of hyperkalemia, however, with broader use of spironolactone in heart failure, cases of hyperkalemia associated with the use of this drug increase. Close control of serum potassium and creatinine and estimation of creatinine clearance are mandatory, especially in the presence of additional factors impairing renal function. The new and more selective aldosterone antagonist eplerenone which is devoid of some side effects of spironolactone, has been shown to be effective in hypertension and holds great promise as future therapeutic agent in patients with heart failure.", 
    "458": "In recent years, it has become increasingly recognised that a central feature of the disease progression associated with heart failure is the process of left ventricular remodeling. The remodeling process manifests as an increase in left ventricular volumes, leading to a rise in wall stress and a compensatory increase in myocardial mass. The left ventricle also gradually assumes a more spherical shape, resulting in functional mitral regurgitation leading to further haemodynamic overload, worsening myocardial function and an unfavourable clinical course. Accumulating clinical data support the hypothesis that the benefits in clinical outcome with ACE-inhibitors and beta-blockers may relate to modification of the remodeling process resulting in slowing of disease progression and preservation of contractile function. The general trend from a number of clinical studies indicates that whereas ACE-inhibitors seem to prevent progressive left ventricular dilatation, the third generation beta-blocker, carvedilol, may actually reverse the remodelling process by reducing left ventricular volumes and improving systolic function. Direct comparisons indicate that carvedilol has a similar safety and tolerability profile to ACE-inhibitors and thereby support the feasibility of administering this drug as first-line therapy in selected patients with mild to moderate chronic heart failure. Therefore, the decision to initiate treatment with carvedilol or an ACE-inhibitor might in future be tailored on an individual basis and followed thereafter by combination therapy at the earliest and safest opportunity. Finally, the possible development of treatment strategies addressing the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for the remodeling process and the recently published benefits of device therapies herald a combined, synergistic approach to the future management of heart failure.", 
    "459": "The effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril (EPL) (2 and 4 mg/kg), angiotensin (AT) II receptor antagonist losartan (LRN) (5 and 10 mg/kg), and anxiolytic drug diazepam (DZP) (0.5 mg/kg) on anxiety parameters were evaluated in experimentally induced renal hypertensive rats (RHR). Renal hypertension was induced in Wistar strain male albino rats weighing 200-250 g by following the method of Goldblatt. The animals having systolic blood pressure more than 180-210 mm Hg were subjected to open-field exploratory behaviour, elevated plus maze behaviour, and social interaction tests of anxiety. The RHR showed hyperactivity in open-field behaviour and anxiogenicity in elevated plus maze and social interaction tests. Losartan (5 and 10 mg/kg) and DZP (0.5 mg/kg) significantly attenuated the hyperactivity and anxiogenic behaviour in experimentally induced hypertensive rats and induced anxiolysis in normotensive rats (NTR). Enalapril reversed the hypertension-induced alteration only at higher dose (4 mg/kg) and failed to show any effect in NTR. It can be concluded that renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) has a significant role on behaviour, and LRN has shown better effect in reversing the hyperactivity and anxiogenicity in the experimentally induced hypertensive rats, indicating a possible role of AT receptor in the mediation of anxiolysis.", 
    "460": "The renin-angiotensin system evolved to maintain volume homeostasis and blood pressure and to prevent ischemia during acute volume loss. But in the present age, these mechanisms are redundant, and the clinical significance of angiotensin II results from its pathologic effects, which are mediated by the angiotensin II type 1 (AT(1)) receptor. Activation of AT(1) receptors has been linked to pathologic processes that contribute to atherosclerosis and ischemic events, including oxidative stress, inflammatory processes, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol trafficking, and prothrombotic states. The Ongoing Telmisartan Alone and in Combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET) program will compare the efficacy of the angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) telmisartan, the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor ramipril, and combination therapy with telmisartan plus ramipril for reducing cardiovascular risk. The ARB telmisartan is distinguished by its long duration of action, which compares favorably with some other ARBs and conventional antihypertensives. Ramipril was shown in the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) study to reduce the risk for myocardial infarction (MI) and other cardiovascular events in patients at high risk for cardiovascular events but without heart failure or a low ejection fraction. The ONTARGET program consists of 2 randomized, double-blind, multicenter international trials: a principal trial, ONTARGET, and a parallel trial, Telmisartan Randomized Assessment Study in ACE-I Intolerant Patients with Cardiovascular Disease (TRANSCEND). The treatment arms for the principal ONTARGET study are telmisartan 80 mg, ramipril 10 mg, and combination therapy with telmisartan 80 mg plus ramipril 10 mg; for the parallel study TRANSCEND, the treatment arms are telmisartan 80 mg and placebo. Both trials will assess cardiovascular outcomes in patients at high risk using the same criteria as that of the HOPE study, with a single exception: the TRANSCEND trial will enroll patients who do not tolerate ACE inhibitor treatment. The primary end points in both ONTARGET and TRANSCEND are death caused by cardiovascular disease, acute MI, stroke, and hospitalization because of congestive heart failure. The secondary end points include newly diagnosed heart failure, revascularization, new-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus, nephropathy, cognitive decrease and dementia, and newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation; these will be used for hypothesis generation.", 
    "461": "Costs of providing a particular medical service can be measured, but it is more difficult to assess whether the service provides good value for the money spent. Rigorous trials have demonstrated the health benefits connected with interventions for treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD), and in-depth analyses of the costs associated with many of those interventions have been performed. Careful use of terminology clearly differentiating among cost-minimization (relative costs of proved equivalent therapeutics), cost-effectiveness (lives saved or years of life added), and cost-benefit (total net effect in monetary terms) analyses is warranted. Although trials commonly assess clinical effectiveness as reductions in mortality or CVD-specific outcomes, improvement in quality of life may be equally important and is expressed in quality-adjusted life-years. Comparisons between therapies can be assessed as a cost-effectiveness ratio. Extensive cost-effectiveness studies have been conducted on many important cardiovascular therapies: (1) beta-blockers and diuretics for multiple CVD outcomes, mortality, and prevention of recurrent myocardial infarction (MI); (2) statins for both primary and secondary prevention of CVD; (3) enalapril for prevention and treatment of congestive heart failure; (4) tissue plasminogen activator treatment of acute MI; (5) coronary artery bypass graft for left main, single-, and 2-vessel coronary artery disease, or severe angina; (6) physician counseling for smoking; and (7) radiofrequency ablation therapy for Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Therapies considered economically attractive include (1) secondary prevention with statins in hyperlipidemia, (2) smoking cessation programs, (3) primary prevention in treatment of high blood pressure with diuretics and beta-blockers, (4) primary prevention with regular exercise programs, (5) secondary prevention with cardiac rehabilitation, and (6) postinfarction treatment with beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. A recent cost-minimization analysis has been performed showing aspirin to be a \"best buy\" therapy for secondary prevention of CVD. The Ongoing Telmisartan Alone and in Combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET) and Telmisartan Randomized Assessment Study in ACE-I Intolerant Patients with Cardiovascular Disease (TRANSCEND) program provide potential opportunities for both cost-minimization and cost-effectiveness analyses.", 
    "462": "In this article, 2 leading physicians debate the strength of outcome data on the efficacy of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors versus angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) for reducing the incidence of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and renovascular events. Dr. Stephen G. Ball notes that the efficacy of ACE inhibitors for reducing the risk for myocardial infarction independent of their effects on blood pressure is controversial. In the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) study, ramipril treatment in high-risk patients was associated with a 20% reduction in the risk for myocardial infarction; mean reduction in blood pressure was 3 mm Hg for systolic blood pressure and 1 mm Hg for diastolic blood pressure. The HOPE investigators propose that the 20% reduction was much greater than would be expected based on the observed blood pressure reduction. However, a meta-regression analysis of blood pressure reduction in >20 antihypertensive therapy outcome trials found that the reduction in myocardial infarction risk with ramipril observed in HOPE was consistent with the modest blood pressure reduction seen with that agent. Nevertheless, there are convincing data for prevention of myocardial infarction with ACE inhibitors in patients with heart failure, including those with heart failure after myocardial infarction, as well as supportive evidence from studies in patients with diabetes mellitus and concomitant hypertension. On the other hand, Dr. William B. White takes the position that ARBs are well-tolerated antihypertensive agents that specifically antagonize the angiotensin II type 1 (AT(1)) receptor and provide a more complete block of the pathologic effects of angiotensin II-which are mediated via the AT(1) receptor-than ACE inhibitors. The Evaluation of Losartan in the Elderly (ELITE) II study and the Valsartan Heart Failure Trial (ValHeFT) suggest that ARBs reduce the risk for mortality in patients with congestive heart failure. The Losartan Intervention for Endpoint (LIFE) Reduction in Hypertension trial also demonstrated beneficial effects of ARBs in the prevention of stroke events. The Irbesartan in Patients with Diabetes and Microalbuminuria (IRMA) study, the Irbesartan Diabetic Nephropathy Trial (IDNT), and the Reduction of Endpoints in NIDDM with the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan (RENAAL) study demonstrated significant reductions in the rate of progression of renal disease in patients receiving ARBs, independent of effects on blood pressure. These data support the use of ARBs, in addition to the standard of care, in hypertensive patients with heart failure who are intolerant of ACE inhibitors, and also provide compelling evidence for their use in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes.", 
    "463": "The risk of stroke is strongly and persistently related to the usual level of both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). This relation holds for primary and secondary stroke, both ischemic and hemorrhagic. The Perindopril Protection Against Recurrent Stroke Study (PROGRESS) has now provided definitive evidence that lowering the blood pressure of patients with preexisting cerebrovascular disease (prior stroke or transient ischemic attack [TIA]) also reduces the incidence of secondary stroke. PROGRESS showed that a flexible blood pressure-lowering regimen involving an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (perindopril) and a diuretic (indapamide) reduces the incidence of stroke, major coronary events, and major vascular events by 28%, 26%, and 26%, respectively. These benefits were associated with an average reduction of 9.0 mm Hg (SBP) and 4.0 mm Hg (DBP). The 28% reduction in stroke incidence translated into a 24% reduction in ischemic stroke and a 50% reduction in hemorrhagic stroke. Combination therapy with perindopril and indapamide decreased blood pressure more effectively than did perindopril monotherapy (mean reduction of 12.3 mm Hg [SBP] and 5.0 mm Hg [DBP] vs 4.9 mm Hg [SBP] and 2.8 mm Hg [DBP], respectively) and was equally effective in reducing stroke risk in patients with and without hypertension. In conclusion, blood pressure-lowering therapy is now established as the most important measure for primary and secondary stroke prevention. Results of PROGRESS suggest that antihypertensive treatment with a combination of perindopril plus indapamide should now be routinely considered for all patients with previous stroke or TIA.", 
    "464": "Clinical trials have demonstrated that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta-blockers, and spironolactone improve survival in patients with heart failure. Because patients with heart failure and renal insufficiency have been underrepresented in these trials, little evidence is available to guide clinicians in the optimal management of patients with both conditions. Approximately one third to one half of patients with heart failure have renal insufficiency (estimated glomerular filtration rate [GFR] <60 mL/min per 1.73 m2), and renal insufficiency is among the strongest predictors of mortality in patients with heart failure. Evidence supports the use of ACE inhibitors to improve survival in patients with moderate renal insufficiency (GFR, 30 to 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2), but there is little evidence with which to weigh the risks and benefits in patients with more advanced renal dysfunction. beta-Blockers improve survival in patients with heart failure, and their beneficial effect is unlikely to differ according to renal function. Spironolactone improves outcomes in patients with advanced heart failure, but renal insufficiency appears to increase risk for hyperkalemia and limits the use of the drug in patients with severe renal insufficiency. Future clinical trials in heart failure should include a representative number of patients with renal insufficiency to improve the evidence base and outcomes in this vulnerable population.", 
    "465": "Congestive heart failure is a progressive disorder that is frequently preceded by asymptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction. We reviewed the epidemiology, diagnosis, and natural history of asymptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction and evaluated community-wide screening for this condition as a potential strategy to reduce the incidence of heart failure. Asymptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction has an estimated prevalence of 3% to 6%, and is at least as common in the community as systolic heart failure. Because it often occurs in the absence of known cardiovascular disease, this condition may go unrecognized and undertreated. In randomized trials, individuals with asymptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction have high rates of incident heart failure and death. However, little is known about the prognosis of individuals with this condition in the community, who have a substantially lower prevalence of myocardial infarction, have milder degrees of systolic dysfunction, and are older than patients enrolled in clinical trials. Current evidence is inadequate to support community-wide screening for asymptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction, either with echocardiography or with assays for natriuretic peptides. Given the increasing prevalence of heart failure, additional studies are needed to develop effective strategies to detect and optimally manage individuals with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction in the community.",

AM precursor is converted to inactive glycine-extended AM (AM-Gly) and subsequently AM-Gly is converted to active mature AM (AM-m) by enzymatic amidation. We measured AM-m, AM-total (AM-T; AM-T = AM-m + AM-Gly), and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) in the plasma and left ventricle (LV) by immunoradiometric assay. We also measured gene expression of AM and ANP was and gene expression and protein levels of AM receptor system components such as calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR), receptor-activity modifying protein (RAMP) 2 and RAMP3.",

AM-m and AM-T levels in plasma (AM-m: + 31%; AM-T: + 56%) and the LV (AM-m: + 84%; AM-T: + 31%) were significantly higher in SHR-SP than in WKY. The LV tissue AM-m/AM-T ratio was significantly higher in SHR-SP (93.2%) than in WKY. The mRNA levels of AM, CRLR, and RAMP2 in the LV were significantly higher in SHR-SP than in WKY.

    "478": "Differences in achieved systolic blood pressure and incidence of total and cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular events, stroke, myocardial infarction and heart failure. NEW VERSUS OLD DRUGS: In 15 trials, 120 574 hypertensive patients were randomized to old drugs (diuretics or beta-blockers) or new agents [calcium-channel blockers, alpha-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin type-1 receptor (AR1) blockers]. Old and new drugs provided similar protection against total and cardiovascular mortality and fatal plus non-fatal myocardial infarction. Calcium-channel blockers, including (-8%, P = 0.07) or excluding verapamil (-10%, P = 0.02), as well as AR1 blockers (-24%, P = 0.0002) resulted in better stroke prevention than did the old drugs, whereas the opposite trend was observed for ACE inhibitors (+10%, P = 0.03). The risk of heart failure was higher (P < 0.0001) on calcium-channel blockers (+33%) and alpha-blockers (+102%) than on conventional therapy involving diuretics. META-REGRESSION: Between-group differences in achieved systolic pressure ranged from 0.1 to 3.2 mmHg in seven actively controlled trials (73 237 patients), and from 2.1 to 22.1 mmHg in seven studies comparing varying intensities of blood pressure lowering (11 128 patients). For these 14 new trials, we predicted outcome from achieved systolic blood pressure using our previously published meta-regression models based on 30 trials with 149 407 patients. In general, predicted and observed odds ratios were similar. Larger reductions in systolic pressure (weighted mean 1.8 mmHg) in two trials accounted for the advantage of AR1 blockers over conventional therapy in the prevention of stroke. Only for cardiovascular mortality in very old patients (P = 0.02) and for cardiovascular events and myocardial infarction in old Australians (P < 0.05), the observed odds ratios deviated from our predictions based on the gradients in systolic blood pressure.", 
    "479": "The hypothesis that new antihypertensive drugs, such as calcium-channel blockers, alpha-blockers, ACE inhibitors or AR1 blockers might influence cardiovascular prognosis over and beyond their antihypertensive effects remains unproven. The finding that blood pressure differences largely accounted for cardiovascular outcome emphasizes the desirability of tight blood pressure control. However, the level to which blood pressure must be lowered to achieve maximal benefit remains currently unknown.", 
    "480": "A transient (Ipeak) and a sustained (Isus) outward K+ current were measured, using whole-cell voltage-clamp methods, in isolated rat ventricular myocytes obtained by enzymatic dispersion. A comparison was made between male and female rats following induction of (insulin-deficient) diabetes with streptozotocin (STZ). In control (non-diabetic) rats, both currents were smaller in cells obtained from females, as compared to males (P<0.005). However, whereas inducing diabetes in male rats significantly attenuated both Ipeak and Isus (P<0.005), Ipeak was unchanged in female diabetic rats. Isus was significantly (P<0.005) reduced, but the extent of reduction was smaller (P<0.02) than in males. The formation of angiotensin II (ATII) or endothelin-1 (ET-1) was blocked using inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE), respectively. In cells from diabetic males both inhibitors significantly (P<0.005) enhanced K+ currents. In contrast, no effect was observed in cells from female diabetic rats. However, in ovariectomized (Ovx) diabetic females the in vitro inhibition of ATII and ET-1 formation augmented the two K+ currents, but not when oestradiol was administered in vivo prior to cell isolation. In cells from diabetic males, incubation with 100 nM 17beta-oestradiol significantly (P<0.005) enhanced both Ipeak and Isus. This effect was blocked if ATII or ET-1 was added to the medium. These results show that autocrine modulation of K+ currents by renin-angiotensin and endothelin systems is attenuated or absent in female diabetic rats. Oestradiol plays a key role in reducing this modulation. These results may underlie some of the sex differences associated with development of cardiac arrhythmias.",

This paper reviews the evidence we have obtained by measuring distensibility through quantification of changes in arterial diameter vs blood pressure changes at large elastic and middle size muscle artery sites. Evidence shows that arterial distensibility is reduced in conditions such as hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, diabetes, and congestive heart failure. In some conditions (e.g. hypertension) the alterations are not uniformly distributed in the arteries of different structure and size whereas in others (e.g. diabetes and heart failure) they are widespread. In diabetes evidence is available that distensibility changes occur early in the course of the disease. Evidence is also available that in all above conditions treatment can improve arterial distensibility thereby reversing the initial abnormality. This is due to a variable combination of structural and functional factors. However, technical ability to determine their precise role in distensibility changes in humans is limited.",

Quinaprilat (100 microg/kg/h or 300 microg/kg/h for 70 min, IV) was administered 20 min before ischemia with or without pretreatment with Nomega-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME) (10 mg/kg, IV, a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor), 5-hydroxydecanoic acid sodium salt (5-HD) or posttreatment with 5-HD (5 mg/kg, IV, a mitochondrial KATP channel blocker). The area at risk as a percentage of the left ventricle was determined by Evans blue dye and the infarct size was determined as a percent of the area at risk by triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining. Using a microdialysis technique, myocardial interstitial levels of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,5-DHBA), an indicator of hydroxyl radicals, and NOx, an indicator of nitric oxide, were measured before, during, and after 30 min of ischemia. Quinaprilat significantly reduced the infarct size in a dose-dependent manner (30.1 +/- 3%, n = 10, and 27.6 +/- 2%, n = 7, respectively) compared with the control (46.5 +/- 4%, n = 10). The infarct size-reducing effect of quinaprilat was completely blocked by pretreatment with l-NAME (43.8 +/- 2%, n = 8) and 5-HD (50.1 +/- 3%, n = 8) and posttreatment with 5-HD (50.3 +/- 2%, n = 8), respectively. Quinaprilat did not affect the myocardial interstitial 2,5-DHBA level but significantly increased the NOx level during ischemia and reperfusion. Quinaprilat reduces myocardial infarct size involving NO production and mitochondrial KATP channels in rabbits without collateral circulation.", 
    "492": "Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury involves necrosis and apoptosis. The inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) has been reported to suppress infarct size. In this study, it was investigated whether an ACE inhibitor affected myocardial apoptosis and apoptosis-related proteins in rats with experimental myocardial infarction. Anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups. Group I underwent 30 minutes of left coronary artery occlusion followed by 24 hours of reperfusion (control group); Group II underwent oral administration of the ACE inhibitor quinapril (10 mg/kg/day) before coronary occlusion (quinapril group); Group III underwent administration of the bradykinin B(2)-receptor antagonist Hoe 140 (250 microg/kg/day, subcutaneously) with quinapril (quinapril + Hoe 140 group); and Group IV underwent administration of Hoe 140 alone (Hoe 140 group). After reperfusion, myocardial infarct size was determined by triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining. Myocardial apoptosis was detected immunohistologically using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling staining and DNA electrophoresis. Myocardial caspase-3 activation was analyzed by Western blot and the expressions of Bcl-xL and Bax proteins were detected immunohistochemically. Quinapril significantly reduced the ratio of myocardial infarct size in the ischemic area at risk. In addition, quinapril significantly suppressed the incidence of apoptotic myocytes around the necrotic region (from 18.9 +/- 0.8% to 8.6 +/- 1.0%; P < 0.0001), the intensity of DNA ladder formation, and the activation of caspase-3. Hoe 140 attenuated these protective effects of quinapril. In the immunohistochemical study, Bax and Bcl-xL were expressed in myocytes, and ischemia-reperfusion abolished both proteins in the center region of ischemia. The Bax staining was equally observed among all groups. However, Bcl-xL staining remained in the ischemic area widely after quinapril treatment. In addition, Hoe 140 also depleted this effect of quinapril. These results suggest that inhibition of ACE reduces myocardial infarction and apoptosis via the bradykinin B(2) receptor in part. The antiapoptotic effect of the ACE inhibitor is attributed to the changing expression of Bcl-xL.",

Twenty-six spontaneously rats with hypertensive heart failure were treated with either placebo (CON), SPIRO (20 mg/kg/d by mouth), CAP (100 mg/kg/d by mouth), or both SPIRO and CAP for 12 weeks. This dose of oral SPIRO did not affect blood pressure, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, left ventricular ejection fraction, plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentration, or cardiac fibrosis; however, in combination with CAP, it exerted a significant depressor effect after 12 weeks of treatment that was accompanied by increased urine output and decreased urinary protein excretion. These effects were significantly greater than those with CAP treatment alone. A significant increase in plasma aldosterone level was observed only in CON (174 +/- 21%). These data suggest that the addition of low-dose SPIRO to angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor treatment may prevent progression into end-stage congestive heart failure through synergistic effects on diuresis and renoprotection.",

    "498": "Complete ureteral obstruction in rats rapidly leads to renal interstitial expansion and fibrosis and this process is ameliorated by concomitant angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition (ACEI). However, models of intervention initiated after unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) release may be more analogous to human obstructive renal disease where treatment could more reasonably follow the discovery of obstructive uropathy as compared to models where treatment is initiated at the time of experimentally induced obstruction. We studied interstitial changes in rats before and after release of UUO and examined the effect of ACEI with 200mg/L of enalapril (E) in the drinking water on these changes. Rats were sacrificed after 10 (n=10) and 20 (n=10) days (D) of UUO or 10D after release of 10D of UUO (n=18). Eleven rats received E for 10D after UUO release. Cortical interstitial volume fraction [Vv(I/C)] measured by point counting was increased at 10D (0.32 +/- 0.05) and 20D (0.41 +/- 0.05) of UUO compared to contralateral and sham-operated kidneys (both 0.05 +/- 0.01, ANOVA, p <0.001). Vv(I/C) 10D after release from 10D of UUO (0.26 +/- 0.04) was lower than that of 10D of UUO (p<0.05) and much lower than those with 20D of UUO (p<0.001). However, rats treated with E from the time of UUO release had lower Vv(I/C) (0.21 +/- 0.07) than UUO released E untreated rats (p<0.05). Release of UUO initiates regression of interstitial expansion in rats. ACEI with enalapril significantly accelerates reversal of interstitial expansion after UUO release. This could have important implications for treatment of obstructive nephropathy in humans.",

    "529": "Insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia are the critical characteristics of the metabolic syndrome that is associated with abdominal obesity and are the early manifestations of its progression to type 2 diabetes. These metabolic abnormalities are becoming recognized as a major contributor to cardiovascular disease. The experimental studies required to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and to develop effective preventative strategies will require the use of appropriate animal models and these are available. The evidence from such research indicates that a wide range of interventions (including peroxisome proliferator activator receptor agonists, insulin-sensitizing agents, statins, fibrates, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, estrogen receptor modulators, lipid-based nutriceuticals, and ethanol) can markedly reduce or prevent vasculopathy and ischemic cardiac lesions in animal models. Overall, the results suggest that early damage to the vascular wall, both in function and presenting as atherosclerotic lesions, is secondary to long-term hyperinsulinemia and, especially, to postprandial peaks in plasma insulin levels, and is exacerbated by the accompanying hyperlipidemia. Effective treatment will, of necessity, be preventative and will necessitate diagnostic approaches that can identify asymptomatic individuals at high risk for vascular damage and eventual progression to type 2 diabetes. Therapeutic targets in this population include insulin sensitivity and the associated signal transduction pathways, the peroxisome proliferator activator receptor-alpha and -gamma systems, and the complex pathways leading from acetyl CoA and the citric acid cycle to the synthesis of fatty acid and the storage of triglyceride. These pharmacological approaches offer the prospect of preventing a significant proportion of cardiovascular disease.", 
    "530": "In renal transplantation, chronic renal transplant failure (CRTF) is the principal cause of late graft loss. Both immunological and non-immunological factors play a role in the pathogenesis of CRTF. However, CRTF is unresponsive to immunosuppressive therapy. In several kidney diseases, inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has shown to reduce the rate of progression of renal disease more effectively than conventional antihypertensive drugs. Therefore, RAS blockade may be of benefit in the treatment of CRTF. Several short-term studies in human renal transplant recipients showed that RAS blockade had a beneficial effect on renal transplant function, blood pressure and proteinuria. Despite these benefits physicians remain reluctant to use ACE inhibition in these recipients, because of fear of functional decrease in renal perfusion, especially in the setting of renal transplant artery stenosis. To study the long-term effects of RAS blockade we used the established Fisher to Lewis (F-L) model for CRTF, which mirrors the progressive changes seen in humans. Studies in our lab and by others showed that RAS blockade in the F-L model prevents proteinuria, glomerulosclerosis and hypertension. However, when treated for 34 weeks with RAS blockade, renal arteries developed severe intimal hyperplasia. This effect was specific for Fisher rats. Syngrafted Fisher rats treated with ACE inhibition developed intimal hyperplasia, but allografting significantly aggravated it. Fisher rats have a four times higher renal ACE activity, compared with the Lewis rat. This is comparable to the human DD/II genotype differences in ACE activity. Renal transplant patients with the DD genotype may be more vulnerable for vascular changes when treated with RAS blockade.",

By their nature, they are outdated considering the rapid and efficient publication of many papers related to the treatment of hypertension in diabetes. Increased blood glucose causes vascular damage and abnormal vascular structure all over the body, an abnormal structure that is especially vulnerable to high blood pressure, even within the so-called normal range. There is now more and more evidence, especially in diabetics, that blood pressure should be as low as possible. In this context, it is important to stress that the so-called J-shaped relationship between blood pressure and mortality may not be so relevant. Major epidemiological studies came from the Framingham and the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT) Diabetic Cohort. The MRFIT Cohort showed that cardiovascular mortality was increased by a factor of 2-4 in diabetic patients, and there was a clear association between systolic blood pressure and complications without any threshold value. It could be suggested that since diabetes is an important cardiovascular risk factor, a lower value (130/85 mmHg) than for non-diabetics (140/90 mmHg) should be proposed. The tight blood pressure control arm of the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study was <150/85 mmHg (achieved 144/82 mmHg) and the aim in the less tight control arm was <180/105 mmHg (achieved 154/87 mmHg). In the tight control group, 29% needed three or more antihypertensive drugs. In the Hypertension Optimal Treatment study, the frequency of major cardiovascular disease events in the group with target <80 mmHg (achieved 144/81 mmHg) was 11.9/1000 patients/year, which was significantly lower than the event rate (24.4/1000 patients/year) in the group with target <90 mmHg (achieved 148/85 mmHg). A reduction in the frequency of diabetic nephropathy by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor treatment in normotensive lean microalbuminuric type 2 diabetic patients has been shown. However, it is impossible from the present data to draw any conclusions with respect to effect on the main composite endpoint of ACE inhibition in microalbuminuric type 2 diabetic patients without previous cardiovascular events or without hypertension. Recent published studies have also demonstrated beneficial effects with angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy. Diuretics form a very important basis for antihypertensive treatment, also often in combination with agents that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system. Several studies show that treatment with the diuretic indapamide reduces the level of microalbuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes. Diuretics were used as an adjunctive to reduce blood pressure in all studies; it is therefore understandable that many guidelines suggest that diuretics form part of the treatment of hypertension in diabetics. Many studies of an epidemiological nature and follow-up studies in diabetic patients show that blood pressure control is of vital concern in the prevention of diabetic complications, and indeed the usual criteria for good blood pressure control may not be stringent enough in diabetic patients. Many classes of antihypertensives may be used, but it appears that diuretics, such as indapamide sustained release (SR), constitute an important proposal in all treatment strategies.", 
    "537": "In type 2 diabetic hypertensive patients, microalbuminuria can be due to hypertension and/or diabetic nephropathy. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors act preferentially on microalbuminuria due to diabetic nephropathy. The objective is to demonstrate the efficacy of a thiazide-like diuretic, indapamide sustained release (SR), at reducing microalbuminuria in hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients in comparison with an ACE inhibitor, enalapril. The study is an international multicentre, 12-month, randomized, double-blind, controlled, two parallel group study of type 2 diabetic patients with hypertension (140 mmHg < or = systolic blood pressure <180 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure <110 mmHg) and microalbuminuria.

An additional label treatment by amlodipine 5-10 mg (1st step) and atenolol 50-100 mg (2nd step) a day is permitted after 6 weeks of treatment based upon blood pressure response. The main outcome measures are microalbuminuria expressed as urinary albumin to creatinine ratio, albumin fractional clearance, and albumin excretion rate evaluated on overnight urine collections. Secondary criteria are supine and standing systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressure; and biological and clinical safety. This study will complete the knowledge of the efficacy of indapamide SR in hypertension and target organ damage and will provide valuable information on the management of type 2 diabetic hypertensives with microalbuminuria.", 
    "538": "Microalbuminuria (defined as an albumin-creatinine ratio of 10-25 mg/mmol on the first-morning urine sample, or an albumin excretion rate of 20-200 microg/min on a timed collection) is present in 20-30% of all patients with type 2 diabetes, and is especially common in those with hypertension, endothelial dysfunction and other features of insulin resistance. Although microalbuminuria is predictive of worsening microvascular disease in the kidney (5-10% per year progress to overt diabetic nephropathy), an increased albumin excretion rate (AER) reflects a generalized abnormality of vascular function and is associated with 2-4-fold increases in cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. The extent to which microalbuminuria is a risk factor independent of other variables in type 2 diabetes, e.g. blood pressure and smoking, has been highlighted by recent cohort studies, e.g. the Heart Outcome Prevention Evaluation study and the Wisconsin Epidemiological Study of Diabetic Retinopathy. In the former study, for example, microalbuminuria at baseline increased the adjusted relative risks (RR) of a major cardiovascular event (RR 1.83), all-cause death (RR 2.09) and hospitalization for heart failure (RR 3.23) in both diabetic and non-diabetic subjects. These studies also highlighted that AER is a continuous risk factor, and that levels of AER below the arbitrary threshold for defining microalbuminuria are associated with relatively increased cardiovascular risk. Similarly, microalbuminuria affects 10-15% of middle-aged non-diabetics and is associated with coronary, peripheral and cerebral vascular complications. Detection of microalbuminuria, especially in type 2 diabetes, signifies the need to intensify blood pressure control as part of a multiple risk factor intervention strategy in a high-risk group. As hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes are frequently treated by more than one antihypertensive agent, ACE inhibitors and low-dose diuretics are preferably recommended in order to provide sufficient blood pressure control and target organ protection.",

Its expression is essential for normal vasculogenesis. Down-regulation of RECK has been implicated in tumor angiogenesis and progression.", 
    "541": "The authors assessed the prognostic value of RECK expression in tumor tissue specimens from 278 breast carcinoma patients with a median follow-up time of 75 months (range, 2-169 months). RECK mRNA levels were measured by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction.", 
    "542": "Expression levels of RECK were lower in tumor tissue specimens than in adjacent normal breast tissue specimens from 10 patients (P = 0.028). No relevant associations of RECK with established clinicopathologic factors or treatment regimens were found. RECK expression predicted a longer recurrence-free survival time (RFS; P = 0.037) at the optimal cutoff value (hazard ratio, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.44-0.98). The 100 patients whose tumors exhibited low levels of RECK had a mean RFS time of 80.4 months and a 61.8% 5-year RFS rate, whereas the 178 patients with tumors with high RECK expression had a mean RFS time of 91.2 months and a 73.0% 5-year RFS rate. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that RECK expression maintained a significant independent prognostic value for RFS time (P = 0.047).", 
    "543": "These results are in agreement with the notion of RECK being an important tumor-suppressor gene. Therefore, the possibility of applying RECK, a pharmaceutical mimetic, or drugs activating endogenous RECK expression, as possible therapeutic or preventive agents for breast carcinoma should be explored.", 
    "544": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are a widely used intervention for blood pressure control, and are particularly beneficial in hypertensive type 2 diabetic subjects with insulin resistance. The hemodynamic effects of ACE inhibitors are associated with enhanced levels of the vasodilator bradykinin and decreased production of the vasoconstrictor and growth factor angiotensin II (ATII). In insulin-resistant conditions, ACE inhibitors can also enhance whole-body glucose disposal and glucose transport activity in skeletal muscle. This review will focus on the metabolic consequences of ACE inhibition in insulin resistance. At the cellular level, ACE inhibitors acutely enhance glucose uptake in insulin-resistant skeletal muscle via two mechanisms. One mechanism involves the action of bradykinin, acting through bradykinin B(2) receptors, to increase nitric oxide (NO) production and ultimately enhance glucose transport. A second mechanism involves diminution of the inhibitory effects of ATII, acting through AT(1) receptors, on the skeletal muscle glucose transport system. The acute actions of ACE inhibitors on skeletal muscle glucose transport are associated with upregulation of insulin signaling, including enhanced IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase activity, and ultimately with increased cell-surface GLUT-4 glucose transporter protein. Chronic administration of ACE inhibitors or AT(1) antagonists to insulin-resistant rodents can increase protein expression of GLUT-4 in skeletal muscle and myocardium. These data support the concept that ACE inhibitors can beneficially modulate glucose control in insulin-resistant states, possibly through a NO-dependent effect of bradykinin and/or antagonism of ATII action on skeletal muscle.", 
    "545": "We studied time trends in long-term survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) for patient characteristics and described predictors for death after discharge. Because long-term prognosis among patients with coronary heart disease has improved in the last decades, we hypothesized that the prognosis after OHCA would improve with time.", 
    "546": "We analyzed data that were prospectively collected from all patients discharged from the hospital after OHCA in the community of G\u00f6teborg, Sweden, from 1980 to 1998 and divided the data into 2 time periods, 1980 to 1991 and 1991 to1998, with an equal number of patients.", 
    "547": "A total of 430 patients were included in the survey. Age, sex proportions, cardiovascular comorbidity, resuscitation factors, and inhospital complications did not change with time. A diagnosis of a precipitating myocardial infarction was more common during period 1 (66% vs 54%). The prescription of aspirin (22% vs 52%), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (7% vs 29%), anticoagulants (13% vs 27%), and lipid-lowering agents (0% vs 6%) at discharge increased during period 2. Long-term survival did not improve with time; the 5-year mortality rates were 53% in period 1 and 52% in period 2. Independent predictors of an increased risk of death included age (risk ratio [RR] 1.06, 95% CI 1.05-1.08), history of myocardial infarction (RR 2.02, 95% CI 1.51-2.72), history of smoking (RR 1.77, 95% CI 1.29-2.44), and worse cerebral performance at discharge (RR 1.71, 95% CI 1.44-2.02). The prescription of beta-blockers at discharge was independently predictive of decreased risk of death (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.46-0.85).", 
    "548": "The long-term survival rate after OHCA did not change. Baseline characteristics remained generally unchanged, but the drugs prescribed at discharge changed in several aspects. Age, a history of myocardial infarction, a history of smoking, cerebral performance category at discharge, and the prescription of beta-blockers were independent predictors of outcome.", 
    "549": "Terlipressin, a precursor that is metabolized to lysine-vasopressin, has been proposed as a drug for treatment of intraoperative arterial hypotension refractory to ephedrine in patients who have received long-term treatment with renin-angiotensin system inhibitors. The authors compared the effectiveness of terlipressin and norepinephrine to correct hypotension in these patients.", 
    "550": "Among 42 patients scheduled for elective carotid endarterectomy, 20 had arterial hypotension following general anesthesia that was refractory to ephedrine. These patients were the basis of the study. After randomization, they received either 1 mg intravenous terlipressin (n = 10) or norepinephrine infusion (n = 10). Beat-by-beat recordings of systolic arterial blood pressure and heart rate were stored on a computer. The intraoperative maximum and minimum values of blood pressure and heart rate, and the time spent with systolic arterial blood pressure below 90 mmHg and above 160 mmHg, were used as indices of hemodynamic stability. Data are expressed as median (95% confidence interval).", 
    "551": "Terlipressin and norepinephrine corrected arterial hypotension in all cases. However, time spent with systolic arterial blood pressure below 90 mmHg was less in the terlipressin group (0 s [0-120 s] vs. 510 s [120-1011 s]; P < 0.001). Nonresponse to treatment (defined as three boluses of terlipressin or three changes in norepinephrine infusion) occurred in zero and eight cases (P < 0.05), respectively.", 
    "552": "In patients who received long-term treatment with renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, intraoperative refractory arterial hypotension was corrected with both terlipressin and norepinephrine. However, terlipressin was more rapidly effective for maintaining normal systolic arterial blood pressure during general anesthesia.", 
    "553": "The most common cause of heart failure is coronary artery disease, and whilst intensive treatment of acute coronary syndromes and myocardial infarction continue to reduce the mortality associated with these conditions, many survivors develop heart failure. In general, heart failure secondary to ischaemic heart disease results from: (i) irreversible myocyte loss due to infarction with scar formation; (ii) chronic left ventricular dysfunction which may recover after revascularisation (hibernating myocardium); (iii) changes in remote myocardium (adverse remodelling). A number of studies suggest that patients with post-ischaemic heart failure may derive symptomatic and prognostic benefit from coronary revascularisation and most of this benefit is thought to derive from functional improvement of hibernating myocardium. Although the mechanisms of hibernation remain poorly understood, studies with positron emission tomography have shown that blood flow to hibernating myocardium is usually within or only slightly below the normal range whilst the coronary vasodilator reserve is always severely reduced and the concept that stunning and hibernation may be causally related has gained support in recent years. There is increasing consensus amongst clinicians regarding the importance of identifying and treating hibernating myocardium in patients with coronary artery disease and heart failure, and a randomised study comparing optimum medical treatment to optimum medical treatment with complete revascularisation has just commenced in the United Kingdom (HEART-UK) and will provide guidance regarding diagnosis and treatment of these patients.", 
    "554": "Angiotensin II (AII) receptor blockers offer an alternative means of blocking the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Being highly selective for the AII receptor subtype AT(1), AII receptor blockers may avoid side-effects associated with ACE inhibitor treatment, such as cough. Eprosartan is a non-biphenyl, non-tetrazole competitive blocker that is chemically distinct from other AII receptor blockers, which may account for differences in its pharmacological properties. It induces dual blockade of AT(1) receptors both presynaptically and postsynaptically, reducing sympathetic nerve activity to a significantly greater degree than other AT(1) receptor blockers. At the recommended dose of 600 mg once daily, eprosartan effectively lowers blood pressure (BP) in hypertensive patients to a similar degree as seen with other AII receptor blockers and ACE inhibitors. However, a greater proportion of patients achieved adequate BP control compared with enalapril. When eprosartan is given in combination with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), it provides a significantly greater BP reduction compared with eprosartan alone. Eprosartan has a side-effect profile that is similar to placebo and to other AII receptor blockers, but is better than that of enalapril because it lacks the propensity to cause dry cough. Eprosartan is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system, and so has no interaction with drugs that affect this system. Eprosartan completely reverses renal vasoconstriction induced by AII and may, therefore, have further applications in situations where stimulation of the RAAS is a problem. In summary, eprosartan, alone or in combination with HCTZ, provides an effective and well-tolerated approach to lowering BP in patients with all grades of hypertension. Further development of eprosartan may offer therapeutic opportunities that go far beyond the current recommendations.", 
    "555": "Management of hypertension in people with kidney disease is challenging and generally requires at least three different and complementary acting antihypertensive agents to achieve the recommended blood pressure goal by the JNC VI and WHO guidelines of <130/85 mmHg. This is also true for the recent blood pressure goal for diabetes of <130/80 mmHg recommended by both the National Kidney Foundation and American Diabetes Association for reduction of cardiovascular risk and preservation of kidney function. Commonly used combinations include an ACE inhibitor, which has compelling indications for use in people with kidney disease with a diuretic, generally a thiazide type agent. Angiotensin receptor blockers have clearly shown effectiveness for slowing nephropathy progression in Type 2 diabetes and clearly have a role as first-line agents in that disease. If additional therapy is required, either a beta blocker or calcium antagonist may be added to this antihypertensive 'cocktail'. Beta blockers are particularly effective in people with a high sympathetic drive, i.e. high pulse rates, to lower pressure and reduce cardiovascular risk. Moreover, in recent studies their benefits on kidney function both by reducing proteinuria and slowing decline of kidney function make them good agents to add in the appropriate clinical setting. Given recent data from an analysis of the NHANES III database showing only 11% of people being treated for hypertension with diabetic kidney disease have achieved the blood pressure goal of <130/85 mmHg, it's no wonder the incidence of people starting dialysis continues to climb. Physicians need to work harder and educate patients on the importance of achieving these lower blood pressure guidelines.", 
    "556": "Chronic renal failure and arterial hypertension run in parallel. New goal blood pressure levels have been established in 130/85 mmHg and 125/75 mmHg depending on the level of proteinuria being below or above 1 g/day. New and lower threshold BP (>130/85 mmHg) to initiate pharmacologic therapy are required in the presence of renal failure in order to facilitate the strict BP control that is required. Renal insufficiency is accompanied since its initial stages by a marked increase in cardiovascular risk and serum creatinine, its estimated clearance and the presence of proteinuria are very powerful predictors of a bad cardiovascular outcome. Hence, the need to consider that both renal and cardiovascular protection are obtained with such a strict BP control which, otherwise seems to require blockade of angiotensin II effects when proteinuria above 1g/day is present. Prevention of renal failure related to elevated blood pressure requires of strict blood pressure control, usually obtained with combination of two or more antihypertensive agents, one of them capable of blocking angiotensin II. Besides this, strict control of associated cardiovascular risk factors is also required.", 
    "557": "The aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy of the ACE inhibitor zofenopril in a cohort of diabetic patients with nonthrombolyzed anterior acute myocardial infarction who were enrolled in the Survival of Myocardial Infarction Long-Term Evaluation (SMILE) trial.", 
    "558": "Among the overall population of 1,512 patients, 303 (20.0%) had diabetes. The primary end point of this study was the effect of treatment on the 6-week combined occurrence of death and severe congestive heart failure (CHF). Secondary end points included the evaluation of the 6-week rate of major cardiovascular events as well as the 1-year survival rate.", 
    "559": "After 6 weeks of double-blind treatment, zofenopril significantly reduced both the incidence of the primary end point (8.6 vs. 18.3%; P = 0.019) and the 6-week incidence of severe CHF (0 vs. 7.3%; P = 0.001) in diabetic patients, and the effect was greater than that observed in nondiabetic patients. Conversely, 1-year mortality was significantly reduced among nondiabetic patients (9.1 vs. 13.8%; P = 0.010), whereas in the diabetic population, the decrease did not reach statistical significance (13.7 vs. 16.5%; P = 0.52).", 
    "560": "The present data suggest that the clinical outcome of patients with diabetes and myocardial infarction can be significantly improved by early treatment with zofenopril. The lesser effect on 1-year mortality seems to suggest that long-term treatment is probably needed to maintain the benefits of the early ACE inhibition in patients with diabetes.",

    "563": "In phase I, 644 patients attended a diabetes clinic over a 6-month period. Microalbuminuria results were available for 485 patients (75%). A total of 115 patients were identified as nephropaths (prevalence 17.8%). Of these patients, 91% had type 2 diabetes. During phase II, prospective analysis of urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio was carried out in 880 patients over 8 months. A total of 174 patients were identified as nephropaths (prevalence 20%). Of these, 134 patients had been identified by existing screening protocols. Forty had no previous record of microalbuminuria and were therefore newly identified by prospective screening. Systolic blood pressure guidelines were met in only 31% of all known nephropaths and 26.5% of newly diagnosed nephropaths. Diastolic blood pressure guidelines were met in 36% of all known and 38% of newly diagnosed nephropaths. In the patient group of known nephropaths from phases I and II, 62% were prescribed ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor (AIIR) antagonists. In the newly identified nephropathy patient cohort from phase II, 48% used ACEIs or AIIR antagonists.",

    "565": "Control of hypertension in patients with diabetic nephropathy improves mortality and slows progression to end-stage renal disease. However, blood pressure is difficult to treat; multiple drug combination therapy is required and treatment algorithms to establish this are lacking. We used a stepped-care algorithm, centered on maximum doses of an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker, to treat hypertension according to American Diabetes Association recommended blood pressure target goals (<130/80 mmHg) in patients with diabetic nephropathy.",

Mean blood pressure achieved was 140/75 +/- 23/14 mmHg in patients with type 1 diabetes and 146/76 +/- 22/14 mmHg in patients with type 2 diabetes. Target blood pressure was reached in 16 (33%) patients, 6 of 13 patients with type 1 diabetes and 10 of 36 patients with type 2 diabetes, whereas systolic blood pressure remained above the target level in the remaining patients. There was no difference in baseline blood pressure, proteinuria, or serum creatinine level between patients who were treated to target and those who were not.", 
    "568": "Levels of blood pressure control similar to those achieved in clinical trials in diabetic nephropathy were obtained with a stepped-care algorithm. However, in most patients, systolic blood pressure was difficult to control to target despite the use of multiple drug combination therapy.", 
    "569": "In recent years, new drug development and late-breaking research data have put treatment guidelines for diabetic nephropathy in a state of flux. In particular, trials of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), coupled with enhanced understanding of the renin-angiotensin pathway, have influenced recommendations for patient care. Here, Dr Bakris highlights both the steadfast features and the recent refinements of treatment guidelines for diabetic nephropathy. He describes their backing in research findings and outlines practical antihypertensive and renoprotective therapies to curtail risks of nephropathy and cardiovascular disease in patients with diabetes.", 
    "570": "The occurrence of severe acute renal failure in 3 patients who developed diarrhoea while taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors led us to undertake a retrospective cohort survey to determine the frequency with which diarrhoea and vomiting are associated with acute renal failure in patients taking this class of drug. Serum creatinine was measured as part of the diagnostic workup of 2398 consecutive admissions to an acute medical receiving unit in a district general hospital. Outcome measures were the presence of diarrhoea and/or vomiting, and whether taking an ACE inhibitor, NSAID or diuretic at the time of admission, also previous, initial and follow up serum creatinine concentrations. Peak serum creatinine in the 3 cases was 1159, 989 and 765 micromol/l. None of the 3 required dialysis and all recovered renal function completely after receiving large volumes of intravenous fluid. In the cohort study, 89 of 2398(3.7%) admissions had serum creatinine >/=200 micromol/l. Nine were regular dialysis patients. Of the remaining patients, 30 (37.5%) were taking an ACE inhibitor. Six of 30 (20%) gave a history of diarrhoea and/or vomiting. Median creatinine concentration in this group was 135 (range 111-209) micromol/l before admission, 292 (216-724) micromol/l when first seen in hospital, and 134 (94-219) micromol/l following the withdrawal of drug therapy and fluid replacement. In conclusion, volume depletion causing acute renal failure in patients taking ACE inhibitors is not uncommon. Such patients and their general practitioners should be aware that reversible renal impairment may occur during intercurrent illnesses, particularly if characterised by diarrhoea and/or vomiting.", 
    "571": "The purpose of this study was to assess the management of both hypertension and micro/macroalbuminuria in a cohort of type II diabetic patients. In the first 6 months of the year 2000, 5815 diabetic patients were identified through prescriptions for antidiabetic drugs in our sanitary district (191 568 inhabitants). In all, 65% (3810) of these type II diabetic patients were also given prescriptions for antihypertensive drugs. A total of 400 diabetic patients were randomly selected and 171 entered the study (gender: 94/77 M/F; age: 66.6+/-8 years; diabetes duration: 12+/-9 years): 100 patients (group DT) were treated with antihypertensive drugs and 71 (group DU) were untreated. Blood pressure, urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR), and glycated haemoglobin were measured in the two groups. A total of 80% (57/71) of DU patients were hypertensive (BP>/=130/85 mmHg). Specifically, 24.4% had diastolic hypertension (BP>/=85 mmHg) and 79% systolic hypertension (BP>/=130 mmHg). Only 63% (100/157) of the hypertensive patients were treated with antihypertensive drugs (two drugs/patient on average, range 1-5). In addition, only 13% of the DT patients were adequately controlled (BP<130/85 mmHg), while the others had above target blood pressure levels (14%: 130-139/85-89 mmHg; 40%: 140-159/90-95 mmHg, and 33%>/=160/95 mmHg). Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) were included in the antihypertensive medical regimen in 70% of the DT patients (ACE-I: 62%; ARB: 8%; diuretics: 39%; dihydropyridine calcium antagonists: 38%; alpha-blockers: 20%, beta-blockers: 17%; clonidin: 8%; nondihydropyridine calcium antagonists: 5%). Only 33% of type II diabetic patients underwent a screening for microalbuminuria as assessed on clinical records. The same percentage of micro- and macroalbuminuric patients (13.5%) was observed in the DT group, whereas 25% micro vs 3% macro were found in the DU group. In all, 73% of microalbuminuric patients were not on ACE-I/ARB. Hypertensive type II diabetic patients were often left untreated and only a minority of those treated were optimally controlled. The importance of an elevated systolic pressure is underestimated and the number of antihypertensive drugs prescribed insufficient. Screening and treatment of albuminuria are inadequate.", 
    "572": "Diabetes is a major public health problem that is approaching epidemic proportions in our society and worldwide. Cardiovascular disease is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in people with diabetes. Control of cardiovascular disease risk factors is achieved only in a minority of patients. Given the magnitude of the problem and the seriousness of diabetes complications, prevention appears to be a logical approach to curb the rising prevalence of the disease. Interventions such as lifestyle modifications and the use of metformin and acarbose have been shown in randomized prospective trials to prevent diabetes in high-risk patients. Other interventions are currently being examined in large prospective studies. It is likely that one or a combination of these approaches will make diabetes prevention a reality in the near future.", 
    "573": "Recent studies have shown that activity of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), a prothrombotic protein, may be increased in transplanted patients. The aim of the present investigation was to determine PAI-1 activity in pediatric recipients of renal transplants and to establish the relative contribution of both genetic and metabolic factors. In 29 children and adolescents with stable renal transplants, we related plasma PAI-1 activity to an indicator of inflammatory status [plasma concentration of C-reactive protein (CRP)] and to elements of the insulin resistance syndrome [body mass index (BMI), fasting insulinemia, HOMA index and plasma triglyceride, HDL-cholesterol, apolipoproteins A-1 and B concentrations]. Polymorphisms of PAI-1, apolipoprotein E (apoE) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) genes were also investigated. In all patients the study was repeated 1 year later. PAI-1 activity remained constantly elevated (23.4+/-22.8 and 18.6+/-7.8 U/ml in the first and second study, respectively, P=NS). Plasma PAI-1 activity correlated positively with CRP ( P=0.001), BMI z score ( P=0.02), fasting insulinemia ( P=0.009), and HOMA index ( P=0.006). No significant correlations were found in this population between plasma PAI-1 activity and age, gender, time elapsed after transplantation and plasma homocysteine, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, and apolipoprotein A-1. Plasma PAI-1 activity was not related to the cumulative dose of prednisone, cyclosporin A, or tacrolimus. Plasma PAI-1 activity was significantly higher in 5 children with apoE3/apoE4 genotype. No apparent influences of the PAI-1 4G/4G and ACE I/D genotypes were observed. In a multiple stepwise regression model, fasting insulinemia and apoE3/apoE4 genotype accounted for 45% of the observed plasma PAI-1 variability. We conclude that increased PAI-1 activity in children with stable renal transplants is determined both by genetic factors and by metabolic factors, the latter mainly linked to the insulin resistance syndrome.", 
    "574": "Some retrospective studies have suggested a beneficial influence of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on the progression of IgA nephropathy (IgAN), but prospective and controlled studies demonstrating this effect are lacking. Forty-four patients with biopsy-proven IgAN, proteinuria > or = 0.5 g/d, and serum creatinine (SCr) < or = 1.5 mg/dl were randomly assigned either to receive enalapril (n = 23) or to a control group (n = 21) in whom BP was controlled with antihypertensives other than ACE inhibitors. Primary outcome was renal survival estimated by a 50% increase in baseline SCr. Secondary outcomes were the presence of a SCr > 1.5 mg/dl at the last visit and the evolution of proteinuria. Baseline clinical findings were similar at baseline between enalapril-treated and control group, and there were no differences in BP control during follow-up. Mean follow-up was 78 +/- 37 mo in the enalapril group and 74 +/- 36 mo in the control group. Three patients (13%) in the enalapril group and 12 (57%) in the control group reached the primary end point (P < 0.05). Kaplan-Meier renal survival was significantly better in enalapril group than in control group: 100% versus 70% after 4 yr and 92% versus 55% after 7 yr (P < 0.05). Three patients in the enalapril group (13%) and 11 (52%) in the control group showed SCr > 1.5 mg/dl at the last visit (P < 0.05). Proteinuria significantly decreased in the enalapril group, whereas it tended to increase in the control group (P < 0.001 between groups). In conclusion, ACE inhibitors significantly improve renal survival in proteinuric IgAN with normal or moderately reduced renal function.", 
    "575": "The high prevalence of post-transplant glucose intolerance and insulin resistance (IR) is associated with older age, family history of diabetes, immunosuppressive drugs, and antihypertensive therapy. However, the potential determinants of post-transplant beta-cell dysfunction are largely unknown. The objective of the present study was to address this issue in detail. A total of 167 previously nondiabetic renal transplant recipients underwent a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)10 weeks after transplantation. Serum glucose and insulin were measured at 0, 1, and 2 hours. Three insulin release indices (Secr(AUC), Secr(1.phase), and Secr(2.phase)) were calculated to assess the insulin secretory response as the dependent variable. To account for variations in insulin sensitivity (IS), beta-cell function was also estimated as the disposition index (DI); the product of the IS index (ISI(TX)) and Secr(1.phase). Increasing age was strongly and independently associated with a blunted insulin secretory response even after adjustment for IS (P =.001). An 80-year-old recipient had an approximately 50% lower insulin release than a 20-year-old individual, based on the linear regression model. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease and treatment with furosemide were both independently associated with beta-cell dysfunction (DI; P <.001 and P =.008). Patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors had an enhanced absolute insulin release, but the DI was similar in both treated and untreated recipients. We conclude that older age is an important determinant of beta-cell dysfunction after renal transplantation. CMV disease and treatment with furosemide may also negatively influence pancreatic insulin release in renal transplant recipients.", 
    "576": "Hypertension and nephrotoxicity are frequent complications of cyclosporine-induced immunosuppression in renal transplant recipients. Long-term antihypertensive treatment is obligatory for hypertensive transplant patients, to protect allograft function. The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in the anti-hypertensive treatment of renal transplant recipients who receive immunosuppression with cyclosporine has long been discussed controversially. The aim of this prospective study, with a duration of 2 years and a follow-up of another 3 years, was to estimate the long-term antihypertensive potential of quinapril compared with that of the beta-blocker atenolol and to compare their effects on renal allograft function and proteinuria in 96 hypertensive renal transplant recipients who received cyclosporine A as immunosuppressive therapy. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either quinapril (group Q) or atenolol (group A) as anti-hypertensive treatment. Forty patients of each group completed the 5-year observation period according to protocol. Intention-to-treat and according-to-protocol analyses were performed. With the patients starting at similar baseline blood pressure values, both agents, atenolol and quinapril, decreased systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP) as well as middle arterial pressure (MAP) and pulse pressure (PP) to a similar extent (Delta SBP: group Q: -8+/-3 vs group A mmHg: -5+/-3; Delta DBP: -5+/-2 vs -4+/-2 mmHg; Delta MAP: -6+/-2 vs -5+/-2 mmHg; Delta PP: -2+/-2 vs -1+/-3 mmHg; mean +/- SEM). Neither serum creatinine levels nor Cockcroft-Gault clearance had changed significantly in either group after the 5-year period (Delta creatinine: 0.1+/-0.1 vs 0.2+/-0.2 mg/dl; Delta Cockcroft-Gault clearance: 3.9+/-4.6 vs 2.8+/-4.3 ml/min; mean +/- SEM). Urinary protein excretion remained stable among the quinapril-treated patients, whereas a significant increase was observed in the atenolol group during the 5-year study period (group Q: from 0.52+/-0.08 to 0.54+/-0.14 g/24 h; group A: from 0.34+/-0.03 to 0.72+/-0.13 g/24 h, P<0.02; mean +/- SEM). Albuminuria increased comparably in both groups, while the excretion of alpha-microglobuline increased slightly in the atenolol group, but decreased slightly in the quinapril group. The difference between the groups failed to be statistically significant (ANOVA, P<0.056). In conclusion, quinapril and atenolol may be considered suitable and safe substances in the long-term treatment of hypertensive renal transplant recipients, since both agents prove to be effective in anti-hypertensive treatment, and keep allograft function stable over a period of 5 years.", 
    "577": "For advanced progressive primary IgA nephropathy (IgAN) no established therapy exists. We conducted a prospective, uncontrolled trial to evaluate the effect of intravenous cyclophosphamide pulse (CyP) therapy on the course of advanced progressive IgAN. Twenty-one patients (mean age 52 +/- 10 years; male/female 20/1) with biopsy-proven IgAN without crescentic extracapillary proliferation and a serum creatinine of more than 2.0 mg/dl and/or an increase more than 25% in the previous 3 months were included. Patients were treated with CyP (750 mg/m(2 )body surface area) every 4 weeks for 6 months and low dose oral prednisolone. The loss of renal function per year was significantly reduced from 16% before therapy to 4% after therapy (p < 0.001). A further increase >25% of serum creatinine after therapy was observed in 8 patients after 0.7 years (range 0.3-3.0 years), and 3 of these patients developed end-stage renal disease. Proteinuria decreased significantly during CyP therapy. A low nadir of white blood cell and platelet count was associated with a better renal outcome (p = 0.025). In conclusion, CyP therapy and low dose oral prednisolone is effective in preserving renal function in a subgroup of patients with advanced progressive IgAN.",

We describe our experience combining individual patient data from 1946 subjects in 11 randomized controlled trials evaluating the effect of angiotensin-enzyme converting (ACE) inhibitors for treating nondiabetic renal disease. We sought to confirm the results of our meta-analysis of group data on the efficacy of ACE inhibitors in slowing the progression of renal disease, as well as to determine whether any study or patient characteristics modified the beneficial effects of treatment. In particular, we wanted to find out if the mechanism of action of ACE inhibitors could be explained by adjusting for follow-up blood pressure and urine protein. Each trial site sent a database of multiple files and multiple records per patient containing longitudinal data of demographic, clinical, and medication variables to the data coordinating center. The databases were constructed in several different languages using different software packages with unique file formats and variable names. Over 4 years, we converted the data into a standardized database of more than 60,000 records. We overcame a variety of problems including inconsistent protocols for measurement of key variables; varying definitions of the baseline time; varying follow-up times and intervals; differing medication-reporting protocols; missing variables; incomplete, missing, and implausible data values; and concealment of key data in text fields. We discovered that it was easier and more informative to request computerized data files and merge them ourselves than to ask the investigators to abstract partial data from their files. Although combining longitudinal data from different trials based on different protocols in different languages is complex, costly, and time-intensive, analyses based on individual patient data are extremely informative.

We investigated whether high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) (hs-CRP) is a predictor for LV remodeling in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with successful reperfusion, and also whether such a situation can be avoided by the administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB). The subjects were 139 patients with an initial attack of anterior myocardial infarction successfully treated by reperfusion therapy. They were randomly divided into the following two groups: an angiotensin (AG) group (91 patients treated with ACEI/ARB) and a NON-AG group (48 patients not treated with ACEI/ARB). Levels of hs-CRP, creatine kinase, human atrial natriuretic polypeptide, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), fasting blood glucose, serum lipids, fibrinogen, fibrin degradation product, prothromloin time, and activated partial thromboplastin time were measured immediately after 1, 2, 3, and 7 days, and 1 months after the onset of AMI. ACEI or ARB administration lowered hs-CRP levels and prevented the development of LV remodeling. Peak CRP levels significantly correlated with BNP levels during the acute stage (r = +0.54, P < 0.0001), end-diastolic volume index (r = +0.78, P < 0.0001), end-systolic volume index (r = +0.36, P = 0.0405), ejection fraction (r = -0.45, P = 0.0052), left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (r = +0.61, P < 0.0001), cardiac output (r = -0.52, P = 0.0005), cardiac index (r = -0.41, P = 0.0099), and systolic pulmonary arterial pressure (r = +0.48, P = 0.0017) 1 month after the onset of AMI in the NON-AG group but not in the AG group. Logistic multivariate analysis revealed that peak CRP alone was an independent risk factor for the development of LV remodeling in the NON-AG group (odds ratio = 1.79, P = 0.002). These results suggest that hs-CRP is a useful factor for predicting LV remodeling. Furthermore, ACEI or ARB administration to AMI patients showing increased hs-CRP levels during the early stage of the disease could prevent LV remodeling.", 
    "600": "The disposition and effect of benazepril and its active metabolite, benazeprilat, were evaluated in cats using a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model. Cats received single 1 mg/kg doses of intravenous 14C-benazeprilat and oral 14C-benazepril.HCl, and single and repeat (eight daily) oral administrations of 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg nonlabelled benazepril.HCl. The pharmacokinetic endpoints were plasma concentrations of benazepril and benazeprilat, and recovery of radioactivity in faeces and urine. The pharmacodynamic endpoint was plasma angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity. Benazeprilat data were fitted to an equation corresponding to a single-compartment model with a volume equal to the blood space (Vc = 0.093 L/kg). Within this space, benazeprilat was bound nonlinearly to ACE, which was mainly tissular (89.4%) rather than circulating (10.6%). Free benazeprilat was eliminated quickly from the central compartment (t1/2 approximately 1.0 h; Cl approximately 0.125 L/kg/h), elimination being principally biliary ( approximately 85%) rather than urinary ( approximately 15%). Nevertheless, inhibition of ACE was long-lasting (t1/2 16-23 h) due to high affinity binding of benazeprilat to ACE (Kd approximately 3.5 mmol/L, IC50 approximately 4.3 mmol/L). Simulations using the model predict a lack of proportionality between dose of benazepril, plasma benazeprilat concentrations and effect due to the nonlinear binding of benazeprilat to ACE. For example, increasing the dose of benazepril (e.g. above 0.125 mg/kg q24 h) produced only small incremental inhibition of ACE (either peak effect or duration of action).",

It was clear that the test strains in this study, in general, produce inhibitory substances in varying amounts. Using a spectrophotometric assay based on amino group derivatization with ortho-phthaldialdehyde as a measure of relative peptide content, it was shown that there is a significant correlation between peptide formation and ACE inhibition, indicating that peptide measurement constitutes a convenient selection method. The effect of active fermentates on in vivo ACE activity was demonstrated in normotensive rats. The pressor effect of angiotensin I (0.3 microg/kg) upon intravenous injection was significantly lower when rats were pre-fed with milks fermented using two strains of Lactobacillus helveticus. An increased response to bradykinin (10 microg/kg, intravenously injected) was observed using one of these fermented milks. It is concluded that Lactobacillus helveticus produces substances which in vivo can give rise to an inhibition of ACE. The inhibition in vivo was low compared to what can be achieved with classical ACE inhibitors. The clinical relevance of this finding is discussed. This work is the first in which an effect of fermented milk on ACE in vivo has been demonstrated, measured as decreased ability to convert angiotensin I to angiotensin II.",

Theoretically, there are two main strategies to treat the patients with ischemic heart failure; to retard progression of the dysfunction, and to relief and prevent myocardial ischemia. The management with angiotensin converting enzyme(ACE) inhibitor and beta-blocker improve the prognosis of ischemic heart failure by enhancing the left ventricular function and preventing coronary event. Spironolactone also seems to improve their prognosis. In contrast, treatments directed specifically at coronary arteries, such as antithrombotic agents and revascularization, have not been proven to be effective and safe to these patients yet.

Secondly, in light of the results of the RENAAL and IDNT studies, we consider ARBs as the drug of choice in diabetic subjects with hypertension and proteinuria (> 300 mg/L). Thirdly, we view ACE inhibitors and ARBs as equally adequate for the treatment of diabetic patients with hypertension and microalbuminuria and recommend the use of the maximal allowable doses of these drugs in such patients. Finally, older hypertensive individuals with left ventricular hypertrophy should receive either ACE inhibitors or ARBs, as these drug classes presently appear to provide better overall protection than beta blockers or calcium channel blockers in this particular subgroup of patients.",

After ligation of the coronary artery, rats were randomized to vehicle or ACE inhibitor (Captopril, 50 mg/kg/day) for 4 weeks. Blood pressure, cardiac remodeling, and components of the IGF system were localized in the heart using in situ hybridization (ISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). The average infarct size was 42%. There were regional differences in the expression of the IGF system after MI, with increased IGF-I mRNA abundance in the border (24-fold) and infarct (12-fold) and increased IGF-binding protein (IGFBP)-3 mRNA in all areas of the failing left ventricle (threefold). Captopril reduced blood pressure, attenuated cardiac remodeling, and caused a threefold increase in IGF-I receptor mRNA and protein in infarct, border zone, and viable myocardium (p<0.01). Captopril had no effect on IGF-I mRNA but further increased IGFBP-3 mRNA and protein in the border zone, (p<0.05). The changes in the cardiac IGF system following MI are highly localized, persist for at least 4 weeks, and can be modulated by ACE inhibition. These data suggest that the benefits of ACE inhibitors in attenuation of cardiac remodeling may be mediated in part through increased expression of the IGF-I receptor sensitizing the myocardium to the positive effects of endogenous IGF-I.", 
    "614": "Angiotensin II (ANG II), generated by activation of local renin-angiotensin systems, is believed to play an important role in tissue repair and remodeling, in part via transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to abrogate experimental lung injury via a number of potential mechanisms; however, the potentially fibroproliferative role for ANG II in the lung has not been characterized. We hypothesized that, after lung injury, ANG II would stimulate fibroblast procollagen synthesis and promote lung collagen deposition in rats. In vitro, ANG II was a potent inducer of procollagen production in human lung fibroblasts via activation of the type 1 receptor and, at least in part, via the autocrine action of TGF-beta. After bleomycin-induced lung injury, an increase in lung ANG II concentration was observed by day 3 that preceded increases in lung collagen and was maintained until death at day 21. Administration of an ACE inhibitor (ramipril) reduced ACE activity, ANG II concentration, TGF-beta expression, and collagen deposition. Losartan (an ANG II type 1 receptor antagonist) also attenuated the increase in TGF-beta expression and lung collagen deposition. These observations suggest that ANG II, possibly generated locally within the lung, may play an important role in the fibrotic response to acute lung injury, at least in part via the action of TGF-beta. ACE inhibitors and receptor antagonists, already widely used clinically, should be assessed as potential new therapies for fibrotic lung disease.", 
    "615": "Many clinicians are uncomfortable about using angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (AT(1)-blockers) to treat patients with renal disease because of concerns about increasing serum creatinine levels. However, the benefits of these medications, particularly their efficacy in slowing the progression of renal disease, outweigh such concerns. ACE inhibitors are effective in patients with type 1 diabetes and renal disease, as well as in those with nondiabetic renal disease and proteinuria >0.5 g/d. AT(1)-blockers slow the progression of diabetic nephropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes. Although these classes of medications should not be used in patients with severe renal insufficiency (e.g., glomerular filtration rate <20 mL/min), they may be beneficial in patients with mild-to-moderate renal insufficiency. Nonetheless, caution should be exercised in those with a glomerular filtration rate <30 mL/min, and serum creatinine and potassium levels should be checked approximately 1 week after starting treatment. There is also evidence suggesting that these medications lead to greater reductions in blood pressure and proteinuria when used in combination than when alone. The purpose of this paper is to review the mechanisms of action of these two classes of medication, as well as the experimental and clinical evidence that they slow the progression of renal disease.", 
    "616": "Systolic hypertension with or without diastolic hypertension is a major problem in hemodialysis (HD) patients; isolated diastolic hypertension is uncommon. Accelerated age-related changes in vascular stiffness, together with factors peculiar to uremia, lead to loss of large and small vessel distensibility and profound changes in circulatory function that includes an increase in systolic pressure and widening of the pulse pressure. Epidemiologic studies show a direct relationship of mortality with systolic blood pressure (BP) and an inverse relationship with diastolic BP. Thus systolic BP should be the focus of treatment. In HD patients with systolic hypertension, diastolic BP is inversely related to cardiovascular risk. An accurate diagnosis of hypertension followed by nonpharmacologic measures (sodium restriction, exercise, dry weight) should be the initial steps in BP reduction. The second step should be the use of antihypertensive agents, particularly the use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and/or beta-blockers. The use of these agents has been associated with better outcomes in observational studies in HD patients. Furthermore, the administration of atenolol and lisinopril can be supervised three times a week to achieve improved BP control. Daily dialysis may improve BP and cardiovascular risk factors. Although more difficult to implement, it may emerge as a feasible alternative to conventional dialysis. Adequate systolic BP control with these available and emerging techniques should help stem the tide of cardiovascular mortality and mortality in HD patients.",

While the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril and the antagonist of angiotensin II AT 1 receptors losartan prevent the development of both hypertension and morphological changes, the selective beta1-adrenoceptor antagonist atenolol could prevent only the increase in blood pressure. It is concluded that at least two factors are involved in the development of the hypertensive state.",

By in situ hybridization, HIV-1 genes were detected in glomerular and tubular epithelial cells and infiltrating mononuclear cells, which also expressed the HIV-1 envelop protein gp120. The development of HIVAN was associated with the accumulation of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in the kidney.",

The antiproteinuric effect was not improved either by the higher ramipril doses (-30% after the 20 mg dose) or after combined treatment (-33%). The reduction of proteinuria led to amelioration of the markers of tubular damage, as testified by the significant decrement of alpha 1 microglobulin (alpha 1m) excretion and of the tubular component of proteinuria at sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).",

These effects were prevented by ramipril, associated with the prevention of albuminuria and tubular injury as demonstrated by the expression of osteopontin and glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPX-3). An infusion of Ang II also reduced NMN clearance but without altering the renal expression of OCTs.", 
    "633": "We hypothesize that reduced expression of OCTs in diabetes may be a marker of tubular injury. However, Ang II may also directly augment renal cation clearance independent of changes in transporter expression.

In addition, the absolute bioavailability of an immediate-release formulation of M100240 was assessed. Pharmacokinetic data were obtained from 13 healthy subjects in an open-label, single-dose, randomized, five-period crossover study. Treatments included 25 mg M100240 administered via short intravenous infusion, oral immediate-release tablet administration, and oral Enterion capsule delivery of drug substance to the proximal small bowel, distal small bowel, and ascending colon. Each treatment was separated by a 14-day drug-free washout period. The localization of the Enterion capsule in the gastrointestinal tract was monitored using scintigraphic imaging. M100240 and MDL 100,173 plasma concentrations were quantified using a validated LC/MS/MS method, and pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using noncompartmental methods. The estimates of relative bioavailability in the proximal small bowel, distal small bowel, and ascending colon relative to the oral immediate-release tablet are approximately 94%, 97%, and 41%, respectively. M100240 is primarily absorbed throughout the proximal and distal small bowel with modest absorption in the ascending colon.

CBF was measured repetitively with the intracarotid 133Xe injection method, whereas blood pressure was lowered to determine the lower limit of autoregulation. To remove renin from the blood, rats were bilaterally nephrectomized and kept alive with peritoneal dialysis for 48 h. Five groups of animals were studied: 1) nephrectomized dialyzed rats, 2) nephrectomized dialyzed rats given a single intravenous dose of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (10 mg/kg), 3) sham nephrectomized and dialyzed rats, 4) rats receiving drugs as dialyzed rats but no surgery, and 5) rats given the same diet as the other groups but no drugs and no surgery. Baseline blood pressure was significantly lower in nephrectomized rats compared with controls. Nephrectomy, captopril, sham operation, or dialysis did not influence baseline CBF. The lower limit of CBF autoregulation was significantly lower in nephrectomized (53 +/- 4 mmHg) and sham-operated (58 +/- 4 mmHg) rats compared with diet control rats (78 +/- 3 mmHg). Captopril significantly decreased the lower limit in nephrectomized rats (35 +/- 2 mmHg). Thus removal of circulating renin caused no change in the lower limit of autoregulation. By contrast, captopril lowered the lower limit even in the absence of circulating renin and hence appeared to exert its effect on components of the renin-angiotensin system in the cerebral resistance vessel walls.",

Certain high-risk conditions are compelling indications for the initial use of other antihypertensive drug classes (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers); (5) Most patients with hypertension will require 2 or more antihypertensive medications to achieve goal BP (<140/90 mm Hg, or <130/80 mm Hg for patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease); (6) If BP is more than 20/10 mm Hg above goal BP, consideration should be given to initiating therapy with 2 agents, 1 of which usually should be a thiazide-type diuretic; and (7) The most effective therapy prescribed by the most careful clinician will control hypertension only if patients are motivated.

    "673": "Earlier work in this laboratory showed that amiodarone induces apoptosis in alveolar epithelial cells by a mechanism inhibitable by angiotensin system antagonists. A variety of recent studies suggests a critical role for alveolar epithelial cell apoptosis in the pathogenesis of lung fibrosis. On this basis we hypothesized that amiodarone-induced alveolar epithelial cell apoptosis and lung fibrosis in vivo might be inhibitable by the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril or the angiotensin receptor antagonist losartan. Amiodarone-induced lung fibrosis was induced in male Wistar rats by oral administration over six months. Replicate groups of rats received captopril or losartan in addition to amiodarone. Apoptosis was detected by increased total lung activity of caspase 3 and in situ end labeling (ISEL) of fragmented DNA. Collagen was localized and quantitated by the picrosirius red technique. Alveolar epithelial cell apoptosis was detected in amiodarone-treated animals as early as three weeks after the start of amiodarone administration; by six months exposure, the incidence of alveolar epithelial cell apoptosis was significantly reduced by coadministration of captopril or losartan. Alveolar wall collagen accumulation also was significantly attenuated by captopril (100%) or losartan (74%), but neither agent blunted the accumulation of alveolar macrophages evoked by amiodarone (5.3-fold at 6 months). Lung neutrophil content was unchanged by amiodarone treatment for three weeks or six months. These results indicate that amiodarone induces alveolar epithelial cell apoptosis in vivo that is inhibitable by angiotensin antagonists. They also support the hypothesis that blockade of angiotensin formation or function attenuates amiodarone-induced lung fibrosis irrespective of the severity of alveolitis.",

Surprisingly, these studies showed that blood pressure does not change with mild quantitative changes in the expression of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). Yet, ACE inhibitors are widely used for the treatment of hypertension. This apparent paradox motivated us to develop a simple computer simulation, which qualitatively reconciled the paradox. We have now improved the simulation by including blood pressure as an explicit variable and by adding the kallikrein-kinin system and feedback control of plasma renin via plasma angiotensin II levels. The new simulation now matches quantitative aspects of the experimental data and suggests that a decrease in bradykinin plays an important role in the increased risk of diabetic nephropathy associated with genetically determined higher levels of ACE activity. This emphasizes that the value of these types of simulation lies in the thoughts that they provoke rather than in their ability to replicate experimental data.", 
    "683": "PGE2, the major cyclooxygenase (COX) metabolite of arachidonic acid, is an important paracrine regulator of numerous tubular and vascular functions in the kidney. To date, COX activity has been considered the key step in prostaglandin synthesis and is well characterized. However, much less is known about the recently cloned microsomal PGE2 synthase (mPGES), the terminal enzyme of PGE2 synthesis, which converts COX-derived PGH2 to the biologically important PGE2. Present studies provide the detailed localization of mPGES protein in the rabbit kidney using immunohistochemistry. In the cortex, strong mPGES labeling was found in the macula densa (MD) and principal cells of the connecting segment and cortical collecting tubule but not in intercalated cells. The medulla was abundant in mPGES-positive structures, with heavy labeling in the collecting duct system. In descending thin limbs and renal medullary interstitial cells, mPGES expression was less intense, and it was below the limits of detection in the vasa recta. Expression of MD mPGES, similarly to COX-2, was greatly increased in response to low-salt diet and angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibition by captopril. These findings suggest autocrine regulation of renal salt and water transport by PGE2 in descending thin limb and collecting tubule and a paracrine effect of PGE2 on the glomerular and medullary vasculature. Similar to other organs, mPGES in the kidney is an inducible enzyme and may be similarly regulated and acts in concert with COX-2.",

The mean plaque area of omapatrilat-treated nondiabetic mice was 9357 +/- 7293 microm2, versus 71977 +/- 34610 microm2 in the nontreated mice (P = .002). In the diabetic animals, the plaque area was 8887 +/- 5386 microm2 and 23220 +/- 10400 microm2, respectively for treated and nontreated mice (P = .001). Plasma lipids were increased by omapatrilat: Mean plasma cholesterol in treated mice, diabetic and nondiabetic combined, was 39.31 +/- 6.00 mmol/L, versus 33.12 +/- 7.64 mmol/L in the nontreated animals (P = .008). The corresponding combined mean values of triglycerides were 4.83 +/- 1.93 versus 3.00 +/- 1.26 mmol/L (P = .02). Omapatrilat treatment did not affect weight or plasma glucose levels. Treatment with omapatrilat inhibits atherogenesis in diabetic as well as nondiabetic LDL receptor-deficient mice despite an increase in plasma lipids, suggesting a direct effect on the arterial wall.", 
    "685": "There is evidence that diuretics and beta blockers impair glucose tolerance, whereas calcium channel blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme blockers lack this metabolic effect.

    "686": "A total of 463 hypertensive outpatients with non-insulin treated type 2 diabetes on stable antidiabetic therapy for at least 3 months and with HbA(1c) between 6.5% and 10% were recruited. In a randomized, double blind trial patients were treated for 20 weeks with fixed combinations of verapamil sustained release (SR) plus trandolapril and of atenolol plus chlorthalidone following a 2-week placebo run-in period. The main outcome measures were HbA(1c), fasting plasma glucose, and fructosamine levels as well as systolic and diastolic blood pressure.", 
    "687": "HbA(1c) remained stable at 7.9% after administration of verapamil SR plus trandolapril and increased from 7.8% to 8.6% with atenolol plus chlorthalidone; the differences between treatment groups were significant at 4, 12, and 20 weeks of treatment and at last visit (P <.0001). Mean blood pressure fell from 169/96 to 150/85 and from 168/95 to 145/83 mm Hg after administration of verapamil SR plus trandolapril and atenolol plus chlorthalidone, respectively. Both combinations were well tolerated.",

    "689": "The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) enalapril has been shown to lower elevated levels of circulating adhesion molecules (cAM) in critically ill patients. To delineate the mechanisms of this possibly beneficial effect of enalapril, we studied the acute effects of enalapril in a well-defined model of endotoxin-triggered, cytokine-mediated cAM up-regulation. In a randomized, controlled trial, 30 healthy male volunteers received 2 ng/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS) after pretreatment with placebo or 20 mg/day enalapril for 5 days or with a single dose of 20 mg of enalapril 2 h before LPS infusion. LPS infusion increased TNF levels 300-fold above normal, circulating (c) E-selectin levels by 425% (CI, 359%-492%), and P-selectin, VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and von Willebrand factor levels by 47%-74%. LPS infusion also enhanced ICAM-1 and CD11b expression 2- to 3-fold on monocytes. However, no differences were seen between treatment groups (P > 0.05), despite 95% inhibition of ACE activity by enalapril. Inhibition of ACE activity by enalapril does not influence plasma indices of endothelial activation after endotoxin infusion in healthy individuals. Our results do not support the concept of a beneficial clinical effect of enalaprilat in septicemia.", 
    "690": "A simple in vitro protocol simulating gastrointestinal digestion of proteins and peptides to investigate the effect of digestive enzymes on the biological activity of peptides present in dairy products was developed. This protocol consisted in a 30 min incubation with pepsin followed by a 4 h incubation with trypsin or pancreatin. It was applied to an Emmental cheese water-soluble extract (WSE) and to a casein solution (as a control). Sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) allowed to monitor the digestion of proteins. Reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) allowed to monitor the conversion of proteins and peptides into peptides and amino acids: it is proposed to use the mean retention time corresponding to the overall retention time distribution of molecules to assess the effect of digestive enzymes. The biological activity focused in this study was the angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity. Digestion of Emmental WSE induced an increase of the ACE inhibition as compared to undigested WSE while a 10 kDa ultrafiltered WSE lost a part of its ACE inhibitory activity after digestion process. These results strongly suggest that digestive enzymes diminished the ACE inhibition by the peptides present in Emmental cheese WSE, while the digestion of peptides of high molecular weight would generate new ACE inhibitory peptides.",

Impaired vascular function contributes to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and acute coronary syndromes.

In this review, the role of oxidative stress in mechanisms of vascular dysfunction is discussed, and potential antioxidant strategies are reviewed.", 
    "692": "One hundred seventy-six consecutive patients treated with IV tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) for acute ischemic stroke were examined prospectively, and orolingual angioedema was found in nine (5.1%; 95% CI 2.3 to 9.5). The reaction was typically mild, transient, and contralateral to the ischemic hemisphere. Risk of angioedema was associated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (relative risk [RR] 13.6; 95% CI 3.0 to 62.7) and signs on initial CT of ischemia in the insular and frontal cortex (RR 9.1; 95% CI 1.4 to 30.0).", 
    "693": "To seek evidence that the nonhuman primate arterial wall, as it ages in the absence of atherosclerosis, exhibits alterations in pathways that are involved in the pathogenesis of experimental atherosclerosis, we assessed aortic matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and its regulators, ie, membrane type-1 of matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2), and the expression of angiotensin II (Ang II), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), and chymase in young (6.4+/-0.7 years) and old (20.0+/-1.9 years) male monkeys. With advancing age, (1) the intimal thickness increased 3-fold and contained numerous vascular smooth muscle cells and matrix, but no inflammatory cells; (2) the intimal MMP-2 antibody-staining fraction increased by 80% (P<0.01); (3) in situ zymography showed that MMP-2 activity, mainly confined to the intima, increased 3-fold (P<0.01); (4) the MT1-MMP antibody-staining fraction increased by 150% (P<0.001), but the TIMP-2 antibody-staining fraction did not significantly change; (5) steady levels of the mRNA-staining fraction (via in situ hybridization) for MMP-2 increased 7-fold, for MT1-MMP increased 9-fold, and for TIMP-2 increased 2-fold (all P<0.001); and (6) intimal Ang II and ACE immunofluorescence were increased 5-fold and 5.6-fold, respectively, and colocalized with MMP-2. Thus, age-associated arterial remodeling and the development and progression of experimental atherosclerosis in young animals share common mechanisms, ie, MMP-2 activation and increased Ang II signaling. This might explain, in part, the dramatically exaggerated prevalence and severity of vascular diseases with aging.", 
    "694": "Angiotensin (Ang) II, which plays a crucial role in the cardiac remodeling process, is generated via angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE); however, an alternative generation pathway, chymase, which is stored in the mast cells, also exists in the heart. Cardiac chymase is insensitive to ACE inhibitors (ACEIs), and heart chymase promotes interstitial fibrosis by affecting collagen metabolism via transforming growth factor-beta in vitro. Therefore, selective chymase blockade seems to be an important strategy in the prevention of cardiac remodeling", 
    "695": "We evaluated the effects of a specific chymase inhibitor, SUNC8257 (Chy I; 10 mg/kg twice a day; n=7), on changes in cardiac structures, Ang II levels, and gene expressions, which are characterized as molecular markers for fibrosis, in dogs with tachycardia induced heart failure (HF). In HF, the number of chymase enzyme-positive mast cells increased in the left ventricle (LV) compared with the normal group; however, Chy I significantly decreased the mast cell density and cardiac Ang II levels. Despite no significant differences in LV systolic function compared with the vehicle group, Chy I decreased LV end-diastolic pressure and shortened the prolongation of tau. Chy I suppressed collagen-type I and III and transforming growth factor-beta mRNA levels and decreased fibrosis in the LV compared with the vehicle.", 
    "696": "The chymase pathway may be critical for cardiac diastolic dysfunction accompanied with fibrosis. Chronic chymase inhibition may therefore become an important strategy in the prevention of cardiac remodeling in HF.", 
    "697": "The activities of cardiac protein kinase C (PKC) were examined in hemodynamically assessed rats subsequent to myocardial infarction (MI). Both Ca(2+)-dependent and Ca(2+)-independent PKC activities increased significantly in left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) homogenates at 1, 2, 4, and 8 wk after MI was induced. PKC activities were also increased in both LV and RV cytosolic and particulate fractions from 8-wk infarcted rats. The relative protein contents of PKC-alpha, -beta, -epsilon, and -zeta isozymes were significantly increased in LV homogenate, cytosolic (except PKC-alpha), and particulate fractions from the failing rats. On the other hand, the protein contents of PKC-alpha, -beta, and -epsilon isozymes, unlike the PKC-zeta isozyme, were increased in RV homogenate and cytosolic fractions, whereas the RV particulate fraction showed an increase in the PKC-alpha isozyme only. These changes in the LV and RV PKC activities and protein contents in the 8-wk infarcted animals were partially corrected by treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor imidapril. No changes in protein kinase A activity and its protein content were seen in the 8-wk infarcted hearts. The results suggest that the increased PKC activity in cardiac dysfunction due to MI may be associated with an increase in the expression of PKC-alpha, -beta, and -epsilon isozymes, and the improvement of heart function in the infarcted animals by imidapril may be due to partial prevention of changes in PKC activity and isozyme contents.",

Participants were assigned to either active treatment (perindopril for all participants and indapamide for those with neither an indication for nor a contraindication to a diuretic) or matching placebo(s). The primary outcomes for these analyses were dementia (using DSM-IV criteria) and cognitive decline (a decline of 3 or more points in the Mini-Mental State Examination score).",

Cognitive decline occurred in 9.1% of the actively treated group and 11.0% of the placebo group (risk reduction, 19% [95% confidence interval, 4% to 32%]; P =.01). The risks of the composite outcomes of dementia with recurrent stroke and of cognitive decline with recurrent stroke were reduced by 34% (95% confidence interval, 3% to 55%) (P =.03) and 45% (95% confidence interval, 21% to 61%) (P<.001), respectively, with no clear effect on either dementia or cognitive decline in the absence of recurrent stroke.",

    "702": "Aggressive therapy for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and renal disease is warranted given the natural history of this disease. Although antagonizing the renin-angiotensin system is clearly important, how this is accomplished is of considerable controversy. On the one hand, recent clinical trials of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with renal disease demonstrate unequivocally the renal protective effect of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). Although the results of the recently published LIFE trial are encouraging, inconsistencies have been observed with ARBs in reducing cardiovascular end points. On the other hand, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have a dramatic effect in reducing cardiovascular events but have not been shown convincingly to reduce progression of renal disease in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. These studies leave us in a quandary as to the optimal initial treatment regimen for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and renal disease despite the recent recommendations from the American Diabetes Association (Alexandria, Va). Given the fact that many of these individuals will require administration of multiple antihypertensive agents, perhaps the initial treatment with a combination of an ARB and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor affords optimal cardiovascular and renal protection for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and renal disease. Future clinical trials should be designed to address this issue.",

    "708": "Vasopeptidase inhibitors simultaneously inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and neutral endopeptidase (NEP). The present study characterized the tissue distributions of ACE and NEP, and assessed the effects of the vasopeptidase inhibitor omapatrilat on ACE and NEP in rat tissues. In vivo ACE and NEP inhibition was studied by in vitro autoradiography and using the ACE inhibitor radioligand (125)I-MK351A and the NEP inhibitor radioligand (125)I-RB104 in rats that received oral omapatrilat (40 mg x day(-1) x kg(-1)) for 3 days. In vitro autoradiography was used to examine the distribution of ACE and NEP in the kidney, aorta, heart, adrenal gland, lung, intestine, liver, spleen and brain, and to assess enzyme inhibition after oral omapatrilat. Omapatrilat inhibited plasma ACE and increased plasma renin activity (P <0.01). Tissue ACE was inhibited by 70-95% (P <0.01), except in the brain, where ACE was not inhibited. NEP was inhibited by 87% in the kidney and by 20-40% in atria, aorta, adrenal gland, lung, liver and intestine; it was not inhibited in the brain, the ventricle or the spleen. Omapatrilat is a potent vasopeptidase inhibitor that significantly inhibits tissue ACE and NEP, with the degree of inhibition varying according to the enzyme and the tissue under assessment. The degree and site of tissue enzyme inhibition by vasopeptidase inhibitors may be relevant to end-organ protection as well as to the side-effect profiles of these agents.", 
    "709": "The efficiency of the developed scheme for a drug prophylaxis of chronic cardiac insufficiency (CCI) in patients with diabetes mellitus I (DM I) of autoimmune genesis (subtype B) was evaluated; such scheme comprised the inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) of different chemical structures and a biological response modifier (BRM)--glutoxime, which were prescribed with regard for a changed biological rhythm of hemodynamic as well as of metabolic and immune profiles of patients. The following parameters were examined: cardiohaemodynamics, the content of cortisol, insulin, ACTH, TTH and thyroxin in blood, of transport proteins and of the concentration of IL-1 and TNF-alpha in blood. It was established that the use of ramipril and fosinopril combined with the glutoxime BRM within the scheme of drug prophylaxis of CCI concomitant with DM I was accompanied by an effective removal of desynchronosis of the immune-endocrine system in the discussed category of patients.", 
    "710": "Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability and dependency in western society. Despite the determined efforts of basic science and clinical investigators, neuroprotective therapies for acute stroke have yet to be realised. Stroke prevention, therefore, remains the key route for reducing morbidity and mortality. Hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia are the most important modifiable risk factors for stroke. Several recent landmark studies have shown that lipid lowering with statins can reduce the risk of ischaemic stroke, as well as coronary heart disease. In addition, clinical trials evaluating the effects of blood pressure lowering have shown that antihypertensive agents such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and angiotensin II receptor antagonists can reduce stroke risk. Accumulating evidence suggests certain antihypertensive agents such as CCBs might also prevent the formation and progression of carotid atheroma, independently of their blood-pressure-lowering effects. It follows that rigorous identification and targeting of high- risk or stroke-prone individuals for blood pressure and lipid-lowering interventions should be of practical importance to all physicians involved in the management of stroke.", 
    "711": "Since the pioneering publications of the Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program (HDFP) and the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT) in the late 1970s and early 1980s, it has become established that lowering blood pressure in high-risk patients is a highly effective form of primary prevention for stroke. Over the subsequent 25 years, over 30 large clinical trials have extended these initial observations to allow us to conclude that treatment of mild, moderate or severe hypertension, and isolated systolic hypertension in the elderly, all produce important absolute benefits. In addition, excellent specific evidence of benefit is now accumulating for certain groups of normotensive patients, including those with previous stroke, and those with established cardiovascular disease. Although the importance of vigorous antihypertensive therapy for the primary and secondary prevention of stroke is increasingly clear, a large number of unanswered questions remain. For example, while it is apparent that diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are all effective antihypertensive agents, the question remains as to which drug, or combination of drugs, is best for which patients. The results of several ongoing comparative trials of different drug regimens, including the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT), may elucidate this further.", 
    "712": "Atherosclerosis is a systemic disease that can ultimately lead to ischaemia and infarction in the heart, brain and peripheral vasculature. According to the \"response to injury\" hypothesis, endothelial dysfunction is the early event that allows penetration of lipids and inflammatory cells into the arterial wall, contributing to the development of the atherosclerotic lesion. Endothelial dysfunction is causally related to a variety of risk factors for atherosclerosis, including hyperlipidaemia and hypertension. Agents that restore endothelial function and NO bioavailability have beneficial anti-atherogenic activities and can improve cardiovascular outcomes; this has been observed with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, statins and certain dihydropyridine-type calcium channel blockers (CCBs). In the Prospective Randomised Evaluation of the Vascular Effects of Norvasc Trial (PREVENT), the CCB amlodipine provided significant clinical benefits compared with placebo, including a marked reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and a reduction in the progression of carotid atherosclerosis. As these beneficial effects of amlodipine have not been observed with other dihydropyridine-type CCBs, it has been proposed that this agent has distinct anti-atherosclerotic properties related to its strong lipophilicity and membrane location. Experimental support for this hypothesis has been obtained from various in vitro and in vivo models of atherosclerosis. These findings support a broader therapeutic role for third-generation dihydropyridine-type CCBs in the treatment of atherosclerosis.", 
    "713": "The ALLHAT (The Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering treatment to prevent Heart Attack Trial) trial enrolled hypertensive patients with at least one additional risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD) to a comparison of the diuretic chlorthalidone, the calcium channel blocker, amlodipine, and the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, lisinopril. Throughout the study, chlorthalidone decreased the systolic blood pressure to a slightly, but significantly greater extent (0.8-3.1 mmHg) than amlodipine or lisinopril. No significance differences were reported for amlodipine versus chlorthalidone or lisinopril versus chlorthalidone on the primary outcome of combined incidence of fatal CHD and nonfatal myocardial infarction. The findings of ALLHAT support the use of thiazide-type diuretics as first choice pharmacological therapy in at risk patients with hypertension. ANBP2 (The Second Australian National Blood Pressure Study) was also a comparison between diuretics (hydrochlorothiazide) and ACE inhibitors (enalapril) but was performed in older hypertensives that had few previous cardiovascular events. Diastolic blood pressure reduction was similar in both groups at all times. The risk of the primary outcome of all cardiovascular events or death from any cause was 11% lower in the ACE group than the diuretic group and the benefit was predominantly in men. Thus, ANBP2 suggests that in relatively healthy elderly hypertensive patients, ACE inhibitors should be preferred to diuretics.", 
    "714": "Congestive heart failure (CHF) due to progressive systolic dysfunction has become a modern-day epidemic. Despite the increased incidence and prevalence, significant progress has been made in the past 10 to 15 years in the treatment of CHF at all stages. The current outlook for patients with newly diagnosed, mild heart failure is encouraging. It should be noted, however, that most of the morbidity and health care expenditure is incurred by a minority of patients diagnosed with CHF who are in the advanced stages of their disease. The thrust of this article will be to provide practical advice beyond current guidelines on the management of advanced CHF.", 
    "715": "To examine the possible neuroprotective effect of temocapril, one kind of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, against glutamate-induced neurotoxicity, we analyzed the pharmacologic utility of temocapril in a post-natal organotypic culture model of motor neuron degeneration. Treatment with 10(-5) M of glutamate resulted in a motor neuron loss and decreased activity of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). Cotreatment of 10(-5) M of glutamate and temocapril revealed protective effect on motor neuron death and decreased activity of ChAT. Next we performed reverse transcription-PCR analysis for cyclooxygenase-II (COX-II). COD-II mRNA was upregulated in glutamate-treated culture. Cotreatment with temocapril and glutamate inhibited upregulation of COX-II. Taken together, temocapril may have therapeutic potential for diseases which associate with upregulation of COX-II, in addition to its role in glutamate excitotoxicity.", 
    "716": "We examined the effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors captopril, enalaprilat, quinapril, and trandolapril, and their active metabolites quinaprilat and trandolaprilat, on hemolysis induced by lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) in human erythrocytes. LPC induced hemolysis at the concentrations above the critical micelle concentration (4 microM). Propranolol, used as a reference drug, attenuated the 50% hemolysis induced by 6 microM LPC at concentrations ranging from 100 nM to 100 microM. Similarly, quinaprilat (10 microM) and trandolaprilat (10, 100 microM) significantly attenuated the LPC-induced hemolysis, but other ACE inhibitors did not. Since propranolol possesses a membrane stabilizing action correlated with high lipophilicity, it appears that the high lipophilicity of quinaprilat or trandolaprilat is responsible for the protection from the damage induced by LPC. However, quinapril and trandolapril were not effective, although both drugs have higher lipophilicity than quinaprilat and trandolaprilat. Hence, it is suggested that the high lipophilicity alone may not contribute to the protective effects of ACE inhibitors against LPC-induced hemolysis. None of ACE inhibitors attenuated the hypotonic hemolysis (60 mM NaCl), although propranolol did. Furthermore, neither propranolol (100 microM) nor quinaprilat (50 microM) and trandolaprilat (50 microM) affected LPC micelle formation, suggesting that these drugs do not directly bind to LPC. We therefore believe that the protective effects of quinaprilat and trandolaprilat on the LPC-induced hemolysis may be related physicochemically to their highly lipophilic and ACE inhibitory structures, which probably maintain erythrocyte membrane integrity by a mechanism other than ACE inhibition, prevention of LPC micelle formation or protection against osmotic imbalance.", 
    "717": "The effect of torasemide and furosemide therapy was compared in 50 patients who had chronic heart failure and symptoms [NYHA class II-III] despite long-term therapy with both low-dose furosemide and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. In this randomized 6-month, open-label trial, baseline and follow-up echocardiograms and neurohumoral assays were obtained in 25 group F patients (continued same dose of oral furosemide at 20-40 mg/day) and in 25 group T patients (received torasemide at 4-8 mg/day in place of furosemide). At 6 months, parameters were unchanged in group F whereas the group T patients had a lower left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (p<0.005) and left ventricular mass index (p<0.005) with improved Doppler filling parameters, decreased plasma B-type natriuretic concentration (p<0.001) and increased plasma concentrations of active renin (p<0.005) and aldosterone (p<0.001). The magnitude of these changes appeared dose dependent and it is suggested these favorable effects of switching from furosemide to torasemide may be related to aldosterone receptor blockade.", 
    "718": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have cardioprotective effects in animals, but whether that occurs in humans is still controversial. The effect of myocardial ACE activity on coronary vascular resistance during coronary artery bypass surgery and on serum brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) concentration after surgery was studied in myocardial tissue sampled from the right atrium of patients during cardiac surgery (n=20). Tissue enzyme activity (nmol/min per mg protein) was measured using a photometric technique, and the flow rate and pressure upon antegrade infusion of a crystalloid cardioplegic solution was measured for calculating the coronary vascular resistance (mmHg. ml(-1). min(-1)). Serum BNP concentration (pg/ml) was measured on days 0 and 5 after the surgery. Linear regression between tissue ACE activity and coronary vascular resistance (y = 0.46x + 0.56, r=0.85) as well as serum BNP concentration on days 0 (y = 129x + 30, r=0.59) and 5 (y = 347x + 180, r=0.73) after the surgery was significant (x: ACE activity; y: coronary vascular resistance/serum BNP concentration). The results indicate that inhibition of myocardial ACE activity might improve coronary circulation during surgery and hence, cardiac function after surgery.",

    "720": "Adverse reactions to dialyzers are a not very frequent, but because of the serious, sometimes fatal course, a dreaded complication of haemodialysis treatment. Most important among these reactions are hypersensitive reactions (anaphylactoid, reaction type A to dialyzer), which develop as a rule within the 10th minute of the procedure, and the reaction caused by the action of perfluorohydrocarbon which develop hours after onset or even completion of haemodialysis. Explanation of the development of hypersensitive reactions (HSR) by complement activation and formation of anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a during contact of blood with the bioincompatible dialysis membrane has been abandoned. Evidence of the etiological role of ethylene oxide (ETO) in the development of HSR influenced the selection of materials for the production of dialyzers and sterilization during manufacture, it emphasized the importance of rinsing of the dialyzer in the dialysis centre and led to the wide application of alternative methods of sterilization by gamma radiation and steam. HSR may be also caused by overproduction of bradykinin and inhibition of its degradation or degradation of its metabolites. Excessive bradykinin production caused by dialysis membranes with a negative charge is potentiated e.g. by a lower pH and increased plasma dilution in the initial stage of haemodialysis. Inhibition of bradykinin degradation develops during treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI). In prevention of HSR associated with bradykinin in addition to elimination of a combination of a negatively charged dialysis membrane and ACEI treatment a part is played also by rinsing of the dialyzer before haemodialysis with a bicarbonate solution and the modification of the membrane surface (implemented by the manufacturer) which reduces its negative charge. The first reaction to the dialyzer in conjunction with perfluorohydrocarbon (PF-5070), used in production of some dialyzers for testing the integrity of their capillaries were first described in 2001 and have caused since then at least 50 deaths. Reactions associated with PF-5070 are still the subject of research and forensic investigations. Despite this they draw already now attention to the failure in manufacture of dialyzers, to the inadequacy of hitherto accepted testing procedures of dialyzers and the constant necessity of careful clinical, laboratory and post-mortem examination of dialyzed patients.",

    "723": "In 5301 hypertensive patients, we found that a beta-blocker (atenolol) was the most commonly prescribed drug and was significantly more often prescribed for young male hypertensives (< 45 years). A relatively high dose of atenolol (100 mg/d) was extensively used as both mono- and combination-therapies. With the exception of middle-aged hypertensives (45-64 years) and elderly diabetic-hypertensives (> or = 65 years), no significant age- and gender-related differences were observed regarding the prescription of thiazide diuretics. A significant trend of prescribing methyldopa in females as monotherapy was evident. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, the second most commonly prescribed drugs, were significantly more often prescribed for young, middle-aged hypertensive males and for middle-aged diabetic-hypertensive males. beta-blocker/diuretic combination was prescribed least for the young and elderly hypertensive males. However, prescription of an ACE inhibitor with either a diuretic or a calcium channel blocker (CCBs) was less frequent and lacked gender-related differences.", 
    "724": "We infer that antihypertensive-induced SD received little attention as was evident from: (a) over-prescription of relatively high dose of beta-blockers to young hypertensive males; (b) lack of gender- and age-related difference regarding the type and dose of diuretics prescribed; (c) underutilization of effective and complementary combinations expected to cause least impact on sexual function, such as ACE inhibitors with either a diuretic or with a CCB; and (d) a relative lack of discrimination while selecting antihypertensive drugs, particularly as monotherapy between hypertensive versus diabetic-hypertensive patients. With the exception of ACE inhibitors alone and combination of diuretic/beta-blocker, the choice of antihypertensives did not conform to international guidelines. In view of drug-induced SD adversely influencing the quality of life and thereby drug-compliance, interventions aimed at improving physicians' awareness should be attempted.",

The aim of the study was to investigate the relationship between oxLDL and other oxidative stress biomarkers with stable coronary heart disease (CHD). We compared the degree of oxidative stress in patients with CHD and sex-matched healthy control subjects in a case-control study. The study included 64 male subjects: 32 patients with stable CHD and 32 normal control subjects. Levels of circulating oxLDL were measured by a monoclonal antibody 4E6-based competition ELISA. Comparison of oxidative stress marker levels between cases and controls, adjusted for age, revealed significantly higher plasma oxLDL levels (63.32+/-25.49 vs. 37.73+/-20.58 U/l, P=0.001), lower serum levels of autoantibodies against oxLDL (341.53+/-350.46 vs. 796.45+/-1034.2 mU/ml, P=0.021), higher activities of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase in erythrocytes (951+/-70.2 vs. 771.6+/-191.2 U/g, P=0.032) and glutathione peroxidase in whole blood (GSH-Px: 10714.4+/-3705.4 vs. 5512.2+/-1498.1 U/l, P<0.001).

PAF-AH activity and a panel of inflammatory mediators were measured in plasma of 496 patients with CAD and in 477 controls; 276 patients presented with stable angina pectoris and 220 with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Individuals within the highest quartile of PAF-AH activity had an 1.8-fold increase in CAD risk [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.01 to 3.2; P = 0.048] compared with those in the first quartile (adjusted for clinical and metabolic factors). When excluding individuals receiving statin and angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitor medication, individuals within the highest quartile of PAF-AH activity revealed a 3.9-fold increase in CAD risk (95% CI, 2.0 to 7.7; P < 0.0001). In these subjects, the plasma PAF-AH activity increased gradually in stable angina and in ACS both in men (P < 0.0001) and in women (P < 0.001), as compared with controls. No correlation was found between PAF-AH levels and those of common markers of inflammation. This study and the previous ones raise the important issue of whether PAF-AH is simply a marker of risk or directly promotes atherosclerosis.", 
    "743": "Heart failure (HF) is a complex clinical syndrome resulting from any structural or functional cardiac disorder impairing the ability of the ventricles to fill with or eject blood. The approach to pharmacologic treatment has become a combined preventive and symptomatic management strategy. Ideally, treatment should be initiated in patients at risk, preventing disease progression. In patients who have progressed to symptomatic left ventricular dysfunction, certain therapies have been demonstrated to improve survival, decrease hospitalizations, and reduce symptoms. The mainstay therapies are angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blockers (bisoprolol, carvedilol, and metoprolol XL/CR), with diuretics to control fluid balance. In patients who cannot tolerate ACE inhibitors because of angioedema or severe cough, valsartan can be substituted. Valsartan should not be added in patients already taking an ACE inhibitor and a beta-blocker. Spironolactone is recommended in patients who have New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III to IV symptoms despite maximal therapies with ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, diuretics, and digoxin. Low-dose digoxin, yielding a serum concentration <1 ng/mL can be added to improve symptoms and, possibly, mortality. The combination of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate might be useful in patients (especially in African Americans) who cannot tolerate ACE inhibitors or valsartan because of hypotension or renal dysfunction. Calcium antagonists, with the exception of amlodipine, oral or intravenous inotropes, and vasodilators, should be avoided in HF with reduced systolic function. Amiodarone should be used only if patients have a history of sudden death, or a history of ventricular fibrillation or sustained ventricular tachycardia, and should be used in conjunction with an implantable defibrillator [corrected]. Finally, anticoagulation is recommended only in patients who have concomitant atrial fibrillation or a previous history of cerebral or systemic emboli.", 
    "744": "The prevalence and incidence of chronic heart failure (HF) have now reached epidemic proportions. However, the issue of the prevention of HF has been raised only recently. New US guidelines have introduced a new classification system that includes 4 categories: patients at risk, patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction, patients with symptomatic HF, and those with refractory HF. Because coronary artery disease is the major cause of HF, its risk factors are also those of HF. Hypertension favors the development of HF through accelerated atherosclerosis and increased left ventricular wall stress and hypertrophy. Left ventricular hypertrophy is also a powerful risk factor for HF, independent of blood pressure. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta-blockers, and diuretics are the antihypertensive agents that have been associated with favorable effects in patients with overt HF. Therefore, they may be preferred in the prevention of this syndrome. Diabetes is the most frequent noncardiac comorbidity of HF and is independently associated with an increased risk. Normalization of glycemic and glycosylated hemoglobin levels is a desirable goal of treatment. However, no direct evidence exists in the prevention of HF. A greater control of the other risk factors (eg, hypertension, hyperlipidemia) is, on the other hand, particularly important. Beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors have both been shown to have favorable effects across all spectrums of severity of HF. The ACE inhibitor ramipril has also been shown to prevent the development of HF in patients at risk without left ventricular dysfunction. The role of antiplatelet agents, warfarin, and statins is clear in the prevention of the coronary artery disease. However, it has not been adequately assessed in patients with HF and awaits the results of ongoing trials.", 
    "745": "Symptomatic heart failure is preceded by a somewhat prolonged asymptomatic stage in many patients. The number of patients with asymptomatic heart dysfunction is about 4-fold greater than the number of patients with clinically overt heart failure. Pharmacologic treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers (in particular carvedilol) of asymptomatic patients with systolic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction can prevent or delay the occurrence of symptoms and reduce mortality in the long term. Thus, it would be of utmost importance to recognize and appropriately treat these patients before they develop heart failure symptoms. The cost-effectiveness of screening for asymptomatic heart dysfunction in the general population and in cohorts at risk has not been extensively evaluated. A normal electrocardiogram has a high negative predictive value in patients at risk. Echocardiography is the best tool for diagnosis and characterization of heart dysfunction, but extensive use is limited by availability and cost. Natriuretic peptides (brain natriuretic peptide and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide) are very sensitive markers of heart dysfunction and volume overload, and their measurement has been proposed as a first-line test to select patients who need echocardiography. The definition of the etiology of LV dysfunction--in particular, of the ischemic etiology--has prognostic and therapeutic implications. In addition to revascularization, pharmacologic treatment with antiplatelets and statins is helpful in preventing new ischemic events and the development of heart failure. The prevention, or at least the delay, of clinical manifestations of heart failure is strongly related to an effective approach to the asymptomatic stage. Therefore, it is important to educate the entire medical community, particularly physicians in the primary care setting, about recognition and treatment of these patients.",

Optimisation of the chemical and instrumental variables was carried out. Analyses were performed in 0.02 M borate buffer at pH 9.5 and 0.5 M KCl as ionic medium, using a pulse amplitude of 50 mV and a frequency of 150 Hz. A linear relationship between peak current and concentration was found in the interval 0.5-8 microg/ml for cilazapril and up to 6 microg/ml for quinapril and ramipril, allowing the direct determination of their pharmaceutical formulations alone or mixed with hydrochlorothiazide.

    "747": "HIV-associated nephropathy is a unique form of renal disease specific to HIV infection. Proteinuria and rapidly worsening azotemia in the absence of edema and hypertension are characteristic. Renal biopsy reveals collapsing and/or sclerotic glomeruli, microcystic tubular dilatation, and cellular interstitial infiltrates. Direct cytopathic effects of HIV in the setting of a particular cytokine milieu appears to be the mechanism responsible for the renal injury. There is limited therapeutic experience, but trials with steroids and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are encouraging. Dialysis is the main form of renal replacement therapy. Better understanding of the disease should improve treatment and prognosis.", 
    "748": "Prevalence of diabetic nephropathy is increasing. Understanding of pathogenesis and clinical picture helps to manage this disease. Recent data of the research of this disease support that the renin-angiotensin system plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis. Hyperglycaemia activates the renin-angiotensin system and induces transforming growth factor-beta expression. These both lead to glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Diabetic nephropathy develops earlier and progress faster in patients with DD or ID genotypes of angiotensin-I-converting-enzyme gene. Angiotensinogen and type 1 angiotensin-II-receptor gene mutations may be also predisposing factors for diabetic nephropathy. All these factors can be responsible for the hyperfiltration, albuminuria, salt sensitivity, and hypertension, which are characteristic features of diabetic nephropathy. According to these, one can suppose that inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system are effective in the prevention and treatment of this disease. Evidence of clinical studies suggests that angiotensin-I-converting-enzyme inhibitors in type 1 diabetes can prevent overt nephropathy, decrease proteinuria, inhibit the loss of the glomerular filtration and decelerate progression. Angiotensin-II-receptor blockers exert the same effect in type 2 diabetic patients, and presumably angiotensin-I-converting-enzyme inhibitors have similar activity in this group of patients. That is why, in the case of intolerance of one class of drugs, the other should be substituted. Combination therapy of angiotensin-I-converting-enzyme inhibitors with angiotensin-II-receptor blockers can be the choice of treatment in the future.", 
    "749": "The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system plays an important role in the regulation of electrolyte balance, body fluid volume and blood pressure. As yet, angiotensin II has been ascribed actions mediated by first type of receptors (AT1) such as increased blood pressure, antinatriuretic effect, cell proliferation. Since several years studies have been conducted on the role of second type receptor (AT2) through which angiotensin manifests its effects opposing those resulting from stimulation of type 1 receptor. They include: release of bradykinin and nitric oxide, vasodilation, natriuretic and antiproliferative effects. Blockade of the function of this receptor causes excessive reaction induced by action exerted on AT1 receptor.",

In this review, we present data to suggest that low systemic plasma renin activity in blacks may not be the primary abnormality, but rather the reflection of an overactive RAS at the tissue level in the kidney.", 
    "752": "The aim of this paper is to assess antihypertensive efficacy of b-blockers and their effects on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and all-cause mortality in elderly patients with hypertension. Randomized placebo-controlled trials, trials with untreated controls, and trials comparing antihypertensive drugs were selected from the literature. The relative risk reduction of primary endpoints and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. There were six trials in which elderly patients were treated with beta-blockers for hypertension (three trials were placebo-controlled, one trial had untreated controls, and two trials compared antihypertensive drugs). There was no study with monotherapy of beta-blockers. In combination with diuretics, beta-blockers were superior to placebo and untreated controls in preventing cardiovascular events, especially strokes, but there was no superiority of beta-blockers to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium antagonists in preventing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and total mortality in elderly patients with hypertension. Beta-blockers are only efficacious in combination with diuretics in preventing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in elderly patients with hypertension.", 
    "753": "A body of evidence indicates that microalbuminuria is a well-recognized marker of cardiovascular complications and increased cardiovascular risk in hypertension. However, the prognostic significance of microalbuminuria remains controversial because only the results of a few prospective studies performed in small groups of hypertensive subjects without diabetes mellitus are available. Several factors can affect the prevalence of microalbuminuria in hypertension including age, sex, race, severity of the disease, and concomitant risk factors. This accounts for the large differences in the prevalence of microalbuminuria that can be found in the literature, with prevalence rates going from a low of 4.7% to a high of 46%. The main determinant of albumin excretion rate in subjects with mild hypertension and no cardiovascular complications seems to be the hemodynamic load, whereas in subjects with more severe hypertension and associated target organ damage, the augmented urinary albumin leak is probably the consequence of glomerular damage. Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antagonists is particularly effective at reducing the albumin excretion rate, but whether these classes of drugs are more beneficial in patients with microalbuminuria remains to be determined. There is general consensus that evaluation of microalbuminuria is useful for the assessment of overall cardiovascular risk in hypertension, since albumin excretion rate appears to be a cost-effective way to identify patients at higher risk for whom additional preventive and therapeutic measures are advisable.", 
    "754": "High blood pressure in the setting of type 1 and type 2 diabetes is commonly associated with the earlier development of target-organ damage, including cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease and progressive renal insufficiency. The major goal of treating high blood pressure in this population is to prevent or reduce the likelihood of target-organ damage. The treatment goal for high blood pressure, therefore, has to be defined based on optimal means of preventing cardiovascular and renal events. The reduction of high blood pressure with pharmacologic therapy is associated with reduction of cardiovascular events, renal disease, and associated mortality. However, many questions remain. Some of the basic and important questions include the following: What should be the goal of treated blood pressure in the diabetic, and are there preferred agents that should be used in the hypertensive diabetic population? How do angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers fit in? Are there advantages of one class over the other? The goal of this review is to summarize the recent clinical trial findings and try to provide recommendations based on the evidence of these trials to help the clinician better choose blood pressure goals and treatment strategies in the diabetic population.", 
    "755": "The potential clinical effect of aspirin (ASA) in patients treated with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors is debatable. Several studies have suggested that ASA attenuates the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors in hypertension, congestive heart failure (CHF) or coronary artery disease (CAD) and have questioned the safety of using ASA concomitantly with these agents. The present study aims to investigate the possible interaction between ASA and ACE inhibitor in hypertensive rats. Hypertension was induced in adult male Wistar rats using Methylprednisolone (MP) 20 mg/kg per week s.c. for 2 weeks. The systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured by noninvasive BP technique. The effect of Lisinopril (LS) 15 mg/kg per day and that of combination of LS and ASA; 100 and 25 mg/kg per day p.o. was studied on hypertension induced by glucocorticoid. Concurrent ASA treatment with LS did not hinder the hypotensive effect of LS at either dose. However ASA 100 mg/kg per day caused mortality in animals and produced massive cardiac necrosis and renal damage as evident from histopathology. Treatment with ASA 25 mg/kg per day caused lower mortality with variable effects on cardiac and renal tissues. These results indicate that ASA attenuates the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitor on survival in hypertensive rats and this effect was more pronounced at higher dose of ASA.",

Incomplete suppression of the SNS may contribute to the residual mortality during optimal ACE inhibitor therapy in CHF. Carvedilol, a mixed alpha and beta-blocker with antioxidant properties, and other pure beta-adrenoceptor blockers reduce morbidity and mortality in Caucasians with CHF. However, beta-blocker monotherapy is of poor efficacy in Blacks with essential hypertension or in the treatment of glaucoma. The efficacy of beta-blockers in the treatment of African Americans with congestive heart failure is a controversial issue with conflicting findings.

Although no treatment differences were observed, a trend suggesting a greater improvement with enalapril + atenolol became apparent. By the fourth week, the sympathoplegic treatments, enalapril + atenolol, and enalapril + prazosin, caused significant reductions in the pressure rate product (-3726 +/- 1885 mm Hg x beats/min; -3498 +/- 396 mm Hg beats/min, respectively), (compared to enalapril alone (-1349 +/- 894 mm Hg x beats/min) (P<.001 ANOVA). During the Valsalva maneuver, the phase IV bradycardia were significantly greater after treatment with enalapril + atenolol (944 +/- 66 msec) or with enalapril + prazosin (825 +/- 48 msec), compared to enalapril alone (760 +/- 45 msec) (P<.001 ANOVA). The phase II Valsalva tachycardia were similar between treatments. The respiratory sinus arrhythmia ratio increased significantly (P<.005 ANOVA) and equally on all treatments. However, the pressor and chronotropic responses to forearm isometric handgrip increased significantly on the enalapril + prazosin combination (P<.02), compared to the other treatments.", 
    "759": "Our findings demonstrated not only the safety of providing additional therapy with alpha-1 or beta-1 receptor blockade concurrent with ACE inhibition in Blacks with CHF, but also the resultant improvement in exercise tolerance and NYHA class. Compared to using ACE inhibition alone, the combined therapies caused a marked reduction in the pressure rate product, an index of myocardial oxygen consumption, and a greater enhancement of cardiac parasympathetic activity. Selective beta-1 blockade caused a greater enhancement of central baroreceptor vagal activity compared to alpha-1 blockade. Conversely, the pressor and chronotropic abnormalities during forearm isometric handgrip in CHF, were normalized by alpha-1, but not beta-1, blockade. Thus, the combined reflex cardiac vagal augmentation following selective beta-1 blockade, and the hemodynamic effects of alpha-1 antagonism with concurrent ACE inhibition, may be of major therapeutic and prognostic benefit in Blacks with non-ischemic (hypertensive) CHF stabilized on digoxin and diuretics.",

In general, no significant differences were found between these regimes. Recently, the ALLHAT trial, which was the largest hypertension trial ever and in which over 40,000 patients with hypertension participated, was completed. The initial treatment consisted of either the diuretic chlorthalidone, the calcium entry blocker amlodipine, the ACE inhibitor lisinopril, or the alpha-blocker doxazosin. The latter arm was prematurely discontinued because of a higher incidence of the secondary endpoint heart failure and stroke. Based on an intention-to-treat analysis, the other types of treatment proved to be equivalent in terms of the primary endpoint, a composite of fatal coronary heart disease and non-fatal myocardial infarction.

It compared the cardiovascular effects of three more recently developed classes of antihypertensive agents to those of a diuretic in an attempt to identify which of these drugs should be the recommended first-line agent for the treatment of hypertension. In this report the paper is discussed with the significance and the clinical implications of the results contrasted with existing evidence in hypertension research. Additionally, further questions raised by the ALLHAT study are explored with ongoing studies, and future directions with which to answer these emerging new questions are outlined.", 
    "768": "The nonapeptide bradykinin (BK) is a Janus-faced hormone, which exerts pathophysiological as well as pronounced beneficial physiological effects, mainly by stimulation of BK B(2) receptors. In various animal models and in humans it has been shown that the stimulation of BK B(2) receptors is not only implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammation, pain and tissue injury but also in powerful cardioprotective mechanisms. Either exogenous administration of BK or locally increased BK concentrations as a consequence of the inhibition of its metabolic breakdown by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, reveal the significant contribution of BK in powerful cardioprotective mechanisms. These are mainly triggered by the synthesis and release of the vasorelaxant, anti-hypertrophic and anti-atherosclerotic endothelial mediators nitric oxide, prostaglandins and tissue-type plasminogen activator, by ischaemic preconditioning and by an increase in insulin sensitivity. Consequently, BK B(2) receptor agonists may have important clinical value in the treatment and prevention of various cardiovascular disorders such as hypertension, ischaemic heart disease, left ventricular hypertrophy, ventricular remodelling and congestive heart failure as well as diabetic disorders by mimicking the reported beneficial effects of BK. However, none of the currently known potent and selective peptide and non-peptide agonists of BK B(2) receptors--RMP-7 (lobradamil, Cereport; Alkermes), JMV-1116 (Fournier), FR-190997 (Fujisawa) and FR-191413 (Fujisawa)--have been selected for a clinical assessment in cardiovascular indications. One major challenge of this approach is the still unanswered question of whether there is a sufficient safe therapeutic window between potential cardioprotective and pro-inflammatory effects following BK B(2) receptor agonism.",

We investigated the effects of enalapril (E), an ACE-inhibitor, on rat kidneys with either UUO or HOX. Sham-operated, UUO, HOX, UUO+HOX, UUO+E and HOX+E rats were killed 14 days after UUO and/or HOX was initiated. Rat kidney sections were histologically scored for tissue damage and monocyte/macrophage infiltration was demonstrated with ED1 antibody and measured by computer image analysis software. Serious glomerular and tubulointerstitial damage was found for UUO and HOX, consisting of glomerular basement membrane thickening, tubular dilatation/collapse, tubular basement membrane thickening and the infiltration of mononuclear leucocytes (mainly macrophages). For HOX, calcium oxalate crystals were visible. Neither the scored histological parameters nor monocyte/macrophage infiltration was significantly decreased when E-treated were compared with untreated groups. We conclude that E did not ameliorate the parameters scored in either UUO or HOX. This being contrary to findings by other research groups, we hypothesize that E may be effective only in short-term UUO/HOX, with transforming growth factor, TGF-beta1, formation becoming partly independent of Ang II in late-stage UUO/HOX, or other fibrogenic cytokines than TGF-beta1 becoming predominant.",

If necessary, hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg) was added to each compound. We evaluated brachial artery flow-mediated, endothelium-dependent dilation (high-resolution ultrasound) compared with endothelium-independent response to glyceryl trinitrate (25 microg/s). Brachial artery diameter was measured by automatic computerized analysis. Forty healthy subjects were evaluated as a control group. Oxidative stress production was evaluated by measuring plasma malondialdehyde and plasma lipoperoxides; plasma antioxidant capacity was assessed as ferric-reducing antioxidant power. Hypertensive patients showed a significantly (P<0.01) lower flow-mediated dilation (5.2+/-1.9%) as compared with healthy control subjects (7.1+/-2.6%). Response to glyceryl trinitrate was similar in control subjects and patients. At baseline, blood pressure, diameter, flow-mediated dilation, and response to glyceryl trinitrate were similar in the different treatment groups. All treatments similarly reduced blood pressure, but only perindopril increased flow mediated dilation (from 5.1+/-2 to 6.4+/-2.4%; P<0.01) without modifying the response to glyceryl trinitrate. Perindopril but also telmisartan nifedipine and amlodipine reduced oxidative stress and increased plasma antioxidant capacity. In patients with essential hypertension, ACE inhibitors appear to be the only compounds able to improve conduit artery endothelium-dependent vasodilation.",

    "780": "This study examined the effects of long term cholesterol lowering therapy with simvastatin on progression and regression of coronary atherosclerosis, as determined by quantitative angiographic end points, in subgroups of patients with known coronary risk factors. In this randomized, placebo controlled clinical trial, the effect of simvastatin on coronary atherosclerosis was compared with that of placebo in 394 patients who had paired coronary angiograms taken an average of four years apart. The effects of treatment on the following prespecified subgroups were examined: sex, age (less than 65 years versus at least 65 years), smoking status (current or previous/never), history of diabetes mellitus or hypertension, and severity of coronary artery lesions (diameter at least 50% versus less than 50%). There were significantly smaller decreases in the average minimum diameters, between closeout and baseline angiograms, in all simvastatin-treated subgroups, compared with placebo. Trends toward or significantly smaller decreases in the average of the mean diameters, and similar smaller increases in percentage diameter stenosis were also seen in all subgroups. The slowing of angiographically demonstrable coronary atherosclerotic narrowing supports the contention that this treatment effect is causally related to the reduction of coronary events repeatedly seen in large outcome clinical trials of lipid lowering therapy. Also, this treatment effect occurs in the presence or absence of the traditional coronary risk factors.", 
    "781": "Inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACEI) after myocardial infarction reduces remodeling of the surviving myocardium. The cellular signaling mechanisms contributing to remodeling are not fully elucidated. Goal of the current study was to test whether protein kinase C (PKC) is regulated in the surviving myocardium shortly after infarction and whether this regulation is influenced by ACEI. Rats were subjected to anterior wall myocardial infarction in vivo or sham operation. After 15-45 min, mRNA levels and protein expression of the major cardiac PKC isoforms were measured in the ischemic and the remote myocardium. The influence of ACEI on PKC was tested by pretreating the rats with ramiprilat. In the ischemic region of the myocardium, a significant increase of the mRNA for PKC-delta and PKC-epsilon was observed in close correlation with increased isoform protein expression. In the surviving, remote myocardium, however, only PKC-epsilon expression was significantly augmented both at the mRNA level (158%) and at the protein level (149%). PKC-delta and PKC-alpha were unchanged. Treatment with ramiprilat could abolish this isoform-specific PKC regulation in both areas. These data characterize for the first time an isoform-specific transcriptional regulation process of PKC in the surviving myocardium after infarction. This induction of PKC-epsilon can be prevented by ACEI. It is speculated that PKC-epsilon plays a role in the signal transduction of early remodeling after infarction.", 
    "782": "Adenylyl cyclase (AC) messenger RNA (mRNA) expression is decreased in failing hearts. Diminished expressions are accompanied by desensitization of beta-adrenergic signal transduction. Factors contributing to such changes in mRNA expression for the major myocardial isoform AC V are not well established. To assess the contributions of hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAS), and the sympathetic nervous system to these changes, ventricular expression of AC V mRNA was measured at different ages in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). In addition, the effects on them of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists were determined. Prior to quantitative Northern blotting at ages 5, 9, or 12 weeks, hemodynamic and morphologic variables were measured in SHRs and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKYs). The SHRs and WKYs were treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril (10 mg/kg/d), or a beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist, atenolol (100 mg/kg/d), for 8 weeks preceding Northern analysis. Myocardial AC V mRNA expression increased from 5-12 weeks in both SHRs and WKYs. Expression of AC V mRNA in SHRs increased somewhat less than in WKYs at 9 weeks and significantly less at 12 weeks. This was accompanied by development of LVH and hypertension in SHRs. Blood pressure and left ventricular weight relative to body weight were markedly decreased by enalapril and were moderately decreased by atenolol. Expression of AC V mRNA in SHRs at 12 weeks was normalized equally by enalapril and atenolol to the level of WKYs. Thus AC V mRNA expression increases are blunted in the early stages of LVH in SHRs under the influences of beta(1)-adrenergic signal transduction and the RAS.",

The biochemical and biological features of these peptides were crucial to demonstrate the pivotal role of the angiotensin-converting enzyme in blood pressure regulation. In the present study, seven bradykinin-potentiating peptides were identified within the C-type natriuretic peptide precursor cloned from snake brain. The bradykinin-potentiating peptides deduced from the B. jararaca brain precursor are strong in vitro inhibitors of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (nanomolar range), and also potentiate the bradykinin effects in ex vivo and in vivo experiments. Two of these peptides are novel bradykinin-potentiating peptides, one of which displays high specificity toward the N-domain active site of the somatic angiotensin-converting enzyme. In situ hybridization studies revealed the presence of the bradykinin-potentiating peptides precursor mRNAs in distinct regions of the B. jararaca brain, such as the ventromedial hypothalamus, the paraventricular nuclei, the paraventricular organ, and the subcommissural organ. The biochemical and pharmacological properties of the brain bradykinin-potentiating peptides, their presence within the neuroendocrine regulator C-type natriuretic peptide precursor, and their expression in regions of the snake brain correlated to neuroendocrine functions, strongly suggest that these peptides belong to a novel class of endogenous vasoactive peptides.", 
    "792": "Childhood nephrotic syndrome is a rare condition with an incidence of 1-2 per 100000 children aged below 16 years. Untreated idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS) is associated with increased risks of life-threatening infection, thromboembolism, lipid abnormalities, and malnutrition. The aim of the management of INS in children is to induce and maintain complete remission with resolution of proteinuria and edema without serious adverse effects of therapy. The majority of children have corticosteroid sensitive idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (CSINS), and in these children, corticosteroid therapy is the mainstay of therapy to induce remission. Data from a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) indicate that prolonged courses of corticosteroids (up to 7 months) given in the first episode of CSINS reduce the risk of relapse. Nevertheless, many children relapse, and are at risk of corticosteroid toxicity if frequent courses of corticosteroids are required. Data from RCTs supports the use of alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil), cyclosporine, and levamisole in these children to achieve prolonged periods of remission. The specific management of corticosteroid-resistant idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (CRINS) is more difficult since few therapies are consistently effective, and data from RCTs are limited. In such children, cyclosporine, alkylating agents, and high dose intravenous methylprednisone may be used. In addition to specific therapies for INS, supportive therapies are commonly used to control edema (loop diuretics, aldosterone antagonists, albumin infusions, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors), reduce the risk of infection (antibacterials, pneumococcal vaccination) and thromboembolism (aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid]), and to control hyperlipidemia (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors), especially in children with CRINS.",

We recruited 36 patients aged 56 +/- 11 years, with systolic blood pressure > or = 160 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure > or = 95 mmHg. Patients were assigned either to treatment by long-acting ACEI (n = 12) or CCB (n = 24). All patients were followed for 12 months. Optimal BP was achieved by two optional increases in treatment: dose-doubling of the primary drug during the first three months and the addition of diuretics or beta-blockers thereafter. Target blood pressure was 140/90 mmHg or a fall > or = 20/10 mmHg. Baroreflex sensitivity was examined by spectral analysis of blood pressure and RR interval variabilities before treatment and after 3 and 12 months of treatment. The flow-mediated vasodilator function was determined before and 12 months after treatment by measuring the change in brachial artery diameter during increases in flow induced by reactive hyperemia.",

On the other hand, in Japan, calcium antagonist (Ca-A) and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) have been two major medications of initial therapy for hypertension, while angiotensin II receptor antagonist (ARB), which has recently been introduced, is also used now widely as an initial therapy.

    "799": "The aim of this study was to determine the effect of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), initiated within 24 hours of an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), on the QT dispersion (QTd). ACEIs have proven beneficial in improving left ventricular remodeling, following an AMI while contributing to a reduction in sudden cardiac death (SCD). A prolonged QTd is a marker of electrical instability predisposing to ventricular arrhythmias and SCD. No one has looked at the effects on the QTd of ACEI therapy initiated within 24 hours of an AMI. The study included 239 consecutive patients who presented with an AMI between January 1, 1998 and December 31, 1998. A total of 105 patients had never been treated with an ACEI, and 51 patients were started on enalapril within 24 hours of presentation. Patient demographics were similar in both groups. All patients were treated with aspirin and beta-blocker therapy. A baseline QTd was determined and recalculated on days 3-4 and 6-7 following the AMI. There was no significant difference in the baseline QTd, heart rate, QTc(min), and QTc(max) between the two groups. On days 3-4 the QTd in the treatment group (A) was 39.2 +/- 19.4 ms, as opposed to 84.4 +/- 31.2 ms in the control group (B) (P = 1.0E-06). This reduction in QTd was accounted for by a significant difference in the QTc(max). The QTd shortened in both groups on days 6-7 with a QTd of 30.0 +/- 17.5 in group A and a QTd of 54.1 +/- 26.3 in group B (P = 1.0E-05). There was a significant difference in ejection fraction (EF) between the two groups with the ACEI treated group exhibiting a lower EF, (0.403 (A), 0.494 (B), P < 0.043). The mean dose of enalapril was 6.45 mg daily in the treatment group. ACEIs have been previously shown to reduce the QTd after two months of therapy following an AMI. This study shows that the beneficial effects of ACEI occur early following administration of the drug. The authors speculate that the reduction in SCD conferred by ACEI therapy may be attributed to its effect on reducing the degree of ventricular dispersion of repolarization following a myocardial infarction.", 
    "800": "The current prescription patterns for essential hypertension and the efficacy, safety, tolerability and cost-effectiveness of the newer antihypertensive drugs were evaluated in Nigerian patients. The findings were compared with that of a previous study conducted in the same tertiary hospital 10 years earlier. A cross-sectional evaluation of blood pressure (BP) control in a hypertension clinic was undertaken among 150 Nigerian patients aged 61 +/- 12 years (55% females), with a duration of treatment on a particular drug class or combination of 9 +/- 3 months. The initial blood pressure was 176 +/- 20/108 +/- 11 mmHg and 22% of the patient had concurrent diabetes mellitus. Thiazide diuretics (D) alone or in combination remained the most commonly prescribed drugs in 56% of all patients. There were significant increases in the prescriptions of calcium channel blockers (CCBs) (51%), P < 0.0001, and ACE-inhibitors (ACEIs) (24%), P < 0.0001, but a slight reduction in the use of methyldopa, and fixed drug combinations (P < 0.01) compared to the previous study. The fall in systolic blood pressure on D (r = 0.65, P < 0.001) or CCB (r = 0.48, P < 0.02) was significantly correlated with the initial systolic blood pressure, but not age. More patients achieved normotension BP < 140/90 mmHg on CCB monotherapy (71%), than D monotherapy (56%). Combination therapy with ACEIs + D or methyldopa+thiazides normalized BP in 63 and 68%, respectively. Pulse pressure, a surrogate marker for cardiovascular complications and mortality in essential hypertension, was significantly reduced (P < 0.01) equally by all treatments, with 95% confidence intervals ranging from -28 to -1 mmHg. However, hypertensive-diabetic (HT-DM) patients (n = 33) exhibited no significant change in pulse pressure in response to treatment. Adverse drug reactions that occurred in 11% were impotence or postural dizziness with D, headache and pitting oedema with CCB, and dry cough with ACEI. Pharmaco-economic comparison of the drug classes revealed that for every US dollar (dollar) spent per month, the percentage of treated patients attaining normotension was 18.6 for D, 4.73 for CCB, 3.5 for ACEI + D and 13.6 for methyldopa + thiazides. A combination of ACEI + CCB or D was the preferred treatment for hypertensive-diabetic Nigerians, but only 24% attained a BP < 130/85 mmHg. These results demonstrate a shift in trend to a more rational and efficacious treatment of hypertension over a 10 year period. This may be associated, at least in part, with the intensive and continuous education of the prescribers in rational drug use and the introduction of a hospital formulary. Methyldopa is still a highly efficacious and cost-effective drug in this population. Black HT-DM Africans still constitute a subgroup who not only require more and costlier antihypertensive drugs, but whose BP control is suboptimal, and exhibit a poor therapeutic response to other risk factors (pulse pressure) that constitute a continuing risk for cardiovascular mortality.",

On the other hand, discrete interstitial ventricular myocardial fibrosis observed in l-NAME-treated rats, either hypertensive or rendered normotensive with captopril, clearly indicates that this response depends on a process associated with NO insufficiency.", 
    "809": "Development of high blood pressure (BP) is associated with an increased expression of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) in vascular smooth muscle cells.", 
    "810": "We investigated whether or not changes in intraluminal pressure affect nNOS expression in carotid arteries of normotensive rats. Expression of nNOS and other NOS isoforms was determined by Western blot analysis in rat carotid arteries maintained up to 24 h at different levels of intraluminal pressure in an organ culture system.", 
    "811": "Expression of nNOS in arteries exposed to 80 mmHg was stable for the duration of the experiment. Increasing intraluminal pressure to 200 mmHg transiently augmented nNOS expression at 9 h, both in intact arteries and in arteries where the endothelium and the adventitia were removed. The expression of endothelial NOS (eNOS) was also augmented under similar experimental conditions, but only after 24 h exposure. The ERK1/2 kinase cascade inhibitor PD 98059 significantly impaired the expression of nNOS in arteries exposed to 200 mmHg for 9 h. However, the angiotensin AT(1) antagonist candesartan and the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor perindoprilat did not have any effect under the same experimental conditions. Finally, the preferential nNOS inhibitor S-methyl-L-thiocitrulline significantly augmented the contraction evoked by angiotensin II in arteries exposed to 200 mmHg, but not in those maintained at 80 mmHg intraluminal pressure for 9 h.", 
    "812": "These results show that transmural pressure increases nNOS expression and NO release in rat smooth muscle cells by a mechanism involving the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, but independent from the local formation of angiotensin II.",

    "814": "A total of 27 untreated hypertensives were randomized to receive lisinopril 20 mg o.d. or losartan 50 mg o.d. for 5 weeks and were subsequently crossed-over to the alternative treatment for a second 5-week period. Twenty-four hour ambulatory and 5-day home blood pressure were monitored before randomization and at the end of each treatment period. TPR, MER and SI were calculated for each drug for the total study population and for responders only.", 
    "815": "When all patients were considered, lisinopril provided higher values of TPR [0.63/0.66 for systolic/diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP)], MER (1.02/0.77) and SI (1.01/0.87) than losartan (0.35/0.51, 0.60/0.60 and 0.64/0.53, respectively). Analysis of responders only, again showed a clear advantage of lisinopril over losartan in TPR (0.77/0.67 versus 0.44/0.47, respectively) and MER (0.86/0.87 versus 0.48/0.61), whereas there was no difference in SI (1.25/1.13 for lisinopril versus 1.11/1.12 for losartan).", 
    "816": "These data suggest that the assessment of the duration of the antihypertensive drug effect provided by the MER is consistent to that by the TPR and that two drugs with different levels of TPR and MER may have the same level of SI. It appears that the SI is not simply a more reliable index of the features of the antihypertensive drug effect, but offers a different type of information complementary to that provided by the TPR and the MER, in regard to the homogeneity and the magnitude but not the duration of the antihypertensive effect.", 
    "817": "To examine the behavioral and neural control of body fluid homeostasis, water and saline intake of C57BL/6 mice was monitored under ad libitum conditions, after treatments that induce water or salt intake, and after ablation of the periventricular tissue of the anteroventral third ventricle (AV3V). Mice have nocturnal drinking that is most prevalent after the offset and before the onset of lights. When given ad libitum choice, C57BL/6 mice show no preference for saline over water at concentrations up to 0.9% NaCl and a progressive aversion to saline above that concentration. Systemic hypertonic saline, isoproterenol, and polyethylene glycol treatments are dipsogenic; however, systemic ANG II is not. Intracerebroventricular injections of both hypertonic saline and ANG II are dipsogenic, and diuretic treatment followed by a short period of sodium deprivation induces salt intake. After ablation of the AV3V, mice can be nursed to recovery from initial adipsia and, similar to rats, show chronic deficits to dipsogenic treatments. Taken together, the data indicate that mechanisms controlling thirst in response to cellular dehydration in C57BL/6 mice are similar to rats, but there are differences in the efficacy of extracellular dehydration-related mechanisms, especially for systemic ANG II, controlling thirst and salt appetite.", 
    "818": "The aim of the study was to investigate mechanisms underlying the downregulation of renal blood flow (RBF) after a prolonged reduction in renal perfusion pressure (RPP) in adult spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). We tested the effect on the RBF response of clamping plasma ANG II in sevoflurane-anesthetized SHR. We also tested the effect of general cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition and inhibition of the inducible COX-2. Furthermore, we assessed the effect of clamping the nitric oxide (NO) system. A prolonged period (15 min) of reduced RPP induced a downregulation of RBF. This was unchanged after clamping of plasma ANG II concentrations, general COX inhibition, and specific inhibition of COX-2. In contrast, clamping the NO system diminished the ability of SHR to downregulate RBF to a lower level. The downregulation of RBF was not associated with a resetting of the lower limit of autoregulation in the control group, in the ANG II-clamped group, or the NO clamped group. However, general COX inhibition and specific COX-2 inhibition enabled downward resetting of the lower limit of autoregulation. In conclusion, in SHR the renin-angiotensin system does not appear to play a major role in the downregulation of RBF after prolonged reduction of RPP. This response appears to be mediated partly by the NO system. We hypothesize that, in SHR, lack of downward resetting of the lower limit of autoregulation in response to a prolonged lowering of RPP could be the result of increased COX-2-mediated production of vasoconstrictory prostaglandins.", 
    "819": "We recently described a chymostatin-sensitive elastase-2 as the major angiotensin (ANG) II-forming enzyme in the perfusate of the rat mesenteric arterial bed (MAB) with the same cDNA sequence as rat pancreatic elastase-2. The role of this enzyme in generating ANG II was examined in the rat isolated and perfused MAB. The vasoconstrictor effect elicited by ANG I and the renin substrate tetradecapeptide was only partially inhibited by captopril but abolished by the combination of captopril and chymostatin or N-acetyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Leu-chloromethylketone (Ac-AAPL-CK; inhibitor originally developed for human elastase-2). The effect induced by [Pro11,d-Ala12]-ANG I, an ANG I-converting enzyme (ACE)-resistant biologically inactive precursor of ANG II, was blocked by chymostatin or Ac-AAPL-CK. It was also demonstrated that cultured rat mesenteric endothelial cells synthesize elastase-2 and that mRNA for this enzyme can be detected in different rat tissues such as the pancreas, MAB, lung, heart, kidney, liver, and spleen. In conclusion, the demonstration of a functional alternative pathway to ACE for ANG II generation in the rat MAB and the fact that cultured MAB endothelial cells are capable of producing and secreting elastase-2 represent strong evidence of a physiological role for this enzyme in the rat vasculature.",

    "825": "430 consecutive subjects (70+/-14 years, 55% male, 41% with coronary artery disease) released from the hospital with a primary diagnosis of heart failure were classified into three groups based on the use of aspirin and ACE-I at discharge: ACE-I without aspirin (group I, n=134), ACE-I with aspirin (group II, n=138) and no ACE-I (group III, n=158). Follow-up (all-cause mortality and the composite end-point of mortality or emergent heart transplant) was available in 406 (94%) patients at a median duration of 28 months. Differences in outcomes between patient groups were compared using contingency tables, Kaplan-Meier survival, and Cox regression analyses. Similar analyses were conducted in four predefined subsets (patients with and without coronary artery disease, and those with left ventricular ejection fraction <or=45%, and >45%).", 
    "826": "Death and the composite end-point occurred in 155 (38%) and 165 (41%) patients, respectively. In the total cohort as well as in the four subsets, the treatment group showed no association with clinical outcomes in univariate or multivariate analyses.",

    "828": "Aldosterone has long been known to mediate water and electrolyte balance by acting on mineralocorticoid receptors in the kidneys. However, recent studies have demonstrated the presence of these receptors in nonclassical locations, including the brain, blood vessels, and the heart. This finding suggests that aldosterone may play a larger role than once appreciated in normal physiologic function and cardiovascular disease. Some of the adverse cardiovascular effects that have been described include cardiac and vascular fibrosis, left ventricular hypertrophy, congestive heart failure, hypertension, endothelial dysfunction, reduced fibrinolysis, and cardiac arrhythmias. In light of these findings, aldosterone receptor blockers have become increasingly more important. This is especially true considering the fact that traditional therapies, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II-receptor blockers, may not be effective in maintaining long-term suppression of aldosterone. Therefore, a great deal of focus has been placed on spironolactone, which has proven to be an effective, albeit nonselective, aldosterone receptor blocker. The Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study has shown that spironolactone results in a 30% reduction in mortality among patients with severe congestive heart failure. Other studies have shown spironolactone to lower high blood pressure, improve endothelial dysfunction, reduce left ventricular hypertrophy, and lower the incidence of fatal arrhythmias. However, spironolactone, because of its interaction with other steroid receptors, is not without its limitations, which include gynecomastia, breast tenderness, menstrual irregularities, and impotence. As a result, eplerenone (INSPRA), a selective aldosterone blocker, is currently being investigated for its efficacy and side-effect profile compared with spironolactone. Eplerenone has already been approved for the treatment of systemic hypertension, and several clinical trials are currently underway to identify other therapeutic uses for this agent in cardiovascular disease management.",

    "845": "The objective of this article is to review the aetiology, epidemiology, diagnosis, clinical course, treatment and prognosis of peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM). The medical literature from 1966 to March 2002 was reviewed through MEDLINE. PPCM is a rare complication in pregnancy. It is seen in late pregnancy or in the early puerperium. The aetiology of this disease remains uncertain. Many possible causes have been proposed, including myocarditis, abnormal immune response to pregnancy, maladaptive response to the hemodynamic stresses of pregnancy and prolonged tocolysis. Risk factors for PPCM include advanced maternal age, multiparity, African descent, twinning and long-term tocolysis. Patients with systolic dysfunction during pregnancy are treated the same as patients who are not pregnant. The mainstays of medical therapy are digoxin, loop diuretics, sodium restriction and afterload reducing agents (hydralazine and nitrates). Due to a high risk for venous and arterial thrombosis, anticoagulation with heparin should be instituted. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers should be avoided during pregnancy because of severe adverse neonatal effects. The utility of immunosuppressive therapy remains ambiguous. Advances in medical therapy for dilated cardiomyopathy and cardiac transplantation have significantly improved the quality of life and survival for patients.", 
    "846": "We examined antiarrhythmic effects of drugs, including renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors, on reperfusion arrhythmias in rats in vivo. Anesthetized rats were subjected to 5 min of coronary occlusion and 30 min of reperfusion. Arrhythmia scores, calculated as the product of the type of arrhythmia (1 for ventricular tachycardia, 2 for ventricular fibrillation) and its duration (in seconds), were adopted to evaluate the severity of arrhythmias. Reperfusion arrhythmias were suppressed by Na(+)/H(+) exchange inhibitor, Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange inhibitor and L-type Ca channel antagonist by more than 90%. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin II (Ang II) type 1 receptor (AT(1)) antagonist also modestly (by 60-70%) but significantly decreased reperfusion arrhythmias. These effects were not reversed by co-administration of bradykinin B(2) receptor antagonist or AT(2) antagonist, respectively. Effects of superoxide dismutase (SOD) were also examined, but SOD proved ineffective. Effects of Na(+)/H(+) exchange inhibitor, Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange inhibitor and L-type Ca channel antagonist suggest a causative relationship of Ca overload in reperfusion arrhythmias. These transport systems are known to be activated by Ang II. Thus, the antiarrhythmic action of RAS inhibitors might be attributable to the inhibition of the action of Ang II via AT(1).", 
    "847": "The elderly population is expanding rapidly throughout the world. Hypertension, heart disease and other cardiovascular disorders are prevalent conditions among this age group. Consequently, clinicians will spend a large proportion of their practices managing older adults with cardiovascular disorders. A large proportion of this time will be devoted to using pharmacotherapeutic strategies for the long-term management of chronic conditions. The physiological changes that accompany aging affect cardiovascular function, and the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of many cardiovascular medications are altered by these physiological changes. The interactions of these changes can have a profound effect on the agents used to treat cardiovascular disorders and may alter their therapeutic outcomes. Several classes of medications are used to treat chronic cardiovascular disorders in older adults. These include the ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists, calcium channel antagonists, beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (beta-blockers), oral antiarrhythmic agents and warfarin. Drugs such as beta-blockers may aggravate decreased cardiac output and increase peripheral resistance, but are valuable adjuncts in many patients with congestive heart failure. Agents that reduce angiotensin II activity may have several benefits for treating heart failure and hypertension. Successful treatment of cardiovascular disorders in older adults requires the choice of the most appropriate agent, taking into consideration the complex interactions of pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and disease effects.", 
    "848": "Renal artery stenosis (RAS) may cause hypertension, azotemia, episodes of flash pulmonary edema and congestive heart failure. Renal artery angioplasty and stenting was performed in 207 patients from 1991 to 1997. Thirty-nine of these patients (19%) underwent renal artery stenting for the control of recurrent episodes of congestive heart failure and flash pulmonary edema. All patients had angiographic evidence of severe (>70%) bilateral RAS (n = 18) or severe RAS to a solitary functioning kidney (n = 21). Sixteen patients (41%) were male and 23 (59%) were female, mean age 69.9 years (range 50-85 years). Of the 18 patients with bilateral RAS, 12 (66.6%) underwent bilateral stenting. Mean blood pressure decreased from 174/85 +/- 32/23 mmHg to 148/72 +/- 24/14 mmHg (p < 0.001). Mean number of blood pressure medications decreased from 3 +/- 1 to 2.5 +/- 1 (p = 0.006). Twenty-eight patients (71.8%) had improvement in blood pressure control. The mean serum creatinine decreased from 3.16 +/- 1.61 to 2.65 +/- 1.87 (p = 0.06). Six of 39 patients (15.4%) used angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors prior to stenting whereas 19 of 39 patients (48.7%) used ACE inhibitors poststenting (p = 0.004). Twenty of 39 patients (51.4%) demonstrated improvement in serum creatinine, 10 of 39 patients (25.6%) had stabilization of serum creatinine and nine of 39 patients (23%) demonstrated worsening. The number of hospitalizations due to congestive heart failure in the year preceding renal artery stenting was 2.4 +/- 1.4 and poststenting was 0.3 +/- 0.7 (p < 0.001). The New York Heart Association Functional Class decreased from 2.9 +/- 0.9 prestenting to 1.6 +/- 0.9 poststenting (p < 0.001). Thirty of 39 patients (77%) had no hospitalizations for congestive heart failure during a mean follow-up period of 21.3 months. Nine patients expired during the course of follow up; eight of the nine patients died within the first year after renal artery stenting. Renal artery stenting decreased the frequency of congestive heart failure, flash pulmonary edema, and the need for hospitalization in most patients. Blood pressure was markedly improved in the majority of patients with improved or stabilized renal function. Evaluation for RAS is important in hypertensive patients who present with recurrent congestive heart failure or flash pulmonary edema.",

Chart review was conducted on members with a discharge diagnosis of CHF (n = 2,697). Information was entered onto a scannable form designed by the health plan, which was coupled to an optical character recognition reader and entered into a database. Eighty-four percent of the patients had an ejection fraction (EF) measured. An angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor was prescribed to 72% of patients with an EF less than 40%. Comorbidities and other measures were evaluated and based on guideline recommendations. Most of the CHF patients in this health plan are being treated appropriately during posthospitalization for CHF. The use of a novel, cost-effective method for data collection resulted in the rapid acquisition of clinical data for analysis.", 
    "850": "Blood vessels are remodeled in hypertension both structurally and functionally. The changes that occur in their structure, mechanical properties, and function contribute to blood pressure elevation and to complications of hypertension. We studied the remodeling of small arteries in experimental animals and humans. Smooth muscle cells of small arteries are restructured around a smaller lumen, with significant remodeling of the extracellular matrix and collagen and fibronectin deposition. Interestingly, there is no evidence of net growth of the vascular wall (which results in so-called eutrophic remodeling), particularly in the milder forms of human essential hypertension. Hypertrophic remodeling and increased small artery stiffness may be found in more severe forms of hypertension. Almost all hypertensive patients have vascular structural remodeling. However, only some exhibit endothelial dysfunction. This is particularly true in mild hypertension, in which endothelial dysfunction is less common. A 1-year treatment of hypertensive patients with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonists, and long acting calcium channel blockers corrected small artery structure and, to variable degrees depending on the agents used, impaired endothelial function. In contrast, beta blockers did not improve structure, function, or mechanics of vessels. When beta-blocker-treated patients were switched to an AT1 receptor antagonist, small artery structure and impaired endothelial function were corrected. The vascular protective action of some antihypertensive agents may contribute to improve outcome for hypertensive patients, although this is presently unproven.", 
    "851": "Angiotensin II (Ang II) mediates its effects through its non-tyrosine-kinase G protein coupled Ang-II type 1 receptor (AT1). Growing evidence indicates that a functional insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) tyrosine kinase receptor is required for Ang-II-induced mitogenesis. Along with Ang II, we have previously shown that changes in IGF-1 receptor binding at myofibers are causative agents for cardiac eccentric hypertrophy. This study investigated the interaction of the renin-angiotensin system with the IGF-1 receptor during the development and regression of cardiac hypertrophy. Alterations in IGF-1 binding were evaluated in the CHAPS-pretreated perfused heart. Four weeks of aortocaval shunt increased relative heart mass by 76% without a major change in body mass or systolic blood pressure. Binding studies showed that IGF-1 has a higher affinity for the cardiac myofibers of shunt than sham rats. Two weeks of treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril (0.5 g/L in drinking water) or the AT1-antagonist losartan (10 mg/(kg x day)) reduced cardiac hypertrophy by 54 and 42%, respectively. However, while both ACE inhibition and AT1-antagonist treatments produced equivalent regression in ventricular hypertrophy, captopril was more efficacious than losartan in the regression of atrial hypertrophy. Regression of cardiac hypertrophy in the shunt by either captopril or losartan was accompanied with a reduction or normalization of the elevated IGF-1 affinity. Thus, the induction and regression of cardiac eccentric hypertrophy seems to be largely dependent on cross talk between the renin-angiotensin system and the IGF-1 axis at the receptor level.", 
    "852": "From March to July 1999, 940 private cardiologists in France recruited 100,429 patients of whom 30,430 (30%) had a previous history of atherothrombotic disease. The prevalence of patients with a previous history of Myocardial Infarction (MI), Ischemic Stroke (IS) or Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) was 19.7%, 7.2% and 10.7% respectively. Among patients with a history of atherothrombotic disease, myocardial infarction was the most frequent diagnosis responsible for 65% of all consultations. Each cardiologist described the secondary prevention treatment for 3 consecutive patients among whom 1 corresponded to each of the 3 atherothrombotic territories. The most frequent cardiovascular risk factors were hypercholesterolemia for myocardial infarction (77.9%), smoking for PAD (32.5%) and hypertension for IS (73.2%). Diabetes mellitus (1/4 patients), obesity (1/3) and sedentary way of life (1/3) were equally prevalent for each of the atherothrombotic territories. More than 90% of the patients received an antithrombotic drug. Antiplatelet agents were largely prescribed, anticoagulants being more frequently used for patients with atrial fibrillation, symptomatic cardiac heart failure or stroke of embolic origin. Thienopyridines represent 17.9% of the prescriptions. The prescription rate of statins after MI (58.9%) is lower than in published studies in secondary prevention. The lack of lipid measurement and the delay since last measurement are non-prescription factors. The rates of prescription are even lower in case of PAD (44.6%) or IS history (33.3%). More than half of the patients (56.6%) are treated with beta-blockers and 40.1% with ACE inhibitors. These rates are similar to what has been published. Atherothrombotic disease represents a large part of the daily activity of private cardiologists and is not limited to coronary heart disease. Despite their proven efficacy, drugs for secondary prevention for MI, except antithrombotic drugs, are insufficiently prescribed. This under-prescription is even higher in patients with PAD or IS history and may be related to the lack of clinical trials in these specific territories.",

    "862": "Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibition can attenuate the effects of aging on renal function and structure; however, its effect on mitochondrial aging is unknown. To investigate whether an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril) or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (losartan) could mitigate age-associated changes in kidney mitochondria, male Wistar rats (14 mo old) received during 8 mo water containing either enalapril (10 mg/kg/day) (Enal), or losartan (30 mg/kg/day) (Los), or no additions (Old). Four-month-old untreated rats (Young) were also studied. In Old rats mitochondrial respiratory control, ADP/O, nitric oxide synthase activity, and uncoupling protein 2 levels were lower (46, 42, 27, and 76%, respectively), and Mn-SOD activity was higher (70%) than in Young, Enal, and Los rats. In Old rats mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide production was higher than in both Young (197%) and Enal or Los (40%) rats. In Old rats, kidney GSH/GSSG was lower than in both Young (80%) and Enal (57%) or Los (68%) rats. In Old rats electron microscopy showed effacement of microvilli in tubular epithelial cells, ill-defined mitochondrial cristae, lower mitochondrial numbers, and enhanced number of osmiophilic bodies relative to Young, Enal, or Los rats. In conclusion, enalapril and losartan can protect against both age-related mitochondrial dysfunction and ultrastructural alterations, underscoring the role of RAS in the aging process. An association with oxidative stress modulation is suggested.",

Proteinuria of >/=1 g/24 h was correlated with glomerulosclerosis, interstitial fibrosis and interstitial inflammation at time of biopsy (p < 0.005). The presence of segmental sclerosis (SS) correlated well with the amount of 24-h proteinuria (p < 0.001). After treatment with enalapril, the amount of proteinuria reduced in 64.3%. Therapeutic response to enalapril tended to be less effective in patients having SS (28.6 versus 71.4%), but this finding did not reach a statistical significance.",

Three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials have evaluated the efficacy of ER metoprolol succinate in the treatment of patients with chronic heart failure. The MERIT-HF (Metoprolol CR/XL Randomized Intervention Trial in Congestive Heart Failure) study, the largest of these trials and the largest randomized mortality trial with beta-blockers in heart failure to date, demonstrated that ER metoprolol succinate reduced the relative risk of all-cause mortality by 34% versus placebo. Furthermore, the relative risk of the combined endpoint of mortality plus all-cause hospitalizations was reduced by 19% and sudden death was reduced by 41%. The benefits of therapy were evident in various patient subgroups, including elderly patients and those with diabetes mellitus.

    "876": "The increased peripheral resistance in hypertension results from arteriolar vasoconstriction, increased media-to-lumen (M/L) ratio of small resistance arteries, and rarefaction (reduction in density) of microvessels. Numerous neurohumoral and hormonal factors are involved in causing structural and functional changes in the microcirculation in hypertension, including the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, remodelling of the extracellular matrix, increased growth of the smooth muscle cells of the media, and elevated collagen and fibronectin deposition. Although a wide variety of pharmacological agents can decrease blood pressure (BP) in hypertension, they vary in their ability to reverse structural and functional changes in the microcirculation. ACE inhibitors have consistently been shown to regress microvascular changes but findings with calcium antagonists have been variable and beta-adrenoceptor blockers appear to have no effect. In studies with ACE inhibitors, improvements in the M/L ratio and endothelial function of small resistance arteries have been recorded in both animal models of hypertension and human subcutaneous arteries obtained by biopsy of gluteal tissue from patients with essential hypertension. Recent studies with the very low-dose combination of perindopril and indapamide have indicated that these agents act synergistically to restore normal microvascularisation and reverse capillary rarefaction in the coronary circulation of hypertensive rats, and normalise coronary blood flow reserve in humans with hypertension. The additional benefit accruing from regression of structural and functional abnormalities in critical vascular beds such as coronary or renal circulations of patients with chronic hypertension may well become an important factor in selection of antihypertensive therapy, as complications such as ischaemic episodes and other target organ damage may be prevented and the BP-lowering effect of treatment may be extended such that it continues even after withdrawal. However, whether improvements in microcirculatory structure and function will be associated with improved morbidity and mortality outcomes in patients with chronic hypertension has yet to be firmly established.", 
    "877": "Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus have markedly increased risks of developing vascular diseases. These risks are reduced by lowering blood pressure in hypertensive individuals. However, the association between blood pressure and vascular risk appears continuous, with no clearly defined blood pressure level below which the risks fail to further decline. Intensive glucose lowering in these patients has also been shown to reduce microvascular disease, but effects on macrovascular disease remain uncertain.", 
    "878": "ADVANCE (Action in Diabetes and Vascular disease; preterAx and diamicroN-MR Controlled Evaluation) will examine the hypotheses that intensive blood pressure lowering (with an angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitor-diuretic combination) and glucose control in high-risk hypertensive or non-hypertensive individuals with type 2 diabetes reduce the incidence of vascular diseases. The study will also provide an opportunity to examine the effects of blood pressure lowering against a background of ACE inhibition among such patients.",

The REASON project was a randomised, double-blind study comparing the very low-dose combination perindopril 2mg/indapamide 0.625 mg (Per/Ind) versus atenolol 50mg for 12 months in 471 hypertensive patients. Both treatments produced similar reductions in brachial DBP, but Per/Ind produced greater reductions than atenolol in SBP (-23.1 +/- 15.6mm Hg vs -16.2 +/- 16.0mm Hg; p < 0.001) and PP (-9.9 +/- 12.4mm Hg vs -3.3 +/- 13.5mm Hg; p < 0.001). Patients with echocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy at baseline (n = 124) showed greater reduction of left ventricular mass index with Per/Ind (-11.3 +/- 15.4 g/m(2)) than atenolol (-5.3 +/- 15.1 g/m(2); p = 0.031). Relative to atenolol, Per/Ind selectively targets SBP and PP, which could be important in reducing cardiovascular risk.",

The details of the synthetic procedures of each requisite chiral binaphthyl subunit have been disclosed, and the structures of the assembled N-spiro chiral quaternary ammonium bromides 11a and 11f were unequivocally determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. The reactivity and selectivity of these chiral ammonium bromides as chiral phase-transfer catalysts have been evaluated in the asymmetric alkylation of the benzophenone Schiff base of glycine ester 7 under mild liquid-liquid phase-transfer conditions, and the optimization of the reaction variables (solvent, base, and temperature) has also been conducted. Further, the scope and limitations of this asymmetric alkylation have been thoroughly investigated with a variety of alkyl halides, in which the advantage of the unique N-spiro structure of 11 and dramatic effect of the steric as well as the electronic properties of the aromatic substituents on the 3,3'-position of one binaphthyl moiety have been particularly emphasized. Finally, the potential synthetic utility of the present method for the practical asymmetric synthesis of structurally diverse natural and unnatural alpha-amino acids has been demonstrated by its successful application to the facile asymmetric syntheses of (S)-N-acetylindoline-2-carboxylate, a key intermediate in the synthesis of the ACE inhibitor, and l-Dopa (l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine) ester and its analogue.", 
    "883": "It is generally accepted that cardiac surgery is frequently associated with the development of systemic inflammatory response. This phenomenon is very variable clinically, and can be detected by measuring plasma concentrations of certain inflammatory markers. Complement component, cytokines and adhesion molecules are examples of these markers. Systemic inflammation can be potentially damaging to major organs. Several anti-inflammatory strategies have been used in recent years, aiming to attenuate the development of systemic inflammatory response. This article summarizes recently published literature concerning the use of anti-inflammatory techniques and pharmacological agents in cardiac surgery. In particular, the anti-inflammatory effects of off-pump surgery, leukocyte filtration, corticosteroids, aprotinin, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, dpoexamine, H2 antagonists and ACE inhibitors are reviewed. The overall conclusion is that although certain strategies reduce plasma levels of inflammatory mediators, convincing evidence of significant clinical benefits is yet to come.", 
    "884": "Prevention or retardation of diabetic nephropathy (DN) includes anti-hypertensive treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARB) on the premises that these drugs have an added protective effect beyond their influence on BP. The present study used a strain of spontaneously hypertensive/NIH-corpulent rats [SHR/NDmc-cp (fat/fat)] as a model of type II DN to unravel the renoprotective effects of anti-hypertensive drugs. Olmesartan (1 or 5 mg/kg per d), an ARB, and hydralazine (5mg/kg per d), an anti-hypertensive drug without effect on the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), were given for 20 wk. BP, renal function, glucose and insulin levels, and proteinuria were monitored. Glomerular lesions and kidney pentosidine content were assessed at the end of the study. Olmesartan (1 and 5 mg) significantly reduced BP and kidney pentosidine content and improved histologic renal damage and proteinuria. The changes were dose-dependent. The effect of hydralazine (5 mg) was similar to that of olmesartan (1 mg) but reached statistical significance only for kidney pentosidine content. The similarity of both drugs' effects on kidney damage and proteinuria suggest that renoprotection does not hinge on manipulation of RAS in these rats. By contrast, the inhibition of renal pentosidine formation assessed both by immunohistochemistry and HPLC suggests a critical role of advanced glycation end product (AGE) formation together with hypertension in the genesis of diabetic nephropathy. This view is supported by the correlation found between renal pentosidine content and proteinuria. The unsuspected AGE-lowering effect of hydralazine was further confirmed in vitro and elucidated; it is due to both reactive carbonyl compounds trapping and modifications of the oxidative metabolism. It is concluded that AGE inhibition should be included in the therapeutic strategy of DN.", 
    "885": "Captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, is commonly prescribed to patients with Chagas heart disease (CHD). There are few human studies and no animal studies on the effects of captopril in CHD.

    "886": "A/J mice infected with Brazil strain of T cruzi developed acute myocarditis by day 21 after infection, consisting of severe focal inflammation, necrosis, fibrosis, and T cruzi pseudocysts. Administration of captopril (5 mg/L in the water) significantly reduced necrosis and fibrosis in infected mice. Increasing the captopril dose also led to a decrease in inflammation. Captopril did not affect overall mortality but did delay death while having no effect on parasitemia or cardiac parasite load. Treatment did not affect humoral immunity against T cruzi or cardiac myosin (autoimmunity) but did decrease delayed-type hypersensitivity responses against both antigens. Interestingly, increasing the dose of captopril induced mortality in infected mice in a dose-dependent manner. Mortality was apparently not due to T cruzi because neither parasitemia nor cardiac parasitosis was affected. The combination of captopril and infection may have impaired renal function because these mice had increased water consumption, decreased body mass, and increased serum BUN/creatinine ratio.",

The increases in CBF induced by BK in the perindopril and losartan groups were significantly greater than those in the control group. Net coronary tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) release was enhanced by BK in all groups, and the increase in the perindopril group was greater than that in the losartan and control groups. Bradykinin did not alter plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 levels in any of the groups.",

Seventy three type 1 diabetic patients with BP <140/90 and with persistent albuminuria (AER 20-200 microg/min) and normal renal function were randomly assigned to receive E (n=37) or placebo (n=36). A percutaneous renal biopsy was successfully performed in 69 patients and repeated in 59 patients after 5 years. The mean glomerular volume (MGV), mesangial volume (Vv mes) and glomerular basement membrane thickness (GBMT) were measured histomorphometrically. Before treatment, both groups had similar clinical characteristics, blood pressure, HbA(1c), albumin excretion rate (AER), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), serum creatinine and renal structural damage. Blood pressure was well controlled in both groups. In the patients treated with E, albuminuria decreased significantly (P<0.05) and only 8.1% (3/37) of subjects progressed to clinical albuminuria (AER >300 mg/24 h) compared with 30.5% (11/36) in the placebo group. The E treatment resulted in absolute risk reduction of 22.4 percentage points for the development of clinical albuminuria over a 5-year period (P<0.01). After 5 years of treatment, GBM thickness showed a consistent, though statistically insignificant, increase in the placebo group, whereas it remained stable in the E group. A significant increase in MGV and Vv mes was also observed in the placebo group on completion of the study. The present study indicates that long term therapy with E may decrease or delay the progression of structural glomerular damage in microalbuminuric diabetic subjects without marked hypertension (BP <140/90).", 
    "894": "Recent advances in the prevention and pharmacotherapy of cerebrovascular disease have provided more favorable clinical outcomes. For the treatment of an acute ischemic stroke, the early use of thrombolytic agents can reduce the degree of brain damage while improving functional outcomes. However, trials evaluating various classes of other neuroprotective agents have not shown benefit to date. For the prevention of second stroke, the use of antiplatelet drugs, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors with a diuretic have shown benefit in reducing new events. In patients with underlying heart disease or atrial fibrillation, warfarin appears to be the drug of choice in preventing stroke. Early treatment of hemorrhagic stroke with calcium channel blockers can improve the functional outcome. Innovative therapies are now available for the treatment of migraine and vascular dementia. Primary prevention of stroke remains the optimal therapeutic strategy and includes treatment of systemic hypertension and hypercholesterolemia.",
