Optimal pharmacological management of HF includes the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and \u03b2-blockers, which have been associated with decreased severity of central sleep apnea, which is likely secondary to improvements in cardiac performance. There is also evidence, however, indicating that other pharmacological treatments for HF might adversely affect sleep. This brief review introduces the topic of disturbed sleep in HF and examines the extent to which its standard pharmacological management impacts sleep quality.",

When JBP485 and lisinopril were administered orally simultaneously, the plasma concentrations of the two drugs were decreased significantly, but few changes were observed after simultaneous intravenous administration of the two drugs. The uptake of JBP485 and lisinopril in everted intestinal sacs and in HeLa cells transfected with human peptide cotransporter 1 (PEPT1), as well as absorption of JBP485 and lisinopril after jejunal perfusion were reduced after simultaneous drug administration, which suggested that the first target of drug interaction was PEPT1 in the intestine during the absorption process. The cumulative urinary excretions and renal clearance of the two drugs were decreased after intravenous co-administration, while uptakes of the two drugs in kidney slices and hOAT1/hOAT3-transfected HEK293 cells were decreased. These results indicated that the second target of drug-drug interaction was located in the kidney. These findings confirmed that the pharmacokinetic mechanism of interaction between JBP485 and lisinopril could be explained by their inhibition of the same transporters in the intestinal mucosa (PEPT1) and kidneys (OATs).",

    "16": "Hypertension (HT) and dementia are common disorders in the elderly. HT in the elderly is associated with increased occurrence rates of dementia including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD). In connection to this, some studies have suggested that HT in old age correlates with the pathogenesis of dementia. Since HT is potentially reversible, a number of randomized trials have examined whether antihypertensive treatment may help in preventing dementia occurrence. We review five studies, all using subjects 60 years or older, which investigated different antihypertensive pharmacological treatments. Data from two trials (Syst-Eur, PROGRESS) open the way toward the prevention of dementia (AD or VaD) by antihypertensive treatments. In the Syst-Eur study, with the dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, a reduction in both types of dementia was demonstrated (risk reduction 55%). The PROGRESS study showed that the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), with or without diuretics, resulted in decrease incidence of stroke-related dementia (risk reduction 19%), but dementia without stroke was not reduced. In contrast, the SHEP trial, treatment with a chlorthalidone-based antihypertensive regimen, did not significantly reduced the incidence of dementia. The SCOPE study (candesartan or hydrochlorothiazide versus placebo) and the HYVET-COG study (indapamide or perindopril versus placebo) found no significant difference between the active treatment and placebo group on the incidence of dementia. We found conflicting results regarding treatment benefits in dementia prevention. Recent clinical trials and studies on animal models suggest that blockades of RAS system could have reduced cognitive decline seen in Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. Future trials primarily designed to investigate the effects of antihypertensive agents on impaired cognition are needed.",

Emerging evidences suggest that, at least, part of the benefits observed with the use of AT1 receptor blockers could be attributed to the increased Ang (1-7) levels observed during administration of these agents. Identification of the novel components of the RAS, ACE2 and Ang (1-7) receptor mas, provided essential elements for considering the existence of a vasodilator arm of the RAS, represented by the ACE2-Ang (1-7)-mas axis. In this study, rat model of DCM was prepared by injection with porcine cardiac myosin. Twenty-eight days after immunization, candesartan cilexetil was administered intraperitoneally at 1 or 10mg/kg/day to rats for four weeks. Myocardial expression of Ang receptors and markers of calcium homeostasis, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and apoptosis were measured by Western blotting and histopathological staining techniques. Candesartan improved the functional markers in a dose-dependent manner and also upregulated Ang (1-7), ACE2 and mas1 in the myocardium of DCM rats. Various ER stress and apoptosis markers were attenuated and the number apoptotic cells were significantly lower in the candesartan treated rats compared with those of the vehicle group. These findings suggest that candesartan treatment prevented the progression of DCM by activation of the counter regulatory arm of the RAS and possibly through modulation of ER stress and subsequently, cardiac apoptosis.",

Moreover, the frequency of heart beat reduced and necessary increase of patient compliance for treatment took place. Taking the preparation only 31% of patients had unwilling effects but it didnt require the abolition of the antihypertension therapy till the end of observation.

Moreover perindopril in these patients diminished manifestations of insulin resistance, hyperleptinemia, and inflammation; it also exerted pronounced positive effect on anthropometric parameters and percent of fat deposits.

Patients of the first group received angiotensin II receptor antagonist (valsartan) as monotherapy. Valsacor was administered starting from the first 24 hours after destabilization of blood pressure, and the dose was titrated from 80 up to 160 mg/day. Traditional treatment of hypertension including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium antagonists, diuretics and beta-blockers was prescribed to controls. Valsacor treatment reduced the intensity of the symptoms of erectile dysfunction in hypertensive males (by 11,3 against 2,2% in the control group, p<0,05). In addition, this therapy led to a decrease in androgen deficiency symptoms (20,2 against 12,1%, respectively, p < 0,05). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure reduction was comparable in both groups. There was an increase in the number of \"dippers\" at valsacor treatment, while the number of other categories (\"over-dipper\", \"non-dipper\", \"night-peaker\") decreased (p<0,05). In the control group, circadian blood pressure profile was not changed. Thus, therapy with valsartan normalizes diurnal variations in blood pressure, reduces the symptoms of androgen deficiency and does not contribute to erectile dysfunction.",

The NO2(-) + NO3(-) concentration in erythrocytes decreases in hypertensive patients but is completely restored after therapy with lisinopril alone or in combination with simvastatin. Thus, lisinopril and lisinopril plus simvastatin display a pronounced and equal normalizing effect on arginase activity in human erythrocytes, which is elevated in hypertension, as well as on the endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity, which is decreased in hypertension.",

This study evaluated the redox status in both the cardiac tissue and at the cellular level (neutrophils). Two concentrations of captopril were utilized: (i) 5\u00a0mg\u00b7(kg body mass)(-1), which was considered a therapeutic dose; and (ii) 10\u00a0mg\u00b7(kg body mass)(-1). Body mass, plasma glucose, and serum insulin were evaluated. To investigate the redox status of the cardiac tissue, we analyzed lipid peroxidation, concentration of carbonylated protein, catalase activity, and the concentration of glutathione. For a more accurate assessment of the possible antioxidant effect of captopril, we also analyzed ROS in neutrophils (in vivo), and ROS production induced by bradykinin and the influence of the PKC pathway in this production (in vitro). Our data show that the hearts of diabetic animals have increased oxidative damage, exemplified by the increased concentration of carbonylated protein and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). However, animals treated with captopril at both concentrations showed lower concentrations of carbonylated protein compared with untreated diabetic animals. We found an increase of catalase activity in the heart of diabetic rats, which was reversed by captopril treatment at both of the dosages tested. Our data showed that captopril was able to reduce ROS production in the neutrophils of diabetic rats at a dose of 10\u00a0mg\u00a0captopril\u00b7(kg body mass)(-1). However, the antioxidant effect of captopril is independent of bradykinin. Diabetes induces oxidative stress, and these results suggest that captopril has an antioxidant effect and can modulate the production of ROS in circulating neutrophils.",

Since it is still unknown to which extent the biological activity of dairy proteins is altered by chemical reactions, this study focuses on the effect of photo-induced molecular changes on the angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity. Milk proteins were dissolved in phosphate buffer containing riboflavin and stored under light at 4 \u00b0C for one month during which the molecular changes and the ACE-inhibitory activity were analysed. An increase in the total protein carbonyls and the N-formylkynurenine content was observed, besides a decrease in the free thiol, tryptophan, tyrosine and histidine content. These changes were more severe in caseins compared with whey proteins and resulted moreover in the aggregation of caseins. Due to these photo-induced molecular changes, a significant loss of the ACE-inhibitory activity was observed for casein peptides. A peptide analysis moreover illustrated that the decreased activity was not attributed to a reduced digestibility but to losses of specific ACE-inhibitory peptides. The observed molecular changes, more specifically the degradation of specific amino acids and the casein aggregation, could be assigned as the cause of the altered peptide pattern and as such of the loss in ACE-inhibitory activity.", 
    "48": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) poses a significant healthcare and economic burden on societies and individuals. Angiotensin II is a key component of the renin-angiotensin system that plays a central role in atherosclerotic mechanisms that contribute to CVD. Renin-angiotensin system blockers are widely used to reduce cardiovascular (CV) risk owing to their potential both to lower blood pressure, a CV risk factor, and to attenuate the atherosclerotic disease process directly. Telmisartan has a number of pharmacological properties that distinguish it from other angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) - the longest plasma half-life, highest lipophilicity and strongest receptor binding affinity in class. The ONTARGET(\u00ae) trial showed that telmisartan is as effective as ramipril in reducing CV morbidity (including myocardial infarction and stroke) and mortality in a broad range of patients at increased CV risk. Evidence from other ARBs remains largely restricted to patients with heart failure, diabetic nephropathy or specific subsets of hypertensive patients. Telmisartan is, therefore, the only ARB with a broad indication for CV risk reduction in patients with atherothrombotic disease or diabetes with end-organ damage.", 
    "49": "The androgen nandrolone decanoate (ND) is known to cause cardiovascular abnormalities, such as attenuation of the Bezold-Jarisch Reflex (BJR), cardiac hypertrophy, and elevation of mean arterial pressure (MAP). Futhermore, a relationship between androgens and the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been reported. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of RAS on the BJR, cardiac and prostatic hypertrophy, and MAP evoked by ND. For this, male Wistar rats were treated with ND (10\u00a0mg\u00b7(kg body mass)(-1) for 8\u00a0weeks; DECA), or vehicle (control animals; CON), or enalapril (10\u00a0mg\u00b7(kg body mass)(-1), daily; CONE), or ND and enalapril (10\u00a0mg ND + 10\u00a0mg enalapril per kilogram of body mass; DECAE). After 8\u00a0weeks of treatment, the BJR was evaluated by bradycardia and hypotensive responses that were elicited by serotonin administration (2-32\u00a0\u00b5g\u00b7(kg body mass)(-1)). MAP was assessed; cardiac and prostate hypertrophy were determined by the ratio of the tissue mass:body mass, and by histological analysis of the heart. Animals from the DECA group showed prostatic and cardiac hypertrophy, elevation in mean arterial pressure, and an impairment of BJR. Co-treatment with enalapril inhibited these changes. The data from the present study suggest that RAS has an impact on BJR attenuation, cardiac and prostatic hypertrophy, and the elevation in MAP evoked by ND.", 
    "50": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays an important role not only in homeostasis but also in carcinogenesis. Recent epidemiological studies suggest that hypertensive patients with upregulated systemic RAS functions are at a significantly increased risk for the subsequent development of cancers with poor outcomes, and moreover that RAS inhibitors reduce tumor development, progression, and metastasis. Notably, Helicobacter pylori infection, one of the major predictors of gastric carcinogenesis, generally leads to RAS component overexpression, as exemplified by that of angiotensin I, angiotensin II, angiotensin I converting enzyme and angiotensin II receptor. Gastric mucosal RAS expression gradually increases with time after H. pylori infection with respect to the severity of inflammatory cell infiltration. Gastric carcinogenic potential is therefore considered to relate to RAS component expression levels and activities. This hypothesis is supported by findings that RAS genotypic variation can lead to high component expression levels (e.g. angiotensin I converting enzyme, chymase and angiotensinogen), and thereby increase the risk of development of gastric cancer. Thus, the RAS may be potently associated with the pathogenesis of H. pylori-related gastric carcinogenesis, and RAS inhibitors may provide tools for specifically preventing this disease.", 
    "51": "Randomized clinical trials have clearly shown that inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) will slow the rate of progression of diabetic nephropathy, but controversy remains about whether the observed beneficial effects result from more than control of blood pressure. Deletion of eNOS in a model of type II diabetes, db/db mice (eNOS(-/-) db/db), induces an accelerated nephropathy and provides an excellent model of human diabetic nephropathy. As is frequently seen in type II diabetes, blood pressure is moderately elevated in eNOS(-/-) db/db mice. To determine the role of elevated blood pressure per se vs. additional deleterious effects of the RAS in mediation of disease progression, 8-wk-old eNOS(-/-) db/db mice were randomly divided into three groups: vehicle, treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) captopril, or treatment with \"triple therapy\" (hydralazine, resperine, hydrocholorothiazide), and the animals were euthanized after treatment for 12 wk. Blood pressure was reduced to comparable levels with ACE inhibition or triple therapy. Although both treatment regimens decreased development of diabetic nephropathy, ACE inhibition led to more profound reductions in albuminuria, glomerulosclerosis, markers of tubulointerstitial injury, macrophage infiltration, and markers of inflammation. Therefore, this animal model suggests that while there is an important role for blood pressure control, RAS blockade provides additional benefits in slowing the progression of diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "52": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a monocarboxypeptidase that degrades angiotensin II with high efficiency leading to the formation of angiotensin-(1-7). ACE2 within the kidneys is largely localized in tubular epithelial cells and in glomerular epithelial cells. Decreased glomerular expression of this enzyme coupled with increased expression of ACE has been described in diabetic kidney disease, both in mice and humans with type 2 diabetes. Moreover, both ACE2 genetic ablation and pharmacological ACE2 inhibition have been shown to increase albuminuria and promote glomerular injury. Studies using recombinant ACE2 have shown the ability of ACE2 to rapidly metabolize Ang II in vivo and form the basis for future studies to examine the potential of ACE2 amplification in the therapy of diabetic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease.", 
    "53": "A large body of evidence indicates that patients with essential hypertension are characterized by endothelial dysfunction mediated by an impaired NO availability secondary to oxidative stress production. A dysfunctioning endothelium is an early marker of the development of atherosclerotic changes and can also contribute to cardiovascular events. Vascular reactivity tests represent the most widely used methods in the clinical assessment of endothelial function. In the last two decades, many studies have evaluated the endothelium in hypertensive patients, using different techniques. Several methodologies were developed to study microcirculation (resistance arteries and arterioles) and macrocirculation (conduit arteries), both in coronary and peripheral vascular districts. This review will describe the most relevant available techniques in the research on endothelial dysfunction in essential hypertension, their advantages and limitations, focusing on available data on endothelial dysfunction and on the effect of treatment. Endothelial dysfunction in the coronary and peripheral circulation of hypertensive patients are associated with hypertensive target organ damage and it is predictive of cardiovascular events. Several non-pharmacological approaches, including physical exercise and dietary interventions, can ameliorate endothelial function in hypertensive patients. Despite blood pressure reduction per se is not effective, some antihypertensive drugs can improve endothelial dysfunction, particularly calcium channel antagonist in the microcirculation, ACE-inhibitors and AT1-receptor antagonists mostly in conduit arteries. Some beneficial effects were also exerted by nebivolol and statins. Future studies are needed to confirm whether the improvement in endothelial dysfunction is associated to better cardiovascular prognosis in hypertension.", 
    "54": "Persistent oxidative stress in the vascular wall may lead to endothelial dysfunction, a pathological process widely implicated in the morbidities observed in a spectrum of cardiovascular disease. The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is regulated by various oxidase enzymes and mitochondrial electron transport mechanisms. Nitric oxide (NO) is a key mediator of endothelial function via its effect on endothelium dependent vascular relaxation. Therapeutic interventions aimed to increase NO bioavailability in the vasculature may improve the long term cardiovascular outcome for healthy individuals, high-risk subjects, and patients with advanced atherosclerosis. Current therapeutic strategies focus on enhancing synthesis or lowering oxidative inactivation of NO in human vasculature. Of the available therapeutic agents, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and statins have shown most promise at improving endothelial function and cardiovascular outcome after long term administration. Other therapeutic approaches may also be useful towards improving endothelial dysfunction. These strategies include targeting NO synthesis by modulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) coupling, such as folates and tetrahydrobiopterin. Evidence for the benefits of gene therapy to improve endothelial function is also emerging. However, the long term direct clinical benefit of these strategies aimed to improve endothelial function still remains unclear.", 
    "55": "Nitric oxide (NO) is a soluble gas continuously synthesized from the amino acid L-arginine in endothelial cells by the constitutive calcium-calmodulin-dependent enzyme nitric oxide synthase (NOS). Endothelial dysfunction has been identified as a major mechanism involved in all the stages of atherogenesis. Evaluation of endothelial function seems to have a predictive role in humans, and therapeutic interventions improving nitric oxide bioavailability in the vasculature, may improve the long-term outcome in healthy individuals, high-risk subjects or patients with advanced atherosclerosis. Several therapeutic strategies (including statins, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptors blockers, insulin sensitizers, antioxidant compounds) are now available, targeting both the synthesis and oxidative inactivation of NO in human vasculature, reversing in that way endothelial dysfunction which is enhanced by the release of nitric oxide from the endothelium.", 
    "56": "Recent guidelines including Japanese Society of Hypertension 2009 (JSH2009) recommend the lower target blood pressure such as < 130/80 mmHg in patients with diabetes mellitus, although the recent clinical trials such as ACCORD, INVEST or ROADMAP study raised questions about that the current target BP might be too low in some diabetic patients associated with coronary artery disease. In JSH2009, when BP is more than 130/80 mmHg, renin-angiotenisn blocker such as ACE inhibitor or ARB will be given as the first line hypotensive agent. If the target BP is not achieved, the dosage of ACE inhibitor or ARB is maximized or calcium channel antagonist or thiazide diuretic is added. In patients with metabolic syndrome, the target BP is < 140/90 mmHg. If their glucose tolerance is diabetic, the target BP is < 130/80 mmHg as mentioned above. The first line hypotensive agent is ACE inhibitor or ARB, since these agents improve insulin resistance.", 
    "57": "Strict antihypertensive therapy for thoracic aortic aneurysm is extremely important. Administration of beta-blocker or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) has been reported to prevent aneurysm enlargement in patients with Marfan's syndrome. While there is no significant association between hypertension and the risk of development of abdominal aortic aneurysm, a large-scale case controlled study showed a lower frequency of ruptured aneurysm in patients treated with ACE inhibitors. The beneficial effects of ACE inhibitor and/or ARB treatment should be confirmed by large-scale randomized controlled-trials. In patients with peripheral arterial disease, administration of beta-blockers has been considered to exacerbate lower limb ischemic symptoms; however they have recently been shown to be used safely in patients exhibiting intermittent claudication.",

Proteinuria and albuminuria indicate progressive kidney injury and are risk factors for end-stage renal disease(ESRD). Corrections of blood pressure and proteinuria or albuminuria reduce the risk of occurrence of CVD and progression to ESRD. Antihypertensive therapy in CKD includes the management of salt sensitivity and renin angiotensin system. Diuretics more effectively contribute to the balance of sodium and volume of water, when used with ACE inhibitor and ARB. Direct renin inhibitor has been available and shown potential to be a first choice for the treatment of hypertension in CKD.",

In cerebral infarction that is not an indication for thrombolytic therapy, antihypertensive therapy is indicated when systolic pressure is > 220 mmHg or diastolic pressure is > 120 mmHg. In cerebral hemorrhage, a systolic blood pressure > 180 mmHg or a mean blood pressure > 130 mmHg is an indication for antihypertensive therapy. In the chronic phase of stroke, the eventual target of blood pressure control should be < 140/90 mmHg. Antihypertensive drugs recommened in the chronic phase are Ca channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), diuretics, etc. In patients with diabetes mellitus or atrial fibrillation, ACE inhibitors and ARBs are recommended.",

Followings are the main points of JSH2009 guidelines : (1) CV risk stratification and strategy of hypertension management are revised in consideration with of high-normal BP, metabolic syndrome(risk stratum-2), and CKD(risk stratum-3). (2) Tight control of BP levels < 130/85 mmHg is recommended in general hypertensive patients. More tight control is recommended in patients with DM, CKD, and post MI : BP < 130/80 mmHg. (3) Final target of BP in the elderly is < 140/90 mmHg. However BP should be reduced carefully by setting an intermediate target of < 150/90 mmHg in patients with 75 yrs or over. (4) BP control over 24 hours and usefulness of home BP measurement are stressed. Masked hypertension, morning surge, night-time hypertension, and sleep apnea syndrome are particularly important issues. (5) CCB, ARB, ACE inhibitor, diuretic, and beta-blocker are recommended as initial antihypertensive drugs, combination therapy such as ARB+diuretics or CCB are often necessary to achieve BP target. (6) Tight BP control and specific consideration for choice of drugs such as RA inhibitors are required in hypertension associated with organ damage and hypertension complicated with diabetes, CKD and metabolic syndrome.",

    "69": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) exists in the brain and it may be involved in pathogenesis of neurological and psychiatric disorders including seizures. The aim of the present research was to evaluate the effects of some angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi; captopril, enalapril, fosinopril and zofenopril), commonly used as antihypertensive agents, in the DBA/2 mice animal model of generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Furthermore, the co-administration of these compounds with some antiepileptic drugs (AEDs; carbamazepine, diazepam, felbamate, gabapentin, lamotrigine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, topiramate and valproate) was studied in order to identify possible positive interactions in the same model. All ACEi were able to decrease the severity of audiogenic seizures with the exception of enalapril up to the dose of 100mg/kg, the rank order of activity was as follows: fosinopril>zofenopril>captopril. The co-administration of ineffective doses of all ACE inhibitors with AEDs, generally increased the potency of the latter. Fosinopril was the most active in potentiating the activity of AEDs and the combination of ACEi with lamotrigine and valproate was the most favorable, whereas, the co-administrations with diazepam and phenobarbital seemed to be neutral. The increase in potency was generally associated with an enhancement of motor impairment, however, the therapeutic index of combined treatment of AEDs with ACEi was predominantly more favorable than control. ACEi administration did not influence plasma and brain concentrations of the AEDs studied excluding pharmacokinetic interactions and concluding that it is of pharmacodynamic nature. In conclusion, fosinopril, zofenopril, enalapril and captopril showed an additive anticonvulsant effect when co-administered with some AEDs, most notably carbamazepine, felbamate, lamotrigine, topiramate and valproate, implicating a possible therapeutic relevance of such drug combinations.", 
    "70": "Hypertension is considered a low-grade inflammatory condition, and understanding the role of transcription factors in guiding this response is pertinent. A prominent transcription factor that governs inflammatory responses and has become a focal point in hypertensive research is nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF\u03baB). Within the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), a known brain cardioregulatory center, NF\u03baB becomes potentially even more important in ultimately coordinating the systemic hypertensive response. To definitively demonstrate the role of NF\u03baB in the neurogenic hypertensive response, we hypothesized that PVN NF\u03baB blockade would attenuate angiotensin II-induced hypertension. Twelve-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted with radiotelemetry probes for blood pressure measurement and allowed a 7-day recovery. After baseline blood pressure recordings, rats were administered either continuous NF\u03baB decoy oligodeoxynucleotide infusion or microinjection of a serine mutated adenoviral inhibitory-\u03baB vector, or their respective controls, bilaterally into the PVN to inhibit NF\u03baB at two levels of its activation pathway. Simultaneously, rats were implanted subcutaneously with an angiotensin II or saline-filled 14-day osmotic minipump. After the 2-week treatments, rats were euthanized and brain tissues collected for PVN analysis. Bilaterally inhibited NF\u03baB rats had a decrease in blood pressure, NF\u03baB p65 subunit activity, proinflammatory cytokines, and reactive oxygen species, including the angiotensin II type 1 receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme, tumor necrosis factor, and superoxide in angiotensin II-treated rats. Moreover, after NF\u03baB blockade, key protective antihypertensive renin-angiotensin system components were upregulated. This demonstrates the important role that transcription factor NF\u03baB plays within the PVN in modulating and perpetuating the hypertensive response via renin-angiotensin system modulation.",

Compared with values measured at conception, serum creatinine (0.8 - 1.0 mg/dl, p < 0.01) and proteinuria (0.7 - 1.5 g/g, p < 0.01) increased significantly postnatally, while eGFR decreased (91.2 - 77.8 ml/min, p < 0.01). In a multiple linear regression analysis, proteinuria at conception were independently associated with a faster decline in postnatal maternal eGFR (\u03b2 = 4.50, p < 0.05). In addition, a less decline in maternal eGFR was observed in patients with a reduction in proteinuria (> 30%) prior to pregnancy, compared with those with a less reduction (\u2264 30%).

Therefore, early recognition and optimal use of available interventions are essential, and research into newer therapeutic targets is needed.

These treatments lower blood pressure and prevent the appearance of markers of subclinical disease (such as microalbuminuria), reduce cardiovascular and renal events in patients with subclinical lesions, and prolong survival in patients with clinical disease or organ dysfunction. Despite this unquestionable benefit, the residual risk in patients receiving these treatments often continues to be high and, consequently, strategies to reduce such risk are required. The present article reviews options that may help to reduce cardiovascular disease in such patients.

    "81": "Milk proteins contain numerous potential bioactive peptides, which may be released by digestive proteases or by the proteolytic system of lactic acid bacteria during food processing. The capacity of Streptococcus thermophilus to generate peptides, especially bioactive peptides, from bovine caseins was investigated. Strains expressing various levels of the cell envelope proteinase, PrtS, were incubated with \u03b1(s1)-, \u03b1(s2)-, or \u03b2-casein. Analysis of the supernatants by LC-ESI-MS/MS showed that the \u03b2-casein was preferentially hydrolyzed, followed by \u03b1(s2)-casein and then \u03b1(s1)-casein. Numbers and types of peptides released were strain-dependent. Hydrolysis appeared to be linked with the accessibility of different casein regions by protease. Analysis of bonds hydrolyzed in the region 1-23 of \u03b1(s1)-casein suggests that PrtS is at least in part responsible for the peptide production. Finally, among the generated peptides, 13 peptides from \u03b2-casein, 5 from \u03b1(s2)-casein, and 2 from \u03b1(s1)-casein have been reported as bioactive, 15 of them being angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.",

Food-derived ACE-inhibitory peptides are particularly attractive because of reduced side effects. Previously, we reported ACE-inhibitory activity of grass carp protein hydrolysates. In this work, we report steps for purifying the ACE-inhibitory peptide from the hydrolysate and its biochemical properties. Following steps of ultrafiltration, macroporous adsorption resin, and two steps of reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (RE-HPLC), a single Val-Ala-Pro (VAP) tripeptide was identified. The tripeptide with excellent ACE-inhibitory activity (IC(50) value of 0.00534 mg/mL) was a competitive ACE inhibitor and stable against both ACE and gastrointestinal enzymes of pepsin and chymotrypsin.

That trial compared the effects of candesartan-based therapy with those of non-angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB)-based standard therapy on major adverse cardiovascular events. Hypertensive patients with coronary artery disease were randomly assigned to receive either candesartan-based (n = 1,024) or non-ARB-based pharmacotherapy, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (n = 1,025). During a median follow-up of 4.2 years, 1,606 adverse events (798 in the candesartan group and 808 in the non-ARB standard group) were reported. Among them, new cancer occurred in 5.37% of subjects in the candesartan group and 5.66% of subjects in the standard therapy group (hazard ratio 0.95, 95% confidence interval 0.65 to 1.38). Cancer deaths occurred in 1.66% in the candesartan group and 2.44% in the standard therapy group, respectively (hazard ratio 0.74, 95% confidence interval 0.39 to 1.39). Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival without new cancer and cancer deaths demonstrated that candesartan-based therapy does not accelerate the occurrence of new cancer (log-rank, p = 0.84) or cancer death (p = 0.39) compared to standard therapy. Advanced age and male gender were independently and significantly correlated with the subsequent incidence of cancer. In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest that candesartan-based therapy is not associated with either carcinogenesis or cancer death compared to non-ARB standard therapy.",

    "99": "The multidrug-resistance-associated proteins 1 and 2 (MRP1/MRP2) are transporters responsible for the efflux of drugs and endogenous compounds. Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells transfected with the human MRP1 or MRP2 genes were used to assess whether several widely used pharmaceuticals are potential substrates by examining their differential toxicity, accumulation and efflux. Loratadine, an antihistamine, was 1.4-fold less toxic to MRP1 cells and its retention was 1.3-fold lower than that from MDCK control cells. Fosinopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, was 2.4-fold less toxic and its retention was 4.5-fold lower in MRP2-transfected cells compared with control cells. To determine whether fosinopril contributed to a drug-drug interaction, fosinopril efflux was examined in vitro in combination with other known or suspected MRP2 substrates over a period of 20\u2009min. When fosinopril was coincubated with desloratadine, loratadine or methotrexate, its retention was increased by 2-, 4.7- and 2-fold, respectively, which likely indicates that a drug-drug interaction is occurring. In vivo studies were conducted, in which FVB wild-type and FVB/Mrp2(-/-) mice were dosed with fosinopril and the known MRP2 substrate methotrexate, and tissues collected after 1\u2009h. In mice lacking Mrp2, drug levels were reduced in the intestine by 1.5-fold, but increased in the liver, serum and kidneys, by 2.1-, 2.9- and 3-fold, respectively. These data suggest that, in the absence of Mrp2, fosinopril alters the retention of a second drug. These findings will help increase our understanding of the role that MRP2 plays in altering the retention and disposition of coadministered pharmaceuticals.",

The plasma level of transforming growth factor-\u03b2 was significantly attenuated almost in parallel with the suppression of serum fibrosis markers. Furthermore, the combined treatment with BCAA and ACE-I improved the serum albumin level and IR, which was evaluated using the homeostasis model assessment method for IR.

Therefore, we designed a randomized controlled trial using amlodipine as the base drug of a multi-drug regimen, the Optimal Combination of Effective ANtihypertensives (OCEAN) Study, to determine the drug combination that is most efficacious in the prevention of cardiovascular events, such as stroke. The OCEAN Study is a collaborative study between Japan and China, enrolling 20\u2009000 patients and following them for 3 to 4 years. A pilot study was conducted before the full-scale study to confirm the feasibility of the protocol and that the study groups and infrastructures could function properly. A total of 279 Japanese patients were enrolled from 57 participating medical institutions between June and December 2004. Two hundred and sixty-six patients (mean age: 65.9 years) were treated with amlodipine alone. One hundred and fifty-four of these patients (57.9%) did not reach the treatment targets (<140/90\u2009mm\u2009Hg for the elderly and patients with cerebrovascular disease, <130/80\u2009mm\u2009Hg for those with diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease or prior myocardial infarction) and a second agent was added. They were randomly allocated into three different treatment groups using a diuretic, a \u03b2-blocker or an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin II receptor antagonist. The pilot study showed that the protocol was appropriate, and the inclusion of patients with slightly higher blood pressures was necessary to increase the randomization rate. It also confirmed that we organized properly functioning study groups and infrastructures.",

A guideline committee of nearly 100 members appointed by the Chinese Hypertension League (CHL) and the National Centre for Cardiovascular Disease (NCCD), in collaboration with the Chinese societies of cardiology, nephrology, neurology, gynecology and endocrinology, convened on several occasions and discussed the guidelines, drafted by a core writing group. The prevalence of hypertension has been increasing in China for decades, and reached 18.8% in the year 2002. The rates of awareness, treatment and control for hypertension patients remain low compared to high income countries, in spite of substantial improvements since 1991. In some communities, the control rate of hypertension increased up to 60%. The mortality rate of stroke, which is the major complication of hypertension in the Chinese population, gradually decreased during the period, more so in urban areas than in rural areas for the middle-aged and elderly populations; in the younger age groups, however, it increased. As hypertension is a \"cardiovascular syndrome\", the management strategy should be based on the overall risk of cardiovascular disease estimated with all related risk factors, target organ damage and co-morbidity of patients. The target blood pressure is set at SBP/DBP < 140/90 mm Hg (1 mm Hg = 0. 133 kPa) in uncomplicated hypertension; < 150/90 mm Hg for the elderly (> or = 65 years) or, if tolerable, < 140/90 mm Hg; and < 130/80 mm Hg for those with diabetes, coronary heart disease or renal disease. For these high risk patients, the management should be individualised. In general, lifestyle modification, such as sodium restriction, smoking cessation, moderation of body weight and alcohol consumption, and increasing dietary potassium intake and physical activity, should be implemented for prevention and control of hypertension. Five classes of antihypertensive drugs, including calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin type II receptor blockers, diuretics and beta-blockers, as well as single pill combinations of these agents, can be used for initial and maintenance of antihypertensive treatment. Several populations require special attention in the prevention and control of hypertension, such as children and adolescents, the elderly, pregnant women, and patients with various cardiovascular complications. Since health-care policies and resources vary substantially from one place to another, two levels of recommendations of management are proposed: a sophisticated and a basic, allowing doctors-in-charge to manage their patients in a more feasible way.",

In this study, a novel [Met5]enkephalin amide (MEA) analogue [Met5]enkephalin (ME)-semicarbazide synthesized by another laboratory in our group was assessed for its antinociceptive effects compared with ME-ethylamide, MEA and ME, using tail flick test. To protect the administered drugs from biodegradation, rats were pretreated with peptidase inhibitors including amastatin, phosphoramidon and captopril. Then captopril (dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase-I inhibitor) was deleted from the peptidase inhibitors' combination for evaluating in vivo resistance of the synthetic drugs to dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase-I. According to the results, ME-semicarbazide and MEA were resistant enough to dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase-I to exert their strong antinociception following intrathecal administration even in the absence of captopril, whereas the antinociceptive effects produced by ME-ethylamide (10\u2009nmol) were abolished in rats not pretreated with captopril, indicating that significant amounts of the ME-ethylamide were degraded by dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase-I.

Observations on day 1 constituted the acute study (single dose administration) and observations on day 7, constituted the chronic study (repeated dose administration). Both acute and chronic administration of enalapril/losartan produced an increase in the duration of haloperidol induced catalepsy at the highest dose (20\u2009mg/kg). Enalapril produced a more pronounced increase in the duration of catalepsy as compared to losartan on both acute and chronic administration.

    "218": "Coronary disease is a major cause of death and disability. From 1975 to 2000, coronary mortality was reduced by half. Better treatments and reduction of risk factors are the main causes. This phenomenon is observed in most developed countries, but mortality from coronary heart disease continues to increase in developing countries. In-hospital mortality of ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is in the range of 7 to 10% in registries. In infarction without ST segment elevation (NSTEMI), in-hospital mortality is around 5%. More recent studies found a similar in-hospital mortality for STEMI and NSTEMI. Because of patient selection and monitoring, mortality in clinical trials is much lower. After adjustment for the extent of coronary disease, age, risk factors, history of myocardial infarction, the excess mortality observed in women is fading. Many clinical, biological and laboratory parameters are associated with mortality in myocardial infarction. They refer to the immediate risk of death (ventricular rhythm disturbances, shock\u2026), the extent of infarction (number of leads with ST elevation on the ECG, release of biomarkers, ejection fraction\u2026), the presence of heart failure, the failure of reperfusion and the patient's baseline risk (age, renal function\u2026). Risk scores, and more specifically the GRACE risk score, synthesize these different markers to predict the risk of death in a given patient. However, their use for the treatment of myocardial only concerns NSTEMI. Only a limited number of mechanical or pharmacological interventions reduces mortality of heart attack. The main benefits are observed with reperfusion by thrombolysis or primary angioplasty in STEMI, aspirin, heparin, beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Some medications such as bivalirudin and fondaparinux reduce mortality by decreasing the incidence of hemorrhagic complications. The guidelines classify interventions according to their benefit and especially their ability to reduce mortality. Organized care systems that improve implementation of guidelines also reduce mortality. Finally, some new therapeutic approaches such as post-conditioning and new therapeutic classes offer encouraging prospects for further reducing the mortality of myocardial infarction.",

HF deaths in DMD occur in young patients and increase, along with respiratory failure, in older patients. Managing HF, therefore, is the most important component of DMD treatment. Management of HF is necessary in DMD patients of all ages because myocardial damage progresses regardless of age and disability. Electrocardiography, echocardiography, myocardial single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and natriuretic peptides are used for the diagnosis of myocardial damage and chronic HF. Tissue Doppler echocardiography is in particularly useful for early detection of minute myocardial damage and dysfunction in DMD. The first-line drugs for chronic HF are angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and the prognosis of DMD patients has been improved using these drugs and beta-blockers. Diuretics are added in the presence of pulmonary congestion. Digoxin is most effective at a blood level of 0.5-0.8 ng/mL because of its pharmacokinetics in DMD. Surgical treatment may be necessary in cases of intractable HF. Cardiac resynchronization therapy (biventricular pacing), a treatment with an artificial pacemaker, is indicated for cases that meet specific criteria, including HF with ventricular dyssynchrony.

APOL1 nephropathy risk variants persist because of protection afforded from the parasite that causes African sleeping sickness. This breakthrough will lead to novel treatments for hypertensive African Americans with low-level proteinuria, for whom effective therapies are lacking. Furthermore, APOL1 nephropathy risk variants contribute to racially variable allograft survival rates after kidney transplantation and assist in detecting nondiabetic forms of nephropathy in African Americans with diabetes.

In spite of the therapeutic benefits of Trz, cardiotoxic side effects are still an issue. This effect is potentiated particularly when Trz is administered following doxorubicin (DOX) treatment. Among the various mechanisms that may account for DOX and Trz-induced cardiotoxicity, the role of oxidative stress has gained significant support. The present review discusses the evidence supporting the hypothesis that oxidative stress comes from multiple sources through an increase in the production of reactive oxygen species and/or a decrease in antioxidant defense systems. The adjuvant use of Trz can potentiate cardiomyocyte damage through a 'dual-hit' mechanism, which includes inhibition of the neuregulin-1 survival signalling pathway and angiotensin II-induced activation of NADPH oxidase, with the ability to further increase reactive oxygen species production. Preventive therapies for DOX- and Trz-induced cardiac dysfunction have eluded investigators, but may include the prophylactic use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers and use of antioxidants. Thus, a better understanding of the mechanisms leading to this characteristic drug-induced cardiomyopathy, as well as potential cardioprotective strategies is required.",

Results from a large meta-analysis suggested that ARB use is associated with a modest increase in risk of new cancer incidence. The publication of that meta-analysis led to subsequent large population analyses. A comprehensive literature review was conducted to identify studies evaluating the relationships among angiotensin II, ARBs, cancer, and malignancy. Preclinical studies evaluating the effects of angiotensin II and ARBs on proliferation and angiogenesis were selected to review how the renin-angiotensin system is involved in cellular proliferation and growth.

However, not all the benefit of antihypertensive treatment is due to BP reduction per se, as the effect of reducing the risk of stroke differs among classes of antihypertensive agents. Extensive evidences support that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCB) and thiazide diuretics each reduced risk of stroke compared with placebo or no treatment. Therefore, when combination therapy is required, a combination of these antihypertensive classes represents a logical approach. Despite the efficacy of antihypertensive therapy a large proportion of the population, still has undiagnosed or inadequately treated HT, and remain at high risk of stroke. In primary stroke prevention current guidelines recommend a systolic/diastolic BP goal of <140/<90 mmHg in the general population and <130/80 mmHg in diabetics and in subjects with high cardiovascular risk and renal disease. The recent release in the market of the fixed-dose combination (FDC) of ACEI or ARB and CCB should provide a better control of BP.

Moreover, this obesity-associated insulin resistance is reduced by treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor (type 1) blockers. However, it is currently unknown whether specific inhibition of renin itself, the rate-limiting step in RAS functionality, improves insulin action in obesity-associated insulin resistance. Therefore, the present study assessed the effect of chronic, selective renin inhibition using aliskiren on glucose tolerance, whole body insulin sensitivity, and insulin action on the glucose transport system in skeletal muscle of obese Zucker rats. Obese Zucker rats were treated for 21 days with either vehicle or aliskiren (50 mg/kg body wt ip). Renin inhibition was associated with a significant lowering (10%, P < 0.05) of resting systolic blood pressure and induced reductions in fasting plasma glucose (11%) and free fatty acids (46%) and homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (13%). Glucose tolerance (glucose area under the curve) and whole body insulin sensitivity (inverse of the glucose-insulin index) during an oral glucose tolerance test were improved by 15% and 16%, respectively, following chronic renin inhibition. Moreover, insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity in isolated soleus muscle of renin inhibitor-treated animals was increased by 36% and was associated with a 2.2-fold greater Akt Ser(473) phosphorylation. These data provide evidence that chronic selective inhibition of renin activity leads to improvements in glucose tolerance and whole body insulin sensitivity in the insulin-resistant obese Zucker rat. Importantly, chronic renin inhibition is associated with upregulation of insulin action on skeletal muscle glucose transport, and it may involve improved Akt signaling. These data support the strategy of targeting the RAS to improve both blood pressure regulation and insulin action in conditions of insulin resistance.",

    "265": "To determine whether the extent of myocardial fibrosis by late-gadolinium enhancement cardiovascular magnetic resonance (LGE-CMR), and echocardiographic ventricular dyssynchrony are independently associated with response to medical therapy in patients with newly diagnosed idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Myocardial fibrosis and ventricular dyssynchrony are frequent findings in DCM. Previous studies focused on patients with established cardiomyopathy; however, the degree of myocardial fibrosis and ventricular dyssynchrony at presentation and their role in perpetuating left ventricular (LV) dysfunction in DCM remains unclear. Those studies of individuals with long-standing DCM did not characterize patients early in the disease course, and may not have included those with significant improvement in LV function. Thus factors contributing to LV recovery are uncertain.", 
    "266": "Consecutive patients with a new diagnosis of DCM [LV ejection fraction (EF) \u226445%] made within the preceding 2 weeks were recruited. Patients underwent LGE-CMR, echocardiography, 6-minute walk testing, cardiopulmonary exercise testing, and blood sampling for measurement of serum amino-terminal pro-brain natiuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP) concentration at baseline. Baseline patient characteristics were compared with a cohort of healthy volunteers. Myocardial fibrosis by LGE-CMR was quantified, identified by experienced observers blinded to patient outcome. Left ventricular systolic function was reassessed after 5 months of optimal medical therapy. Sixty-eight patients with DCM and 19 healthy volunteers were studied. DCM patients were studied a median 12.5 days following diagnosis. Compared with healthy controls, DCM patients exhibited greater inter- and intra-ventricular dyssynchrony. Twenty-four per cent of DCM patients exhibited LGE at diagnosis. Among DCM patients with LGE, the mean fibrosis mass was 2.2 \u00b1 1.3 g. On multivariate analysis, strain dyssynchrony index, and fibrosis mass were independently associated with change in the LVEF over time (P\u2264 0.001). Late-gadolinium enhancement cardiovascular magnetic resonance conferred additive value for modelling change in the LVEF beyond clinical and echocardiographic dyssynchrony parameters.", 
    "267": "The extent of myocardial fibrosis is independently associated with lack of response to medical therapy in new-presentation DCM, and LGE-CMR may thus be an important risk-stratifying investigation in these patients. Accurate risk stratification may permit more targeted pharmacological and device therapies for patients with newly diagnosed DCM.",

We evaluated the effects of aliskiren on the fibrinolytic system in patients with coronary artery disease who were receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs). We studied 17 patients with coronary artery disease whose systolic blood pressure was more than 130 mmHg despite treatment with ACEIs or ARBs. Aliskiren (150 mg) was added to ACEIs or ARBs, and was continued for 6 weeks. Aliskiren significantly decreased systolic blood pressure (140 \u00b1 6-128 \u00b1 8 mmHg, P < 0.001) and plasma renin activity (1.8 \u00b1 2.3-0.6 \u00b1 0.9 ng/ml/h, P < 0.01) after 6 weeks. However, it did not affect plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (28.8 \u00b1 14.5-30.6 \u00b1 13.6 ng/ml, P = 0.84), fibrinogen (305 \u00b1 72 vs 301 \u00b1 71 mg/dl, P = 0.33), or D-dimer (0.49 \u00b1 0.24-0.51 \u00b1 0.28 \u03bcg/ml, P = 0.70) levels.

    "273": "Stable angina is a form of coronary artery disease. Its potential to progress requires the most appropriate treatment in order to reduce the incapacitating effect of an acute angina attack and to avoid long-term cardiovascular events. With or without revascularization, pharmacological treatment is an essential component of this treatment strategy, which also involves lifestyle and diet. Statins and aspirin have been shown to be effective in preventing different aspects of coronary artery disease overall. The efficacy of other classes of treatment has been demonstrated in contexts such as stable angina (including postmyocardial infarction) and heart failure (under specific conditions of dosing) for beta-blockers and in contexts such as heart failure, postinfarction and following revascularization for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Along with the oldest classes of treatment, such as nitrates (and related derivatives), beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers, new classes of treatments with entirely (trimetazidine, ivabradine) or partly (nicorandil) different mechanisms of action have now been added. The latest antianginal to obtain marketing authorization, ranolazine, is not yet available in France. The different levels of evidence of the efficacy of these pharmacological products vary greatly and overall are higher for those developed most recently. None is devoid of side effects, which must be taken into account in these patients, many of whom are elderly and polymedicated.", 
    "274": "Peritoneal membrane changes over time in long-term peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients lead to dialysis failure and increased morbidity as well as mortality. Bio-incompatable PD solution, peritonitis, and uremia are hypothesized in causing membrane damage. Fibrous organization and angiogenesis of peritoneum are crucial morphological alterations which can diminish the efficacy of exchange and cause ultrafiltration failure. Pathophysiologic mechanisms of membrane damage have been extensively studied to innovate therapeutic strategies. One of the potential mechanisms is a presence of local renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) by which injured peritoneal mesothelial cell-derived angiotensin-II (AII) causes activations in TGF-beta, VEGF expression, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) which contributes to extracellular matrix accumulation and neoangiogenesis in submesothelial tissues. Clinical evidence of RAAS blockade on human peritoneal membrane remains under investigation and is still inconclusive but relevant data seem to demonstrate its benefit on membrane preservation. Longitudinal effect of RAAS blockade on membrane structural, functional, and clinical relationships and strategies to use angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), aldosterone antagonist, and direct renin inhibitor are an interesting field to be explored.",

Treatment recommendations for resistant hypertension include maximizing diuretic therapy by using chlorthalidone and/or adding an aldosterone antagonist. Additional recommendations include combining antihypertensive agents from different drug classes. This retrospective cohort study describes antihypertensive use in patients with resistant hypertension defined as the concurrent use of \u22654 antihypertensive agents. Claims data from the Medstat MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounter database were used to identify patients with resistant hypertension based on International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnosis codes and National Drug Codes between May 1, 2008 and June 30, 2009. Of the 5 442 410 patients with hypertension in the database, 140 126 met study criteria. The most frequently prescribed antihypertensive classes were angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin receptor blockers (96.2%), diuretics (93.2%), calcium channel blockers (83.6%), and \u03b2-blockers (80.0%). Only 3.0% and 5.9% of patients were on chlorthalidone or an aldosterone antagonist, respectively. A total of 15.6% of patients were treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor plus angiotensin receptor blocker. Our findings demonstrate that frequently prescribed antihypertensive agents for the treatment of resistant hypertension included guideline-recommended first-line agents. However, evidence-based and recommended agents, such as chlorthalidone and aldosterone antagonists, were underused. Moreover, minimally efficacious combinations, such as an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor with an angiotensin receptor blocker, were prescribed at higher rates than evidence-based and recommended agents.",

Several factors are associated with the onset and progression of CKD, such as obesity, hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Beyond these factors, there is evidence of a pathophysiological role for inflammation in CKD. Several cytokines and chemokines have been detected in the plasma and urine of patients at early stages of CKD, and have also been related to CKD complications. The expression of these mediators and renal injury may be influenced by drugs such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, statins and antagonists of cytokine receptors. Modulation of the immune-inflammatory response can become a target for CKD treatment. The aim of this study was to review the scientific evidence on the role of inflammation in CKD, especially the effects of cytokines and chemokines.", 
    "277": "Various drug transporters are selectively expressed in single or multiple tissues, such as the intestine, liver and kidney, where these transporters play various roles in drug absorption, distribution and excretion. Genetic polymorphisms in drug transporters as well as drug-metabolizing enzymes are associated with interindividual differences in drug disposition, efficacy and toxicity. Organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1, gene SLCO1B1) is expressed on the basolateral membrane of hepatocytes and can facilitate hepatic uptake of certain clinically relevant drugs such as statins except for fluvastatin, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, antidiabetic drug (repaglinide) and anticancer drugs (SN-38 and methotrexate). Some single nucleotide polymorphisms or haplotypes of the SLCO1B1 gene have been identified and demonstrated to have functional significance for transporter activity. For examples, the SLCO1B1*15 haplotype (or 521T>C genotype) results in decreased uptake activity of SN-38 from systemic circulation, leading to increased plasma concentration of SN-38 and an enhanced risk of neutropenia. This review focuses on the impact of genetic polymorphisms of the SLCO1B1 gene on transport activity, and implications for the clinical efficacy and toxicity of clinically useful drugs.",

We pooled data from 13 trials of 80 594 patients; outcomes included 9043 all-cause deaths, 5674 cardiovascular deaths, 3106 myocardial infarctions, and 4452 strokes. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or ARB reduced the composite primary outcome of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke by 11% (95% confidence interval 7-15%), with no variation in efficacy across baseline systolic blood pressure strata. In patients with baseline systolic pressure <130 mmHg, ACE-I or ARB reduced the composite primary outcome by 16% (10-23%) and all-cause mortality by 11% (4-18%)-this benefit was consistent across all subgroups examined including those without systolic heart failure (OR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.75-0.88) and those without diabetes (OR: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.70-0.89).",

An increasing body of evidence suggests that myocardial involvement is due, at least in part, to abnormal vasospasm, with or without associated structural abnormalities, of the small coronary arteries or arterioles. Impaired myocardial perfusion, as well as left and right ventricular dysfunction, have recently been confirmed in this setting, using more sensitive techniques such as tissue Doppler echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging.

From January 2000 to December 2007, 131 consecutive patients aged 75 years or older received adjuvant radiotherapy after breast conserving surgery. Eighty-two patients received radiotherapy in combination with 5 years of hormone therapy with tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitor. Thirty out of 131 received chemotherapy. Variables considered were age, stage, co-morbidity, performance status, radiation dose (boost), hormone therapy and chemotherapy. The mean age was 78.3 years (range 75-88 years). A total of 19.1% of the patients had no co-morbidity, 57.38% mild, 19.8% moderate, and 3.8% had severe co-morbidities. All patients but one completed the planned radiation schedule. At a median follow-up of 56 months, the 5-year overall survival rate was 78.8%. There was a better survival for patients with no or mild co-morbidities (p<0.0001). The disease-free survival at 5 years was 89.6%. No difference in acute and late toxicity rates was found between patients with different ACE-27 (Adult Comorbidity Evaluation-27) indexes and for different age. We conclude that compliance with adjuvant radiotherapy is good and rate of toxicity is acceptable in elderly patients. Patients with no or mild co-morbidities have a significantly better survival. Increasing severity of co-morbidity may sufficiently shorten remaining life expectancy to cancel gains with adjuvant radiotherapy. Further prospective trials are needed to confirm these results.", 
    "296": "In humans, both the N-terminal catalytic domain (NtMGAM) and the C-terminal catalytic domain (CtMGAM) of small intestinal maltase glucoamylase (MGAM) are \u03b1-glycosidases that catalyze the hydrolysis of \u03b1-(1\u21924) glycosidic linkages in the process of starch digestion, and are considered to be the main therapeutic targets for type 2 diabetes. In this work, recombinant human CtMGAM has been cloned for the first time, and this, combined with the expression of NtMGAM in Pichia pastoris, made it possible for us to study the catalytic mechanism of MGAM in a well-defined system. The enzymatic kinetic assays of the two catalytic domains suggest that CtMGAM has the higher affinity for longer maltose oligosaccharides. Kinetic studies of commercially-available drugs such as 1-deoxynojirimycin (DNJ), miglitol, voglibose, and acarbose along with a series of acarviosine-containing oligosaccharides we isolated from Streptomyces coelicoflavus against NtMGAM, CtMGAM, and human pancreatic \u03b1-amylase (HPA) provide us an overall profile of the inhibitory ability of these inhibitors. Of all the inhibitors used in this paper, DNJ was the most effective inhibitor against MGAM; the K(i) values for the two catalytic domains were 1.41 and 2.04 \u03bcM for NtMGAM and CtMGAM, respectively. Acarviostatins 2-03 and 3-03 were the best inhibitors against HPA with relatively high inhibitory activity against CtMGAM. The acarviostatins 2-03 and 3-03 inhibition constants, K(i), for HPA were 15 and 14.3 nM, and those for CtMGAM were 6.02 and 6.08 \u03bcM, respectively.

In one case out of five, drug intake can be related to the onset of AKI. Antibiotics, analgesics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists are the agents mostly involved, as well as iodinated radio-contrast agents. Mechanisms are often complex: toxic cellular effect directed on a nephron segment (tubular necrosis) associated or not with intraglomerular hemodynamic changes, or immune process leading to acute tubule-interstitial nephritis. Each underlying risk factor (age > 60 year, cardiac or hepatic failure, hypertension, diabetes, intra-vascular volume depletion, preexisting or unknown chronic kidney disease) must be taken into consideration by the prescribing physician because it reduces the chance of functional recovery and worsens the renal and the overall prognosis. A pre-renal additional component is often present and avoidable thanks to a strict hemodynamic monitoring. The present article summarizes some recent physiopathological aspects of AKI and makes the link between clinical situations and currently prescribed drugs. Lessons from the radio-contrast induced nephropathy are examined by taking into account prevention aspects and risk factors screening.

Am J Physiol Renal Physiol 296: F1146-F1157, 2009). To better mimic the scenario for renal disease in humans, we began curcumin and enalapril therapy when proteinuria was already established. We hypothesized that curcumin, by blocking the inflammatory mediators TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, could also reduce cyclooxygenase (COX) and phospholipase expression in the kidney. Nx animals were divided into untreated Nx, curcumin-treated, and enalapril-treated groups. Curcumin (75 mg/kg) and enalapril (10 mg/kg) were administered for 10 wk. Renal dysfunction in the Nx group, as evidenced by elevated blood urea nitrogen, plasma creatinine, proteinuria, segmental sclerosis, and tubular dilatation, was comparably reduced by curcumin and enalapril, with only enalapril significantly lowering blood pressure. Compared with controls, Nx animals had higher plasma/kidney TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, which were reduced by curcumin and enalapril treatment. Nx animals had significantly elevated kidney levels of cytosolic PLA(2), calcium-independent intracellular PLA(2), COX 1, and COX 2, which were comparably reduced by curcumin and enalapril. Studies in mesangial cells and macrophages were carried out to establish that the in vivo increase in PLA(2) and COX were mediated by TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 and that curcumin, by antagonizing the cytokines, could significantly reduce both PLA(2) and COX. We conclude that curcumin ameliorates CKD by blocking inflammatory signals even if it is given at a later stage of the disease.",

Our aim was to evaluate the effects of insulin+captopril on insulin/angiotensin signaling pathways and cardiac function in the isolated heart subjected to ischemia-reperfusion. Isolated hearts were perfused (Langendorff technique) with Krebs-Henseleit (KH) buffer for 25 min. Global ischemia was induced (20 min), followed by reperfusion (30 min) with KH (group KH), KH+angiotensin-I (group A), KH+angiotensin-I+captopril (group AC), KH+insulin (group I), KH+insulin+angiotensin-I (group IA), or KH+insulin+angiotensin-I+captopril (group IAC). Group A had a 24% reduction in developed pressure and an increase in end-diastolic pressure vs. baseline, effects that were reverted in groups AC, IA, and IAC. The phosphorylation of protein kinase B (AKT) was higher in groups I and IA vs. groups KH and A. The phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) was \u223c31% higher in groups I, IA, and IAC vs. groups KH, A, and AC.

Since the treatment of hypertension is beneficial for the elderly, we have undertaken this study that aims to evaluate the management of hypertension in elderly patient in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. Methods. A retrospective study was conducted among 854 hypertensive elderly patients of Abidjan Cardiology Institute who were followed for a minimum of one year, between January 2000 and December 2009. Results. The patients mean age was 73.1 \u00b1 5.3 years, and 59% were women. At the first presentation, it was mostly systolic-diastolic hypertension (51.8%) and isolated systolic hypertension (38.5%). Mean blood pressure was 169.4 \u00b1 28.4\u2009mmHg for systolic, 95.3 \u00b1 15.7\u2009mmHg for diastolic, and 74.1 \u00b1 22.8\u2009mmHg for pulse pressure. Pulse pressure was \u226560\u2009mmHg in 80.4%. According to the European Guidelines stratification of the cardiovascular risk-excess attributable to high blood pressure, 82.1% of the sample had a very high added risk. The pharmacological therapy was prescribed in 93.5%. More than 66% of patients were receiving \u22652 antihypertensive drugs including fixed-dose combination drugs. The most common agents used were diuretics (63.5%) followed by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers in 61.3%. The most common agents used for monotherapy were calcium antagonists. When \u22652 drugs were used, diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers were the most common. Blood pressure control was achieved in 42.6%. Conclusion. The control of elderly hypertension can be effective in Sub-Saharan Africa. He required at least two antihypertensive drugs to meet the recommended blood pressure target.",

Nevertheless its efficacy is limited to 60-80% of patients in different studies. Whether the use of pharmacological therapy after catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation might increase the procedural success rate is still a matter of debate. There is general agreement that antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) are useful in the management of arrhythmias occurring in the very early period after catheter ablation (blanking period). On the contrary, limited data are available on the efficacy of AADs over a longer period. Some patients remain free of arrhythmia recurrences by the use of AADs that were ineffective before catheter ablation: whether this latter situation is to be considered a partial success of catheter ablation or a treatment failure, thus demanding a redo procedure, is still an open question. Some studies have also investigated the role of non-AADs [angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, statins and corticosteroids] in preventing atrial fibrillation recurrences after catheter ablation, reporting conflicting results. Whereas there is a general consensus on the use of anticoagulation therapy in the first phase after catheter ablation, no definite data are available on the proper long-term management of anticoagulation therapy after catheter ablation.

This observational study was performed to evaluate the impact of adding ACEIs and/or statins to antiplatelets on post-stroke in-hospital mortality. Ischaemic stroke patients attending a hospital in Malaysia over an 18-month period were evaluated. Patients were categorized according to their vital status at discharge. Data included demographic information, risk factors, clinical characteristics and previous medications with particular attention on antiplatelets, ACEIs and statins. In-hospital mortality was compared among patients who were not taking antiplatelets, ACEIs or statins before stroke onset versus those who were taking antiplatelets alone or in combination with either ACEIs, statins or both. Data analysis was performed using SPSS version 15. Overall, 637 patients met the study inclusion criteria. After controlling for the effects of confounders, adding ACEIs or statins to antiplatelets significantly decreased the incidence of death after stroke attack by 68% (p = 0.036) and 81% (p = 0.010), respectively, compared to patients on antiplatelets alone or none of these medications. Additionally, the addition of both ACEIs and statins to antiplatelet medication resulted in the highest reduction (by 94%) of the occurrence of death after stroke attack (p < 0.001). Our results suggest that adding ACEIs and/or statins to antiplatelets for patients at risk of developing stroke, either as a primary or as a secondary preventive regimen, was associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of mortality after ischaemic stroke than antiplatelets alone. These results might help reduce the rate of ischaemic stroke morbidity and mortality by enhancing the application of specific therapeutic and management strategies for patients at a high risk of acute stroke.", 
    "342": "Concern regarding accidental overexposure to radiation has been raised after the devastating Tohuku earthquake and tsunami which initiated the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in Japan in March 2011. Radiation exposure is toxic and can be fatal depending on the dose received. Injury to the lung is often reported as part of multi-organ failure in victims of accidental exposures. Doses of radiation >8 Gray to the chest can induce pneumonitis with right ventricular hypertrophy starting after \u223c2 months. Higher doses may be followed by pulmonary fibrosis that presents months to years after exposure. Though the exact mechanisms of radiation lung damage are not known, experimental animal models have been widely used to study this injury. Rodent models for pneumonitis and fibrosis exhibit vascular, parenchymal and pleural injuries to the lung. Inflammation is a part of the injuries suggesting involvement of the immune system. Researchers worldwide have tested a number of interventions to prevent or mitigate radiation lung injury. One of the first and most successful class of mitigators are inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), an enzyme that is abundant in the lung. These results offer hope that lung injury from radiation accidents may be mitigated, since the ACE inhibitor captopril was effective when started up to 1 week after irradiation.",

Also, there is a limited role for both bile acid sequestrants and fibrates in certain subgroup of patients. It would appear that the Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are the preferred therapies for hypertension but invariably a combination therapy with additional drugs is required keeping in mind that certain drugs can exacerbate the dyslipidemia and or glycemia of MetS. Whilst metformin appears to be the drug of choice for the dysglycemia, thiazolidinediones (TZDs) like pioglitazone can also be beneficial but recent concern about bladder cancer has resulted in its discontinuation in certain countries in Europe.

To understand how these therapies have changed prognosis, we performed a cause-of-death analysis in DMD patients. Mean age at death before initiation of MV (January 1977-July 1984) was 18.9\u00b14.1 years. After the introduction of MV, from August 1984 to December 1993 (1(st) term), it was 20.0\u00b14.5 years, from January 1994 to December 2003 (2(nd) term), it was 25.2\u00b14.6 years, and from January 2004 to December 2010 (3(rd) term), it was 31.1\u00b15.4 years. Almost half of all deaths before MV were due to respiratory failure (RF). Because MV was performed by a tracheostomy in the initial stage, some patients were reluctant to use it, and as a result, RF accounted for 43% of deaths in the 1(st) term. Over time, patients started to accept non-invasive ventilation and home mechanical ventilation, which became available in the 1990s. Consequently, no DMD patients have died from RF since 2000. Respiratory physiotherapy and risk management became important tools, because many patients undergo decades of respiratory managements at home. Cardiac treatments for patients with DMD consisted mainly of diuretics and digitalis in the 1(st) term, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) in the 2(nd) term, and a combination of ACEIs and beta blockers in the 3(rd) term. Compared to the 2(nd) term, the ratios of severe cardiac dysfunction (fractional shortening <10%, left ventricle diastolic dimension >75mm, plasma brain natriuretic peptide >1,000pg/ml) were reduced in the 3(rd) term.

    "376": "Hypertension is associated with an increased risk of diastolic dysfunction. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) have failed to show improvement in clinical outcomes for patients with diastolic dysfunction. In this study, we investigated the effect of changing an ACEi or ARB to a combination of losartan and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) on left ventricular (LV) preload and relaxation in patients with hypertension and diastolic dysfunction. We enrolled 371 hypertensive patients with diastolic dysfunction who had not achieved their treatment goals with an ACEi or ARB. We switched the ACEi or ARB to losartan/HCTZ and followed the patients for 24 weeks. The primary end points were changes in septal mitral annular velocity during diastole (e') and in the ratio of mitral inflow velocity to e' velocity (E/e' ratio) from baseline to the end of follow-up. Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures (BP) decreased by 22 and 11 mm Hg, respectively, after changing from an ACEi or ARB to losartan/HCTZ. The e' velocity increased, and the E/e' ratio and brain natriuretic peptide level decreased significantly. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein also decreased significantly (0.50 vs. 0.29 mg dl(-1), P<0.0001). There were only slight or no changes in glucose levels, homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-R), uric acid and electrolytes after the drug change. Changing from an ACEi or ARB to losartan/HCTZ is associated with a reduction in BP, improvement in LV relaxation, improvement in heart failure state and attenuation of systemic inflammation with few adverse effects in patients with hypertension and diastolic dysfunction.", 
    "377": "Despite considerable advances in preventative treatment during the last two decades, the increasing burden of cardiovascular (CV) disease constitutes an urgent need for new therapeutic strategies to reduce CV mortality and morbidity in patients at high CV risk. Activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) results in vasoconstrictive, proliferative and pro-inflammatory effects that contribute to the development of atherosclerosis. As a result, the RAS is implicated at all stages of the 'CV continuum' that links risk factors such as hypertension and dyslipidaemia with major CV events, congestive heart failure (CHF) and CV death. The RAS therefore represents a rational and ideal therapeutic target in CV risk reduction strategies. Both angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) have been shown to promote beneficial effects on end-organ damage, such as decreases in arterial stiffness and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Several trials have shown that ACE inhibitors and ARBs reduce CV risk in patients with specific risk factors. Furthermore, the HOPE study and, more recently, the ONTARGET\u00ae study have shown that ramipril and telmisartan reduce CV risk in patients with a high CV risk profile across the 'CV continuum'. Telmisartan is the first ARB to demonstrate CV prevention in patients at high CV risk, similar to that of the gold-standard ACE inhibitor, ramipril. This extensive clinical trial evidence suggests that ACE inhibitors or ARBs should be part of the standard treatment for patients at risk of CV events. ARBs may represent a preferred option due to their unsurpassed tolerability.", 
    "378": "Several medications have individually been shown to reduce mortality in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS), but data on long-term outcomes related to the use of combinations of these medications are limited. For 2,684 consecutive patients admitted with ACS from January 1999 and January 2007, a composite score was calculated correlating with the use upon discharge of indicated evidence-based medications (EBMs): aspirin, \u03b2 blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, and lipid-lowering agents. Multivariate models were used to examine the impact of EBM score on 2-year events with adjustment for components of the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) risk score, thienopyridine use, and year of discharge. Women were older, had more co-morbidities, and were less likely to receive all 4 EBMs (53% vs 64%, p < 0.0001) than men. Patients who received all 4 indicated EBMs had a significant 2-year survival benefit compared to patients who received \u22641 EBM (odds ratio 0.25, 95% confidence interval 0.15 to 0.41), which was observed when men and women were examined separately (for men, odds ratio 0.22, 95% confidence interval 0.11 to 0.44; for women, odds ratio 0.3, 95% confidence interval 0.15 to 0.63). A modest benefit, in terms of cardiovascular disease events (myocardial infarction, rehospitalization, stroke, and death), was observed only for men who received all 4 EBMs. In conclusion, a combination of cardiac medications at the time of ACS discharge is strongly associated with 2-year survival in men and women, suggesting that discharge is an important time to prescribe secondary preventative medications.",

The free phenolic extract of the soybean was obtained by extraction with 80% acetone, while that of the bound phenolic extract was done by extracting the alkaline and acid hydrolyzed residue with ethyl acetate. The inhibitory action of these extracts on the enzymes activity as well as their antioxidant properties was assessed. Both phenolic-rich extracts inhibited \u03b1-amylase, \u03b1-glucosidase and ACE enzyme activities in a dose dependent pattern. However, the bound phenolic extract exhibited significantly (P < 0.05) higher \u03b1-amylase and ACE inhibition while the free phenolic extract had significantly (P < 0.05) higher \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory activity. Nevertheless, the free phenolic extract had higher \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory activity when compared to that of \u03b1-amylase; this property confer an advantage on soybean phenolic-rich extracts over commercial antidiabetic drugs with little or no side effect. And inhibition of ACE suggests the antihypertension potential of soybean phenolic-rich extracts. Furthermore, the enzyme inhibitory activities of the phenolic-rich extracts were not associated with their phenolic content. Therefore, phenolic-rich extracts of soybean could inhibit key-enzyme linked to type 2 diabetes (\u03b1-amylase and \u03b1-glucosidase) and hypertension (ACE) and thus could explain in part the mechanism by which soybean renders these health promoting effect.",

The left ventricular ejection fraction \u2265 45% if measured < 1 year before the visit was used to qualify the patients as having HF-PEF. Of the 2,536 consecutive outpatients with HF, 1990 (79%) had the EF values recorded. Of these patients, 1291 had HF-PEF, leading to an overall prevalence of 65% (95% confidence interval 63% to 67%). Compared to the patients with HF and a reduced ejection fraction, those with HF-PEF were more likely to be older (65 vs 62 years, p < 0.001), female (50% vs 28%, p < 0.001), and obese (39% vs 27%, p < 0.001). They more frequently had a history of hypertension (78% vs 53%, p < 0.001) and atrial fibrillation (29% vs 24%, p = 0.03) and less frequently had a history of myocardial infarction (21% vs 44%, p < 0.001). Only 29% of patients with HF-PEF and hypertension had optimal blood pressure control. Left ventricular hypertrophy was less frequent in those with HF-PEF (58% vs 69%, p < 0.001). The prevalence of HF-PEF was lower in the Middle East (41%), where coronary artery disease was more often found than in Latin America (69%) and North Africa (75%), where the rate of hypertension was greater. In conclusion, in the present diverse non-Western study, HF-PEF represented almost 2/3 of all HF cases in outpatients. HF-PEF mostly affects older patients, women, and the obese. Hypertension was the most frequently associated risk factor, highlighting the need for optimal blood pressure control.", 
    "416": "Residual renal function (RRF) is well recognized as an important marker of outcomes in peritoneal dialysis (PD), and contributes vitally to solute clearance. Recently, its importance in hemodialysis (HD) has emerged with evidence that it is strongly associated with improved outcomes. The presence of RRF is associated with improved nutrition, reduced erythropoetin requirements, better potassium clearance, and improved quality of life. Retrospective and observational evidence is now available, which suggests that the presence of RRF is independently associated with survival and that this benefit goes beyond what is expected simply from augmentation of small solute clearance. Preservation of RRF is now considered by many to be an important aspect of dialysis strategy. Evidence in favor of one modality over another for preservation of RRF is conflicting, as are the potential benefits of biocompatible fluids in PD. In HD, the evidence in favor of biocompatible membranes is stronger. Emerging evidence is broadly in favor of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors for preservation of RRF. Diuretics appear to have a neutral effect. The complexities and practical difficulties in measurement of RRF have resulted in this important parameter being largely ignored in HD. Novel markers of renal function may provide alternative, simple methods of estimating RRF, which may remove the need for urine collections and simplify its measurement.",

There was one death and one stroke, and 4 cases were of relapsing Takotsubo after a new seizure. Takotsubo syndrome may induce cardiac arrhythmias. A near-SUDEP (sudden unexplained death in epilepsy) was reported in one patient. Animal models of SUDEP have shown similar cardiac lesions to those seen in Takotsubo syndrome, and strengthen the hypothesis of a link between these conditions.

L-NAME treatment led to increased BP, LV hypertrophy, total fibrosis and relative content of collagens without the change in collagen type I/III ratio. Indapamide and captopril decreased BP, LV hypertrophy and the collagen ratio without affecting total fibrosis, while Provinols\u2122 reduced BP, the collagen ratio and fibrosis without affecting LV hypertrophy. The combinations decreased all the parameters. Decrease of LV hypertrophy was achieved by drugs with the best reducing effect on BP, fibrosis reduction was reached by the antioxidant treatment with only partial effect on BP.

To investigate the role of proang-12 in the production of angiotensin II (Ang II), we measured its plasma and tissue concentrations in Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) rats, with and without RAS inhibition. The 15-week-old male WKY and SHR rats were left untreated or were treated for 7 days with 30\u2009mg\u2009kg(-1) per day losartan, an angiotensin receptor blocker, or with 20\u2009mg\u2009kg(-1) per day imidapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Both treatments increased renin activity and the concentrations of angiotensin I (Ang I) and Ang II in the plasma of WKY and SHR rats, but neither affected plasma proang-12 levels. In contrast to the comparatively low level of proang-12 seen in plasma, cardiac and renal levels of proang-12 were higher than those of Ang I and Ang II. In addition, despite activation of the RAS in the systemic circulation, tissue concentrations of proang-12 were significantly reduced following treatment with losartan or imidapril. Similar reductions were also observed in the tissue concentrations of Ang II in both strains, without a reduction in Ang I. These results suggest that tissue concentrations of proang-12 and Ang II are regulated independently of the systemic RAS in WKY and SHR rats, which is consistent with the notion that proang-12 is a component of only the tissue RAS.",

Director Jay Cohn, building on his expertise in hypertension and hemodynamics, led many creative and committed investigators in the exploration of the mechanisms responsible for increased sensitivity to afterload in heart failure. The neurohormonal hypothesis of heart failure led to the development of several pharmacologic tools, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, \u03b2-adrenergic blockers, and, later, angiotensin-receptor blockers. By the late 1990s, it was understood that neurohormonal antagonists could prevent the progression of left ventricular remodeling and favorably influence the natural history of heart failure. Neurohormonal blockers are now considered standard therapy. Issues remain to be addressed, including early identification and treatment of patients at risk.",

At the approved dosage, it reduces systolic blood pressure by 12 to 15 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure by 7 to 8 mm Hg. A higher dose of azilsartan (80 mg) was superior to valsartan 320 mg or olmesartan 40 mg in lowering systolic blood pressure in short-term studies. Additional blood pressure reduction is expected when azilsartan is used adjunctively with a diuretic. However, the effects of azilsartan on cardiovascular morbidity or mortality are still lacking. Azilsartan is well tolerated; the most common side effects are headache and diarrhea. No cases of hyperkalemia have been reported in 6-week clinical trials. Worsening of renal function and hypotension should be monitored, particularly in those with baseline risk factors. It is unknown whether azilsartan would join angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and other angiotensin receptor blockers as the preferred hypertensive agents for end-organ protection. At this time, azilsartan should be considered as an alternative agent for mild-to-moderate hypertension, or as an adjunctive therapy when preferred agents fail to maintain optimal blood pressure control.

    "467": "In a substudy within the WISE, 78 women with microvascular dysfunction (coronary flow reserve [CFR] <3.0 following adenosine) and no obstructive CAD were randomly assigned to either an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (ACE-I) with quinapril or a placebo treatment group. The primary efficacy parameter was CFR at 16 weeks adjusted for baseline characteristics and clinical site. The secondary response variable was freedom from angina symptoms assessed using the Seattle Angina Questionnaire.", 
    "468": "A total of 61 women completed the 16-week treatment period with repeat CFR measurements, and treatment was well tolerated. For the primary outcome, at 16 weeks, CFR improved more with ACE-I than placebo (P < .02). For the secondary outcome of symptom improvement, ACE-I treatment (P = .037) and CFR increase (P = .008) both contributed.", 
    "469": "Microvascular function improves with ACE-I therapy in women with signs and symptoms of ischemia without obstructive CAD. This improvement is associated with reduction in angina. The beneficial response of the coronary microvasculature was limited to women with lower baseline CFR values, suggesting that the renin-angiotensin system may be more involved among women with more severe microvascular defects.", 
    "470": "Our understanding of the development and progression of atherosclerosis has increased substantially over the past decades. A significant role for the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in this process has gained appreciation in recent years. Preclinical and clinical studies have associated components of the RAAS with various cardiovascular disease conditions. Classically known for its contribution to hypertension, dysregulation of the system is now also believed to promote vascular inflammation, fibrosis, remodeling, and endothelial dysfunction, all intimately related to atherosclerosis. The reduction in cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, as seen with the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers, supports the concept that RAAS is involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic disease. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of the pathophysiology remain to be completely understood. Evidence points toward additional benefit from therapeutic approaches aiming at more complete inhibition of the system and the possible utility of renin or aldosterone in the prediction of cardiovascular outcome. This review will summarize the current knowledge from clinical studies regarding the presumptive role of renin and aldosterone in the prediction and management of patients with atherosclerosis. For this purpose, a literature search was performed, focusing on available clinical data regarding renin or aldosterone and cardiovascular outcome.", 
    "471": "The number of antihypertensive agents on the market has increased dramatically over the past 20 years. Many of these agents are used to treat children and adolescents with hypertension despite there being relatively limited data available supporting such use. Recent legislation has helped to increase the number of studies conducted in children, but many clinical questions remain unanswered.", 
    "472": "The goals of this article were to review the currently available antihypertensive agents used in the treatment of pediatric hypertension and to assist clinicians in selecting the most appropriate treatment.", 
    "473": "Searches of MEDLINE and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts through July 2011 were conducted. Search terms used included child, pediatric, hypertension, and the following drugs: captopril, enalapril, lisinopril, fosinopril, losartan, valsartan, irbesartan, candesartan, olmesartan, amlodipine, nifedipine, isradipine, felodipine, propranolol, metoprolol, labetalol, minoxidil, furosemide, spironolactone, chlorothiazide, hydrochlorothiazide, hydralazine, and prazosin. Clinical trial data were reviewed and evaluated and were limited to English-language articles.", 
    "474": "A total of 45 observational and randomized controlled trials were identified and summarized in this review. The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and calcium channel antagonists (CCAs) had the strongest data to support their use in pediatric patients. ACE inhibitors and ARBs are preferred agents for children with renal disease and have a favorable safety profile. Many trials, including 2 comparative trials, supported the use of CCAs, particularly amlodipine, in children.", 
    "475": "Trials in all 3 classes suggested their efficacy as well as a tolerable adverse-effect profile. More trials in children are needed, particularly with newer antihypertensive agents. Comparative trials of different agents are the most lacking.", 
    "476": "Clinical studies of the last 15 years have shown the benefit of pharmacological interventions on the progression of chronic kidney disease, confirming the concept of nephroprotection. Pharmacological blockade of the renin angiotensin system remains the cornerstone of the nephroprotective treatment but the benefits and limitations are now better defined. The RAS blockers are all the more efficient than the proteinuria is abundant and nephroprotection is obtained in proportion to the reduction in proteinuria. Combinations of ACEI+ARA are not validated and their use should be considered only under the supervision of a specialist when optimal monotherapy has failed. The target blood pressure has been the subject of recent controversies, particularly in type 2 diabetic patients with nephropathy. The target should be individualized based on the main risk, renal or cardiovascular. Recent maneuvers have also shown a nephroprotective effect, including the correction of metabolic acidosis with sodium bicarbonate.", 
    "477": "We have previously demonstrated that perindopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, ameliorated the cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease model animals, independently of its anti-hypertensive effect. In this study, we again investigated the effects of perindopril on cognitive function in a vascular dementia model animal, comparing it with other ACE inhibitors. We also determined ACE activity in the brain and extracellular acetylcholine (ACh) concentration in the perirhinal cortex in order to elucidate the mechanism(s) responsible for the effects of these ACE inhibitors on cognitive function. Perindopril was suggested to be more centrally active than imidapril and enalapril, in consideration of the relative distribution of their active metabolites in the brain. This property was at least partially attributed to the lipophilicity of the compound. While the 3 day treatment with perindopril, imidapril or enalapril lowered blood pressure to the same level in spontaneous hypertensive rats, only perindopril reversed the decline in the recognition index in chronic cerebral hypo-perfusion rats, regarded as an animal model of vascular dementia, during an object recognition task. Using the same dosing regimen, perindopril inhibited the brain ACE activities of rats more than imidapril or enalapril. Moreover, a single treatment with perindopril enhanced the extracellular level of ACh in the perirhinal cortex of normal rats. Therefore, we confirmed that only centrally active ACE inhibitors, such as perindopril, can inhibit the ACE in the brain, augmenting cholinergic neurotransmission and thereby ameliorating cognitive impairment in the animal model of vascular dementia.", 
    "478": "The recently published ONTARGET trial found that telmisartan was non-inferior to ramipril in reducing CV death, MI, stroke, or heart failure in patients with vascular disease or high-risk diabetes. The cost implications of ramipril and telmisartan monotherapy use based on the ONTARGET study are reported here.", 
    "479": "Only healthcare system costs were considered. Healthcare resource utilization was collected for each patient during the trial. The authors obtained country-specific unit costs to the different healthcare care resources consumed (i.e., hospitalizations events, procedures, non-study, and study drugs) for all enrolled patients. Purchasing power parities were used to convert country-specific costs into US dollars (US$ 2008). The total undiscounted costs of the study for the telmisartan group was $12,762 per patient and is higher than the ramipril group at $12,007 per patient, an un-discounted difference of $755 (95% confidence interval [CI], $218-$1292); The discounted costs for the telmisartan group was $11,722 compared with $11,019 for the ramipril group; a difference of $703 (95% CI, $209-$1197). The difference in costs is exclusively related to the acquisition cost of telmisartan over generic ramipril.", 
    "480": "This analysis only considered direct healthcare system costs. Costs accrued outside the hospital were not collected. Combination therapy was excluded since it would likely be more expensive than ramipril alone, with no additional benefit and a risk of some harm.", 
    "481": "Based on these results, it is suggested that for the ONTARGET patients, the use of telmisartan instead of ramipril increases costs by 6.3%. These findings suggest that the choice to put patients on telmisartan should be justified based on the patient?s susceptibility to specific adverse events to minimize the cost implications.", 
    "482": "The present study was designed as an open label, multiple-dose, randomized, parallel trial to evaluate the pharmacodynamic drug-drug interaction of lisinopril and concomitantly administered diclofenac sodium in non-diabetic and diabetic, mild to moderate hypertensive, osteoarthritic patients.", 
    "483": "Post-screening and on inclusion, patients were put on a 2-week washout period and then randomly assigned to either only lisinopril 10 mg or combination of lisinopril 10 mg and diclofenac sodium 100 mg treatments for 8-12 weeks in diseased states of hypertension and osteoarthritis with or without type 2 diabetes mellitus.", 
    "484": "The blood pressure (BP) control with lisinopril was reduced by concomitantly administered diclofenac sodium in non-diabetic (SBP: p=0.00002; DBP: p=0.000008) and diabetic (SBP: p=0.002; DBP: p=0.001) patients when compared with the patients receiving lisinopril alone. Insulin sensitivity was improved (p=0.00002) and urinary albumin excretion rate was better controlled (p=0.0096) in lisinopril-treated patients when compared with the combination treatment in diabetic pool. Serum creatinine levels increased significantly in non-diabetic patients (p=0.00004) receiving combination treatment. In addition, creatinine clearance (CLCR) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were significantly higher in diabetic (CLCR: p<0.00001; BUN: p=0.0098) as well as in non-diabetic (CLCR: p<0.00001; BUN: p=0.03) patients treated with combination treatment. The alterations in serum electrolytes, reduction in % platelet aggregation activity and improvement in lipid profile was more profound with combination treatment in comparison to lisinopril alone.", 
    "485": "The antihypertensive efficacy and insulin sensitivity improving property of lisinopril along with the renal function might get worse in hypertensive osteoarthritic patients receiving concomitant treatment of oral diclofenac sodium with lisinopril. In addition to this, close monitoring of serum electrolytes is also suggested to rule out any long-term detrimental effect.", 
    "486": "Although obesity is associated with overactivation of the white adipose tissue (WAT) renin-angiotensin system (RAS), a causal link between the latter and systemic insulin resistance is not established. We tested the hypothesis that overexpression of angiotensinogen (Agt) from WAT causes systemic insulin resistance via modulation of adipose inflammation. Glucose tolerance, systemic insulin sensitivity, and WAT inflammatory markers were analyzed in mice overexpressing Agt in the WAT (aP2-Agt mice). Proteomic studies and in vitro studies using 3T3-L1 adipocytes were performed to build a mechanistic framework. Male aP2-Agt mice exhibited glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, and lower insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by the skeletal muscle. The difference in glucose tolerance between genotypes was normalized by high-fat (HF) feeding, and was significantly improved by treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril. aP2-Agt mice also had higher monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and lower interleukin-10 (IL-10) in the WAT, indicating adipose inflammation. Proteomic studies in WAT showed that they also had higher monoglyceride lipase (MGL) and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase levels. Treatment with angiotensin II (Ang II) increased MCP-1 and resistin secretion from adipocytes, which was prevented by cotreating with inhibitors of the nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) pathway or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase. In conclusion, we show for the first time that adipose RAS overactivation causes glucose intolerance and systemic insulin resistance. The mechanisms appear to be via reduced skeletal muscle glucose uptake, at least in part due to Ang II-induced, NADPH oxidase and NF\u03baB-dependent increases in WAT inflammation.", 
    "487": "We are reporting the case of a bradykinin-mediated angioedema, secondary to the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, which delayed treatment could have unfavorably influence the vital prognostic of the patient. Initially, the patient had an isolated edema of the superior lip. Prehospital treatment included methylprednisolone, hydroxyzine and epinephrine. The patient was subsequently taken to the emergency department. His situation deteriorated. An edema of the cheeks and the tongue appeared. The transfer of the patient to an emergency department, specializing in kinin angioedema was organized, in order for the patient to receive specific treatments. After a subcutaneous injection of icatibant, the situation improved very rapidly, with a regression of the edema. This observation is consistent with the early use of the specific therapeutic in bradykinin-mediated angioedema. Any delay in administering the treatment can negatively impact the prognostic. The availability of such treatments should therefore be organized during the prehospital phase.", 
    "488": "Systematic reviews conducted as part of the Evidence-based Practice Center (EPC) program routinely identify evidence gaps and suggest further research to help close these gaps, but there is little evidence that these suggestions lead to the performance of the needed research. As part of an EPC-wide program to evaluate potential mechanisms for ensuring that research needs identified by systematic reviews are addressed, the Duke EPC reviewed the use of modeling techniques, including value-of-information (VOI) analysis, for prioritizing research gaps, under the assumption that quantitative prioritization could help facilitate the performance of research to address those gaps.", 
    "489": "We first searched PubMed(\u00ae) for relevant literature published in English between 1990 and 2010 using search terms related to research prioritization and VOI analysis to understand how modeling and VOI is currently used in research prioritization. Inclusion/exclusion screening criteria were aimed at identifying articles that focused on research prioritization using a formal framework or process and reported specific prioritization recommendations, with a special emphasis on modeling and VOI. To supplement this search, we then conducted a nonsystematic review of research prioritization processes used by major research-sponsoring organizations in the United States and abroad. We searched organization Web sites and the results of our literature search, and contacted the organizations by e-mail and/or telephone. Materials were reviewed for information on the focus of the prioritization process and the methods and criteria used for prioritization, again with a special emphasis on modeling/VOI. Finally, we performed two case studies of the potential use of modeling techniques in research prioritization. First, we developed a model for the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor antagonists (ARBs) in the management of ischemic heart disease based on the results of a prior comparative effectiveness review, then engaged nine stakeholders in a prioritization process that involved both a consensus-based approach and the use of model results. Second, we adapted a model on the outcomes of treatment of uterine fibroids developed for a previous systematic review and conducted a VOI analysis; these results were then shared with nine participants in a separate consensus-based research prioritization process. In both case studies, we elicited stakeholder feedback on the potential use of modeling and VOI in research prioritization.", 
    "490": "Only 6 of the 214 papers identified during the literature search reported using a previously published systematic review as the basis for identifying research gaps. Of the 60 unique modeling-based papers, all but 8 used cost-effectiveness analysis and VOI, with most of these focused on the question of immediate adaptation versus future research for a specific health intervention. The United Kingdom (UK) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) program conducted 19 of the 52 VOI analyses. Of the 31 research organizations providing information on prioritization processes, only the UK National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE), through the HTA program, explicitly included modeling and VOI in their recommendations for future research. Although the results of the modeling exercises for both case studies provided insight into the underlying decision problems, both models require further development. Despite this, stakeholders from both case study groups reported that the results of the modeling exercises were helpful in thinking about research prioritization, although none thought that modeling alone could substitute for a consensus-based approach. There was some diversity of opinion about the optimal timing of the modeling, with some stakeholders indicating that the results would be more helpful as background to a consensus-based process, while others preferred a parallel, iterative process involving both modeling and consensus.", 
    "491": "Outside of the UK NICE/HTA program, systematic reviews were rarely cited as important sources for identifying evidence gaps for research prioritization. Cost-effectiveness and VOI analyses were the most commonly used modeling-based methods, but, outside of the UK, it is unclear to what degree the priorities identified by these methods were translated into actual research funding. Stakeholders in our two case studies found modeling and VOI to be potentially useful tools, but there are a variety of methodological and operational issues that need to be considered and resolved if these methods are to be used to assist with prioritizing research gaps identified through systematic reviews. These include identifying ways to compare the impact of different prioritization methods on the likelihood that priority questions will be answered through research, identifying the appropriate resources (including technical expertise) to conduct the analyses, defining the appropriate timing of the modeling and analyses, and identifying the appropriate level of modeling complexity.",

When appropriate, quantitative meta-analysis was performed.", 
    "495": "We included 97 studies (36 new since 2007) directly comparing ACEIs versus ARBs and 3 studies directly comparing DRIs to ACEIs or ARBs. The strength of evidence remains high for equivalence between ACEIs and ARBs for blood pressure lowering and use of a single antihypertensive agent, and for superiority of ARBs over ACEIs for short-term adverse events (primarily due to cough). The new evidence did not strengthen our conclusions regarding long-term cardiovascular outcomes, quality of life, progression of renal disease, medication adherence or persistence, rates of angioedema, or differences in key patient subgroups: the strength of evidence for these outcomes remained low to moderate. For DRIs, we were not able to reach definitive conclusions for any of the outcomes of interest. Few studies involved a representative sample treated in a typical clinical setting over a long duration; treatment protocols had marked heterogeneity; and significant amounts of data about important outcomes and patient subgroups were missing.",

In patients without ACE inhibitors, no relationship was found between IGF1 levels and HF or IHD. In multivariate regression, only ACE inhibitors, ECG changes characteristic for IHD, and gender had a significant impact on IGF1. Patients with higher IGF1 levels in quintiles 4 and 5 compared to quintiles 1 and 2 had a 50% higher risk for CV death (P=0.03).

Early recognition of CKD is becoming increasingly common due to widespread laboratory estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) reporting, raised clinical awareness, and international adoption of Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (K/DOQI) classification. Early recognition and management of CKD affords the opportunity not only to prepare for progressive kidney impairment and impending renal replacement therapy, but also for intervening to reduce the risk of progression and cardiovascular disease. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) are two classes of antihypertensive drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.

Two subtypes of angiotensin II (Ang II) receptors have been defined on the basis of their differential pharmacological properties. The current study was undertaken to address the question as to whether the inhibition of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) by captopril and the AT1 and AT2 receptor blockers losartan and PD123319 modulate MI/R-induced infarct size in an in vivo rat model. To produce necrosis, a branch of the descending left coronary artery was occluded for 30 min followed by two hours of reperfusion. ECG changes, blood pressure, and heart rate were measured during the experiment. Captopril (3 mg/kg), losartan (2 mg/kg), and PD123319 (20 \u03bcg/kg/min) were given in an IV 10 min before ischemia and were continued during the ischemic period. The infarcted area was measured by TTC staining. The volume of infarct and the risk zone was determined by planimetry. Compared to the control group (55.62\u00b14.00%) both captopril and losartan significantly reduced the myocardial infarct size (30.50\u00b13.26% and 37.75\u00b14.44%), whereas neither PD123319 nor PD123319+losartan affected the infarct size volume (46.50\u00b13.72% and 54.62\u00b12.43%). Our data indicates that captopril and losartan exert cardioprotective activity after an MI/R injury. Also, infarct size reduction by losartan was halted by a blockade of the AT2 receptor. Therefore, the activation of AT2 receptors may be potentially protective and appear to oppose the effects mediated by the AT1 receptors.",

For this study, we consecutively enrolled 162 patients with uncomplicated primary hypertension, who are partial responders to the treatment with lercanidipine over a period of 24 months. Patients were then allocated to the combination of lercanidipine (10-20 mg/day) with \u03b2-blockers, diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin-II receptor blockers according to compelling indications (if any) and/or suggestions of European Society of Hypertension-European Society of Cardiology (ESH-ESC) guidelines. All the enrolled patients completed the study and no adverse drug reaction was registered during the research period. The association of a second drug with lercanidipine determined an additional BP decrease of either systolic BP or diastolic BP independently from the type of drug added (P always <.05). The additional effect of lercanidipine appears widely distributed with no significant differences in the size of BP decrease. From the metabolic point of view, the addition of a second drug did not determine a significant variation in the serum levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P always >.05). Conversely, a significant decrease in fasting plasma glucose and serum levels of triglycerides has been observed in patients where lercanidipine has been combined with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin-II receptor blocker. In conclusion, in our study we observed that lercanidipine-based protocols are well tolerated and efficacious in reducing BP. Moreover, the association of lercanidipine with renin-angiotensin system blockers is also associated with significant improvements in triglycerides and fasting plasma glucose.", 
    "535": "Regulation of the fibrinolytic balance between plasminogen activators and inhibitors is modulated by the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Impaired fibrinolytic function, characterized by increased plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) levels and decreased tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) activity, has been found in patients with hypertension and may account in part for the increased risk of atherosclerosis and its clinical complications in these patients. In this regard, data from the literature indicate that different antihypertensive drugs may vary in their influence on fibrinolysis. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (ACE-I) have generally been shown to improve the fibrinolytic balance by reducing plasma PAI-1 levels. Calcium-channel blockers (CCB) have been reported to increase t-PA activity, and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) seem to be neutral in their effect. In the light of these data, this study aimed to compare the effects of ACE-I, ARB, and CCB on the fibrinolytic system in the early and late stages of the treatment in hypertensive patients. These data that the beneficial effect of RAS inhibition on fibrinolysis related to decrease in Ang II during early period of treatment. Amlodipine may also improve thrombogenic risk related to lowering the effect on increased platelet activation reflected by p-selectin. The greater improvement in the early and late stages of the fibrinolytic balance because of the combined action of RAS inhibition and Ca antagonism represents a further indication to the use of combinations of RAS inhibition (ACE-I or ARB) and CCB in the treatment of hypertension.",

An 80% acetone extract of each leaf was fractionated on silicic acid-packed column to give two main fractions: acetone eluate (flow-through) and ethanol eluate (column-bound), that consist mostly of chlorophyllic and non-chlorophyllic fractions, respectively. Column fractionation resulted in polyphenolic fractions that displayed higher potency against angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and renin than the crude acetone extracts; generally, the chlorophyllic fraction was more active than the non-chlorophyllic fraction. ACE-inhibitory activity was significantly higher (p\u2009<\u20090.05) for the chlorophyllic fraction of VA than GL, with IC(50) values of 0.207 and 0.413\u00a0mg/ml, respectively. Similarly, the chlorophyllic fraction of VA had significantly higher (p\u2009<\u20090.05) renin inhibition than GL, with IC(50) values of 0.172 and 0.513\u00a0mg/ml, respectively. Kinetics studies showed that the chlorophyllic fractions of VA and GL exhibited mostly mixed-type ACE and renin inhibitions. We concluded that the hydrophobic nature of the chlorophyllic fraction may have contributed to the increased interaction with enzyme protein and inhibition of activities of ACE and renin.",

    "545": "Reduced alveolar Po(2) in rats produces a rapid systemic inflammation characterized by reactive O(2) species generation, mast cell (MC) degranulation, leukocyte-endothelial interactions, and increased vascular permeability. The inflammation is not initiated by the low systemic Po(2) but rather by the release of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) from alveolar macrophages (AMO) activated by alveolar hypoxia. Circulating AMO-borne MCP-1 induces MC degranulation, which activates the local renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and mediates the microvascular inflammation. This study was directed to determine the mechanism of RAS activation by MCP-1-induced MC degranulation. Experiments in isolated rat peritoneal MCs showed the following: 1) Western blots and immunocytochemistry demonstrated the presence of renin and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in MCs and their release upon degranulation; 2) MCP-1-induced degranulation of MCs incubated in plasma produced an increase in angiotensin II (ANG II) concentration; and 3) this increase was inhibited completely by the following agents: the MCP-1 receptor antagonist RS-102895, the specific rat renin inhibitor WFML, or the ACE inhibitor captopril administered separately. Captopril also inhibited ANG II generation by MCs incubated in culture medium plus ANG I. The results show that peritoneal MCs contain active renin, which activates the RAS upon degranulation, and that peritoneal MCs are a source of ACE and suggest that conversion of ANG I to ANG II is mediated predominantly by ACE. This study provides novel evidence of the presence of active renin in rat peritoneal MCs and helps explain the mechanism of activation of the RAS during alveolar hypoxia.", 
    "546": "Angiotensin (ANG)-converting enzyme (ACE)2 in brain regions such as the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) controlling cardiovascular function may be involved in the regulation of sympathetic outflow in chronic heart failure (CHF). The purpose of this study was to determine if ACE2 plays a role in the central regulation of sympathetic outflow by regulating neuronal nitric oxide (NO) synthase (nNOS) in the PVN. We investigated ACE2 and nNOS expression within the PVN of rats with CHF. We then determined the effects of ACE2 gene transfer in the PVN on the contribution of NO-mediated sympathoinhibition in rats with CHF. The results showed that there were decreased expressions for ACE2, the ANG-(1-7) receptor, and nNOS within the PVN of rats with CHF. After the application of adenovirus vectors encoding ACE2 (AdACE2) into the PVN, the increased expression of ACE2 in the PVN was confirmed by Western blot analysis. AdACE2 transfection significantly increased nNOS protein levels (change of 50 \u00b1 5%) in the PVN of CHF rats. In anesthetized rats, AdACE2 treatment attenuated the responses of renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA), mean arterial pressure, and heart rate to the NOS inhibitor N-monomethyl-L-arginine in rats with CHF (RSNA: 28 \u00b1 3% vs. 16 \u00b1 3%, P < 0.05) compared with CHF + AdEGFP group. Furthermore, neuronal NG-108 cells incubated with increasing doses of AdACE2 showed a dose-dependent increase in nNOS protein expression (60% at the highest dose). Taken together, our data highlight the importance of increased expression and subsequent interaction of ACE2 and nNOS within the PVN, leading to a reduction in sympathetic outflow in the CHF condition.",

In 2008, 47.8 million prescriptions were written for HCTZ alone and 87.1 million prescriptions for HCTZ combinations. However, there is no evidence that HCTZ in its usual dose of 12.5-25 mg daily reduces myocardial infarction, stroke, or death. In a meta-analysis of 19 randomized trials with over 1400 patients, the 24-hour decrease in blood pressure with HCTZ was inferior to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-blockers, and calcium channel blockers (P <.001 for all). Even in combination with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, HCTZ was found to reduce morbidity and mortality less well than a calcium channel blocker. As measured by the adherence rate, thiazides are less well tolerated than any other drug class. Because outcome data at the usual daily dose of 12.5-25 mg are lacking, antihypertensive efficacy is paltry, and adherence is poor, HCTZ is an inappropriate first-line drug in hypertension.

The inhibitory potential increased with roasting degree. No or only slight inhibition of other zinc-containing peptidases closely related to MMPs, namely, Clostridium histolyticum collagenase and angiotensin converting enzyme, was found, indicating specific structural features of melanoidins to be responsible for the interaction with MMPs. A continuous increase on the apparent molecular weight of melanoidins as well as incorporation of phenolic substances into the melanoidin structure with progress of roasting was observed, concomitant with a significant increase in the carbon/nitrogen of the melanoidins. This suggests that the melanoidins are mainly formed by incorporation of carbohydrates and phenolic compounds onto a proteinaceous backbone. As MMP-1, MMP-2, and MMP-9 play a pivotal role in pathogenesis of colorectal cancer, studies on possible physiological effects of melanoidins are mandatory.",

Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS), direct infusion electrospray mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and matrix-assisted desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) were applied to characterize the peptides of both snake venoms. 32 bradykinin-potentiating peptides (BPPs) were identified in the Crotalinae venom and their sequences determined. 3 metalloproteinase inhibitors, 10 BPPs and a Kunitz-type inhibitor were observed in the Viperinae venom peptidome. Variability in the C-terminus of homologous BPPs was observed, which can influence the pharmacological effects. The data obtained so far show a subfamily specificity of the venom peptidome in the Viperidae family: BPPs are the major peptide component of the Crotalinae venom peptidome lacking Kunitz-type inhibitors (with one exception) while the Viperinae venom, in addition to BPPs, can contain peptides of the bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor family. We found indications for a post-translational phosphorylation of serine residues in Bothrops jararacussu venom BPP (S[combining low line]QGLPPGPPIP), which could be a regulatory mechanism in their interactions with ACE, and might influence the hypotensive effect. Homology between venom BPPs from Viperidae snakes and venom natriuretic peptide precursors from Elapidae snakes suggests a structural similarity between the respective peptides from the peptidomes of both snake families. The results demonstrate that the venoms of both snakes are rich sources of peptides influencing important physiological systems such as blood pressure regulation and hemostasis.

Increased urinary loss of vitamin D binding protein (VDBP), the main transporter of 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) in the circulation, has been postulated to contribute to vitamin D deficiency in proteinuria. To test this hypothesis we analyzed urinary and plasma levels of VDBP, 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) from proteinuric patients, before and after antiproteinuric interventions. We performed a post-hoc analysis of a clinical trial in CKD patients (n=13, creatinine clearance median 60 (range 25-177) ml/min) subjected to the following study periods: washout (no antiproteinuric treatment, 4 weeks), lisinopril 40mg QD (ACEi, 6 weeks), or indomethacin 75mg BID (NSAID, 4 weeks) in randomized sequence. Healthy subjects screened for donation (n=10) served as controls. Plasma and urine VDBP levels were measured by ELISA, 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) levels by LC-MS and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) levels by radioimmunoassay. In CKD patients urinary VDBP excretion was strongly increased (median (range) 5413 (155-211,027) \u03bcg/24h) as compared to healthy controls (64 (23-111) \u03bcg/24h, p<0.001). Both NSAID and ACEi significantly decreased urinary VDBP excretion, in proportion to proteinuria reduction. Plasma VDBP, 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) levels, however, were similar between patients and controls and not affected by antiproteinuric intervention. Urinary VDBP excretion is markedly increased in proteinuria and responds to antiproteinuric treatment. Urinary VDBP loss is not associated with plasma VDBP or vitamin D(3) levels, suggesting that urinary loss of VDBP does not affect vitamin D status.",

    "567": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors ameliorate the progression of renal disease. In combination with vitamin D receptor activators, they provide additional benefits. In the present study, uremic (U) rats were treated as follows: U+vehicle (UC), U+enalapril (UE; 25 mg/l in drinking water), U+paricalcitol (UP; 0.8 \u03bcg/kg ip, 3 \u00d7 wk), or U+enalapril+paricalcitol (UEP). Despite hypertension in UP rats, proteinuria decreased by 32% vs. UC rats. Enalapril alone, or in combination with paricalcitol, further decreased proteinuria (\u224870%). Glomerulosclerosis and interstitial infiltration increased in UC rats. Paricalcitol and enalapril inhibited this. The increase in cardiac atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) seen in UC rats was significantly decreased by paricalcitol. Enalapril produced a more dramatic reduction in ANP. Renal oxidative stress plays a critical role in inflammation and progression of sclerosis. The marked increase in p22(phox), a subunit of NADPH oxidase, and decrease in endothelial nitric oxide synthase were inhibited in all treated groups. Cotreatment with both compounds inhibited the uremia-induced increase in proinflammatory inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and glutathione peroxidase activity better than either compound alone. Glutathione reductase was also increased in UE and UP rats vs. UC. Kidney 4-hydroxynonenal was significantly increased in the UC group compared with the normal group. Combined treatment with both compounds significantly blunted this increase, P < 0.05, while either compound alone had no effect. Additionally, the expression of Mn-SOD was increased and CuZn-SOD decreased by uremia. This was ameliorated in all treatment groups. Cotreatment with enalapril and paricalcitol had an additive effect in increasing CuZn-SOD expression. In conclusion, like enalapril, paricalcitol alone can improve proteinuria, glomerulosclerosis, and interstitial infiltration and reduce renal oxidative stress. The effects of paricalcitol may be amplified when an ACE inhibitor is added since cotreatment with both compounds seems to have an additive effect on ameliorating uremia-induced changes in iNOS and CuZn-SOD expression, peroxidase activity, and renal histomorphometry.", 
    "568": "We investigated the influence of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) treatment and physical exercise on arterial pressure (AP) and heart rate variability (HRV) in volunteer patients with hypertension. A total of 54 sedentary volunteers were divided into three groups: normotensive (NT Group), hypertensive (HT Group) and HT volunteers treated with ACEi (ACEi Group). All volunteers underwent an aerobic physical-training protocol for 15 weeks. HRV was investigated using a spectral analysis of a time series of R-R interval (RRi) that was obtained in a supine position and during a tilt test. Physical training promoted a significant reduction in the mean arterial pressure of the HT group (113\u00b13 vs. 106\u00b11 mm Hg) and the ACEi group (104\u00b12 vs. 98\u00b12 mm Hg). Spectral analysis of RRi in the supine position before physical training demonstrated that the NT and ACEi groups had similar values at low frequency (LF; 0.04-0.15 Hz) and high frequency (HF; 0.15-0.5 Hz) oscillations. The HT group had an increase in LF oscillations in absolute and normalized units and a decrease in HF oscillations in normalized units compared with the other groups. The HT group had the lowest responses to the tilt test during LF oscillations in normalized units. Physical training improved the autonomic modulation of the heart rate in the supine position only in the HT group. Physical training promoted a similar increase in autonomic modulation responses in the tilt test in all groups. Our findings show that aerobic physical training improves cardiac autonomic modulation in HT volunteers independently of ACEi treatment.",

    "570": "The classical renin-angiotensin system (RAS) consists of enzymes and peptides that regulate blood pressure and electrolyte and fluid homeostasis. Angiotensin II (Ang II) is one of the most important and extensively studied components of the RAS. The beneficial effects of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure, among other diseases, are well known. However, it has been reported that patients chronically treated with effective doses of these inhibitors do not show suppression of Ang II formation, suggesting the involvement of pathways alternative to ACE in the generation of Ang II. Moreover, the finding that the concentration of Ang II is preserved in the kidney, heart and lungs of mice with an ACE deletion indicates the important role of alternative pathways under basal conditions to maintain the levels of Ang II. Our group has characterized the serine protease elastase-2 as an alternative pathway for Ang II generation from Ang I in rats. A role for elastase-2 in the cardiovascular system was suggested by studies performed in heart and conductance and resistance vessels of normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive rats. This mini-review will highlight the pharmacological aspects of the RAS, emphasizing the role of elastase-2, an alternative pathway for Ang II generation.",

An increased frequency of BP control to either target did not have any consistent effect on the adjusted risk of myocardial infarction and heart failure. The adjusted risk of CV events was reduced by increasing the frequency of BP control to <140/90 mm Hg, but not to <130/80 mm Hg.

    "623": "Several studies in the last years have shown that a dysfunction of coronary microcirculation may be responsible for abnormalities in coronary blood flow and some clinical pictures. Coronary microvascular dysfunction, in absence of other coronary artery abnormalities, can cause anginal symptoms, resulting in a condition named microvascular angina (MVA). MVA can occur in a chronic form, predominantly related to effort (stable MVA), more frequently referred as cardiac syndrome X, or in an acute form, most frequently ensuing at rest, which simulates an acute coronary syndrome (unstable MVA). The main abnormalities characterizing these two forms of MVA consist of an impaired vasodilation and an increased vasoconstriction of small resistive coronary arteries, respectively. The mechanisms responsible for stable MVA are still unclear, but seem to include, together with the known traditional cardiovascular risk factors, an abnormally increased cardiac adrenergic activity. The prognosis of stable MVA is good, but some patients have progressive worsening of symptoms. Clinical outcome of patients with unstable MVA is substantially unknown, as there are no specific studies about this population. Treatment of stable MVA includes traditional anti-ischemic drugs as first step; in case of persisting symptoms several other drugs have been proposed, including xanthine derivatives, ACE-inhibitors, statins and, in women, estrogens. Severe forms of intense constriction (or spasm) of small coronary arteries may cause transmural myocardial ischemia, as the microvascular form of variant angina and the tako-tsubo syndrome.",

Moreover, the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis directly activates endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase and NO generation in the heart. However, the role of ACE2 in cardiovascular remodeling induced by persistent inhibition of NO under chronic activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) remains poorly understood.",

Persistent NO inhibition with NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) was started at 8 weeks of age for 4 weeks. After administration of L-NAME, blood pressure (BP) markedly increased in the chimeric mice (hRN/hANG-Tg), whereas wild-type mice (C57BL/6J) showed little increase in BP. Cardiovascular remodeling with enhanced oxidative stress in hRN/hANG-Tg was markedly accelerated by NO inhibition compared with that in wild-type mice. Moreover, ACE2 mRNA expression and activity in cardiac tissue were markedly reduced in L-NAME-treated hRN/hANG-Tg. Co-administration of an angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor blocker (ARB), olmesartan, inhibited L-NAME-induced cardiovascular remodeling and improved the reduction in cardiac ACE2. The preventive effect of olmesartan on cardiac hypertrophy was blunted by co-administration of a selective Ang-(1-7) antagonist, [D-Ala7]-Ang-(1-7).",

Overlapped data was quantitatively resolved by using chemometric methods, viz. inverse least squares (ILS), principal component regression (PCR) and partial least squares (PLS). Calibrations were constructed using the absorption data matrix corresponding to the concentration data matrix. The linearity range was found to be 1-5, 10-50 and 2-10 \u03bcg mL-1 for ramipril, aspirin and atorvastatin calcium, respectively. The absorbance matrix was obtained by measuring the zero-order absorbance in the wavelength range between 210 and 320 nm. A training set design of the concentration data corresponding to the ramipril, aspirin and atorvastatin calcium mixtures was organized statistically to maximize the information content from the spectra and to minimize the error of multivariate calibrations. By applying the respective algorithms for PLS 1, PCR and ILS to the measured spectra of the calibration set, a suitable model was obtained. This model was selected on the basis of RMSECV and RMSEP values. The same was applied to the prediction set and capsule formulation. Mean recoveries of the commercial formulation set together with the figures of merit (calibration sensitivity, selectivity, limit of detection, limit of quantification and analytical sensitivity) were estimated. Validity of the proposed approaches was successfully assessed for analyses of drugs in the various prepared physical mixtures and formulations.",

Coated donut shaped tablets were prepared and in vitro release was studied in simulated gastric fluid at three different RPMs. New Zealand albino male rabbits have been used as animal model for in vivo study. A sensitive and simple HPLC method was developed for the determination of captopril content in rabbit plasma. In vitro release studies showed that release patterns followed zero order for around 4h. Single oral administration of coated donut shaped tablets in rabbit illustrated retained availability of captopril to the injected drug. Captopril content could pursue the same release pattern over the same time course in in vivo study. The in vivo-in vitro correlation coefficients obtained from point-to-point analysis were greater than 99% between concentrations at certain time points obtained from release study in simulated gastric fluid at different RPMs and HPLC analysis of rabbit's plasma. From the in vitro-in vivo correlation prediction it was evident that the coated donut shaped tablet is a good device for controlled delivery of captopril.",

Therefore, it was further purified and obtained two peptides with amino acid sequences of Thr-Cys-Ser-Pro (388 Da) and Thr-Gly-Gly-Gly-Asn-Val (485.5 Da). The antioxidant activity of the purified peptides was performed by electron spin resonance technique. Moreover, their intracellular free radical scavenging activity using 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate and the protective effect against oxidation-induced DNA damage were evaluated in mouse macrophages (RAW 264.7 cells).

The initial univariate analysis showed that use of \u03b2 blockers was associated with improved survival in all patients (p = 0.03), in patients with type A overall (p = 0.02), and in patients with type A who received surgery (p = 0.006). The analysis also showed that use of calcium channel blockers was associated with improved survival in patients with type B overall (p = 0.02) and in patients with type B receiving medical management (p = 0.03). Multivariate models also showed that the use of \u03b2 blockers was associated with improved survival in those with type A undergoing surgery (odds ratio 0.47, 95% confidence interval 0.25 to 0.90, p = 0.02) and the use of calcium channel blockers was associated with improved survival in patients with type B medically treated patients (odds ratio 0.55, 95% confidence interval 0.35 to 0.88, p = 0.01). In conclusion, the present study showed that use of \u03b2 blockers was associated with improved outcome in all patients and in type A patients (overall as well as in those managed surgically).

In analysis of HM we considered number of isolated and paired ventricular extrasystoles (VE), episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), duration of episodes of ST segment depression on 24-hour ECG. Pharmacoeconomical analysis of 2 therapy regimes was conducted by the method of calculation of cost/efficacy ratio for each parameter. Stabilization of state was achieved before study in all patients at the background of standard therapy with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, cardiac glycosides, diuretics, beta-adrenoblockers.

    "635": "The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is highly prevalent and confers an increased risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. A key early event in atherosclerosis is endothelial dysfunction. Numerous groups have reported endothelial dysfunction in MetS. However, the measurement of endothelial function is far from optimum. There has been much interest recently in a subtype of progenitor cells, termed endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), that can circulate, proliferate, and dfferentiate into mature endothelial cells. EPCs can be characterized by the assessment of surface markers, CD34 and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2, VEGFR-2 (KDR). The CD34(+)KDR(+) phenotype has been demonstrated to be an independent predictor of cardiovascular outcomes. MetS patients without diabetes or cardiovascular diseases have decreased EPC number and functionality as evidenced by decreased numbers of colony forming units, decreased adhesion and migration, and decreased tubule formation. Strategies that have been shown to upregulate and enhance EPC number and functionality include statins, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and peroxisome-proliferator-activating-receptor gamma agonists. Mechanisms by which they affect EPC number and functionality need to be studied. Thus, EPC number and/or functionality could emerge as novel cellular biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular disease risk in MetS.",

Plasma prorenin was elevated in diabetic patients. Urinary prorenin was undetectable. Urinary albumin and renin were higher in diabetic patients. Men had higher plasma renin/prorenin levels, and lower plasma angiotensinogen levels than women. Plasma creatinine and albumin were also higher in men. Urinary RAAS components showed no sexual dimorphism, whereas urinary creatinine and albumin were higher in men. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers increased plasma renin and decreased plasma angiotensinogen, without altering plasma aldosterone. In contrast, in urine, these drugs decreased renin and aldosterone without affecting angiotensinogen. When analyzing all patients together, urinary angiotensinogen excretion closely mimicked that of albumin, whereas urinary angiotensinogen and albumin levels both were 0.05% or less of their concomitant plasma levels. This may reflect the identical glomerular filtration and tubular handling of both proteins, which have a comparable molecular weight. In contrast, urinary renin excretion did not correlate with urinary albumin excretion, and the urinary/plasma concentration ratio of renin was more than 200 times the ratio of albumin, despite its comparable molecular weight. Urinary aldosterone excretion closely followed urinary creatinine excretion.", 
    "638": "The increased urinary renin levels in diabetes and the decreased urinary renin levels following RAAS blockade, occurring independently of changes in plasma renin, reflect the activated renal RAAS in diabetes and the success of RAAS blockade in the kidney, respectively.

    "645": "Body sodium works together with the plasma renin-angiotensin system to ensure adequate blood flow to the tissues. Body sodium content determines the extracellular fluid (ECF) volume ensuring that, with each heart beat, a sufficient volume of fluid is delivered into the arterial space. At the same time the kidneys monitor ECF volume and blood pressure (BP), so that the juxtaglomerular cells can adjust their net secretion rate of renin to maintain an appropriate plasma renin activity (PRA) level. Plasma renin produces angiotensin II (Ang II) to constrict the arterioles and thereby ensure sufficient BP to deliver an appropriate rate of flow for cardiovascular homeostasis. The low renin, sodium-volume dependent (V) form of essential hypertension occurs whenever body sodium content increases beyond the point where plasma renin-angiotensin vasoconstrictor activity is turned off. In contrast, medium to high renin (R) hypertension occurs when too much renin is secreted relative to the body sodium content. Thus, BP = V \u00d7 R. This volume-vasoconstriction dual support of long-term hypertension is validated by the fact that all effective long-term antihypertensive drug types are either (i) natriuretic to reduce body salt and volume content (anti-V), or (ii) antirenin to reduce or block the activity of the circulating renin-angiotensin system (anti-R). The PRA test defines the relative participation of the concurrent volume and vasoconstrictor factors. In the hypertensive patient PRA testing can guide initiation, addition or subtraction of anti-V or anti-R antihypertensive drug types to thereby improve BP control and prognosis while reducing drug type usage and cost.",

Removal of endogenous angiotensin (Ang)-(1-7) tone using a receptor blocker does not further lower BRS. Therefore, we assessed whether blockade of Ang II with a receptor antagonist or combined reduction in Ang II and restoration of endogenous Ang-(1-7) levels with Ang-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition will improve BRS in these animals. Bilateral solitary tract nucleus (nTS) microinjections of the AT(1) receptor blocker, candesartan (CAN, 24\u2009pmol in 120\u2009nl, n=9), or a peptidic ACE inhibitor, bradykinin (BK) potentiating nonapeptide (Pyr-Trp-Pro-Arg-Pro-Gln-Ile-Pro-Pro; BPP9\u03b1, 9\u2009nmol in 60\u2009nl, n=12), in anesthetized male (mRen2)27 rats (15-25 weeks of age) show that AT(1) receptor blockade had no significant effect on BRS, whereas microinjection of BPP9\u03b1 improved BRS over 60-120\u2009min. To determine whether Ang-(1-7) or BK contribute to the increase in BRS, separate experiments using the Ang-(1-7) receptor antagonist D-Ala(7)-Ang-(1-7) or the BK antagonist HOE-140 showed that only the Ang-(1-7) receptor blocker completely reversed the BRS improvement. Thus, acute AT(1) blockade is unable to reverse the effects of long-term Ang II overexpression on BRS, whereas ACE inhibition restores BRS over this same time frame. As the BPP9\u03b1 potentiation of BK actions is a rapid phenomenon, the likely mechanism for the observed delayed increase in BRS is through ACE inhibition and elevation of endogenous Ang-(1-7).",

Median monthly GFR decline (interquartile range [IQR]) was 0.32 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) (IQR: 0.16-0.50 mL/min per 1.73 m(2)) on combined therapy, 0.36 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) (IQR: 0.18-0.53 mL/min per 1.73 m(2)) on delapril, and 0.30 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) (IQR: 0.12-0.50 mL/min per 1.73 m(2)) on placebo (P=0.87 and P=0.53 versus combined therapy or delapril, respectively). Similar findings were observed when baseline GFR values were not considered for slope analyses. Albuminuria was stable in the 3 treatment groups. The hazard ratio (95% CI) for major cardiovascular events between combined therapy and placebo was 0.17 (0.04-0.78; P=0.023). Among 192 subjects without retinopathy at inclusion, the hazard ratio for developing retinopathy between combined therapy and placebo was 0.27 (0.07-0.99; P=0.048). Among 200 subjects with centralized neurological evaluation, the odds ratios for peripheral neuropathy at 3 years between combined therapy or delapril and placebo were 0.45 (0.24-0.87; P=0.017) and 0.52 (0.27-0.99; P=0.048), respectively. Glucose disposal rate decreased from 5.8\u00b12.4 to 5.3\u00b11.9 mg/kg per min on placebo (P=0.03) but did not change on combined or delapril therapy. Treatment was well tolerated. In hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients, combined manidipine and delapril therapy failed to slow GFR decline but safely ameliorated cardiovascular disease, retinopathy, and neuropathy and stabilized insulin sensitivity.",

Collaborative transplant study data were analyzed according to whether kidney transplant recipients were treated with ACEi/ARB at year 1. Twenty-four thousand and ninety patients were studied of whom 9079 (38%) patients received ACEi/ARB. There were 872 nonskin malignancies during years 2-8 posttransplant, including 107 respiratory/intrathoracic tumors. The standardized incidence ratio (SIR) for all nonskin malignancies was similar between the ACEi/ARB (1.91) and no ACEi/ARB (1.81) groups (p = 0.42). For respiratory/intrathoracic tumors, however, SIR was significantly higher with ACEi/ARB (1.65 vs. 1.09 for no ACEi/ARB, p = 0.033). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that ACEi/ARB treatment was not associated with an increased risk of respiratory/intrathoracic tumors in nonsmokers. In patients with a history of smoking, however, the risk of respiratory/intrathoracic tumors was 2.77 (95% CI 1.19-6.43, p = 0.018) in patients without ACEi/ARB treatment as compared to 7.10 (95% CI 3.27-15.4, p < 0.001) in patients treated with ACEi/ARB.

IMD is not a pharmacopeial raw material, therefore there is no official method for its determination and purity assessment. The following analytical techniques were adopted for IMD determination: reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and first derivative (1D) ultraviolet spectrophotometry. RP-HPLC analysis was performed with the use of LiChrosfer RP-18 column as a stationary phase and acetonitrile-methanol-phosphate buffer pH 2.0 (60:10:30 v/v/v) as a mobile phase. The proposed method showed good linearity (in a range 40.0 - 400.0 microg/mL), accuracy, precision and selectivity for: IMD, its degradation product, and for oxymetazoline as an internal standard (IS). Additionally, different spectrophotometric methods were tested, and the first derivative spectrophotometry was accepted for further research. This method showed good linearity (in a range 4.0 - 40.0 microg/mL), precision and accuracy. The proposed methods were successfully applied to the pharmaceutical dosage form containing the investigated compound without any interference from the excipients. Finally, the results of the suggested methods were statistically compared using t-Student and F-Snedecor tests in the assessment for their equivalence.", 
    "669": "The incidence of cardiovascular events in hypertensive patients is clearly related to a left ventricular mass during treatment, and a regression of left ventricular hypertrophy is associated with a better prognosis. This is the case even independently of changes in other risk factors, including blood pressure. Evidence indicates that lifestyle modifications such as dietary salt restriction and weight loss are effective means in preventing the development of hypertension and reducing blood pressure and left ventricular mass in hypertensive patients. Salt restriction may also reduce the long-term risk of cardiovascular events. It has been recognized that the primary targets of current antihypertensive drugs are the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, calcium homeostasis, the ionic transport mechanisms in the kidneys, and the sympathetic nervous system. Clinical as well as experimental studies have demonstrated the cardioprotective effects of antihypertensive drugs independently of their blood pressure lowering effects. Hypertension is often complicated by other disease states including diabetes, dyslipidemia, and ischemic heart disease. Some of the drugs used for the treatment of such complications are also shown to produce cardioprotective effects in addition to their original effects. We ought to better understand these pleiotropic effects for the most effective treatments of hypertension and its complications.",

We evaluated the incidence of hypertension, associated risk factors, and utilization of antihypertensive drugs in the NICU using a large, geographically diverse pediatric database. A total of 123,847 NICU encounters were identified in the database. After exclusion of the 44,861 neonates with congenital cardiac disorders, 764 (1%) were coded with the diagnosis of hypertension. On multivariate analysis, the risk for hypertension was greatest in those neonates with a high All Patient Refined Diagnosis Related Groups (APR-DRG) severity of illness assessment (OR = 35.8), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (OR = 3.8), coexisting renal disorder (OR = 4.7), and renal failure (OR = 2.4). Of the 441 (57.7%) infants receiving antihypertensive medication, the median duration of exposure was 10 days, and 45% were exposed to more than one antihypertensive medication. Vasodilators were used in 64.2% of hypertensive neonates, followed by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (50.8%), calcium channel blockers (24%), and alpha- and beta-blockers (18.4%). Although hypertension occurs infrequently in the NICU, certain neonates are at increased risk for this condition. Hypertensive infants are frequently exposed to antihypertensive medications, often to several different agents during their NICU course of treatment.", 
    "671": "GABA(A) and GABA(B) receptors activation with agonists muscimol and baclofen, respectively in the lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPBN), induces water and hypertonic NaCl intake in rats. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of previous injections of losartan (AT(1) angiotensin receptor antagonist) into the LPBN on 0.3M NaCl and water intake induced by baclofen injected bilaterally in the same area in fluid replete rats and in rats treated with the diuretic furosemide combined with a low dose of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril injected subcutaneously. Male Wistar rats with stainless steel cannulas implanted bilaterally into the LPBN were used. Bilateral injections of baclofen (0.5 nmol/0.2 \u03bcl, n=6) into the LPBN in fluid replete rats induced 0.3M NaCl intake (22.4 \u00b1 6.5 vs. saline: 0.1 \u00b1 0.1 ml/210 min) and water intake (14.2 \u00b1 4.0 vs. saline: 0.6 \u00b1 0.6 ml/210 min) and pre-treatment of the LPBN with losartan (50 \u03bcg/0.2 \u03bcl) reduced 0.3M NaCl intake (7.4 \u00b1 7.0 ml/210 min) and water intake (2.8 \u00b1 2.4 ml/210 min) induced by baclofen. In rats treated with furosemide+captopril, pre-treatment with losartan into the LPBN attenuated the increase in 0.3M NaCl intake (13.3 \u00b1 3.2 vs. saline+baclofen: 24.3 \u00b1 3.9 ml/180 min) and water intake (4.8 \u00b1 2.1 vs. saline+baclofen: 19.5 \u00b1 6.6 ml/180 min) produced by baclofen. We conclude that baclofen may produce a non-specific blockade of the inhibitory mechanisms of LPBN (deactivation of LPBN inhibitory mechanisms) and this blockade is facilitated by angiotensin II acting on AT(1) receptors in the LPBN, which drives rats to ingest large amounts of water and hypertonic NaCl independent if rats are fluid depleted or normohydrated.",

Although attributed to bradykinin released during contact system activation by OSCS, no final evidence until now exists for a bradykinin release during incubation of contaminated heparin with human plasma. The first objective of our study was to measure and to characterize the kinetic profile of bradykinin release in human plasma incubated with OSCS and contaminated heparin. As these AR occurred mainly in the first minutes of the dialysis session, we examine the different factors likely to influence the kinin-forming capacity of OSCS: dilution of plasma, presence of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, capacity of the patient to metabolise kinins.",

    "677": "A series of peptides, derived from an ACE inhibitory peptide (VTVNPYKWLP) found in our previous work, were synthesized. Their half maximal inhibition concentrations (IC(50)) for ACE inhibition have been determined. The effect of amino acid sequence on ACE inhibition was discussed on the basis of IC(50) of the synthetic peptides, and the following characteristics of the ACE inhibitory peptide have been clarified. First, the active portion of this peptide for ACE inhibition is KW. Second, the amino acid sequences near this dipeptide (KW) have a strong effect on the inhibitory activity. Especially, the proline residue in the C-terminal end strongly enhanced ACE inhibition. It should be noted that the IC(50) value of KWLP (5.5 \u03bcM) is the same as the ACE inhibitory peptide (VTVNPYKWLP) and that the IC(50) value of KW is 7.8 \u03bcM. The stability and absorption efficiency in vivo would be significantly improved by shortening the peptide length from 10 amino acids to four amino acids or two amino acids.", 
    "678": "Blood pressure control is a key element in any cardiovascular prevention strategy. However, it is also one of the least frequently achieved goals in modern strategies for the clinical management of cardiovascular diseases, resulting in high impact in terms of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Among different factors that can be identified as the causes of poor blood pressure (BP) control in the general population of patients with hypertension, the excessive use of monotherapy, as opposed to combination therapy, is arguably one of the most significant. In this perspective, the use of combination therapies having synergic and complementary actions has been shown to reduce BP levels to increase the percentage of patients who respond to antihypertensive treatment and achieve the recommended BP targets. Moreover, recent studies have demonstrated that these strategies provide effective protection against hypertension-related organ damage, as well as a significant reduction of major cardiovascular events. While currently available evidence supports an increasingly important role of combination therapies compared with monotherapies, several other issues remain to be clarified. Among these, it has not yet been clearly established which classes of drugs should be considered for combination strategies, at what doses each component should be used, and whether combination strategies may be definitively considered as a first choice for the treatment of hypertensive patients at cardiovascular risk. Another relevant aspect concerns the choice between fixed and free combination therapies. This article discusses and analyses the different factors that may contribute to achieve effective BP control. In particular, the potential benefits and drawbacks associated with the use of fixed versus free combination therapies for hypertension treatment will be examined and discussed. The benefits of using combination strategies based on drugs that antagonize the renin-angiotensin system and dihydropyridine calcium antagonists will also be discussed, with a particular focus on amlodipine besylate combination therapies.", 
    "679": "Volume retention is the hallmark of progressive heart failure, both systolic and diastolic (heart failure with preserved ejection fraction). It represents the cause of the main symptoms (dyspnea, edema, liver synthesis) and also the main target of drug therapy. Antagonizing excessive volume retention is also the most important therapy element. Many patients can be stabilized with sequential nephron blockade (thiazide\u2009+\u2009loop diuretics) combined with afterload reduction [blockade of the RAAS (renin-angiotensin-aldosterone) system]. Personal patient coaching combined with telemetric components (weight, blood pressure) has evolved as another cornerstone of treatment in heart failure patients. If these measures are insufficient to control volume retention, renal replacement therapy is effective and can improve quality of life. More specifically, aquaresis via peritoneal dialysis has been shown to be effective and adequate to control volume overload. Many patients may qualify for this evolving therapy as it effectively prevents repeat hospitalization for heart failure decompensation, can be performed in an out-patient setting and has a low complication rate, thus significantly improving quality of life.", 
    "680": "Activation of renin-angiotensin system has been linked to cardiovascular and autonomic dysfunctions in diabetes. Experiments were performed to investigate the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), enalapril, on cardiac and autonomic functions in diabetic rats. Diabetes was induced by streptozotocin (50 mg/kg), and rats were treated with enalapril (1 mg \u00b7 kg(-1) \u00b7 d(-1)). After 30 days, evaluations were performed in control, diabetic, and enalapril-treated groups. Cardiac function was evaluated by echocardiography and through cannulation of the left ventricle (at baseline and in response to volume overload). Heart rate and systolic blood pressure variabilities were evaluated in the time and frequency domains. Streptozotocin rats had left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunctions, expressed by reduced ejection fraction and increased isovolumic relaxation time. The ACEI prevented these changes, improved diastolic cardiac responses to volume overload and total power of heart rate variability, reduced the ACE1 activity and protein expression and cardiac angiotensin (Ang) II levels, and increased angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 activity, despite unchanged blood pressure. Correlations were obtained between Ang II content with systolic and diastolic functions and heart rate variability. These findings provide evidence that the low-dose ACEI prevents autonomic and cardiac dysfunctions induced by diabetes without changing blood pressure and associated with reduced cardiac Ang II and increased angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 activity.",

Twenty-two full papers were screened and 10 met the predefined inclusion criteria, involving 1036 participants who were mainly community dwelling older adults in their 8th decade. A wide range of gait variability parameters, testing protocols and calculations of gait variability were reported. Reliability estimates varied, but were mostly fair to moderate. Concurrent validity was established for stance time variability and change estimates were reported for stance time and swing time. Standard of reporting was generally poor, with insufficient detail provided for aspects of measurement and testing protocols. Further research is required to standardise testing procedures and establish reliability, responsiveness and validity for confident use of gait variability as a robust measure.",

Large randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials have shown that reducing BP pharmacologically is single-handedly the most effective way to reduce rates of death and disability in patients with diabetes, particularly associated cardiovascular risks. Often, combinations of 2 or more drugs (diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, \u03b2-blockers, angiotensin receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, spironolactone, etc) are required for pharmacotherapy to be effective, particularly for patients in whom BP is difficult to control.

In hypertensive hypercholesterolemic animals, repeated administration of simvastatin slightly but significantly decreased the systolic blood pressure, enhanced its progressive reductions induced by repeated administration of ramipril and corrected the compromised lipid profile. Concomitantly, repeated administration of simvastatin, ramipril or simvastatin in combination with ramipril to these animals, increased nitric oxide (NO) production and decreased the elevated serum malondialdehyde (MDA) and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels. The effects of combined treatment were greater than those of simvastatin or ramipril alone. In hypertensive hypercholesterolemic patients, repeated administration of ramipril decreased systolic and diastolic blood pressure, increased NO production, and decreased the elevated serum MDA and hs-CRP levels. Addition of simvastatin to ramipril therapy enhanced these effects and corrected the compromised lipid profile. Simvastatin but not ramipril inhibited the contractile responses of isolated aortic rings induced by angiotensin 11. l-arginine and acetylcholine enhanced, while l-NAME inhibited effects of simvastatin, and simvastatin in combination with ramipril on these contractile responses. These findings suggest that simvastatin exerts antihypertensive effect and enhances the antihypertensive effect of ramipril in hypertensive hypercholesterolemic animals and patients. In addition to its cholesterol-lowering effect, the ability of simvastatin to ameliorate endothelial dysfunction through increasing NO bioavailability and through suppression of oxidative stress and vascular inflammation and its ability to enhance the effect of ramipril on these parameters may play a pivotal role in these effects.",

The prevention of CIN is critical if long-term outcomes are to be optimized after percutaneous coronary intervention. The prevalence of CIN in patients receiving contrast varies markedly (from <1% to 50%), depending on the presence of well characterized risk factors, the most important of which are baseline chronic renal insufficiency and diabetes mellitus. Other risk factors include advanced age, anemia, left ventricular dysfunction, dehydration, hypotension, renal transplant, low serum albumin, concomitant use of nephrotoxins, and the volume of contrast agent. The pathophysiology of CIN is likely to be multifactorial, including direct cytotoxicity, apoptosis, disturbances in intrarenal hemodynamics, and immune mechanisms. Few strategies have been shown to be effective to prevent CIN beyond hydration, the goal of which is to establish brisk diuresis prior to contrast administration, and to avoid hypotension. New strategies of controlled hydration and diuresis are promising. Studies are mixed on whether prophylactic oral N-acetylcysteine reduces the incidence of CIN, although its use is generally recommended, given its low cost and favorable side effect profile.

After enzymatic hydrolysis, both antioxidant and ACE-inhibitory activities of camel whole casein and camel \u03b2-CN were enhanced. Camel whole casein and \u03b2-CN showed significant ACE-inhibitory activities after hydrolysis with pepsin alone and after pepsinolysis followed by trypsinolysis and chymotrypsinolysis. Camel \u03b2-CN showed high antioxidant activity after hydrolysis with chymotrypsin.

Transgenic (Tg) mice overexpressing kidney androgen-regulated protein (KAP) specifically in kidney showed hypertension associated with oxidative stress. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are strongly implicated in the pathological signaling leading to hypertension in a framework that includes renin-angiotensin system (RAS) activation, increased sympathetic activity, and cardiac remodeling. In this report, we observed that plasma levels of angiotensin II and catecholamines were increased in KAP Tg mice, compared with wild-type animals. Systemic administration of Tempol, a membrane-permeative superoxide dismutase mimetic, reduced arterial pressure as well as urinary excretion of oxidative stress markers and reduced both angiotensin II and norepinephrine plasma levels in KAP Tg mice. Intracerebroventricular administration of Tempol also reduced arterial pressure in Tg mice. Moreover, administration of apocynin and DPI, inhibitors of NADPH oxidase, a major source of ROS, also reduced arterial pressure and both angiotensin II and norepinephrine plasma levels in Tg mice. Thus, we analyzed the involvement of the RAS and sympathetic nervous system in KAP Tg mouse hypertension. Both captopril and losartan reduced arterial blood pressure in Tg mice, as also occurred after \u03b2-adrenergic blockade with atenolol. Also, intracerebroventricular losartan administration reduced arterial pressure in KAP Tg mice. Our data demonstrate that hypertension in male KAP Tg mice is based on increased oxidative stress, increased sympathetic activity, and RAS activation. Moreover, our results suggest a role for increased oxidative stress in the CNS as a major cause of hypertension in these animals.",

The phase solubility analysis indicated that the solubility of FOS in simulated gastric fluid was increased in the presence of CDs and revealed for RAMEB an A(L)-type diagram, suggesting the formation of a 1:1 inclusion complex, and for beta-CD a B(s)-type phase diagram. The estimated apparent stability constant (K1:1), according to the Higuchi and Connors method, is 3209.99 M(-1) and 1770.34 M(-1) for RAMEB and beta-CD complexes respectively. The binary systems FOS/CDs were prepared using the kneading method in the molar ratio 1:1. The PXRD patterns and the thermograms indicated a drug amorphization process, higher for FOS/RAMEB binary system and the FTIR analysis suggested that the ester group of FOS is probably enclosed in the CD's cavity. The results of this study confirm the formation of inclusion complexes both in solution and in solid state and suggest that the complexes formation between FOS and CDs could improve the bioavailability of the drug due to the enhancing absorption expected from increased drug solubility.",

Additive genetic factors accounted for 47.3% of variance in plasma APP activity in healthy individuals. Nested deletion analysis identified the minimal promoter (-338 bp to -147 bp) and an enhancer region (-2,502 bp to -2,238 bp). Three polymorphisms (c.-2399C>A, c.-1612G>T, and c.-393G>A) were significantly associated with plasma APP activity. Haplotype ATG was significantly associated with reduced reporter gene activity and with reduced plasma APP activity. The c.-2399C>A polymorphism was located in an enhancer region and was predicted to differentially bind hepatic nuclear factor 4 (HNF4). Over expression of HNF4 increased the activation of haplotype ATG compared with haplotype CGG. In a case control study of subjects with a history of ACEi-angioedema, haplotype ATG was significantly associated with ACEi-angioedema (OR 4.87 [1.78-13.35] P = 0.002). The ATG haplotype is functional and contributes to ACEi-angioedema through a reduction in APP.", 
    "763": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global health problem associated with considerable morbidity and mortality and despite advances in the treatment of end stage renal disease (ESRD) mechanisms to prevent and delay its progression are still being sought. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays a pivotal role in many of the pathophysiologic changes that lead to progression of renal disease. Traditionally RAAS was considered as an endocrine system and its principal role was to maintain blood pressure (BP). In recent years local RAAS has been described to operate independently from systemic and local angiotensin II (AngII) in the kidney to contribute in hypertension and kidney damage. The benefits of strict BP control in slowing kidney disease progression have been demonstrated in several clinical trials and the question whether specific agents like angiotensin converting enzyme antagonists (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) provide renoprotective benefits beyond BP lowering is to be answered. Several studies support these agents reduce proteinuria and protect renal function, whereas the opposite is stated by others. According to guidelines, their use is recommended as first line agents in diabetic renal disease and non diabetic renal disease with albuminuria, whereas there is no data to support the same in non diabetic nonalbuminuric renal disease. Dual blockage of RAAS with the combination of ACEIs and ARBs could offer an alternative in strict RAAS blockade, but studies up to now can not prove its safety and the combination is not recommended until ongoing trials will provide new and unarguable results.",

The major strains were found to include Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus pentosus, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, and Pediococcus pentosaceus in an investigation of the lactic acid bacteria. We searched for the functional components, and nicotianamine (NA) and 2\u2033-hydroxynicotianamine (HNA) were identified as angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. NA and HNA increased during fermentation. Indole-3-ethanol was identified as an antioxidant (a SOD active substance), and may have been generated from tryptophan during fermentation because it was not contained in green buckwheat juice. A safety test demonstrated that FBS contained were safe functional food components, showing negative results in buckwheat allergy tests. Any buckwheat allergy substances might have been degraded during the fermentation process.", 
    "765": "The Perindopril Protection Against Recurrent Stroke Study (PROGRESS) was a randomized placebo-controlled trial which clearly demonstrated that perindopril-based blood pressure (BP)-lowering treatment is one of the most effective and generalizable strategies for secondary prevention of stroke. Beneficial effects of BP lowering were observed on recurrent stroke, other cardiovascular events, disability, dependency, and cognitive function across a variety of subgroups defined by age, sex, geographical region, body mass index, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, and baseline BP levels. Once patients with stroke have stabilized, all patients should receive BP-lowering therapy irrespective of their BP levels. On the basis of recommendations from current international guidelines, BP should be lowered to <140/90 mm Hg in all patients with cerebrovascular disease and to <130/80 mm Hg if therapy is well tolerated.", 
    "766": "KEY POINTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: \u2022 \u2002In addition to hypertension, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are indicated for treatment of patients at high risk for coronary artery disease, after myocardial infarction, with dilated cardiomypathy, or with chronic kidney disease. \u2022 \u2002The most familiar angiotensin-converting enzyme subtype, angiotensin-converting enzyme-1 (kininase II), cleaves the vasoconstrictor octapeptide angiotensin II from its inactive decapeptide precursor, angiotensin I, while simultaneously inactivating the vasodilator bradykinin. \u2022 \u2002Biochemical pathways within and around the renin-angiotensin system are highly species-specific; there is little evidence that \"angiotensin-converting enzyme bypass pathways\" have major clinical implications in humans. \u2022 \u2002Dietary sodium loading can diminish or abolish the antihypertensive effect of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, while salt restriction or concomitant diuretic therapy enhances it. \u2022 \u2002Dose-response curves with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are quite flat but their peak effects vary in different individuals. \u2022 \u2002Increased serum creatinine (decreased glomerular filtration rate) during acute or chronic angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition identifies individuals likely to experience long-term renal protective benefits. \u2022 \u2002Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are contraindicated in pregnancy due to fetal toxicity. \u2022 \u2002Use of angiotensin-converting enzymes can be limited by idiosyncratic reactions (cough or angioedema), hyperkalemia (usually in cardiac or renal failure or with combined renin-angiotensin blockade) or hypotension (usually with severe volume-depletion or cardiac failure).", 
    "767": "KEY POINTS AND PRACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS: \u2022 \u2002Aliskiren, the sole oral renin inhibitor approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, either as monotherapy or in combination, with reductions in blood pressure similar to other agents. \u2022 \u2002Early evidence suggests that aliskiren confers additional benefit in patients with diabetic nephropathy. Data are not yet available to determine whether protection will extend to cardiovascular disease. \u2022 \u2002No initial dosage adjustment is required in elderly patients or for patients with mild to severe renal impairment; however, clinical experience is limited in patients with significant renal impairment, and with renal artery stenosis. \u2022 \u2002It appears rational to combine aliskiren with agents that otherwise increase plasma renin activity, including thiazide diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers. \u2022 \u2002While there is a reactive rise in renin in response to aliskiren, probably larger than that induced by angiotensin receptor blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, there is no evidence that this rise is harmful. \u2022 \u2002In placebo-controlled studies, the incidence of edema anywhere in the body was 0.4% with aliskiren compared with 0.5% with placebo. It is unknown whether angioedema rates are higher in blacks with aliskiren. \u2022 \u2002Aliskiren is associated with a slight increase in cough, with rates of about one third to one half seen with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. \u2022 \u2002Increases in serum potassium >5.5\u2003meq/L were infrequent in patients with essential hypertension treated with aliskiren alone (0.9% compared with 0.6% with placebo).", 
    "768": "KEY POINTS AND PRACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS: \u2022 \u2002Mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonists (aldosterone blockers) provide effective antihypertensive treatment, especially in low-renin and salt-sensitive forms of hypertension, including resistant hypertension. \u2022 \u2002Newer, more selective MR antagonists (eg, eplerenone) have fewer of the progestational and antiandrogenic effects than spironolactone, enhancing tolerability and potentially improving adherence to therapy. \u2022 \u2002MR antagonists provide an additional benefit in the treatment of heart failure when combined with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, digoxin, and loop diuretics. \u2022 \u2002Other potassium-sparing diuretics (amiloride or triamterene) are generally prescribed for essential hypertension as a fixed-dose combination with hydrochlorothiazide. \u2022 \u2002The dose range for spironolactone with resistant hypertension is between 25 mg/d and 50 mg/d, and eplerenone is an appropriate alternative if spironolactone is not tolerated because of sexual side effects. \u2022 \u2002In general, the combined use of spironolactone and adequate doses of a thiazide diuretic or a thiazide-like agent such as chlorthalidone for the treatment of resistant hypertension maximizes efficacy and reduces the risk of spironolactone-induced hyperkalemia.", 
    "769": "KEY POINTS AND PRACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS: \u2022 \u2002Although chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide are structurally similar, they are very different pharmacokinetically, with chlorthalidone having both an extremely long half-life (approximately 40 to 60 hours) and a large volume of distribution, with gradual elimination from the plasma compartment by tubular secretion. \u2022 \u2002Furosemide usage, the most widely used diuretic in the loop diuretic class, can be complicated by extremely erratic absorption, with a bioavailability range of 12% to 112%. \u2022 \u2002Chlorthalidone, at a dose of 25 mg, is comparatively more potent than 50 mg of hydrochlorothiazide, particularly as related to overnight blood pressure reduction. \u2022 \u2002In ALLHAT, there was no difference among chlorthalidone, amlodipine, lisinopril, and doxazosin for the primary outcome or mortality. \u2022 \u2002Secondary outcomes were similar except for a 38% higher rate of heart failure with amlodipine; a 10% higher rate of combined cardiovascular disease, a 15% higher rate of stroke, and a 19% higher rate of heart failure with lisinopril; and a 20% higher rate of cardiovascular disease, a 20% higher rate of stroke (40% higher rate in blacks), and an 80% higher rate of heart failure with doxazosin, compared with chlorthalidone. \u2022 \u2002The ACCOMPLISH study may affect future practice guidelines as a result of its findings favoring the amlodipine/benazepril combination; however, the generalizability to patient populations with a lesser cardiovascular risk profile remains in question and the dose of hydrochlorothiazide was only 12.5 mg to 25 mg daily, which was a dose lower than that used in placebo-controlled trials using hydrochlorothiazide. \u2022 \u2002Certain low-renin patient groups (eg, blacks, the elderly, and diabetics) as well as those who manifest the metabolic syndrome are commonly more responsive to thiazide-type diuretic therapy. \u2022 \u2002Diuretics can be successfully combined with \u03b2-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, centrally acting agents, and even calcium channel blockers. \u2022 \u2002Although thiazide-type diuretics are among the best-tolerated antihypertensive agents in terms of symptomatic adverse effects, diuretic-related adverse side effects include those with established mechanisms (eg, such as electrolyte changes and/or metabolic abnormalities) and other side effects, which are less well understood mechanistically (eg, impotence), although the latter is not universally accepted as a diuretic-related side effect. \u2022 \u2002Thiazide-induced hypokalemia is associated with increased blood glucose, and treatment of thiazide-induced hypokalemia may reverse glucose intolerance and possibly prevent diabetes. \u2022 \u2002Thiazide-induced hyperuricemia occurs as a result of volume contraction and competition with uric acid for renal tubular secretion, but does not necessarily contraindicate using a thiazide, especially if a uric acid-lowering drug such as allopurinol is being used. \u2022 \u2002Adverse interactions include the blunting of thiazide effects by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and the potential to increase fatigue, lethargy, and increase in glucose when combined with \u03b2-blockers. \u2022 \u2002Thiazide-type diuretics are useful first-line agents in the treatment of hypertension because they have been proven to reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in systolic and diastolic forms of hypertension and do so at low cost. \u2022 \u2002Loop diuretics should not be used as first-line therapy in hypertension since there are no outcome data with them. They should be reserved for conditions of clinically significant fluid overload (eg, heart failure and significant fluid retention with vasodilator drugs, such as minoxidil) or with advanced renal failure and can be combined with thiazide-type diuretics.", 
    "770": "The incidence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasing worldwide. Cardiovascular disease is strongly associated with CKD and constitutes one of its major causes of morbidity and mortality. Although current treatments for CKD focus on blood pressure and proteinuria reduction, many CKD patients have ongoing hypertension and residual proteinuria. Newer treatments are needed that not only act on these parameters, but also slow the progression of CKD and improve the cardiovascular risk profile of CKD patients. The endothelins (ETs) are a family of related peptides of which ET-1 is the most powerful endogenous vasoconstrictor and the predominant isoform in the cardiovascular and renal systems. The ET system has been widely implicated in both cardiovascular disease and CKD. ET-1 contributes to the pathogenesis and maintenance of hypertension and arterial stiffness, as well endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis. By reversal of these effects, ET antagonists may reduce cardiovascular risk. In CKD patients, antagonism of the ET system may be of benefit in improving renal hemodynamics and reducing proteinuria. ET is likely also involved in the progression of renal disease, and data are emerging that suggest a synergistic role for ET receptor antagonists with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in slowing CKD progression.", 
    "771": "Today diabetic nephropathy is the leading course of end-stage renal disease; the incidence and prevalence of diabetic renal disease is still continuing to increase, particularly in the Western world. Despite improvements in diagnosis and treatment of diabetic nephropathy, only partial renal protection is reached with the current standard therapy regiments, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin receptor blockers. Against this background, it is of particular importance to learn more about the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy and to find new therapeutic approaches which alone or in combination with standard therapy have the potential to prevent or delay the progression of diabetic nephropathy, thus improving kidney and patient survival. Among others, endothelin (ET) receptor blockers have emerged as a potential therapeutic option that operates on the basis of physiological and pathophysiological effects of endothelin. Of note, the ET system was shown to be involved in hypertension and kidney disease, particularly proteinuric nephropathies, and there is good experimental data indicating a specific role of ET in the pathogenesis and progression of diabetic nephropathy. ET receptor blockers have been shown to be nephroprotective in animal models of type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus with the effects partly independent of blood pressure lowering. In patients with hypertension and diabetic nephropathies, the data is controversial and depends on the stage of the disease and the drug used. It was only recently that a large international clinical study (ASCEND) provided evidence for beneficial effects of ET antagonist treatment, i.e. reduction in proteinuria. Due to the premature termination of the study, however, hard endpoints like death could no longer be assessed. Another very recent randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of subjects with diabetic nephropathy also provided evidence for a specific antiproteinuric effect of the ET receptor antagonist atrasentan on top of an already existing blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. Thus, it appears currently of great scientific and clinical interest to shed some light on the role of the ET system and its blockade in diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "772": "Biomarkers are being increasingly used in the study of cardiovascular disease because they provide readily quantifiable surrogate endpoints and allow accurate assessment of the effects of therapy on particular pathological processes. However, in order to be useful, biomarkers must be relevant, predictable, accurate, and reproducible. There is compelling evidence from large-scale clinical trials that inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system [angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin type II receptor blockers (ARBs)] and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) may have beneficial effects beyond blood pressure control in the treatment of hypertension. Biomarkers are expected to provide further insight into these beneficial effects and allow for quantitative assessment. This review summarizes the published clinical evidence on the effects of various antihypertensive drugs, particularly ARBs (e.g. losartan and olmesartan medoxomil) and CCBs (e.g. amlodipine), alone and in combination with other agents (e.g. hydrochlorothiazide), on central aortic pressure and the biomarkers high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), adiponectin, cystatin C, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), procollagen, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, and interleukin-6. Of these biomarkers, the benefits of antihypertensive therapy on hsCRP, adiponectin, and HOMA-IR reflect a potential for quantifiable long-term vascular benefits.",

According to the current standard for monitoring cardiac function, cardiotoxicity is usually detected only when a functional impairment has already occurred, precluding any chance of preventing its development. Over the last decade, however, a new approach, based on the use of cardiac biomarkers, has emerged, and has proven to be an effective alternative strategy for early detection of subclinical cardiac injury. In particular, the role of troponin I in identifying patients at risk of cardiotoxicity and of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in preventing left ventricular ejection fraction reduction and late cardiac events represent an effective tool for the prevention of this complication.",

We report a 6-year-old girl who developed nephrotic-range proteinuria following diagnosis of a Sertoli-Leydig ovarian tumor. A renal biopsy was performed, which led to the diagnosis of MN. The patient maintained normal renal function and gradually showed improvement in proteinuria over several months without the use of corticosteroids or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Our case highlights the importance of performing screening urinalyses in children with tumors to recognize the presence of clinically significant, but potentially asymptomatic kidney disease.",

At the time of renal biopsy, the median age of IgAN pts was 32.3 (18-90) years, the median level of serum creatinine was 119 \u03bcmol/L and the median level of proteinuria was 1.8 g/day. Most of the pts were found to have arterial hypertension (56.7%). The majority of the pts with arterial hypertension were treated with inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (80.4%) and the remaining pts (42.6%) were treated with angiotensin II receptor blockers. Fifty per cent of the pts (170 pts) were treated of corticosteroids, 21% of the pts (71 pts) used a combined immunosuppressive treatment of corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide, 8% of the pts (27 pts) took azathioprine, 1.5% of the pts (5 pts) took cyclosporine and 1.5% of the pts (5 pts) were given mycophenolate mofetil. Hypertension at presentation, fibrointimal proliferation of arterial vessels, interstitial fibrosis and interstitial inflammation were shown to be associated with \u226550% increase of plasma creatinine level from baseline in univariate analysis (P<0.05 for hypertension and fibrointimal proliferation; P<0.01 for interstitial fibrosis and inflammation). Using stepwise logistic regression presenting proteinuria>2 g/day [odds ratio (OR)=2.24, P<0.01], tubular atrophy (OR=4.97, P<0.01) and damage of tubular epithelium (OR=1.78, P<0.05) were found as risk factors for \u226550% increase of plasma creatinine level from baseline.",

In the present studies, we examined the influence of modulating nitric oxide availability on perfusion-contraction matching after recurrent no-flow ischaemia in acute open-chest, anaesthetized dogs. The following three groups were studied: (1) saline; (2) L-NAME (10 mg kg(-1) I.V.); and (3) enalaprilat (1.5 mg kg(-1) I.V.). Regional myocardial blood flow was measured with microspheres and contractile function with piezoelectric crystals to determine systolic wall thickening. Dogs underwent four cycles of 5 min acute ischaemia and 5 min coronary reperfusion; area at risk was similar for all groups. In all dogs, ischaemic zone contractile function was depressed after recurrent no-flow ischaemia despite increased myocardial blood flow during reperfusion; contractile function was further depressed during L-NAME and was partly restored with enalaprilat. Within the ischaemic region, blood flow in subendocardial and subepicardial layers increased significantly compared with baseline during each reperfusion period independently of treatment. Our findings suggest that reduced NO availability can significantly impair myocardial perfusion-contraction matching, which is partly restored by administration of an NO donor.", 
    "780": "Nitric oxide (NO), the smallest signalling molecule known, is produced by three isoforms of NO synthase (NOS; EC 1.14.13.39). They all utilize l-arginine and molecular oxygen as substrates and require the cofactors reduced nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), flavin mononucleotide (FMN), and (6R-)5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4)). All NOS bind calmodulin and contain haem. Neuronal NOS (nNOS, NOS I) is constitutively expressed in central and peripheral neurons and some other cell types. Its functions include synaptic plasticity in the central nervous system (CNS), central regulation of blood pressure, smooth muscle relaxation, and vasodilatation via peripheral nitrergic nerves. Nitrergic nerves are of particular importance in the relaxation of corpus cavernosum and penile erection. Phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil) require at least a residual nNOS activity for their action. Inducible NOS (NOS II) can be expressed in many cell types in response to lipopolysaccharide, cytokines, or other agents. Inducible NOS generates large amounts of NO that have cytostatic effects on parasitic target cells. Inducible NOS contributes to the pathophysiology of inflammatory diseases and septic shock. Endothelial NOS (eNOS, NOS III) is mostly expressed in endothelial cells. It keeps blood vessels dilated, controls blood pressure, and has numerous other vasoprotective and anti-atherosclerotic effects. Many cardiovascular risk factors lead to oxidative stress, eNOS uncoupling, and endothelial dysfunction in the vasculature. Pharmacologically, vascular oxidative stress can be reduced and eNOS functionality restored with renin- and angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitors, with angiotensin receptor blockers, and with statins.",

Of the 8,049 hospitalized HF patients aged \u2265 65 years discharged alive from 106 Alabama hospitals, 4,044 received discharge prescriptions of either ACE inhibitors (n = 3,383) or ARBs (n = 661). Propensity scores for ARB use, calculated for each of 4,044 patients, were used to match 655 (99% of 661) patients receiving ARBs with 661 patients receiving ACE inhibitors. The assembled cohort of 655 pairs of patients was well balanced on 56 baseline characteristics. During >8 years of follow-up, all-cause mortality occurred in 63% and 68% of matched patients receiving ARBs and ACE inhibitors, respectively (hazard ratio [HR] associated with ARB use 0.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.75 to 0.99, p = 0.031). Among the 956 matched patients with data on the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), the association between ARB (vs ACE inhibitor) use was significant in only 419 patients with LVEFs \u2265 45% (HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.84, p = 0.001) but not in the 537 patients with LVEFs < 45% (HR 1.00, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.23, p = 0.999; p for interaction = 0.012).

    "782": "In chronic kidney disease patients, inexorable renal function decline is reduced by renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers. ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers decrease blood pressure and proteinuria. Guidelines recommend a reduction of blood pressure to less than 130/80 mmHg and urinary protein excretion below 0.5 g/d. The combined use of a diuretic increases anti-proteinuric effect and blood pressure control of RAS blockers. Drugs as mineralo-corticocoids receptor antagonist and endothelin receptor antagonists reduce further albuminuria in combination with RAS blocker, but side effects need to be precised. Both metabolic acidosis and hyperuricemia represent new therapeutic goals to slow renal function decline in CKD patients. Renal fibrosis treatment and regenerative medicine are stemming and will be important issues for kidney and other organs in the future.", 
    "783": "The aim of this experiment was to investigate whether nebivolol and zofenopril have protective effects against oxidative damage and apoptosis induced by cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). There were seven groups of rats, with each containing eight rats. The groups were: the control group, I/R group, I/R plus zofenopril, I/R plus nebivolol, I/R plus nebivolol and zofenopril, zofenopril only and nebivolol only. Cerebral I/R was induced by clamping the bilateral common carotid artery and through hypotension. The rats were sacrificed 1h after ischemia, and histopathological and biochemical analyses were carried out on their brains. The total antioxidant capacity was evaluated by using an automated and colorimetric measurement method developed by Erel. I/R produced a significant increase in the levels of total oxidant status and malondialdehyde levels, the number of caspase-3 immunopositive cells and activities of prolidase and paraoxonase in brain when compared with the control group (p<0.05). A significant decrease in brain total antioxidant capacity and nitric oxide levels were found in I/R group when compared with the control group (p<0.05). Both nebivolol and zofenopril treatment prevented decreasing of the total antioxidant capacity and nitric oxide levels, produced by I/R in the brain (p<0.05). Both nebivolol and zofenopril treatment prevented the total oxidant status, malondialdehyde levels, activities of paraoxonase and prolidase from increasing in brains of rats exposed to I/R (p<0.05). In conclusion, both nebivolol and zofenopril protected rats from ischemia-induced brain injury. The protection may be due to the indirect prevention of oxidative stress and apoptosis.",

Nevertheless, it is a common practice in many centers to prescribe ACE inhibitors before coronary angiography. The most likely mechanisms leading to CIN are medullary hypoxia due to decreased renal blood flow (RBF) secondary to renal artery vasoconstriction and direct tubular toxicity by contrast medium (CM). Furthermore, experimental data suggest that an activated renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, increased endothelin-1, and reactive oxygen species play a role in the pathogenesis of CIN and these can be inhibited by using ACE inhibitors.

This includes reviewing the pathophysiology of how these agents affect potassium handling within the kidney, risk factors for developing hyperkalemia, incidence, clinical signs and symptoms, and providing a practical approach to treatment of the patient who is either at risk of, or experiencing, hyperkalemia. ACEi and ARB are effective therapeutic agents used in a variety of clinical scenarios. However, related to their effects on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, their use can be associated with hyperkalemia, particularly in patients who have chronic renal insufficiency. Published incidence estimates of hyperkalemia associated with ACEi or ARB vary, but up to 10% of patients may experience at least mild hyperkalemia. Important considerations when initiating ACEi or ARB therapy include obtaining an estimate of glomerular filtration rate and a baseline serum potassium concentration, as well as assessing whether the patient has excessive potassium intake from diet, supplements, or drugs that can also increase serum potassium. Serum potassium monitoring shortly after initiation of therapy can assist in preventing hyperkalemia. If hyperkalemia does develop, prompt recognition of cardiac dysrhythmias and effective treatment to antagonize the cardiac effects of potassium, redistribute potassium into cells, and remove excess potassium from the body is important.Understanding the mechanism of action of ACEi and ARB coupled with judicious drug use and clinical vigilance can minimize the risk to the patient of developing hyperkalemia. Should hyperkalemia occur, prompt recognition and management can optimize clinical outcome.",

The sodium intake, however, could be problematic in patients with reduced GFR. As alkali-induced dietary protein decreased kidney injury in animals, we compared the efficacy of alkali-inducing fruits and vegetables with oral sodium bicarbonate to diminish kidney injury in patients with hypertensive nephropathy at stage 1 or 2 estimated GFR. All patients were evaluated 30 days after no intervention; daily oral sodium bicarbonate; or fruits and vegetables in amounts calculated to reduce dietary acid by half. All patients had 6 months of antihypertensive control by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition before and during these studies, and otherwise ate ad lib. Indices of kidney injury were not changed in the stage 1 group. By contrast, each treatment of stage 2 patients decreased urinary albumin, N-acetyl \u03b2-D-glucosaminidase, and transforming growth factor \u03b2 from the controls to a similar extent. Thus, a reduction in dietary acid decreased kidney injury in patients with moderately reduced eGFR due to hypertensive nephropathy and that with fruits and vegetables was comparable to sodium bicarbonate. Fruits and vegetables appear to be an effective kidney protective adjunct to blood pressure reduction and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition in hypertensive and possibly other nephropathies.",

Ramipril significantly modulated the expression of other diurnally regulated genes, such as aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like (ARNTL), encoding aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like, a core component of the circadian clock (P=0.02). Concomitant attenuation of NR1D1 downregulation (-2.4-fold compared with -4.1-fold in placebo; P=0.04), a transcriptional repressor of ARNTL, supported the view that ramipril might modulate glucose homeostasis pathways involving the NR1D1 ARNTL axis.",

Whereas recombinant human ACE2 is readily detected in mouse tissues using 1 \u03bcM DX600 at pH 7.5, the endogenous ACE2 activity in mouse tissues is barely detectable. We compared human, mouse, and rat ACE2 overexpressed in cell lines for their sensitivity to inhibition by DX600. ACE2 from all three species could be inhibited by DX600, but the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) for human ACE2 was much lower (78-fold) than for rodent ACE2. Following optimization of pH, substrate concentration, and antagonist concentration, rat and mouse ACE2 expressed in a cell line could be accurately quantified with 10 \u03bcM DX600 (>95% inhibition) but not with 1 \u03bcM DX600 (<75% inhibition). Validation that the optimized method robustly quantifies ACE2 in mouse tissues (kidney, brain, heart, and plasma) was performed using wild-type and ACE2 knockout mice.

Ang II also contributes to oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis in pancreatic \u03b2 cells. Aldosterone diminishes glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in vivo and in vitro from isolated pancreatic islets and cultured \u03b2 cells through a mineralocorticoid receptor (MR)-independent mechanism.

The study cohort consisted of patients hospitalized in 2007 with an ACS including 4,445 from the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) and 6,706 from the Gulf Registry of Acute Coronary Events (Gulf RACE). Average age of patients in Gulf RACE was nearly a decade younger than that in GRACE (56 vs 66 years). Patients in Gulf RACE were more likely to be men, diabetic, and smoke and less likely to be hypertensive compared to patients in GRACE. Patients in Gulf RACE had higher odds of receiving aspirin and a lower likelihood of receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, \u03b2 blockers, and clopidogrel during their index hospitalization. Although most eligible patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction in Gulf RACE received thrombolytics, most of their counterparts in GRACE underwent a primary percutaneous coronary intervention. Multivariable adjusted in-hospital case-fatality rates were not significantly different between patients in Gulf RACE and those in GRACE. In conclusion, despite differences in patient characteristics and treatment practices, short-term mortality rates were comparable in patients with ACS enrolled in these 2 registries.

    "838": "The aim of study was to evaluate the effect of commonly used lisinopril, rosuvastatin and their combined action on site-specific nephrotoxicity in rats using clusterin and microalbumin nephrotoxic biomarkers and other related parameters using oral gavage. Rosuvastatin at 2 different doses showed increase in urinary microalbumin levels whereas lisinopril and its combination with rosuvastatin at 2 different doses did not show urinary microalbumin excretion indicating beneficial effects of lisinopril in terms of reducing microalbumin. Urinary clusterin levels significantly increased in high-dose treated animals of lisinopril and rosuvastatin. The use of lisinopril plus rosuvastatin at low dose also led to worsened renal function by raising urinary clusterin levels (217 \u00b1 4.6 ng/ml) when compared with the control (143 \u00b1 3.3 ng/ml). Renal histopathology showed multifocal regeneration of tubules indicating proximal tubule damaged. These results indicate that lisinopril (50 mg/kg), rosuvastatin (100 mg/kg), lisinopril+rosuvastatin (20+40 mg/kg) and lisinopril+rosuvastatin (50+100 mg/kg) showed toxicity only on proximal tubules.",

Since neovascularization plays an important role in hepatocarcinogenesis and IR, an angiostatic therapy may be considered as one of the promising approaches for chemoprevention against HCC. The aim of the current study was to examine the combination effect of a clinically used branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I), both reportedly possess anti-angiogenic and IR-improving activities, on the cumulative recurrence after curative therapy. BCAA granules (Livact; 12 g/day) and/or ACE-I (perindopril; 4 mg/day) were administered after the curative therapy for HCC, and several indices were analyzed. A 48-month follow-up revealed that the combination treatment with BCAA and ACE-I markedly inhibited the cumulative recurrence of HCC under IR conditions, whereas neither single treatment exerted a significant inhibition. The soluble form of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF; a central angiogenic factor) receptor-2 (sVEGFR2) was significantly decreased only three months after the treatment without recurrence. We also observed that IR, determined by the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR), was significantly improved by this regimen, indicating that an inhibitory effect was achieved, at least partly, by coordinated effects of anti-angiogenesis and IR improvement. In conclusion, since both BCAA and ACE-I are widely used in clinical practice with safety, this combination therapy may represent a potential new strategy for chemoprevention against IR-based HCC recurrence in the future. Moreover, sVEGFR2 may become a useful clinical predictive marker of this combination treatment.",

We investigated the effects of this classification on all-cause mortality in 1,285 patients from the Evaluation of the Methods and Management of Acute Coronary Events (EMMACE)-2 registry. There were 528 deaths (6.6-year all-cause mortality 41.1%). Survival was greatest in the cTnI \u2264 0.06-\u03bcg/L subgroup at 30 days (p = 0.005), 6 months (p = 0.015), 1 year (p = 0.002), and 6.6 years (p = 0.045). After adjustment there was no significant difference in survival between the cTnI >0.06- to < 0.5-\u03bcg/L and \u2265 0.5-\u03bcg/L subgroups. Increased mortality (hazard ratio, 95% confidence interval) was associated with ages 70 to 80 years (2.58, 1.17 to 3.91) and >80 years (3.30, 3.50 to 5.06), peripheral vascular disease (1.50, 1.16 to 1.94), heart failure (1.36, 1.05 to 1.83), diabetes mellitus (1.68, 1.36 to 2.07), severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction (1.50, 1.00 to 2.21), and creatinine per 10 \u03bcmol/L (1.65, 1.02 to 1.08), whereas ages 50 to 60 years (0.55, 0.32 to 0.96), \u03b2 blockers (0.53, 0.44 to 0.64), aspirin (0.80 0.65 to 0.99), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (0.67, 0.56 to 0.80), statins (0.73, 0.59 to 0.90), and revascularization (0.33, 0.12 to 0.92) were associated with a lower risk of death. In conclusion, although quantitative evaluation of cTnI concentration in patients with acute coronary syndrome with cTnI > 0.06 \u03bcg/L was associated with no added prognostic information, the dichotomization of patients by cTnI status (\"positive\" and \"negative\") facilitates acute coronary syndrome risk stratification.",

The conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is a key process in the RAAS because angiotensin II causes the vasoconstriction association with hypertension. Because of its effectiveness as an ACE blocker, quinipril is widely used for clinical treatment of hypertension and chronic congestive heart failure(.) Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization coupled with time-of-flight analyzer (MALDI-TOF) is a high throughput instrument for biological sample analysis. This study developed a micro-scale approach for using MALDI-TOF to detect quinapril in biological samples. A micro-liquid-liquid-extraction strategy combined with ion-pair interaction successfully extracted quinapril from aqueous layer to organic layer. Quinolones were then used as matrix additives to suppress undesired substances in plasma produce signals. Several factors affecting extraction efficiency were investigated in a biosample with a volume of only 10 \u03bcL. This method is successful to monitor quinapril in the clinical therapeutic range. The proposed method proved effective for monitoring the trace amounts of quinapril typically used for clinical therapy. The relative standard deviation (R.S.D.) and relative error (R.E.) used for evaluating within- and between-day assays of quinapril in plasma consistently remained below 15%.", 
    "872": "The effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition on function and structure of the aorta was studied in the Lewis polycystic kidney (LPK) rat model of cystic renal disease and Lewis controls. Pulse-wave velocity (PWV) was recorded under urethane anesthesia (1.3 g/kg ip) in mixed-sex animals aged 6 and 12 wk and in 12-wk-old animals treated with perindopril (3 mg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7day(-1) po) from age 6-12 wk. Tail-cuff systolic pressures were recorded over the treatment period. After PWV measurements, animals were euthanized and the aorta was removed for histomorphological and calcium analysis. Hypertension in LPK at 6 and 12 wk was associated with a shift of the PWV curve upward and to the right, indicating a decrease in aortic compliance, which was significantly reduced by perindopril. LPK demonstrated greater aortic calcification (6 wk: 123 \u00b1 19 vs. 65 \u00b1 7 and 12 wk: 406 \u00b1 6 vs. 67 \u00b1 6 \u03bcmol/g, P < 0.001, LPK vs. Lewis, respectively). This was reduced by treatment with perindopril (172 \u00b1 48 \u03bcmol/g, 12 wk LPK P < 0.001). Medial cross-sectional area and elastic modulus/wall stress of the aorta were greater in LPK vs. Lewis control animals at 6 and 12 wk of age and showed an age-related increase that was prevented by treatment with perindopril (P < 0.001). Perindopril also ameliorated the degradation of elastin, increase in collagen content, and medial elastocalcinosis seen in 12-wk LPK. Overall, perindopril improved the structural and functional indices of aortic stiffness in the LPK rats, demonstrating a capacity for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition to limit vascular remodeling in chronic kidney disease.",

    "877": "Bradykinin (BK) is a vasoactive nonapeptide cleaved from circulating kininogens and that is degraded by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). It has been reported that the PR3 protease from human neutrophil releases an alternate peptide of 13 amino acids, Met-Lys-BK-Ser-Ser, from high molecular weight kininogen. We have studied vascular actions of this kinin. Its affinity for recombinant B\u2081 and B\u2082 receptors is very low, as assessed by the binding competition of [\u00b3H]Lys-des-Arg\u2079-BK and [\u00b3H]BK, respectively, but Met-Lys-BK-Ser-Ser effectively displaced a fraction of [\u00b3H]enalaprilat binding to recombinant ACE. Mutant recombinant ACE constructions revealed that affinity gap between BK and Met-Lys-BK-Ser-Ser is larger for the N-terminal catalytic site than for the C-terminal one, based on competition for the substrate Abz-Phe-Arg-Lys(Dnp)-Pro-OH in an enzymatic assay. Met-Lys-BK-Ser-Ser is a low potency stimulant of the rabbit aorta (bioassay for B\u2081 receptors), but the human isolated umbilical vein, a contractile bioassay for the B\u2082 receptors, responded to Met-Lys-BK-Ser-Ser more than expected from the radioligand binding assay, this agonist being \u223c30-fold less potent than BK in the vein. Venous tissue treatment with the ACE inhibitor enalaprilat reduced the apparent potency of Met-Lys-BK-Ser-Ser by 15-fold, while not affecting that of BK. In the rabbit isolated jugular vein, Met-Lys-BK-Ser-Ser is nearly as potent as BK as a contractile stimulant of endogenous B\u2082 receptors (EC\u2085\u2080 values of 16.3 and 10.5 nM, respectively), but enalaprilat reduced the potency of Met-Lys-BK-Ser-Ser 13-fold while increasing that of BK 5.3-fold. In vascular tissue, ACE assumes a paradoxical activating role for Met-Lys-BK-Ser-Ser.", 
    "878": "Preclinical and clinical studies indicated involvement of renin angiotensin system (RAS) in memory functions. However, exact role of RAS in cognition is still ambiguous. Our aim was to explore how angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) modulates memory in experimental model of memory impairment. Memory deficit was induced by intracerebroventricular administration of streptozotocin (STZ, 3mg/kg) in rats. Perindopril, an ACE inhibitor, was given for 21 days and memory function was evaluated by Morris water maze test. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured by laser doppler flowmetry. The biochemical and expression studies were done in cortex and hippocampus of rat brain after the completion of behavioral studies. STZ caused impairment in memory along with significant reduction in CBF, ATP level and elevated oxidative and nitrosative stress. The activity and mRNA expression of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and ACE were also increased in rat brain regions following STZ administration. However, serum ACE activity remained unaffected. Treatment with perindopril dose dependently improved memory by increasing energy metabolism and CBF. Perindopril also decreased oxidative and nitrosative stress, activity and mRNA expression of AChE and ACE in STZ treated rat. Further, ACE inhibition mitigated STZ induced neurodegeneration as observed in histopathological studies. Moreover, perindopril per se improved memory and CBF, decreased oxidative stress with no effect on AChE activity and expression. However, perindopril per se significantly reduced ACE activity but increased mRNA expression of ACE in rat brain. These results suggest that ACE occupies a pivotal role in STZ induced memory deficit thus implicating central RAS in cognition.",

The study involved 32 patients with arterial hypertension, the initial serum total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides within the normal range. Patients of two groups, each of 16 subjects, were treated with lisinopril (10 mg/day) or with lisinopril (10 mg/day) plus simvastatin (20 mg/day).

In all patients, significantly higher catalase activity (by 79.3-106.5%, p < 0.0001) and significantly lower GPx activity (by 20.7-30.6%, p < 0.001) were observed after therapy as compared to the baselines. Just the same results were obtained in both groups (lisinopril and lisinopril + simvastatin), after both periods (3 and 6 month) of treatments. SOD activity was increased only in the lisinopril group and only after 6 months (p = 0.0345). No changes of GLR reductase activity were seen under all conditions indicated. Thus, the lisinopril monotherapy and combined lisinopril plus simvastatin therapy exhibit specific, pronounced and equipotent effects on antioxidant enzymes in human erythrocytes. Administration of lisinopril or lisinopril plus simvastatin may protect erythrocytes and other tissues from oxidative damage.", 
    "880": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are widely used for treatment of cardiovascular diseases. The effects of ACE inhibitors on the human bradykinin receptors were investigated. The mode of action of ACE inhibitors is considered. There is evidence that ACE inhibitors exert effects on the vascular system that cannot be attributed simply to the inhibition of ACE activity and accumulation of locally produced bradykinin. ACE inhibitors augment bradykinin effects on receptors indirectly by inducing cross-talk between ACE and the B2 receptor when enzyme and receptor molecules are sterically close, possibly forming a heterodimer. ACE inhibitors activate B1 receptors directly and independently of ACE via the zink-binding consensus sequence HEXXH, which is present in B1, but not in B2 receptor. Particular structure of B2 and B1 are represented, as well as receptor amino acids coupled with the G-proteins. Activation of kinin receptors by ACE inhibitors leads to clinically beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors.",

The purpose of this study was to compare hypotensive episodes in patients taking antihypertensive medications with normotensive patients during shoulder surgery in the beach chair position.", 
    "882": "Medical records of all patients undergoing shoulder arthroscopy during a 44-month period were reviewed retrospectively. The primary endpoint was the number of moderate hypotensive episodes (systolic blood pressure \u2264 85 mmHg) during the intraoperative period. Secondary endpoints included the frequency of vasopressor administration, total dose of vasopressors, and fluid administered. Values are expressed as mean (standard deviation).",

The antihypertensive medication group had more intraoperative hypotensive episodes [1.7 (2.2) vs 1.2 (1.8); P = 0.01] and vasopressor administrations. Total dose of vasopressors and volume of fluids administered were similar between groups. The timing of the administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and of angiotensin receptor antagonists (\u2264 10 hr vs > 10 hr before surgery) had no impact on intraoperative hypotension.",

Women accounted for 50% of the HF admissions and were older (mean age, 74\u00b114 versus 69\u00b114 years), more likely to have hypertension (77% versus 72%), and less likely to have coronary disease (44% versus 53%) or renal insufficiency (18% versus 23%) than men (all P<0.001). The presenting symptoms were similar to men, but women had higher admission systolic blood pressure (mean, 144\u00b131 versus 137\u00b130 mm Hg; P<0.001) and ejection fraction (mean, 0.44\u00b10.17% versus 0.34\u00b10.16%; P<0.001). After adjustment for baseline differences, eligible women were less likely than men to have measurement of left ventricular function (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.81; 95% CI, 0.76 to 0.86) and to receive anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation (adjusted OR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.86 to 0.96) or implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (adjusted OR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.65 to 0.75) but were as likely to receive discharge instructions, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, \u03b2-blockers, and smoking cessation counseling at discharge. Although the median length of stay was 4 days, women were more likely than men to be hospitalized >4 days (adjusted OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.10 to 1.16) and >7 days (adjusted OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.11).

    "888": "Obesity, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance/type 2 diabetes and hypertension are clustered in the metabolic syndrome representing critical risk factors for increased incidence cardio-cerebro-vascular diseases, kidney failure and cancer. Ectopic fat accumulation, i.e., accumulation in the mediastinum, liver and the abdomen, as well as generalized fat accumulation are associated with arterial hypertension, either systolic or diastolic. Several mechanisms including insulin resistance, sub-inflammatory state, increased Renin- Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS) system activity, oxidative stress, autonomic dysregulation as well as mechanical compression on the kidneys are all activated by obesity. Interestingly angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II (ATII) receptor blockers, while correcting arterial hypertension, also have a positive effect on glucose metabolism and diabetes prevention, in high risk patients. The implementation of dietary, medical and surgical strategies to prevent and treat obesity, are cornerstones for the primary prevention as well as treatment of arterial hypertension.", 
    "889": "The reaction of S-nitrosocaptopril (NOcap) formation was studied in both aqueous acid and basic medium. Captopril (cap) reacts rapidly with nitrous acid in strong acid medium to give the stable--in the timescale of the experiments--NOcap. The kinetic study of the reaction involving the use of stopped-flow, shows that at low sodium nitrite (nit) concentration, the reaction is first-order in both [nit], [H(+)], and is strongly catalysed by Cl(-) or Br(-) (= X(-)): rate = (k(3) + k(4)[X(-)])[H(+)][nit][cap]. In aqueous buffered solution of acetic acid-acetate the reaction rate is much slower and the decomposition of NOcap was observed; however, the rate of NOcap decay is more than 30-fold slower than its formation. In aqueous basic medium of carbonate-hydrogen carbonate buffer, as well as in alkaline medium, the kinetics of the nitroso group (NO) transfer from tert-butyl nitrite (tBN) to cap was studied using either conventional or stopped flow methods. In mild basic medium, the NOcap decomposes. The NOcap formation is first-order in both tBN and cap concentrations, and the reaction rate increases with pH until to, approximately, pH 11.5, above which value it becomes pH independent or even invariable with the [OH(-)]. Kinetic results show that the thiolate ion of cap is the reactive species. In fact, the presence of anionic micelles of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) inhibits the reaction due to the separation of the reagents; whereas, cationic micelles of tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide (TTABr) catalyse the reaction at low surfactant concentration due to reagents concentration in the small volume of the micelle. The rate equation is: rate = k(f) K(SH)[cap][tBN]/(K(SH) + [H(+)]). The rate of NOcap decomposition in mild basic medium is first-order in both [cap] and [NOcap], and decreases on increasing pH; but, in alkaline medium the NOcap is stable within the timescale of the experiments. Based on the results, the NOcap decomposition yields the disulfide compound that is formed in the nucleophilic attack of the -SH group of cap to the sulfur electrophilic center of NOcap, -S-N=O. The resulting rate equation is: rate = k(d)[H(+)][cap][NOcap]/(K(SH) + [H(+)]).",

This research explored the potential of regular tea consumption and influence of extraction time typically used in daily consumption of tea, as a therapeutic dietary support for potential management of early stage type 2 diabetes using in vitro assay models. Extraction times of 2 and 5 minutes were compared. The 5-minute extraction time had significantly higher total phenolic content compared with the 2-minute extraction time. Choice Darjeeling 5-minute extraction yielded the highest amount of total phenolics (299.6 \u00b1 5.9 mg/g), followed by Tazo Black 5-minute extraction (240 \u00b1 9.7 mg/g), whereas Bigelow Green 2-minute extraction had the lowest total phenolic content (53 \u00b1 8.2 mg/g). 1,1-Diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl scavenging-linked antioxidant activity was high (81-91%) for all types evaluated, and for most samples it was influenced by the extraction time. Similarly, high in vitro \u03b1-glucosidase inhibition was observed in almost all the samples assayed, and for most samples the 5-minute extraction had significantly higher inhibition compared with the 2-minute extraction time. The most fermented teas showed highest \u03b1-amylase inhibition: Choice Darjeeling 5-minute extraction had the highest inhibition (84.1%), followed by Tazo Black 5-minute extraction (71.6%). Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition was not observed in any sample. Overall, the 5-minute extraction time was found to have more relevance for potential benefits for managing hyperglycemia than the 2-minute procedure. This research suggests that tea offers an attractive potential strategy to regulate postprandial hyperglycemia toward an overall dietary support for type 2 diabetes management.",

The aim of this study was to assess doctors' opinions about the importance of the cardioprotective effects of ACE-Is beyond lowering blood pressure. The study participants (685 physicians) filled in a questionnaire testing doctors' knowledge of all of the therapeutic effects of ACE-Is not directly associated with lowering blood pressure and their clinical importance. In addition, each doctor filled in 20 questionnaires for subsequent patients treated with any ACE-I. Fifty-nine percent of the investigated physicians were aware of most of the therapeutic effects of ACE-Is. The most important therapeutic effects for the respondents were the following: reduction of peripheral resistance, inhibition of left ventricle hypertrophy, inhibition of vascular remodeling and atherosclerotic plaque stabilization. The most commonly prescribed ACE-Is were perindopril, lisinopril and chinalapril for inhibition of left ventricular hypertrophy and perindopril, ramipril and chinalapril for inhibition of arterial wall remodeling. The ACE-Is that were used to reduce peripheral vessel resistance included perindopril, lisinopril and trandolapril. Drugs used to stabilize the plaque included perindopril, lisinopril and cilazapril. The therapeutic effects of ACE-Is beyond lowering blood pressure were considered to be valid and important in daily clinical practice for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases and diabetic complications. The attribution of the effects of a particular ACE-I was not always in accordance with evidence-based medicine. The obtained treatment outcomes were attributed to the entire group of ACE-Is.", 
    "896": "The blood pressure lowering effect of a pea protein hydrolysate (PPH) that contained <3 kDa peptides, isolated by membrane ultrafiltration from the thermolysin digest of pea protein isolate (PPI), was examined using different rat models of hypertension as well as hypertensive human subjects. The PPH showed weak in vitro activities against renin and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) with inhibitory activities of 17 and 19%, respectively, at 1 mg/mL test concentration. Oral administration of the PPH to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) at doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg body weight led to a lowering of hourly systolic blood pressure (SBP), with a maximum reduction of 19 mmHg at 4 h. In contrast, orally administered unhydrolyzed PPI had no blood pressure reducing effect in SHR, suggesting that thermolysin hydrolysis may have been responsible for releasing bioactive peptides from the native protein. Oral administration of the PPH to the Han:SPRD-cy rat (a model of chronic kidney disease) over an 8-week period led to 29 and 25 mmHg reductions in SBP and diastolic blood pressure, respectively. The PPH-fed rats had lower plasma levels of angiotensin II, the major vasopressor involved in development of hypertension, but there was no effect on plasma activity or renal mRNA levels of ACE. However, renal expression of renin mRNA levels was reduced by approximately 50% in the PPH-fed rats, suggesting that reduced renin may be responsible for the reduced levels of angiotensin II. In a 3-week randomized double blind placebo-controlled crossover human intervention trial (7 volunteers), significant (p<0.05) reductions (over placebo) in SBP of 5 and 6 mmHg were obtained in the second and third weeks, respectively, for the PPH group. Therefore, thermolysin derived bioactive peptides from PPH reduced blood pressure in hypertensive rats and human subjects, likely via effects on the renal angiotensin system.",

Here we evaluated the relationships between baseline serum phosphate levels, disease progression, and response to ACE inhibition in 331 patients with proteinuric nephropathies in the prospective Ramipril Efficacy In Nephropathy (REIN) trial. Independent of treatment, patients with phosphate levels in the highest two quartiles progressed significantly faster either to ESRD or to a composite endpoint of doubling of serum creatinine or ESRD compared with patients with phosphate levels below the median (P < 0.001). Results were similar when we analyzed phosphate as a continuous variable (P \u2264 0.004). The renoprotective effect of ramipril decreased as serum phosphate increased (P \u2264 0.008 for interaction); this modification of the treatment effect by phosphate persisted despite adjusting for potential confounders such as GFR and urinary protein. In summary, these data suggest that phosphate is an independent risk factor for progression of renal disease among patients with proteinuric CKD, and high levels of phosphate may even attenuate the renoprotective effect of ACE inhibitors. Future trials should test whether reducing serum phosphate improves renal outcomes and optimizes the renoprotective effect of ACE inhibition.",

Gain-of-function mutations in TRPC6 cause hereditary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), and several human acquired proteinuric diseases show increased glomerular TRPC6 expression. Angiotensin II (AngII) is a key contributor to glomerular disease and may regulate TRPC6 expression in nonrenal cells. We demonstrate that AngII regulates TRPC6 mRNA and protein levels in cultured podocytes and that AngII infusion enhances glomerular TRPC6 expression in vivo. In animal models for human FSGS (doxorubicin nephropathy) and increased renin-angiotensin system activity (Ren2 transgenic rats), glomerular TRPC6 expression was increased in an AngII-dependent manner. TRPC6 expression correlated with glomerular damage markers and glomerulosclerosis. We show that the regulation of TRPC6 expression by AngII and doxorubicin requires TRPC6-mediated Ca(2+) influx and the activation of the Ca(2+)-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin and its substrate nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT). Accordingly, calcineurin inhibition by cyclosporine decreased TRPC6 expression and reduced proteinuria in doxorubicin nephropathy, whereas podocyte-specific inducible expression of a constitutively active NFAT mutant increased TRPC6 expression and induced severe proteinuria. Our findings demonstrate that the deleterious effects of AngII on podocytes and its pathogenic role in glomerular disease involve enhanced TRPC6 expression via a calcineurin/NFAT positive feedback signaling pathway.",

    "923": "We undertook a retrospective study of renal transplant biopsies between 2006 and 2009 performed because of proteinuria. Data were collected on demographic, analytical, and histological characteristics.", 
    "924": "The study included 49 biopsies from 65% men with an overall mean age of 52 \u00b1 13 years. The mean time from transplant to biopsy was 6.5 \u00b1 5.3 years. All cases displayed proteinuria: 2.2 g/24 h (1.2-3.2). In 56% of cases, it was also associated with worsening glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (MDRDa 33 \u00b1 16 mL/min). In 14% of cases, the sample was insufficient to determine glomerular pathology, whereas 51% displayed glomerular disease, among which were transplant glomerulopathy (40%), glomerulonephritis (48%), and diabetes (12%). Interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IFTA) was present in 85%: 33% mild, 27% moderate, and 25% severe. Arteriolar hyalinosis was present in 60%. Thirty-four percent of subject lost their grafts at a mean of 11 \u00b1 9 months after the biopsy. The GFR at the time of biopsy was worse among those subjects who returned to dialysis than those who retained function (MDRDa 22 \u00b1 7.5 vs 34 \u00b1 15 mL/min; P = .006). Proteinuria was also greater among those who lost their grafts (4.1 \u00b1 3.4 vs 2.1 \u00b1 1.6 g/24 h; P = .007). The absolute increase in the risk of graft loss was 52% among subjects who displayed moderate to severe versus those who had mild IFTA (relative risk [RR] 7; confidence interval [CI] 1.8-28; P < .001). The presence of glomerulosclerosis >50% was also associated with a 48% absolute increased risk of graft loss compared with those patients with no glomerulosclerosis or <50% (RR 3; CI 1.5-12; P = .02). After the biopsy, the dose of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin receptor antagonist was increased in 90%, with 34% of subjects, experiencing a change in immunosuppression.",

Our aim in this study was to compare GFR, proteinuria, albuminuria, blood pressure (BP) effects, and anemia after switching to sirolimus (SRL) among renal transplant recipients with CAN versus NEO.", 
    "927": "Fifty-five kidney transplant recipients with conversion from CNI to SRL owing to CAN or NEO were analyzed for the variables at 6 months before, at the time of, and at 6 months and 1, 2, and 3 years after the switch to SRL.",

The values of proteinuria (mg/24 h/1.73 m(2)) before (665 \u00b1 136 vs 329 \u00b1 69; P = .036) as well as at 1 (1,122 \u00b1 306 vs 863 \u00b1 190; P = .478) and at 2 years after conversion (1,360 \u00b1 430 vs 457 \u00b1 154; P = .045) showed some significant differences, as did the use of both antiangiotensin agents, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker at the moment of switch (35% vs 0%; P = .005) at 1 year (69% vs. 6% P = .02) and at 2 years (67% vs 28%; P = .047). There were no differences in graft survival (log rank: P = .515). By logistic regression analysis, the best covariate associated with GFR >45 mL/min at 2 years was GFR >60 mL/min at the moment of switch to SRL (odds ratio, 1.33; 95% confidence interval, 1.002-1.74).",

    "934": "The coordinated interaction of the components of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) with reproductive hormones such as progesterone, oestrogens and cortisol during pregnancy has been widely reported to play a vital role in foetal and placental development in various species, significantly influencing the proper achievement of pregnancy and foetal viability at birth. These interactions have not yet been clarified in mares. Thus, the purpose of the present research was to analyse the relationship between cortisol (CORT), progesterone (P4) and oestrone sulphate (OESTRONE), and the components of the RAAS, renin (REN), angiotensin II (ANG-II) and aldosterone (ALD) concentrations in Spanish broodmares during pregnancy. Venous blood samples were obtained monthly from a total of 31 Purebred Spanish broodmares aged between 5 and 15 years during the 11 months of pregnancy. Plasma and serum REN, ANG-II, ALD, P4, OESTRONE and CORT concentrations were analysed by competitive immunoassay. Pregnancy in Purebred Spanish broodmares is characterised by a progressive increase in REN and ALD, a decrease in CORT levels, variable fluctuations in P4 and OESTRONE and no variations in ANG-II concentrations (P < 0.05). Serum P4 was not correlated with either ALD or CORT. The OESTRONE and REN levels were not correlated, while OESTRONE and ALD showed a positive correlation (r = 0.16; P < 0.05). These results suggest that the sustained stimulation of the RAAS in normal pregnancy in Spanish broodmares is not totally dependent on the changes in P4 and CORT concentrations, despite the involvement of OESTRONE in the secretion of ALD. This brings into question the possible involvement of oestrogen in the secretion of ALD by a mechanism which is not exclusively dependent on REN. Consequently, at physiological levels, OESTRONE is not the only stimulus for REN synthesis, and the mineralocorticoids ALD and CORT do not show a competitive mechanism with P4 during pregnancy in mares. Other mechanisms which do not depend on these hormones should be considered in the modification of the RAAS during pregnancy in Spanish mares.", 
    "935": "Persons with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis carry an exceptionally high burden of cardiovascular disease. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) are recommended for patients on dialysis, but there are few data regarding their effectiveness in ESRD.", 
    "936": "We conducted a secondary analysis of results of the HEMO study, a randomized trial of dialysis dose and membrane flux in patients on maintenance hemodialysis. We focused on the nonrandomized exposure of ACEI use, using proportional hazards regression and a propensity score analysis. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes examined in the present analysis were cardiovascular hospitalization, heart failure hospitalization, and the composite outcomes of death or cardiovascular hospitalization and death or heart failure hospitalization.", 
    "937": "In multivariable-adjusted analyses, there were no significant associations among ACEI use and mortality (hazard ratio 0.97, 95% CI 0.82-1.14), cardiovascular hospitalization, and either composite outcome. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor use was associated with a higher risk of heart failure hospitalization (hazard ratio 1.41, 95% CI 1.11-1.80). In the propensity score-matched cohort, ACEI use was not significantly associated with any outcomes, including heart failure hospitalization.", 
    "938": "In a well-characterized cohort of patients on maintenance hemodialysis, ACEI use was not significantly associated with mortality or cardiovascular morbidity. The higher risk of heart failure hospitalization associated with ACEI use may not only reflect residual confounding but also highlights gaps in evidence when applying treatments proven effective in the general population to patients with ESRD. Our results underscore the need for definitive trials in ESRD to inform the treatment of cardiovascular disease.", 
    "939": "The identification of novel endogenous and exogenous molecules acting in the complex mechanism of regulating the vascular tonus has always been of great interest. The discovery of bradykinin (1949) and the bradykinin-potentiating peptides (1965) had a pivotal influence in the field, respectively, in understanding cardiovascular pathophysiology and in the development of captopril, the first active-site directed inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme, and used worldwide to treat human hypertension. Both discoveries originated from studies of envenoming by the snake Bothrops jararaca. The aim of the present article is to reveal that the snake proline-rich oligopeptides, known as bradykinin-potentiating peptides, are still a source of surprising scientific discoveries, some of them useful not only to reveal potential new targets but also to introduce prospective lead molecules for drug development. In particular, we emphasize argininosuccinate synthetase as a new functional target for one of bradykinin-potentiating peptides found in B. jararaca, Bj-BPP-10c. This decapeptide leads to argininosuccinate synthetase activation, consequently sustaining increased nitric oxide production, a critical endogenous molecule to reduce the arterial blood pressure.",

Some physicochemical, functional and angiotesin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory properties of amaranth vicilin were studied in this work and compared with the 11S globulin.", 
    "941": "Fluorescence spectroscopy results indicated that 7S globulin tryptophans were more exposed to the solvent and, by calorimetry, the 7S globulin denaturation temperature (T(d) ) was found lower than the 11S globulin T(d) , suggesting a more flexible structure. The 7S globulin surface hydrophobicity was higher than that of the 11S globulin, which is in agreement with the better emulsifying properties of the 7S globulin. The solubility in neutral buffer of the 7S globulin (851 \u00b1 25 g kg(-1) ) was also higher than that of the 11S globulin (195 \u00b1 6 g kg(-1) ). Bioinformatic analyses showed the presence of ACE inhibitory peptides encrypted in 7S tryptic sequences and peptides released after in vitro gastrointestinal digestion showed a high ACE-inhibitory capacity (IC(50) = 0.17 g L(-1) ), similar to that of 11S globulin peptides.", 
    "942": "Compared with the 11S globulin, the 7S globulin presents similar ACE inhibitory activity and some functional advantages, better solubility and emulsifying activity, which suits some food requirements. The functional behavior has been related with the structural properties.", 
    "943": "Dry cough is the most common reason for stopping angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) therapy. The role of ACE in the metabolism of bradykinin has been proposed as a pathogenic mechanism. This study included a complete analysis of the variability of the genes involved in bradykinin metabolism (ACE and XPNPEP2) and bradykinin receptors (BDKRB2). We included two polymorphisms in the ABO (related to ACE levels); two polymorphisms in the AGTR1, and one polymorphism in the BKRB1 (related to ACEi response).", 
    "944": "A total of 281 patients who had been treated with ACEi were retrospectively recruited [102 patients were considered as cases (cough) and 179 patients were considered as controls (no cough)], and 56 polymorphisms were tested for association.", 
    "945": "We found that genetic polymorphisms in BDKRB2 [rs8016905; P=0.003; odds ratio (OR)=2.21] and ABO (rs495828; P=0.001; OR=2.45) are associated with ACEi-induced cough after correction for multiple testing. The effect of polymorphisms in ABO was sex specific (female patients; P=0.0006; OR=3.26). When we analyzed the subgroup of patients homozygous GG for rs4343, two polymorphisms in the ACE were found to have protective properties (rs4459610 and rs4267385; P=0.005 and 0.004; OR=0.25). We also found a strong interaction between the ABO polymorphisms, rs495828 and rs8176746 (P<0.0001; OR=3.7).", 
    "946": "These results highlight the importance of genetic determinants of ACE levels as good predictors of the ACEi response, and provide ABO as a good candidate gene for pharmacogenetic studies of ACEi-related cough. Moreover, our results also confirm the importance of bradykinin in the pathogenesis of this adverse effect.", 
    "947": "Female growth-restricted offspring are normotensive in adulthood. However, ovariectomy induces a marked increase in mean arterial pressure (MAP) that is abolished by renin angiotensin system (RAS) blockade, suggesting RAS involvement in the etiology of hypertension induced by ovariectomy in adult female growth-restricted offspring. Blockade of the RAS also abolishes hypertension in adult male growth-restricted offspring. Moreover, sensitivity to acute ANG II is enhanced in male growth-restricted offspring. Thus, we hypothesized that an enhanced sensitivity to acute ANG II may contribute to hypertension induced by ovariectomy in female growth-restricted offspring. Female offspring were subjected to ovariectomy (OVX) or sham ovariectomy (intact) at 10 wk of age. Cardio-renal hemodynamic parameters were determined before and after an acute infusion of ANG II (100 ng\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7min(-1) for 30 min) at 16 wk of age in female offspring pretreated with enalapril (40 mg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7day(-1) for 7 days). Acute ANG II induced a significant increase in MAP in intact growth-restricted offspring (155 \u00b1 2 mmHg, P < 0.05) relative to intact control (145 \u00b1 4 mmHg). Ovariectomy augmented the pressor response to ANG II in growth-restricted offspring (163 \u00b1 2 mmHg, P < 0.05), with no effect in control (142 \u00b1 2 mmHg). Acute pressor responses to phenylephrine did not differ in growth-restricted offspring relative to control, intact, or ovariectomized. Furthermore, renal hemodynamic responses to acute ANG II were significantly enhanced only in ovariectomized female growth-restricted offspring. Thus, these data suggest that enhanced responsiveness to acute ANG II is programmed by intrauterine growth restriction and that sensitivity to acute ANG II is modulated by ovarian hormones in female growth-restricted offspring.", 
    "948": "Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) produce negative inotropic effects on the human myocardium at clinically relevant plasma concentrations. We conducted this study to determine whether PPI use was associated with excess mortality in patients with both ischaemic and non-ischaemic heart failure (HF).", 
    "949": "The impact of PPIs on all-cause mortality was examined using a population-based cohort of Alberta residents over the age of 65 with a diagnosis of HF, logistic regression analysis, and a nested case-control study were used to examine the association between current medication use and mortality. Compared with non-PPI users (n= 15,676, 71% of the HF cohort), PPI users (n= 6431, 29% of the HF cohort) were more likely to be women and had more co-morbidities. Mortality in the first year after diagnosis of HF was 32% (n= 5659) in PPI non-users and 26% (n= 1153) in PPI users. Logistic regression modelling showed that PPI use was associated with a relative reduction in mortality rates compared with non-use [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81-0.93]. Nested case-control analysis of the 5815 patients who died matched to 9934 controls, revealed that current PPI use was not associated with excess mortality (aOR 0.88, 95%CI 0.77-1.01), while use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blocker s (aOR 0.70, 95%CI 0.62-0.79) or beta-blockers (aOR 0.57, 95%CI 0.50-0.66), was associated with a relative reduction in mortality.",

The activity of the renin-angiotensin system is generally increased in obesity and experimental evidence has shown that angiotensin influences appetite and metabolism as well as mechanisms that induce adipose tissue growth and metabolism in peripheral organs. This review summarises some of the key evidence from animal and human experiments that links the renin-angiotensin system to obesity and metabolic disease. This research has been greatly aided by the continuing development of new pharmaceuticals that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system. While their primary use is in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure, a range of experimental and clinical evidence indicates their potential use in the treatment of obesity and metabolic disease.",

There was high utilization of ACEIs in Scotland following intensive demand-side measures, similar to Austria and Croatia. Demand-side measures in Spain (Catalonia) and Sweden also appeared to moderate angiotensin receptor blockers utilization. The combination of measures helped stabilize expenditure on renin-angiotensin drugs when adjusted for population sizes despite appreciable increases in volumes. The only exception was Portugal, with less intensive measures.", 
    "956": "Multiple and intensive demand-side measures enhanced prescribing efficiency. The more intense follow-up of ARB prescribing restrictions in Croatia had a greater influence on subsequent utilization patterns than Austria. Both findings confirm earlier studies. Reforms also favorably enhanced the prescribing of generic losartan once available.", 
    "957": "European guidelines recommend a combination of at least two antihypertensive drugs to achieve blood pressure (BP) goals in the majority of patients. In addition, they encourage simplification of treatment regimens using single-pill, fixed-dose combinations (FDCs) to aid compliance. Of the preferred combinations, those based on angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) may be more desirable than those based on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, because of equivalent efficacy and superior tolerability. Significantly better BP reductions and control rates have been observed with the dual combinations of ARBs with amlodipine or hydrochlorothiazide (HCZT) compared with component monotherapies. Furthermore, in the 15-20% of patients who require triple combination therapy to achieve BP goals, fixed-dose triple combinations with an ARB, calcium-channel blocker and diuretic, which have recently become available, provide significantly better BP reductions and control compared with dual combinations. Within the ARB class, olmesartan stands out as being one that has been recently investigated in a considerable number of studies that are relevant to the modern concept of FDC therapy in terms of both dual and triple combination therapy. The availability of such single-pill FDCs has the potential to deliver strong antihypertensive efficacy with good tolerability and improved compliance.",

The main baseline predictors of SBP control <140 mmHg were region (USA >Nordic region) and Caucasian ethnicity in both randomization arms. A higher diastolic BP and the use of lipid lowering agents indicated favorable effects in the B+H arm only. The predictors of uncontrolled SBP were: (i) higher baseline SBP values, (ii) higher number of previous antihypertensive medications in both arms, (iii) the previous use of insulin in the B+A arm, and (iv) pre-trial calcium channel blocker (CCB) use in the B+H arm. Additionally, pre-trial use of thiazides and electrocardiogram (ECG)-left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) at baseline predicted higher, and smoking lower absolute SBP in the B+A arm and the use of thiazides and proteinuria a higher SBP in the B+H arm.", 
    "961": "Irrespective of treatment, patients in the USA and Caucasians achieved better SBP control, whereas higher baseline SBP and more previous antihypertensive medications indicated less control. Concomitant use of lipid lowering treatment indicated a better SBP control in the benazepril + hydrochlorothiazide arm.

    "962": "Scientific research has proved that coagulation system is more active in patients with chronic heart failure than in healthy people. Therefore, the aim of this article was to review the data in literature about changes in coagulation system after treatment of chronic heart failure with \u03b2-adrenoblockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium antagonists, cardiac glycosides, diuretics, anticoagulants, and antiagregants. It is known that \u03b2-adrenoblockers used separately decrease platelet aggregation and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors reduce P-selectin expression as well. Low-molecular-weight heparin decreases the concentrations of prothrombin fragments, D-dimers; orally administered anticoagulants reduce the concentrations of interleukin 6, von Willebrand factor, intercellular adhesion molecules, fibrinogen 1+2 and increases the concentration of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. Both anticoagulants reduce the levels of VII:C factors and thrombin-antithrombin III complex. The use of aspirin together with clopidogrel reduces the concentration of intercellular adhesion and platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecules and expression of P-selectins; however, these concentrations do not vary while using aspirin alone. The treatment with ACE inhibitors together with calcium antagonists and \u03b2-adrenoblockers decreases activated partial thromboplastin time, concentrations of D-dimers, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, vascular cell adhesion molecules, CD63 and expression of L- and P-selectins. While analyzing the effect of abovementioned agents, it is necessary to mention that data reported by different authors are not consistent. Therefore, the effect of particular drugs on the particular parameters of coagulation system has not been completely elucidated.", 
    "963": "A simple, specific, fast and sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the simultaneous analysis of delapril (DEL) and manidipine (MAN) from their combination formulation was developed and validated using fesoterodine as the internal standard (IS). The LC-MS/MS method was carried out on a Luna C8 column (50 \u00d7 3.0 mm i.d., 3 \u00b5m) with a mobile phase consisting of methanol and 10 mmol L(-1) ammonium acetate (90 : 0, v/v), run at a flow rate of 0.25 mL min(-1).

The total analysis time was 3 min and the method was linear in the concentration range of 6-1080 ng mL(-1) and 2-360 ng mL(-1) for DEL and MAN, respectively. Parameters investigated for the method validation, such as the specificity, linearity, precision, accuracy and robustness, gave results within the acceptable range. Moreover, the proposed method was successfully applied for the simultaneous determination of DEL and MAN and the results were compared to validated liquid chromatography and capillary electrophoresis methods showing non-significant differences (P = 0.9).", 
    "964": "Systolic heart failure (HF) is a complex systemic syndrome that can result from a wide variety of clinical conditions and gene mutations. Despite phenotypic similarities, characterized by ventricular dilatation and reduced contractility, the extent of common and divergent gene expression between different forms of HF remains a matter of intense debate.", 
    "965": "Using a meta-analysis of 28 experimental (mouse, rat, dog) and human HF microarray studies, we demonstrate that gene expression changes are characterized by a coordinated and reciprocal regulation of major metabolic and signaling pathways. In response to a wide variety of stressors in animal models of HF, including ischemia, pressure overload, tachypacing, chronic isoproterenol infusion, Chagas disease, and transgenic mouse models, major metabolic pathways are invariably downregulated, whereas cell signaling pathways are upregulated. In contrast to this uniform transcriptional pattern that recapitulates a fetal gene expression program in experimental animal models of HF, human HF microarray studies displayed a greater heterogeneity, with some studies even showing upregulation of metabolic and downregulation of signaling pathways in end-stage human hearts. These discrepant results between animal and human studies are due to a number of factors, prominently cardiac disease and variable exposure to cold cardioplegic solution in nonfailing human samples, which can downregulate transcripts involved in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), thus mimicking gene expression patterns observed in failing samples. Additionally, \u03b2-blockers and ACE inhibitor use in end-stage human HF was associated with higher levels of myocardial OXPHOS transcripts, thus partially reversing the fetal gene expression pattern. In human failing samples, downregulation of metabolism was associated with hemodynamic markers of disease severity.", 
    "966": "Irrespective of the etiology, gene expression in failing myocardium is characterized by downregulation of metabolic transcripts and concomitant upregulation of cell signaling pathways. Gene expression changes along this metabolic-signaling axis in mammalian myocardium are a consistent feature in the heterogeneous transcriptional response observed in phenotypically similar models of HF.", 
    "967": "Severe aortic stenosis due to calcification of the aortic valve is the most common indication for aortic valve replacement in the United States and Europe. The standard therapy for symptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis is replacement of the valve. Some of the risk factors and pathophysiologic mechanisms in atherosclerosis play an important role in the development of calcific aortic stenosis. In the last few years, there have been an increased number of publications regarding the use of medications in order to delay the progression of aortic stenosis. These medications include statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and biphosphanates. This article describes and summarizes some of the medical approaches that have emerged to alter the progression of aortic stenosis. Currently, only statins have been evaluated in randomized, placebo-control trials. Furthermore, statins have not proven to alter the progression of aortic stenosis. Ongoing randomized controlled trials with the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, statins, and biphosphonates will determine the use of these medications to delay the progression of aortic stenosis.",

Multivariate analysis showed that eGFR (p = < 0.001) and not use of EPO in the pre transplant period (p < 0.001) are strong predictors of PTA.

    "972": "Astrocytes and microglia are able to degrade potentially neurotoxic \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) deposits typical for Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Contrary to microglia, astrocytes degrade human A\u03b2 from tissue sections in vitro without any additional stimulation, but it has remained unclear whether transplanted astrocytes are able to clear deposited human A\u03b2 in vivo. We transplanted adult mouse astrocytes into the hippocampi of transgenic mice mimicking AD and observed their fate, effects on microglial responses, and A\u03b2 clearance. After 2-months follow-up time, we discovered a significant reduction in A\u03b2 burden compared with AD mice infused with PBS only. The remaining A\u03b2 deposits were fragmented and most of the A\u03b2 immunoreactivity was seen within the transplanted astrocytes. Concomitant to A\u03b2 reduction, both CD68 and CD45 immunoreactivities were significantly upregulated but phagocytic microglia were often surrounding and engulfing A\u03b2 burdened, TUNEL-positive astrocytes rather than co-localizing with A\u03b2 alone. Astrocytes are known to degrade A\u03b2 also by secreting proteases involved in A\u03b2 catabolism. To study the contribution of neprilysin (NEP), angiotensin-converting enzyme-1 (ACE-1), and endothelin-converting enzyme-2 (ECE-2) in human A\u03b2 clearance, we utilized an ex vivo assay to demonstrate that adult astrocytes respond to human A\u03b2 by upregulating NEP expression. Further, incubation of adult astrocytes with known inhibitors of NEP, ACE-1, or ECE-2 significantly inhibited the removal of human A\u03b2 from the tissue suggesting an important role for these proteases in A\u03b2 clearance by adult astrocytes ex vivo.", 
    "973": "Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) contribute to endothelial regeneration. Angiotensin II (Ang II) through Ang II type 1 receptor (AT(1)-R) activation plays an important role in vascular damage. The effect of Ang II on EPCs and the involved molecular mechanisms are incompletely understood. Stimulation with Ang II decreased the number of cultured human early outgrowth EPCs, which express both AT(1)-R and Ang II type 2 receptor, mediated through AT(1)-R activation and induction of oxidative stress. Ang II redox-dependently induced EPC apoptosis through increased apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation; decreased Bcl-2 and increased Bax expression; and activation of caspase 3 but had no effect on the low cell proliferation. In addition, Ang II impaired colony-forming and migratory capacities of early outgrowth EPCs. Ang II infusion diminished numbers and functional capacities of EPCs in wild-type (WT) but not AT(1)a-R knockout mice (AT(1)a(-/-)). Reendothelialization after focal carotid endothelial injury was decreased during Ang II infusion. Salvage of reendothelialization by intravenous application of spleen-derived progenitor cells into Ang II-treated WT mice was pronounced with AT(1)a(-/-) cells compared with WT cells, and transfusion of Ang II-pretreated WT cells into WT mice without Ang II infusion was associated with less reendothelialization. Transplantation of AT(1)a(-/-) bone marrow reduced atherosclerosis development in cholesterol-fed apolipoprotein E-deficient mice compared with transplantation of apolipoprotein E-deficient or WT bone marrow. Randomized treatment of patients with stable coronary artery disease with the AT(1)-R blocker telmisartan significantly increased the number of circulating CD34/KDR-positive EPCs. Ang II through AT(1)-R activation, oxidative stress, and redox-sensitive apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1-dependent proapoptotic pathways impairs EPCs in vitro and in vivo, resulting in diminished vascular regeneration.",

Platelet aggregation was assessed by conventional aggregometry, and platelet adhesion and aggregation under flow conditions by cone-and-plate(let) technology (Impact-R). Smoking, diabetes, and hypertension were more common in AMI compared to control subjects (p\u2009<\u20090.01 for all). Furthermore, aspirin, clopidogrel, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and statin administration were more common in AMI compared to controls (p\u2009<\u20090.01 for all). %FMD but not %NTG was significantly lower in AMI patients compared to controls (10.2\u2009\u00b1\u20094.2% vs. 15.4\u2009\u00b1\u20094.4%; p\u2009<\u20090.001 and 17.2\u2009\u00b1\u20093.9% vs. 18.0\u2009\u00b1\u20093.7%, p\u2009=\u20090.803, respectively). %FMD was significantly and inversely associated with all platelet functions tests (p\u2009<\u20090.001) in all study participants. In a multivariate logistic regression (unadjusted and adjusted for age, gender, smoking status, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, overweight, family history, and concomitant medications), %FMD remained the best predictor of platelet function, irrespective of group allocation (AMI patients or controls).

IP includes several patterns, such as inappropriate dose or duration, prescribing drugs having significant drug-disease or drug-drug interactions, and the omission of potentially beneficial medications. The main purpose was to evaluate the prevalence of IP among medical inpatients in a medical center, so to evaluate the associative factors of IP in Taiwan. From January to December of 2009, all patients aged 65 years and older who were discharged from the medical wards of Taipei Veterans General Hospital were randomly sampled for study (the sampling rate around 1.0%). The IP was evaluated by the STOPP and START criteria. Each medical record was carefully reviewed by physicians who had been trained. Overall, 520 records of elderly medical ward inpatients (mean age = 79.2 \u00b1 6.7 years, 73.8% males) were included for study. In total, 3455 items of medication were prescribed for these 520 patients (mean = 6.6 \u00b1 3.2 items). According to STOPP criteria, 36.2% of the study subjects had at least one potentially inappropriate medication (PIM). The most common PIMs were: (1) medications that may adversely affect those who are prone to falls, e.g., benzodiazepines, neuroleptics and first generation antihistamines (14.2%). (2) Ca-channel blockers with chronic constipation (12.3%). (3) Use of neuroleptic agents (5.6%). (4) Long-term, long-acting benzodiazepines (2.5%). (5) Prolonged use of first generation antihistamines (2.1%). Besides, 218 patients (41.9%) had at least one potentially prescribing omission (PPO). Common PPOs included: (1) statin therapy in diabetes mellitus if coexisting major cardiovascular risk factors present (19.0%). (2) Antiplatelet therapy in diabetes mellitus with co-existing major cardiovascular risk factors (12.5%).

BALB/c mice (n = 32) were divided into four groups, an untreated control group and three treatment groups given 12.5, 25 or 50 mg/kg per day captopril. Intraperitoneal injections of either 0.9% saline (control) or captopril began 2 days before the introduction of titanium alloy particles and calvaria bone from a syngeneic mouse into established air pouches. Mice were sacrificed 10 days after bone/titanium alloy implantation, and pouch membranes and implants were collected for histological and molecular analysis. Low-dose captopril (12.5 mg/kg per day) was found to inhibit titanium particle-induced tissue inflammation and inflammatory osteolysis. Pouch membrane thickness and inflammatory cellular infiltration were significantly reduced relative to controls. Captopril also inhibited production of the inflammatory cytokines tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin-1\u03b2 and receptor activator of nuclear factor-\u03baB ligand compared with controls.

Vasodilation is usually evaluated in isolated blood vessels, but except for nitric oxide (NO), relatively little attention is given to the in vivo efficiency of particular vasodilator mechanisms. The aim of our study was to evaluate the contribution of endogenous vasodilator prostanoids, Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels and NO to blood pressure (BP) maintenance in rats with three different forms of experimental hypertension. Both principal vasopressor systems (the renin-angiotensin system and the sympathetic nervous system) were blocked by captopril and pentolinium in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), Dahl salt-hypertensive (DS-HS) rats and rats with NO-deficient hypertension, as well as in their normotensive controls. Thereafter, we monitored BP changes in rats subjected to either a sequential or an isolated blockade of prostanoid synthesis by the non-selective cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin, of Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels by tetraethylammonium and of NO formation by N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester. All three forms of experimental hypertension were characterized by augmented sympathetic vasoconstriction. The vasodilatation exerted by endogenous prostanoids and Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels was enhanced in all forms of hypertension, almost proportionally to BP elevation. On the contrary, NO-dependent vasodilatation was not enhanced in any form of experimental hypertension, and there was a severe relative NO deficiency in both, SHRs and DS-HS rats. In conclusion, our data suggested that there is a compensatory activation of vasodilator prostanoids and Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels in rats with experimental hypertension, whereas NO-dependent vasodilatation is not augmented. Thus, the overall activity of vasodilator systems failed to compensate for augmented sympathetic vasoconstriction in hypertensive animals.",

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors provide imperfect renoprotection in advanced type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular risk remains elevated. Endothelin (ET)-1 has a role in renal and cardiac dysfunction in diabetes. Here, we assessed whether combination therapy with an ACE inhibitor and ET(A) receptor antagonist provided reno- and cardioprotection in rats with overt type 2 diabetes. Four groups of Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats were treated orally from 4 (when proteinuric) to 8 mo with vehicle, ramipril (1 mg/kg), sitaxsentan (60 mg/kg), and ramipril plus sitaxsentan. Lean rats served as controls. Combined therapy ameliorated proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis mostly as a result of the action of ramipril. Simultaneous blockade of ANG II and ET-1 pathways normalized renal monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and interstitial inflammation. Cardiomyocyte loss, volume enlargement, and capillary rarefaction were prominent abnormalities of ZDF myocardium. Myocyte volume was reduced by ramipril and sitaxsentan, which also ameliorated heart capillary density. Drug combination restored myocardial structure and reestablished an adequate capillary network in the presence of increased cardiac expression of VEGF/VEGFR-1, and significant reduction of oxidative stress. In conclusion, in type 2 diabetes concomitant blockade of ANG II synthesis and ET-1 biological activity through an ET(A) receptor antagonist led to substantial albeit not complete renoprotection, almost due to the ACE inhibitor. The drug combination also showed cardioprotective properties, which however, were mainly dependent on the contribution of the ET(A) receptor antagonist through the action of VEGF.",

Following 8 weeks on a high fat diet rats were treated with 30 mg/kg streptozotocin (i.p.) and after 4 additional weeks a group of these rats was treated for 12 weeks with Ilepatril followed by analysis of neural and vascular functions. Included in these studies were age-matched control rats and rats fed a high fat diet and treated with or without Ilepatril. Diabetic and diet induced obese rats have characteristics of insulin resistance, slowing of nerve conduction velocity, thermal hypoalgesia, reduction in intraepidermal nerve fiber density in the hindpaw and impairment in vascular relaxation to acetylcholine and calcitonin gene-related peptide in epineurial arterioles of the sciatic nerve. Treatment with Ilepatril was efficacious in improving all of these endpoints although improvement of insulin resistance in diabetic rats was minimal.

A similar reduction in epithelial AngII receptor type 1 was also observed in human Peutz-Jeghers syndrome tumours contrasting with high expression of the receptor in the tumour stroma. Mechanistically, the authors showed two pieces of data that position Lkb1 in renin expression regulation, and they implied the importance of Lkb1 in linking cell responses with nutrient levels. First, the authors showed that Lkb1 deletion in isolated epithelial organoid culture resulted in renin upregulation only when the organoids were challenged with external cues such as AngII; second, that renin upregulation was dependent upon the MEK/ERK pathway in a circadian fashion and corresponded to active feeding time when nutrient levels were high.",

    "1018": "Cardiac dysfunction is a frequent manifestation of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and a common cause of death for individuals with this condition. Early diastolic dysfunction and focal fibrosis proceed to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), complicated by heart failure and arrhythmia in most patients. Improvements in the management of respiratory insufficiency in DMD have improved lifespan and overall prognosis, but heart failure and sudden death continue to impact survival and quality of life for people with DMD. Since the specific mechanisms resulting in heart failure for people with DMD are poorly understood, current treatments are not targeted, but rely on approaches that are considered standard for DCM. These approaches include angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonists. Data from one trial in DMD support the use of ACE inhibitors before the onset of left ventricular dysfunction. Angiotensin receptor blockers have shown similar efficacy to ACE inhibitors in numerous studies of dilated cardiomyopathy, and are a good choice for patients who cannot tolerate ACE inhibition. The pathogenesis of DMD-associated cardiomyopathy may be similar to other genetic disorders of the cytoskeletal complex of ventricular myocytes, though unique features offer targeted opportunities to impact treatment. Novel areas of investigation are focused on the regulatory role of dystrophin in relation to neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and transient receptor potential canonical channels (TRPC). Inhibition of phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) addresses several aspects of regulatory dysfunction induced by dystrophin deficiency, and studies with PDE5-inhibitors have shown benefits in murine models of DMD. PDE5-inhibitors are currently under investigation in at least one study in humans. This article focuses on mechanisms of cardiac dysfunction, as well as potential targets for pharmacologic manipulation to prevent or improve cardiomyopathy in DMD.",

It is a well-known target for combating hypertension and related cardiovascular diseases. In a recent study by Bhuyan and Mugesh [Org. Biomol. Chem.

Here, we report the crystal structures of human testis ACE (tACE) and a homologue of ACE, known as AnCE, from Drosophila melanogaster in complex with the most promising selenium analogue of captopril (SeCap) determined at 2.4 and 2.35 \u00c5 resolution, respectively. The inhibitor binds at the active site of tACE and AnCE in an analogous fashion to that observed for captopril and provide the first examples of a protein-selenolate interaction. These new structures of tACE-SeCap and AnCE-SeCap inhibitor complexes presented here provide important information for further exploration of zinc coordinating selenium-based ACE inhibitor pharmacophores with significant antioxidant activity.",

It was surprising that single-steroid treatment without immunosuppressive drugs was preferred in 34.4% of patients to steroids associated with immunosuppressive drugs (the Ponticelli regimen), used only in 26.6%. Ace inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers were given as the therapy of choice in 23.4% of cases, as an adjunct to steroids in 41%, and to steroids/ immunosuppressants in 52%.

    "1037": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is the most important mechanism leading to cardiovascular and renal damage in diabetic patients. Studies conducted until now have unequivocally demonstrated that antihypertensive treatment with RAS blockers (angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers) improve the prognosis of patients with diabetes, by reducing rates of cardiovascular events and preventing or delaying the progression of diabetic nephropathy. However, despite the benefits of such treatment, cardio-renal events are still very frequent in diabetics. Several strategies for reducing this cardiovascular and renal risk have been proposed, but among them, a more complete blockade of the RAS seems the most attractive. Direct renin inhibitors are RAS blockers with some particularities, such as their ability to reduce plasma renin activity or the possibility to modulate tissue and intracellular RAS, which could represent a theoretical advantage when treating diabetic patients. In experimental and clinical studies conducted until now, aliskiren is able to reduce blood pressure in diabetics, alone or in combination with ACE inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers. Moreover, aliskiren reduces markers of cardiac and renal disease, such as left ventricular hypertrophy or post-infarction ventricular remodeling, as well as proteinuria in diabetics already treated with other RAS blockers. The translation of these promising results to the clinical arena is currently being investigated in the Aliskiren Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Using Cardio-Renal Endpoints (ALTITUDE), where more than 8600 diabetic patients with chronic kidney disease and at high-risk of cardio-renal events are treated with aliskiren or placebo added to the current treatment consisting of another RAS blocker. If positive, aliskiren will be the treatment of choice in the prevention of cardiorenal disease in diabetics.",

The IO 0.3 M NaCl infusion-evoked ingestive and rejection taste related behaviors were comparable in the LPBN vehicle- vs. the LPBN moxonidine-injected groups. In a second experiment, rats received the same FURO+CAP treatments and LPBN injections. However, beginning 15 min after the LPBN injections, they were given access to water and 0.3M NaCl and were allowed to consume the fluids for most of the next 60 min with the free access intake being interrupted only for a few minutes at 15, 30 and 60 min after the fluids became available. During each of these three brief periods, a taste reactivity test was conducted. On the three taste reactivity tests rats that received LPBN vehicle injections showed progressive declines in ingestive responses and gradual increases in rejection responses. However, in contrast to the LPBN vehicle treated rats, animals receiving bilateral injections of LPBN moxonidine maintained a high number of ingestive responses and a low number of rejection responses throughout the test period even in spite of evidencing substantial water and 0.3 M NaCl consumption during the periods of free access. The results suggest that after \u03b12-adrenoceptor agonist delivery to the LPBN the acceptance of 0.3 M NaCl is sustained and the negative attributes of the solution are minimized. The maintained positive rewarding qualities of 0.3 M NaCl are likely to account for why LPBN moxonidine treated rats show such a remarkable salt appetite when assayed by the volume of hypertonic 0.3 M NaCl consumed.",

    "1070": "As the increasing prevalence of diabetes reaches epidemic proportions worldwide, diabetic nephropathy and associated end-stage renal failure will be an unavoidable major health burden to not only individuals with diabetes and their families, but also to the health systems both in developed and developing countries. Over the past decade, a large body of research has focused on diabetic nephropathy ranging from studies in molecular signaling, hemodynamic regulation and pharmaceutical intervention to clinical outcomes. It is likely that the pathophysiology of diabetic nephropathy involves a multifactorial interaction between metabolic and hemodynamic factors. Metabolic factors involve glucose-dependent pathways, such as advanced glycation end-products and their receptors. Hemodynamic factors include various vasoactive hormones, such as components of the renin-angiotensin system. It is likely that these metabolic and hemodynamic factors interact through shared molecular and signaling pathways, such as nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells and protein kinase\u2003C with associated reactive oxygen species generation. It is likely that these contributing factors cause pathological damage not only to the glomerulus, in particular podocytes, but also to the tubulointerstitium. Specific inhibitors of the various pathways are now available and these emerging pharmaceutical interventions might have potential implications for the prevention and treatment of diabetic nephropathy. The mainstay of therapy remains the achievement of optimal glycemic and blood pressure control in order to slow the progression of diabetic nephropathy. Agents that interrupt the renin-angiotensin system have been shown to be particularly useful as renoprotective agents in both hypertensive and normotensive type\u20031 and type\u20032 diabetic subjects.

This study sought to evaluate the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and other nephrotoxic medications in the risk for the development of AKI in neonates and children undergoing cardiac surgery. A retrospective review of all patients younger than 2 years admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit after cardiac surgery from March 2007 to September 2008 was conducted. Patients were included in the review if they received furosemide alone or in combination with an ACE inhibitor. Creatinine clearance was calculated, and the patient's maximal degree of AKI was classified by pRIFLE. A P value less than 0.05 was considered significant. Of the 319 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 149 (47%) received furosemide therapy alone and 170 (53%) received a combination of furosemide and an ACE inhibitor. Patients in the furosemide-only group (age, 5 months) were older than the patients who received both furosemide and an ACE inhibitor (age, 3.8 months; P = 0.024). Despite statistically higher Aristotle scores in the ACE-inhibitor group, the intraoperative variables did not differ between the two groups. Postoperatively, the ACE-inhibitor group had a decreased creatinine clearance (55.3 ml/min/1.73 m(2)) compared with the furosemide group (64.4 ml/min/1.73 m(2); P = 0.015) and an increased incidence of a pRIFLE maximal score of \"F\" (odds ratio [OR], 1.75; P = 0.033). However, after adjustment for additional risk factors, no difference in the occurrence of AKI resulted (OR, 0.939; P = 0.85) when patients received an ACE inhibitor.

We found that APO treatment ameliorated oxidative stress in an AD mouse model and specifically attenuated the hydrogen peroxide-induced p53-related apoptosis in the SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line. To further understand the mechanism behind this action, we investigated the actions of APO on intracellular redox systems, such as the glutathione cycle and catalase. We studied the effects of specific inhibitors for glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), and catalase (BCNU, MCS, and ATZ, respectively) on the effects of APO. Treatments with MCS or BCNU, but not ATZ, significantly attenuated the protective effects of APO. Interestingly, APO treatment elevated GPx activity, but did not increase the expression of the GPx1 protein. Although BCNU treatment attenuated APO effects, GR activity was not elevated by APO treatment. The same effects were observed in primary neuronal cultures. In addition, treatment with dopamine D1, D2, D3 and D4 receptor antagonists did not counteract the protective action of APO. Thus, APO may enhance GPx activity through dopamine receptor-independent pathways.",

    "1088": "Whether a person will suffer harm from a medication or how severe that harm will be is difficult to predict precisely. As a result, many adverse drug events (ADEs) occur in patients in whom it was reasonable to believe that the drug's benefits exceeded its risks. Improving safety and reducing the burden of ADEs in older adults requires addressing this uncertainty by not only focusing on the appropriateness of the initial prescribing decision, but also by detecting and mitigating adverse events once they have started to occur. Such enhanced monitoring of signs, symptoms, and laboratory parameters can determine whether an adverse event has only mild and short-term consequences or major long-term effects on morbidity and mortality. Although current medication monitoring practices are often suboptimal, several strategies can be leveraged to improve the quality and outcomes of monitoring. These strategies include using health information technology to link pharmacy and laboratory data, prospective delineation of risk, and patient outreach and activation, all within a framework of team-based approaches to patient management. Although many of these strategies are theoretically possible now, they are poorly used and will be difficult to implement without a significant restructuring of medical practice. An enhanced focus on medication monitoring will also require a new conceptual framework to re-engineer the prescribing process. With this approach, prescribing quality does not hinge on static attributes of the initial prescribing decision but entails a dynamic process in which the benefits and harms of drugs are actively monitored, managed, and reassessed over time.",

    "1091": "Hypertension remains an important problem that increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and is a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Achieving long-term control of arterial hypertension, which has an estimated prevalence of 28% in the US adult population, would translate into a significant reduction in cardiovascular events. Specific causes can be identified and treated for certain forms of secondary hypertension, but often it is multifactorial. Therefore, it makes sense to attain blood pressure control by addressing more than one pressor mechanism. Several clinical studies have demonstrated that combination antihypertensive therapy is more effective than monotherapy, and a review of currently published data suggests that approximately 75% of hypertensive individuals will require some form of combination therapy to achieve target blood pressure (BP) goals. To this end, the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of Blood Pressure (JNC 7) has recommended that antihypertensive therapy should start with two drugs when a patient presents with systolic blood pressure (SBP) more than 20\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg above target levels, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) more than 10\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg above target levels, or both.

    "1092": "Cardiovascular (CV) disease is a major factor in mortality rates around the world and contributes to more than one-third of deaths in the US. The underlying cause of CV disease is atherosclerosis, a chronic inflammatory process that is clinically manifested as coronary artery disease, carotid artery disease, or peripheral artery disease. It has been predicted that atherosclerosis will be the primary cause of death in the world by 2020. Consequently, developing a treatment regimen that can slow or even reverse the atherosclerotic process is imperative. Atherogenesis is initiated by endothelial injury due to oxidative stress associated with CV risk factors including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cigarette smoking, dyslipidemia, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. Since the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays a key role in vascular inflammatory responses, hypertension treatment with RAAS-blocking agents (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [ACEIs] and angiotensin II receptor blockers [ARBs]) may slow inflammatory processes and disease progression. Reduced nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability has an important role in the process of endothelial dysfunction and hypertension. Therefore, agents that increase NO and decrease oxidative stress, such as ARBs and ACEIs, may interfere with atherosclerosis. Studies show that angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonism with an ARB improves endothelial function and reduces atherogenesis. In patients with hypertension, the ARB olmesartan medoxomil provides effective blood pressure lowering, with inflammatory marker studies demonstrating significant RAAS suppression. Several prospective, randomized studies show vascular benefits with olmesartan medoxomil: reduced progression of coronary atherosclerosis in patients with stable angina pectoris (OLIVUS); decreased vascular inflammatory markers in patients with hypertension and micro- (pre-clinical) inflammation (EUTOPIA); improved common carotid intima-media thickness and plaque volume in patients with diagnosed atherosclerosis (MORE); and resistance vessel remodeling in patients with stage 1 hypertension (VIOS). Although CV outcomes were not assessed in these studies, the observed benefits in surrogate endpoints of disease suggest that RAAS suppression with olmesartan medoxomil may potentially have beneficial effects on CV outcomes in these patient populations.", 
    "1093": "The limited antifibrotic effect of therapeutic angiotensin blockade, the fact that angiotensin blockade dramatically elevates renin levels, and recent evidence that renin has an angiotensin-independent, receptor-mediated profibrotic action led us to hypothesize that combining renin receptor inhibition and ANG II blockade would increase the antifibrotic effect of angiotensin blockade alone. Using cultured nephritic glomeruli from rats with anti-Thy-1-induced glomerulonephritis, the maximally effective dose of enalaprilate was determined to be 10(-4) M, which reduced mRNAs for transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21, fibronectin (FN), and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) by 49, 65, and 56% and production of TGF-\u03b21 and FN proteins by 60 and 49%, respectively. Disease alone caused 6.8-fold increases in ANG II levels that were reduced 64% with enalaprilate. In contrast, two- and threefold disease-induced increases in renin mRNA and activity were further increased 2- and 3.7-fold with 10(-4) M enalaprilate treatment. Depressing the renin receptor by 80% with small interfering (si) RNA alone reduced fibrotic markers in a manner remarkably similar to enalaprilate alone but had no effect on glomerular renin expression. Enalaprilate and siRNA combination therapy further reduced disease markers. Notably, elevated TGF-\u03b21 and FN production was reduced by 73 and 81%, respectively. These results support the notion of a receptor-mediated profibrotic action of renin, suggest that the limited effectiveness of ANG II blockade may be due, at least in part, to the elevated renin they induce, and support our hypothesis that adding renin receptor inhibitor to ANG II blockade in patients may have therapeutic potential.",

We investigated the hypothesis that enhancing the local activity of the recently established protective axis of the RAS, ACE2/Ang-(1-7), using adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene delivery of ACE2 or Ang-(1-7) would confer protection against diabetes-induced retinopathy. Genes expressing ACE2 and Ang-(1-7) were cloned in AAV vector. The effects of ocular AAV-ACE2/Ang-(1-7) gene transfer on DR in diabetic eNOS(-/-) mice and Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were examined. Diabetes was associated with approximately tenfold and greater than threefold increases in the ratios of ACE/ACE2 and AT1R/Mas mRNA levels in the retina respectively. Intraocular administration of AAV-ACE2/Ang-(1-7) resulted in significant reduction in diabetes-induced retinal vascular leakage, acellular capillaries, infiltrating inflammatory cells and oxidative damage in both diabetic mice and rats. Our results demonstrate that DR is associated with impaired balance of retinal RAS. Increased expression of ACE2/Ang-(1-7) overcomes this imbalance and confers protection against DR. Thus, strategies enhancing the protective ACE2/Ang-(1-7) axis of RAS in the eye could serve as a novel therapeutic target for DR.",

More than 750 patients would have experienced the primary outcome during this period. The first secondary outcome is death from any cause or hospitalization for a cardiovascular reason. Deaths and hospitalizations are being identified using the Scottish National Health Service electronic patient record-linkage system (hence the delay between the end of follow-up and database lock).", 
    "1110": "This trial is powered to provide a robust evaluation of the effect of pharmacist-led treatment optimization in patients with systolic HF in primary care."
