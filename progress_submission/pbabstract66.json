In 1K-1C hypertension, cardiac mass and arterial pressure were reduced to a similar extent by enalapril and losartan. In ANGII hypertension, enalapril and losartan blunted the increase in cardiac mass whereas losartan but not enalapril prevented the development of hypertension. The cardioprotective effect of enalapril was attenuated by concomitant blockade of bradykinin receptors (Hoe140: 300 micrograms/kg/24h) in both models. The beneficial influence of enalapril on cardiac mass appears to be independent of its effect on blood pressure and ANGII generation and seems partly mediated by endogenous bradykinin in these high ANGII models of hypertension.", 
    "1": "A blockade of the hemodynamic and tissue effects of angiotensin II (Ang II) more complete than that presently achieved with usual daily doses of angiotensin coverting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or type 1 Ang II receptor antagonists has potential advantages and risks. Therefore, it is worthwhile to investigate the biological and the hemodynamic effects of the simultaneous blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) at the two sites where it can be currently achieved, ACE and type 1 Ang II receptors. To investigate this issue, 2 double-blind randomized crossover studies were performed in a model of mild sodium depletion in normotensive volunteers. They ingested single oral doses of captopril 50 mg, losartan 50 mg, their combination or matched placebos, and in a second study, single oral doses of enalapril 10 mg, enalapril 20 mg and the combination of losartan 50 mg with enalapril 10 mg. The combination of captopril 50 mg and losartan 50 mg had additive effects on blood pressure fall and renin release in sodium-depleted normotensive subjects. When compared to enalapril 10 mg and the doubling of its dose, the combination of losartan 50 mg and enalapril 10 mg significantly increased both the area under the time curve of mean blood pressure fall and plasma active renin levels. It did not further decrease plasma aldosterone levels. The conclusion is that a more complete blockade of the RAS can be achieved by concomitant administration of a type 1 Ang II receptor antagonist and an ACE inhibitor.", 
    "2": "This study examined the possible contribution of the brain renin-angiotensin system on the sympathetic activation induced by hypoxia in conscious rabbits. Blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR) and renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) were recorded under conditions of normoxia and hypoxia (10% O2 + 3% CO2) before and after fourth ventricular administration of either losartan (10 micrograms in 25 microliters), enalaprilat (500 ng in 25 microliters) or Ringer's (25 microliters). Hypoxia increased the RSNA by 113% and slightly decreased HR without changing BP. It also increased the variability of BP or HR in the 0.2-0.4 Hz frequency domain. Losartan and enalaprilat did not change the resting BP or HR but elevated the RSNA increase seen during hypoxia. Our results suggest that central angiotensin is involved in mediating response to chemoreceptor activation.", 
    "3": "Cerebrovascular disease and high blood pressure both appear to increase the risk of vascular dementia. PROGRESS aims to investigate whether blood pressure lowering with an angiotensin coverting enzyme inhibitor-based regimen will reduce the risk of cognitive impairment in patients with a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack. A total of at least 6000 patients will be randomised to receive perindopril (+/- indapamide) or matching placebo(s), with treatment and follow-up scheduled to continue for at least 4 years. Substudies will investigate the effects of treatment on cognitive decline in subgroups defined by apo-E genotype and on white matter lesions assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. Final results from the study should be available in 2001.", 
    "4": "The Second Australian National Blood Pressure Study (ANBP2) is a comparative outcome trial being conducted in general practices throughout Australia of ACE inhibitor- and diuretic-based treatment in 6000 hypertensive patients aged 65-84 years. The study is using a prospective randomised open-label design with blinding of endpoint assessments. The primary objective is to determine whether there is any difference in total cardiovascular events (fatal and non-fatal) over a five year treatment period between the two treatment regimens. Eligible hypertensive patients (average sitting blood pressure at the 2nd and 3rd screening visits > 160 mm Hg systolic and/or > 90 mm Hg diastolic) may be either untreated or previously treated and should have no history of recent cardiovascular morbidity or serious intercurrent illness. Patients are randomised to one of the treatment arms with randomisation stratified for practice and for age. Following randomisation each patient's blood pressure is managed by his/her general practitioner according to guidelines relevant to each treatment arm. Over 700 patients have now been randomised with recruitment intended to be complete by the end of 1997.", 
    "5": "Hypertension is commonly associated with diabetes and may represent either a manifestation or a cause of diabetic vascular injury. The following series of studies have explored the role of hypertension in accelerating diabetic microvascular injury. In addition, the role of various classes of antihypertensive agents in preventing or reversing diabetic vascular abnormalities in the presence and absence of systemic hypertension was assessed in both the experimental and clinical context. The induction of streptozotocin diabetes in SHR leads to accelerated development of nephropathy as assessed by both functional and structural parameters. ACE inhibitors but not dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers favourably influence the progression of experimental diabetic nephropathy even in the setting of a normal blood pressure. More recent studies have shown that the trophic changes in the mesenteric arteries from diabetic rats are also attenuated by ACE inhibition. Preliminary results from the Melbourne Diabetic Nephropathy Study Group suggest that the ACE inhibitor, perindopril, is more effective than the dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, nifedipine, in retarding the rise in urinary albumin excretion in normotensive insulin and noninsulin dependent diabetic patients with microalbuminuria. In conclusion, ACE inhibitors appear to be the drugs of choice in prevention and treatment of diabetic renal disease and may also act as protective agents at other sites of vascular injury.", 
    "6": "The prevalence of microalbuminuria in patients with essential hypertension ranges between 10 and 25%. The level of albuminuria is highly correlated with arterial pressure and more closely ambulatory arterial pressure. The interaction between albuminuria and arterial pressure is enhanced by overweight and smoking. The renal mechanisms of microalbuminuria are not well elucidated; however, an increase in filtration fraction suggestive of intraglomerular hypertension was observed in patients with hyperfiltration. The significance of microalbuminuria as a marker of cardiovascular risk or hypertensive renal damage needs to be confirmed through long-term follow-up studies. Antihypertensive treatment has variable influence on albuminuria; and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and to a lesser extent other agents, tend to partially correct this abnormality.", 
    "7": "To compare the effects of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor on circulating and tissue renin-angiotensin system (RAS), we measured different RAS parameters during the first day of treatment (Day1) as well as after two weeks of treatment (Day14). Ramipril was given orally once daily to adult male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Renin activity (RA), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity and levels of angiotensin I (ang I) and angiotensin II (ang II) in the plasma, renal cortex and renal medulla were assessed at Day1 and Day14 of the treatment. In the plasma, both RA and ang I increased 10 to 15 fold one to four hours after acute as well as at Day14 of ramipril treatment and then returned to basal values within 24 hours. Plasma ang II levels were not significantly decreased at Day1 or Day14. The decrease in the ang II/ang I ratio suggested a sustained inhibition of plasma ACE at Day14. In the renal cortex and medulla, a clearly different pattern was observed: in ramipril treated rats, RA in the renal cortex and medulla did not change at Day1 but at Day14 we observed a slight and sustained increase in RA. Despite very high basal levels of RA, ang I levels in the renal cortex were comparable to those in the plasma. The ang I level increased only one-fold one hour after ramipril intake at Day1 and Day14. This suggests that angiotensinogen may have a limiting role in the synthesis of ang I in the kidney. Ang II levels were slightly higher in the renal cortex and medulla than in the plasma suggesting local synthesis of the peptide. In the kidney, ang II levels decreased one and four hours after the acute or prolonged ramipril treatment and the ang II/ang I ratio was reduced at the same time. Our results show that the responses of the plasma and kidney components of the RAS to ACE inhibition are different in the plasma and the kidney suggesting that the circulating and tissue RAS are at least in part independent.", 
    "8": "The supramolecular structure of oligomeric enzymes can be specifically regulated by changing the size of an inner cavity of Aerosol OT reversed micelles in octane. Both D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) reveal an ability to exist and function in monomeric, dimeric and tetrameric forms (homooligomers). Various heterooligomeric complexes, in particular, GAPDH monomer--LDH monomer, GAPDH dimer--LDH tetramer were detected in reversed micelles.", 
    "9": "A gel penetration technique, that measures the dilution undergone by protein equilibrium on a short tightly packed gel column, has been employed to determine the molecular masses of aldolase (160 kDa), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH; 145 kDa) in the absence and presence of each other and of other proteins. The dilution factor (concentration of protein applied/concentration of protein after equilibration) was found to be inversely related to the molecular mass of the protein. In equimolar mixtures of aldolase and GPDH, 0.5-2.5 microM each, the two enzymes exhibited a common molecular mass value of 309-316 kDa. These enzymes did not undergo any self association or disassociation in this concentration range. Moreover, their molecular masses were unaffected by the presence of other proteins tested. When the concentration of one of these enzymes (aldolase or GPDH) was held constant and that of the other varied, the dilution factor of the former was decreased as the concentration of the latter was increased until it corresponded to a molecular mass of ca. 310 kDa at equimolar concentrations of the two enzymes. Further increase in the concentration of the variable enzyme had no effect. It has been suggested that aldolase and GPDH form a 1:1 complex of dissociation constant equal to or less than 5 x 10(-8) M. The complex was found to dissociate in the presence of KCl, (NH4)2SO4, ATP and NADH whereas its formation was favoured by fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, NAD+, ADP, AMP and phosphate ions.", 
    "10": "The occurrence of angiotensin converting enzyme (EC 3.4.15.1; ACE) was demonstrated for the first time in serum of newt (Triturus carnifex) and frog (Rana esculenta). The enzymatic activity was evidenced following hydrolysis of N-[3-(2-furyl) acryloyl]L-phenylalanyl glycyl glycine (FAPGG), a synthetic substrate of ACE. The serum enzyme liberated N-[3-(2-furyl) acryloyl]L-phenylalanine (FAP) from FAPGG. The properties of the amphibian serum enzymes were compared with those of swine. The amphibian serum FAPGG hydrolysing activities were inhibited by typical ACE inhibitors, captopril and lisinopril. The optimum of pH was 8.3 at 10 and 37 degrees C and the temperature optimum was 45 degrees C. The values were similar to those of swine serum. The FAPGG Michaelis-Menten constants (K(m)) at 37 degrees C of amphibian serum enzymes (0.337 mM and 0.282 mM for frog and newt, respectively) were lower than that of swine (1.305 mM), but close to human serum enzyme. The K(m) values obtained at 10 degrees C were lower than those at 37 degrees C (0.152, 0.086, and 1.029 mM for frog, newt, and swine serum, respectively). Amphibian sera hydrolysed bullfrog synthetic angiotensin I to produce angiotensin II. Captopril (50 microM) inhibited the production of angiotensin II.",

    "13": "The mean dose of metoprolol was 135 mg.day-1 and of captopril 98 mg.day-1. After treatment there was a significant reduction in left ventricular filling pressure both at rest (from 16 to 12 mmHg) and during exercise (from 27 to 20 mmHg) in the metoprolol group. In the captopril group a significant reduction was seen only during exercise (25 to 20 mmHg), compared to baseline. The stroke volume increased significantly after 3 months of therapy in the metoprolol group, both at rest (53 to 70 ml) and during exercise (56 to 79 ml). In the captopril group the increase reached significance only during exercise (72 to 79 ml). Cardiac output was maintained in both groups.", 
    "14": "There were positive effects on left ventricular function in the metoprolol group as well as in the captopril group. Metoprolol reduced left ventricular filling pressure at rest and increased stroke volume both at rest and during exercise significantly more than captopril.", 
    "15": "Both the density and level of mRNA encoding insulin receptors in the kidney are inversely related to the dietary sodium content, suggesting a feedback mechanism that limits the insulin-induced sodium retention when extracellular fluid volume is expanded. Because angiotensin II affects tissue sensitivity to insulin in humans, we investigated whether angiotensin II affects insulin receptor binding and mRNA levels in the kidney, liver, and renal arteries of normal rats and rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus. Non-diabetic and diabetic rats were infused for 7 days with either vehicle or angiotensin II at a rate of 200 ng. kg-1. min-1. In a separate experiment, normal rats were treated with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (captopril, 100 mg/dl in the drinking water) or vehicle for 7 days. Regional analysis of insulin receptor binding in the kidney and renal arteries was performed by an in situ technique using computerized microdensitometry and emulsion autoradiography. Insulin receptor mRNA levels were determined in renal and hepatic tissue by Northern blot hybridization and normalized with 28S rRNA. No differences in blood pressure were observed among diabetic and non-diabetic rats infused with either vehicle or angiotensin II, whereas captopril-treated rats had significantly lower blood pressure levels than their respective controls. Angiotensin II significantly decreased plasma renin concentration in both non-diabetic and diabetic rats. Insulin receptor number was significantly greater in the renal cortex of diabetic rats than in non-diabetics, whereas no significant differences were found in the outer medulla, inner medulla, or renal arteries. Angiotensin II infusion did not affect either the number or affinity of insulin receptors in any of the renal regions studied. Insulin receptor mRNA levels were significantly greater in the kidney and liver of diabetic rats than in non-diabetics and were not affected by angiotensin II infusion. Similar to angiotensin II infusion, captopril treatment did not affect either renal insulin receptor binding or mRNA levels. Thus, diabetic rats have increased insulin receptor binding and mRNA levels in comparison to non-diabetic rats. Angiotensin II infusion and captopril treatment do not affect insulin receptor binding and mRNA levels in the kidney, arguing against a role for this peptide in the modulation of renal sensitivity to insulin.", 
    "16": "Previous studies in heart failure (CHF) after temporary diuretic withdrawal have suggested that perindopril is associated with no first dose hypotension in comparison with other ACE inhibitors (ACEI) or placebo.

Baseline biochemical, hormonal (ACE, Ang I, Ang II), isotopic renal function (GFR, ERPF, ECFV), pretreatment diuretic dose and heart failure scores were similar between groups. Concomitant cardiac treatments remained unchanged and diuretic withdrawal was not used to introduce treatment.",

Isotopic renal function was unaffected by either treatment.", 
    "19": "At this dose (2-4 mg orally) chronic perindopril therapy has no significant effect on blood pressure or renal function. Sustained neurohormonal suppression of ACE and AII occurred without evidence of AII reactivation. A lack of effect on BP at these doses may make perindopril suitable for study in unstable patients with acute HF or useful in those patients where there are concerns over ACEI induced hypotension.", 
    "20": "Heart disease is a common cause of morbidity in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. The management of heart disease in these patients requires a multidimensional approach to the management of heart failure, coronary disease, and arrhythmias, and to risk factors such as hypertension, anemia, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and electrolyte/acid-base disturbances. Coronary artery disease management includes use of antianginal drugs and revascularization of coronary arteries with angioplasty +/- stent placement or coronary artery bypass grafting. The long-term outcomes of these procedures need to be assessed and improved. Hypertension occupies a major role in the pathogenesis of heart disease in ESRD, and early and adequate control of hypertension is likely to have a major impact on the progression of cardiac disease. This entails the achievement of optimal volume status, combined with the appropriate use of antihypertensive agents such as calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, vasodilators, alpha-blockers, and central sympatholytic drugs. In ESRD patients, specific dialysis-related complications such as intradialytic hypotension and pericardial effusion may have additional effects on cardiac function and require attention. The choice of dialysate composition and membrane may influence clinical outcomes with specific effects on cardiac performance.", 
    "21": "A local renin-angiotensin system in the heart is often invoked to explain the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors in heart failure. The heart, however, produces little or no renin under normal conditions.", 
    "22": "We compared the cardiac tissue levels of renin-angiotensin system components in 10 potential heart donors who died of noncardiac disorders and 10 subjects with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) who underwent cardiac transplantation. Cardiac levels of renin and prorenin in DCM patients were higher than in the donors. The cardiac and plasma levels of renin in DCM were positively correlated, and extrapolation of the regression line to normal plasma levels yielded a tissue level close to that measured in the donor hearts. The cardiac tissue-to-plasma concentration (T/P) ratios for renin and prorenin were threefold the ratio for albumin, which indicates that the tissue levels were too high to be accounted for by admixture with blood and diffusion into the interstitial fluid. Cell membranes from porcine cardiac tissue bound porcine renin with high affinity. The T/P ratio for ACE, which is membrane bound, was fivefold the ratio for albumin. Cardiac angiotensinogen was lower in DCM patients than in the donors, and its T/P ratio was half that for albumin, which is compatible with substrate consumption by cardiac renin.", 
    "23": "These data in patients with heart failure support the concept of local angiotensin production in the heart by renin that is taken up from the circulation. Membrane binding may be part of the uptake process.", 
    "24": "ACE inhibitors are widely used in treating hypertension and heart failure, but the sites and mechanisms of ACE inhibition in human blood vessels are not understood. The present study was undertaken to assess the sites and extent of in vivo inhibition of ACE by long-term perindopril treatment in different layers of the internal mammary artery in patients with ischemic heart disease.", 
    "25": "Sixteen patients with ischemic heart disease were treated either with perindopril (4 mg/d PO) for up to 36 days before surgery (n = 9) or without the inhibitor as control subjects (n = 7). The segments of the internal mammary artery were collected for measurement of vascular free and total ACE by quantitative in vitro autoradiography with 125I-351A binding. The patients treated with perindopril had lower plasma ACE (P < .001) and plasma angiotensin (Ang) II-to-Ang I ratio (P < .05). In the internal mammary artery, free ACE was similarly inhibited by perindopril in the endothelium (P < .05) and adventitia (P < .05), and the free ACE-to-total ACE ratio, an index of ACE inhibition, was markedly decreased by perindopril in parallel in the endothelium (P < .001) and adventitia (P < .001). Moreover, plasma ACE correlated highly with vascular ACE in the endothelium (r = .85, P < .001) or adventitia (r = .78, P < .001), and mean arterial pressure correlated significantly with free ACE in the endothelium (r = .52, P < .05) or adventitia (r = .53, P < .05) and with the plasma Ang II-to-Ang I ratio (r = .53, P < .05). Light microscopic autoradiographs of 125I-351A binding revealed a marked inhibition of ACE by perindopril in both layers of the vascular wall.", 
    "26": "The present demonstrates that long-term administration of perindopril potently inhibits both endothelial and adventitial ACE to a comparable degree in the human internal mammary artery. These results indicate that perindopril effectively penetrates the vascular wall to inhibit ACE in the adventitia, thus providing evidence that perindopril may be beneficial in inhibiting both circulating Ang II and its local formation in the vascular wall.", 
    "27": "In humans with coronary artery disease, ACE inhibition attenuates coronary sympathetic vasoconstriction. Whether this is due to removal of angiotensin (Ang) II production or to a reduced bradykinin breakdown, however, is unknown.", 
    "28": "In eight normotensive patients with angiographic evidence of mild left coronary artery lesions (< or = 50%), mean arterial pressure (MAP, intra-arterial catheter), heart rate (HR, ECG lead), coronary sinus blood flow (CBF, thermodilution method), and coronary vascular resistance (CVR, ratio between MAP and CBF) were measured before and during a 15-minute left intracoronary infusion of Ang II at a dose that had no direct coronary or systemic vasomotor effects. The same measurements were made before and during a 15-minute infusion of saline. A 2-minute cold pressor test (CPT) and a 45-second diving were performed at the end of either infusion period. These maneuvers were used because their coronary vasomotor effects are abolished by phentolamine and thus depend on sympathetic activation. During saline infusion, both CPT and diving caused a marked increase in MAP. HR increased with CPT and fell with diving. CBF increased in parallel to the MAP increase, with little change in CVR. The MAP and HR responses were similar during Ang II infusion, which, however, caused either no change or a reduction in CBF with a consequent marked increase in CVR with both CPT and diving. In four additional patients, the diameter of the stenotic vessels remained unchanged during the CPT performed under saline and Ang II infusion.", 
    "29": "Ang II markedly enhances sympathetic influences on coronary circulation in humans, presumably by acting at the arteriolar level. This may explain the blunting effect of ACE inhibition on sympathetic coronary vasoconstriction in patients with coronary artery disease.", 
    "30": "Left ventricular remodeling is an important sequela of myocardial infarction (MI). Although remodeling occurs soon after MI, the effect of early left ventricular dilatation on outcome is not established and may be useful for early risk stratification. We assessed whether end-systolic volume index (ESVI) at 90 to 180 minutes into thrombolytic therapy for MI is associated with adverse outcomes.", 
    "31": "In the Global Utilization of Streptokinase and t-PA for Occluded Coronary Arteries (GUSTO)-I study, 41021 patients with evolving MI received one of four thrombolytic regimens. At 90 or 180 minutes into reperfusion therapy, 1300 patients underwent left ventriculography. ESVI was measured and correlated with adverse outcomes: 30-day and 1-year mortality and in-hospital congestive heart failure, shock, and reinfarction. Clinical variables were also tested in a stepwise logistic regression analysis to determine predictors of left ventricular dilatation. ESVI was directly related to all adverse outcomes with univariate analysis. ESVI of > or = 40 mL/m2 was independently associated with mortality (adjusted odds ratio [95% confidence interval]: 30-day, 3.4 [2.0 to 5.9]; 1-year, 4:1 [2.6 to 6.2], both P < .001). Male sex, prior angina or MI, weight of < 70 kg, heart rate of > or = 80 bpm, systolic blood pressure of < 110 mm.Hg, and anterior infarction were independent predictors of an ESVI of > or = 40 mL/m2.", 
    "32": "Left ventricular ESVI early into reperfusion therapy for MI strongly predicts adverse outcomes, including early and late mortality. The study establishes the role of very early left ventricular dilatation on outcome in MI and may be useful in identifying high-risk patients who might benefit from aggressive treatment, including the early use of ACE inhibitors.", 
    "33": "The effects of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) administration on blood pressure and urinary albumin excretion were studied in normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY), in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), and in SHR rats treated with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (SHR-ACEi). Rats were housed in metabolic cages and treated with rHuEPO (150 U/kg body weight [bw] three times a week) for 6 weeks. Control animals received the vehicle only (0.25 mL of physiological saline). An angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor was administered in the drinking water for 6 weeks (spirapril 5 mg/kg bw). Systolic blood pressure (SBP), and 24 h urinary albumin excretion (UAE) were measured once a week. No significant differences in SBP were observed between rHuEPO and vehicle-treated normotensive animals at the end of the treatment (171.9 +/- 4.9 v 172.1 +/- 5.6 mm Hg, respectively). After 6 weeks, SBP was significantly higher in SHR and SHR-ACEi groups treated with rHuEPO than in control groups (239.8 +/- 7.3 and 243.0 +/- 7.3 mm Hg v 218.1 +/- 6.0 and 187.9 +/- 4.6 mm Hg, respectively); UAE was significantly higher in groups treated with rHuEPO than in control groups (WKY: 265.9 +/- 19.5 v 127.0 +/- 12.3 microg/100 g bw, SHR: 1668.4 +/- 564.6 v 234.8 +/- 22.9 microg/100 g bw, and SHR-ACEi: 1522.7 +/- 448.3 v 143.0 +/- 18.9 microg/100 g bw, respectively). We concluded that erythropoietin treatment causes an increase in arterial pressure in SHR only, and an increase in UAE in both normotensive and hypertensive rats. The albuminuric effect was not entirely dependent on increased blood pressure. The treatment with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor did not modify either the proteinuric or the pressor effects.", 
    "34": "A multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with multifactorial design was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the calcium-channel blocker diltiazem, in a sustained release preparation, and the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, lisinopril, in the treatment of elderly Chinese patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. In addition to the hypotensive effects of combinations of both drugs compared with monotherapy, all given once daily, the effect on quality of life was also evaluated. This study consisted of a 3 x 2 multifactorial design in which 156 women and men with a sitting diastolic pressure of between 95 mm Hg and 114 mm Hg, after a 4-week placebo washout phase, were randomized to one of six treatment groups for 12 weeks of active treatment. Monotherapy with diltiazem 120 or 240 mg produced increasing reductions of systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Compared with placebo, lisinopril 10 mg had an effect intermediate between the diltiazem doses. The combinations of diltiazem 240 mg + lisinopril 10 mg and diltiazem 120 mg + lisinopril 10 mg showed increased efficacy in reducing systolic and diastolic blood pressure compared to these drug doses used in monotherapy, but the effect of the combinations was less than predicted by an additive model. Although the total number of other adverse events reported was similar for all active treatment groups compared to placebo, lisinopril-induced cough was common with an incidence of 31% after rechallenge. Premature drug withdrawal was necessary in four of 78 patients receiving lisinopril, due to intractable cough. The combination of diltiazem 240 mg and lisinopril 10 mg was significantly more effective at reducing blood pressure than either drug alone; this additive effect did not result in a higher rate of adverse effects or impairment of quality of life. Thus, combination therapy with these agents was well tolerated and resulted in increased efficacy in these elderly patients.", 
    "35": "The treatment of hypertension mainly with diuretics and beta blockers reduces cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, largely due to a decreased incidence of stroke, whereas the beneficial effects of antihypertensive therapy on the occurrence of coronary events have been less than expected from epidemiological studies. Furthermore, treated hypertensive patients still have a higher cardiovascular complication rate, compared with matched normotensives. This is particularly evident in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), a major independent risk indicator for cardiovascular disease. In addition to elevating blood pressure, angiotensin II (A-II) exerts an important influence on cardiac structure and function, stimulating cell proliferation and growth. Thus, to further reduce morbidity and mortality when treating hypertensive patients, it may be important to effectively block the effects of A-II. This can be achieved directly at the A-II receptor level by losartan, the first of a new class of antihypertensive agents. It therefore seems pertinent to investigate whether selective A-II receptor blockade with losartan not only lowers blood pressure but also reduces LVH more effectively than current therapy, and thus improves prognosis. The Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction (LIFE) in Hypertension study is a double-blind, prospective, parallel group study designed to compare the effects of losartan with those of the beta-blocker atenolol on the reduction of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in approximately 8,300 hypertensive patients (initial sitting diastolic blood pressure 95 to 115 mm Hg or systolic blood pressure 160 to 200 mm Hg) with electrocardiographically documented LVH. The study, which will continue for at least 4 years and until 1,040 patients experience one primary endpoint, has been designed with a statistical power that will detect a difference of at least 15% between groups in the incidence of combined cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. It is also the first prospective study with adequate power to link reversal of LVH to reduction in major cardiovascular events. The rationale of the study, which will involve more than 800 clinical centers in Scandinavia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, is discussed, and the major features of its design and general organization are described.

This study examined the effect of initial drug choice and comorbidity on medication compliance. We conducted a retrospective follow-up of 8643 outpatients aged 65 to 99 with newly prescribed antihypertensive therapy (AHT) from 1982 to 1988 in the New Jersey Medicaid and Medicare programs. Compliance was measured in terms of the number of days in which AHT was available to the patient during the 12 months following the initiation of therapy. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the outcome of good compliance (> or =80%) were calculated. In a logistic regression model, good compliance (> or =80%) was significantly associated with use of newer agents such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.6 to 2.2) and calcium channel blockers (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.5 to 2.1) as compared to thiazides, the presence of comorbid cardiac disease (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.2), and multiple physician visits (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.8 to 2.5). Good compliance was inversely associated with use of multiple pharmacies (OR 0.4, 95% CI 0.4 to 0.5) and number of medications prescribed overall (OR 0.8, 95% CI 0.7 to 0.9). Drug choice, comorbidity, and health services utilization were significantly associated with AHT compliance and represent important considerations in the management of high blood pressure. Noncompliance may be an important cause of treatment failure in elderly hypertensives.", 
    "37": "Hypertensive patients have an excess of other cardiovascular risk factors. Moreover, traditional therapy based on diuretics and beta-blockers may aggravate these risk factors. Therefore, attention must be given to the identification of all pertinent risk factors and their amelioration by appropriate therapy. Such therapy must include lifestyle changes including cessation of smoking, reduction of obesity, moderation of sodium intake and alcohol consumption, and increased physical activity. When antihypertensive drugs are chosen, consideration should be given to their potential influences, either negative or positive, on other cardiovascular risk factors. In particular, the adverse effects of diuretics and beta-blockers on lipids and insulin sensitivity may preclude their use. alpha-Blockers and ACE inhibitors may have beneficial effects on these metabolic indices. Calcium antagonists are neutral in most regards. Whatever agents are chosen, the use of low doses in combination is being increasingly recognized as a better way to achieve the desired antihypertensive efficacy while minimizing adverse effects. As has been noted in the other papers in this supplement, the combination of an ACE inhibitor and a calcium antagonist is particularly attractive, not only to treat hypertension, but also to ameliorate other cardiovascular risk factors.", 
    "38": "Diabetic nephropathy is a major cause of illness and premature death in diabetic patients, largely through accompanying cardiovascular disease and end-stage renal failure. Proteinuria heralds the clinical nephropathy, and the worsening of proteinuria parallels the progression of renal disease towards chronic renal failure. A large body of evidence has accumulated that emphasizes the role of elevated blood pressure in the progression of renal disease, as well as the clear benefit of antihypertensive treatment. However, the choice of antihypertensive drug to protect renal function was less clear in the past. In earlier studies, a reduction in the rate of progressive renal failure in hypertensive subjects has been shown with diuretics, beta-blockers, and vasodilators. However, there is now increasing evidence that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and some calcium antagonists produce a more beneficial effect on nephropathy in terms of reducing proteinuria and slowing progression to renal failure. These drugs are attributed nephroprotective capacity beyond their systemic blood pressure lowering effects, and initial clinical trials with combinations have revealed additive nephroprotective effects. Finally, ACE-inhibitors and calcium antagonists have no adverse effects on glycemic control or lipid levels and may even improve insulin sensitivity. This further promotes these antihypertensives to first-line drugs when treating subjects at risk of metabolic disorders or people with diabetes.", 
    "39": "In the past few years, the combination of two antihypertensive drugs has become a popular approach to hypertension treatment, because this procedure allows one to obtain satisfactory blood pressure control when monotherapy is partially ineffective and also to improve a patient's adherence to the therapeutic regimen, thereby enhancing the tolerance/effectiveness ratio of the treatment. This paper will briefly review the theoretical background and the requirements for an effective combination treatment. It will also discuss the results of the VeraTran Study, a multicenter study performed according to a double-blind parallel group design and aimed at assessing the antihypertensive efficacy of the fixed combination verapamil slow release (SR) and trandolapril, administered for 8 weeks, on clinic and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure. The results of the study demonstrate that the fixed combination of a calcium antagonist and an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor allows one to obtain an effective and balanced blood pressure control throughout the 24 h.", 
    "40": "Control of hypertension and treatment of concomitant pathophysiologic conditions require use of multiple drugs. Unfortunately, most studies regarding hypertensive disease have focused on monotherapy. Thus, our knowledge of combination therapy in the treatment of hypertension is, to a great extent, extrapolation from monotherapy. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in combination with calcium antagonists should be particularly efficacious in reducing left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Drug classes that either stimulate the renin-angiotensin system or the sympathetic nervous system are less likely to reduce LVH and should be avoided. In hypertensive patients with congestive heart failure, amlodipine should be added to triple therapy with an ACE inhibitor, whereas in the postmyocardial ischemia patient, verapamil may exert some additional beneficial effects with regard to reinfarction rates. Given that two drugs when used separately are beneficial in a disorder does not necessarily mean that their combination is equally or even more beneficial. Thus, combination therapy should primarily be used for lowering arterial pressure and only secondarily to possibly improve concomitant pathophysiologic conditions associated with hypertensive heart disease.", 
    "41": "We assessed the efficacy of monotherapy with trandolapril, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, and of verapamil slow-release (SR), a calcium antagonist, each in a range of three doses as monotherapy, and in the nine possible combinations of therapy in patients with stage I to III diastolic hypertension. After 4 weeks of single-blind placebo, 746 patients in 39 study centers were randomized to one of the 16 double-blind treatments for 6 weeks (placebo; verapamil SR monotherapy 120, 180, or 240 mg; trandolapril monotherapy 0.5, 2, or 8 mg; and trandolapril/verapamil SR combinations 0.5/120, 0.5/180, 0.5/240, 2/120, 2/180, 2/240, 8/120, 8/180, or 8/240 mg. Both mono- and combination therapies achieved the primary efficacy parameters: lowered supine diastolic blood pressure (at trough) more than placebo, P < .01 (except 0.5 mg trandolapril, 0.5/180 and 2/120 combinations, P < .05, and the 120 mg verapamil SR, P = NS). The therapies yielded a trough to peak ratio of >0.52 and had higher percentages of responders as compared with placebo (P < .01, < .05). Supine systolic blood pressures were lowered more by combination therapy than the respective monotherapies, P < .05, P < .01, except the 8/120 combination. Combination therapy was more effective than monotherapy for sitting diastolic blood pressure, P < .05. The percentage of patients with adverse reactions were similar for mono- and combination therapy. Trandolapril had a greater \"apparent\" incremental effect on the systolic blood pressure reductions than verapamil SR.", 
    "42": "Because obesity-associated hypertension has unique hemodynamic and hormonal profiles, certain classes of antihypertensive agents may be more effective than others as monotherapy. Thus, we compared the efficacy and safety of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril and the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide in a 12-week, multicenter, double-blind trial in 232 obese patients with hypertension. Patients with an office diastolic pressure between 90 and 109 mm Hg were randomized to treatment with daily doses of lisinopril (10, 20, or 40 mg), hydrochlorothiazide (12.5, 25, or 50 mg), or placebo. Mean body mass indexes were similar for all patients. At week 12, lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide effectively lowered office diastolic (-8.3 and -7.7 versus -3.3 mm Hg, respectively; P<.005) and systolic (-9.2 and -10.0 versus -4.6 mm Hg, respectively; P<.05) pressures compared with placebo. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring confirmed that lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide effectively lowered 24-hour blood pressure compared with placebo (P<.001). Significant dose-response differences were observed between treatments. Sixty percent of patients treated with lisinopril had an office diastolic pressure <90 mm Hg compared with 43% of patients treated with hydrochlorothiazide (P<.05). Responses to therapies differed with both race and age. Neither treatment significantly affected insulin or lipid profiles; however, plasma glucose increased significantly after 12 weeks of hydrochlorothiazide therapy compared with lisinopril (+0.31 versus -0.21 mmol/L; P<.001). Hydrochlorothiazide also decreased serum potassium levels by 0.4 mmol/L from baseline. In conclusion, lisinopril was as effective as hydrochlorothiazide in treating obese patients with hypertension. Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may show greater efficacy as monotherapy at lower doses compared with thiazide diuretics, may have a more rapid rate of response, and may offer advantages in patients at high risk of metabolic disorders.", 
    "43": "Non-modulators are a subset of essential hypertensive individuals in whom renal hemodynamic and adrenal aldosterone responses to angiotensin II fail to modulate appropriately during high dietary salt intake. The main aim of this study was to investigate the familial aggregation of non-modulation and several erythrocyte Na+ transport systems in normotensive and hypertensive individuals as well as offspring of hypertensive parents. An additional aim was to evaluate the effect of treatment with enalapril on erythrocyte Na+ transport. We studied 15 normotensive subjects (6 males, 27+/-6 years), 14 untreated modulating essential hypertensive subjects (7 males, 38+/-7 years), 12 untreated non-modulating essential hypertensive subjects (7 males, 38+/-6 years), 14 modulating offspring of hypertensive parents (8 males, 25+/-6 years), and 14 non-modulating offspring of hypertensive parents (8 males, 26+/-4 years). Blood pressure was recorded with an oscillometric device and renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate by clearances of para-aminohippurate and inulin, respectively. Non-modulating subjects were identified as individuals who failed to increase effective renal plasma flow by 30% and decrease filtration fraction by at least 30% 10 days after changing from a low (20 mmol/d) to a high (250 mmol/d) sodium intake. Erythrocyte Na+ transport was characterized by measurements of the Na+-K+ pump, Na+-Li+ countertransport, Na+-K+-Cl- cotransport, passive Na+ permeability, and Na+ content. After the initial studies, hypertensive individuals were treated with enalapril (20 mg/d P.O.) for 6 months, after which erythrocyte Na+ transport measurements were again made. The main findings were that Na+-Li+ countertransport is increased in non-modulating hypertensive subjects and non-modulating offspring of hypertensive parents, that the increase in blood pressure in response to high salt intake is greater in non-modulating than modulating hypertensive subjects, and that enalapril decreases Na+-Li+ countertransport activity to normal in non-modulating hypertensive subjects. These findings provide support for a possible genetic role in the development of salt sensitivity and suggest that Na+-Li+ countertransport and non-modulation are related phenotypes.", 
    "44": "Angiotensin II (Ang II) is internalized by various cell types via receptor-mediated endocytosis. Little is known about the kinetics of this process in the whole animal and about the half-life of intact Ang II after its internalization. We measured the levels of 125I-Ang II and 125I-Ang I that were reached in various tissues and blood plasma during infusions of these peptides into the left cardiac ventricle of pigs. Steady-state concentrations of 125I-Ang II in skeletal muscle, heart, kidney, and adrenal were 8% to 41%, 64% to 150%, 340% to 550%, and 680% to 2100%, respectively, of the 125I-Ang II concentration in arterial blood plasma (ranges of six experiments). The tissue concentrations of 125I-Ang I were less than 5% of the arterial plasma concentrations. 125I-Ang II accumulation seen in heart, kidney, and adrenal was almost completely blocked by a specific Ang II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist. Steady-state concentrations of 125I-Ang II were reached within 30 to 60 minutes in the tissues and within 5 minutes in blood plasma. The in vivo half-life of intact 125I-Ang II in heart, kidney, and adrenal was approximately 15 minutes, compared with 0.5 minute in the circulation. Thus, Ang II, but not Ang I, from the circulation is accumulated by some tissues, and this is mediated by AT1 receptors. The time course of this process and the long half-life of the accumulated Ang II support the contention that this Ang II has been internalized after its binding to the AT1 receptor, so that it is protected from rapid degradation by endothelial peptidases. The results of this study are in agreement with growing evidence of an important physiological role for internalized Ang II.", 
    "45": "The potential role of endothelin-1 (ET-1) in essential hypertension in humans is still subject to debate. We recently reported strong sodium retention and renal vasoconstriction during pathophysiological increments in plasma ET-1. Apart from this vasoconstrictor action, ET-1 also has mitogenic properties that play a role in the pathophysiology of hypertension. On the other hand, some data refute an important role of ET-1 in hypertension. We therefore investigated in nine subjects with essential hypertension the constrictor actions of ET-1 by challenging these subjects with a systemic infusion of ET-1 (0.5 ng/kg per minute for 60 minutes, then 1.0 ng/kg per minute for 60 minutes, and finally 2.0 ng/kg per minute for 60 minutes). Furthermore, we studied whether these effects of ET-1 could be modulated by oral use of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril (20 mg BID) or the calcium channel blocker nifedipine (60 mg OD). ET-1 infusion increased plasma ET-1 levels from 2.5+/-0.4 to 11.6+/-1.0 pmol/L (P<.05). Blood pressure rose by approximately 10 mm Hg (P<.05). Cardiac index decreased by 21+/-22%, whereas calculated systemic vascular resistance increased by 27+/-6% (P<.05). Renal blood flow decreased from 1051+/-94 to 707+/-60 mL/min at the end of the ET-1 infusion (P<.05), and calculated renal vascular resistance increased from 118+/-19 to 189+/-19 mm Hg x min/L (P<.05). Sodium excretion decreased from 227+/-39 to 111+/-15 micromol/min (P<.05). Both enalapril and nifedipine treatment prevented the systemic effects of ET-1 infusion in these subjects. However, during enalapril treatment, despite renal predilatation, ET-1 reduced renal blood flow (from 1119+/-132 to 701+/-75 mL/min, P<.05) and increased renal vascular resistance (from 111+/-16 to 187+/-28 mm Hg x min/L, P<.05) to the same levels as during ET-1 infusion alone. Nifedipine pretreatment attenuated the ET-1-induced fall in renal blood flow (from 1088+/-93 to 907+/-68 mL/min) and increase in renal vascular resistance (from 105+/-9 to 133+/-10 mm Hg x min/L). Although neither drug modulated the antinatriuretic effect of ET-1, nifedipine increased basal sodium excretion (P<.05), which compensated for the decrease during ET-1 infusion. In conclusion, essential hypertensive subjects are sensitive to the vasoconstrictor effects of ET-1. Both enalapril and nifedipine can prevent the systemic effects of ET-1, but nifedipine seems more effective in attenuating the renal constrictor effects of ET-1.", 
    "46": "The mechanical and dielectric properties of three kinds of poly(lactic acid-coglycolic acid) (PLG) with different molecular weights and polydispersities fractioned by ultrafiltration were investigated by dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) and dielectric measurement. All samples showed typical behaviour of amorphous polymer under different fields. Two relaxation processes were found, a secondary relaxation in glassy state at low temperature and a glass transition relaxation. The molecular weights and polydispersities of PLGs influenced significantly both relaxation, especially the relaxation strength and location. The strength of secondary relaxation was reduced and the glass transition shifted to a higher temperature when the molecular weight of PLG increased and the polydispersity decreased. The shift of glass transition temperature (Tg) might decrease the motion of the macromolecules and resulted in a higher moduli of rubbery PLG at the temperature of the drug system (37 degrees C) and lowered the diffusivity of the drug in polymeric matrix and then the initial burst and fast diffusional release of captopril from commercial PLG were improved.", 
    "47": "Previous experiments indicated that the Na appetite of Na-deplete sheep is decreased by systemically administered captopril. The assumption that captopril does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier, lead to the conclusion that circulating ANG II acting in brain areas without a blood-brain barrier, i.e., circumventricular organs such as the subfornical organ or organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis, contributes to Na appetite induced by Na depletion. The present experiments investigated the possibility that systemically administered captopril does, in fact, cross the blood-brain-barrier and thereby influence brain angiotensin II formation and that brain angiotensin II contributes to Na depletion-induced Na appetite of sheep. The results showed that systemically administered captopril blocked water intake caused by intracerebroventricular infusion of angiotensin I, and that Na depletion induced Na appetite was not decreased by intracerebroventricular infusion of various antagonists of the renin-angiotensin system. Thus, the results suggest that although captopril crosses the blood-brain-barrier and can influence the formation of brain angiotensin II, brain angiotensin II is not involved in the Na appetite of Na-deplete sheep.",

Nineteen patients received additional treatment with enalapril, an ACE inhibitor, and 10 patients who were treated with conventional therapy alone were defined as a control group. Iodine-123-MIBG imaging and echocardiography were performed on all patients before treatment and repeated after 9.1 +/- 3.0 mo of treatment. Images were obtained 30 min and 4 hr after injection of 123I-MIBG, and a heart to mediastinum (H/M) ratio was defined to quantify cardiac 123I-MIBG uptake as a fraction of the mean counts per pixel in the heart divided by those in the mediastinum.

There was no fetal exposure to ACE inhibitors in the affected infants. Phenotypic similarities between these familial cases and those associated with ACE inhibition suggest an abnormality of the \"renin-angiotensin-aldosterone\" system (RAS).

Even though these two classes are efficacious, they are costly. Combined ACE inhibitor/CCB therapy (amlodipine-benazepril) was introduced in 1995. An analysis was done to assess the potential financial impact of substituting this agent for patients being treated with on ACE inhibitor/CCB combination. A pharmaceutical profile review of prescriptions during October 1995 was performed on 219 randomly selected patients enrolled in a Medicaid managed care program. Eighty-four profiles were analyzed; 24% of patients were on a combination ACE inhibitor/CCB regimen with an average monthly cost of $135. If the single agent amlodipine-benazepril with an average monthly cost of $45 (all strengths) was substituted, the savings would be considerable: $1080 per patient per year and $1,080,000 annualized for the calculated number of hypertensives on combination therapy in our network of 15,000 patients. Therapeutic substitution is one method of achieving cost containment in managed care. The cost differential between separately prescribed CCBs and ACE inhibitors and amlodipine-benazepril is significant. Compliance also should be enhanced as the patient would need to take only one pill daily. Once a patient has been maintained on a stable dose of a CCB/ACE inhibitor, substitution with amlodipine-benazepril should be considered.", 
    "66": "The evidence supporting the efficacy of digoxin in patients with heart failure who are in sinus rhythm is substantial. Digoxin improves hemodynamics, exercise capacity, symptoms, and quality of life and reduces hospitalizations. All of this is accomplished with a drug that is very inexpensive and can be given once daily. Its safety has been established through the DIG trial. Although digoxin does not decrease mortality beyond that of diuretics and ACE inhibitors, it does not increase mortality, unlike many positive inotropes. Furthermore, digoxin, in addition to ACE inhibitors and a diuretic, decreases the hospitalization rate due to worsening of heart failure. From a managed care perspective, as well as that of the patient, this is of enormous benefit. A pharmacoeconomic analysis estimated that continuation of digoxin in patients with stable congestive heart failure could save the healthcare system an estimated $ 400 million, based on costs from one hospital. The issue is not whether to use digoxin in these patients, but rather, how early to initiate therapy. From some of the recent data in patients with systolic dysfunction and mild heart failure, as well as knowledge of the neurohormonal activation that occurs early in these patients, it could be suggested that early use of neurohormonal modulators, including digoxin, would decrease the progression of heart failure. Thus, rather than waiting for symptoms despite optimal doses of an ACE inhibitor and diuretic, as suggested by the AHCPR practice guideline for heart failure, initiation of digoxin therapy in patients as early as NYHA class II at a dosage that will achieve a serum concentration of 1.0 ng/mL or less should occur. With the understanding of digoxin's effect on the neurohormonal systems, its role in patients with preserved systolic function needs to be reexplored. The debate can now focus on asymptomatic patients or those with preserved systolic function. Could these patients benefit from therapy with digoxin as well?",

However, medium (100 micrograms/kg/day) and high (1 mg/kg/day) doses reduced total cardiac and left ventricular masses to the same extent in spontaneously hypertensive rats, despite a much greater fall in arterial pressure with a high dose. Resting cardiac index, and myocardial and all other organ blood flows remained unchanged in both strains. When compared with Wistar Kyoto rats, coronary circulation was impaired in untreated spontaneously hypertensive rats (ie, reduced coronary flow and flow reserve and increased minimal coronary vascular resistance during dipyridamole infusion). This remained unchanged by ramipril. Furthermore, significant (and comparable) increases in cardiac index and myocardial blood flow and decreases in coronary vascular resistance were produced by maximal treadmill exercise in both strains. This also was unaffected by ramipril. These data showed that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition with suboptimal and optimal hypotensive doses of ramipril reversed left ventricular hypertrophy in spontaneously hypertensive rats, but coronary flow, flow reserve, and minimal coronary vascular resistance remained unchanged despite left ventricular hypertrophy reversal.",

    "75": "Steady-state captopril renography (SSCR) is an original technique for assessing the captopril-induced increase in technetium-99m mercaptoacetyltriglycine (99mTc-MAG3) mean parenchymal transit time (MPTT) in kidneys affected with functional renal artery stenosis (RAS). The steady-state parenchymal activity achieved by constant infusion of 99mTc-MAG3 is directly linked to the MPTT of the radiopharmaceutical. This steady-state parenchymal activity was continuously monitored from 15 min before to 60 min after a single dose of captopril in order to detect possible disruption of the steady state. SSCR was performed in 11 hypertensive patients with unilateral RAS and in two with RAS of a solitary kidney before renal revascularization (RR). In four of these patients, an additional SSCR was performed after RR. Of the ten patients whose hypertension was cured or improved by RR, one presented an uninterpretable SSCR and six presented a positive SSCR on the affected side. Control SSCR performed in four of these six patients was bilaterally negative. SSCR was also bilaterally negative in the three patients who showed no blood pressure response to RR. These preliminary results tend to indicate that, in spite of the stability of pre- and post-captopril hydration and data acquisition conditions allowed by this steady-state technique, the sensitivity is lower than expected. However, the reason for the false-negative results does not seem to be inherent to SSCR.", 
    "76": "Fosinopril is the prodrug of the active diacid ACE inhibitor fosinoprilat. In patients with heart failure, fosinopril reduces pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, mean arterial blood pressure, mean right atrial pressure and heart rate, and increases stroke volume index and cardiac index. The drug has compensatory dual elimination routes via renal and hepatic systems and accumulates to a lesser extent than enalapril and lisinopril in patients with chronic renal insufficiency with or without heart failure. Comparative studies of 3 or 6 months' duration with fosinopril 10 to 40 mg/day have demonstrated clinical efficacy significantly superior to that of placebo in patients with heart failure [mostly New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II or III]. Fosinopril treatment consistently increased exercise duration and improved heart failure symptoms in these patients. Significantly fewer fosinopril than placebo recipients withdrew or were hospitalised because of worsening heart failure. Additionally, significantly more fosinopril than placebo recipients showed improvement, and fewer patients had deteriorated, in terms of NYHA functional class. Fosinopril and enalapril showed similar clinical efficacy over 6 and 12 months' treatment in patients with NYHA functional class II to IV heart failure. As yet, there are no data showing a mortality benefit with fosinopril. Fosinopril was well tolerated in clinical trials in patients with heart failure. Dizziness (11.9 vs 5.4% for placebo), cough (9.7 vs 5.1%) and hypotension (4.4 vs 0.8%) were the most commonly reported adverse events. In 6- or 12-month comparative studies, fosinopril therapy was associated with a lower incidence of dizziness and hypotension, but a higher incidence of vertigo, than enalapril therapy. 0.8% of patients discontinued the drug because of cough, which occurred to a similar extent with fosinopril and enalapril. Thus, based on available clinical evidence, fosinopril is an effective and well tolerated option for the management of patients with heart failure. Although clinical data are limited, fosinopril may be especially useful in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.",

We performed a prospective, randomized, parallel study for 42 months, double blind for the first 12 months and single blind thereafter. Forty-three (21 lisinopril and 22 atenolol) hypertensive NIDDM patients with diabetic nephropathy were enrolled. Data from 36 patients (17 lisinopril and 19 atenolol, 60 +/- 7 years of age, 27 men) who completed at least 12 months of the study period are presented. At baseline, the two groups were comparable: glomerular filtration rate (51Cr-EDTA plasma clearance) was 75 +/- 6 and 74 +/- 8 ml x min(-1) x 1.73 m(-2), mean 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (A&D TM2420) was 110 +/- 3 and 114 +/- 2 mmHg, and 24-h urinary albumin excretion rate was 961 (range 331-5,727) and 1,578 (476-5,806) mg/24 h in the lisinopril and atenolol groups, respectively. The mean follow-up time was similar, 37 and 35 months in the lisinopril and atenolol groups, respectively. Mean ambulatory blood pressure was equally reduced in the two groups, 12 +/- 2 and 10 +/- 2 mmHg in the lisinopril and atenolol groups, respectively. Glomerular filtration rate declined in a biphasic manner with a faster initial (0 to 6 months) change of 1.25 +/- 0.49 and 0.81 +/- 0.29 ml x min(-1) x month(-1) followed by a slower sustained decline (6 to 42 months) of 0.59 +/- 0.10 and 0.54 +/- 0.13 ml x min(-1) x month(-1) in the lisinopril and atenolol groups, respectively. No significant differences were observed in either initial or sustained decline in glomerular filtration rate between the two groups. Urinary albumin excretion was reduced (% reduction of baseline) more in the lisinopril than in the atenolol group, at 55 (95% CI 29-72) and 15% (-13 to 34), respectively (P = 0.01). In conclusion, the relentless decline in kidney function characteristically found in hypertensive NIDDM patients with diabetic nephropathy can be reduced equally effectively by two antihypertensive treatments, the beta-blocker atenolol and the ACE inhibitor lisinopril.",

Whether this difference applies to progression of nondiabetic proteinuric nephropathies is not clear. The Ramipril Efficacy in Nephropathy study of chronic nondiabetic nephropathies aimed to address whether glomerular protein traffic influences renal-disease progression, and whether an ACE inhibitor was superior to conventional treatment, with the same blood-pressure control, in reducing proteinuria, limiting GFR decline, and preventing endstage renal disease.",

Data (at least three GFR measurements including baseline) were available for 56 ramipril-assigned patients and 61 placebo-assigned patients. The decline in GFR per month was significantly lower in the ramipril group than the placebo group (0.53 [0.08] vs 0.88 [0.13] mL/min, p = 0.03). Among the ramipril-assigned patients, percentage reduction in proteinuria was inversely correlated with decline in GFR (p = 0.035) and predicted the reduction in risk of doubling of baseline creatinine or endstage renal failure (18 ramipril vs 40 placebo, p = 0.04). The risk of progression was still significantly reduced after adjustment for changes in systolic (p = 0.04) and diastolic (p = 0.04) blood pressure, but not after adjustment for changes in proteinuria.

    "109": "Using the established isovolumic perfused heart preparation under constant coronary flow, we found that an increment in left ventricular balloon volume generated an increase in systolic wall stress. The induction of left ventricular c-fos and c-myc mRNA (Northern blotting) was assessed in hearts subjected to increased systolic load without AT1 blockade (No AT1, n = 11) and with AT1 blockade (AT1, n = 11, losartan 40 mg.kg-1.d-1 x 5 days followed by 10(-5) mol/L infusion during perfusion). Flaccid hearts (no left ventricular balloon) served as controls (C, n = 9). The stimulation of new protein synthesis in response to increased systolic load was measured by incorporation of [3H]phenylalanine into cardiac proteins. Elevation of systolic load was associated with a twofold (P < .05) increase in c-fos and c-myc mRNA levels that was not blocked by losartan. The rate of [3H]phenylalanine incorporation into cardiac proteins was increased 2.7-fold (P < .01) in hearts subjected to increased systolic load compared with control hearts.

An early, low-dose ramipril (0.625 mg) arm was also evaluated. Clinical events did not differ. During the first 14 days, the risk of manifesting a systolic arterial pressure of < or = 90 mm Hg was increased in both ramipril groups. LVEF increased in all groups during this period, but the early, full-dose ramipril group had the greatest improvement in EF (increase: full, 4.9 +/- 10.0; low, 3.9 +/- 8.2%; delayed, 2.4 +/- 8.8%; P for trend < .05) and was the only group that did not demonstrate a significant increase in LV diastolic area.",

The use of low-dose regimen did not prevent hypotension and had only intermediate benefits on LV size and function. The more favorable effects on LV topography of the early use of full-dose ramipril support the results of the major clinical trials, which have demonstrated an early survival benefit of ACE inhibition.",

The latter have improved the chances of survival of patients with chronic cardiac insufficiency. The combination of hydralazine hydrochloride and isosorbide dinitrate also improves survival, but direct comparison of both regimens provided evidence for a less favourable effect than that of the ACE inhibitors. Inhibition of neuroendocrine activation has been demonstrated only for ACE inhibitors and cardiac glycosides. The use of beta blockers represents a new therapeutic strategy that over the long term improves cardiomyocyte function, cardiac output at rest, and physical performance. For this indication, however, beta blockers should be used with extreme caution and at very low initial doses. New approaches in the area of clinical research are, for example, calcium sensitizers, modulators of intracellular calcium and/or sodium homeostasis, imidazolin receptor antagonists with an action on the central nervous system and AT1 receptor antagonists.", 
    "115": "Previous studies have suggested that angiotensin II (Ang II) modulates cardiac contractility, rhythm, metabolism, and structure. However, it is unclear whether the cardiac effects are due to direct actions of Ang II on the myocardium or if they are due to secondary effects mediated through the hemodynamic actions of Ang II. In this study, we used the alpha-myosin heavy chain (alphaMHC) promoter to generate transgenic mice overexpressing angiotensin II type 1 (AT1a) receptor selectively in cardiac myocytes. The specificity of transgene expression in the transgenic offspring was confirmed by radioligand binding studies and reverse transcription-PCR. The offspring displayed massive atrial enlargement with myocyte hyperplasia at birth, developed significant bradycardia with heart block, and died within the first weeks after birth. Thus, direct activation of AT1 receptor signaling in cardiac myocytes in vivo is sufficient to induce cardiac myocyte growth and alter electrical conduction.",

This was associated with sensitivity levels of 0.65 and 0.68, respectively. The difference between the uptake of pentetic acid with and without captopril challenge in the 85 patients who were studied under both circumstances was no more accurate as a predictor of renal artery stenosis. In the 93 patients who were studied with mertiatide as well as with pentetic acid, both after captopril challenge, the diagnostic accuracy was no better with mertiatide than with pentetic acid; mertiatide failed to offer any advantage not only when the single-kidney fractional uptake was used as a criterion, but also with the use of other scintigraphic parameters (eg, time to peak, time to pyelum, overall shape of renographic curve, and kidney size).", 
    "120": "The diagnostic accuracy of renal scintigraphy has not been improved by the introduction of mertiatide or by the use of captopril. The usefulness of scintigraphy as a diagnostic test for the presence of renal artery stenosis remains questionable.

    "121": "Diabetic nephropathy is one of the major complications of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), with proteinuria being the main clinical manifestation of diabetic nephropathy. Most patients who develop overt proteinuria progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), usually within 5 to 7 years; ESRD necessitates dialysis or renal transplantation. Although a relationship between blood pressure reduction and delaying of ESRD has been assumed for a long time, only recently has a controlled randomised clinical trial shown that the treatment of diabetic nephropathy with an ACE inhibitor can significantly delay the loss of renal function and, therefore, ESRD. Consistent with the clinical trial on which this economic evaluation was based, the costs and consequences of 2 alternatives were considered: (i) patients subject to blood pressure control with only antihypertensive medication, but without an ACE inhibitor (placebo group) and (ii) patients given ACE inhibitor therapy (captopril group) with similar blood pressure control to the placebo group. This cost-effectiveness analysis was performed from the perspective of the Italian National Health Service [Servizio Sanitario Nazionale (SSN)]. Accordingly, only direct costs related to publicly funded healthcare services were included. The number of dialysis-years avoided (DYA) was the clinical end-point. A 10-year time horizon was considered for the economic evaluation. Captopril therapy was dominant, being at the same time more effective and less costly. The total cost for the captopril alternative during the 10-year period was 21,901,625 Italian lire (L; 1993 values) per patient, while total cost for the placebo alternative was L30,352,590 per patient. Compared with placebo, 20.01 DYA per 100 patients treated were estimated with captopril therapy during the trial period, equivalent to 2.4 months per patient. The robustness of this result was confirmed by sensitivity analysis: for both extremes, captopril remained dominant. This economic evaluation, requested by the Italian Ministry of Health, demonstrated savings in healthcare expenditure with the use of an ACE inhibitor in patients with proteinuria.", 
    "122": "Publication bias is an established notion in the clinical literature; essentially, large studies or positive results are more likely to find their way into the public domain than small studies or negative results. Meta-analysis presents a focus for the problems of publication bias, seeking to summarise the evidence in a particular therapeutic area by retrieving and analysing all available clinical studies. Economic analyses are also vulnerable to publication bias, and at 3 levels: first, in the health-outcomes data available for modelling (resulting from publication bias in the clinical literature); second, in the motivations for conducting an economic analysis; and third, in repeating the process of seeking publication.", 
    "123": "Renal failure is a common long-term complication of diabetes mellitus. Stages of diabetic nephropathy have been described that characterize its clinical course. Diabetic nephropathy develops secondary to long-standing hyperglycemia and hemodynamic changes that damage the glomerulus. Therapy that focuses on the control of glomerular pressures and systemic hypertension can slow the progression of proteinuria and deterioration of renal function. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and calcium channel blockers have been demonstrated to be effective in the management of diabetic nephropathy. A systematic approach to the patient with diabetes with annual screening for proteinuria will help identify those individuals early in the course of disease when proper therapy may be most helpful.",

    "126": "Only modified St. Thomas cardioplegia was used. CPL group: St. Thomas cardioplegia containing CPL 4.6 mumol/L was used and the same concentration of captopril in the circulatory blood was established before releasing the cross clamp. CPL + phenylephrine group: The concentration was the same as the CPL group, with an additional dose of phenylephrine (2 micrograms/kg) into the oxygenator and abdominal coarctation. The results revealed that the coronary blood flow and left ventricular contractility and relaxation indices of CPL group were significantly improved than those of the control group, and increasing the systemic and pulmonary vascular resistence had no effect on the cardiac function protected by captopril. It is suggested that captopril could ameliorate the recovery of myocardial performences by inhibitting myocardial and systemic renin-angiotensin system and scavenging free radicals.", 
    "127": "The changes in the expression of cardiac alpha- and beta-myosin heavy chain (MHC) gene of the left ventricle were investigated in two-kidney, one-clip (2K1C) renal hypertensive rats. The results were as follows: (1) When blood pressure was increased, the left ventricle became hypertrophic, alpha-MHC gene expression was reduced and beta-MHC gene expression was increased in 2K1C renal hypertensive rats. (2) When the animal was treated with captopril, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor 4 W after operation and then 8 W with removal of the ischemic kidney, the blood pressure was decreased with attendant regression of left ventricular hypertrophy, while the increase in beta-MHC mRNA level was attenuated and the inhibition of alpha-MHC mRNA level was reduced. The above results suggest that the rise in arteral pressure is an important factor in the left ventricular hypertrophy and the MHC gene switch. Renin angiotension system may be involved in the cardiac hypertrophic and MHC gene switch during the development and maintenance of 2K1C renal hypertension.", 
    "128": "When an approximately 30 centiMorgan (cM) region of chromosome 13 containing the renin gene from the Dahl salt-resistant rat (R) was introgressed into the Dahl salt-sensitive rat (S), the resulting congenic rat (designated S.R-Ren) had a systolic blood pressure on a 2% (w/w) salt diet that was 24 mmHg lower than that of its S counterpart. Due to the large size of the transferred segment (over 30 million bp), the question remained as to whether or not the renin gene was the cause of the blood-pressure difference between the strains. We evaluated the role of the renin-angiotensin system in S.R-Ren and S rats fed a 0.05% salt diet by examining differences between strains in (1) expression of renin in three tissue types, (2) the blood-pressure response to blockade of both angiotensin-converting enzyme and angiotensin II receptors, and (3) pressure natriuresis. No differences were found in renin levels in plasma, kidney or adrenal gland between strains. The blood-pressure responses to the angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor captopril and to the angiotensin II-receptor blocker saralasin in conscious S and S.R-Ren rats were similar. Furthermore, renal function, evaluated by a pressure-natriuresis index that took into account both the time and the arterial pressure needed to excrete an acute salt load, did not differ between strains. Our findings therefore fail to demonstrate a role for the renin gene in conferring lower blood pressure in the congenic rat and suggest that there is an unknown arterial-pressure-regulating locus in this 30 cM region of chromosome 13.", 
    "129": "The CASSIS study was a double-blind multicentric controlled Czech and Slovak study focused on treatment of chronic heart failure with the ACE inhibitor spirapril; it was conducted for 12 weeks. The present work analyzes the second year of the extended open part of the study when all patients (n = 168) were treated with 3 mg or 6 mg spirapril. A small proportion of the patients was treated with 12 mg spirapril. The objective of the study was to test the long-term effectiveness and tolerance of spirapril. The general mortality was analyzed throughout the whole two-year period. The results revealed an unchanging total mortality, analyzed after three-month intervals, during the whole two-year period. Also the functional improvement of the patients according to NYHA which occurred after the first three months of treatment was preserved during the second year. Spirapril proved to be a well tolerated ACE-inhibitor. The authors did not observe angioneurotic oedema in any of the patients. Hypotension and cough were recorded in 0.6% of the patients. The incidence of undesirable laboratory effects was also low and the majority was due to the basic disease. Creatinine did not rise significantly and a rise of urea was observed only in a small number of patients. Liver functions and haemogram did not change during treatment. The results of the second year of erxtension indicate that spirapril is a very effective and safe ACE-inhibitor which will extend in a significant way therapeutic means in patients with chronic heart failure.", 
    "130": "Spirapril, an ACE-inhibitor without the SH group was tested in a randomized double-blind multicentric study in patients with chronic symptomatic heart failure (NYHA II-IV). After a 1-4-week initial stage with placebo the patients were randomized into five groups: the first was given placebo, the second one spirapril 1.5 mg, the third one spirapril 3 mg, the fourth one spirapril 6 mg and the fifth one 5 and later 10 mg for a period of 12 weeks. The number of patients in different groups was in the following order: 48, 48, 53, 51 and 48. The condition for admission into the study was chronic heart failure not responding adequately to treatment with digoxin and diuretics, IHD or dilatation cardiomyopathy with the left ventricular ejection fraction (% tolerating a basic ergometric load for two minutes. The primary criterium was an increment during the period of the load, secondary criteria comprised objective and subjective cardiac symptoms, changes in the left ventricular ejection fraction, cardiothoracic index/heart size and quality of life. The load tolerance increased in all groups, however, no significant differences between groups were found. The authors also found regression of signs of pulmonary congestion during active spirapril treatment and diminution of the cardiac shadow. Moreover the authors proved a significant reduction of the mortality in the actively treated patients as compared with those receiving placebo, a lower frequency of hospital admissions and reduction of serious undesirable cardiovascular symptoms during active treatment. In patients with medium severe and severe cardiac failure with IHD, combination with short acting calcium channel blockers had an unfavourable effect on the load tolerance and clinical parameters. Sprirapril, combined with diuretics and digoxin is a suitable drug also in chronic cardiac failure. Questionable remains the importance of loading tests when verifying the effectiveness of ACE-inhibitors. Treatment with short-time acting calcium antagonists cannot be recommended in symptomatic chronic cardiac failure.",

    "143": "The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of age and an increased intake of dietary sodium on the cardiovascular and renal effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, ramipril. Male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) aged 10 and 60 weeks received either control or a high level of sodium (0.3% vs. 2.6% Na) and ramipril (2 mg/kg/day) mixed in the chow for 6 weeks. Blood pressure was measured weekly by tail-cuff method. Arterial functions were determined by measuring vascular contractile and relaxation responses of mesenteric arterial rings in vitro at the end of the study. An age-related increase in systolic blood pressure, left ventricular (LVH) and renal hypertrophy (RH) as well as proteinuria were found in SHR. The vascular relaxation to nitroprusside was impaired in aged SHR. The high sodium intake accelerated the development of hypertension only in young SHR but increased LVH and RH in both age groups. Ramipril effectively lowered blood pressure in both age groups, but decreased the LVH significantly only in young rats. Ramipril markedly improved the vascular relaxation to acetylcholine and nitroprusside only in young rats. The vascular contractile responses to noradrenaline and potassium chloride were not affected by age, sodium intake or ramipril treatment. The high sodium intake markedly attenuated the cardiovascular effects of ramipril. The high-sodium diet enhanced the urinary excretion of cyclic GMP in both age groups, while it increased urinary excretion of protein in young SHR only. In conclusion, the cardiovascular effects of ramipril were impaired with advanced age even in the presence of a control intake of sodium. A high sodium intake attenuated or even abolished the cardiovascular effects of ramipril in both young and aged SHR.",

    "146": "ACE-inhibitors antagonize both angiotensin production and bradykinin breakdown, resulting in enhancement of vasodilating prostaglandin release. This provides an explanation for the experimental observation that cycloxygenase blockers (such as aspirin or indomethacin) may counteract the antihypertensive efficacy of the ACE-inhibitors; it may be also possible that hypertensive patients taking aspirin as an antiplatelet agent may fail to benefit from ACE-inhibition. This study was aimed at: evaluating the magnitude and incidence of the inhibitory phenomenon; defining the minimal aspirin dosage that produces an antagonistic effect, as well as the possible reasons for a different individual susceptibility. We have studied untreated patients with mild (10 cases, Group 1), moderate (16 cases, Group 2) or severe (26 cases, Group 3) hypertension. The ACE-inhibitor enalapril was used at doses of 10 mg bid (groups 1 and 2) or 20 mg bid (Group 3). Active drug treatment periods had a 5-day duration. A daily dose of aspirin of 100 mg had no effect on the antihypertensive efficacy of enalapril. On the contrary, when a dose of 300 mg was used, 60, 57 and 50% of patients in Group 1, 2 and 3, respectively, showed a > 20% restraint of the mean arterial pressure fall with enalapril (20% was the lower arbitrary limit for defining antagonism). Inhibition was independent of the sequence of drug administration. In these patients counteraction averaged 60, 70 and 90%, respectively. In them, and not in the remaining patients in each group, aspirin substantially attenuated the renin rise elicited by ACE-inhibition. These data suggest that: a dosage of 100 mg aspirin is devoid of any inhibitory effect; more that 50% of ACE inhibited patients are, at least in the short term, susceptible to the action of 300 mg aspirin, regardless of the severity of hypertension; counteraction is seemingly mediated through a prostaglandin inhibition and depends on the individual predominance of prostaglandin activation (also as a renin secretory stimulus) or angiotensin inhibition by the ACE-inhibitor.",

Of 7451 such admissions, 348 (4.7%) were diagnosed as having acute heart failure: 265 Caucasian (76.1%), 27 black/Afro Caribbean (7.7%), 56 Indo-Asian (16.1%). Complete clinical data were available from 260 patients. The main presenting symptom was dyspnoea in 233 patients (89.6%) and chest pain in 60 patients (23.1%); 139 patients (53.5%) had a history of ischaemic heart disease, 87 (33.5%) hypertension and 49 (18.8%) had diabetes; 103 patients (39.6%) had a previous history of heart failure; 75 patients (28.8%) were in atrial fibrillation. An echocardiogram was performed in 89 patients (34.2%). On admission, ACE inhibition was prescribed to only 78 patients (30.0). The diagnosis of heart failure was stated on the hospital inpatient data sheet (KMR-1) in only 170 patients (65.4%). Following admission, 50 patients (19.2%) died while in the wards. Heart failure is a common problem among acute medical admissions and has a poor prognosis. The KMR-1 diagnosis may underestimate the prevalence of heart failure.",

The cartilage-bone marrow extract and the glycosaminoglycan-peptide complex (DAK-16) dose-dependently inhibited MMP proteoglycanases in vitro when tested at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 55 mg/mL, displaying an IC50 value of 31.78 mg/mL and 10.64 mg/mL (1.9 x 10[-4] M) respectively. (R,S)-N-[2-[2-(hydroxyamino)-2-oxoethyl]-4-methyl-1-oxopentyl++ +]-L-leucyl-L-phenylalaninamide (U-24522) proved to be a potent inhibitor of MMP proteoglycanases (IC50 value 1.8 x 10[-9] M). None of the other tested drugs, such as possible chondroprotective drugs, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), glucocorticoids and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors tested at a concentration of 10(-4) M displayed any significant inhibition. Only U-24522, tested at a concentration ranging from 10(-4) to 10(-6) M, significantly inhibited the IL-1-induced augmentation of PG loss from cartilage explants into the nutrient media, whereas DAK-16 and the cartilage-bone marrow extract were ineffective. DAK-16 and the cartilage-bone marrow extract did not modulate the IL-1-mediated reduced biosynthesis and aggregability of PGs by the cartilage explants. The addition of 10(-5) M U-24522, however, partially maintained the aggregability of PGs ex vivo.

To investigate the mechanism of this decrease, we studied the regulation of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), tissue type plasminogen activator (TPA), tissue factor (TF), and tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) by angiotensin II (Ang II) in cultured rat aortic endothelial cells. Ang II increased PAI-1 and TF mRNA expression without affecting that of TPA or TFPI. These inductions were accompanied by increases in PAI-1 and TF activities and were inhibited by a type I Ang II receptor antagonist. The results suggest that Ang II decreases the antithrombotic properties of endothelial cells which increases the chance of thrombosis. Thus, inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system may be beneficial to prevent thrombus formation in treatment of ischemic heart disease.",

The antihypertensive effects of DU-1777 at 10 mg/kg p.o. and cromakalim at 0.3 mg/kg p.o. were partially (about 60%) or fully antagonized by glibenclamide at 10 mg/kg i.v. in 2-kidney, 1-clip renal hypertensive rats (2K-1C RHR). The antihypertensive effects of a Ca blocker (nifedipine) and other ACE inhibitors (captopril, alacepril, enalapril, lisinopril, imidapril and quanapril) were not antagonized by glibenclamide. In deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt hypertensive rats (DOCA-HR), the antihypertensive effects of DU-1777 at 3-30 mg/kg p.o. were fully antagonized by glibenclamide. However, in vitro, DU-1777 (10(-6)-10(-3) mol/l) did not affect aortic ring contractions induced by high K (30 mmol/l). In guinea pig, citric acid induced cough was increased by ACE inhibitors, captopril, alacepril, enalapril and lisinopril (10 and 30 mg/kg p.o.). DU-1777 had a tendency to decrease citric acid induced cough and the effect was antagonized by glibenclamide. These results suggest that while DU-1777 itself does not open ATP-dependent K channel, it indirectly produces these effects through unknown mechanisms in vivo. Moreover, these effects contributed to the antihypertensive effect in DOCA-HR and cough suppressant effect in guinea pigs.",

Examples are the amyloid precursor protein, membrane-bound growth factors and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). The identities and characteristics of the responsible proteases remain elusive. We have studied this process in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably expressing wild-type ACE (WT-ACE) or juxtamembrane (stalk) deletion or chimaera mutants. Determination of the C termini (i.e. the cleavage sites) of released, soluble wild-type and mutant ACE by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry indicated that the membrane-protein-solubilizing protease (MPSP) in CHO cells is not constrained by a particular cleavage site motif or by a specific distance from the membrane, but instead may position itself with respect to the putative proximal, folded extracellular domain adjacent to the stalk. Nevertheless, kinetic analyses of release rates indicated that a minimum distance from the membrane must be preserved. Interestingly, soluble full-length (anchor-plus) WT-ACE incubated with fractions of, or intact, CHO cells was not cleaved. In all cases, release was stimulated by a media change or by the addition of phorbol ester, with rate enhancements of 5- and 50-fold, respectively, for WT-ACE. The phorbol ester effect was abolished by staurosporine, a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor. We propose that the CHO cell MPSP that solubilizes ACE: (1) only cleaves proteins embedded in a membrane; (2) requires an accessible stalk and cleaves at a minimum distance from both the membrane and proximal extracellular domain; (3) positions itself primarily with respect to the proximal extracellular domain and (4) is regulated in part by a PKC-dependent mechanism.", 
    "164": "The main objective of this study was to determine if the components of the kallikrein-kinin system are released into the venous effluent from isolated perfused rat hearts. To assess the contribution of kinins and the vascular and cardioprotective effects of the ACE inhibitor ramipril, we determined the status of cardiac kallikrein (CKK), potent kinin-generating enzyme, in rats with right ventricular hypertrophy induced by chronic volume overload and left ventricular hypertrophy by aortic banding. CKK was measured as previously described (Nolly, H.L., Carbini, L., Carretero, O.A., Scicli, A.G., 1994). Kininogen by a modification of the technique of Dinitz and Carvalho (1963) and kinins were extracted with a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge and measured by RIA. CKK (169 +/- 9 pg Bk/30 min), kininogen (670 +/- 45 pg Bk/30 min) and immunoreactive kinins (62 +/- 10 pg Bk/30 min) were released into the perfusate. The release was almost constant over a 120 min period. Pretreatment with the protein synthesis inhibitor puromycin (10 mg i.p.) lowered the release of kallikrein (42 +/- 12 pg Bk/30 min, p < 0.001) and kininogen (128 +/- 56 pg Bk/30 min, p < 0.001). Addition of ramiprilat (10 micrograms/ml) increased kinin release from 54 +/- 18 to 204 +/- 76 pg Bk/30 min (p < 0.001). Aortic banding of rats increased their blood pressure (BP) (p < 0.001), relative heart weight (RHW) (p < 0.001) and CKK (p < 0.001). Ramipril treatment induced a reduction in BP (p < 0.05) and RHW (p < 0.005) while CKK remained elevated. Aortocaval shunts increased their ANF plasma levels (p < 0.05), RHW (p < 0.001) and CKK (p < 0.01). Ramipril treatment induced a reduction in RHW (p < 0.05), while CKK and ANF increased significantly (p < 0.05). The present data show that the components of the kallikrein-kinin system are continuously formed in the isolated rat heart and that ramipril reduces bradykinin breakdown with subsequent increase in bradykinin outflow. The experiments with aorta caval shunt and aortic banding show that cardiac tissues increase their kinin-generating activity and this was even higher in ramipril-treated animals. This may suggest that the actual level of kinins is finely tuned to the local metabolic demands. In this experimental model of cardiac hypertrophy. ACE inhibitors potentiate the actions of kinins and probably try to normalise endothelial cell function.", 
    "165": "The effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril on thirteen endocrinological tests were evaluated. These tests comprised serum follitropin, lutropin, prolactin, thyrotropin, free thyroxine, total thyroxine, free triiodothyronine, parathyrin, cortisol, testosterone, sex hormone binding globulin, androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate. Eleven hypertensive outpatients, 9 men and 2 women, treated at the department of internal medicine in Turku University Central Hospital, received 5 mg of ramipril once a day for the study period of four weeks. The above mentioned endocrinological tests were performed before and at the end of the ramipril treatment. Ramipril decreased the value of free thyroxine statistically significantly, p = 0.011, from the mean value of 17.1 pmol/l to the mean value of 16.0 pmol/l when measured with Amerlex-MAB* free thyroxine kit. The mean within-subject difference was -1.10 pmol/l with a 95% confidence interval of -1.87 - -0.33 pmol/l. With the AutoDELFIA free thyroxine kit and with the reference method dialysis+RIA no effect was detected. Other endocrinological tests examined were not affected by ramipril. Since the decreasing effect of ramipril on free thyroxine was detected only with Amerlex-MAB* but neither with AutoDELFIA nor with dialysis+RIA, the effect was concluded to be analytical. The underlying mechanism and the component ultimately interfering with the analysis is unknown.",

    "170": "The objective of this study was to determine the effect of angiotensin I (Ang I) treatment in vivo on two major Ca-transport systems-the L-type voltage dependent calcium channel (L-VDCC) and the Na/Ca exchanger in rat heart. For our experiments we used four groups of rats, treated differently with saline, Ang I, the ACE inhibitor enalapril and/or combination of both for 6 days, every 24 h. We observed an increase in the activity, and also in mRNA expression of the Na/Ca exchanger, after repeated administration of Ang I in vivo. The maximal binding capacity of Ca-antagonist PN 200-110, which binds to the alpha 1 subunit of the L-VDCC was elevated from 0.8-1.85 pg/mg protein. mRNA expression of the voltage-dependent calcium channels of L-type system was also upregulated by Ang I administration, but not when enalapril was applied simultaneously with Ang I. These results demonstrate that in vivo application of the Ang I significantly modulates not only the activity, but also expression of the Na/Ca exchanger and the L-VDCC in rat hearts through angiotensin II (Ang II). Since in the in vitro experiments on the isolated cardiomyocytes, Ang II (100 nM) increased the calcium uptake after depolarization, and the AT1 receptor agonist losartan prevented this increase, we assume that this regulation might involve the AT1 receptors.", 
    "171": "Kinins are potent bioactive peptides formed by the enzymatic action of kallikrein on kininogens. The discovery that angiotensin-converting enzyme, which generates angiotensin II, is also a major degrading enzyme of kinins, gave rise to the hypothesis that kinin potentiation, in addition to angiotensin II reduction, may be involved in the therapeutic actions of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have become important drugs in the treatment of hypertension, congestive heart failure, postmyocardial infarction, and diabetic nephropathy. Although angiotensin II reduction appears to be the predominant mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of chronic angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor treatment, the role of kinins in the antihypertensive effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors seems to be renin dependent and cannot be generalized for all models of hypertension. On the other hand, at least under experimental conditions, various cardioprotective effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors appear to be due to the potentiation of endogenous kinins, including improved cardiac function, structural changes following myocardial ischemia, and induction of capillary growth in hypertension-induced left ventricular hypertrophy.",

Treatment was started following MI and lasted 8 weeks, after which rats were sacrificed for in vitro studies. Left ventricular end-systolic pressure was higher in rats treated with captopril (83 +/- 6 mmHg) and ibopamine (80 +/- 3 mmHg), as compared with untreated MI rats (48 +/- 6 mmHg, P < .01 for both). Increased plasma norepinephrine levels in MI rats were reduced by captopril and ibopamine (both P < .05). Infarct size was smaller in rats treated with captopril (26.7 +/- 3.6%, P < .05) and ibopamine (31.4 +/- 4.3%, P = NS), as compared with untreated rats (41.7 +/- 2.4%). Maximal endothelium-dependent relaxation (Emax; % precontraction) and the concentration of methacholine causing 50% Emax, expressed as negative log(pIC50) were significantly reduced in aortic rings from MI control subjects (pIC50 = 6.15 +/- 0.06 mol/L, Emax = 32.0 +/- 4.2%), as compared with normal control subjects (pIC50 = 6.57 +/- 0.07 mol/L, P < .001; Emax = 50.0 +/- 4.9%, P = .022).

After enrollment of 36 patients, the study was terminated early because no beneficial effects on exercise tolerance and hemodynamic parameters could be shown for the urapidil treatment, and a trend toward increased mortality of the urapidil group was observed (odds ratio, 4.92 [0.49-49.6]; P = .167).",

    "178": "The present study was undertaken to examine the effects of volume overload on cardiac gene expression and the possible role of angiotensin AT1 receptor in such expression. Cardiac volume overload was prepared by abdominal aortocaval shunt in rats. Rats with aortocaval shunt were treated with 1) vehicle, 2) an angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonist, CS-866 (10 mg/kg/d), or 3) an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, temocapril (10 mg/kg/d), for 7 days. Cardiac tissue mRNA was measured by Northern blot analysis with specific probes. Aortocaval shunt not only caused cardiac hypertrophy but also upregulated the gene expression of atrial natriuretic polypeptide, collagen III, and downregulated Ca(2+)-ATPase expression in the left ventricle. These changes were prevented by treatment with CS-866, while temocapril failed to normalize left ventricular Ca(2+)-ATPase expression. Unlike the left ventricle, the significant downregulation of alpha-myosin heavy chain and transforming growth factor-beta 3 by aortocaval shunt was observed in the right ventricle, and CS-866 normalized this decreased expression of transforming growth factor-beta 3. The left and right atria showed increased expression of collagen type I as well as of collagen type III and atrial natriuretic polypeptide, and these increases were more effectively prevented by CS-866 than by temocapril. Thus, the effects of cardiac volume overload on cardiac performance-related gene expression differ between the ventricles and atria. Our results suggest that AT1 receptor partially contributed to volume overload-induced changes in cardiac gene expression and that AT1 receptor antagonists and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have different effects in this model of cardiac hypertrophy.",

Fourteen days after injury of the aorta the hypertensive rats had significantly higher neointima: media ratios than did the normotensive rats (0.83 +/- 0.09 versus 068 +/- 0.01, P < 0.01). This was associated with a significant increase in vascular media and neointima ACE concentrations in SHR (media 965 +/- 25 dpm/mm2, neointima 614 +/- 48 dpm/mm2) compared with those in normotensive SD rats after balloon angioplasty (media 669 +/- 23 dpm/mm2, neointima 287 +/- 33 dpm/mm2, P < 0.01). ACE inhibitor treatment with 10 mg/kg body weight lisinopril daily for 14 days by gavage reduced neointima proliferation in hypertensive and normotensive rats (neointima: media ratio: 0.35 +/- 0.02 for SHR, P < 0.01, versus untreated SHR with balloon injury; 0.28 +/- 0.01 for SD, P < 0.01, versus untreated SD rats with balloon injury). This was associated with significant vascular media ACE inhibition (SHR 149 +/- 9 dpm/mm2; SD rats 118 +/- 7 dpm/mm2; P < 0.01 versus untreated controls with balloon injury) and neointima ACE inhibition (SHR 73 +/- 4 dpm/mm2, SD rats 63 +/- 7 dpm/mm2, P < 0.01, versus untreated controls with balloon injury), but also lowered the blood pressure in SHR significantly (to 148 +/- 5 mmHg, P < 0.01, versus untreated SHR with balloon injury). When this drop in blood pressure was prevented by feeding the rats a high-salt diet (SHR with ACE inhibitor plus high salt-diet group blood pressure 193 +/- 3 mmHg, P = 0.57, versus untreated SHR) hypertension per se without the local ACE increase (ACE concentration in SHR with ACE inhibitor high-salt diet rats' media 167 +/- 10 dpm/mm2 and neointima 81 +/- 9 dpm/mm2) had only a mild effect on neointima formation after balloon angioplasty (neointima: media ratio 0.4 +/- 0.01 for SHR with ACE inhibitor plus high-salt diet versus 0.35 +/- 0.02 for SHR with ACE inhibitor plus normal-salt diet P < 0.05). Treatment with 10 mg/kg body weight angiotensin II subtype 1 receptor antagonist losartan potassium daily for 14 days by gavage was associated with a reduction in neointima formation similar to that observed with the ACE inhibitor both for SHR and for SD rats (neointima: media ratio 0.32 +/- 0.04 for SHR with losartan, 0.27 +/- 0.03 for SD rats with losartan; P < 0.01, versus untreated controls with balloon injury) suggesting that ACE inhibitor prevented neointima formation, at least in part by, reducing the local production of angiotensin II.",

This is due mainly to there being a higher degree of activation of the renin-angiotensin system in the aorta of the SHR before and after balloon injury compared with that in normotensive SD rats measured in terms of the increased vascular ACE concentrations.

The most pronounced vasodilatation was observed in interlobular arteries (19 +/- 2%) and in cortical afferent arterioles (16 +/- 3%). Pretreatment of the hydronephrotic kidney by local application of 40 nmol/l Hoe140, a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist, or 3 mumol/l valsartan, an ANGII type 1 receptor antagonist, attenuated the vasodilatation in response to quinapril. ANGII receptor blockade affected only weakly, whereas bradykinin receptor blockade blunted markedly, the quinapril-induced vasodilatation, suggesting that kinins play an important role in our experimental model. Administration of valsartan, which abrogated the renal vasoconstriction induced by 10 nmol/l ANGII completely, caused vasodilation of magnitude similar to that caused by administration of quinapril. Yet, the vasodilatation induced by the combination of valsartan and quinapril was significantly larger than that induced by administration of quinapril alone in interlobular arteries, afferent arterioles, and cortical efferent arterioles.",

Sporadic cases of angioedema secondary to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) have been reported in the literature. The overall incidence is around 0.1% to 0.2%, and the time of onset is usually during the first week of ACEI therapy. Late-onset angioedema secondary to treatment with ACEIs is much more frequent than appreciated, and is largely unrecognized because of the absence of temporal correlation between ACEI therapy and the development of angioedema. Since angioedema may progress to upper airway obstruction, otolaryngologists must be aware of this association. Most importantly, late-onset angioedema should alert the clinician to discontinue the ACEI immediately to prevent further morbidity. This report presents an example of late-onset angioedema which was precipitated by taking a double dose of captopril incidentally. The case is discussed, and the literature, pathophysiology and treatment of angioedema are reviewed.",

The end points were 24-hour, daytime, and nighttime mean blood pressure values and the percentage of elevated systolic and diastolic measurements, reflecting the \"hypertensive load.\" Enalapril reduced mean 24-hour systolic blood pressure by 18 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure by 11 mmHg. The comparative values for captopril were 9 mmHg and 2 mmHg, respectively. The mean daytime systolic blood pressure was reduced by 20 mmHg with enalapril versus 7 mmHg with captopril; the diastolic values were lowered by 11 mmHg with enalapril versus 4 mmHg with captopril. The mean nighttime systolic blood pressure was lowered by 16 mmHg with enalapril versus 12 mmHg with captopril; the diastolic values were reduced by 10 mmHg with enalapril and 5 mmHg with captopril.

Significant blood pressure reductions (p < 0.001) were achieved in both treatment groups: from 160/105 to 128/88 mmHg in group A (mean doses: hydrochlorothiazide 33 and sotalol 197 mg) and from 162/106 to 135/89 mmHg in group B (hydrochlorothiazide 33 and captopril 64 mg) after 12 months, respectively.

No significant changes were observed in total cholesterol nor in lipoprotein(a) concentrations in either treatment group. Fasting plasma glucose and hemoglobin A1 increased significantly (p < 0.05) only in group A after 1 year of treatment (from 91.6 to 98.0 mg/dl, and from 6.3 to 6.9%, respectively). Serum levels of creatinine and potassium decreased, and uric acid increased significantly under either combination. Our data show that the diuretic/beta-blocker combination has adverse effects on lipid and glucose metabolism after long-term therapy. The effects of the diuretic/ACE inhibitor combination on lipid metabolism are less pronounced and there are no adverse effects on glucose metabolism. However, the ACE inhibitor component could not completely counteract the metabolic effects of the diuretic. Both combinations have no effects on Lp(a). We conclude that the combination of hydrochlorothiazide with an ACE inhibitor has a better metabolic profile for the treatment of essential hypertension than the combination with a beta-blocker.",

There were no changes in the lipid levels in the spirapril treatment group whereas the concentration of apoprotein A1 decreased significantly (p < 0.05) in the group treated with atenolol when compared with baseline. There was a tendency in the levels of serum cholesterol and triglycerides to increase and in the level of HDL cholesterol to decrease in the atenolol treatment group compared with baseline. Fasting blood glucose levels did not change significantly in the treatment group when compared with baseline. The 2-hour blood glucose level in the glucose tolerance test increased significantly after the 12-month therapy with both spirapril (p < 0.05) and atenolol (p < 0.05) when compared with baseline levels. There was also a tendency in the 2-hour insulin levels to increase in both the spirapril and the atenolol treatment group after the 12-month treatment period. In conclusion, spirapril had no effect on lipid metabolism whereas atenolol had some untoward effects.

The most selective inhibitor, Pro-Phe-psi(PO2CH2)-Leu-Pro-NH2 displayed a Ki value of 12 nM towards endopeptidase 3.4.24.16 and was 5540 fold less potent on its related peptidase endopeptidase 3.4.24.15. Furthermore, this inhibitor was 12.5 less potent on angiotensin-converting enzyme and was unable to block endopeptidase 3.4.24.11, aminopeptidases B and M, dipeptidylaminopeptidase IV and proline endopeptidase. 3. The effect of Pro-Phe-psi(PO2CH2)-Leu-Pro-NH2, in vitro and in vivo, on neurotensin metabolism in the central nervous system was examined. 4. Pro-Phe-psi(PO2CHH2)-Leu-Pro-NH2 dose-dependently inhibited the formation of neurotensin 1-10 and concomittantly protected neurotensin from degradation by primary cultured neurones from mouse embryos. 5. Intracerebroventricular administration of Pro-Phe-psi(PO2CH2)-Leu-Pro-NH2 significantly potentiated the neurotensin-induced antinociception of mice in the hot plate test. 6. Altogether, our study has established Pro-Phe-psi(PO2CH2)-Leu-Pro-NH2 as a fully selective and highly potent inhibitor of endopeptidase 3.4.24.16 and demonstrates, for the first time, the contribution of this enzyme in the central metabolism of neurotensin.", 
    "204": "Previous studies have shown that an oral sodium load during sodium deprivation is excreted faster than an intravenous load. We wanted to study whether the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system might be associated with this phenomenon and therefore the influence of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril was investigated. The experiments were performed on four strains of rat: spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats, inbred hypertension-prone (SS/Jr) and hypertension-resistant (SR/Jr) Dahl rats. In SHR and WKY rats pretreated with enalapril it was observed that an intravenous sodium load induced a renal sodium excretion which was between two and five times larger than that seen after an oral load. In SR/Jr and SS/Jr rats the sodium excretion was the same regardless of the route of administration. In SS/Jr rats sodium excretion increased three- to fourfold upon sodium repletion, whereas no significant increase was observed in SR/Jr rats. Thus, the present results indicate that an intact renin-angiotensin system is necessary for the interplay between the gastrointestinal tract and kidney.", 
    "205": "The basic mechanisms that cause aging are still poorly understood. Longitudinal prospective population studies using noninvasive examination techniques have improved our ability to differentiate between aging and disease. This review describes some general morphological and functional aging-related changes of the heart that have clinical relevance, and considers the possibility of drug treatment for the manifestations of aging per se. Digitalis has not been shown to improve the aging-related decline in myocardial strength and contractility. During aging, heart tissue stiffens and the speed and extent of diastolic filling decline. The latter is a limiting functional factor, particularly during increases in heart rate. Lowering peripheral vascular resistance, which is often increased in older people, might indirectly improve heart function. However, no drug has been shown to improve myocardial strength or lower tissue stiffness via a direct effect on the heart. It has been claimed, however, that calcium antagonists might improve diastolic filling. Morphological changes during aging are dominated by some left ventricular wall and septal hypertrophy, and left atrial and ventricular widening. Recent findings have suggested that angiotensin II might act as a growth stimulating factor, promoting cardiac hypertrophy. This has led to speculation that ACE inhibitors might contribute to the restructuring of the heart, not only in hypertension but also in patients with the common combination of slightly elevated blood pressure and aging-related myocardial hypertrophy. At present, it appears that improving exogenous factors (e.g. lifestyle, living circumstances and access to adequate medical care) offers greater opportunities for postponing cardiac aging than drugs that directly interfere with the physiological aging of the heart.", 
    "206": "Raised blood pressure in the elderly is not a normal consequences of aging, but is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Cardiac and cerebrovascular disease account for > 50% of deaths among people aged > 65 years. Because the percentage of elderly people in most populations is rising, blood pressure control in this group is becoming increasingly important. Several large intervention studies in the elderly have demonstrated that antihypertensive medication reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In addition, the absolute benefits of blood pressure reduction are higher in elderly compared with younger patients. ACE inhibitors are effective and well tolerated in the treatment of hypertension in the elderly. Their success led to interest in alternative ways of blocking the renin angiotensin system, and the subsequent development of angiotensin II (AII) receptor antagonists. Losartan was the first drug in this class to become commercially available. Since then, valsartan has been launched in some markets and others are likely to be launched in the near future. Losartan is effective in the treatment of essential hypertension and has a low incidence of adverse effects. First-dose hypotension is very uncommon and, at the present time, cough does not appear to be an adverse effect of these drugs, although long term tolerability studies are needed to confirm this. Angioedema, a rare but life-threatening adverse effect of ACE inhibitors, has also been associated with losartan. Current data suggest that All receptor antagonists are effective in elderly hypertensive patients, although further data are needed to confirm these findings. At present, All receptor antagonists are likely to be used in hypertensive patients who are intolerant of ACE inhibitors, although this may change with the availability of long term tolerability and clinical outcomes data.", 
    "207": "Digitalis has been widely used in the treatment of cardiac disease for more than 200 years. The present article reviews the current role of digitalis in the management of heart failure and atrial fibrillation (AF) in light of recent study findings. Generally, first-line therapy for the management of heart failure due to systolic dysfunction should include an ACE inhibitor and a diuretic. In patients who remain symptomatic despite the use of these drugs, the addition of digoxin should be considered. Because digoxin has been shown to reduce the number of hospital admissions attributable to worsening heart failure, more liberal use of digoxin in the management of heart failure may be justified. Digoxin may be adequate as monotherapy for ventricular rate control in patients with chronic AF, particularly in sedentary and elderly patients. A beta-blocker or calcium antagonist (either alone or in combination with digoxin) is indicated when digoxin is ineffective for ventricular rate control. Digoxin is ineffective in restoring sinus rhythm, preventing paroxysms or controlling rate in paroxysmal AF. The elderly are at an increased risk of digoxin toxicity. Low dosages of digoxin appear to be effective in the treatment of heart failure due to systolic dysfunction and may reduce the incidence of digitalis toxicity in these patients. In elderly patients with AF and inadequate rate control who are receiving digitalis monotherapy, adding another atrioventricular nodal blocking drug may be more appropriate than increasing the digoxin dose, in order to avoid toxic digoxin levels.",

Specific diagnostic procedures currently available to investigate affected children include Doppler and computed duplex sonography, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor sensitisation of radionuclide imaging, captopril-stimulated plasma renin activity, hypotensive responses to ACE inhibitor, renal vein renin measurements, renal angiography and magnetic resonance angiography. Carbon dioxide digital subtraction angiography and computerised tomographic and spiral angiography are also available and may play an important future role in such evaluations. Utilising this array of procedures it is usually possible to define the anatomical and functional status of the renal vasculature and be guided towards the most appropriate therapeutic manoeuvres.",

A total of 266 survivors following MI were identified from the discharge data of 13 hospitals in Southern England and registered with 71 GPs belonging to the Wessex Research Network. Median time since hospital discharge was 2.1 years. The main outcome measures were the provision of appropriate preventive care, including cardiac rehabilitation, drug therapy, and lifestyle advice for modifiable risk factors.", 
    "211": "Basic care was provided to nearly all patients; 253 (95.1%, 95% Cl 91.8-97.4) had blood pressure documented after their MI, 216 of 234 patients eligible for aspirin (92.3%; 88.1-95.4) had been recommended treatment, and the provision of advice on smoking cessation was documented for 27 of 33 continuing smokers (81.8%; 64.5-93.0). However, only 73 of 236 patients eligible to attend a structured rehabilitation programme (30.9%; 25.0-36.8) were documented as having received rehabilitation. Of 89 patients with heart failure following MI, 33 (37.1%; 27.1-48.0) had no record of having been offered treatment with an ACE inhibitor. Total cholesterol measurement was documented for only 144 patients (54.1%; 48.1-60.1). We estimate that there is still the potential to prevent between 4 and 9 deaths in this group of 266 surviving patients in the next 2 years by further improving the quality of follow-up care.",

    "213": "The aim of this study was to examine the effects of the water soluble component of cigarette smoke extract (CSE) on endothelium-dependent relaxation (EDR) of isolated rabbit aortas. The incubation with CSE was found to inhibit EDR in a dose-dependent manner. Co-incubation of the aortic strips with superoxide dismutase (SOD), N-acetylcysteine, glutathione or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), free radical scavengers, attenuated the CSE-induced inhibition of the arterial relaxation. Co-incubation of the strips with captopril (3 mM), an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, also attenuated CSE-induced impairment of vasorelaxation. In parallel experiments using cultured human endothelial cells, CSE suppressed endothelial release of NOx, stable metabolites of nitric oxide (NO). SOD, DMSO and captopril attenuated the suppression of NO production by CSE in association with reduction of free radicals, superoxide anions and hydroxyl radicals, in CSE solution. Neither lactate dehydrogenase release from the cultured endothelial cells nor cell death estimated by trypan blue exclusion test was found after the incubation of the cultured endothelial cells with CSE. The results indicate that free radicals in CSE induce the impairment of EDR, which may be partly due to suppression of NO production and is not due to non-specific cytotoxicity by CSE. Captopril attenuates CSE-induced endothelial dysfunction partly through scavenging free radicals.", 
    "214": "Two cases of \"scalded mouth syndrome\" are presented and discussed. This condition is a rare side effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are known to cause several other oral and extra-oral side effects.

    "215": "Fosinopril is a phosphorus-containing ester prodrug of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. It is hydrolysed mainly in the gastrointestinal mucosa and liver to the active diacid, fosinoprilat, which has unique pharmacological properties. The majority of the active moieties of other ACE inhibitors are excreted in the urine. This means that an adjustment in either the dosage and/or the administration interval is needed in patients with moderate to severe renal dysfunction, in order to reduce drug accumulation and the possibility of an excessive decrease in blood pressure or other adverse effects. On the other hand, fosinoprilat is excreted both in urine and bile (as with temocaprilat, zofenoprilat and spiraprilat), and thus an adjustment of dosage and/or administration interval may be unnecessary in patients with moderate to severe renal dysfunction, as impaired renal function influences little of the pharmacokinetics of fosinoprilat. Furthermore, the available evidence suggests that the pharmacokinetic variables of fosinoprilat in patients receiving haemodialysis were similar to those in patients with moderate to severe renal dysfunction. Dosage modifications or supplemental dose administration following dialysis may be unnecessary. The hypotensive effect of the combination of fosinopril and a diuretic is synergistic. Pharmacokinetic interactions with fosinopril are unlikely in patients receiving thiazide or loop diuretics. Fosinopril has beneficial effects for patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy because it produces an adequate reduction in blood pressure and reversal of left ventricular hypertrophy. There are a large number of studies of the pharmacokinetics of fosinopril. However studies of its pharmacokinetic drug interactions with other drugs are far fewer. Further investigations are needed in several clinical settings.", 
    "216": "We have previously shown that long-term angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition prevents the increase in aortic collagen in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), independent of blood pressure reduction. More recently, we reported that the effects of ACE inhibition in the prevention of aortic collagen accumulation were related to the inhibition of angiotensin II actions on angiotensin II type 1 receptors. Aldosterone, the synthesis of which is mainly modulated by angiotensin II through type 1 receptor stimulation, is known to promote cardiac fibrosis in different experimental models. The aim of the present study was to determine whether inhibition of aldosterone formation was able to prevent aortic fibrosis in SHRs. For this purpose, we compared the effects of a 4-month treatment with the aldosterone antagonist spironolactone with the ACE inhibitor quinapril in 4-week-old SHRs. Control SHRs and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats received placebo for the same period of time. At the end of treatment, in conscious SHRs vs WKY controls, quinapril completely prevented the development of hypertension, whereas spironolactone produced only a slight but significant reduction in blood pressure. Aortic hypertrophy was significantly prevented by ACE inhibition but not by spironolactone. On the contrary, aortic collagen accumulation was completely prevented by both quinapril and spironolactone. In the latter case, collagen density was significantly below that of WKY controls. These results show that in SHRs, spironolactone can markedly prevent aortic fibrosis in the presence of a very slight antihypertensive effect. It is suggested that ACE inhibition or type 1 receptor antagonist-induced prevention of aortic collagen accumulation is at least partially related to aldosterone inhibition.", 
    "217": "The objective of this study was to clarify potential differences in the metabolism of glucose and lipids in a long-term treatment (for 5 years) for hypertension among nifedipine-retard and captopril in young, nonobese hypertensive men (HT). In 78 previously untreated HT who were given nifedipine-retard and in 81 HT given captopril, blood pressure (BP), pulse rate, blood glucose, and plasma insulin levels were measured every 30 min for 2 h after 75 g oral glucose ingestion, every year for 5 years. Twenty-six age- and body mass index (BMI)-matched normotensive men (NT) were measured for the same variables for 5 years. They were also measured for total cholesterol, triglyceride levels, and lipids fractions after an overnight fast, every year for 5 years without any kinds of lipid lowering agents. At 1 year after treatment with nifedipine-retard or captopril, BP decreased significantly, and the reductions in BP did not differ between HT treated with nifedipine-retard and captopril. In the entry period, fasting insulin (P < .05), the area under the curve (AUC) of insulin (P < .01), AUC of blood glucose (P < .05) after 75 g oral glucose ingestion, fasting total cholesterol (P < .05), and triglyceride levels (P < .05) in HT were significantly greater than those in NT. In HT treated with captopril, AUC of insulin (P < .01), AUC of blood glucose (P < .05), and total cholesterol (P < .05) decreased significantly after 1 year of treatment for HT, and triglyceride (P < .05) decreased significantly after the 2 year treatment. Although in HT treated with nifedipine-retard, AUC of insulin (P < .01) and AUC of blood glucose levels (P < .05) decreased significantly after 1 year of treatment, triglyceride and total cholesterol levels did not decrease throughout the 5 years. These results indicate that captopril has ameliorative effects in hyperinsulinemia or reduced insulin sensitivity, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertriglyceridemia starting at 1 year after the treatment for HT, whereas nifedipine-retard has an ameliorative effect in the metabolism of glucose but not in the metabolism of lipids. Therefore, ACE inhibitor has additional ameliorative effects on insulin sensitivity to the vasodilatory action.", 
    "218": "Glomerular hyperfiltration may be important for the development of essential hypertension. Both the renin-angiotensin system and the sympathetic nervous system influence renal hemodynamic regulation. To test the hypothesis that glomerular hyperfiltration can be unmasked by sympathetic nervous system activation, renal hemodynamics and humoral components of the renin-angiotensin system were examined at rest and during mental stress in 45 young normotensive healthy subjects and 37 young people with mild essential hypertension. GFR and renal plasma flow (RPF) were determined with inulin and para-aminohippuric acid clearance at rest and during stress. At rest, RPF, GFR, filtration fraction, plasma renin activity, angiotensin (Ang) II concentrations, and serum aldosterone values were similar in normotensive and hypertensive subjects. After stress, blood pressure increased (P < 0.01), but this was nearly identical in normotensive and hypertensive subjects (7.05 +/- 6.9 versus 7.03 +/- 4.6 mmHg, NS). The decrease in RPF (-27 +/- 54 versus -22 +/- 25 ml/min per 1.73 m2, NS) was also similar in the two groups. In contrast, the increase in GFR (+ 10.5 +/- 7.2 versus 6.08 +/- 5.7 ml/min per 1.73 m2, P < 0.001) and filtration fraction (+2.48 +/- 1.38 versus 1.82 +/- 1.49%, P < 0.05) was more marked in hypertensive than in normotensive subjects. The concomitant increase in Ang II concentrations was greater in hypertensive than in normotensive subjects (+4.6 +/- 1.0 versus -1.0 +/- 0.45 pg/ml, P < 0.001). The increase in GFR during mental stress was correlated with the increment in Ang II concentrations (r = 0.39, P < 0.001). Compared with the placebo control phase, blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor attenuated the increase in GFR during stress in hypertensive (8.04 +/- 5.01 versus 10.1 +/- 5.7 ml/min per 1.73 m2, P < 0.05), but not in normotensive, subjects. Even in early essential hypertension, glomerular hyperfiltration is evident during sympathetic nervous system activation, which is mediated by postglomerular vasoconstriction. This early stress-induced glomerular hyperfiltration may contribute to, or trigger, the development of essential hypertension.", 
    "219": "Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) is composed of two highly similar domains (referred to here as the N and C domains) that play a central role in blood pressure regulation; ACE inhibitors are widely used in the treatment of hypertension. However, the negative regulator of hematopoiesis, N-acetyl-seryl-aspartyl-lysyl-prolyl (AcSDKP), is a specific substrate of the N domain-active site; thus, in addition to the cardiovascular function of ACE, the enzyme may be involved in hematopoietic stem cell regulation, raising the interest of designing N domain-specific ACE inhibitors. We analyzed the inhibition of angiotensin I and AcSDKP hydrolysis as well as that of three synthetic ACE substrates by wild-type ACE and the N and C domains by using a range of specific ACE inhibitors. We demonstrate that captopril, lisinopril, and fosinoprilat are potent inhibitors of AcSDKP hydrolysis by wild-type ACE, with K(i) values in the subnanomolar range. However, of the inhibitors tested, captopril is the only compound able to differentiate to some degree between AcSDKP and angiotensin I inhibition of hydrolysis by wild-type ACE: the K(i) value with AcSDKP as substrate was 16-fold lower than that with angiotensin I as substrate. This raises the possibility of using captopril to enhance plasma AcSDKP levels with the aim of normal hematopoeitic stem cell protection during chemotherapy and a limited effect on the cardiovascular function of ACE.", 
    "220": "The present study investigated whether or not nitric oxide (NO) synthesis mediates mechanisms regulating activation of renin formation. Studies were performed on afferent arterioles freshly isolated from the rat kidney. We have shown previously that this preparation is a useful model to study regulation of renin synthesis and secretion. The expression of renin mRNA was assessed by ribonuclease protection assay, and total renin content and renin secretion by radioimmunoassay. In afferent arterioles isolated from rats treated with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril, renin mRNA levels, total renin content and renin secretion were increased threefold compared to untreated controls. Inhibition of NO-synthase by NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) in the ramipril-treated rats, abolished the increase in renin mRNA levels, total renin content and renin secretion. In other animals furosemide, a diuretic acting on macula densa cells, activated renin synthesis to a level similar to that found in the ramipril-treated group. Addition of L-NAME to the furosemide-treated rats suppressed the increases in renin mRNA levels, total renin content and renin secretion, suggesting that NO acts on renin activation by a mechanism independent of angiotensin II. In separate experiments, the inhibitory effect of L-NAME on the activation of renin secretion was abolished when afferent arterioles were treated with nicardipine, an L-type Ca2+ channel blocker, suggesting that the suppression of renin activation during NO inhibition is due to increased Ca2+ entry. Since endothelin is a potent mediator of Ca2+ influx and an inhibitor of renin release, we tested whether or not endothelin could be involved in the inhibitory effect of L-NAME on renin secretion. Application of the endothelin receptor antagonist, bosentan, in vitro mimicked the effect of nicardipine. In addition, bosentan coadministered with L-NAME in vivo blunted the inhibitory effect of L-NAME and restored the increases in renin mRNA level, synthesis and secretion. These data indicate that the physiological mechanism(s) regulating activation of renin synthesis and secretion are impaired during NO inhibition, probably because of increased Ca2+ influx. This increase in calcium flux is mediated at least partially by the action of endothelin.", 
    "221": "This study was undertaken to compare the effects of chronic angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition on blood pressure (BP) and renal hemodynamics in older black and nonblack hypertensive patients with chronic renal insufficiency. A multicenter, placebo lead-in double-blind, parallel group study was performed to compare the antihypertensive efficacy and renal hemodynamic response to the once-daily ACE inhibitor fosinopril (n = 14) and lisinopril (n = 13) over a 22-week period. The study goal was to lower diastolic blood pressure (DBP) to 90 mm Hg or less. Furosemide was added after 6 weeks if blood pressure goal was not achieved. At outpatient clinics at university medical centers, 27 older hypertensive patients (> or = 45 years; 12 blacks, 15 nonblacks; 19 male, eight female) with DBP of 95 mm Hg or higher and 4-hour creatinine clearance 20 to 70 mL/min/1.73 m2 were studied. Changes (delta) from baseline in BP, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and renal plasma flow (RPF) were measured. Mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) and DBP decreased significantly and to a similar extent in randomized groups: fosinopril (mean +/- SEM) delta DBP at 6 weeks was -13 +/- 2 (P < 0.0001; 95% CI, -16 to -9) and at 22 weeks was -12 +/- 2 (P < 0.0001; 95% CI, -16 to -9); lisinopril delta DBP at 6 weeks was -14 +/- 6 (P < 0.0001; 95% CI, -10 to -18) and at 22 weeks was -16 +/- 2 (P < 0.0001; 95% CI, -12 to -21). GFR and RPF did not change significantly in either group. BP was significantly reduced and to a similar extent in blacks and nonblacks: for blacks, delta DBP at 6 weeks was -11 +/- 3 (P < 0.05; 95% CI, -0.01 to -9) and at 22 weeks was -16 +/- 2 (P < 0.0001; 95% CI, -11 to -20); for nonblacks, delta DBP at 6 weeks was -14 +/- 1 (P < 0.0001; 95% CI, -12 to -17) and at 22 weeks was -12 +/- 2 (P < 0.0001; 95% CI, -16 to -8). Eight patients (five blacks and three nonblacks) required an addition of furosemide after 6 weeks to reach the DBP goal of < or = 90 mm Hg at 22 weeks. GFR was not significantly altered for either racial group at 6 weeks; however, at 22 weeks; however, at 22 weeks, GFR decreased significantly in blacks (delta GFR, -16 +/- 5; P < 0.006; 95% CI, -26 to -5) and tended to increase in nonblacks (delta GFR, 7 +/- 6; P > 0.25). delta GFR correlated directly with the delta RPF (delta GFR = 0.0611* delta RPF -2.35 +; r = 0.68; P < 0.003). There was no correlation between delta MAP and delta GFR or delta RPF in blacks or nonblacks. We conclude that chronic ACE inhibition with fosinopril and lisinopril alone or in combination with furosemide lowers BP in older blacks and nonblacks with hypertension and chronic renal insufficiency. Racial differences in the renal hemodynamic response to chronic ACE inhibition were noted and appear to be independent of diuretic use and the magnitude of BP lowering.",

    "228": "In congestive heart failure (CHF), low cardiac output decreases the fullness of the arterial circulation. This underfilling of the arterial vascular compartment unloads the baroreceptors, resulting in a sequence of events to maintain arterial circulatory integrity. Among them, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis, the sympathetic nervous system, the non-osmotic release of vasopressin and the endothelins are activated to increase vascular resistance and enhance sodium and water renal retention. Simultaneously, vasodilatory and natriuretic substances such as the natriuretic peptides are activated to counterregulate these vasoconstrictors. In the initial phase of CHF, these events contribute to the cardiorenal adaptation. However, when CHF progresses, they become maladaptive and further depress vantricular performance and increase sodium and water retention. This vicious cycle of CHF provides the rationale for the use of neurohormonal antagonists in CHF. The beneficial effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in CHF are well described. Vasopressin V1 receptor antagonists have been associated with peripheral vasodilation and improved cardiac function in some patients with CHF. In CHF animals, the vasopressin V2 receptor antagonist has been demonstrated to reverse the defect in water excretion. Bosentan, an endothelin antagonist, is associated with an increase of cardiac index in patients with CHF. A role for exogenous natriuretic peptides is also under investigation. Modulation of the neurohumoral systems associated with CHF opens a new perspective in the treatment of cardiac edema, principally by improving cardiac performance.", 
    "229": "We enzymatically deglycosylated pig lung angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) to study the involvement of its glycanic chains in its physicochemical and catalytic properties. The effects of endoglycosidases F2 and H, and of N-glycanase were assessed by ACE mobility in SDS-PAGE. N-Glycanase only was completely effective with or without previous denaturation, leading to a shift in ACE M(r) from 172 to 135 kDa; endoglycosidase F2 produced the same shift but only without previous denaturation. Deglycosylated ACE had the same kcat as native ACE for the substrate hippuryl-histidyl-leucine, and an identical Stokes radius as measured by size-exclusion high performance liquid chromatography. Neuraminidase had no effect on ACE Stokes radius but slightly decreased its kcat which could be related to variations in ionization of the active site. The isoelectric point of ACE, as, determined by isoelectric focusing, increased from 4.5-4.8 to 5.0-5.3 after either endoglycosidase F2 or neuraminidase digestion, but still with microheterogeneities which thus did not seem to be related to ACE glycans. Deglycosylated ACE did not bind onto agaroselectins in contrast to native ACE which bound strongly to concanavalin A showing interactions involving oligomannosidic or biantennary and sialylated N-acetyl-lactosaminic isoglycans. Finally, tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-glycosylation, did not modify ACE secretion by endothelial cells. Thus, ACE glycans have no drastic effects on structural and biological properties of the protein, but they may have a functional role on intracellular targeting of both secreted and membrane-bound ACE isoforms, also for the protection of the soluble plasma form against hepatic lectins and the maintenance of its hydrosolubility.", 
    "230": "There are several theories on the cause of ACE inhibitor-induced cough, but the exact mechanism is not known. In many patients, if cough develops, the ACE inhibitor can be discontinued and a drug in another therapeutic class used in its place. However, in patients with CHF, diabetic nephropathy, and patients who have experienced a myocardial infarction, discontinuing the ACE inhibitor may not be in the best interest of the patient. In this patient population it would be reasonable to try cromolyn sodium to treat cough, while continuing the ACE inhibitor. Data are not available to support the efficacy of cromolyn sodium to treat cough in patients with diabetic nephropathy, but these patients clearly benefit from the use of an ACE inhibitor. Other factors not addressed in the case reports and the clinical trial such as patient adherence, cost, and quality of life should also play a role in the decision to use cromolyn sodium. Cromolyn sodium has been effective for the treatment of ACE inhibitor-induced cough in many case reports and has had mild success in one small clinical trial. Although none of the reports adequately assessed adverse effects, studies examining cromolyn for other indications have demonstrated a relatively benign adverse effect profile. It is difficult to recommend an exact dose to use because of the dosing variability in the case reports. The majority of the case reports and the one clinical trial used dosages similar to recommendations for bronchial asthma (i.e., 2 puffs [1.6 mg] 4 times daily via MDI or 20-mg capsules 4 times daily via breath-activated inhalation). At this time, the use of cromolyn sodium is a viable option, but more controlled studies are needed to fully elucidate its role in the treatment of ACE inhibitor-induced cough.", 
    "231": "We undertook the present study to examine the effect of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril, the angiotensin II antagonist losartan, and calcium antagonist verapamil on systolic pressure and spontaneous blood glucose levels in rats from the Cohen-Rosenthal diabetic hypertensive strain. Genetic hypertension and diabetes developed in this strain after crossbreeding of Cohen diabetic and spontaneously hypertensive rats. The new rat strain was fed their usual copper-poor sucrose diet, which is essential for the development of this model, and for 4 weeks received either enalapril, losartan, or verapamil. Systolic pressure was reduced significantly compared with controls in all treated groups. Chronic treatment with enalapril or verapamil, but not with losartan, succeeded in lowering spontaneous blood glucose, indicating improved diabetic control. Data suggest that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition by enalapril, but not angiotensin II antagonism by losartan, can improve glucose metabolism in addition to its hypotensive effect in a genetic diabetic hypertensive rat strain. This confirms that the drop in glucose with converting enzyme inhibition is highly dependent on bradykinin accumulation. Data further suggest that calcium channel blockade by verapamil can also improve glucose metabolism. The question remains whether the reduction in glucose by verapamil was a result of inhibition of glucogenesis.", 
    "232": "This study was designed to determine whether angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors play a role in cardioprotection in a human model of preconditioning.", 
    "233": "Recent studies have suggested that bradykinin may contribute to the protective effects of preconditioning in animal models. ACE inhibitors are known to inhibit the degradation of bradykinin and hence may be able to potentiate the effect of preconditioning.", 
    "234": "We examined the effects of the ACE inhibitors captopril and lisinopril in combination with a subthreshold preconditioning stimulus (i.e., insufficient to have any protective effects alone). Human atrial trabeculae were superfused with Krebs buffer and paced at 1 Hz. They were subjected to a full or subthreshold preconditioning stimulus consisting of either 3 or 1.5 min of simulated ischemia and 7 min of reoxygenation. In each instance, this stimulus was followed by 90 min of simulated ischemia and 2 h of reoxygenation. In addition, the subthreshold preconditioned group had 20 min of previous ACE inhibitor treatment.", 
    "235": "Recovery of contractile function (percent of baseline) was 22 +/- 1% (mean +/- SEM) in the control group versus 61 +/- 1% in the preconditioned group. The subthreshold preconditioned group and the ACE inhibitor-alone groups did not exhibit any protection; however, in combination, the protection was significant (71 +/- 4% in the captopril group, 58 +/- 8% in the lisinopril group, p < 0.005) compared with the control group. There was no significant difference between these values and recovery after the full preconditioning stimulus. Furthermore, Hoe 140, a specific bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist, abolished the protection.", 
    "236": "To our knowledge, these are the first results in human muscle to suggest that ACE inhibitors may augment ischemic preconditioning, possibly through B2 receptor activation.", 
    "237": "A review of recent studies suggests that the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may be preferred (usually along with a diuretic drug) as initial therapy in several subsets of hypertensive patients (i.e., those with diabetes and nephropathy or with diminished left ventricular function with or without symptoms of heart failure). Limited long-term data are available for the angiotensin II receptor antagonists. The use of nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocking agents (CCBs) appears to reduce reinfarction in patients with ischemic heart disease (however, mortality is not reduced). Long-acting formulas of CCBs appear to decrease congestive heart failure in patients with dilated, but not ischemic, cardiomyopathy and to decrease strokes and arrhythmias in hypertensive subjects. Short-acting agents (primarily those that increase heart rate) may increase coronary heart disease events in hypertensive patients. There is little evidence at present that CCBs offer a major advantage over other antihypertensive agents or that they should be recommended as initial therapy, except in special situations.", 
    "238": "Lisinopril, like other ACE inhibitors, lowers blood pressure and preserves renal function in hypertensive patients with non-insulin-dependent or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM or IDDM) and early or overt nephropathy, without adversely affecting glycaemic control or lipid profiles. On available evidence, renoprotective effects appear to be greater with lisinopril than with comparator calcium channel blockers, diuretics and beta-blockers, despite similar antihypertensive efficacy. As shown by the EUCLID (EUrodiab Controlled trial of Lisinopril in Insulin-Dependent Diabetes) trial, lisinopril is also renoprotective in normotensive patients with IDDM and microalbuminuria. The effect in normotensive patients with normoalbuminuria was smaller than in those with microalbuminuria, and no conclusions can yet be made about its use in patients with normoalbuminuria. In complications other than nephropathy, lisinopril has shown some benefit. Progression to retinopathy was slowed during 2 years' lisinopril therapy in the EUCLID study. Although not yet fully published, these results provide the most convincing evidence to date for an effect of an ACE inhibitor in retinopathy. The drug may also improve neurological function, but this finding is preliminary. Lastly, post hoc analysis of the GISSI-3 trial indicates that lisinopril reduces 6-week mortality rates in diabetic patients when begun as early treatment after an acute myocardial infarction. The tolerability profile of lisinopril is typical of ACE inhibitors and appears to be similar in diabetic and nondiabetic individuals. Hypoglycaemia has occurred at a similar frequency with lisinopril and placebo, as shown in the EUCLID trial. In addition, the GISSI-3 study indicates that the incidence of persistent hypotension and renal dysfunction is increased with lisinopril in general, but the presence of diabetes does not appear to confer additional risk of these events in diabetic patients with acute myocardial infarction receiving lisinopril. In summary, lisinopril lowers blood pressure and produces a renoprotective effect in patients with IDDM and NIDDM without detriment to glycaemic control or lipid profiles. Like other ACE inhibitors, lisinopril should thus be viewed as a first-line agent for reducing blood pressure and preventing or attenuating nephropathy in hypertensive diabetic patients with IDDM or NIDDM and microalbuminuria or overt renal disease. The EUCLID study, using lisinopril, provides new data supporting an additional place in managing normotensive patients with microalbuminuria and IDDM. These findings, together with some evidence for an effect of lisinopril in delaying progression of retinopathy and in reducing mortality, suggest a broader role for the drug in managing diabetic vascular complications.", 
    "239": "1. Cardiovascular effects of submaximal antihypertensive doses of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, ramipril (0.25 mg kg-1 day-1 in the food), and the calcium channel blocker, felodipine (0.4 mg kg-1 day-1 subcutaneously by osmotic minipump), both alone and in combination, were examined in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) in a four-week study. 2. Both ramipril and felodipine as monotherapy decreased systolic blood pressure. The antihypertensive effect of the drug combination was more than that of ramipril treatment alone, but not significantly better than that of felodipine monotherapy. Ramipril or felodipine treatments did not significantly affect the heart rate, either alone or in combination. 3. The beneficial effect of ramipril monotherapy on left ventricular hypertrophy was more prominent than that of felodipine. The cardioprotective effect of felodipine was improved when combined to ramipril. The systolic blood pressure at the end of the experimental period correlated only weakly with left ventricular hypertrophy. 4. Responses of mesenteric arterial rings in vitro were examined at the end of the four-week study. Ramipril and felodipine monotherapies as well as their combination markedly improved the endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation responses to acetylcholine. The combination of ramipril and felodipine slightly enhanced the endothelium-independent vascular relaxation responses to sodium nitroprusside. Ramipril treatment alone slightly diminished the vascular contractile responses to noradrenaline. Neither ramipril nor felodipine alone or in combination affected the vascular contractile responses to potassium chloride. 5. Ramipril treatment, both alone and in combination with felodipine, caused a three fold increase in plasma renin activity. Serum aldosterone, fasting blood glucose level, serum insulin and the 24 hour urinary excretions of sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, phosphorus or protein were not significantly affected by the drug treatments. 6. Our findings suggest that a better overall control of hypertension and end-organ damages, without an increase in adverse effects, can be achieved by the combination of submaximal antihypertensive doses of felodipine and ramipril than by monotherapy with either drug alone.", 
    "240": "1. Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors slows the rate of progression of nephropathy in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) with streptozotocin-induced diabetes. Paradoxically, however, chronic ACE inhibitor therapy has been reported to be associated with induction of ACE in the plasma. We sought to determine whether induction also occurred in the glomerulus. 2. Seven days after induction of diabetes rats were randomized to receive perindopril (4 mg/kg per day) in the drinking water or water alone. Blood glucoses were maintained 6-10 mmol/L by daily ultralente insulin. Rats were killed after 1 and 12 weeks of ACE inhibitor therapy and the kidneys were harvested. Angiotensin-converting enzyme activity was determined in isolated glomeruli before and after removal of perindopril and reconstitution with zinc sulphate. 3. After 1 week of ACE inhibitor therapy, glomerular ACE was significantly greater after removal of perindopril than either before its removal (P < 0.025) or in the untreated controls (P < 0.025). After 12 weeks of therapy, ACE activity was significantly lower in the perindopril-treated group than in the untreated controls (P < 0.025). There was no increase in ACE activity following removal of perindopril. 4. These studies suggest that short-term ACE inhibition is associated with induction of ACE in the glomerulus. However, there was no increase in ACE activity after removal of perindopril, suggesting that induction of synthesis of this enzyme in the glomerulus does not occur during chronic ACE inhibition.", 
    "241": "1. In the present study the role of angiotensin II (AngII) in the development of cardiac hypertrophy in diabetes combined with hypertension was investigated. 2. Diabetes was induced in 8-week-old male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) by intravenous injection of streptozotocin (45 mg/kg bodyweight). Diabetic SHR were treated with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor ramipril at a dose of 0.4 mg/kg per day. 3. Twelve weeks following the onset of diabetes, hearts were arrested in diastole and were perfusion-fixed. The right ventricle and left ventricle plus septum were weighted and the volume of the ventricular walls was determined using the Cavalieri principle. 4. Induction of diabetes in SHR led to a significant reduction in bodyweight compared with non-diabetic control SHR and this was not affected by ramipril treatment. The development of hypertension was not as great in diabetic SHR compared with controls, such that at 12 weeks following the onset of diabetes systolic blood pressure (SBP) averaged 191 +/- 3 and 230 +/- 4 mmHg in diabetic SHR and controls, respectively. Ramipril treatment significantly lowered SBP in diabetic SHR. 5. The left ventricle plus septum volume:bodyweight ratio (LV vol:BW) was significantly higher in diabetic SHR compared with controls (3.83 +/- 0.19 and 3.26 +/- 0.16 mm3/g, respectively). Ramipril treatment did not affect growth of the left ventricle in diabetic SHR with the LV vol:BW ratio averaging 3.95 +/- 0.14 mm3/g. Similar trends on growth were observed in the right ventricle. 6. In conclusion, the development of cardiac hypertrophy in diabetic SHR appears to occur by mechanisms independent of AngII and the elevation of blood pressure.",

During this period, the level of microalbuminuria in these patients was assessed in triplicate 24-h urine samples on at least four separate visits. All patients had stable metabolic control and controlled blood pressure during follow-up. Microalbuminuria was defined as an albumin-to-creatinine ratio in 24-h urine of between 3 and 30 mg/mmol. The individual rates of progression of microalbuminuria were calculated from linear regression analysis.

In stepwise multiple regression analysis, a high triglyceride-to-HDL cholesterol ratio at baseline (P = 0.006) and the use of ACE inhibitors (P = 0.007) were identified as the only independent predictors of progression of microalbuminuria.",

We studied the distribution of angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE), Ang II, Ang II receptor subtypes, and vasopressin in the hypothalamus of adult male mice. Autoradiography of binding of the ACE inhibitor [125I]351A revealed low levels of ACE throughout the hypothalamus. Ang II- and vasopressin-immunoreactive neurons and fibers were detected in the paraventricular, accessory magnocellulary, and supraoptic nuclei, in the retrochiasmatic part of the supraoptic nucleus and in the median eminence. Autoradiography of Ang II receptors was performed using [125I]Sar1-Ang II binding. Ang II receptors were present in the paraventricular, suprachiasmatic, arcuate and dorsomedial nuclei, and in the median eminence. In all areas [125I]Sar1-Ang II binding was displaced by the AT1 receptor antagonist losartan, indicating the presence of AT1 receptors. In the paraventricular nucleus [125I]Sar1-Ang II binding was displaced by Ang II (Ki = 7.6 X 10(-9)) and losartan (Ki = 1.4 X 10(-7)) but also by the AT2 receptor ligand PD 123319 (Ki = 5.0 X 10(-7)).

    "259": "This study describes the development and comparison of two HPLC methods for the analysis of the antihypertensive drug captopril. The first method is based on a precolumn derivatization of captopril with the fluorescent label monobromobimane (MBB). The second method is based on a postcolumn reaction with the fluorescent reagent o-phthaldialdehyde (OPA). Since the disulfide metabolites of captopril can be reconverted to the active drug in vivo, the bioanalysis of captopril should involve both the determination of its free thiol form (free captopril) and the total amount of free thiol and reducible disulfides (total captopril). For total captopril analysis, disulfides were reduced with tributylphosphine (TBP) prior to protein precipitation. Since the reducing agent interfered with the MBB derivatization reaction, this method was not suitable for total captopril analysis. Both methods were validated for the bioanalysis of free captopril in human plasma. After removal of plasma proteins, samples were analyzed without an additional extraction procedure. The limit of quantitation in plasma was 12.5 ng/ml for the MBB method (limit of detection 30 pg) and 25 ng/ml for the OPA method (limit of detection 50 pg). The OPA method was also validated for total captopril analysis in human plasma and urine. The limit of quantitation was 25 ng/ml in plasma and 250 ng/ml in urine (limit of detection 50 pg). We conclude that for the analysis of free captopril the precolumn MBB method is superior to the OPA method since only the derivatization reaction has to be carried out immediately. The postcolumn OPA method is especially suitable for the analysis of total captopril since reducing reagents and high concentrations of endogenous thiols do not interfere with the derivatization reaction.", 
    "260": "As it is extremely unstable in blood, the thiol compound BMS186716 was stabilized by the addition of methyl acrylate (MA) to blood samples. The blood samples were then kept in ice for 10-15 min for completion of the Michael addition reaction to occur between the thiol group of BMS186716 and MA, after which the plasma was separated by centrifugation under refrigeration. For sample analysis, the standard and quality control samples were prepared by spiking blank plasma with the BMS186716-MA adduct. After addition of the internal standard, BMS 188035-MA, each sample was acidified with HCI and then extracted with methyl tert.-butyl ether. Each reconstituted extract was injected into a high-performance liquid chromatography-positive ion electrospray ionization mass spectrometric system. The electrospray condition was chosen to enhance the [M+NH4]+ signal at the expense of the [M+H]+ signal. Monitoring the [M+NH4]+ signal, a lower limit of quantitation of 2.5 ng/ml was achieved, with 0.5 ml plasma. We have thus shown that a sulfhydryl compound (BMS186716) in blood can successfully be stabilized by reacting it with MA and that the adduct produced is adequately stable in blood and plasma to allow the development of a rugged quantitative bioanalytical method.",

    "265": "Mutations have been introduced in the cytosolic glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) from Bacillus stearothermophilus in order to convert its cofactor selectivity from a specificity towards NAD into a preference for NADP. In the B-S mutant, five mutations (L33T, T34G, D35G, L187A, P188S) were selected on the basis of a sequence alignment with NADP-dependent chloroplastic GAPDHs. In the D32G-S mutant, two of the five mutations mentioned above (L187A, P188S) have been used in combination with another one designed from electrostatic considerations (D32G). Both mutants exhibit a dual-cofactor selectivity at the advantage of either NAD (B-S) or NADP (D32G-S). In order to analyse the cofactor-binding site plasticity at the molecular level, crystal structures of these mutants have been solved, when complexed with either NAD+ (D32G-Sn, resolution 2.5 A, R = 13.9%; B-Sn, 2.45 A, 19.3%) or NADP+ (D32G-Sp, 2.2 A, 19.2%; B-Sp, 2.5 A, 14.4%). The four refined models are very similar to that of the wild-type GAPDH and as expected resemble more closely the holo form than the apo form. In the B-S mutant, the wild-type low affinity for NADP+ seems to be essentially retained because of repulsive electrostatic contacts between the extra 2'-phosphate and the unchanged carboxylate group of residue D32. Such an antideterminant effect is not well compensated by putative attractive interactions which had been expected to arise from the newly-introduced side-chains. In this mutant, recognition of NAD+ is slightly affected with respect to that known on the wild-type, because mutations only weakly destabilize hydrogen bonds and van der Waals contacts originally present in the natural enzyme. Thus, the B-S mutant does not mimic efficiently the chloroplastic GAPDHs, and long-range and/or second-layer effects, not easily predictable from visual inspection of three-dimensional structures, need to be taken into account for designing a true \"chloroplastic-like\" mutant of cytosolic GAPDH. In the case of the D32G-S mutant, the dissociation constants for NAD+ and NADP+ are practically reversed with respect to those of the wild-type. The strong alteration of the affinity for NAD+ obviously proceeds from the suppression of the two wild-type hydrogen bonds between the adenosine 2'- and 3'-hydroxyl positions and the D32 carboxylate group. As expected, the efficient recognition of NADP+ is partly promoted by the removal of intra-subunit electrostatic repulsion (D32G) and inter-subunit steric hindrance (L187A, P188S). Another interesting feature of the reshaped NADP+-binding site is provided by the local stabilization of the extra 2'-phosphate which forms a hydrogen bond with the side-chain hydroxyl group of the newly-introduced S188. When compared to the presently known natural NADP-binding clefts, this result clearly demonstrates that an absolute need for a salt-bridge involving the 2'-phosphate is not required to switch the cofactor selectivity from NAD to NADP. In fact, as it is the case in this mutant, only a moderately polar hydrogen bond can be sufficient to make the extra 2'-phosphate of NADP+ well recognized by a protein environment.", 
    "266": "Ozone was applied to sealed red cell ghost membranes at the rate of 95 nmol/min for periods up to 20 min. Acetylcholine esterase, on the outer face of the membrane, was inhibited up to 20%. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, on the inner surface of the membrane, was inhibited up to 87%. These differences reflected the inherent susceptibilities of the two enzymes and the presence or absence of the membrane barrier. Analysis of the total lipids of the ozone-treated ghosts showed no significant change in the distribution of lipid classes and no significant change in the fatty acid composition. There was no significant change in the fatty acid composition of the phosphatidylcholine fraction. There was a slight increase in 18:0 and 20:2 + 20:3 in the phosphatidylethanolamine fraction. There was no change in the molecular species distribution of the phosphatidylcholine or the phosphatidylethanolamine fraction. There was no evidence for the formation of the phospholipid ozonolysis product, 1-acyl-2-(9-oxo-nonanyl) derivatives of glyceryl-phosphoryl choline. There was no decline in the amount of cholesterol in the lipids derived from ozone-treated red cell membranes. Treatment of red cell ghost membranes and, by implication, the plasma membrane of cells by ozone therefore oxidizes peripheral proteins before it oxidizes lipids.",

However, poor biological stability and cellular delivery represent potential limitations to the therapeutic development of oligonucleotides. Conjugation of oligonucleotides to lipophilic groups can improve delivery to cells but the enhanced cellular binding may also facilitate nonspecific interactions. In this report, we show that phosphorothioate oligonucleotides conjugated to lipophilic groups, either tocopherol (Vitamin E) or 2-Di-O-hexadecyl-3-glycerol, can significantly inhibit the functioning of the dipeptide transporter system (DTS) in cultured Caco-2 intestinal cells. Because the DTS mediates the binding and absorption of nutrient peptides and important drugs, such as the cephalosporin and penicillin antibiotics, this finding has important implications in relation to the potential toxicity of lipophilic conjugates in vivo. It also suggests a potential drug interaction with lipophilic oligonucleotide-conjugates if they were to be delivered orally.",

Furthermore, a 3-minute mental stress test and a cold pressor test were performed before and 90 minutes after drug administration. Resting MSA did not change after captopril and decreased compared with placebo (P < .05 versus placebo), whereas isosorbide dinitrate led to a marked increase in MSA (P < .05). Systolic blood pressure was reduced by isosorbide dinitrate (P < .05), whereas captopril decreased diastolic blood pressure (P < .05). The increases in MSA, blood pressure, and heart rate during mental stress were comparable before and after drug administration regardless of the medication. During cold pressor test, MSA and systolic and diastolic blood pressures increased to the same degree independent of treatment, but after isosorbide dinitrate, the increase in MSA seemed to be less pronounced. Heart rate did not change during cold stimulation. Plasma renin activity increased after captopril and isosorbide dinitrate (P < .05), whereas placebo had no effect. Endothelin-1 increased after placebo and isosorbide dinitrate (P < .05) but not after captopril.", 
    "271": "Thus, captopril suppressed MSA despite lowering of diastolic blood pressure but allowed normal adaptation of the SNS during mental or physical stress. In contrast, the nitrate strongly activated the SNS under baseline conditions. These findings demonstrate that vasodilators differentially interact with the SNS, which could be of importance in therapeutic strategies for the treatment of patients with cardiovascular diseases.", 
    "272": "Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is now recognised as an effective approach for the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure (CHF). Today, it is possible to antagonise the effects of angiotensin II more specifically by blocking its receptors using non-peptide receptor antagonists. These compounds, which at first were used to identify the various subtypes of angiotensin II receptors, are now available clinically. Some of them have recently been launched on the market and several others are preregistered for the treatment of hypertension. These new molecules are as effective as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors at lowering blood pressure in hypertensive patients, and appear to have similar systemic and renal haemodynamic properties in patients with CHF and renal diseases. Large-scale clinical trials such as the LIFE, the ELITE and the RENAAL studies are now underway to investigate the long-term benefits of one of these agents in hypertension, heart failure and Type II diabetic nephropathy. The major clinical advantage of AT1 receptor antagonists is that, in contrast to ACE inhibitors, they do not induce cough. With the more widespread use of AT1 receptor antagonists, two unresolved questions remains unanswered: what is the role of AT2 receptors? Are the unblocked effects of angiotensin II on AT2 receptor sites of any clinical relevance to the safety profile or efficacy of AT1 receptor antagonists? Another interesting question is whether the combination of an ACE inhibitor with an AT1 receptor antagonist is advantageous. Studies attempting to answer these questions are underway and will certainly enable researchers to define more precisely the role and the advantages of these new specific non-peptide AT1 receptor antagonists in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure.", 
    "273": "The effects of blockade of the renin-angiotensin system at three different sites on regression of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) were investigated in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist, renin inhibitor, or the combination of hydralazine and hydrochlorothiazide was administered for 7 days to SHRs to obtain the same decrease in blood pressure. Treatment with ACE inhibitor, AT1 receptor antagonist, or renin inhibitor significantly decreased left ventricular mass. On the other hand, hydralazine administration failed to diminish LVH in SHRs. These findings indicate that blockade of the renin-angiotensin system regressed LVH irrespective of the site of the blockade and independent of hemodynamic changes.", 
    "274": "After two weeks of a wash-out run-in period with placebo, 131 patients with congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class II to III) and left ventricular ejection fraction </=40% were randomly assigned to a treatment period of 4 weeks with 10 mg quinapril once daily or 12.5 mg captopril twice daily. At the end of this period, doses were titrated to 20 mg quinapril once daily or 25 mg captopril twice daily on the basis of physician judgment if there were no major adverse reactions and if blood pressure was not below 110/70 mm Hg. Clinical symptoms of heart failure were significantly relieved by both drugs at the end of a 12-week treatment period. At the beginning of the study, 23 (35%) of the 65 patients taking quinapril and 27 (41%) of the 66 patients taking captopril were in NYHA functional class III, whereas, at the end of the trial, only 4 (6%) of the patients in the quinapril group and 14 (22%; p < 0.05 versus quinapril) patients in the captopril group were classified as NYHA class III. Both drugs had a positive effect on echocardiographic parameters. There was a statistically significant increase in exercise duration in both treatment groups (quinapril, 6.2 +/- 1.8 versus 7.8 +/- 1.9 minutes, p < 0.001; captopril, 5.9 +/- 1.9 versus 7.1 +/- 2.3 minutes, p < 0.001). One patient in the quinapril group died suddenly during the study and two patients in the captopril group dropped out of the study due to persistent dry cough. No patient in the quinapril group reported side effects. Three patients in the captopril group suffered from moderate dry cough, one from taste-blindness, and another from unstable angina. The safety of the tested drugs was confirmed by laboratory tests. Quinapril was as effective as captopril in reducing signs and symptoms of heart failure and in improving the left ventricular function and the exercise capacity with few side effects.", 
    "275": "This study was designed to determine whether pyrazinoylguanidine (PZG) can attenuate cataract development in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. After a single, intraperitoneal dose of STZ (45 mg/kg in 0.05 mol/l sodium citrate buffer), Sprague-Dawley rats (250-260 g) were divided into three groups. Beginning a week later, each group of diabetic rats received twice daily for 24 weeks by gavage one of the following: vehicle (saline 10 ml/kg), PZG (35 mg/kg), or captopril (15 mg/kg). PZG treatment prevented the development of diabetic cataracts (p = 0.0009 compared to vehicle). In contrast to PZG, 38% of vehicle-treated rats exhibited cataracts after 12 weeks, increasing to 89% after 16 weeks. At week 16, 22% of captopril-treated rats exhibited cataracts, a 75% reduction from vehicle-treated rats (p = 0.4289 compared to vehicle; p = 0.0571 compared to PZG). These results indicate that captopril can attenuate cataract formation in STZ-diabetic rats, whereas PZG completely suppresses it.", 
    "276": "This study was designed to determine whether pyrazinoylguanidine (PZG) can attenuate diabetic nephropathy in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. Diabetes was induced within 1 week after a single intraperitoneal dose of STZ (45 mg/kg in 0.05 mol/l sodium citrate buffer). Diabetic rats were divided into five groups. Each group received by gavage for 24 weeks one of the following: vehicle (saline 10 ml/kg, b.i.d.), PZG (35 mg/kg, b.i.d.), captopril (15 mg/kg, b.i.d.), or hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ, 20 mg/kg, b.i.d.). Insulin (NPH 7.5 U/day) was given subcutaneously. PZG treatment for 24 weeks reduced mortality and attenuated diabetic nephropathy, as indicated by reduced urinary excretion of total protein (79% of control), low-molecular-weight protein (12% of control), and albumin (60% of control). PZG also preserved renal structure and function. Compared to HCTZ or vehicle-treated rats, STZ-diabetic rats receiving either captopril or insulin exhibited decreased excretion of total protein, low-molecular-weight protein, and albumin, as well as amelioration of renal pathology. Collectively, these results indicate that PZG, as well as captopril and insulin, improved longevity and several indices of diabetic nephropathy in STZ-diabetic rats.", 
    "277": "The antihypertensive and metabolic effects of lisinopril 20 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg in fixed combination were compared with those of captopril 50 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg in fixed combination in a double-blind clinical trial. After a 3-week placebo run-in period, two parallel groups of hypertensive patients (188 patients in total) each received one treatment once a day for 6 weeks. Blood pressure was measured with a mercury sphygmomanometer and on two occasions by 24 h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). Results indicate that both treatments have similar effects on casual blood pressure measurements, while ABPM recordings show that the lisinopril 20 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg combination is more effective during the last period of the dosing interval. Lisinopril 20 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg as combination antihypertensive treatment does not induce alterations in serum potassium and triglycerides.", 
    "278": "In this double blind randomized study, blood pressure lowering effects and duration of action of two angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors were compared using home self blood pressure measurement (SBPM). After a two-week placebo run-in period, 128 hypertensive patients received during four weeks a daily morning dose of either perindopril (P) 4 mg or trandoplapril (T) 2 mg. One week of SBPM was planned at the end of both the run-in and the treatment period. Three consecutive measurements, with printed results, were requested in the morning before drug intake and in the evening. Run-in period home systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressures were comparable in both groups: 149.9 +/- 14.5/97.3 +/- 8.1 mmHg in the P group (n = 63), 148.9 +/- 14.3/96.7 +/- 6.9 mmHg in the T group (n = 65). During the treatment period, evening BP was similar in the 2 groups: 139.1 +/- 14.3/89.9 +/- 9.1 mmHg in P group, 137.5 +/- 15.3/89.4 +/- 9.1 mmHg in T group (NS). On the other hand, morning BP was higher in the P group: 143.1 +/- 16.3/93.8 +/- 9.6 mmHg vs 137.4 +/- 16.7/90.3 +/- 9.7 mmHg (p < 0.05 for SBP and DBP-Student's t test). These results were confirmed by co-variance analysis after adjustment on initial BP. Due to standardized conditions of measurement, home SBPM was able to show a difference in BP lowering effects at the end of the inter-dose interval between two ACE inhibitors.", 
    "279": "This study examined ninety-six patients with essential arterial hypertension (WHO grade I-II) who had been under treatment for a period of at least one year before participating in the study. When the study began the patients received no drug treatment for one month. At the end of this washout period their basal situation was evaluated and drug treatment was begun (26 patients on calcium antagonists, 39 on beta-blockers and 31 on angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors). The patients were evaluated again after one and two years of uninterrupted treatment with the chosen medication. The results obtained indicate that in a basal situation hypertensive patients have higher blood viscosity and erythrocyte rigidity values than the control group. Regardless of the drug treatment used, the patients experienced during the study a progressive deterioration of their hemorheological situation consisting of an increase in red blood cell rigidity and increased blood viscosity. These results indicate the importance of evaluating the hemorheological parameters of hypertensive patients and suggest that it may be advisable to include in their treatment some kind of medication that prevents progressive rheological deterioration.", 
    "280": "The effects of captopril (2 mg/kg i.p.) and cadmium (1 mg/kg i.p.) at three different time points (30, 60, 180 min) on serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were examined in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Captopril produced significant inhibition of ACE at 60 and 120 minutes, while maximum fall of BP (15 mm Hg) was obtained at 30 minutes post-test drug treatment. Heart rate at the three different time intervals did not change significantly. ACE levels in the serum were significantly reduced at different time intervals (30, 60, 120 min) in the cadmium-treated group as compared with controls (p < 0.05). Cadmium increased the blood pressure and heart rate of rats. The results indicate that while both cadmium and captopril produce different effects on blood pressure and heart rate, both of these also inhibit the serum ACE in rats.", 
    "281": "Large-scale studies have indicated that treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduces the incidence of myocardial infarction and unstable angina pectoris among patients with recent myocardial infarction and moderate left ventricular dysfunction. An improved endogenous fibrinolysis might be responsible for this effect.",

    "283": "Fifty-six patients with acute myocardial infarction and a wall motion index < or = 1.2 were allocated randomly either to administration of trandolapril or to placebo. When possible, the study drug dose was increased gradually to 4 mg trandolapril or a corresponding amount of placebo during the first month after randomization. Blood samples for determination of the variables of the fibrinolytic system, ACE activity and ACE genotype were collected prior to randomization and during out-patient visits in months 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12. After the subject had fasted overnight, blood samples were collected in the morning (0800-1000 h) after the subject had rested supine for at least 15 min, from a venous cannula inserted into the forearm. The effect of trandolapril on the fibrinolytic variables was evaluated by calculating the area under the curve (AUC1-12) from month 1 to month 12.", 
    "284": "The trandolapril group and the placebo group were similar with respect to baseline clinical characteristics, baseline fibrinolytic variables and baseline plasma ACE activity. The trandolapril group did not differ significantly from the placebo group with respect to AUC1-12 t-PA antigen [11.67 (3.95-26.45) versus 10.34 ng/ml (3.71-19.62), P = 0.19] and AUC1-12 plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) antigen [27.57 (8.38-89.49) versus 24.40 ng/ml (7.94-90.62), P = 0.92]. A significant and clear trend in variation with time of t-PA antigen was observed for the trandolapril group, but not for the placebo group. The fibrinolytic variables were similar at baseline for the different ACE genotype insertion (I) and deletion (D) groups (II, ID and DD). Trandolapril treatment was associated with a significant (P < 0.04) increase in the AUC1-12 of t-PA antigen in the ID group compared with that of the placebo-treated ID group, whereas PAI-1 antigen concentration did not differ between the groups. Trandolapril treatment was not associated with any significant change in the fibrinolytic variables for the other genotype groups.", 
    "285": "Chronic ACE-inhibitor treatment with trandolapril was not associated with any significant difference in the blood concentrations of t-PA and PAI-1 compared with placebo. The suggested specific interaction between ACE inhibition and the increase in t-PA in patients with ACE genotype ID will require further confirmation.", 
    "286": "We investigated the angiotensin II (Ang II)-generating system by analyzing the vasoconstrictor effect of Ang II, angiotensin J (Ang I), and tetradecapeptide (TDP) renin substrate in the absence and presence of inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system in isolated rat aortic rings and mesenteric arterial beds with and without functional endothelium. Ang II, Ang I, and TDP elicited a dose-dependent vasoconstrictor effect in both vascular preparations that was completely blocked by the Ang II receptor antagonist saralasin (50 nM). The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril (36 microM) completely inhibited the vasoconstrictor effect elicited by Ang I and TDP in aortic rings without affecting that of Ang II. In contrast, captopril (36 microM) significantly reduced (80-90%) the response to bolus injection of Ang I, without affecting those to Ang II and TDP in mesenteric arteries. Mechanical removal of the endothelium greatly potentiated (70-95%) the vasoconstrictor response to Ang II, Ang I, and TDP in aortic rings while these responses were unaffected by the removal of the endothelium of mesenteric arteries with sodium deoxycholate infusion. In addition, endothelium disruption did not change the pattern of response elicited by these peptides in the presence of captopril. These findings indicate that the endothelium may not be essential for Ang II formation in rat mesenteric arteries and aorta, but it may modulate the response to Ang II. Although Ang II formation from Ang I is essentially dependent on ACE in both vessels, our results suggest the existence of an alternative pathway in the mesenteric arterial bed that may play an important role in Ang II generation from TDP in resistance but not in large vessels during ACE inhibition.", 
    "287": "Some of the more important advances in slowing progression of renal disease in the past few years include the following: the identification of specific racial groups, such as African-Americans and Mexican-Americans, who are at higher risk for renal disease progression than the general population; the observation that African-Americans may require lower levels of blood pressure reductions (i.e. < 125/75 mmHg) than the general population in order to achieve a similar degree of protection against renal disease progression; the understanding that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in the early stages of diabetic renal disease and nondihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers in those with established renal insufficiency from diabetes slow renal disease progression and reduce proteinuria; and lastly, aggressive blood pressure reduction in dialysis patients is associated with a reduction in cardiovascular events.", 
    "288": "Previous reports have suggested that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are able to modulate intercellular resistance through an ACE-independent action. Therefore, the aim of our study was to determine whether the ACE inhibitor lisinopril would modulate intercellular resistance of guinea pig ventricular myocytes. Junctional resistance was measured using the double patch-clamp technique in eight cell pairs at baseline and during superfusion with 10(-4) M lisinopril. In these cell pairs, mean junctional resistance (+/-SEM) measured at baseline (14.5 +/- 3.8 M omega) was unchanged (15.0 +/- 3.6 M omega; p > 0.05) during lisinopril even after a 25-min exposure to the drug (n = 3). As well, a 20-min exposure to 10(-6) M lisinopril from the intracellular milieu did not modify the junctional resistance. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that modulation of junctional resistance independent of drug-related ACE inhibition is not observed with lisinopril.", 
    "289": "Alacepril is an inhibitor of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), and is commonly used as an antihypertensive. In this study, the effects of alacepril, its metabolites, desacetylalacepril and captopril, and also lisinopril, which has no sulfhydryl group in the structure, on free radicals were examined in vitro, using an ESR method. Superoxide and hydroxyl radical scavenging activities of alacepril metabolites, desacetylalacepril and captopril, were observed, whereas lisinopril hardly scavenged the superoxide or the hydroxyl radicals. Alacepril and its metabolites did not scavenge nitric oxide, but lisinopril showed slight scavenging activity. These findings suggest that the biological action of alacepril may be partly due to the antioxidant effect of its metabolites, having a sulfhydryl group.", 
    "290": "A self-interpreted control chart, on an individualized basis, assesses the effect of a switch from beta-blockers to an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitor in a patient with occasional blood pressure (BP) excess. In dense and long data series, the BP and heart rate (HR) of this patient respond to the change in treatment by the test criterion of a self-starting Cumulative Sum (cusum), which reaches values outside a decision interval with a lowering of BP and an increase in HR and vice versa, at least for BP, after treatment cessation. Thereafter, minimal sampling requirements are sought in the same data by applying the same control chart approach to decimated data. Skeleton sampling schemes in a system of chronobiologic self-analysis and interpretation of manually recorded data obtained at strategically placed times (established on the basis of data decimations) could complement control charts that are used on a home computer or preferably would be built into the output of ambulatory monitors used at the outset as a minimum and routinely as an optimum.", 
    "291": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduce mortality and morbidity in patients with congestive heart failure. These effects may be mediated, at least in part, by suppression of lethal ventricular tachycardia (VT). The aims of this study were to examine whether the ACE inhibitor cilazapril reduces ventricular arrhythmia in patients with congestive heart failure and, if cilazapril does reduce ventricular arrhythmia, to determine whether this reduction is associated with suppression of sympathetic nerve activity in these patients. Thirty-two congestive heart failure patients (left ventricular ejection fraction, 35 +/- 6%; New York Heart Association class II or III) with VTs (Lown grade IVa or IVb) were randomly assigned to receive either conventional therapy, consisting of diuretics and digitalis (control group), or conventional therapy plus cilazapril (cilazapril group). Twenty-four-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring was performed at baseline and after 2 months of therapy. Plasma norepinephrine levels and heart rate variability (standard deviation about the mean RR interval) were compared at baseline and after 2 months of treatment. The control group demonstrated no significant change in arrhythmia frequency after 2 months of treatment. In the cilazapril group, however, the number of ventricular couplets and VT runs was significantly decreased. In association with this reduction, plasma norepinephrine levels were decreased, and heart rate variability was increased. These results suggest that cilazapril has antiarrhythmic effects, which may be produced by suppressing high sympathetic activity, in patients with congestive heart failure. It should be noted that the study group was small and that, although ventricular dysrhythmia was reduced with therapy, it remained substantial. Further study is needed to verify these results and to determine the exact causes of the reduction.", 
    "292": "The effects of 4 weeks of treatment with doxazosin or enalapril on diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and plasma lipid levels were studied in 160 patients 18 to 50 years old with mild-to-moderate hypertension. Comparing baseline measurements with measurements taken after 4 weeks, DBP was significantly reduced by 6.8 +/- 7.4 (mean +/- SD) mm Hg and 12.0 +/- 7.1 mm Hg in the doxazosin and enalapril groups, respectively. Systolic blood pressure was significantly decreased from baseline to end of treatment in both groups. There were no significant changes in heart rate from baseline to end of treatment in the doxazosin group, but there was a statistically significant decrease in heart rate in the enalapril group. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased statistically significantly in the doxazosin group but not in the enalapril group. A decrease in triglycerides was statistically significant with respect to the doxazosin group and was close to significance for the enalapril group. Forty-nine (62%) patients in the doxazosin group and 43 (54%) patients in the enalapril group reported at least one adverse event. Significant reductions in DBP after 4 weeks of treatment were achieved by both drugs, each taken once daily. This reduction was more pronounced in the enalapril group 24 hours postdose, with a mean final daily dose of 2.8 mg of doxazosin and 12.6 mg of enalapril. However, even relatively short-term treatment with low-dose doxazosin showed a more favorable effect on lipids than did enalapril.", 
    "293": "HieACE, a soluble 70 kDa protein related to the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) has recently been identified, characterized and cloned from the adult buffalo fly (Haematobia irritans exigua). HieACE is enzymatically similar to the mammalian ACEs and its predicted amino acid sequence has 42% identity with the mammalian testicular ACEs. In adult H.i. exigua, HieACE expression is restricted to the compound ganglion and posterior midgut, and the maturing male reproductive system. Western blot analysis was used to investigate the expression of HieACE and its homologues in the larvae of H.i. exigua, Drosophila melanogaster, the sheep blowfly (Lucilia cuprina), the Old World screwworm fly (Chrysomya bezziana) and a secondary strike fly, Chrysomya rufifacies. Dipteran ACE homologues of 65-70 kDa were detected in all the larval instars investigated. Most of the immunoreactive proteins were concentrated in the soluble fraction. The first and second larval instars of L. cuprina and C. bezziana appeared to express two ACE homologues. These larvae were also found to secrete (or excrete) the ACE homologue in larval cultures. The presence of ACE-like enzymes in these larvae was confirmed by the measurement of carboxydipeptidase activity that was inhibited by the specific ACE inhibitor, captopril. The tissue distributions of the ACE homologues in the third instar larvae of H.i. exigua and L. cuprina were examined. As in adult H.i. exigua, HieACE was detected in the larval ganglion, but in contrast to the restricted distribution in the adult stage midgut, HieACE was found throughout the digestive system, and in the salivary glands of H.i. exigua larvae. The expression pattern in the gut of L. cuprina larvae was similar despite the differences in diet and habitat. The most striking difference from the adult stage H.i. exigua was the expression of HieACE and its L. cuprina homologues in the hindgut and Malpighian tubules of these larvae. These results suggest that the role(s) played by the dipteran ACE-like enzymes differ between the adult and larval stages.", 
    "294": "A rapid, simple and sensitive assay was developed for determination of captopril in human serum. We employed silica gel cartridge for efficient extraction of captopril adduct from human serum. Captopril was trapped with p-bromophenacyl bromide (pBPB) to give captopril-pBPB adduct. A 4-ml benzene extract of 1 ml acidified serum was passed through 1 ml silica gel cartridge. Potential interfering compounds were removed with 4-ml benzene wash. The captopril-pBPB adduct was eluted with 0.5 ml acetonitrile. Of this acetonitrile solution (100 microliters) was injected on an ODS reverse phase HPLC column (chromatography conditions; mobile phase; acetonitrile-water-acetic acid (225:270:5, v/v/v), flow rate; 1 ml min-1, detection; UV at 263 nm). It is found that this method is accurate and does not require time consuming evaporation-concentration steps. Recovery exceeds 94% and analytical responses are linear over captopril concentration range from 50 up to 1000 ng ml-1. The coefficients of variation from 108 ng ml-1 to 605 ng ml-1 varied between 3.7-7.7% and the relative error did not exceed 3.7%. Therefore, this method can be used for routine clinical monitoring and in pharmacokinetic studies of captopril.", 
    "295": "Utibapril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor with a proposed tissue-specific inhibitory profile. This implies that at a certain dose, utibapril should be able to inhibit tissue ACE activity without affecting plasma ACE. Moreover, if tissue ACE activity is rate limiting, functional conversion of angiotensin I should be decreased. Accordingly, we studied the dose-dependent effect of long-term treatment with utibapril on plasma and tissue ACE. Normal Wistar rats were randomly allocated to oral treatment with different doses of utibapril (0, 2, 10, 50, or 250 micrograms/kg/day) for 30 days. Tissue inhibition of ACE was assessed biochemically, whereas functional conversion of angiotensin I was determined in the isolated organ. Utibapril significantly inhibited plasma, renal, and vascular ACE but not ventricular ACE activity. Notably, however, only treatment with the highest dose of utibapril resulted in a significant inhibition of plasma ACE, whereas vascular ACE activity was already significantly inhibited after treatment with a lower dose of utibapril. In accordance, utibapril dose-dependently inhibited the contraction of isolated aortic rings to angiotensin I. Furthermore, angiotensin I-induced decreases in coronary flow in the isolated heart were significantly inhibited after treatment with the higher doses of utibapril. These data suggest the preferential inhibition of vascular ACE by utibapril in normal rats. Furthermore, the dose-dependent inhibition of the functional conversion of angiotensin I indicates that the tissue ACE activity may be rate limiting in vascular beds in rats.", 
    "296": "We studied the effects of common antihypertensive regimens on autonomic cardiovascular control. We considered calcium channel antagonists (nicardipine twice a day and isradipine once a day, respectively) and also examined, as reference treatments, once-a-day atenolol and cilazapril. A noninvasive evaluation of autonomic cardiovascular profile was obtained with spectral analysis of RR interval and systolic arterial pressure variability. We studied moderate essential hypertensives before and after 2 weeks of treatment, both at rest and during active standing and mental arithmetic. All treatments reduced arterial pressure equally well; however, marked differences in spectral profiles were observed. The low-frequency spectral component of RR interval variability [in normalized units, marker of sympathetic modulation of the sinoatrial (SA) node] tended to be greater at rest and during stimuli (p < 0.001) in subjects treated with dihydropyridines. No differences at rest, but striking increases of the low-frequency component of systolic arterial pressure variability were observed in nicardipine-treated patients during both standardized excitatory stimuli, suggesting a marked increase in sympathetic vasomotor drive. As to reference treatments, patients treated with atenolol displayed the lowest values, and patients treated with cilazapril (for 4 weeks) provided intermediate values. In conclusion, shorter acting dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists may induce an exaggerated increase in sympathetic vasomotor drive during standardized laboratory stressors.", 
    "297": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the antihypertensive effect of drugs according to the initial ambulatory blood pressure (BP) level. After a 15-day placebo run-in period, 105 patients with moderate essential hypertension (mean age, 52 years) underwent 24-h BP monitoring (spacelabs: 1 measure/15 min). Patients were subdivided into two groups: the \"High\" group, with 24-h mean values of systolic BP (SBP) > 137 or diastolic BP (DBP) > 87 mm Hg, and the \"Low\" group, with SBP < or = 137 and DBP < or = 87 mm Hg. All patients received, in a random and double-blind design, either bisoprolol (10 mg q.d.) or lisinopril (20 mg q.d.) for 8 weeks. At the end of this active treatment period, office and ambulatory BP measurements were performed. Casual measurements revealed similar BP decreases in all subgroups receiving bisoprolol and lisinopril; BP monitoring showed that the antihypertensive effect depended on the baseline mean 24-h value; -15/-12 mm Hg for bisoprolol and -18/-13 mm Hg for lisinopril in the High group; -7/-6 mm Hg for bisoprolol and -6/-6 mm Hg for lisinopril in the Low group. This study shows that the antihypertensive effect depended on initial ambulatory BP values, with a lower BP decrease in the Low group. Assessment of the antihypertensive effect on ambulatory BP is useful in clinical trials.", 
    "298": "Despite advances in medical treatment, the annual mortality associated with severe heart failure remains over 40%, and even in mild heart failure the associated mortality is 40% over 4 years. Once it has been demonstrated that the morbidity and mortality to heart failure can be adequately addressed by combinations of drug therapy, then it is logical to attempt to strip out redundant components of these therapeutic regimes. In the meantime, however, combination therapy is required to counter many of the pathophysiological facets of the heart failure syndrome, including fluid retention, neuroendocrine activation, progressive ventricular dysfunction, and sudden cardiac death. Diuretics and ACE inhibitors are well-established drug treatments. Digoxin appears to lessen the rate of progression of heart failure without altering survival. New evidence suggests that beta-blockers may be useful additions to the heart failure therapeutic armamentarium, although whether all beta-blockers are equally effective remains to be established.", 
    "299": "ACE inhibitors have been shown to be effective in reducing the morbidity and mortality of patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction, but their application to clinical practice in this situation is still limited. In part, the failure to prescribe an ACE inhibitor to a patient with left ventricular systolic dysfunction is due to perceptions regarding their side effects, such as cough and renal dysfunction. Relatively few patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction and a serum creatinine > or = 2 mg/dl receive an ACE inhibitor in clinical practice. In this situation one should consider an agent such as fosinopril, which is metabolized by the liver as well as secreted by the kidney. In patients with moderate renal dysfunction, fosinopril has been well tolerated without an increase in serum creatinine. In patients who develop cough due to an ACE inhibitor, consideration should be given to an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocking agent, such as losartan. The relative safety and efficacy of an ACE inhibitor compared with an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocking agent is being explored in a prospective randomized trial (Evaluation of Losartan In The Elderly [ELITE]), as well as the safety and pharmacological effectiveness of adding an angiotensin II receptor antagonist to an ACE inhibitor (Randomized Angiotensin receptor antagonists-ACE-inhibitor Study [RAAS]). There may also be a role for the combination of an aldosterone receptor antagonists and an ACE inhibitor in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Once an ACE inhibitor is administered to a patient with left ventricular systolic dysfunction it should be continued indefinitely. ACE inhibitors may be of value not only in preventing the progression of heart failure but also in reversing endothelial dysfunction and preventing the development of atherosclerosis and its consequences, such as myocardial infarction.", 
    "300": "Diuretics, either as monotherapy or in combination with other drugs in the management of hypertension, have retarded the development of left ventricular hypertrophy and congestive heart failure in many patients. Diuretics also remain one of the most effective therapies in the treatment of congestive heart failure, when given with an ACE inhibitor and digoxin.", 
    "301": "The predominant venodilator properties of the nitrates and their augmentation of collateral coronary blood flow to the ischemic myocardium endows them with some ideal characteristics for treating myocardial ischemic syndromes. Additional efficacy stems from the ability of the nitrates to replenish the deficient endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF), nitric oxide (NO), in patients with coronary heart disease and also to inhibit platelet aggregation. In stable angina pectoris, the antianginal and antiischemic effects of oral nitrates are well established. Continuous administration of nitrates may lead to tolerance of their clinical efficacy. Recent studies, however, have demonstrated that when used in recommended doses, tolerance can be avoided during long-term treatment with oral nitrates without provocation of anginal attacks during periods of low nitrate levels at night and early hours of the morning. Thus, prolonged treatment with an asymmetric twice-daily regimen of immediate-release isosorbide-5-mononitrate in patients with stable angina pectoris does not give rise to clinical tolerance, prolongs exercise duration, and delays the onset of myocardial ischemia. In unstable angina pectoris, nitrates rapidly relieve chest pain and ameliorate the electrocardiographic signs of myocardial ischemia. In patients with acute myocardial infarction, early treatment with nitrates prevents left ventricular dilatation, improves pumping function, and reduces the risk of ventricular arrhythmias. In patients with chronic heart failure, oral nitrates improve exercise tolerance and, when given in combination with the systemic arterial dilator hydralazine, extend survival. Meta-analysis of published studies has demonstrated that both intravenous and oral nitrates reduced infarct size and morbidity and mortality in patients with acute myocardial infarction. In the ISIS 4 post-infarction study, isosorbide-5-mononitrate 60 mg once daily was not superior to placebo in reducing mortality risk. However, in the GISSI 3 study, the combination of nitrates with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor reduced mortality risks by 17% in patients with acute myocardial infarction. In both the ISIS 4 and GISSI 3 studies, 62% and 57% of the patients in the placebo and control groups, respectively, were treated with nitrates for control of rest angina, myocardial ischemia, and or left ventricular failure symptoms, and this widespread use of open-label nitrates in the control groups may have diluted the true beneficial effects of nitrates in both studies. Taken together, these many studies with oral nitrate treatment in coronary heart disease and heart failure clearly emphasize that these drugs are safe and play more than a symptomatic role in the management of patients with acute and chronic ischemic syndromes due to coronary artery disease.", 
    "302": "Chronic angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition with enalapril or angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor antagonism with either losartan (specific for Ang II type-1 receptor, AT1) or PD 123319 (specific for the Ang II type-2 receptor, AT2) were effected between postnatal days 3 and 21 in the rat. Following quantitative analysis of the kidneys using recently developed unbiased stereological techniques we found that none of the treatments resulted in changes in glomerular number or size. This implies that inhibition of Ang II activity had no effect on postnatal nephron induction or glomerular development. However, following both chronic ACE inhibition and AT1 antagonism, abnormalities of tubules and their associated vessels were evident throughout the kidney and were accompanied by an increased proportion of interstitium. The structural abnormalities were most prominent in the outer medulla and were consistent with interruption of descent of the loops of Henle and vasa rectae. In contrast, no renal morphological abnormalities were observed following chronic AT2 antagonism.", 
    "303": "The present study was designed to compare the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and calcium antagonists-the two drug classes thought to be most effective in reducing left ventricular hypertrophy-on arterial pressure, left ventricular structure and function in patients with essential hypertension. After a placebo period of 4 weeks, a population of 96 patients were treated either with one of five different ACE inhibitors or one of six different calcium antagonists. Cardiac structure and function was assessed by 2D-guided M-mode echocardiography. Whereas both drug classes lowered arterial pressure to the same extent, ACE inhibitors had a more pronounced effect on posterior and septal wall thickness and left ventricular mass index than calcium antagonists. Diastolic function, as measured by peak filling rate and duration of rapid filling, improved in both treatment groups to the same extent. However, systolic performance, as assessed by midwall fractional fibre shortening, was significantly improved by ACE inhibitors only. Myocardial contractility (end-systolic wall stress/end-systolic volume index) showed no significant change in the ACE inhibitor group but decreased after treatment with calcium antagonists. We conclude that both calcium antagonists and ACE inhibitors lower arterial pressure and increase left ventricular filling to the same extent. However, compared with calcium antagonists, ACE inhibitors had a more pronounced effect on left ventricular mass and improved systolic ventricular performance in patients with essential hypertension.", 
    "304": "The effects of 10 weeks of treatment with atenolol (n = 9) or the converting enzyme inhibitor zofenopril (n = 25) on plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) were studied in 34 essential hypertensive patients. After 4 weeks on placebo, pretreatment ANP, 56 +/- 7 pg/ml, was slightly but not significantly higher than that of 29 controls (41 +/- 4) and correlated with age (r = 0.44), ECG score for left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) (r = 0.51) and serum creatinine (r = 0.67), and negatively with creatinine clearance (r = -0.39). Atenolol reduced blood pressure (BP) by 0 +/- 6/8 +/- 2 mm Hg (ns/P < 0.01), and zofenopril by 14 +/- 4/6 +/- 2 (P < 0.01/P < 0.01), not significantly different between the two agents. Heart rate was decreased by atenolol (-16 +/- 4 bpm, P < 0.01) but not by zofenopril (+1 +/- 2 bpm, ns). Atenolol increased ANP in all patients but one (delta = +42 +/- 9 pg/ml, P < 0.01), while zofenopril did not change it significantly (-6 +/- 6 pg/ml), due to 15 patients exhibiting decreases and 10 increases in plasma ANP. The effect of atenolol on ANP positively correlated with duration of hypertension (r = 0.74), ECG score for LVH (r = 0.73) and serum creatinine (r = 0.68). Individual changes in ANP by zofenopril negatively correlated with pretreatment ANP (r = -0.69), ECG score for LVH (r = -0.44) and serum creatinine (r = -0.41). No correlations were found between BP, heart rate or their changes by treatment and the effect of either agent on plasma ANP. Multiple linear regression showed that the change in ANP was explained by the therapeutic agent used, the pretreatment plasma level of ANP, and the ECG score for LVH (F = 12.5, P < 0.001, r2 = 0.56). We conclude that the effect of antihypertensives on plasma ANP is independent of their action on BP, but dependent on an interaction between the type of drug employed and those clinical characteristics of the patient that reflect pre-existing hypertensive target organ damage.", 
    "305": "The Syst-Eur trial is a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled therapeutical trial in patients at least 60 years old and with isolated systolic hypertension. Its scope is to investigate the effects of modern antihypertensive drug treatment on morbidity and mortality and to assess possible adverse effects of the drugs used. Patients were recruited in 22 countries in western and eastern Europe and Israel. At three run-in visits 1 month apart their sitting systolic blood pressure (SBP) on single-blind placebo treatment averaged 180-219 mm Hg with diastolic blood pressure (DBP) lower than 95 mm Hg. After stratification for sex and the presence of cardiovascular complications, the patients were randomized either to active treatment or placebo. Active treatment consisted of nitrendipine (10-40 mg/day) with the possible addition of enalapril (5-20 mg/day) and/or hydrochlorothiazide (12.5-25 mg/day), titrated or combined to reduce the sitting SBP by at least 20 mm Hg to below 150 mm Hg. Matching placebos were employed similarly. The present progress report is based on the data received at the Coordinating Office before 1 March 1996. At that time 3433 subjects had been randomized. A total of 2015 patients had been followed for at least 1 year on double-blind treatment and 1298 patients for at least 2 years. At baseline BP was similar in both treatment groups and averaged 174/86 mm Hg. According to a per-protocol analysis at 1 year, BP fell (P < 0.001) on average by 22.6 +/- 15.7/6.0 +/- 8.0 mm Hg in the active treatment group and by 12.2 +/- 15.9/1.7 +/- 7.3 mm Hg in the placebo group. At 2 years BP was 10.2/5.7 mm Hg lower (P < 0.001) on active treatment than on placebo. At 1 year the percentage of patients who had reached goal BP was 19.9% in the placebo group and 41.4% in the active treatment group. At 2 years these percentages were 20.9 and 43.2 respectively.",

Coronary artery ligation induced decrease in cardiac output and increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. Valsartan at 10 mg/kg i.v. reduced blood pressure, heart rate, left ventricular pressure, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and total systemic resistance. Similar changes were observed with enalaprilat at 0.1 mg/kg i.v. Rapid left ventricular pacing for 2 weeks reduced cardiac contractility. Valsartan, administered at a dose of 100 mg/kg/d p.o. for 2 weeks, lowered left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. Valsartan reduced preload and afterload in these two dog heart failure models.",

Four weeks after ligation, mean blood pressure, left ventricular pressure and cardiac output decreased, while left ventricular end-diastolic pressure increased in control rats. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure significantly decreased in rats treated with valsartan at 30 mg/kg/d p.o. for 4 weeks. Total systemic resistance remarkably decreased in those with enalapril 3 mg/kg/d p.o. and valsartan 30 mg/kg/d p.o. Valsartan and enalaprilat did not affect cardiac functions of isolated intact rat hearts before and after ischemia in Langendorff apparatus. In addition to hemodynamic effects observed in vivo, valsartan at 30 mg/kg p.o. significantly inhibited left ventricular hypertrophy. Valsartan would thus appear to be clinically useful for treating heart failure following myocardial infarction.",

In contrast to enalapril, this drug did not potentiate bradykinin-induced depressor response. In anesthetized dogs, valsartan at 10 mg/kg i.v. significantly increased renal blood flow, urinary sodium and chloride excretion and urine volume and significantly decreased renal vascular resistance and filtration fraction without affecting blood pressure. The preferential effects on renal hemodynamics were confirmed by the increase in blood flow into the kidneys of spontaneously hypertensive rats at 3 h following oral administration.",

During 48 weeks, control rats showed increase in systolic blood pressure from 180 to 250 mmHg accompanying stroke-related behaviour, cardiac and aortic hypertrophy, hyperreactive contractility of mesenteric vascular beds, proteinuria, high water turnover and death. Valsartan at 3, 10 and 30 mg/kg/d p.o. and enalapril at 1 and 10 mg/kg/d p.o suppressed the increase in blood pressure dose-dependently. Systolic blood pressure was steadily controlled to around 180 mmHg at the highest dose of either drug throughout the study. In proportion to the antihypertensive action of the drugs, end-organ damage was prevented. During 1-year administration, effects of enalapril and valsartan were much the same, indicating the clinical usefulness of valsartan being comparable to enalapril.",

In normotensive rats and deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)/salt hypertensive rats, valsartan had no effect on blood pressure. Single oral administrations of valsartan at doses of 3-30 mg/kg reduced blood pressure dose-dependently in renal (2 kidney 1 clip, 2K1C) hypertensive and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Repeated oral administrations of valsartan to these hypertensive rats controlled blood pressure throughout a treatment period of 4 weeks, and showed no rebound phenomenon following drug withdrawal. This drug at 30 mg/kg p.o. decreased blood pressure in renal (2K1C) hypertensive dogs by single and repeated administrations. The extent and duration of the hypotensive action of valsartan were similar to those of enalapril. Valsartan would thus appear as useful as enalapril.", 
    "311": "Diabetic nephropathy is a major cause of renal failure, accounting for 20% of patients starting dialysis. In clinical trials, effective blood-pressure control, especially by angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), retards the rate of progression of renal failure substantially. We examined these effects in clinical practice by surveying patients at a joint diabetes renal clinic at Glasgow Royal Infirmary from 1989 to 1995. We examined the relationship between progression of diabetic nephropathy, mean arterial pressure (MAP), and the use of ACEIs. The average MAP of the whole group of patients fell by 7%, the urine albumin:creatinine ratio fell by 29%, and the rate of progression as measured by the slope of reciprocal of serum creatinine with time (l/mumol/day) was slowed, from -4.59 to -2.76. This is equal to delaying the necessity for dialysis by about 2 years. The joint clinic met its aim and was cost-effective.", 
    "312": "Scar tissue found at the site of myocardial infarction (MI) contains phenotypically transformed fibroblast-like cells termed myofibroblasts (myoFb). In injured cardiac tissue, autoradiography and immunolabeling have localized high density angiotensin (Ang) converting enzyme (ACE) and Ang II receptor binding to these cells, suggesting that they may regulate local concentrations of Ang II and transduce signals at this site. Ang II is known to modulate type I collagen gene expression of fibroblasts and myoFb, and to promote fibrous tissue contraction, each of which may contribute to tissue repair. It is unknown whether myoFb themselves generate Ang peptides de novo via expression of angiotensinogen (Ao), an aspartyl protease needed to convert Ao to Ang I, and ACE. We therefore isolated and cultured myoFb from 4-week-old scar tissue of the adult rat left ventricle with transmural MI. In cultured myoFb we found: (a) immunoreactive membrane-bound ACE, cytosolic cathepsin D (Cat-D), and AT, receptors by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy, (b) mRNA expression for Ao, ACE, and Cat-D, but not renin, by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, (c) production of Ang I and II in serum-free culture media; (d) absence of renin activity; (e) a time-dependent conversion of Ao to Ang I by myoFb cytosol, which was inhibited by pepstatin A, but not by renin inhibitor; and (f) significant increase in Ang II production (P < 0.05) by exogenous Ao and Ang I (10 nM), which was significantly blocked by lisinopril (0.1 microM: P < 0.05). Thus, cultured myoFb express requisite components and are able to generate Ang I and II de novo. In an autocrine and/or paracrine manner, Ang II may regulate myoFb collagen turnover and fibrous tissue contraction.", 
    "313": "The presence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is associated with an increased incidence of arrhythmias. Our previous study on hypertrophied rat hearts has demonstrated that regression of LVH prevents ischemia-induced lethal arrhythmias. To elucidate the underlying mechanism of the reduced incidence of arrhythmias in regression of LVH, we examined electrophysiological properties of both hypertrophied and regressed left ventricular cells. Hearts from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were used as LVH, and those from Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) served as control. SHR with regression of LVH (REG) was produced by captopril treatment. Action potentials and membrane currents of subendocardial left ventricular cells were compared by the whole-cell patch-clamp techniques. Although the membrane capacitance of SHR cells was significantly greater than that of WKY cells, that of REG cells was normalized to the control level. Prolonged action potential duration (APD) and reduced density of transient outward current (ito) in SHR cells was normalized by LVH regression (APD at 75% repolarization (ms) and ito density at +60 mV (pA/pF): WKY 36.1 +/- 4.2, 11.9 +/- 1.3, SHR 73.1 +/- 12.9, 5.2 +/- 0.7, REG 29.5 +/- 3.9, 10.4 +/- 2.0, P = 0.015, P = 0.001 v WKY). No significant differences were observed in the densities of steady-state outward current, inward rectifier current, and L-type Ca2+ current. The restoration of ito density by regression of LVH could normalize the prolonged APD in hypertensive LVH, which may be causally related to the reduced incidence of arrhythmias in LVH regression.", 
    "314": "Patients with heart failure are often inadequately investigated and treated in general practice. To improve the management of heart failure locally we initiated a specialist clinic in 1994. After its first 18 months, we audited the outcome of general practitioners' referrals to the clinic to examine its effectiveness in improving the diagnosis and treatment of heart failure. Eighty-five patients were referred with suspected heart failure. However, only 48% had echocardiographic evidence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Following referral, 80% of these patients were given a trial of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors compared with 27% before referral. Six patients were receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors unnecessarily, and five patients had significant structural cardiac disorders. Referral to a specialist clinic improved the accuracy of diagnosis and the number of patients on appropriate treatment. Greater use of open access echocardiography prior to referral might have allowed a more selective (and cost-effective) utilisation of the clinic.", 
    "315": "Recent studies have described intracellular binding sites for angiotensine II. In vascular smooth muscle it was found that intracellular injection of angiotensin II increases the Ca2+ level. An alternative method for intracellular delivery of drugs is represented by using liposomes. Thus, the aim of this study was to characterize liposomes filled with angiotensinogen, angiotensine I (Ang I), angiotensine II (Ang II), and saralasin by a TLC method and examine the physiological effects of these on rat vascular smooth muscle. Ang II (for all concentrations tested in the aqueous phase) and Ang I (for concentrations less than 10(-4)M) did not affect the thin-layer chromatography migration of this type of vesicle, suggesting that dose-dependent effects on physio-pharmacological experiments could be studied. On the other hand, this type of experiment could not be performed for salarasin- or angiotensinogen-filled liposomes. Administration of liposomes containing Ang II (10(-6)M), Ang I (10(-6)M), angiotensinogen (10(-6)M) and saralasine (10(-6)M) caused the contraction to isolated rat aorta smooth muscle, suggesting the presence of active intracellular binding sites.", 
    "316": "We report a case of a renin-producing juxtaglomerular cell tumor and the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril or angiotensin II receptor antagonist TCV-116. A 19-year-old female visited our clinic because of hypertension (162/122 mmHg). Plasma renin activity (PRA) was 25 ng/ml/h and plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) was 880 pg/ml. Abdominal sonography revealed a low echoic tumor in the center of the right kidney. The mass was shown to have isodensity on a computed tomography scan, iso- or slightly lower intensity on T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and low intensity on T2-weighted MRI. Renal angiography disclosed a hypovascular tumor. Plasma renin activity was not decreased in response to oral administration of captopril (50 mg) or TCV-116 (4 mg), which is associated with a marked decrease in PAC and blood pressure. The average of the mean blood pressure determined by an ambulatory monitoring system every hour for 24 h was lowered from 118 +/- 10.6 (SD) to 85 +/- 11.4 mmHg by TCV-116. Plasma renin activity did not show any difference between the right and left renal vein. Removal of the tumor successfully decreased PRA to 0.3 ng/ml/h and PAC to 33 pg/ml, resulting in a decrease in 24-h average of the mean blood pressure to 78 +/- 16.9 mmHg. The tumor was well capsulated and stained with an antibody against mouse renin. In the tumor, but not normal tissues, renin mRNA was detected at 1.6 kb using rat renin cDNA. The content of active renin in the tumor amounted to 182 micrograms/g tissue, which is 109 times higher than that in normal tissue. The plasma- or tumor-inactive renin concentration was 3.6- or 1.8-fold the active renin concentration, respectively. These results suggest that the juxtaglomerular tumor had an MRI image of iso- to low intensity on T1 and low intensity on T2, and that renin secretion from the tumor may be due mainly to the constitutive pathway and angiotensin II receptor antagonist, as well as to ACE inhibitors, and may be very effective for lowering the blood pressure.", 
    "317": "Mitral regurgitation (MR) is a common, frequently asymptomatic valvulopathy that can ultimately lead to left ventricular failure. With the objective of forestalling MR progression, a prospective, placebo controlled, double-blind study was conducted. It measured the effectiveness of lisinopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, in reducing the echocardiographic signs of MR severity over a one-year period. Severe coronary disease was excluded by stress echocardiography. Treatment effectiveness was estimated to be proportional to the reduction in MR fraction and cardiac chamber dimensions, compared with baseline, according to intention-to-treat analysis. A final patient population of 23 asymptomatic adults aged 53.3 +/- 2.4 years (mean +/- SEM), with moderate, organic MR and normal left ventricular function was selected from the echocardiographic database. All baseline patient characteristics were comparable in the two treatment groups, including the MR fraction (55 +/- 3%). Twelve patients received lisinopril (18 +/- 1 mg) and 11 received placebo. After one year of treatment, a statistically significant difference in the MR fraction was observed between the two groups. For the lisinopril group the MR fraction dropped by 6.4 +/- 3.5% and for the placebo group it increased by 3.7 +/- 3.2% versus baseline (P < 0.05). No differences in left atrial or ventricular dimensions were observed. The study drug was stopped in four patients after one patient presented with rapid atrial fibrillation and angina while three patients were intolerant to lisinopril. Only one patient receiving placebo was taken off therapy. In conclusion, treatment with lisinopril indicates some reduction in the severity of chronic moderate MR in asymptomatic patients with normal left ventricular function. This approach appears to be safe, but side effects are not uncommon, warranting regular follow-up.", 
    "318": "The effects of free-radical generating systems and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on the action potentials and contractile force in guinea-pig cardiac muscles were examined using conventional microelectrode and whole-cell voltage-clamp methods at 36 degrees C. Hydrogen peroxide (30-100 microM) prolonged 50%, 75% and 90% repolarization of action-potential duration (APD) approximately 15-25 min after its application. But the longer exposure reversed the APD shortening in a concentration-dependent manner. Other action-potential parameters were not altered to a significant extent. The contractile force was increased. Longer exposure inhibited the enhanced force (but it was still larger than control). The effects on the spontaneous action potential from right atrial muscle were almost the same. In whole-cell voltage-clamp experiments, H2O2 (100 microM) inhibited L-type Ca2+ current and enhanced delayed rectifier K+ current. The effects of light-activated rose bengal (10-100 nM) on the APD were similar to, but more potent than, those of H2O2. The response was observed rapidly after a light illumination. During exposure to rose bengal (100 nM), abnormal spontaneous action potentials or arrhythmias such as a bigeminy occurred, presumably because of early and delayed afterdepolarizations. The responses were irreversible. At 300 microM ACE inhibitors, captopril and enalapril, protected the changes induced by these free radicals. These results indicate that H2O2 has a dual, time-dependent, action on the APD and rose bengal with light illumination produced the responses rapidly. The oxygen-derived free radicals increased [Ca]i and then cellular Ca2+ overload occurred. These responses were protected by ACE inhibitors.", 
    "319": "Hypertension is a common finding in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) nephropathy. African Americans have a high prevalence of NIDDM and hypertension, and are relatively resistant to the antihypertensive effects of converting enzyme inhibitors (CEI) but respond well to calcium channel blockers (CCB). In the long-term study presented here, the effects of isradipine, a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, on the course of the nephropathy were investigated and compared with the effects of captopril in 31 African Americans with NIDDM and proteinuria (> or = 500 mg/day). The patients were stratified by levels of GFR and proteinuria, and they were randomized to receive isradipine (N = 16) or captopril (N = 15); doses were adjusted to maintain similar BP levels (< 140/90). At 6 months, mean arterial pressure was similar (102 +/- 3 and 104 +/- 3 mm Hg in the isradipine and captopril groups, respectively) and GFR was unchanged (delta = -4 +/- 3 and +1 +/- 3 ml/min/1.73 in the isradipine and captopril groups, respectively; P = NS). However, proteinuria in the isradipine group increased by approximately 50% (2.01 +/- 0.40 versus 3.04 +/- 0.70 mg/mg creatinine at baseline versus 6 months, respectively, P < 0.05), whereas captopril reduced proteinuria by 30% after 6 months (2.85 +/- 0.70 at baseline versus 2.30 +/- 0.70 mg/mg creatinine, P < 0.05). Dietary protein, sodium intake, and HbA1C levels were similar in both groups and did not differ from baseline. It was concluded that over 6 months, captopril reduces and isradipine increases proteinuria in African Americans with NIDDM and nephropathy. Whether this contrasting effect on proteinuria will result in different rates of progression is not known, but dihydropyridine CCB should be used cautiously in African Americans with diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "320": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors diminish proteinuria and the progression to renal failure in several experimental models of renal injury. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) possesses potent biological actions on renal vessels and has been considered as a potential mediator of renal damage. Because angiotensin II (Ang II) induces ET-1 synthesis in endothelial and mesangial cells, we hypothesized that some of the beneficial effects of the ACE inhibitors could result from the blockade of ET-1 synthesis. In a normotensive model of immune-complex nephritis, in which there exists an increase in renal ACE activity, the effect of the ACE inhibitor quinapril on preproET-1 and ETA receptor mRNA expression, as well as on ET-1 protein levels, was examined in this study. In relation to controls, nephritic rats showed an increase in preproET-1 and ETA receptor gene expression in renal cortex and medulla, coinciding with the maximal renal ACE activity. PreproET-1 mRNA (in situ hybridization) and ET-1 protein (immunohistochemistry) were localized in glomerular capillary walls, mesangial and glomerular epithelial cells, as well as in the brush border of some proximal tubules, and in small vessels. In nephritic rats, there was an increase in preproET-1 mRNA levels and ET-1 protein in all of these areas, without modification of their distribution. The administration of the ACE inhibitor quinapril decreased proteinuria and morphological lesions, preproET-1 gene transcription, and ET-1 protein levels, as well as the ETA receptor mRNA. The results from this study show that in a normotensive model of immune-complex nephritis, there was an overexpression of ET-1 in several structures of the kidney that was downregulated by quinapril administration. The beneficial effect of ACE inhibitors could be a result of the modulation of local production of Ang II and ET-1.", 
    "321": "We have recently reported that intrarenal nitric oxide (NO) synthesis inhibition exaggerates the preglomerular vasoconstrictor response more than the postglomerular response to angiotensin II (ANG II) in dogs. Previous studies have suggested that preglomerular vasoconstriction may be more dependent on extracellular calcium than postglomerular vasoconstriction. The purpose of this study is to determine whether the enhanced preglomerular response to ANG II during intrarenal NO synthesis inhibition occurs through voltage-gated calcium channels. In three groups of anesthetized dogs with stop-flow kidneys, the renal hemodynamic response to intrarenal ANG II infusion (2.0 ng.kg-1.min-1) was determined. Renal artery pressure was servo-controlled at 80 +/- 1 mmHg, and glomerular filtration rate was zero. In vehicle-treated dogs, ANG II decreased renal blood flow (RBF) by 29% and increased glomerular hydrostatic pressure (Pg) by 2.7 +/- 1.9 mmHg. Postglomerular vascular resistance increased by 51%, whereas preglomerular resistance was unchanged in response to ANG II. In dogs pretreated with an intrarenal infusion of NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; 5 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) for 60 min, ANG II decreased RBF by 36% and decreased Pg 4.4 +/- 2.9 mmHg. In contrast to the vehicle-treated group, preglomerular resistance increased by 261% and postglomerular resistance increased by 48% after ANG II infusion in the L-NAME-treated group. In dogs pretreated with an intrarenal infusion of L-NAME and verapamil (50 micrograms/min) for 60 min, the renal hemodynamic response to ANG II was similar to the response in the vehicle-treated dogs. ANG II decreased RBF by 25% and decreased Pg by 5.3 +/- 1.2 mmHg. Postglomerular resistance increased by 51%, whereas preglomerular resistance was unchanged in response to ANG II infusion in dogs with intrarenal NO synthesis and voltage-gated calcium channel blockade. These data indicate that the preglomerular response to ANG II under conditions of reduced NO synthesis within the kidney is dependent on voltage-gated calcium channels.", 
    "322": "Elimination of baroreceptor afferent input to the brain produced by chronic lesion of nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) does not alter vasopressin (VP) release during hypotensive hemorrhage in conscious rats. To investigate whether the kidneys play a critical role in stimulating VP release during hemorrhage in chronic NTS-lesioned rats, we examined the effects of removing potential signals arising from the kidneys. In NTS-lesioned rats, nephrectomy or renal denervation, but not captopril injection, markedly attenuated (but did not abolish) hemorrhage-induced VP release. In contrast, none of these manipulations attenuated the VP response in NTS-intact rats. Hemorrhage increased plasma renin activity in control and NTS-lesioned rats, and this response was not altered by renal denervation. In rats with NTS lesions and renal denervation, hemorrhage induced the expression of Fos in hypothalamic magnocellular VP neurons in a pattern similar to that of hemorrhage in intact rats. Collectively, these results indicate that in chronic NTS-lesioned rats an afferent signal arising from the kidneys stimulates VP release during hemorrhage, possibly through renal nerves. However, with the NTS intact or after the selective removal of arterial baroreceptor inputs, such a role for the kidneys is not apparent. Furthermore, in the absence of the NTS and renal nerves, another signal generated by hypotensive hemorrhage continues to stimulate VP neurons.", 
    "323": "1. It has been suggested that local tissue renin-angiotensin systems may be activated in heart failure and that effects on such systems may, at least partially, explain the beneficial effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in this syndrome. To investigate these hypotheses, we examined expression of renin-angiotensin system components in several tissues in a rodent model of post-myocardial infarction (MI) heart failure, and analysed whether such expression is modified by ACE inhibitor treatment. 2. Four groups of rats (n = 8 - 12 per group) were studied 30 days after surgery: (A) sham-operated rats with no treatment, (B) rats with post-MI heart failure induced by ligation of the left coronary artery, (C) sham-operated rats treated with the ACE inhibitor perindopril (1.5 mg day-1 kg-1), and (D) rats as per B, but treated with perindopril. Expression of renin, angiotensinogen, ACE and angiotensin subtype 1 receptor was assessed by quantification of their respective mRNAs by Northern blotting. 3. Renal renin mRNA increased 2-fold in animals with MI (group B) compared with controls (group A) (P < 0.05) and between 50 and 100-fold after ACE inhibitor treatment (P < 0.001). No change in renin gene expression was found in any extra-renal site either following MI or after ACE inhibitor treatment. Hepatic angiotensinogen mRNA level was similar in all groups, but kidney angiotensinogen mRNA level was increased 1.6-fold (P < 0.01) in the groups receiving perindopril. ACE mRNA level in the lung was not affected by ACE inhibitor treatment but decreased by 50% following MI (groups B and D, P < 0.01). This was associated with a similar (50%, P < 0.01) fall in lung ACE activity and was correlated with the severity of heart failure. Angiotensin subtype 1 receptor mRNA level was not affected in any tissue by either MI or ACE inhibitor treatment. 4. We did not find a systematic activation of tissue renin-angiotensin systems, as assessed by steady-state mRNA levels of key components of the system in experimental post-MI heart failure, or a major effect of ACE inhibitor treatment on expression of these components. However, we observed tissue-specific changes in expression of selected components of the renin-angiotensin system in the kidney and the lung in post-MI heart failure and after ACE inhibitor treatment, which may be of relevance to the pathophysiology of the syndrome and the effects of ACE inhibition.", 
    "324": "We previously reported that mRNA levels for extracellular matrix (ECM) components and endothelin (ET)-1 are upregulated in glomeruli of puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) nephrosis. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are effective in experimental models of renal injury, including PAN nephrosis. This study was designed to assess whether the glomerular expression of mRNA for ECM components, ET-1, metalloproteinases (MMP), and a tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP) is modulated by a specific endothelin receptor A antagonist (FR139317) or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril) in PAN-injected rats.",

In group 3, PAN-injected rats were given an intraperitoneal injection of FR139317. Group 4 consisted of saline-injected rats given no treatment. In group 5, saline-injected rats were given enalapril. In group 6, saline-injected rats were given FR139317. We prepared glomerular RNA and performed Northern blot analysis in all groups.", 
    "326": "In PAN nephrosis, glomerular mRNA levels for alpha 1 (IV) collagen chain, laminin B1 and B2 chains, ET-1, MMP-2 and TIMP-1 increased at the peak of proteinuria on day 8 and then decreased to the control level by day 20, whereas those for alpha 1 (I) and alpha 1 (III) collagen chains, MMP-1, MMP-3 and GAPDH showed little change in PAN nephrosis throughout the experimental periods. In contrast, mRNA levels for heparan sulphate proteoglycan (HSPG) decreased on day 8 and then increased to the control level by day 20. Both enalapril and FR139317 attenuated the increases in mRNA levels for alpha 1 (IV) collagen chain (P < 0.01), laminin chains (P < 0.01), and ET-1 (P < 0.01), and attenuated the decreases in mRNA levels for HSPG (P < 0.01) in glomeruli of PAN-injected rats. Enalapril had little effect on increased glomerular mRNA levels for MMP-2 and TIMP-1 in PAN nephrosis, whereas FR139317 attenuated the increases in glomerular mRNA levels for MMP-2 (P < 0.01) and TIMP-1 (P < 0.01).", 
    "327": "These data suggest that the beneficial effects of enalapril and FR139317 may be related to modulation of glomerular mRNA expression of ECM components and ET-1 and that these agents may follow a different mechanism in regulating the glomerular mRNA expression for MMP-2 and TIMP-1 in PAN nephrosis.", 
    "328": "Left ventricular hypertrophy is frequently noted in patients with moderate to severe chronic renal failure not requiring dialysis. Recently, several studies have shown reversal of myocardial hypertrophy in end-stage renal disease with long-term pharmacological control of blood pressure, but it is unclear whether left ventricular mass regresses or normalizes with antihypertensive treatment of patients with earlier stages of chronic renal failure.", 
    "329": "Seventy-two undialysed patients with chronic renal failure, chronic mild-to-moderate hypertension, and left ventricular hypertrophy were randomly assigned in a prospective study to either the captopril (n = 36) or enalapril group (n = 36). Blood pressure measurements, echocardiographic and Doppler parameters were evaluated before treatment and at 6 and 12 months of therapy.", 
    "330": "During follow-up, six patients developed side-effects including dry cough, taste disturbances, skin rash and gastric intolerance. In the captopril group there was a decrease in mean left ventricular mass index by 12% after 6 months of treatment, which decreased by 20% after 12 months treatment. For enalapril, the average reduction of myocardial mass after 6 months treatment was 14% and after 12 months treatment, the decrease was 19%. In both treatment groups there was significant improvement of left ventricular filling dynamics. No deterioration of left ventricular systolic function was observed.", 
    "331": "Our results confirm that antihypertensive monotherapy with the ACE inhibitors, captopril and enalapril, in patients with chronic renal failure results in regression of left ventricular mass index associated with a significant improvement in the diastolic function of the left ventricle without a demonstrable deterioration in left ventricular systolic performance.", 
    "332": "A considerable number of patients with essential hypertension develop cardiac and vascular structural and functional alterations, indicating an adaptation to the persistently elevated blood pressure. Besides the mechanical stress, neuro-humoral stimuli and possibly the genetic disposition contribute to the process of cardiovascular hypertrophy and remodeling. Left ventricular hypertrophy has been identified as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular events and mortality in these patients and therefore regression of cardiac hypertrophy seems to be a meaningful therapeutic goal. A normalization of myocardial hypertrophy can be achieved with various antihypertensive drugs and combinations, where angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors seem to be the most powerful substances. This observation emphasizes the role of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in cardiac diseases. Morphological changes in small resistance arteries do not only represent an adaptation to an elevated peripheral resistance, moreover, they contribute to the persistence of the increase in blood pressure. Investigations on the potential reversibility of small vessel alterations in humans as well as the association with regression of left ventricular hypertrophy will be discussed in this review.",

    "334": "We studied the acute effects of ramipril in 12 healthy control subjects and in 14 patients with essential hypertension. We studied also the effects of 2 months' treatment with ramipril inn 12 patients with essential hypertension and performed a time-control study without amino acids infusion with 12 control subjects. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal plasma flow (RPF), fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) and fractional excretion of lithium (FELi) were determined during 6 clearance periods of 30 min each and amino acids infusion was administered during the last four periods. Plasma concentrations of angiotensin II, aldosterone, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), arginine vasopressin, insulin and glucagon were determined.", 
    "335": "Both the GFR and the RPF increased markedly in healthy subjects after amino acid infusion both with (GFR 7%, RPF 7%) and without ramipril (GFR 7%), RPF 8%), both P < 0.05. Ramipril administered acutely to essential hypertensives prevented the amino acid-induced increase in RPF [with ramipril 5% (NS), without ramipril 9% (P < 0.05)]. The GFR increased equally with (5%) and without (8%) ramipril (P < 0.20). ACE inhibition after 2 months' treatment of essential hypertension blunted the amino acid-induced increase both in GFR and in RPF [with ramipril GFR 5% and RPF 3% (NS), without ramipril GFR 12%, RPF 11% (P < 0.05)]. The FENa did not change in all four experiments. The FELi, insulin and glucagon increased to the same extent in the first three experiments. ANP increased (P < 0.05) in control subjects both with and without ramipril; angiotensin II and aldosterone decreased significantly in control subjects without ramipril.", 
    "336": "The renal haemodynamic response both after acute and after short-term ACE inhibition is attenuated in essential hypertension. Presumably, this treatment makes the arterioles at the glomeruli unresponsive to subsequent amino acid infusion. This inhibition of hyperfiltration might be an important mechanism for the renal protective effect of ACE inhibition in some renal diseases.", 
    "337": "Schedule induced polydipsia, urination and defecation were examined in rats that received training on a fixed interval 2 min schedule of food reinforcement. In Phase I of the experiment, animals received peripheral injections of captopril (an angiotensin conversion enzyme blocker, 0.5 or 50 mg/kg), or equivalent volumes of 0.9% saline. The results showed that low doses of captopril (0.5 mg/kg) significantly increased both operant responding and the adjunctive behaviors. High peripheral doses of captopril significantly reduced responding and schedule induced behavior. In Phase II of the experiment, animals received either low peripheral doses of captopril (sc 0.5 mg/kg), or low doses that were coupled with central injections (i.e., 0.12 mg icv + 0.5 mg/kg sc). As observed in Phase I, low peripheral doses of captopril enhanced behavior, but the enhancement effect was eliminated with low (0.12 mg) central administration. The overall results are consistent with past research examining captopril effects on non-operant, meal-induced drinking. Yet since captopril affected operant responding and adjunctive behaviors similarly, the findings suggest that angiotensin plays a common role in the motivational processes that precede and follow the arrival of food.",

DUE criteria specific to use in the elderly were developed for angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and histamine2 (H2)-antagonists, and consensus was reached by an external expert panel. After pilot testing, two clinical pharmacists independently evaluated these medications, applying the DUE criteria and rating each item as appropriate or inappropriate. Interrater and intrarater reliability was assessed by using kappa statistics.",

The kappa statistic for overall agreement, which considered ratings from all criteria across all domains, was 0.24 for ACE inhibitors and 0.18 for H2-antagonists. Intrarater reliability was assessed 3 months later, and kappa statistics were 0.61-0.65 (0.49 overall) and 0-0.96 (0.81 overall) for ACE inhibitors and H2-antagonists, respectively.",

    "342": "We examined effects of salt and cilazapril on the Ca pump and Na/Ca exchange system in arterial smooth muscle of Dahl salt-sensitive (DS) rats. Twenty-four DS rats were assigned to four groups. H and H+ rats were fed a high salt diet; L- and L+ rats were fed a low salt diet. H+ and L+ were administered cilazapril. Aortic rings were superfused with physiologic saline and isometric tension was measured. Relaxation of low Na+-induced contraction was promoted by the removal of external Ca. Cilazapril significantly decreased blood pressure in both the high and low salt diet groups. The inhibition of renin-angiotensin system by cilazapril showed that Ca extrusion by ATP-driven Ca pump was decreased by salt loading, and that Ca extrusion by Na/Ca exchange was increased by salt loading. There was a negative correlation between Ca extrusion by Ca pump and blood pressure, and a positive correlation between Ca extrusion by Na/Ca exchange and blood pressure. These results suggest that the decrease of Ca2+ extrusion by ATP-driven Ca pump resulting from a high salt diet might lead to an elevation in the concentration of cellular Ca2+ and contribute to the mechanism of hypertension in DS rats, and that Ca2+ extrusion by the Na/Ca exchange might be increased in compensation for an increase in cellular Ca2+ concentration on the high salt diet.", 
    "343": "We investigated whether long-term infusion of kallikrein would attenuate renal injury in salt-induced hypertension in Dahl salt-sensitive (Dahl S) rats. A subdepressor dose of purified rat urinary kallikrein (RUK) (700 ng/day) was infused intravenously by an osmotic minipump for 4 weeks in male Dahl S rats fed a high-salt (2% NaCl) diet. This dose did not affect the time-dependent elevation of blood pressure. However, urinary protein excretion was significantly decreased, and the glomerular filtration rate was increased. These beneficial effects were reflected morphologically by an attenuation of the glomerulosclerotic lesions and tubular injury seen in the hypertensive Dahl S rats. The kallikrein infusion increased the urinary excretion of bradykinin and stimulated the excretion of cyclic GMP, suggesting that the kallikrein-kinin-prostaglandin and nitric oxide axes were enhanced by the RUK infusion. The alterations induced by such infusion were potentiated by the concomitant administration of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor alacepril. These studies indicated that long-term replacement with rat tissue kallikrein attenuates renal injury in hypertensive Dahl S rats, and this is probably mediated by an enhanced function of the kallikrein-kinin-prostaglandin and nitric oxide systems.", 
    "344": "In this cross-over, double-blind study, 12 essential hypertensive patients (stage I, II, and III) with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) between 50 to 80 mL/min/1.73 m2, were submitted to 4 weeks of placebo followed by 12 weeks with isradipine SRO (IS) 5 mg, spirapril (SP) 6 mg, and isradipine plus spirapril (IS + SP). The study evaluated the effects of these drugs on GFR ((99m)Tc DTPA), effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) ((131)I-orthoiodohippurate), urinary sodium excretion (UNaV), urinary kallikrein excretion (UKal), urinary albumin excretion (UAE), and plasma renin activity (PRA). The three protocols significantly reduced mean blood pressure (128 v 107 mm Hg; 126 v 112 mm Hg; 129 v 104 mm Hg with IS, SP and IS + SP, respectively). ERPF and GFR did not change. UNaV increased significantly after IS (0.17 v 0.22 mEq/min) and IS + SP (0.18 v 0.24 mEq/min). UKal increased significantly after IS (58.6%) and IS + SP (53.6%). UAE decreased significantly only after SP. PRA increased significantly after IS (1.31 v 2.84 ng/mL/h), SP (1.10 v 2.15 ng/mL/h), and after IS + SP (1.23 v 3.21 ng/mL/min). In conclusion, IS, SP and IS + SP were effective in reducing blood pressure while keeping renal function stable. Only SP significantly decreased UAE. Enhanced UKal may have played a role in natriuresis observed after IS and IS + SP.", 
    "345": "The Veratran study investigated the antihypertensive efficacy of verapamil sustained release (SR) (180 mg), trandolapril (1 mg), and their fixed combination during a 24-h period. After a 4-week placebo run-in period, 272 patients (age 49 +/- 9 years, mean +/- SD) with essential hypertension and a clinic diastolic blood pressure > or =100 mm Hg were randomized to verapamil, trandolapril, their fixed combination, or placebo for 8 weeks, according to a multicenter double-blind parallel group study design. Clinic and semiautomatic blood pressure at trough and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure were measured at the end of run-in period and after 8 weeks of treatment. In the 234 patients included in the efficacy analysis, run-in clinic and semiautomatic blood pressures were reduced by verapamil, trandolapril, and combined verapamil and trandolapril significantly more than by placebo. The reductions obtained with the combination were significantly greater than those obtained by verapamil alone. Twenty-four-hour average blood pressures were not modified by placebo and were reduced by 8/6 mm Hg (systolic/diastolic) by verapamil, 11/7 mm Hg by trandolapril, and 14/11 mm Hg by the combination of the two drugs. The differences between the effect of the combination and the combination components were, in most instances, statistically significant. The verapamil-trandolapril combination was more effective also on day average blood pressure and superior to the monotherapies for the trough-to-peak ratio of the antihypertensive effect as well. Twenty-four-hour heart rate was slightly but significantly reduced by verapamil and the reduction was manifest in the group taking verapamil plus trandolapril. Thus, the antihypertensive treatment with the fixed verapamil SR-trandolapril combination is more effective and balanced over the 24 hours than the effect of the combination components administered alone.",

    "356": "Heart failure is often complicated by atrial fibrillation. Once atrial fibrillation has started it further enhances heart failure due to uncontrolled rate with shortened filling time and provocation of tachycardiomyopathy. Absent atrial kick and irregularity of the ventricular rhythm also contribute. Considering these mechanisms, restoration of sinus rhythm is most beneficial but is associated with frequent recurrences. Before cardioversion heart failure must be treated. ACE inhibition, initiated before cardioversion, may enhance maintenance of sinus rhythm by reducing neurohumoral activation. As a consequence, arrhythmogenic factors diminish and ventricular function may improve. beta-blockade and amiodarone may have similar effects. If cardioversion fails, adequate rate control is mandatory to prevent progressive ventricular dysfunction. Digitalis is the treatment of first choice, but when the heart rate remains uncontrolled low-dose beta-blockade should be given. If the ventricular rate remains uncontrolled despite drugs, atrioventricular node ablation with implantation of a pacemaker may be considered. Not only patients with idiopathic heart failure and atrial fibrillation, but also those with significant underlying heart disease may benefit from this intervention. In atrial fibrillation patients undergoing cardiac surgery for heart failure due to valvular disease, additional arrhythmia surgery may be contemplated.", 
    "357": "The contents of [Met5]-enkephalin-Arg6-Gly7-Leu8 (met-enk-RGL) and its seven hydrolysis products-Y, YG, YGG, YGGF, YGGFM, YGGFMR, and YGGFMRG-were estimated after incubating met-enk-RGL with a membrane fraction from either guinea pig ileum or striatum for various times at 37 degrees C. After 15 min of incubation, met-enk-RGL was completely hydrolyzed in both the ileal and the striatal membrane preparations. The major hydrolysis products were YGGFMR, YGGF and Y, which indicates that dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase and aminopeptidase activities were mainly involved in the hydrolysis. Additionally, even when the ileal and the striatal preparations were incubated for 60 min in the presence of both captopril, a dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor, and amastatin, an aminopeptidase inhibitor, 24% and 44% of enkephalin octapeptide, respectively, were hydrolyzed. The YGG fragment was the major hydrolysis product in both preparations. When the ileal and the striatal membrane fractions were incubated with met-enk-RGL in the presence of three peptidase inhibitors-captopril, amastatin, and phosphoramidon (an inhibitor of endopeptidase-24.11)-approximately 95% of the enkephalin octapeptide, remained intact in both cases. This shows that met-enk-RGL was almost exclusively hydrolyzed by three enzymes, amastatin-sensitive aminopeptidase, captopril-sensitive dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase I and phosphoramidon-sensitive endopeptidase-24.11, in both ileal and striatal membranes. We also reported the potencies of several opioids relative to that of met-enk-RGL in guinea pig ileum pretreated with the three peptidase inhibitors.",

We report here that losartan markedly inhibits neutrophil shape change, adherence and chemiluminescence responses triggered by N-formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP), without affecting responses induced by immune complexes, zymosan or concanavalin A. Neither saralasin, another antagonist of angiotensin II receptors, nor captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, reproduced the effects of losartan. It was also observed that neutrophil responses triggered by fMLP were not affected by exogenously added angiotensin II. The effect of losartan on the binding of fMLP was measured using [3H]fMLP. It was found that losartan inhibits the binding of [3H]fMLP to neutrophil receptors. As observed for neutrophils, studies performed with monocytes showed that losartan inhibits chemiluminescence emission triggered by fMLP, without affecting chemiluminescence responses triggered by immune complexes, zymosan or concanavalin A.", 
    "359": "The involvement of bradykinin, 5-hydroxytryptamine, substance P and prostanoids in the hyperalgesia elicited by collagenase in rat paw was investigated. Collagenase (100 micrograms) induced a slight hyperalgesia in kininogen deficient rats in comparison with the behavioural response obtained in normal rats. Lisinopril (10(-5) M), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, increased the duration of the hyperalgesia elicited in normal rats. Ondansetron (0.5 to 5 mumol/kg), a 5-HT3 antagonist, suppressed the hyperalgesia as did methysergide (1.1 to 11 mumol/kg), a mixed 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 receptor antagonist. However, the hyperalgesia was not modified by RP 67580 (1.8 to 18 mumol/kg), a NK1 receptor antagonist, and was only slightly delayed by indomethacin (2 mg/kg), a cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor. The oedema-promoting effect of 5-HT (6 nmol) was inhibited by methysergide but not by ondansetron. The swelling induced by collagenase in rat paw was reduced by methysergide but not by ondansetron. We conclude that the behavioural response induced by collagenase depends on an interactions between bradykinin and 5-HT. Prostanoids play a minor role in the beginning of the reaction whereas substance P is not significantly involved in this hyperalgesia.", 
    "360": "Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) have both been implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic renal disease. The present experiment investigated the chronology of TGF-beta 1 gene expression following subtotal nephrectomy (STNx) in the rat and the effect of blocking the RAS by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition or by angiotensin II receptor (AT1) antagonism. Rats that had undergone subtotal nephrectomy developed hypertension, proteinuria, renal impairement, glomerulosclerosis, tubulointerstitial fibrosis and mononuclear cell infiltration. These changes were associated with a 2.5-fold increase in TGF-beta 1 gene expression during a 16-week time course. In situ hybridization localized TGF-beta 1 mRNA to sclerotic glomeruli, areas of tubuloin-terstitial injury and sites of mononuclear cell infiltration. Administration of the ACE inhibitor ramipril and the AT1 receptor blocker valsartan blunted the increase in TGF-beta 1 mRNA, and attenuated the structural and functional manifestations of injury. These data suggest an interaction between the intrarenal RAS and TGF-beta in the pathogenesis of the glomerular and tubulointerstitial fibrosis that follow a major reduction in renal mass.", 
    "361": "Several recent reports have described hypotensive transfusion reactions in patients receiving platelet concentrates (PCs) filtered through white cell-reduction filters. It is well known that a negatively charged surface activates the contact system, consisting of factor XII, prekallikrein, and high-molecular-weight kininogen.", 
    "362": "To clarify the mechanisms of these hypotensive reactions, the possibility that white cell-reduction filtration activates the contact system was examined. Venous blood plasma bradykinin levels were also measured in patients receiving PC transfusions through filters.", 
    "363": "None of the measured values were changed by filtration through a positively charged filter. However, filtration through a negatively charged filter resulted in a decrease in the amounts of prekallikrein and an increase in the amount of bradykinin generated, which indicated the activation of the contact system. The bradykinin level was inversely related to the activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in the PCs and was elevated by addition of an ACE inhibitor. Although the venous blood plasma bradykinin level did not change in two patients with a normal ACE activity during PC transfusion through the negatively charged filter, two patients who had decreased ACE activity, showed a significant increase in bradykinin during the transfusion.", 
    "364": "These results suggest that the generation of a large amount of bradykinin by filtration of PCs through a negatively charged filter might cause hypotensive reactions in patients with decreased ACE activity. The clinical significance of bradykinin generation requires further study.", 
    "365": "Endothelin (ET-1) is a potent vasoconstrictor that plays an important role in the control of renal circulation and tubular function. The contribution of this peptide to the pathogenesis of systemic hypertension and renal failure remains largely undefined. In spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) uninephrectomized at 20 weeks of age (UNX-SHR) and followed until 45 weeks of age, we determined ET-1 gene expression in renal tissue by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and its localization by in situ hybridization in paraffin-embedded kidney sections. Age-matched SHR and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats were chosen as controls. At the end of the follow-up, UNX-SHR had high systolic blood pressure, intense proteinuria, mesangial expansion, focal and segmental glomerular sclerosis, and tubulointerstitial lesions. In relation to WKY and SHR, UNX-SHR exhibited an increase in ET-1 gene expression in renal cortex and medulla. By in situ hybridization and immunoperoxidase staining, an overexpression of ET-1 gene and protein were seen in mesangial and glomerular epithelial cells and in some proximal tubules and vessels. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity was significantly increased in the renal brush border. Since in mesangial cells, angiotensin II induces ET-1 synthesis, a group of UNX-SHR received the ACE inhibitor quinapril from the time of UNX. These animals had a decrease in blood pressure, proteinuria, and serum and brush border ACE activity and in the expression and synthesis of ET-1 in all renal areas. On the whole, these data show that UNX-SHR have an upregulation of ET-1 gene and protein in several structures of the kidney compared with SHR and WKY rats. Quinapril diminished ACE activity and ET-1 expression and synthesis coincidentally with an improvement in proteinuria and morphological lesions. The beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors may be due to the diminution of both angiotensin II and ET-1 generation.", 
    "366": "The purpose of the present study was to test the hypothesis that hypertension induced by reduced renal mass (RRM) upregulates gene expression of the type 1 angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor (AT1) in the thoracic aorta and heart through an Ang II-dependent mechanism. Three groups of rats were given 1% NaCl water and subjected to RRM, RRM plus captopril (RRM+Cap, 30 mg/kg per day), or sham surgery. Tail-cuff systolic blood pressure was significantly elevated in RRM and RRM+Cap rats compared with sham-operated rats. The ratios of the medial wall area of the thoracic aorta and heart weight to body weight were significantly elevated in RRM and RRM+Cap rats compared with sham-operated rats. Northern blot analysis indicated that the ratio of AT1 to GAPDH mRNA in the aorta was significantly higher in RRM (1.85 +/- 0.52) compared with sham-operated (0.21 +/- 0.04) and RRM+Cap (0.55 +/- 0.20) rats. In contrast, the ratio of AT1 to GAPDH mRNA in the heart was significantly increased in both RRM (1.09 +/- 0.23) and RRM+Cap (1.00 +/- 0.09) compared with sham-operated (0.34 +/- 0.06) rats. Thus, RRM hypertension upregulates AT1 mRNA expression in both the hypertrophied aorta and heart. Captopril treatment without altering blood pressure in RRM rats prevents the increase in AT1 mRNA in the aorta but not the heart. These results suggest that different tissue-specific mechanisms of AT1 gene regulation exist; ie, in aorta, an Ang II-or kinin-dependent mechanism is operant, whereas in heart, RRM-induced upregulation of AT1 mRNA may be pressure dependent.", 
    "367": "Renovascular disease is a common cause of secondary hypertension. Renal artery stenosis is present in up to one third of patients with clinical markers suggestive of renovascular hypertension, such as hypertension refractory to medical management, severe hypertension in a young patient and worsening of renal function after the use of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Early discovery of renal artery stenosis may allow amelioration or cure of the hypertension and halt progressive loss of renal function. Although renal arteriography remains the gold-standard aid to diagnosis and to planning surgical intervention, it is an invasive procedure that may cause deterioration of renal function. In the presence of renal artery stenosis, glomerular filtration is maintained by angiotensin. Administration of captopril in renal scintigraphy removes this compensatory mechanism and causes a temporary impairment of renal function in the affected kidney. Nuclear tracers can visualize this impairment, thus allowing assessment of the physiologic significance of a renal artery stenosis. The test can be done as a outpatient procedure.", 
    "368": "1. We investigated the response to pressure (myogenic tone) and flow of rat mesenteric resistance arteries cannulated in an arteriograph which allowed the measurement of intraluminal diameter for controlled pressures and flows. Rats were treated for 3 weeks with NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 50 mg kg-1 day-1) or L-NAME plus the angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) quinapril (10 mg kg-1 day-1). 2. Mean blood pressure increased significantly in chronic L-NAME-treated rats (155 +/- 4 mmHg, n = 8, vs control 121 +/- 6 mmHg, n = 10; P < 0.05). L-NAME-treated rats excreted significantly more dinor-6-keto prostaglandin F1 alpha (dinor-6-keto PGF1 alpha), the stable urinary metabolite of prostacyclin, than control rats. The ACEI prevented the rise in blood pressure and the rise in urinary dinor-6-keto PGF1 alpha due to L-NAME. 3. Isolated mesenteric resistance arteries, developed myogenic tone in response to stepwise increases in pressure (42 +/- 6 to 847 +/- 10 mN mm-1, from 25 to 150 mmHg, n = 9). Myogenic tone was not significantly affected by the chronic treatment with L-NAME or L-NAME + ACEI. 4. Flow (100 microliters min-1) significantly attenuated myogenic tone by 50 +/- 6% at 150 mmHg (n = 10). Flow-induced dilatation was significantly attenuated by chronic L-NAME to 22 +/- 6% at 150 mmHg (n = 10, p = 0.0001) and was not affected in the L-NAME + ACEI group. 5. Acute in vitro NG-nitro-L-arginine (L-NOARG, 10 microM) significantly decreased flow-induced dilation in control but not in L-NAME or L-NAME + ACEI rats. Both acute indomethacin (10 microM) and acute NS 398 (cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor, 1 microM) did not change significantly flow-induced dilatation in controls but they both decreased flow-induced dilatation in the L-NAME and L-NAME + ACEI groups. Acute Hoe 140 (bradykinin receptor inhibitor, 1 microM) induced a significant contraction of the isolated mesenteric arteries which was the same in the 3 groups. 6. Immunofluorescence analysis of COX-2 showed that the enzyme was expressed in resistance mesenteric arteries in L-NAME and L-NAME + ACEI groups but not in control. COX-1 expression was identical in all 3 groups. 7. We conclude that chronic inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis is associated with a decreased flow-induced dilatation in resistance mesenteric arteries which was compensated by an overproduction of vasodilator prostaglandins resulting in part from COX-2 expression. The decrease in flow-induced dilatation was prevented by the ACEI, quinapril.", 
    "369": "Computer-aided conformational analysis was used to characterize the pharmacophore for the intestinal peptide carrier. The active analog approach to pharmacophore building was applied as implemented in the SYBYL software package. Conformational analysis and MOPAC calculations were used to determine the lowest energy conformation of carrier substrates, as well as the conformations of compounds that displayed a common pharmacophoric geometry (i.e., inhibitors and inactive structural analogs). A pharmacophore map was calculated, and based on structural mutualities and functional topology, three substrate groups were suggested: compounds that bind to the transporter and are transferred across the membrane; compounds that show affinity for the peptide carrier (i.e., known to inhibit transport of substrates) but are not transferred across the membrane; and compounds that contain the pharmacophoric geometry but show no affinity for the carrier. Affinity for the peptide transporter can be diminished or abolished in either of three ways: esterification of the free carboxylic acid moiety; introduction of a second negative group; and intramolecular steric hindrance of the free carboxylic acid by either side chains with a positively charged nitrogen function or groups capable of hydrogen bond formation.", 
    "370": "Experimental renal irradiation is followed by a well-defined sequence of events leading to kidney failure. Inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme can prevent the structural and functional changes that occur after renal irradiation, which suggests that the renin-angiotensin system plays a key role in their evolution. We therefore evaluated captopril, used for short intervals, in a total body irradiation model of radiation nephropathy. Irradiated 7- to 8-week-old rats that were treated with captopril from 3.5 to 9.5 weeks after irradiation had better kidney function and survival than irradiated animals treated at earlier or later intervals. At 26 weeks after irradiation, kidney function of these animals was similar to that of irradiated animals treated continuously with captopril, but their subsequent survival was less. Animals irradiated at 7 to 8 weeks of age and treated with captopril from 6 to 9 weeks after irradiation had better function and survival than animals treated at earlier or later intervals. Irradiated 15-week-old animals had significant functional and survival benefit from continuous captopril treatment but no protection from a 6-week interval of therapy. We conclude that radiation nephropathy may be significantly attenuated by the use of captopril from 3.5 to 9.5 weeks after irradiation in young animals. Although older animals did not appear to benefit from a short course of captopril, these data suggest that the renin-angiotensin system is important in the sequential expression of renal radiation injury, particularly between 3.5 and 9.5 weeks after irradiation.", 
    "371": "Anesthesia may induce hemodynamic instability in patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs). To assess the hemodynamic effects of anesthesia in patients treated (n = 9) or not treated (n = 9) with ACEIs for ischemic left ventricle dysfunction after myocardial infarction, we studied 18 patients scheduled for elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Induction of anesthesia with fentanyl (5 micrograms/kg), flunitrazepam (30 micrograms/kg), and pancuronium (100 micrograms/kg) was followed by a significant decrease in mean arterial blood pressure in both groups (-18.6% +/- 8.1% in controls and -25.7% +/- 7.8% in ACEI-treated patients, P = 0.01). In controls, cardiac index and systemic vascular resistance were not significantly altered (-11.2% +/- 9.4% and -16.2% +/- 4.6%, respectively, not significant [NS]). In ACEI-treated patients, cardiac index decreased significantly (-27.3% +/- 11.6%, P = 0.01 from baseline and P = 0.03 when compared with controls), and systemic vascular resistance was unchanged (1.0% +/- 18.7%, NS from baseline and P = 0.04 when compared with controls). Two patients from each group experienced a transient severe hypotensive episode. ACEI treatment in patients with infarction-induced myocardial dysfunction does not increase the incidence of severe hypotension after induction of anesthesia.",

By multivariate Cox regression analysis, adjusting for comorbidity, cause and severity of LVD, heart failure, and concomitant drug use, CCB use was an independent predictor of MI (relative risk [RR] 1.37, confidence interval [CI] 1.14 to 1.63). The increase in MI risk was greater among patients with a higher heart rate (RR 1.46, CI 1.14 to 1.86) and lower blood pressure (RR 1.45, CI 1.14 to 1.86). The adjusted risk ratio for all-cause mortality associated with CCB use was 1.14 (CI 1.00 to 1.28; p = 0.0454). In this analysis of patients with LVD, CCB use was associated with significantly increased risk of fatal or nonfatal MI.",

Systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure were significantly reduced from 163.0 +/- 4.0 to 132.3 +/- 17.6 mmHg (p < 0.01) and from 98.3 +/- 4.6 to 81.5 +/- 6.4 mmHg (p < 0.001), respectively, before to after treatment.

Short-term quinapril administration was beneficial to renal function in patients with essential hypertension and impaired renal function.", 
    "374": "The role of the HPA axis in blood pressure regulation was examined in 6 normal male volunteers by comparing haemodynamic and hormonal effects of placebo, captopril, and dexamethasone given in random order for two days. The average 24-hour systolic and mean arterial pressures on placebo (135 +/- 6 and 93 +/- 2 mmHg respectively) were significantly higher than on captopril (118 +/- 1 and 85 +/- 1 mmHg respectively, p < 0.05) but there were no significant changes on dexamethasone compared with placebo (128 +/- 3 and 89 +/- 3 mmHg respectively). There were no differences in the average 24-hour diastolic blood pressures or heart rates, nor the day-night differences, night:day ratios or percentage changes in blood pressure and heart rate between treatments. Captopril significantly increased active plasma renin concentration, whilst dexamethasone decreased cortisol concentration. These results confirm the role of the renin-angiotensin system in the regulation of blood pressure in normal subjects but suggest that the HPA axis does not play a major role in determining ambulatory blood pressure or day-night variability in the short term.",

Eight hypertensive cats with ALDO concentration > 2 SD above the mean concentration in control cats had low (n = 3), normal (n = 4), or high (n = 1) PRA, suggesting variable activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis in the hypertensive state.

    "385": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship between early hemodynamic instability and myocardial ischemia and the effect of early intravenous enalapril therapy on this relationship. In patients with myocardial infarction (MI), early treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors is controversial. In hypotensive patients, initiation of treatment may exacerbate myocardial ischemia and thereby affect the clinical outcome. Therefore, in the CONSENSUS II study, a total of 60 patients randomly allocated to either intravenous enalapril or placebo treatment commenced within 24 h after the onset of MI were evaluated by repeated blood pressure measurements, ambulatory ST-segment monitoring before discharge and exercise testing. Significant ST-depression was present in 34 patients. Patients with ST-depression before discharge (residual ischemia) during either exercise testing or ambulatory monitoring or both had a decrease in initial mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) of 20 vs. 9 mm Hg in those without ST-depression (n = 24), (p < 0.00001). However, patients (n = 13) with long-lasting ST-depression during Holter monitoring, (> 60 min of ST-depression) presented with the most severe fall in MAP of 29 mm Hg (p < 0.00001) and a lower systolic blood pressure at inclusion (p < 0.01) compared to the remainder of patients. Furthermore, the number of recurrent acute ischemic events during follow-up was higher in these patients (7 vs. 1; p < 0.01). Ten of the patients treated with enalapril showed a long-lasting ST-depression versus only 3 in the placebo group (p = 0.08), and the average duration of all significant ST-depressions during Holter monitoring was significantly longer in the enalapril group compared to the placebo group (p < 0.05). Finally, 7 enalapril patients (20%) suffered an acute ischemic event in contrast to 1 patient (4%) in the placebo group (p = 0.07). In conclusion, early administration of enalapril had a potential proischemic effect in hypotension-prone patients mediated through exacerbation of the hemodynamic response, inasmuch as initial blood pressure fall after MI is related to residual myocardial ischemia and recurrent acute ischemic syndromes.", 
    "386": "The exercise intolerance and excessive ventilatory response to exercise of chronic heart failure is associated with abnormalities of skeletal muscle function, in particular a reduction in muscle strength. Isometric and isokinetic leg muscle strength were measured in 10 patients with chronic heart failure and 10 age-matched controls. Each subject undertook maximal exercise testing to measure peak oxygen consumption (V(O2)) and the ventilatory response to exercise as measured by the slope of the relation between ventilation and carbon dioxide production (V(E)/V(CO2) slope). Quadriceps strength (mean (S.D.)) was reduced in heart failure as measured by isometric (444.9 (129.6) N vs. 556.0 (136.0); P<0.01) and isokinetic (123.6 (30.2) Nm vs. 146.8 (40.0); P=0.04). Hamstring strength was also reduced as measured by isokinetic testing (53.6 (15.6) Nm vs. 71.1 (28.1); P=0.02). Isokinetic and isometric strengths correlated, but not closely (r=0.52, P<0.001). There were negative correlations between the V(E)/V(CO2) slope, and isokinetic measures: with average torque, r=-0.62, P<0.004; with peak torque, r=-0.64, P=0.002. We have found evidence for reduced muscle function affecting both knee flexors and extensors. This reduction in muscle strength correlates with the ventilatory response to exercise. These observations lend support to the muscle hypothesis of the generation of symptoms in chronic heart failure.", 
    "387": "Vascular smooth muscle cells from hypertensive transgenic rats for the mouse Ren-2 gene exhibited radioimmunoassayable angiotensin II and hyperplasia in comparison with cells from Sprague-Dawley rats. However, neither captopril, losartan, saralasin, nor PD123319 (all at 10 microM) modified DNA synthesis or cell number observed in 4-day growth curves with 10% fetal calf serum. Nifedipine reduced DNA synthesis in both cell types, the concentration required being significantly higher in Sprague-Dawley- (1 microM) than in transgenic-derived cultures (100 nM). The EC50 values were of 2.43 +/- 0.32 and 1.0 +/- 0.17 microM, respectively (P < 0.05). In both cell types, only 10 microM nifedipine reduced serum-induced cell proliferation, but inhibition percentage was higher in transgenic-derived cultures. In conclusion, hyperplasia of transgenic-derived vascular smooth muscle cells is not blocked by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor antagonists, but these cells are more sensitive to the antiproliferative effects of nifedipine.",

Patients achieving the goal diastolic blood pressure of <90 mm Hg during drug titration entered a 1-year maintenance period. Longitudinal analysis examined changes from baseline echocardiogram in LV mass at 8 weeks and at 1 year, statistically adjusted for pretreatment LV mass, systolic blood pressure, body weight, sodium excretion, physical activity, race, and age.

In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study of 39 physically active men with uncomplicated essential hypertension, we compared the effects of atenolol and enalapril on cardiovascular fitness and serum lipids. Drugs (atenolol, 50 or 100 mg once daily; enalapril, 10 or 20 mg once daily) were each administered for 4 weeks and each active drug period was preceded by 4 weeks of placebo therapy. Both drugs effectively (p < 0.001) lowered resting blood pressure when measured at the time of theoretical peak (i.e., 3 to 4 hours postdrug) and trough (i.e., 24 hours postdrug) drug blood levels. Atenolol reduced maximal oxygen uptake (by 7.3%, p < 0.001) 3 to 4, but not 24, hours after drug ingestion; no changes occurred with enalapril. Similarly, whereas serum lipids were essentially unchanged with enalapril, serum triglycerides (18.9% increase), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (10.6% decrease), and ratio of low-density to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (15.4% increase) were adversely impacted (p < or = 0.05) with atenolol.

A marked decrease and increase in systolic BP from rest to peak were defined as changes of > or = 20 mm Hg, and > or = 30 mm Hg, respectively. Worst outcome events were cardiac death (n = 30), nonfatal myocardial infarction (n = 17), and hospitalization for congestive heart failure (n = 8). A decrease in systolic BP (prevalence 16%) was associated with older age and higher baseline systolic BP. Fixed and reversible sestamibi perfusion defects and follow-up results were similar to patients without a systolic BP decrease. In contrast, an increase in systolic BP (prevalence 24%) was associated with younger age, lower baseline systolic BP, and with absence of a history of prior congestive heart failure or treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Furthermore, these patients had fewer fixed perfusion defects and tended to have fewer annual event rates (3.5% vs 7.5%, p < 0.10). In a multivariate model, an increase in systolic BP was not an independent predictor for subsequent events. In conclusion, a dobutamine-induced decrease in systolic BP is not associated with fixed or reversible sestamibi defects or adverse prognosis. An increase in systolic BP, however, is associated with less fixed sestamibi defects and a tendency toward less annual event rates.", 
    "394": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) improve cardiac function and remodeling and prolong survival in patients with heart failure (HF). Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) with an angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist (AT1-ant) may have a similar beneficial effect. In addition to inhibition of the RAS, ACEi may also act by inhibiting kinin destruction, whereas AT1-ant may block the RAS at the level of the AT1 receptor and activate the angiotensin II type 2 (AT2) receptor. Using a model of HF induced by myocardial infarction (MI) in rats, we studied the role of kinins in the cardioprotective effect of ACEi. We also investigated whether an AT1-ant has a similar effect and whether these effects are partly due to activation of the AT2 receptor. Two months after MI, rats were treated for 2 mo with: (a) vehicle; (b) the ACEi ramipril, with and without the B2 receptor antagonist icatibant (B2-ant); or (c) an AT1-ant with and without an AT2-antagonist (AT2-ant) or B2-ant. Vehicle-treated rats had a significant increase in left ventricular end-diastolic (LVEDV) and end-systolic volume (LVESV) as well as interstitial collagen deposition and cardiomyocyte size, whereas ejection fraction was decreased. Left ventricular remodeling and cardiac function were improved by the ACEi and AT1-ant. The B2-ant blocked most of the cardioprotective effect of the ACEi, whereas the effect of the AT1-ant was blocked by the AT2-ant. The decreases in LVEDV and LVESV caused by the AT1-ant were also partially blocked by the B2-ant. We concluded that (a) in HF both ACEi and AT1-ant have a cardioprotective effect, which could be due to either a direct action on the heart or secondary to altered hemodynamics, or both; and (b) the effect of the ACEi is mediated in part by kinins, whereas that of the AT1-ant is triggered by activation of the AT2 receptor and is also mediated in part by kinins. We speculate that in HF, blockade of AT1 receptors increases both renin and angiotensins; these angiotensins stimulate the AT2 receptor, which in turn may play an important role in the therapeutic effect of the AT1-ant via kinins and other autacoids.", 
    "395": "Atherosclerosis and its consequences account for most of the morbidity and mortality in Western countries. It is a disease of the intima and primarily involves four cell types, i.e., endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells, monocytes and platelets. In recent years, knowledge on the cellular and molecular mechanisms of these cells and their alterations by cardiovascular risk factors and in atherosclerosis has greatly expanded. In particular, it has become clear that endothelial cells play a crucial role in the regulation of platelet function, coagulation, and vascular tone and structure. Interestingly, endothelial dysfunction occurs early, particularly if cardiovascular risk factors such as hyperlipidemia, hypertension and diabetes are present. This could lead to adhesion of circulating platelets and monocytes and increased accumulation of lipids in the intima, as well as increased contraction, migration and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells. One of the enzymes with a key role in vascular homeostasis is angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE). ACE is located on the endothelial cell membrane and is responsible for the conversion of angiotensin I into angiotensin II, as well as for the breakdown of bradykinin. While the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors probably contributes to their antiatherogenic effects, other mechanisms are likely to be of greater importance. These direct antiatherogenic effects attributable to ACE inhibition are related to their vasculoprotective properties, including antiproliferative and antimitogenic activity, effects on endothelial function, protection against plaque rupture, antithrombotic effects, and possible antioxidant properties. There is overwhelming evidence to demonstrate the beneficial effects of long-term ACE inhibitor treatment in heart failure, acutely for suspected myocardial infarction (MI), and following MI in patients with left ventricular dysfunction. Hypercholesterolemia is a health risk, and epidemiological studies have shown a line between total cholesterol levels and the risk of cardiac events. Studies have shown that lowering the levels of total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol using HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors can result in a decrease in cardiac morbidity and mortality. Angiographic studies of coronary arteries have demonstrated a disparity between the decrease in cardiac events and the extent of regression of coronary artery lesions. Mechanisms other than the regression of coronary stenosis may therefore be important in the beneficial effect of cholesterol lowering. It may be of major importance that lipid-lowering therapy is associated with improved endothelial function and decreased platelet activity. Thus, both ACE inhibitors and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have vasculoprotective properties which may explain their beneficial effects on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.", 
    "396": "Atherosclerotic renovascular disease is a common entity, particularly in persons older than 50 years of age and especially in those patients with other evidence of atherosclerotic vascular disease. The illness clearly progresses in some patients, and progression rate appears to be highly variable. Taken into account the apparent high prevalence of renovascular disease in older persons, it is possible that this disorder be the cause of end stage renal disease in 5% to 15% of patients currently entering the dialysis program each year. Surgery and percutaneous angioplasty can both improve renal function in patients with renal artery stenosis. We describe a patient in whom the detection of renovascular disease was made accidentally at the time of coronary arteriography. He presented an acute renal failure after use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and/or contrast media associated nephrotoxicity, and was treated with percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty and had a successful outcome.", 
    "397": "Bradykinins have only recently been identified in fish, and a detailed analysis of their cardiovascular actions is lacking. The present study examines the cardiovascular effects of trout bradykinin ([Arg0,Trp5,Leu8]bradykinin; tBK) in conscious trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss. tBK (1-10 nmol/kg body wt bolus) produced triphasic pressor-depressor-pressor responses. In phase 1, cardiac output (CO), ventral aortic (P(VA)), dorsal aortic (P(DA)), and central venous pressure increased, whereas systemic (R(S)) and gill resistance (R(G)) were unchanged. In phase 2, R(G) increased, whereas R(S), CO, and heart rate decreased, reducing P(VA) and P(DA). Plasma prostaglandin E2 and the prostacyclin metabolite, 6-ketoprostaglandin F1alpha, were significantly elevated during phase 2, whereas leukotrienes C4 and B4 and thromboxane B2 were unaffected. Phase 3 was produced by an increased CO and R(S) and the return of R(G) to control. Phase 1 pressor response was not blocked by inhibitors of cyclooxygenase, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) or alpha-adrenoceptors (alpha-AD), whereas phase 2 depressor and plasma prostaglandin responses were prevented by cyclooxygenase inhibition. Phase 3 was partially blocked by ACE and alpha-AD inhibitors and is a response to the preceding hypotension. In vitro, tBK only decreased vascular resistance in the perfused splanchnic or skeletal muscle-kidney preparations. These results show that although tBK has multiple effects on the trout cardiovascular system, none of the effects are due to direct tBK stimulation of vascular smooth muscle. Phase 2 vasodilation has features consistent with release of vasodilator prostaglandins while the mechanism of phase 1 constriction is unknown.", 
    "398": "Several trials have demonstrated functional benefit with beta-blockers in patients with chronic heart failure. The aim of this observational study was to investigate if additional beneficial effects can be obtained from beta-blockade in a heart failure population that is already receiving high-dose ACE-inhibitor therapy. Atenolol is a long-acting cardioselective beta-blocking agent and is devoid of additional vasodilatory properties. Twenty-five male patients with class II or III heart failure and background therapy of digitalis, furosemide and 20 mg fosinopril per day were treated with 40 mg fosinopril per day and additional 75 mg atenolol per day (beta-blocker group) or with 40 mg fosinopril per day alone (control group). At the end of one year, changes in left ventricular function, exercise parameters and plasma neurohumoral variables reflecting vasoconstriction (noradrenaline, big endothelin) were measured and compared in the two treatment groups. Nineteen patients completed the study. Drop-outs were due to death (4 patients) and non-compliance (2 patients) with no significant difference between the groups. There was a beta-blocker related improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction (p < 0.05 between groups) and an increase in peak oxygen consumption in the control group only (p < 0.05 between groups). Thus, in a heart failure population receiving high-dose ACE inhibitor background therapy beta-blockade with atenolol produced additional benefit by reversing left ventricular dysfunction.", 
    "399": "The efficiency of the drug discovery process can be significantly improved using design techniques to maximize the diversity of structure databases or combinatorial libraries. Here, several physicochemical descriptors were investigated to quantify molecular diversity. Based on the 2D or 3D topological similarity of molecules, the relationship between physicochemical metrics and biological activity was studied to find valid descriptors. Several compounds were selected using those descriptors from a database containing diverse templates and 55 biological classes. It was evaluated whether the obtained subsets represent all biological properties and structural variations of the original database. In addition, hierarchical cluster analyses were used to group molecules from the parent database, which should have similar biological properties. Using various sets of structurally similar molecules, it was possible to derive quantitative measures for compound similarities in relation to biological properties. A similarity radius for 2D fingerprints and molecular steric fields was estimated; compounds within this radius of another molecule were shown to have comparable biological properties. This study demonstrates that 2D fingerprints alone or in combination with other metrics as the primary descriptor allow to handle global diversity. In addition, standard atom-pair descriptors or molecular steric fields can be used to correlate structural diversity with biological activity. Hence, the latter two descriptors can be classified as secondary descriptors useful for analog library design, while 2D fingerprints are applicable to design a general library for lead discovery. Based on these findings, an optimally diverse subset containing only 38% of the entire IC93 database was generated using 2D fingerprints. Here no structure is more similar than 0.85 to any other (Tanimoto coefficient), but all biological classes were selected. This reduction of redundancy led to a child database with the same physicochemical diversity space, which contains the same information as the original database.", 
    "400": "Several studies have demonstrated substantial risk reduction by risk factor modification in patients with established coronary artery disease. The number of studies investigating the implementation of risk factor intervention in clinical practice, however, is limited. We have, therefore, recorded drug use and cardiovascular risk factors in all 148 patients who had undergone percutaneous coronary angioplasty (PTCA) in 1989 at the University Hospital, Zurich, on hospital admission, after 6 months and 5 years later. Most patients had antithrombotic treatment with little change over time (78%, 87% and 83% on admission, after 6 months and after 5 years respectively, p = 0.27). The use of beta-blockers decreased moderately after 5 years (73%, 81% and 61% respectively, p < 0.01). Calcium channel blockers were used frequently without significant change in the follow-up period (56%, 50% and 46%, p = 0.25). Five years after PTCA, 91% of patients with a history of hypertension were on antihypertensive drugs. The use of lipid-lowering drugs increased markedly (5%, 16% and 33% respectively, p < 0.01). However, only a small proportion of patients qualifying for lipid-lowering drugs according to Swiss guidelines were treated. The proportion of current smokers decreased from 26% on hospital admission in 1989 to 12% in 1994. We conclude that in our study population secondary prevention was generally satisfactorily implemented. However, better monitoring and treatment of increased lipid levels is mandatory.", 
    "401": "Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) is a type I transmembrane protein composed of two domains (N and C domains) which undergoes a post-translational proteolytic cleavage in mammalian cells to release the soluble ectodomain. The protease involved in ACE cleavage-secretion (ACE-secretase) is not well characterised and eludes isolation: the presence of a yeast homologue, thus more amenable to genetic manipulation, would facilitate its identification. We have expressed a secreted form of the ACE C domain, lacking the C-terminal membrane anchor (C domain(deltaCOOH)), and the membrane-anchored C domain (C domain) in the yeast Pichia pastoris by fusion to prepro-alpha-factor. Immunofluorescent labelling localises the ACE C domain to the periphery of yeast cells but not C domain(deltaCOOH), however, expression of both C domain and C domain(deltaCOOH) produced soluble enzymes in the culture medium. Immunocharacterisation of the two soluble forms of the C domain indicates a proteolytic cleavage of the membrane-bound C domain to produce the soluble counterpart. Thus ACE undergoes a proteolytic cleavage in yeast.", 
    "402": "We estimated effective atomic contact energies (ACE), the desolvation free energies required to transfer atoms from water to a protein's interior, using an adaptation of a method introduced by S. Miyazawa and R. L. Jernigan. The energies were obtained for 18 different atom types, which were resolved on the basis of the way their properties cluster in the 20 common amino acids. In addition to providing information on atoms at the highest resolution compatible with the amount and quality of data currently available, the method itself has several new features, including its reference state, the random crystal structure, which removes compositional bias, and a scaling factor that makes contact energies quantitatively comparable with experimentally measured energies. The high level of resolution, the explicit accounting of the local properties of protein interiors during determination of the energies, and the very high computational efficiency with which they can be assigned during any computation, should make the results presented here widely applicable. First we used ACE to calculate the free energies of transferring side-chains from protein interior into water. A comparison of the results thus obtained with the measured free energies of transferring side-chains from n-octanol to water, indicates that the magnitude of protein to water transfer free energies for hydrophobic side-chains is larger than that of n-octanol to water transfer free energies. The difference is consistent with observations made by D. Shortle and co-workers, who measured differential free energies of protein unfolding for site-specific mutants in which Ala or Gly was substituted for various hydrophobic side-chains. A direct comparison (calculated versus observed free energy differences) with those experiments finds slopes of 1.15 and 1.13 for Gly and Ala substitutions, respectively. Finally we compared calculated and observed binding free energies of nine protease-inhibitor complexes. This requires a full free energy function, which is created by adding direct electrostatic interactions and an appropriate entropic component to the solvation free energy term. The calculated free energies are typically within 10% of the observed values. Taken collectively, these results suggest that ACE should provide a reasonably accurate and rapidly evaluatable solvation component of free energy, and should thus make accessible a range of docking, design and protein folding calculations that would otherwise be difficult to perform.", 
    "403": "Mortality of patients with severe congestive heart failure (CHF) is still high despite combined treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, diuretics, and digitalis. Further therapeutic regimens are needed which include reversal of adverse myocardial remodeling and subsequent ventricular dysfunction. One third of all patients with CHF have diastolic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction with preserved systolic function. In these patients myocardial collagen matrix is the major determinant of myocardial stiffness and therefore diastolic function. Cardiac fibroblasts, expressing mRNA for types I and III collagens which are the major fibrillar proteins of the myocardial collagen network and for matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 1 which is the key enzyme for interstitial collagen degradation, are controlled by the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAAS) system irrespective of hemodynamics and cardiac myocyte growth. In the rat with primary or secondary hyperaldosteronism, myocardial fibrosis occurs in the pressure overloaded, hypertrophied left and in the normotensive, nonhypertrophic right ventricle. In contrast, no fibrosis is found in either ventricle of rats with infrarenal aortic banding, when the RAAS is not activated, despite comparable systemic hypertension and LV hypertrophy. In cultured cardiac fibroblasts, either effector hormone of the RAAS, angiotensin (Ang) II and aldosterone (Aldo) stimulate collagen synthesis measured by 3H-proline incorporation under serum-free conditions. Aldo is able to stimulate collagen synthesis normalized per total protein synthesis in a dose-dependent manner and at concentrations (10(-9) M) which are comparable to stimulated states in vivo (e.g., CHF). While Aldo does not affect collagen degradation AngII significantly inhibits, MMP 1 activity that would lead to further accumulation of collagen in the myocardium. Specific AngII type I or Aldo receptor antagonists are able to abolish the AngII or Aldo-mediated increase in collagen synthesis, respectively. In vivo in rats with primary or secondary hyperaldosteronism, the Aldo antagonist spironolactone has been shown to prevent myocardial fibrosis in both ventricles irrespective of the development of LV hypertrophy and hypertension. Thus, in vivo and in vitro evidence could be provided that the mineralocorticoid. Aldo, plays a pivotal role in promoting myocardial fibrosis and can be antagonized by its competitive receptor blocker, spironolactone. This may be of particular clinical relevance in treating patients with CHF where the RAAS is activated leading to myocardial fibrosis with subsequent deterioration of myocardial function. Clinical trials are needed to confirm these experimental data. If the ongoing RALES mortality study will prove that survival and/or morbidity of patients with CHF are improved by combined ACE inhibitor/spironolactone treatment a renaissance of anti-aldosterone therapy in patients with CHF would occur.", 
    "404": "The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy and tolerability of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor moexipril alone and in combination with hydrochlorothiazide versus hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy in patients with stage II and III essential hypertension. This was a double-blind, randomized, multicenter trial that evaluated moexipril (15 and 30 mg once daily), hydrochlorothiazide (25 and 50 mg once daily), and combinations of the drugs (15 mg moexipril/25 mg hydrochlorothiazide and 30 mg moexipril/50 mg hydrochlorothiazide) in 272 hypertensive patients whose seated diastolic blood pressure (BP) was 100 to 114 mm Hg. The primary efficacy variable was the mean change from baseline in seated diastolic BP at the end of the dosing period. Secondary efficacy measures included changes in systolic BP and standing BP. The lower doses of moexipril and hydrochlorothiazide reduced diastolic BP similarly (-8.0 +/- 1.4 versus -8.1 +/- 1.4 mm Hg; p = NS) as did higher doses of the monotherapeutic regimens (moexipril, -9.7 +/- 1.2 mm Hg versus hydrochlorothiazide, -11.0 +/- 1.2 mm Hg, p = NS). Combinations of moexipril and hydrochlorothiazide reduced diastolic BP significantly more than either monotherapy (lower doses, -16.0 +/- 1.4 mm Hg; p < 0.001; higher doses, -17.9 +/- 1.2 mm Hg; p < 0.001). Similar trends were observed for the systolic BP. Discontinuation rates due to adverse events were 0% for the moexipril monotherapy patients and 3% to 5% in patients on diuretic or combination treatment. These data demonstrate that 15 and 30 mg moexipril once daily lower BP similarly to hydrochlorothiazide in patients with stage II and III hypertension. There is also an additive effect when combining the two agents that lowers BP more significantly than either monotherapy.",

The expressions of AT1A were examined both at the mRNA level by in situ hybridization using a subtype-specific probe and at the protein level by an immunohistochemistry methods using AT1 receptor antibody in normal rat kidneys and the obstructed rat kidneys.",

    "408": "The increased expressions of AT1A were found in the acute renal tubulointerstitial pathogenesis induced by UUO. Benazepril may retard the progression of TIF and decrease the expression of AT1A in the obstructed kidneys.

    "409": "Role of renin-angiotensin system in hypertension induced by cadmium chloride (CdCl2) in rats has been investigated. Intravenous administration of CdCl (1 mg/kg) produced a biphasic response i.e. a transient fall followed by a marked and consistent rise in blood pressure. The peak hypertensive effect was accompanied by raised PRA levels. Pretreatment with captopril (1 mg/kg, i.v.) losartan (1 mg/kg, i.v.) or captopril + losartan attenuated the pressor response to Cd by 62%, 42% and 100% respectively in separate groups. Central administration of Cd (10 micrograms/rat, i.c.v.) showed a biphasic response similar to that observed after i.v. route. However, it was not accompanied by raised PRA levels. Prior treatment with losartan (10 micrograms/rat, i.c.v.) completely abolished the pressor response to Cd (i.c.v.) whereas it was not affected significantly by captopril (10 micrograms/rat, i.c.v.). On the other hand, centrally administered losartan only partially reduced the pressor response to i.v. Cd. The results are discussed in light of a differential involvement of central vs peripheral renin-angiotensin system in the hypertensive effect of Cd.", 
    "410": "Using indomethacin (2.5 mg/kg/day, i.m.) in rats, we confirmed the well-known interaction of NSAID's and the urinary elimination of lithium. This is due to an increase in the tubular reabsorption of lithium, probably associated with an increase in the reabsorption of sodium in the ascending limb of the loop of Henle, following inhibition of the synthesis of prostaglandins. With ramipril (1 mg/kg/day, p.o.), we confirmed an interaction with lithium pharmacokinetics in rats, also associated with an increase in the tubular reabsorption of sodium. In contrast, the angiotensin receptor antagonist losartan (10 mg/kg/day, p.o.) had no effect in this paradigm. Since the effects of ramipril were partially inhibited by an i.v. infusion of an antagonist of the bradykinin B2 receptor icatibant (0.1 mg/kg/day), we suggest that bradykinin contributes to the interaction between angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and renal excretion of lithium.", 
    "411": "Antihypertensive drugs slow the progressive decline in renal function seen in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes and nephropathy. In a recent study, the ACE inhibitor captopril protected against this deterioration in renal function. We developed an economic model to analyse the cost impact of ACE inhibitor treatment on progression to endstage renal failure (ESRF) in diabetic patients over 4 years. Two scenarios were compared: one describing the progression of a cohort of 1000 patients receiving 25 mg captopril three times daily, and the other for an equivalent cohort without such prophylactic treatment. Previously published data were used to estimate the transition rates for each stage from the onset of renal failure until death. All direct costs were discounted by an annual rate of 6%, and were subjected to sensitivity analysis. The discounted cost saving of ACE inhibitor treatment for a cohort of 1000 patients was estimated as 0.95 million pounds over 4 years. Under sensitivity analysis, these results were very robust to variations in the costs of ESRF treatment. Prophylactic treatment with ACE inhibitors was predicted to provide substantial increases in life expectancy and reduction in the incidence of ESRF, while also providing significant economic savings.", 
    "412": "We investigated the effects of losartan, an AT1-receptor blocker, and ramipril, a converting enzyme inhibitor, on the pressor response induced by angiotensin II (ANG II) and carbachol (a cholinergic receptor agonist). Male Holtzman rats (250-300 g) with a stainless steel cannula implanted into the lateral ventricle (LV) were used. The injection of losartan (50 nmol/1 microliter) into the LV blocked the pressor response induced by ANG II (12 ng/1 microliter) and carbachol (2 nmol/1 microliter). After injection of ANG II and carbachol into the LV, mean arterial pressure (MAP) increased to 31 +/- 1 and 28 +/- 2 mmHg, respectively. Previous injection of losartan abolished the increase in MAP induced by ANG II and carbachol into the LV (2 +/- 1 and 5 +/- 2 mmHg, respectively). The injection of ramipril (12 ng/1 microliter) prior to carbachol blocked the pressor effect of carbachol to 7 +/- 3 mmHg. These results suggest an interaction between central cholinergic pathways and the angiotensinergic system in the regulation of arterial blood pressure.", 
    "413": "The prognostic value of thrombolytics, aspirin, beta-blockers and ACE-inhibitors has been well documented in large clinical trials, but the application of these drugs in clinical practice is not known. MITRA is a multicenter study of 54 hospitals in a defined region in southwest Germany. The aim is to document actual clinical practice (pilot phase) and to establish an individually optimised prognostic therapy for acute myocardial infarction, considering only the absolute contraindications for each drug. In the pilot phase, 1303 consecutive patients with acute transmural myocardial infarction were enrolled. The median age was 66 years, the prehospital time was 2.7 hours. 47% had an anterior infarction. In the subgroup of patients without absolute contraindications, only 53.4% were treated with thrombolytics, 87.6% with aspirin, 37.1% with beta-blocker, and 17.4% with ACE-inhibitor. Out of these, patients were classified as \"optimally treated\" if they received thrombolysis, aspirin as well as beta-blocker. Patients were also included if any of these medications was withheld in the presence of absolute contraindications. Treatment was defined suboptimal, if the patients did not receive any of these three medications despite the absence of absolute contraindications. Only 29% (n = 383) received an optimal post-infarction therapy and 71% (n = 775) a suboptimal treatment. The univariate analysis revealed 10 variables influencing optimal therapy. In this subgroup patients were younger, they more often had clear ECG-findings or left bundle branch block, an anterior infarction, acute cardiac failure, AV-block, bradycardia, recent trauma or surgery (less then 2 weeks) and a severe chronic obstructive lung disease. The prehospital time was more often available. Early mortality after 2 days was 5.0% versus 9.3% in the suboptimal treated patients (OR: 0.5, CI: 0.30-0.86) the total inhospital mortality was 10.9% in the optimal versus 17.7% in the suboptimal group (OR: 0.6, CI: 0.38-0.84). In a multivariate analysis the parameter \"optimal treatment\" was found to be an independent predictor of the early (OR = 0.4; CI: 0.20-0.69) and the inhospital mortality (OR = 0.4; CI: 0.25-0.64). The following in-hospital events occurred: stroke 2.8%, reinfarction 12.9%, cardiac failure 21.5%, cardiogenic shock 10.4% and in-hospital mortality 18.1% (2-days mortality 9.5%). Pharmacological therapy for acute myocardial infarction is inconsistent with the recommendations suggested in recent clinical trials and needs to be individually optimised. Optimal treatment is an independent predictor of early and inhospital mortality.", 
    "414": "As a net effect of ACE-inhibitors and AT1-receptor antagonists on the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) cardioprotection due to vasodilative (reduction of blood pressure, afterload reduction), antiproliferative (reduced cell growth, reduction of \"vascular\" and/or \"ventricular remodeling\", reduced formation of extracellular matrix), as well as antiadrenergic actions and due to the stimulating effect on natriuresis, reduction of blood pressure, preload reduction can be expected. These aims of therapy have mostly been confirmed for the action of ACE-inhibitors by experimental and clinical studies but except for the treatment of arterial hypertension and few preliminary reports concerning the treatment of cardiac dysfunction, no comparable data are available for AT1-receptor antagonists. To date, an antithrombotic and profibrinolytic action could only be demonstrated for ACE-inhibitors. This effect has been discussed to be responsible for the improvement of long-term prognosis in patients with coronary artery disease. Despite the similar spectrum of action there exist important differences between ACE-inhibitors and AT1-receptor antagonists that might underline the need of an individual use of these drugs: the dual action of ACE-inhibitors on the RAS and the kinin system bears many benefits but has been also shown to be accompanied by side-effects, mainly chronic dry cough, in a relatively high percentage of patients thus leading to discontinuation of therapy in 8-14%. This respective side-effect can be prevented by the use of AT1-receptor antagonists. It has been discussed whether the incomplete action of ACE-inhibitors on AT1-receptor-mediated effects is at least in part responsible for the efficacy of this drug which is relatively high (75-80%) as compared to other substances. Due to their direct action, AT1-receptor-blockers might also be of high effectiveness for the treatment of severe heart failure. A combination of the ACE-inhibitor-mediated activation of the kinin-system with the more specific blockade of AT1-receptors by AT1-receptor antagonists might be of benefit and is currently under investigation. Finally, it has been discussed that the increased AT II concentration in case of AT1-receptor-blockade activates AT2-receptor-mediated mechanisms thus leading to an additive vasoprotective effect.", 
    "415": "In balloon-injured rat carotid arteries, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) decrease neointima formation, and a kinin receptor antagonist partially reverses this inhibitory effect. We studied which of the events leading to neointima formation are involved in the effects of ACEI and kinins.", 
    "416": "We administered 5 mg/kg per day ramipril, either alone or combined with the kinin receptor antagonist icatibant (Hoe 140), on the days each wave occurred and studied the effects on neointima formation 14 days after balloon injury. Ramipril alone or combined with icatibant had no effect on neointima formation when administered from 2 days before to 3 or 5 days after balloon injury. In contrast, ramipril inhibited neointima formation when administered from day 7 to day 14. Treatment with icatibant had a small effect, which was sufficient to abolish the effects of ramipril (control 0.11 +/- 0.01 mm2, ramipril 0.08 +/- 0.01 mm2; P < 0.05; ramipril plus icatibant 0.09 +/- 0.01 mm2; NS, ramipril plus icatibant versus control). Thus ramipril was not effective when treatment was stopped after 3 or 5 days, but was mildly effective when treatment was administered during the second week. The effect on migration was studied by counting the number of neointimal cells in rats treated from 2 days before to 4 days after injury. Ramipril decreased the number of cells by 93% compared with controls (control 65.0 +/- 13.5 cells/slice, ramipril 4.7 +/- 2.0 cells/slice; P < 0.001), and this effect was blunted significantly by icatibant (19.5 +/- 5.7 cells/slice; P < 0.009, versus ramipril; P < 0.007, versus controls). The influence of treatment on the rate of proliferation (the 5'-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine index) was studied in the media 3 days, and in the neointima 7 and 10 days after balloon injury. Although proliferation peaked in the neointima after 7 days, there were no differences among the groups at any time. Thus neither ramipril nor icatibant affected the rate of proliferation at the times sampled. Ramipril increased cell density (cells/mm2) in the neointima, and this effect was abolished by cotreatment with icatibant (P < 0.05).", 
    "417": "The ACEI needs to be present throughout the experimental period to be most effective. ACEI act on neointima formation in part by inhibiting migration; thus, because ramipril was mildly effective when administered from 7 to 10 days after injury, it is likely that vascular smooth muscle cell migration also occurs continuously. Kinins help mediate roughly 30% of the effect of ACEI on migration. In addition, ACEI, through kinins, affect a process that increases the density of the cells in the neointima, perhaps by decreasing extracellular matrix deposition.", 
    "418": "To compare, using data from published studies, the efficacy of chronic inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system in inducing persistent downregulation of hemodynamic and cardiovascular structural changes in an adult rat with established genetic hypertension with the widely accepted known downregulation in young genetically hypertensive rats.", 
    "419": "We report on 36 studies that satisfied our inclusion criteria (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor antagonist treatment that lowered arterial pressure levels for at least 3 weeks). Of the 24 studies concerning developing hypertensive rats, a significant number (n = 17) also examined the persistence of any hemodynamic or cardiovascular effects after withdrawal of treatment. Conversely, of 15 studies using adult rats only seven and three reported on post-treatment hemodynamic and cardiovascular structural indices respectively.", 
    "420": "During treatment the hemodynamic and cardiovascular structural changes produced were qualitatively and quantitatively similar in the young and adult treated rats. Critical assessment of the persistence of these effects after withdrawal of treatment again found qualitatively similar responses. However, the strength of this finding is limited by the paucity of studies concerning adult rats in which equivalent treatment durations and equipressor doses of treatments were compared between these two age groups.", 
    "421": "Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system appears to have an efficacy in reversing established hypertension and hypertrophy similar to that with which it prevents the development of hypertension and hypertrophy. This partial 'cure' of hypertension after withdrawal of treatment is clearly evident when treatment is initiated during the development of hypertension and appears to be similar even when treatment is initiated in established hypertension.", 
    "422": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are excellent antihypertensive agents and are becoming widely used as first-line therapy for chronic hypertension in women of reproductive age owing to their efficacy and few side effects. Reports of adverse fetal and neonatal effects from the use of ACE inhibitors in pregnancy in both animal and human studies prompted recommendations against their use in human pregnancy by several authors. This review discusses the mechanism of action of ACE inhibitors and the use of ACE inhibitors in pregnancy both in experimental animals and use in human pregnancy. ACE inhibitors used during pregnancy may have untoward effects on the fetus. Based on reports in the literature, one should avoid starting ACE inhibitors during pregnancy and discontinue them in current users if at all possible.", 
    "423": "To test the hypothesis that angiotensin II modulates the physiological responses to furosemide in the newborn, various parameters of cardiovascular, renal, and endocrine function were measured before and after iv injection of furosemide to eight conscious, chronically instrumented lambs in the presence and absence of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, captopril. During ACE inhibition, the rise in heart rate and decrease in renal blood flow in response to furosemide did not occur, and the natriuretic and diuretic responses to furosemide were attenuated by approximately two-thirds. There was also an increase in the urinary excretion of prostaglandin F2 and prostaglandin F1 alpha as well as an increase in the excretion of prostaglandin E2 after furosemide, in the presence of ACE inhibition. Therefore, the cardiovascular, renal, and endocrine responses to furosemide in conscious lambs were significantly altered by ACE inhibition.", 
    "424": "Angioedema is a rare but potentially life-threatening adverse effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) which usually occurs within the first weeks of therapy. We report three patients in whom ACEI-induced angioedema began with a late onset of 12-33 months, and who had an irregular, unpredictable course under ACEI therapy. In two patients, other drugs or trauma appeared to trigger some of the episodes. After withdrawal of the ACEI, the trigger drugs were well tolerated in provocation tests and upon re-exposure. To avoid putting some patients unnecessarily at risk for long periods, one should consider this irregular pattern of ACEI-induced angioedema and regularly monitor patients for this adverse effect.", 
    "425": "A case control study has reported a 60% higher risk of myocardial infarction in hypertensives treated with a calcium channel blocker (CCB). We examined the Department of Health Hypertension Care Computing Project (DHCCP) data to see if we could confirm or refute this suggestion.",

    "427": "A total of 9328 subjects were included in the analyses and 2154 died. Of these, 6406 received one or more of the following index drugs: 26% a calcium channel blocker (CCB); 84% a diuretic; 29% alpha methyldopa; 12% a beta-blocker (BB); and 11% an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. The CCBs were nifedipine, diltiazem or verapamil.", 
    "428": "In the case control studies a group given diuretics +/- other treatments (but not including one of the index drugs) provided a reference group with a relative risk (RR) of 1.0. In the matched case control study the adjusted RR for a CCB without a diuretic was 1.32 (95% CI 0.64-2.70) for IHD mortality and 1.05 (95% CI 0.60-1.84) for cardiovascular mortality. Similar results were observed for methyldopa, BBs and ACE inhibitors. The results in the unmatched case control analysis were also similar. The longitudinal study comparing all those treated for over 1 year with a CCB with all other treatments showed a RR for total mortality of 1.03 (95% CI 0.85-1.25). The longitudinal study of total mortality according to treatment initiated at 3-12 months found results of a similar magnitude for CCBs, methyldopa and BBs.", 
    "429": "The reference diuretic group had less severe cardiovascular disease than other groups. Treatment with a CCB, BB or methyldopa was associated with an excess mortality in comparison with this reference group. The excess was similar in the different drug groups.", 
    "430": "Two peptides, LVV-hemorphin-5 and VV-hemorphin-5, were isolated from a defined peptic bovine hemoglobin hydrolysate by reversed-phase HPLC. These peptides were identified as 31-38 and 32-38 fragments of beta chain of bovine hemoglobin. Their inhibitory activity towards angiotensin-converting enzyme and opioid potency were determined. Since their amino acid sequences show close homology with spinorphin, which is found in human cerebrospinal fluid and in the bovine spinal cord, the possible physiological role in vivo of these peptides was discussed.", 
    "431": "The effect of the administration of captopril on Zn (zinc), Cu (copper), Ca (calcium) and Mg (magnesium) concentrations in guinea pig tissues was studied. For nine weeks 2 mg captopril per kg b.w. were administered daily to adult male guinea pigs intraperitoneally. The concentrations of the studied metals were determined in several tissues. Captopril significantly decreased Zn concentration in liver, Cu concentration in liver, adrenals, jejunum, urine and hair and Mg concentrations in blood and urine. A significant increase was observed in testicular and epididymal Zn, in heart, epididymal and fecal Cu, in Mg concentration of lung, kidney, adrenals, jejunum, epididymis and hair and in Ca concentrations in brain, heart, lung, kidney, spleen and stomach. No significant changes were observed in the colon and the thigh bone concentrations of the various elements tested. In conclusion Captopril treatment can produce translocation and/or elimination of Zn, Cu, Mg and Ca ions in various tissues of guinea pigs.", 
    "432": "The cardiovascular activities of crude water extract (WE) of Andrographis paniculata (Burm. f.) Nees (Acanthaceae), its three semi-purified ethyl acetate (FA), n-butanol (FB) and aqueous (FC) fractions, as well as andrographolide, a major plant constituent, were elucidated in anaesthetized Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats for the very first time. FA and andrographolide, which possesses multiple pharmacological activities, elicited no drop in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), while WE, FB and FC produced a significant fall in MAP in a dose-dependent manner without significant decrease in heart rate. The ED50 values for WE, FB and FC were 11.4, 5.0 and 8.6 mg/kg-respectively. These suggested that the hypotensive substance(s) of the crude water extract was concentrated in FB. Pharmacological antagonist studies were consequently only tested in FB (5 mg/kg). The hypotensive action of FB was not mediated through effects on the beta-adrenoceptor, muscarinic cholinergic receptor and angiotensin-converting enzyme, for it was not affected by propranolol, atropine and captapril, respectively. However, it seems to work via alpha-adrenoceptors, autonomic ganglion and histaminergic receptors, since the hypotensive effect of FB was negated or attenuated in the presence of phentolamine, hexamethonium as well as pyrilamine and cimetidine.", 
    "433": "The therapeutic effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, lisinopril, on puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN)-induced nephrosis were investigated using unilaterally nephrectomized rats. Lisinopril showed potent dual effects on PAN nephrosis. Lisinopril treatment (50 mg/l in drinking water) from day 5 or day 9 reduced urinary protein excretion and suppressed the development of glomerular sclerosis at 8 weeks after PAN injection (150 mg/kg, i.p.), indicating a therapeutic effect on the nephrosis. Recovery of decreased anionic charge sites on the glomerular basement membrane was involved, at least in part, in the therapeutic action of lisinopril against proteinuria. On the other hand, oliguria and progressive azotemia derived from continuous deterioration of the renal function was induced if the treatment of lisinopril was started on the same day as PAN injection. The renal dysfunction induced by simultaneous administration of lisinopril with PAN could be abolished by combination dosing with sarcosine, an angiotensin II (AII)-receptor agonist. These results indicate that lisinopril treatment attenuates proteinuria by ameliorating the anionic charge barrier on the glomerular basement membrane and that it also protects against the development of chronic renal disease with segmental glomerular sclerosis, although AII depletion during the acute nephrotic stage exacerbates the renal damage in PAN nephrosis of unilaterally nephrectomized rats.", 
    "434": "The continued acquisition of information on the distribution of expression of components of the renin-angiotensin system shows that it has functions in the tissues that are quite unrelated to its systemic actions. In particular, both type 1 and type 2 angiotensin receptors are found in many tissues of the reproductive system of both sexes. In addition, the widespread occurrence of (pro)renin, angiotensin converting enzyme and angiotensinogen suggests that the generation of angiotensin II within the tissues occurs at sites close to its sites of action. The data suggest that angiotensin II operates as an important paracrine agent with profoundly significant roles in several functions of the reproductive system, and in fertility.", 
    "435": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors can be used to prevent the development of radiation nephropathy after BMT. In previous BMT nephropathy studies, ACE inhibitor therapy was started pre-BMT and continued indefinitely. In preparation for clinical trials, studies were designed to determine whether effective prophylaxis could be achieved if ACE inhibitor therapy was started after engraftment, and to determine whether ACE inhibitors needed to be given indefinitely. The present studies in our rat syngeneic BMT model showed that captopril therapy started 25 days post-BMT was as effective as therapy started prior to BMT. When ACE inhibitor therapy was discontinued 28 weeks after BMT, the protective effect was not lost if adequate control of azotemia had been maintained for 26 weeks. If adequate control of azotemia was not maintained for 26 weeks, BMT nephropathy progressed rapidly when ACE inhibitor therapy ended, and slowly when it was continued. Failure to control azotemia was a better predictor of renal failure than failure to control hypertension or proteinuria. Based on these preclinical studies, it would appear that ACE inhibitor therapy will be effective in the prophylaxis of BMT nephropathy even if begun after engraftment, and that ACE inhibitors may not need to be given indefinitely.", 
    "436": "Despite the remarkable advances in cardiovascular therapeutics over the past four decades, little impact has been made on either the incidence or mortality rate of congestive heart failure and it remains a major clinical and public health problem. Recent practice audits have suggested that proven efficacious therapies are not maximally applied in patients with this condition. An approach to the patient with congestive heart failure is presented, emphasizing the two distinct syndromes of systolic dysfunction and diastolic dysfunction. Treatment recommendations are derived from consideration of the underlying pathophysiology and the evidence from randomised clinical trials.", 
    "437": "Heart failure and atrial fibrillation are very common, particularly in the elderly. Owing to common risk factors both disorders are often present in the same patient. In addition, there is increasing evidence of a complex, reciprocal relation between heart failure and atrial fibrillation. Thus heart failure may cause atrial fibrillation, with electromechanical feedback and neurohumoral activation playing an important mediating role. In addition, atrial fibrillation may promote heart failure; in particular, when there is an uncontrolled ventricular rate, tachycardiomyopathy may develop and thereby heart failure. Eventually, a vicious circle between heart failure and atrial fibrillation may form, in which neurohumoral activation and subtle derangement of rate control are involved. Treatment should aim at unloading of the heart, adequate control of ventricular rate, and correction of neurohumoral activation. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors may help to achieve these goals. Treatment should also include an attempt to restore sinus rhythm through electrical cardioversion, though appropriate timing of cardioversion is difficult. His bundle ablation may be used to achieve adequate rate control in drug refractory cases.", 
    "438": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, fosinopril, has an antihypertensive effect in patients undergoing heart transplantation (HT), as well as any action on lipid levels (total cholesterol and its fractions, triglycerides and lipoprotein[a] [Lp(a)]).", 
    "439": "The study included 15 male patients aged 54 +/- 10 years; nine had undergone transplantation as a result of ischemic heart disease and six as a result of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. The average time from the heart transplantation was 12 +/- 4 months. Six transplantations were performed after antidiabetic treatment, and six were performed with patients receiving a hypolipidemic agent. The subjects of the study were patients with mild to moderate hypertension who were receiving antihypertensive treatment; the antihypertensive medications were withdrawn during 7 days. Periodic blood pressure and basal analytic determinations were then carried out after 4 and 12 weeks of treatment and 7 days after withdrawal of the antihypertensive medications.", 
    "440": "Significant differences (p < 0.05) were found in the systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) compared with the basal values (SBP 160 +/- 11 mm Hg; DBP 98 +/- 8 mm Hg), after 4 weeks of treatment (SBP 138 +/- 10 mm Hg; DBP 83 +/- 7 mm Hg), and after 12 weeks of treatment (SBP 137 +/- 12 mm Hg; DBP 84 +/- 9 mm Hg); these differences persisted 7 days after the drug was withdrawn (SBP 150 +/- 12 mm Hg; DBP 95 +/- 10 mm Hg). The total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and Lp(a) dropped compared with the basal levels (total cholesterol 184 +/- 19, LDL cholesterol 123 +/- 13, Lp(a) 29 +/- 12), after 4 weeks (total cholesterol 172 +/- 21, LDL cholesterol 116 +/- 8, Lp(a) 26 +/- 8) and after 12 weeks (total cholesterol 169 +/- 20, LDL cholesterol 115 +/- 6, Lp(a) 25 +/- 8) of treatment, returning to basal values on withdrawal of the drug.", 
    "441": "Fosinopril is a useful drug for the treatment of the mild to moderate arterial hypertension of heart transplant recipients, in addition to being capable of reducing the serum levels of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and Lp(a). It should therefore be considered a first-line antihypertensive agent with beneficial effects on the lipid profile.", 
    "442": "Recent clinical trials have demonstrated that the administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors to patients with myocardial infarction reduces the incidence of recurrent myocardial infarction. It has also been reported that an elevated level of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) appears to constitute a marker of the risk of recurrent coronary thrombosis. To determine whether the ACE inhibitor captopril reduces plasma PAI inhibitor activity, we measured changes in plasma PAI activity (IU/ml), tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) antigen (ng/ml), and serum ACE activity (IU/L) in 14 survivors of myocardial infarction receiving captopril therapy (37.5 mg daily) and compared them with the values in 15 placebo-treated patients chosen at random. Blood sampling was performed at 07.00 h. In the captopril-treated group, serum ACE activity decreased significantly, from 14.0 +/- 0.8 to 11.5 +/- 1.2 IU/L 24 h after captopril therapy (p < 0.01), and those of PAI activity and t-PA antigen also decreased significantly-from 11.9 +/- 2.8 to 5.5 +/- 2.2 IU/ml (p < 0.02) and from 9.9 +/- 1.0 to 7.5 +/- 0.9 ng/ml (p < 0.05), respectively 48 h after captopril therapy. However, the levels of ACE activity, PAI activity, and t-PA antigen remained unchanged during the study period in the placebo group. Thus, our data indicate that the administration of captopril to patients with acute myocardial infarction may result in a reduced frequency of recurrent coronary thrombosis by increasing fibrinolytic capacity.", 
    "443": "1. The effects of the ACE inhibitor enalapril were studied in rats with cardiac hypertrophy induced by abdominal aortic constriction. This experimental model has shown that pump failure can be evidenced only during increased workload. 2. Under basal conditions, enalapril at 1-3 mg/kg induced a significant reduction in blood pressure. During the acute volume loading or the increase in afterload due to a total aortic occlusion, only rats treated with 3 mg/kg enalapril, but not 1 mg/kg, received a hemodynamic benefit that was paralleled by a significant reduction in cardiac hypertrophy. 3. The present study demonstrates that reduction in blood pressure on its own was not sufficient to improve cardiac function. A decrease in blood pressure accompanied with hypetrophy regression were necessary to normalize hemodynamic parameters in pressure-overloaded rats.",

    "448": "Effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, captopril, enalapril maleate and quinapril, on the uptake of aminocephalosporin antibiotic, cefroxadine, by rabbit small intestinal brush border membrane vesicles were examined. These ACE inhibitors significantly inhibited the uptake of cefroxadine, which is transported by H+/dipeptide transporter in the membrane, in the order of captopril < enalapril < quinapril in the presence of an inward H+ gradient. Inhibitory effect of quinapril was more marked than that of aminocephalosporin cephradine, while in the absence of an inward H+ gradient inhibition by these ACE inhibitors was much less. Dixon plot analysis showed that the inhibition by enalapril and quinapril in the presence of an inward H+ gradient occurred in a competitive manner and estimated inhibition constants of these two drugs to be 5.3 mM and 0.46 mM, respectively. These results suggested the strong affinity of these ACE inhibitors, especially quinapril, on the H+/dipeptide transporter.", 
    "449": "Chronic hypoxia induces pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular hypertrophy. These changes are completely reversible, except for persistent myocardial fibrosis. The aim of the present study was to determine whether treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril can reduce the ventricular collagen content in animals recovering from chronic hypoxia. Adult male Wistar rats were exposed to intermittent high-altitude hypoxia simulated in a barochamber (7000 m, 8 hr/day, 5 days a week, 24 exposures), then transferred to normoxia and divided into two groups: (a) treated with enalapril (0.1 g/kg/day for 60 days) and (b) without treatment. The corresponding control groups were kept under normoxic conditions. Enalapril significantly decreased the heart rate, systemic arterial pressure, and absolute left and right ventricular weights in both hypoxic and control rats; on the other hand, the pulmonary blood pressure was unchanged. The content and concentration of collagen was reduced in both ventricles of enalapril-treated hypoxic and control animals by 10-26% compared with the corresponding untreated groups. These data suggest that the partial regression of cardiac fibrosis due to enalapril may be independent of the pressure load.", 
    "450": "Most of the classic functions of the renin-angiotensin system are mediated by type 1 (AT1) angiotensin receptors, of which two subtypes, AT1A and AT1B, have been identified. However, distinct functions for these two AT1 receptors have been difficult to separate. We examined the pressor effects of angiotensin II in Agtr1A -/- mice, which lack AT1A receptors. In enalapril-pretreated Agtr1A -/- mice, angiotensin II caused significant and dose-proportional increases in mean arterial pressure. This pressor response was not blocked by pretreatment with sympatholytic agents but was completely inhibited by the AT1-receptor antagonists, losartan and candesartan, suggesting that it is directly mediated by AT1B receptors. Chronic treatment of Agtr1A -/- mice with losartan reduced systolic blood pressure from 80 +/- 5 to 72 +/- 4 mmHg (P < 0.04), suggesting a role for AT1B receptors in chronic blood pressure regulation. These studies provide the first demonstration of in vivo pressor effects mediated by AT1B receptors and demonstrate that, when AT1A receptors are absent, the AT1B receptor contributes to the regulation of resting blood pressure.", 
    "451": "A combined treatment of a 3-day regimen of pCPA and low-dose scopolamine produced a significant deficit in the acquisition of a water maze task, which has been suggested as a model for the cognitive deficits of Alzheimer's disease. The putative cognition enhancers oxotremorine, captopril, ondansetron, and tacrine were used in attempts to alleviate the water maze impairment. The effects of oxotremorine were difficult to determine due to nonspecific motor effects causing alterations in swimming speed. No evidence for cognition-enhancing properties of captopril was found. Ondansetron showed a cognition-enhancing effect on one of 4 days, but only at a relatively high dose (1 mg/kg i.p.). Tacrine, however, alleviated the pCPA + scopolamine-induced cognitive deficit. This study may thus provide evidence for the usefulness of tacrine in treating spatial deficits in dementia.", 
    "452": "It has been reported that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have beneficial effects on insulin resistance and congestive heart failure, in which elevations of serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) level have been indicated. Therefore, in this study, we examined effect of ACE inhibitors on TNF-alpha production both in vitro and in vivo by using human blood mononuclear cells and mice, respectively. LPS (20 micrograms/ml)-induced in vitro TNF-alpha production, measured by bioassay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, was significantly inhibited with captopril, delapril and cilazapril in a concentration of 10(-3) mol/l. A single, oral administration of captopril, delapril and cilazapril at more than 10-fold doses of common clinical use in man significantly inhibited LPS (2 mg/kg)-induced serum TNF-alpha activity in Balb/c mice. These results indicate that ACE inhibitors such as captopril, delapril and cilazapril have an inhibitory effect on TNF-alpha production not only in vitro as previously reported, but also in vivo, although relatively high concentrations and large doses were required in this study.", 
    "453": "In 14 patients (4 males and 10 females) with systemic hypertension plasma and erythrocyte lipid peroxides, plasma and erythrocyte catalase activity, plasma glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity, blood reduced glutathione (GSH) content and erythrocyte oxidant stress were investigated. All parameters were performed after clinical examination and then the patients were assigned to receive ACE inhibitor therapy, captopril (25-50 mg given twice per day) or enalapril (10-40 mg given twice per day). After six months the determination of lipid peroxides and antioxidative factors was repeated. At the beginning of the study both treated groups showed significantly higher plasma lipid peroxides compared to the control group. Both used ACE inhibitors produced significant decrease of plasma lipid peroxides after six months. Blood GSH content was also significantly higher in both patient groups before the treatment compared to the controls. Neither captopril nor enalapril produced any significant effect on GSH. Initial values of plasma GST activity in the patients were similar to the control group and did not significantly change after six month treatment. The patients assigned to receive enalapril showed significantly enhanced initial plasma catalase activity according to the controls. After six months treatment both ACE inhibitors significantly decreased plasma catalase activity. Erythrocyte lipid peroxides, erythrocyte catalase activity and oxidant stress of erythrocytes in both groups studied neither differ significantly at initial time of investigation according to the control group nor during or after six month treatment.", 
    "454": "Changes in valvular function and blood pressure level during long-term pharmacological anti-hypertensive therapy were investigated in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. Sixty-seven patients with hypertension (mean [+/-SD] 60 +/- 10 years) were followed up for 5.4 +/- 1.6 years with antihypertensive medication. During the follow-up period, valvular dysfunction was assessed by color Doppler echocardiography. Increased mitral valve regurgitation > or = grade II and/or aortic valve regurgitation > or = grade II were aggravated in 17 patients, whereas the other 50 patients did not reveal any significant changes in valvular functions. Systolic blood pressure and end-systolic wall stress at the end of the follow-up period were higher in the aggravated group (156 +/- 30 mmHg and 79 +/- 23 dyne/cm2) than in the unchanged group (143 +/- 17 mmHg and 63 +/- 18 dyne/cm2). Dimensions of the left atrium and left ventricle at both systole and diastole were enlarged in the aggravated group (37 +/- 4 to 40 +/- 4, 31 +/- 4 to 33 +/- 4 and 48 +/- 3 to 51 +/- 3 mm, respectively), but not in the unchanged group. Nine patients in the aggravated group received additional treatment with imidapril hydrochloride over 6 months in an attempt to further reduce blood pressure levels, resulting in significant improvements in systolic blood pressure (151 +/- 12 to 129 +/- 7 mmHg), diastolic blood pressure (91 +/- 4 to 79 +/- 8 mmHg), left atrial dimension (41 +/- 3 to 39 +/- 3 mm) and left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (49 +/- 4 to 48 +/- 3 mm). Adequate pharmacological intervention can ameliorate valvular dysfunction, left ventricular enlargement and increased ventricular wall stress.", 
    "455": "Many reports have shown inhibitory effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on the progression of atherosclerotic plaque lesions in vascular tissue of experimental models. However, no report has shown alterations of ACE activity in vascular tissue during the process of atherosclerosis. We measured ACE activity in plasma and aortic tissue in rabbits fed a cholesterol-rich (1%) or normal diet for 10 weeks. We also evaluated the blood pressure response to angiotensin (Ang) I and II. These data were compared in untreated rabbits and in rabbits receiving chronic treatment with an ACE inhibitor, enalapril (3 mg/kg/day for 10 weeks). ACE activity in aortic tissue, but not in plasma, in cholesterol-fed rabbits was gradually but significantly increased compared with that in noncholesterol-fed rabbits even after the 4-week feeding period, when no atherosclerotic lesion was observed in the aortic tissue. Treatment with enalapril for 10 weeks, but not 4 weeks, significantly reduced the ACE activity in aortic tissue in association with the reductions in the elevated Ang II level and the atherosclerotic plaque area of the aortic tissue. These results indicated that ACE activity in aortic tissue was increased during the early phase of atherosclerotic process.",

    "458": "In the absence of any exogenous agonists, the inhibition of neutral endopeptidase and angiotensin-converting enzyme by phosphoramidon and captopril, respectively, increased the frequency and magnitude of spontaneous motility of isolated bladder strips. Phosphoramidon increased the net release of SP-like immunoreactivity (SP-LI) and captopril increased the net release of SP-LI and BK-LI, concomitant with contraction. Peptide-LI was recovered primarily from bladder mucosa and to a lesser degree from detrusor smooth muscle. Similarly, peptidase inhibitors primarily affected the bladder mucosa; phosphoramidon induced a fourfold increase in SP-LI and captopril induced a significant increase of SP-LI and BK-LI from the mucosa. Tissues contracted in response to peptidase inhibitors in the presence of atropine and indomethacin, but contraction was reduced significantly by in vitro capsaicin desensitization or removal of bladder mucosa. BK stimulated SP-LI release from mucosa but not detrusor. SP stimulated increased BK-LI release from mucosa and detrusor.",

    "460": "A progressive decline in glomerular function occurs in diabetic nephropathy. The predictive effects of progression promoters were examined in 182 non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients from a baseline serum creatinine concentration of 133 mumol/l. During a total of 605 person-years follow-up, 107 patients developed end-stage renal failure requiring dialysis. The rate of decline of renal function was highly variable. Urinary protein excretion was the strongest predictor correlated to the rate of decline, followed by diastolic and systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol and platelet count, while the protective effects were seen in serum albumin and haematocrit. Adjustment for urinary protein excretion revealed that diastolic blood pressure, familial predisposition to hypertension, serum albumin, and smoking were independent significant predictors. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) significantly retarded the development of end-stage renal failure compared to antihypertensives other than ACE-I (mostly nifedipine), and the effect was evident particularly in patients with proteinuria below the median (2.5 g/24 h) (presumably those who responded to ACE-I). A complex effect of proteinuria in association with blood pressure elevation, familial predisposition to hypertension, hypoalbuminaemia, and smoking may play an important role in the progression of nephropathy.", 
    "461": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is known to play an important role in the pathobiology of human essential hypertension. Similarly, cis-unsaturated fatty acids, prostaglandins, and free radicals are believed to play a role in the control of blood pressure. It was observed that all the cis-unsaturated fatty acids tested can inhibit ACE activity to a significant degree. On the other hand, prostaglandins and free radicals, superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radical did not show significant inhibitory effects on ACE activity in vitro. But, the nitric oxide donor sodium nitroprusside showed a potent inhibitory action on ACE activity, suggesting that one of the possible mechanism(s) by which nitric oxide can bring about its anti-hypertensive action might be by modulating ACE activity in addition to its direct vasodilator action. These results indicate that there is a close interaction among ACE activity, cis-unsaturated fatty acids, and nitric oxide, which may have relevance to the pathobiology of human essential hypertension.",

    "463": "In the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, 2912 US physicians reported on 16,968 office visits in 1991-1992 with patients aged > or = 65 years. National estimates were obtained from weighted results that accounted for the complex sampling design.", 
    "464": "An estimated 8.3 million (2.6%) office visits with older adults involved heart failure. This included 9.3% of visits to cardiologists, 4.3% to internists, 3.5% to general and family physicians, and 0.6% to other physicians. The most frequently prescribed medications during visits with these patients were diuretics (69%), digitalis compounds (46%), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (30%), and nitrates (19%). Internists and general and family physicians prescribed angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, digitalis compounds, and loop diuretics for patients with heart failure less often than did cardiologists.", 
    "465": "These are the first national surveillance estimates of physician practices in the management of heart failure. These data were collected during the same period in which heart failure clinical trial results were initially published, and they provide a baseline for monitoring the influence of recent clinical practice guidelines and professional education on changes in the management of heart failure by primary care physicians.", 
    "466": "We examined the effects of two exercise training modalities, i.e., low-intensity endurance and sprint running, on in vitro, isovolumic myocardial performance following ischemia and reperfusion. Rats ran on a treadmill 5 d.wk-1 for 6 wk at the following levels: endurance; 20 m.min-1, 0% grade, 60 min.d-1 and sprint; five 1-min runs at 75 m.min-1, 15% grade interspersed with 1-min active recovery runs at 20 m.min-1, 15% grade. Both endurance and sprint training significantly improved exercise tolerance relative to control (P < 0.05) on two graded exercise tests. Buffer perfused hearts of control (N = 18), endurance (N = 20), and sprint (N = 13) trained animals underwent no-flow ischemia (20 min) and reperfusion (30 min) in a Langendorff mode. During reperfusion, left ventricular developed pressure and its first derivative were 20% higher in sprint (P < 0.05) than either endurance or control hearts. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was lowest in sprint during reperfusion (sprint, 10 +/- 1 mm Hg vs endurance, 14 +/- 2 mm Hg; and control, 14 +/- 2 mm Hg, at 30 min reperfusion). Hearts were then used for biochemical studies or dissociated into single cells for measurement of contraction, cell calcium, and action potential duration. Single cell contractions were greatest in sprint despite similar calcium transients in all groups. Ischemia/reperfusion caused action potential prolongation in control but not trained myocytes. Hearts from sprint had the greatest glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity (P < 0.05) and a tendency towards increased superoxide dismutase activity. These results suggest that sprinting increases myocardial resistance to ischemia/reperfusion. This protection may be secondary to increased myofilament calcium sensitivity and/or myocardial expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.", 
    "467": "The Joint National Committee V suggested that combination therapy can provide effective blood pressure control in patients with stage I-IV hypertension. This 4 x 4 factorial trial design assessed the efficacy of monotherapy with trandolapril-an ACE inhibitor, and verapamil SR-a calcium antagonist, each in a range of 3 doses as monotherapy, and in combination therapy in patients with stage I-III diastolic hypertension. After a 4-week, single-blind placebo treatment period, 746 patients in 39 study centers were randomized to 1 of the 16 double-blind treatments for 6 weeks (placebo, verapamil SR monotherapy 120, 180, or 240 mg; trandolapril monotherapy 0.5, 2, or 8 mg; and trandolapril/verapamil SR combinations 0.5/120, 0.5/180, 0.5/240, 2/120, 2/180, 2/240, 8/120, 8/180, or 8/240 mg. Both mono and combination therapies achieved the primary efficacy parameters: lowered diastolic blood pressure (at trough) more than placebo, p < 01 (except the 120 mg verapamil SR, NS, 0.5 mg trandolapril, 0.5/180 and 2/120 combinations, p < 05), yielded a trough to peak ratio of > 0.52 and had higher percentages of responders compared to placebo. Combination therapy was more effective than monotherapy for sitting diastolic blood pressure 2/180, p < 01; 2/240 and 8/240, p < 05. There were no differences between active treatment groups and placebo as a percentage of patients having adverse reactions. Trandolapril, 2 and 8 mg, appeared to have a greater incremental effect on the systolic blood pressure reduction of the combination than verapamil SR 180 and 240 mg.", 
    "468": "Plasma angiotensinogen (Ao) concentration (PAC), urinary Ao excretion (UAE), hepatic levels of Ao mRNA and plasma renin concentration (PRC) were studied in control and nephrotic rats subjected to the following treatments: dexamethasone (DEX), ethinyl-estradiol (EE), tri-iodothyronine (T3), bilateral nephrectomy (NX), captopril (CAP) and adrenalectomy (ADX). In nephrotic rats PAC diminished, UAE and PRC augmented and Ao mRNA levels were not altered. In control rats, DEX, EE, T3 and NX increased PAC and Ao mRNA levels whereas CAP diminished PAC but not affected Ao mRNA. ADX diminished PAC and Ao mRNA levels. In nephrotic rats, these treatments produced the same effect than in control rats except in ADX which did not affect PAC. These data suggest that the decreased PAC is not related to alterations in hepatic Ao gene expression but to elevated PRC and UAE.", 
    "469": "KII ACE, the enzyme that converts angiotensin I and inactivates bradykinin, is highly concentrated in the lungs; its blockade reduces exposure to angiotensin II and enhances exposure to prostaglandins generated by local kinin hyperconcentration. Our hypothesis is that ACE inhibitors improve pulmonary function in chronic heart failure (CHF) by readjusting lung vessel tone and permeability or alveolar-capillary membrane diffusion.", 
    "470": "In 16 CHF patients and 16 normal volunteers or mild untreated hypertensives, pulmonary function and exercise tests with respiratory gas analysis were assessed on placebo, enalapril (10 mg BID), enalapril plus aspirin (325 mg/d), or aspirin, in random order and double blind, for 15 days each. In CHF, enalapril increased pulmonary carbon monoxide diffusion (DLCO), oxygen consumption (VO2), and exercise tolerance and reduced the ratio of dead space to tidal volume (VD/VT) and the ventilatory equivalent for carbon dioxide production (VE/VCO2). On enalapril, VO2 (r = .80, P < .0001) and VD/VT (r = -.69, P = .003) changes from placebo correlated with those in DLCO. These effects were inhibited by aspirin and were absent in control subjects. In 8 additional patients, hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate, as an alternative treatment for reducing pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) and increasing exercise capacity, were more effective than enalapril for the PCWP but did not affect DLCO and VE/VCO2; amelioration in VO2 and VD/VT was unrelated to DLCO and was not modified by aspirin.", 
    "471": "ACE inhibition improved pulmonary diffusion in CHF. Hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate failed to provide this result.

Additional groups of infarcted rats were treated with the ACE inhibitor lisinopril or the AT1 receptor antagonist ZD7155, each separately and in combination with icatibant. B2 kinin receptor blockade enhanced the interstitial deposition of collagen after MI, whereas morphological and molecular markers of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy (cardiac weight, myocyte cross-sectional area, prepro-atrial natriuretic factor mRNA expression) were not affected. Chronic ACE inhibition and AT1 receptor blockade reduced collagen deposition and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy after MI. The inhibitory action of ACE inhibition and AT1 receptor blockade on interstitial collagen was partially reversed by B2 kinin receptor blockade. However, B2 kinin receptor blockade did not attenuate the effects of ACE inhibition and AT1 receptor blockade on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.",

Of the patients treated with carvedilol, 8 underwent exercise training and 8 remained sedentary. All 7 patients treated with propranolol underwent exercise training. Peak oxygen consumption (mL.kg-1.min-1) was serially measured in trained and sedentary patients. Peak reactive hyperemia (mL.min-1.100 mL-1) was determined in the calf and forearm immediately before and after 12 weeks of training. The peak oxygen consumption of trained patients treated with either carvedilol or propranolol increased from 12.9 +/- 1.4 to 16.0 +/- 1.6 (P < .001) and 12.4 +/- 1.0 to 15.7 +/- 0.9 (P < .001) mL.kg-1.min-1, respectively, whereas it did not change in the sedentary patients.

    "478": "1. The vasoconstrictor peptide antiotensin II (AII) can stimulate angiogenesis, an important process in wound healing, tumour growth and chronic inflammation. To elucidate mechanisms underlying AII-enhanced angiogenesis, we have studied a subcutaneous sponge granuloma model in the rat by use of 133Xe clearance, morphometry and quantitative in vitro autoradiography. 2. When injected directly into the sponge, AII (1 nmol day-1) increased 133Xe clearance from, and fibrovascular growth in sponge granulomas, indicating enhanced angiogenesis 6 to 12 days after implantation. This AII-enhanced angiogenesis was inhibited by daily doses (100 nmol/sponge) of the specific but subtype non-selective AII receptor antagonist (Sar1, Ile8)AII, and by the selective non-peptide AT1 receptor antagonists losartan and DuP 532. In contrast, AII-enhanced neovascularization was not inhibited by the AT2 receptor antagonist PD123319, nor was it mimicked by the AT2 receptor agonist CGP42112A (each at 100 nmol/sponge day-1). 3. AI (1 nmol/sponge day-1), the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors captopril (up to 100 micrograms/sponge day-1) and lisinopril (40 micrograms/sponge day-1), or AII receptor antagonists did not affect angiogenesis in the absence of exogenous AII. 4. [125I]-(Sar1, Ile8)AII binding sites with characteristics of AT1 receptors were localized to microvessels and to non-vascular cells within the sponge stroma from 4 days after implantation, and were at higher density than in skin throughout the study. 5. [125I]-(Sar1, Ile8)AII binding sites with characteristics of AT2 receptors were localized to non-vascular stromal cells, were of lower density and appeared later than did AT1 sites. 6. The ACE inhibitor [125I]-351A bound to sites with characteristics of ACE, 14 days after sponge implantation. [125I]-351A bound less densely to sponge stroma than to skin. 7. We propose that AII can stimulate angiogenesis, acting via AT1 receptors within the sponge granuloma. AT1 and AT2 receptors and ACE develop sequentially during microvascular maturation, and the role of the endogenous angiotensin system in angiogenesis will depend on the balanced local expression of its various components. Pharmacological modulation of this balance may provide novel therapeutic approaches in angiogenesis-dependent diseases.",

Optimal therapy requires a knowledge of the pharmacologic properties of the six broad classes of antihypertensive drugs: diuretics, sympatholytics (including central and peripheral adrenergic receptor blockers), direct vasodilators, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers and angiotensin II receptor antagonists.", 
    "480": "The objective of this study was to examine whether there are international variations in the use of evidence-based medical therapy in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary revascularization. We analyzed the medical therapy of patients in the United States (US) (n = 878), Europe (n = 134), and Canada (n = 274) who underwent percutaneous coronary revascularization in either the Coronary Angioplasty Versus Excisional Atherectomy Trial (CAVEAT-I) (enrollment from August 1991 to April 1992) or the Canadian Coronary Atherectomy Trial (CCAT) (enrollment from July 1991 to August 1992). We found that at the time of hospital admission, Canadian patients had the highest rates of treatment with aspirin (95% vs 57% US and 78% Europe; p = 0.002), calcium antagonists (75% vs 48% US and 43% Europe; p 0.0001), beta blockers (60% vs 32% US and 46% Europe; p = 0.02), and combination anti-ischemic therapy (67% vs 43% US and 56% Europe; p = 0.0001). By discharge, however, Canadian patients had the lowest rates of treatment with nitrates (12% vs 40% US and 44% Europe; p = 0.0001) and combination anti-ischemic therapy (29% vs 53% US and 47% Europe; p < 0.01). At both admission and discharge, rates of treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and lipid-lowering agents were < 15% in all 3 regions. We conclude that significant international variations exist in the use of evidence-based medical therapy in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary revascularization.", 
    "481": "Our objective was to determine whether patients with chronic renal failure requiring maintenance hemodialysis retain intrinsic renal function longer when using reprocessed polysulfone (PS) membrane hemodialyzers or single-use cellulose acetate (CA) membrane hemodialyzers. Fifty consecutive patients with residual renal function (urea clearance > 2.0 mL/min) using PS dialyzers were compared with a retrospective, disease- and time-matched population of patients using CA dialyzers. Endogenous urea clearance was measured every 3 months in all patients with remaining residual function. Other data collected included age, sex, cause of chronic renal failure, use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or calcium channel blockers, and hemodynamic stability during hemodialysis. All patients were observed for at least 6 months while using a single type of dialyzer. Study end points included loss of residual renal function (urea clearance < 1.0 mL/min), death, transplant, transfer to peritoneal dialysis, or change of dialyzer. The PS and CA groups of patients were well matched for sex, age, initial renal clearance, predialysis blood pressure, and hemodynamic stability during hemodialysis. The PS patients had a higher delivered Kt/V (1.34 +/- 0.30 [mean +/- SD]) than the CA patients (1.06 +/- 0.20). The PS group had a higher average urea clearance than the CA group after 4 to 9 months of dialysis (2.8 +/- 2.6 mL/min v 1.7 +/- 1.6 mL/min, respectively), after 10 to 15 months of chronic dialysis (2.0 +/- 2.4 mL/min v 1.1 +/- 1.5 mL/min, respectively), and after 16 to 21 months of dialysis (1.3 +/- 1.9 mL/min v 0.5 +/- 1.1 mL/min, respectively; all P < 0.03, t-test). After 22 to 24 months of dialysis, the difference between the two groups was not significant. When comparing patients with identical causes of chronic renal failure, there were no differences between the PS and CA groups for those with diabetes mellitus, tubulointerstitial disease, or polycystic disease. Patients with parenchymal renal disease (glomerulonephritis or nephrosclerosis) had markedly better retention of intrinsic renal function with PS than with CA dialyzers (all P < 0.01). Kaplan-Meier analysis for retention of intrinsic renal function showed that PS patients with parenchymal renal disease had a mean of 23 months before loss of intrinsic renal function, whereas for CA patients the mean was 11 months before loss of intrinsic renal function (P = 0.0005). Cellulose acetate patients lost renal function at an average rate of 0.27 +/- 0.22 mL/min/mo, whereas for PS patients the rate was 0.14 +/- 0.56 mL/min/mo (P = 0.06, rank sum). CA patients with parenchymal renal disease lost renal function at a rate of 0.29 +/- 0.22 mL/min/mo, whereas for PS patients the rate was 0.0 +/- 0.8 mL/min/mo (P = 0.004, rank sum). Age, sex, and the use of either angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or calcium channel blockers did not have an effect on the loss of intrinsic renal function. Patients with nondiabetic parenchymal renal disease receiving chronic hemodialysis with hydrogen peroxide/peroxyacetic acid-reprocessed PS dialyzers and a higher Kt/V lose residual renal function at a slower rate than disease-matched patients using single-use CA dialyzers. Our findings provide further evidence that the choice of dialyzer membrane may have an effect on intrinsic renal function.",

Mibefradil is a nonvoltage-regulated T-channel calcium blocker that differs from all the other currently available L-channel calcium blockers. The drug is a potent peripheral and coronary vasodilator, with no clinical negative inotropic activity. Furthermore, because of its long half-life, it can be given once a day and appears to be free of the common side effects seen with other calcium-channel blockers. The trial was designed to investigate whether the addition of mibefradil to standard therapy for heart failure will reduce mortality in patients with symptomatic heart failure.",

    "486": "The application of a new encoding technology for drug discovery is described. A combinatorial library of mercaptoacyl pyrrolidines has been prepared on a beaded polymeric support. Each polymer bead carries one library constituent in association with an oligomeric \"tag,\" the structure of which is a record of the specific reagents from which that library member was prepared. After the ligands were solubilized, an array of such beads was screened for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitory activity, and the structures of active pyrrolidines were deduced by analysis of the associated tags at sub-picomole levels. Several extremely potent enzyme inhibitors were identified, many from multiple beads. The most potent inhibitor was found to have a Ki of 160 pM, approximately 3-fold more active than captopril in the same assay. Direct comparison with iterative deconvolution shows that the encoded screening strategy is a much more efficient means for extracting information from such compound collections, producing more data on a larger number of active structures.", 
    "487": "We studied the expression of each component of the renin-angiotensin system (renin, angiotensin I-converting enzyme, angiotensinogen, and angiotensin II type I receptor) in balloon-injured rat carotid artery. We assessed the expression levels of the respective mRNAs by competitive polymerase chain reaction. Renin mRNA concentration was markedly increased 24 hours after balloon injury and remained higher than that in the control at 7 days after balloon injury. Angiotensin-converting enzyme mRNA concentration was decreased 24 hours after balloon injury and was increased at 14 days after balloon injury. No significant change in angiotensinogen mRNA concentration was observed throughout the study period. Angiotensin type I receptor mRNA concentration was increased beginning 3 days after balloon injury and remained higher than that in the control at 14 days after balloon injury. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that renin was transiently expressed in medial smooth muscle cells after balloon injury. Administration of quinapril markedly reduced neointimal formation and was accompanied by an attenuation of the increase in the concentrations of angiotensin type I receptor and angiotensin-converting enzyme mRNAs. The upregulation of renin mRNA in balloon-injured rat carotid artery preceded and may play a role in neointimal formation.", 
    "488": "We examined the effect of chronic human renin infusion and human renin inhibition on blood pressure in a unique transgenic rat model. We infused incremental doses of human renin (1 to 500 ng/h) with minipumps for 10 days into rats harboring the human angiotensinogen gene [TGR (hAOGEN)1623]. We measured blood pressure and heart rate continuously by telemetry. We found that human renin at 5 ng/h was necessary to increase blood pressure, whereas 10 ng/h caused systolic blood pressure to increase to 215 +/- 13 mm Hg. Heart rate decreased initially but then increased by 100 beats per minute compared with basal values. Drinking behavior also increased. Doses as high as 500 ng/h did not increase blood pressure further. A linear relationship was found between the log of plasma renin activity and systolic blood pressure that increased in slope from days 2 to 9. Rat angiotensinogen levels were low and not influenced by human renin infusion. Human angiotensinogen levels remained stable until 500 ng/h human renin was infused, at which time they decreased by 50% at 9 days. Rat renin gene expression (RNase protection assay) was decreased by human renin infusion, whereas rat and human angiotensinogen gene expressions in liver and kidney as well as angiotensin-converting enzyme gene expression in kidney were not affected. The human renin inhibitor Ro 42-5892 was given by gavage repeatedly to rats receiving human renin at 40 ng/h. Ro 42-5892 lowered blood pressure promptly to basal values. High human renin hypertension in this model is dose dependent, features a steeper relationship between blood pressure and plasma renin activity over time, and is associated with tachycardia and increased drinking. We conclude that the human angiotensinogen transgenic rat offers new perspectives in the study of human renin-induced hypertension.", 
    "489": "This study tested the dependence of insulin-induced hypertension in rats on a functional renin-angiotensin system. Rats were instrumented with chronic artery and vein catheters and housed in metabolic cages. After acclimation, 10 rats began receiving the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) benazepril at 1.8 mg.kg-1.d-1 via a continuous intravenous infusion that was maintained throughout the study; 8 control rats received vehicle. Four days after starting ACEI or vehicle, all rats entered a 5-day control period that was followed by a 7-day insulin infusion at 1.5 mU.kg-1.min-1. Glucose was coinfused at 22 mg.kg-1.min-1 to prevent hypoglycemia. Insulin infusion in control rats increased mean arterial pressure (MAP; measured 24 h/d) from an average of 101 +/- 1 to 113 +/- 2 mm Hg on day 1; MAP averaged 110 +/- 1 mm Hg for the 7-day infusion period. Glomerular filtration rate decreased, although not significantly, from 2.7 +/- 0.1 to 2.1 +/- 0.2 mL/min on day 3. Chronic ACEI decreased baseline MAP from an average of 97 +/- 1 to 79 +/- 1 mm Hg and markedly attenuated the increase in MAP during insulin. MAP averaged 81 +/- 1 mm Hg for the 7-day period and increased significantly, to 85 +/- 2 mm Hg, only on day 3. Likewise, the tendency for glomerular filtration rate to decrease was blunted. These results indicate that insulin-induced hypertension in rats depends on angiotensin II and suggest that a reduction in glomerular filtration rate contributes to the shift in pressure natriuresis.",

They have previously been identified at high concentration in human pituitary glands and in the CSF of patients with cerebral bleeding. Hemorphins are potent inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme and therefore possibly have a role to play in blood pressure regulation. We report the presence of four hemorphin peptides in extracts of normal adrenal tissue and in pheochromocytoma tumors. The hemorphins were quantified and structurally characterized using mass spectrometry. High concentrations of hemorphins were found in all samples, comparable with the levels reported in the literature for pituitary and brain tissue.", 
    "491": "Culture of mesangial cells (MCs) in 5.6 vs. 30.0 mmol/l glucose for 3 weeks induced a sustained increase in protein kinase C (PKC) activity, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 mRNA, bioactive TGF-beta, and collagen synthesis. Nitric oxide (NO), generated exogenously by the NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetyl, D,L-penicillamine (SNAP) or endogenously after the exposure of MC to interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), suppressed bioactive TGF-beta in MCs cultured in 5.6 or 30.0 mmol/l glucose and suppressed or abolished increases in TGF-beta1 mRNA and collagen synthesis induced by high concentrations of glucose or phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate without altering values obtained with normal glucose concentrations. SNAP had a transient suppressive effect on PKC activity, which may explain at least in part some of the actions of SNAP. The selective inhibitor of PKC, bisindolylmaleimide (GFX), mimicked NO action. The ability of SNAP and IL-1beta to suppress TGF-beta and collagen synthesis was not mediated by cGMP, since the cGMP analog, 8-Br-PET-cGMP, did not mimic NO action and an antagonist of cGMP-dependent protein kinase, Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPs, did not prevent the inhibitory actions of SNAP. N-omega-L-arginine methyl ester (NMMA) increased TGF-beta in glomerular capillary endothelial cells (GCECs) and stimulated collagen synthesis by MC in a co-culture with GCECs. Captopril inhibited TGF-beta and collagen synthesis and increased cGMP in co-cultures of GCECs and MCs. These effects of captopril were abolished by NMMA, implying mediation by NO. Thus, endogenous NO produced by GCECs may modulate TGF-beta production by both GCECs and MCs and act to suppress matrix protein synthesis by MCs.", 
    "492": "Although simultaneous pancreas and kidney transplantation (SPK) achieves normoglycemia and correction of uremia in type I diabetic patients with renal failure, little data are available on long-term outcome and clinical determinants of recovery of peripheral neuropathy. In this prospective study, 219 electrophysiological studies using a standardized protocol were performed before and up to 8 years after SPK in 44 patients. Nine control diabetic recipients with functioning kidney but nonfunctioning pancreas transplants were studied on 35 occasions. Patients were 38.5+/-7.9 years old (mean+/-SD) with pretransplant diabetes present for 25.2+/-7.6 years. Significant polyneuropathy (total nerve conduction scores [NCS] <-1.0) was present in 89% before transplantation, which correlated with body weight (r=0.628, P<0.001). Two distinct patterns of neurological recovery were observed after SPK. Conduction velocity (CV) improved in a biphasic pattern, with a rapid initial recovery followed by subsequent stabilization. In contrast, the recovery of nerve amplitude was monophasic, and continued to improve for up to 8 years. Initial improvement in NCS was primarily due to an increase in CV (P=0.002 vs. baseline), and was best in shorter and younger patients. Recovery of total NCS at 6 months after SPK, assessed by multivariate analysis, was least in obese recipients and when performed in patients who had started dialysis before SPK, and was associated with lower transplant kidney isotopic glomerular filtration rate and HLA mismatch (P<0.05 to 0.001). Subsequent improvement was associated with less severe initial neuropathy, smaller body weight, and longer duration of diabetes (P<0.01 to 0.001). Fasting hyperinsulinemia was associated with impairment of initial recovery and subsequent NCS after SPK, but was worse in the control group. Recovery of nerve action potential amplitudes was predicted by better initial amplitudes and HLA mismatch, lower body weight, and the use of nifedipine (P<0.05 to 0.001). Nifedipine was used for hypertension in 33% of SPK and was associated with better CV and amplitudes, particularly in the upper limbs, where there was less neuropathy. The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors also appeared beneficial, but this was confined to the lower limbs. SPK resulted in a gradual, sustained, and late improvement in nerve action potential amplitudes, consistent with axonal regeneration and partial reversal of diabetic neuropathy. These data suggest that early transplantation of uremic diabetic patients before onset of severe neuropathy, minimizing obesity and optimizing renal transplant function, maximizes neurological recovery after SPK. Furthermore, the preliminary data support randomized clinical trials for evaluation of nifedipine and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in diabetic neuropathy.", 
    "493": "A soluble 65582.9 Da (in MALDI-TOF) angiotensin converting (ACE)-like enzyme has been purified by a captopril-Sepharose affinity column chromatography from the mollusk Mytilus edulis. This glycosylated peptidyl dipeptidase, with an N-terminal sequence of LDPELSPGCFVANQAGGQLF, hydrolyses the Phe8-His9 bond (at pH 8.4 and 37 degrees C) of angiotensin I with a high catalytic activity i.e. Km: 168 microM and Kcat/Km: 262 s-1 mM-1. The hydrolysis of angiotensin I is inhibited by the specific ACE inhibitors captopril and lisonopril (Ic50 = 50 nM). This activity is increased by Cl- (optimal Cl- concentration 400 mM) and by Zn2+. This zinc metallopeptidase also attacks peptides having a Gly-His, Gly-Phe or a Phe-His bond in their sequence e.g. leucine-enkephalin (Kcat/Km: 1200 s-1 mM-1 or bradykinin (Kcat/Km: 2500 s-1 mM-1). Mytilus ACE displays properties of the C-domain of human ACE, indicating a high degree of conservation during evolution. These results are consistent with an ACE activity implicated in metabolism of several neuropeptides in mollusks.", 
    "494": "Anthracycline chemotherapy of cancer can cause severe, frequently fatal congestive heart failure (CHF), the first line treatment for which is diuretics and digoxin. We have studied the use of an ACE-inhibitor added as a third agent. Of 85 patients evaluable for cardiotoxicity after treatment with a median of 1000 mg/m2 of epirubicin for metastatic breast cancer, nine developed CHF at 1.5 to 13 months after therapy. Left ventricular ejection fraction decreased from normal to 18 to 35%. All patients received digitalo-diuretic therapy and after a transient clinical relief enalapril or ramipril increasing from 1.25 mg orally daily to 10-15 mg after 4-6 weeks. Eight of the nine patients deteriorated while on digitalo-diuretic therapy. Within three months of starting the ACE-inhibitor in these patients, LVEF increased to normal or near normal. Only one patient died in heart failure. Follow-up ranged from 11-42 months (median 26) and survival in the nine patients was similar to that of those who did not develop CHF. We suggest that treatment of anthracycline-induced CHF with an ACE-inhibitor should start within one to two weeks after digitalo-diuretic therapy regardless of the severity of symptoms rather than waiting for clinical deterioration.", 
    "495": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) are effective antihypertensive drugs, but use of ACEIs during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy has been associated with a pattern of defects known as ACEI fetopathy. The predominant feature of the fetopathy is renal tubular dysplasia. Other associated conditions include hypocalvaria, intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), and patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). These features may be related to fetal hypotension secondary to ACEI-induced decreases in fetal angiotensin or increased bradykinin. Although no adverse fetal effects have been linked to first trimester use of ACEIs, there has been no systematic evaluation of births to women with such exposures. To determine whether features of ACEI fetopathy occurred after first trimester exposure, in 1992 the Organization of Teratology Information Services (OTIS) in North America initiated the ACEI Registry; two members of the European Network of Teratology Information Services agreed to participate. This report presents findings from the ACEI Registry, which indicate that the infants of 66 women who self-reported first trimester only exposure to ACEI showed no evidence of renal tubular dysplasia.",

Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) is the main chemotactic factor involved in this phenomenon, and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) is one of the nuclear factors controlling its expression. ACE inhibitors have been useful in some experimental models of atherosclerosis. In this work, we addressed the hypothesis that angiotensin II (Ang II) may be implicated in the recruitment of monocytes into the vessel wall through the activation of NF-kappa B and the induction of MCP-1 expression.", 
    "497": "Accelerated atherosclerosis was induced in the femoral arteries of rabbits by endothelial desiccation and atherogenic diet for 7 days. Atherosclerotic vessels exhibited an increase in NF-kappa B-like activity, and p50 and p65 NF-kappa B subunits were identified as components of this activity. MCP-1 (mRNA and protein) was also expressed in the injured vessels coincidently with the neointimal macrophage infiltration. ACE inhibition with quinapril reduced these three parameters. In cultured monocytic and vascular smooth muscle cells. Ang II elicited an increase in NF-kappa B activation and MCP-1 expression that was prevented by preincubation of cells with pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate, an inhibitor of NF-kappa B activation.",

IF obtained from human skin contained substantial amounts of protease inhibitors and ACE activity, the concentration of alpha 1-antitrypsin being 35% and the activity of ACE 24% of the corresponding serum values. When heart homogenate was incubated with Ang I, three enzymes were responsible for its metabolism: heart chymase and heart ACE converted Ang I to Ang II, and heart carboxypeptidase A (CPA)-like activity degraded Ang I to Ang-(1-9). Incubation of heart homogenate in the presence of IF led to practically full inhibition of heart chymase-mediated Ang II formation by the natural protease inhibitors present in IF. In contrast, heart CPA-like activity was not blocked, as reflected by the continued generation of Ang-(1-9). In addition, both heart ACE- and IF ACE-mediated Ang II formation were strongly inhibited. This inhibition was shown to be due to the Ang-(1-9) formed.", 
    "501": "The present experimental study defines two novel inhibitory mechanisms of Ang II formation in the human heart interstitium. Heart chymase-mediated Ang II formation is strongly inhibited by the natural protease inhibitors present in the IF. Similarly, both heart ACE- and IF ACE-mediated Ang II formation appear to be inhibited by the endogenous inhibitor Ang-(1-9) formed by heart CPA-like activity. These inhibitory mechanisms provide additional information about how the Ang II concentration in the heart interstitium may be controlled.",

MC were incubated with enalaprilat (2.5-100 mumol/l) alone and together with combinations of H2O2 (3 daily pulses of 10(-6) mol/l), IL-6 (5 ng/ml) and PDGF (10 ng/ml). DNA synthesis was assessed after 72 h using [3H]thymidine (3H-TdR) incorporation. Enalaprilat alone had no effect on MC DNA synthesis. Stimulation of MC by H2O2, PDGF and IL-6 alone resulted in increases in 3H-TdR of 4936.6 +/- 1147.5, 5640.5 +/- 1537.6 and 4413.5 +/- 998.4 cpm, respectively (P < 0.05 above control). Only 2.5 mumol/l enalaprilat effected a significant reduction in IL-6 and PDGF-induced DNA synthesis. Incubation of MC with H2O2 + PDGF or H2O2 + IL-6 resulted in increases of 3H-TdR of 6471.9 +/- 1785.1 and 5507.2 +/- 1270 cpm, respectively (P < 0.05 above control). Addition of enalaprilat with either H2O2 + PDGF or H2O2 + IL-6 effected significant reductions in DNA synthesis over the range 2.5-100 mumol/l. These data demonstrate that ACE inhibitors modulate MC DNA synthesis induced by reactive oxygen species.",

All these changes were attenuated in both the captopril- and prazosin-treated groups. SOD, GSHPx and catalase activity in the untreated PMI groups was decreased at 4 and 16 weeks. However, treatment with captopril resulted in a significant improvement in SOD, GSHPx and catalase activity in the 16-week PMI group. With prazosin, only SOD activity was improved in the treated 16-week PMI group. Lipid peroxidation as indicated by TBARS was significantly increased in the 16-week PMI group, and both captopril and prazosin modulated this increase.",

The primary endpoint was the tolerability measure of a persisting increase in serum creatinine of 26.5 mumol/L or more (> or = 0.3 mg/dL) on therapy; the secondary endpoint was the composite of death and/or hospital admission for heart failure; and other efficacy measures were total mortality, admission for heart failure, NYHA class, and admission for myocardial infarction or unstable angina.",

Fewer losartan patients discontinued therapy for adverse experiences (12.2% vs 20.8% for captopril, p = 0.002). No losartan-treated patients discontinued due to cough compared with 14 in the captopril group. Death and/or hospital admission for heart failure was recorded in 9.4% of the losartan and 13.2% of the captopril patients (risk reduction 32% [95% CI -4% to + 55%], p = 0.075). This risk reduction was primarily due to a decrease in all-cause mortality (4.8% vs 8.7%; risk reduction 46% [95% CI 5-69%], p = 0.035). Admissions with heart failure were the same in both groups (5.7%), as was improvement in NYHA functional class from baseline. Admission to hospital for any reason was less frequent with losartan than with captopril treatment (22.2% vs 29.7%).", 
    "511": "In this study of elderly heart-failure patients, treatment with losartan was associated with an unexpected lower mortality than that found with captopril. Although there was no difference in renal dysfunction, losartan was generally better tolerated than captopril and fewer patients discontinued losartan therapy. A further trial, evaluating the effects of losartan and captopril on mortality and morbidity in a larger number of patients with heart failure, is in progress.", 
    "512": "The cardiovascular effects of a combination of trandolapril and verapamil were evaluated in 14 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. This combination therapy decreased arterial pressure mainly through a decrease in total peripheral resistance without causing an increase in heart rate or cardiac output: left ventricular mass was significantly reduced, cardiac systolic function improved, and plasma volume and renal blood flow remained unchanged.", 
    "513": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors improve survival in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) after an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), but mortality may be as high as 10% to 15% after 1 year. Verapamil prevents cardiac events after an AMI in patients without CHF. We hypothesized that in postinfarct patients with CHF already prescribed diuretics and an ACE inhibitor, additional treatment with verapamil may reduce cardiac event rate. In this multicenter, double-blind study, patients with CHF receiving diuretic treatment were consecutively randomized to treatment with trandolapril 1 mg/day for 1 month and 2 mg/day the following 2 months (n = 49), or to trandolapril as mentioned plus verapamil 240 mg/day for 1 month and 360 mg/day for 2 months (n = 51). Trial medication started 3 to 10 days after AMI. All patients were followed for 3 months. End points in the trandolapril/trandolapril-verapamil groups were death 1/1, reinfarction 7/1, unstable angina 9/3, and readmission for CHF 6/2. The 3-month first cardiac event rate was 35% in trandolapril-treated patients and 14% in trandolapril-verapamil-treated patients (hazard ratio 0.35, 95% confidence interval 0.15 to 0.85, p = 0.015). These data suggest that verapamil reduces cardiac event rates in post-AMI patients with CHF when added to an ACE inhibitor and a diuretic.", 
    "514": "Angiotensin converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibition reduces mortality among patients surviving an acute myocardial infarction, but whether to give ACE-inhibitors to all patients or target their use to selected patients is unclear. Seven thousand and one consecutive enzyme-confirmed myocardial infarctions were screened. One thousand seven hundred and forty-nine patients with echocardiographic signs of left ventricular dysfunction were randomized to oral trandolapril (876 patients) or placebo (873 patients) starting from days three to seven following the infarction. Average follow-up was 27 months. There were 304 deaths (34.7 percent) among patients on trandolapril vs. 369 deaths (42.3 percent) among patients on placebo (p = 0.0013). Relative risk (RR) of death in the trandolapril group was 0.78 (95% confidence interval (CD 0.67-0.91). Trandolapril reduced cardiovascular death (RR 0.75, CI 0.63-0.89) and sudden death (RR 0.76, CI 0.59-0.98). Progression to severe/resistant heart failure was reduced (RR 0.71, CI 0.56-0.90). Recurrent myocardial infarction (fatal or non-fatal) was not significantly reduced (RR 0.86, CI 0.66-1.13). It is concluded that long-term treatment with trandolapril in patients with reduced left ventricular function shortly after myocardial infarction significantly reduced total mortality. The substantial mortality risk reduction was obtained in 25% of consecutive patients screened for entry encouraging a selective use of ACE inhibition following myocardial infarction.", 
    "515": "It has for years been a matter of debate whether digoxin may/should be used in chronic heart failure with sinus rhythm. Interest in digoxin was renewed when it was found that the substance had a vagotonic as well as a sympatholytic effect in heart failure patients. A recent clinical trial led to the conclusion that although digoxin had no effect on the mortality among heart failure patients, it did lead to a reduction of the number of hospital admissions, particularly because of heart failure (indicating reduced morbidity and deceleration of the progression of the disease). Many heart failure patients continue to have symptoms in spite of treatment with diuretics and ACE inhibitors. As only few alternatives are available, many physicians in the near future will go on using digoxin in these patients- and as the recent study shows, rightly so.", 
    "516": "Associations between coronary events and plasma renin activity, and between coronary risk reduction and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, are now well recognized. Improvement in endothelial function may explain, in part, some of the effects of ACE inhibitors in reducing the rates of adverse cardiovascular outcomes observed in clinical trials. ACE inhibitors have been shown to restore the endothelium-mediated vascular relaxation response in animal models of severe atherosclerosis. Clinical trials are now under way to examine the effect of ACE inhibitors on surrogate outcomes that allow assessment of endothelial function in the progression of carotid and coronary atherosclerosis. The recently completed Trial on Reversing ENdothelial Dysfunction (TREND) demonstrated improved coronary endothelium-dependent vasomotor function after 6 months of treatment with quinapril. In addition, quinapril treatment was associated with a trend toward an increase in microvascular blood flow response. Other studies in progress will assess the effect of ACE inhibitors on clinical coronary risk and plaque progression.", 
    "517": "New evidence suggests an interaction between hyperlipidemia, activation of the renin-angiotensin system, and atherosclerotic disease. In patients with atherosclerosis and hyperlipidemia, coronary endothelial dysfunction is usually diffuse and affects vasomotor tone, platelet activity, thrombosis, fibrinolysis, and regulation of inflammatory cells. Angiotensin II, an important oxidant, alters the binding of low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol to its receptors and increases endothelial uptake of LDL. Endothelial dysfunction is worsened by the suppression of nitric oxide production and/or release via angiotensin II-associated degradation of bradykinin and oxygen free radical production, resulting in inadequate vasorelaxation. Therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors appears to eliminate these untoward effects and may ameliorate the tendency for myocardial infarction associated with elevated plasma levels of angiotensin II. Although the role of ACE inhibitors in the prevention and/or treatment of coronary artery disease in patients without left ventricular dysfunction remains to be established, the capacity of ACE inhibition to correct endothelial dysfunction offers promise. The ability of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors to improve endothelial function, prevent the progression of coronary atherosclerosis, reduce the incidence of ischemic events, and improve survival is well known. Potentially, ACE inhibitors may have an additive or synergistic effect on the development of atherosclerosis and the clinical consequences of this disease when used in combination therapy with lipid-lowering strategies.", 
    "518": "In addition to causing vasoconstriction and the retention of salt and water, angiotensin inhibits fibrinolysis, thereby promoting clot formation and protecting against hemorrhage. Activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) can disturb the balance of the fibrinolytic system by stimulating excess production of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) and increasing the risk of thrombotic events. This risk is exacerbated by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-induced degradation of bradykinin, which normally stimulates production of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA). Modification of the RAS via ACE inhibition may protect against thrombosis by limiting vascular expression of PAI-1 and augmenting bradykinin-induced production of t-PA. Survivors of myocardial infarction treated with an ACE inhibitor have demonstrated a reduction in PAI-1 activity and preservation of the normal ratio of PAI-1 to t-PA. This effect on the fibrinolytic system may contribute to the favorable impact ACE inhibition has been demonstrated to have on the incidence of recurrent myocardial infarction.", 
    "519": "In recent years, a prodigious amount of information has been gathered regarding the relationship between vascular biology and the mechanisms underlying cardiovascular disease. Activation of elements of the reninangiotensin system (RAS) appear to play an important role in the development and progression of conditions such as hypertension, coronary artery disease, and heart failure. Indeed, converging lines of evidence indicate that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) regulates a delicate balance among a multitude of factors responsible for vascular tone, cellular growth promotion and inhibition, and pro- and anti-inflammatory effects. Because angiotensin II inhibits fibronectin, stimulates expression of plasminogen activator inhibitors, and degrades bradykinin, thereby impairing production of nitric oxide, ACE and the RAS are also involved in thrombosis and fibrinolysis. The favorable effects of ACE inhibition on endothelial function and, potentially, on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are believed to result not only from angiotensin II suppression but also its consequent bradykinin preservation and nitric oxide production.",

    "523": "Diuretics and beta-blockers have been evaluated in 18 long-term randomized trials. Compared with placebo, beta-blocker therapy was effective in preventing stroke (relative risk [RR], 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.59-0.86) and congestive heart failure (RR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.40-0.84). The findings were similar for high-dose diuretic therapy (for stroke, RR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.39-0.62; and for congestive heart failure, RR, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.07-0.41). Low-dose diuretic therapy prevented not only stroke (RR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.55-0.78) and congestive heart failure (RR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.44-0.76) but also coronary disease (RR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.61-0.85) and total mortality (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.81-0.99). Although calcium channel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduce blood pressure in hypertensive patients, the clinical trial evidence in terms of health outcomes is meager. For several short-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, the available evidence suggests the possibility of harm. Whether the long-acting formulations and the nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are safe and prevent major cardiovascular events in patients with hypertension remains untested and therefore unknown.", 
    "524": "Until the results of large long-term clinical trials evaluating the effects of calcium channel blockers and ACE inhibitors on cardiovascular disease incidence are completed, the available scientific evidence provides strong support for the current national guidelines, which recommend diuretics and beta-blockers as firstline agents and low-dose therapy for all antihypertensive agents.",

    "526": "Survival was improved by early treatment at 3 months (from 76% to 95%) and by both early and delayed treatment at 9 months (placebo, 28%; early, 90%; delayed, 61%). Delayed treatment was initiated in a more severe pathophysiological context of CHF than early treatment, illustrated in untreated rats by higher left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic and central venous pressures and by increased LV weight and LV cavity circumference. After 9 months, early and delayed treatments reduced systolic, LV end-diastolic, and central venous pressures. Both treatments also similarly decreased LV weight, LV cavity circumference, and LV collagen density.", 
    "527": "In this rat model of CHF, early and delayed ACE inhibitor treatments both increase survival and exert similar beneficial effects on cardiac hemodynamics and remodeling. Although early treatment prevents the development of ventricular dysfunction and remodeling, delayed treatment is capable of reversing cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling, as well as ventricular dysfunction. Thus, ACE inhibitors exert marked beneficial effects even when treatment is initiated late into the evolution of heart failure (ie, at a time of established ventricular dysfunction and remodeling).",

Patients were categorized, according to changes in MFVP, into four groups: 61 patients with an irreversible restrictive, 37 with a reversible restrictive, 48 patients with a stable nonrestrictive, and 27 patients with an unstable nonrestrictive MFVP. Fifty patients experienced major cardiac events. Cox analysis revealed that MFVP was a strong predictor of events and that the response to loading manipulations improved its prognostic value. Patients with an irreversible restrictive MFVP had a higher event rate (51%) than patients with a reversible restrictive MFVP (19%). Among patients with a baseline nonrestrictive MFVP, those with a stable nonrestrictive MFVP had the lowest event rate (6%), whereas the event rate was 33% in patients with an unstable nonrestrictive MFVP.",

Neither icatibant nor quinaprilat affected arterial diameter or blood flow at rest. However, icatibant reduced flow-dependent dilation by 33%, and quinaprilat increased flow-dependent dilation over baseline by 46%.

In infarctions < 40% of the left ventricle (LV), the RVW/BW relation was S = L < NT (p < 0.05); the left ventricular systolic pressure was S > L > NT (p < 0.05). In infarctions > 40% of LV, the RVW/BW relation was S < L = NT (p < 0.05). For the Starling curves, the results were S > L > NT (p < 0.05).", 
    "547": "In our model lisinopril did not interfere with post-infarction mortality of rats, although decreasing the mortality risk in 49%, in the treated group. The drug also altered the remodeling process, preventing hypertrophy and systolic disfunction after MI, mainly in infarctions < 40% of LV.", 
    "548": "Overall fifty one patients with chronic cardiac insufficiency (ChCI) were studied for changes in parameters characterizing hemodynamics and lipid peroxidation (LPO) under treatment with kapoten and prazosin. Kapoten was found to be capable of exerting an antioxidant effect and working in ways beneficial for the pulmonary circulation, while prazosin is generally indicated to patients with ChCI presenting with increased end diastolic pressure in the left ventricle. Prazosin activates LPO, for which reason its pro-oxidant action needs to be drug-corrected. Because of marked pharmacologic effects of both drugs in dealing with refractory circulatory insufficiency it is advisable that further studies be made in order that we might be able to determine indications for kapoten and prazosin therapy in coronary patients as well as those with arterial hypertension, cardiomyopathies, valvular defects, ChCI with complications more accurately.", 
    "549": "Soluble and membrane forms of angiotensin-converting enzyme were purified by cascade affinity chromatography. The enzyme forms were completely separated from each other using their different affinity to the hydrophobic matrix phenyl-silochrome. The enzymes was further purified on affinity sorbent prepared by immobilization of the enzyme inhibitor N-[1(S)-carboxy-5-aminopentyl]glycylphenylalanine on agarose. The procedure yielded electrophoretically homogeneous soluble and membrane forms of angiotensin-converting enzyme containing only active molecules as demonstrated by titration with the reversible inhibitor lisinopril. According to phase separation in the presence of Triton X-114, the membrane enzyme is more hydrophobic than the soluble form. The catalytic characteristics of the enzyme forms differed from each other in the system Aerosol OT-water-octane (reversed micelles) which is model for the membrane environment of the enzymes in vivo.", 
    "550": "The effect of N(alpha)-carboxyalkylated dipeptides on angiotensin-converting and kinin-degrading activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase) was studied. These inhibitors selectively affected ACE-induced hydrolysis of angiotensin I-like and bradykinin-like (hippuryl-His-Leu and hippuryl-Phe-Arg, respectively) substrates in microsomal fractions of rat lungs and kidneys and rat blood serum. The inhibition constants of both types of activity were determined for these enzyme preparations and also for ACE from porcine seminal fluid and highly purified ACE from porcine lung. In all cases high inhibition selectivity of angiotensin-generating and kininase activities of ACE was found.", 
    "551": "One hundred and twenty two patients who were presenting with chronic persistent cough for more than 3-4 weeks were studied. Using anatomical and stepwise approach, we could identify the cause of chronic cough in 96% of the patients. The most common causes were due to postnasal drip syndrome (PND) (45%) and bronchial asthma (26%). We also demonstrated the important role of methacholine inhalation challenge in the diagnostic work up. The procedure could identify the patients who had bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) in 52% of the cases. The severity degree of the BHR was classified into three levels. Mild or nonspecific BHR was defined as PC20 16-25 mg/ml. This could be found in many diseases such as PND and bronchiectasis. Moderate degree of BHR (PC20 8-16 mg/ml) was found in patients with PND and asthma. PC20 of less than 8 mg/ml was considered to be the most severe degree and it seemed to be specific for the diagnosis of asthma (positive predictive value 100%). Other condition that caused chronic cough were drug-induced, especially angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, subgottic cancer and idiopathic cough. These conditions may require invasive diagnostic work up, such as fiberoptic bronchoscopy and tissue biopsy. The treatment of chronic cough was according to the etiology. Thus, the patients presenting with chronic cough should be investigated to identify the cause, and it was not just only the administration of cough suppressant drugs in these patients.", 
    "552": "EFFECTS OF VERAPAMIL AND TRANDOLAPRIL: Progression of heart failure, sudden death and death from re-infarction are the major cause of the increased mortality in postinfarct patients with congestive heart failure. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors such as trandolapril can prevent the progression of heart failure and thus improve survival. The calcium antagonist verapamil has been shown to prevent sudden death and re-infarction in postinfarct patients without congestive heart failure.", 
    "553": "The Danish Verapamil Infarction Trial (DAVIT) study group hypothesized the combined treatment with trandolapril and verapamil might prevent cardiac events in postinfarct patients with coronary heart disease. The first double-blind randomized trial included 100 patients and supported this hypothesis, as the cardiac event rate was significantly lower after 3 months in patients treated with the combination than in those treated with trandolapril alone (14 versus 35%, respectively; P = 0.01, hazard ratio 0.35, 95% confidence interval 0.15-0.85).", 
    "554": "MECHANISMS OF ACTION IN SMOOTH MUSCLE: Calcium antagonists and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors act synergistically in reducing blood pressure. Calcium antagonists counter an excess of calcium entry through the voltage-operated channels of the vascular smooth muscle. ACE inhibitors reduce the vasoconstrictive properties of local and circulating angiotensin II. In addition, they improve endothelium-dependent vasodilation by increasing the expression of endothelial inositol by a bradykinin-related mechanism. Thus, at the smooth muscle level, calcium antagonists cause dilation by reducing external calcium entry and ACE inhibitors cause dilation by reducing internal calcium cycling and improving nitric oxide production.", 
    "555": "The two agents have synergistic antagonists exert a potent cardioprotective action; this effect requires prophylactic administration and relies on the ATP-sparing capacity of these drugs. Moreover, prophylactic administration of verapamil but not to other calcium antagonists in patients who have suffered an acute myocardial infarction reduces overall mortality, provided no overt heart failure is present. The molecular effect of ACE inhibitors on the ischaemic heart is less well known but seems to be related to a reduction in noradrenaline release or to an improvement in bradykinin; the effect is thus complementary to that of calcium antagonists.", 
    "556": "There is evidence that ACE inhibitors may have additional cardioprotective properties in being able to improve coronary flow, prevent arrhythmias, reduce the toxicity of oxygen free radicals, improve myocardial energy metabolism and prevent remodelling of the heart. ACE inhibitors can also protect the ischaemic heart by inhibiting bradykinin breakdown and by interfering with the central and peripheral nervous and hormone systems such as the kallikrein-kinin, prostaglandin and sympathetic nervous systems. The administration of ACE inhibitors to patients with acute myocardial infarction failed to reduce mortality. However, prophylactic administration to patients with myocardial infarction and heart failure resulted in a significant reduction in mortality and in hospitalization for cardiac disease.", 
    "557": "The combination of verapamil with an ACE inhibitor is promising not only for the treatment of hypertension, but also for ischaemic heart disease.", 
    "558": "EFFECTS OF HYPERTENSION ON LARGE ARTERIES: The mechanical properties of large arteries make a major contribution to cardiovascular haemodynamics through the buffering of stroke volume and by propagation of the pressure pulse. A sustained increase in blood pressure often leads to stiffness of the large arteries, especially when other risk factors are present. The increased stiffness, in turn, aggravates hypertension by increasing systolic blood pressure and can induce cardiac hypertrophy and arterial lesions. Epidemiological studies strongly suggest that subjects with stiffer arteries have a high pulse pressure, and that stiffening of large arteries is associated with excess morbidity and mortality independently of other cardiovascular risk factors. ENVIRONMENTAL AND GENETIC FACTORS: Apart from high blood pressure and ageing, various environmental and genetic factors that influence the composition of the extracellular matrix of the arterial wall can increase arterial stiffness. Clinical studies suggest that the presence of some genotypes may be a particularly important risk marker for arterial stiffness, and may modulate the effects of hypertension, ageing and lipids on large arteries. EFFECTS OF ANTIHYPERTENSIVE DRUGS: The development of accurate, non-invasive methods has now made it possible to detect alterations of the large arteries. Among antihypertensive drugs, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium channel blockers have proved to be highly effective in improving large artery compliance, and have shown no adverse effects on metabolic factors that can alter arterial structure and function such as lipids, plasma glucose and insulin tolerance. Therefore these drugs may be particularly suitable for treating patients with increased arterial stiffness. Finally, a determination of genotypes may be helpful in the future in choosing antihypertensive therapy.", 
    "559": "Hypertension occurs about twice as frequently in diabetics compared with the general population, with a prevalence of approximately 25% in young patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and 50% in newly diagnosed non-IDDM (NIDDM) patients. Studies strongly suggest that hypertensions is involved in the progression and perhaps the onset of diabetic nephropathy, which is a major cause of illness and premature death in diabetic patients, largely through accompanying cardiovascular disease and end-stage renal failure.", 
    "560": "A large body of evidence has accumulated which emphasizes the beneficial effects of antihypertensive treatment in reducing proteinuria and preserving renal function in both IDDM and NIDDM. It appears that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and certain calcium antagonists, notably the non-dihydropyridine type and second-generation dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, produce a more beneficial effect on nephropathy in terms of reducing proteinuria and slowing progression in renal failure. These drugs have displayed a nephroprotective capacity beyond their systemic blood pressure-lowering effects, and initial clinical trials with combinations of different antihypertensive drug classes have revealed additive effects in reducing albuminuria together with the lowest rate of decline in glomerular filtration rates with the lowest incidence of adverse effects.", 
    "561": "The studies available on antihypertensive treatment in IDDM and NIDDM patients with incipient or overt diabetic nephropathy are mainly prospective. There have also been some preliminary trials with antihypertensive combinations in diabetic patients.", 
    "562": "The prevalence of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus-associated nephropathy is increasing worldwide. Obviously, a greater commitment of time is required from health providers to care for such patients. Moreover, when these patients develop end-stage renal disease, healthcare costs increase geometrically when viewed in the total context of lost wages and increased health-care expenditures.", 
    "563": "Strict control of glucose as well as a low-protein and low-salt diet are important, but ultimately, aggressive blood pressure reduction is required to markedly decrease the time to dialysis.", 
    "564": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors should be part of the blood pressure-lowering therapy in all such patients. Recent data support the concept that addition of an ACE inhibitor to other blood pressure-lowering regimens delays the time to dialysis. Moreover, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers should also be added for blood pressure control in these patients.", 
    "565": "Recent evidence from long-term studies in patients with nephropathy from non-insulin-dependent diabetes suggest that this subclass of calcium blockers is similar in efficacy to ACE inhibitors.", 
    "566": "The use of these strategies to reduce arterial systolic/diastolic pressure to < 130/80 mmHg will provide long-term benefit both to the patient and to society.", 
    "567": "AIM OF ANTIHYPERTENSIVE TREATMENT IN DIABETICS: Prevention or treatment of hypertensive in diabetic patients reduces the incidence and progression of diabetic complications of retinopathy and nephropathy, cerebro- and cardio-vascular disease, and widespread macroangiopathy. Therefore, in patients with diabetes and hypertension beside good glucose control, the basic and probably major intervention steps is to normalize blood pressure. Antihypertensive treatment usually means life-long use of antihypertensive drugs. METABOLIC EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT DRUG CLASSES: Given the known diabetogenic properties of several antihypertensive drugs and their high rate of use, in probably a substantial proportion of patients with diabetes or prone to develop diabetes, treating arterial hypertension with conventional diuretics and/or beta-blockers might, in the long term, offset the beneficial effects of lowering blood pressure. Furthermore, there are conflicting reports of increased mortality in patients treated with diuretics, beta-blockers or calcium antagonists. Consequently, metabolic aspects and side effects of antihypertensive drugs are key elements in determining the preference for a specific antihypertensive regimen. Although the impact of hyperinsulinemia/insulin resistance on morbidity and mortality is an open question, it is preferable that antihypertensive treatment does not increase insulin resistance and/or hyperinsulinemia. Chronic beta-blocker treatment can be accompanied by an increase in insulin resistance. Calcium antagonists and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and alpha(1)-blockers are neutral or might even improve insulin resistance and lipid profile. Thiazides impair glucose tolerance, increase low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and decrease potassium, although these side effects are dose-dependent. Unless diuretics are needed for reasons other than hypertension, treatment of diabetics with thiazides should be avoided until the influence of these agents on prognosis is clarified. If the addition of a diuretic is needed, the metabolically neutral indapamide would seem a reasonable choice. PREFERRED FIRST-LINE TREATMENT: On the basis of favorable pharmacological profiles, ACE inhibitors and certain calcium antagonists have emerged as the preferred first-line drugs in the treatment of the hypertensive diabetic patient. In diabetics with nephropathy, therapy is usually initiated with an ACE inhibitor. Moreover, the combination of an ACE inhibitor and a calcium antagonist that lowers the heart rate (such as verapamil) might offer even greater advantages than either class of drug alone, since they combine metabolic neutrality with added antihypertensive and renal protective efficacy.", 
    "568": "ADVANTAGES OF DRUG COMBINATIONS: The particular advantage usually sought with antihypertensive drug combinations is an improvement in blood pressure control. However, at least as important is a consideration of adverse reactions and the safety of the combination compared to monotherapy.", 
    "569": "The fixed-dose combination of the calcium antagonist verapamil and the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor trandolapril consists of a sustained-release (SR) tablet formulation of verapamil, and an instant-release granulation of trandolapril, a prodrug of the active metabolite trandolaprilat. The two drugs are suitable for combined administration since the half-life, time to maximal plasma concentration and peak: trough ratio are very similar for each drug.", 
    "570": "In randomized placebo-controlled studies adverse events were observed in 25.6% of patients on placebo, 34.2% on verapamil SR, 27.3% on trandolapril and 27.9% on the combination of 180 mg verapamil + 2 mg trandolapril per day. Constipation and cough, which are considered to be specific adverse effects, occurred in 3.4% and 2.4% of patients on monotherapy with verapamil and trandolapril, respectively, but in only 2.9% and 1.9% of patients on combination therapy, respectively. Electrocardiograph recordings have not shown a prolongation of the P-Q interval to > 200 ms (placebo 1.1%, verapamil 1.2%, trandolapril 1,8%, combination 1.2%). No specific changes were found in the laboratory parameters.", 
    "571": "In summary, the profile of adverse drug reactions of a fixed-dose combination of verapamil and trandolapril consists the typical side effects of the monocompounds. The frequencies of adverse events were equal to or even lower than those for the monocompounds or of placebo.", 
    "572": "To review the possibilities of combination treatment in hypertension with special emphasis on the combination of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and a calcium channel blocker.", 
    "573": "An increasing number of combination of drugs has become available. Fixed combinations, often low-dose, have proved suitable for the treatment of hypertension, even as first-line therapy.", 
    "574": "A fixed combination of an ACE inhibitor and a calcium channel blocker, in particular the combination of trandolapril and verapamil, is a suitable alternative to existing treatment modalities.", 
    "575": "REQUIREMENTS FOR DRUG REGISTRATION: Current drug registration procedures by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) require at least two placebo-controlled factorial- and/or parallel-study designs. The statistical and graphical analysis of a factorial-design study allows the investigator to identify the optimal dose of the combination but these comparisons require considerable overall patient numbers for statistical power. In contrast, parallel-design studies require about 150 matched patients in each of the four arms.", 
    "576": "In an effect to compare combination studies across antihypertensive drug classes, we examined data from studies that formed the basic of past registration applications to the FDA. Our review findings indicated that combined antihypertensive effects were, at best, approximately additive for a number of different combinations. However, this takes no account of the advantages of drug combinations in allowing reduced dosages of each drug with fewer adverse effects than monotherapy.", 
    "577": "In the case of calcium antagonists, physicians must differentiate between rapid-onset or short-acting dihydropyridines, which raise the heart rate and plasma noradrenaline, and longer-acting newer calcium antagonists. Recent evidence indicates that the combination of a long-acting calcium antagonist and an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor is particularly effective in reducing cardiovascular risk.", 
    "578": "Combining drugs with different mechanisms of action seems to be a reasonable and effective way of treating hypertension. It is essential, however, to establish the efficacy and safety of all new drug combinations by performing carefully designed clinical studies that fulfill the stringent FDA requirements.", 
    "579": "Preclinical studies were designed to investigate whether the combination of verapamil and trandolapril was more potent than either drug alone for the treatment of hypertension and concomitant cardiovascular or metabolic diseases.", 
    "580": "In spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) oral treatment with the combination of verapamil plus trandolapril not only significantly reduced elevated blood pressure for 24 h but, after terminating treatment, the antihypertensive effect lasted longer than 48 h, indicating potentiation of each compound's effect. In stroke-prone SHR, life-long oral treatment with low doses of verapamil, trandolapril or their combination significantly prolonged life in each case, but results obtained with the combination were additive compared with monotherapy.", 
    "581": "In an animal model of non-insulin-dependent diabetes, the obese Zucker rat, 2 weeks oral treatment with verapamil, trandolapril or both combined significantly improved leukocyte rheology, but only the combination treatment normalized the microcirculation. In insulin-dependent diabetes (streptozotocin-induced) in SHR, oral treatment with the combination for 12 weeks additively reduced blood pressure and totally normalized proteinuria and albuminuria. Verapamil was least effective. Trandolapril showed intermediate protection against insulin-dependent diabetes-related renal failure.", 
    "582": "In SHR, almost in parallel with the progression of hypertension, progressive renal failure develops, as indicated by increasing proteinuria and albuminuria. With lifelong treatment in these rats, verapamil + trandolapril combined inhibited the progression towards end-stage renal failure more effectively than either compound used as monotherapy and also significantly prolonged survival. In a second study, in older rats with hypertension and proteinuria, chronic treatment with the combination reduced renal insufficiency in parallel with a reduction in glomerulosclerosis independently of a blood pressure reduction and significantly more potently than each drug alone.", 
    "583": "In pigs subjected to consecutive left anterior descending artery occlusions, intravenous verapamil dose-dependently reduced ischaemic myocardial K+ loss. Trandolapril alone was ineffective. Combining two ineffective doses (0.02 mg/kg verapamil plus 0.1 mg/kg trandolapril) led to a significant, additive reduction in extracellular K+ concentrations during ischaemia. Combined intracoronary application of 0.5 mg/kg trandolapril and 0.1 mg/kg verapamil before occlusion in dogs improved myocardial contractility 3 h after reperfusion to a greater extent than monotherapy and reduced the incidence of reperfusion arrhythmias. In dogs exposed to hypoxaemia after ischaemic reperfusion injury, paradoxical coronary constriction was observed. Treatment with trandolapril (0.05 mg/kg) plus verapamil (0.1 mg/kg) inhibited this vasoconstriction in response to repeated hypoxia. In anaesthetized dogs, cyclic coronary flow reductions were induced. Trandolapril reduced these by 70-80% from a dose of 0.1 mg/kg onwards. Verapamil (0.2 mg/kg) had no effect. Combining ineffective doses of trandolapril (0.05 mg/kg) and verapamil (0.1 mg/kg) led to a 70% fall in the flow reductions. Further experiments using either the bradykinin B2 antagonist HOE 140 or the angiotensin II AT1-receptor antagonist Exp 3174 showed that this effect was not mediated by increases in bradykinin levels but by a decrease in angiotensin II.", 
    "584": "Two weeks after occlusion of the left anterior descending artery, surviving rats were randomly allocated to no treatment or to verapamil at 20 or 40 mg/kg per day or to trandolapril at 0.3 or 0.7 mg/kg per day or to combinations of both drugs, orally for 24 weeks. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)", 
    "585": "Glomerular diseases may progress to end-stage renal failure via the development of glomerulosclerosis. Systemic hypertension and intraglomerular hypertension are important, although not the only, determinants of this process. Proteinuria (albuminuria) is a surrogate marker for glomerular damage and renal prognosis.", 
    "586": "In animal experiments and in controlled clinical studies, ACE inhibitors have proved to be effective in reducing proteinuria and in preventing glomerulosclerosis or progression to end-stage renal failure, possibly more than can be explained by their effects on blood pressure.", 
    "587": "In contrast to the uniform efficacy of ACE inhibitors, the effect of calcium channel blockers is less uniform. It depends on the model of renal damage used, the extent of the fall in systemic blood pressure and the type of calcium channel blocker used. Nevertheless, clinical studies have shown a reduction in proteinuria and at least an attenuation of progression with the use of long-acting calcium channel blockers.", 
    "588": "If angiotensin II influences the progression of renal failure, as is universally accepted, then the combination of an ACE inhibitor (reducing the generation of angiotensin II) and a calcium channel blocker (reducing target-organ responsiveness to angiotensin II) appears a promising one.", 
    "589": "In animal experiments, co-administration of an ACE inhibitor and a calcium channel blocker caused a more marked reduction in glomerulosclerosis, and this was seen in the stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rat model even at non-antihypertensive doses. In human diabetic nephropathy at least, proteinuria (measured as a surrogate marker of the illness) was lowered more effectively by the combination of an ACE inhibitor and a calcium channel blocker than either drug used as monotherapy despite a similar fall in blood pressure.", 
    "590": "Pharmacological intervention studies aimed at lowering elevated blood pressure have shown that stroke, and to a lesser degree coronary heart disease, morbidity and mortality are positively affected. These beneficial effects appear to have been obtained mainly with diuretics and beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents, as shown in a meta-analysis of 13 large prospective intervention trials in hypertension.", 
    "591": "Benefits of pharmacological antihypertensive treatment were observed in the treatment of patients with malignant hypertension in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Many of these studies were conducted before diuretics became clinically available and long before the first reports of the antihypertensive effect of beta-blockers were published.", 
    "592": "Prospective intervention trials with newer antihypertensive agents such as calcium antagonists and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are currently in progress. Three recently, open, retrospective case-control studies dealing with comparisons of various antihypertensive drug classes with regard to their effect on cardiovascular mortality have attracted interest.", 
    "593": "Another question of considerable clinical importance is how far blood pressure should be lowered in order to extract the maximum benefit of treatment. This issue is currently being investigated.", 
    "594": "The purpose of the study was to evalute the impact of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) system on blood pressure (BP) response in patients with hypertensive emergencies and urgencies treated with intravenous enalaprilat. Thirty-five patients with a systolic BP (SBP) >210 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP (DBP) >110 mm Hg received 5 mg enalaprilat intravenously. The extent of systolic and DBP reduction was correlated with pretreatment concentrations of angiotensin II (ANGII) (SBP: r = -0.47; P = 0.006; DBP: r = -0.55; P = 0.001) and plasma renin activity (PRA) (SBP: r = -0.49; P = 0.003; DBP: r = 0.48; P = 0.007). Non-responders to enalaprilat exhibited significant lower pretreatment levels of PRA, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and ANG II compared to responders (PRA: 5.5 +/- 3.7 vs 1.1 +/- 2.2 ng/ml/h, P < 0.001; ACE: 12.8 +/- 3.5 vs 8.2 +/- 4.8 U/l, P = 0.003; ANG 11:8.7 +/- 6.2 vs 5.0 +/- 3.8 pg/ml, P = 0.04). In patients with severe hypotension following application of enalaprilat ANG II concentrations were significantly higher compared to patients with mean arterial BP reduction <25% (12.3 +/- 6.7 vs 5.6 +/- 4.0 pg/ml,P = 0.013). These data indicate that PRA and ANG II are the major determinants for BP response to enalaprilat. This relation between BP response and RAA system activity have important clinical implications for the treatment of patients with severe hypertension. Primary therapeutic failure indicates that the RAA system contributes very little to the hypertensive status of the patient. Thus, repetitive application on an ACE inhibitor in primary responders is clinically unhelpful and may result in an unnecessary delay of an effective BP reduction. In contrast, high ANG II concentrations are associated with a considerable risk for severe hypotension after enolanalaprilat application. Therefore, the status of the RAA system determines the efficacy as well as the safety of ACE inhibitor treatment in patients with severe hypertension.", 
    "595": "Attainment of the regression of hypertension-associated left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) seems to be a desirable goal of blood pressure (BP)-reducing therapy. Since antihypertensive drugs of differing types may exhibit markedly different abilities to modulate LVH, we examined the effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor cilazapril, and the potassium channel activator minoxidil, alone or in combination with each other, on the left ventricular mass (LVM) in patients with severe essential hypertension who had LVH detected by echocardiography. All patients received the same base therapy of bopindolol and guanfacine. After a run-in period, they were treated with: (1) cilazapril (n = 10); (2) minoxidil, combined with a diuretic (n = 10); or (3) both cilazapril and monoxidil (n = 6) for 12 months. The LVM index (LVMI; LVM per body surface area) was estimated every 3 months by means of echocardiography. Each kind of therapy decreased the arterial pressures to a similar degree. The 1-year treatment with the cilazapril-based regimen resulted in a significantly diminished LVMI (from a mean +/- s.d. of 173 +/- 38 to 152 +/- 22 g/m2; P < 0.05). On the other hand, the minoxidil-based therapy led to a significant increase in LVMI (from 148 +/- 19 to 170 +/- 35 g/m2; P < 0.05). There were no significant LVMI changes in patients receiving the combined, cilazapril + minoxidil-based treatment (172 +/- 34 vs the pretreatment 183 +/- 54 g/m2). The results confirm that long-term treatment with cilazapril is effective both in reducing BP and in reducing LVM. In spite of yielding a satisfactory reduction of BP, minoxidil therapy, even in combination with a diuretic and a beta-blocker, may lead to an aggravation of pre-existing LVH; this effect of minoxidil could be prevented by the simultaneous administration of cilazapril.", 
    "596": "Alterations in the structure of resistance and conduit arteries are a characteristic hallmark in hypertension. Studies carried out in hypertensive rats and in humans suggest that angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibition has an effect on arterial structure of resistance arteries. In hypertensive rats the reduction of the media to lumen ratio is dose-dependent and significantly different from the effects of other antihypertensive agents at doses causing an equal degree of blood pressure reduction. In large conduit arteries, hypertrophy of the vessels is reversed by converting enzyme inhibition both in hypertensive rats (studies on central arteries) and in human (studies on peripheral arteries) hypertension. The reduction of hypertrophy is associated with a decrease in arterial stiffness, partly independent of blood pressure reduction. These findings suggest that regression of structural vascular changes may contribute to both the decrease in the arteriolar resistance and the improvement in the buffering function of large arteries. The decrease in arteriolar resistance and the improvement of large artery compliance may participate in blood pressure reduction and an improvement in pulse pressure amplification produced by converting enzyme inhibition.", 
    "597": "It is not yet known if the alterations in myocardial glucose metabolism and the exaggerated left ventricular dysfunction that occur during reperfusion in hypertrophied hearts are reversible. Thus, we studied isolated working hearts from aortic-banded (n = 29) and sham-operated control (n = 32) male Sprague-Dawley rats with or without enalapril maleate treatment (25.6 +/- 0.8 mg/kg per day, p.o.) to determine the effect of regression of cardiac hypertrophy on myocardial glucose metabolism and post-ischemic heart function. Hearts were perfused with buffer containing 1.2 mM palmitate, 11 mM [5-3H]/[U-14C]-glucose, 0.5 mM lactate and 100 microU/ml insulin. Glucose metabolism [rates of glycolysis (3H2O production) and rates of oxidation (14CO2 production) of exogenous glucose] and heart function (heart rate x peak systolic pressure) were measured during 30 min pre-ischemic perfusion and 60 min of reperfusion following 20 min of global, no-flow ischemia. Hearts from untreated aortic-banded rats were hypertrophied, being 27.6 +/- 1.8% larger than hearts from untreated control rats. Enalapril treatment caused regression of cardiac hypertrophy that normalized heart weight in aortic-banded rats. Rates of glycolysis of exogenous glucose in hearts from untreated aortic-banded rats were accelerated compared to rates in hearts from untreated control rats during pre-ischemic perfusion (4391 +/- 97 v 2652 +/- 69 nmol glucose/min per g dry wt, respectively, P < 0.05) and reperfusion (2402 +/- 58 v 1597 +/- 88 nmol glucose/min per g dry wt. respectively, P < 0.05). In contrast, rates of glycolysis of exogenous glucose in hearts from enalapril-treated aortic-banded rats were normalized before and after ischemia. Rates of glycolysis of exogenous glucose in hearts of control rats were not affected by enalapril treatment. Oxidation of exogenous glucose was not different among groups either before or after ischemia. Function of hearts from untreated aortic-banded rats at the end of reperfusion was significantly less than that of hearts from untreated control rats (23.9 +/- 2.6 v 32.2 +/- 0.7 mmHg x beats per min/1000, respectively, P < 0.05). As with myocardial glucose metabolism function of hearts from aortic-banded rats treated with enalapril was normalized during reperfusion. Thus, pharmacologically induced regression of pressure-overload cardiac hypertrophy normalizes glucose metabolism as well as left ventricular function during reperfusion.", 
    "598": "The effect of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, on Na+/H(+)-exchange activity and on Ca(2+)-ATPase mediated Ca(2+)-efflux was investigated in red blood cell membranes of patients with essential hypertension. The erythrocyte Na+/H(+)-exchange rate was measured as the difference in H(+)-efflux rate when measured in the presence or absence of Na+. The erythrocyte Ca(2+)-transport mediated by Ca(2+)-ATPase was assayed as the erythrocyte Ca(2+)-efflux rate. Our data show that captopril, in vitro and in vivo, inhibits the Ca(2+)-ATPase mediated Ca(2+)-efflux rate in human erythrocytes, while in vivo it stimulates the erythrocytes Na+/H(+)-exchange rate.", 
    "599": "The negative charges of dextran-sulfate (DS) used for low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) apheresis initiate the intrinsic coagulation pathway in which plasma kallikrein acts on the high-molecular-weight kininogen to produce large amounts of bradykinin. This study was undertaken to assess whether bradykinin generated during DS LDL apheresis has any physiologic effects in vivo. The plasma levels of bradykinin, prostaglandins and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) were compared. when either of two anticoagulants, heparin or nafamostat mesilate (NM), was used during DS LDL apheresis. Although anticoagulative action by NM depends on the inhibition of thrombin activity this substance also inhibits the activity of plasma kallikrein. During apheresis using heparin, the plasma levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) increased significantly (5.6 +/- 1.2 (mean +/- SE, n = 4) pg/ml before apheresis and 33.4 +/- 13.2 after apheresis, p < 0.05) in association with an increase in bradykinin levels (17.9 +/- 2.6 pg/ml before apheresis and 470 +/- 135 after apheresis, p < 0.01). Interestingly, these changes were suppressed during apheresis using NM. There were no appreciable changes in cGMP during DS LDL apheresis with either of the anticoagulants. This finding suggests that bradykinin generated during apheresis has some pathophysiological effects via activation of the prostaglandin system. Our results support the view that in patients taking angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, the anaphylactoid reaction occurring during apheresis may be caused by an excessive rise in the bradykinin levels.", 
    "600": "Type II diabetes is responsible for more end-stage renal disease in the United States than any other single condition. Until recently, the majority of research in diabetic nephropathy has focused on patients with type I diabetes despite the fact that type II nephropathy is a more prevalent condition. The notion that there are major differences between the nephropathy of these two types of diabetes is not supported by recent literature. The biggest difference appears to be related to ethnic risk. Histopathologic differences are now being described as well. Clinical interventional trials are few compared to type I diabetes; however, it seems that maneuvers that improve renal prognosis in patients with type I diabetes (blood pressure control, blood glucose control, and the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) apply to the type II population as well. Some of the calcium channel blockers lower proteinuria to a degree that suggests renoprotection and may further improve outcome.", 
    "601": "Diabetic nephropathy is the single most common cause of end-stage renal disease in the United States. Recently, several major therapeutic interventions have been developed and shown to slow or halt the progression of renal failure in patients with diabetes and diabetic kidney disease. Studies have shown that in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes and proteinuria, lowering systemic blood pressure slows the rate of decline in renal function and improves patients' survival. In the recently completed trial of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition in diabetic nephropathy, ACE inhibitors were specifically shown to decrease dramatically the risk of doubling of serum creatinine or reaching a combined outcome of end-stage renal disease or death independent of their effect on systemic blood pressure. In studies with small numbers of patients, dietary protein restriction has also been shown to slow the rate of decline of renal function. New potential interventions currently undergoing study include treatment with aldose reductase inhibitors, treatment with inhibitors of the formation of advanced glycosylation end-products, treatment of dyslipidemia, and a variety of other less well-studied interventions.", 
    "602": "Diabetic nephropathy is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with diabetes and occurs in about one-third of such patients. The course of nephropathy has become better defined, with patients initially developing microalbuminuria (albumin excretion rates [AER] between 20 and 200 micrograms/min), then overt nephropathy (AER > or = 200 micrograms/min) and finally a decline in GFR eventuating in end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Although metabolic control has long been hypothesized as a contributor to the development of nephropathy, it is only in recent years that this hypothesis has been proven. A number of observational studies have shown correlations between glycemic control and the development of various levels of albuminuria and also declines in GFR. Several small, prospective, randomized, interventional studies and the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) have now definitely proven that improved metabolic control that achieves near-normoglycemia can significantly decrease the development and progression of early nephropathy as well as other long-term complications of diabetes, including retinopathy and neuropathy. It is now conceivable that the achievement of near-normoglycemia plus the addition of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors if microalbuminuria develops may greatly decrease the numbers of patients eventually requiring renal replacement therapy.", 
    "603": "During the past 12 months additional evidence has emerged from observational studies indicating that high blood pressure is an important independent predictor of incident renal damage, progression of existing renal disease, and morbidity and mortality in patients with renal failure. Several of these studies suggest that elevation of systolic blood pressure is a stronger predictor of risk than a corresponding increase in diastolic blood pressure. Furthermore, the relationship between blood pressure and incident renal disease appears to be positive and continuous throughout the entire spectrum of blood pressure, including in the 'normotensive' range. Recent clinical trial experience in patients with renal insufficiency of diverse etiology supports the beneficial effect of treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors noted in earlier studies confined to patients with type II diabetes. Ongoing trials should help clarify optimal choice of antihypertensive medications and goals for reduction of blood pressure in prevention of renal disease. In the interim, two new guidelines for management of hypertension in patients with existing renal disease provide helpful guidance for the clinician.", 
    "604": "The relationship between proteinuria and progression of renal disease has long been an issue of debate. The present review deals with some of the recent publications on this topic. New concepts are emphasized: the possible causal role of proteinuria in the pathophysiology of progressive renal function loss, and the decrease in urinary protein loss at the beginning of renoprotective therapy as a predictor of renal function outcome during this treatment.", 
    "605": "The present study was performed in order to compare the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of lisinopril, a long-acting angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, with captopril, the shorter acting ACE inhibitor available, in the treatment of elderly patients (mean age 70 +/- 0.5 years) with congestive heart failure (mean left ventricular ejection fraction 33.5 +/- 1%). The study was organized according to a double-blind, parallel-group, randomized multicenter protocol. After a 14-day placebo run-in period, patients were randomized to receive either lisinopril 5 mg orally once per day or captopril 12.5 mg orally once per day. The dose of the study drug could be doubled at 2-week intervals for 6 weeks. The maximal dose was lisinopril 20 mg once per day or captopril 25 mg twice per day. The addition of either captopril or lisinopril to a regimen of diuretics caused a significant increase in exercise tolerance assessed by bicycle ergometry after 12 weeks of treatment (530 +/- 21 seconds vs. 431 +/- 13 seconds, p < 0.01; 555 +/- 19 seconds vs. 463 +/- 12 seconds, p < 0.01, respectively). Both drugs significantly increased left ventricular ejection fraction and stroke volume, were equally effective in improving NYHA class, and were well tolerated, with no differences detectable between treatments. The results of this study indicate that lisinopril 5-20 mg once daily is at least as effective and well tolerated as captopril 12.5-50 mg daily in the treatment of elderly patients with congestive heart failure.", 
    "606": "The aim of this study was to compare the effects of a calcium antagonist, nicardipine SR, with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, alacepril, on the regression of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and function. Twenty patients with LVH, aged 42-78 years, were treated with nicardipine SR or alacepril. Ten patients were treated with nicardipine SR (40-80 mg) for 21 months, and the other 10 patients were treated with alacepril (25-100 mg) for 18 months. All patients underwent echocardiography to assess left ventricular structure and function before and after the treatment. After nicardipine SR or alacepril treatment, blood pressure was decreased significantly from 176.0 +/- 13.9/97.0 +/- 5.3 mmHg to 140.0 +/- 14.0/77.4 +/- 7.2 mmHg and from 168.2 +/- 22.3/99.0 +/- 5.5 mmHg to 138.4 +/- 12.5/85.2 +/- 9.7 mmHg, respectively (both p < 0.01), whereas heart rate did not change (73.8 +/- 14.6 beats/min vs. 69.9 +/- 13.5 beats/min and 71.6 +/- 9.7 vs. 65.8 +/- 8.1 beats/min, respectively). The left ventricular mass index decreased significantly from 133.2 +/- 11.7 g/m2 to 114.4 +/- 15.7 g/m2 with nicardipine SR and from 137.1 +/- 14.8 g/m2 to 99.3 +/- 23.0 g/m2 with alacepril (both p < 0.01). The fractional shortening, peak shortening rate, and peak lengthening rate all improved significantly after each treatment. The end-systolic wall stress/left ventricular end-systolic volume index, as an index of left ventricular contractility, was decreased significantly after treatment with nicardipine SR but was not changed after treatment with alacepril. In conclusion, both nicardipine SR and alacepril similarly reduced LVH and improved left ventricular systolic and diastolic function. However, alacepril did not alter left ventricular contractility, whereas nicardipine SR decreased left ventricular contractility.", 
    "607": "The objective of the present-study was to determine whether acute inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), normalizes intrarenal sodium handling, renal haemodynamics and renal dopamine output in response to an i.v. NaCl infusion in type 1 diabetic patients with early nephropathy. Nine diabetic patients (aged 28 +/- 3 years) with elevated urinary albumin excretion (173 +/- 39 mg.min-1) were studied. The effects of a 2-hour NaCl infusion (12.5 ml.kg-1-h-1) on para-amino hippuric acid (PAH), insulin, lithium and sodium clearances as well as the urinary dopamine excretion were studied before and after 2 days of acute ACE inhibition. Fifteen healthy subjects (aged 34 +/- 1 years) served as controls. The results showed that 2 days of ACE inhibition improved the natriuretic response significantly (P < 0.05) within the first 2 h following an i.v. NaCl load due to a normalization of the proximal tubular sodium handling. In control subjects urinary dopamine output increased by 14% (P < 0.01) following i.v. NaCl infusion, whereas a blunted increase was seen in the diabetic patients, which tended to normalize following inhibition of ACE. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that patients with type 1 diabetes and early nephropathy display abnormalities in renal haemodynamics, natriuresis and urinary dopamine mobilization in response to a sodium load, which can be reversed by short-term inhibition of ACE.", 
    "608": "The regional hemodynamic effects of candesartan cilexetil (TCV-116), a selective angiotensin II AT1-receptor antagonist, and enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, were compared in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). A 7-day repeated administration study was carried out. TCV-116 (1 mg/kg, p.o.) and enalapril (10 mg/kg, p.o.) reduced blood pressure to the same extent 5 hr after administration on the 1st and the 7th day. At these points, the cardiac index and organ or tissue blood flow were measured by the non-radioactive colored dye-extraction microsphere technique. Repeated administration of TCV-116, and single and repeated administration of enalapril significantly increased renal blood flow without any changes in the cardiac index. TCV-116 and enalapril also tended to increase splanchnic blood flow following the 1st dose but not the 7th dose. No significant changes in blood flow were observed in the brain, heart, adrenal, skin and skeletal muscle. These results suggest that the antihypertensive effects of TCV-116 and enalapril are attributable to the systemic reduction of vascular resistance caused by the dilatation of blood vessels. These hemodynamic effects of TCV-116, like those of enalapril, may be beneficial in the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "609": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are widely used in treating hypertension and chronic heart failure, but their precise sites and mechanisms of the actions are not completely understood. In this study, we evaluated the acute and chronic in vivo inhibition of ACE by perindopril in both the endothelium and adventitia of large blood vessels including the aorta, carotid, and femoral arteries, heart, lung, and kidney by using in vitro autoradiography with [(125)I]351A as a ligand. After short-term (0.1, 0.3, and 1 mg/kg) or long-term oral administration (0.3 mg/kg), perindopril significantly inhibited plasma ACE (p < 0.001), the plasma angiotensin II (Ang II)/Ang I ratio (p < 0.01), and decreased mean arterial pressure (p < 0.001) in a dose-related manner. In the aorta, carotid, and femoral arteries, free ACE was inhibited to a similar extent in both the endothelium and adventitia by perindopril, in a dose-dependent manner, whereas total ACE in both layers of these vessels was unaltered. Similar short- and long-term ACE inhibition by perindopril was observed in the lung and heart, with somewhat greater inhibition of kidney and plasma ACE. Vascular and tissue ACE inhibition correlated highly with both plasma ACE and the plasma Ang II/Ang I ratio (r = 0.63-0.89; p < 0.001). Whereas the effects of perindopril on blood pressure, plasma Ang II/Ang I ratio, plasma and vascular ACE were all highly dose dependent, there were no significant differences on the degree of ACE inhibition observed between the three large blood vessels or between their adventitial and endothelial layers. These results demonstrate that perindopril readily penetrates the vascular wall after short- or long-term oral administration, and in a dose-dependent manner, potently inhibits both endothelial and advential vascular ACE to a comparable degree. Therefore ACE inhibitors may be beneficial in inhibiting both circulating Ang II and its local formation in the vascular wall.", 
    "610": "Arginine vasopressin (AVP) has been shown to interact with sinoaortic and cardiac reflexes under selected experimental conditions. In humans, there is no evidence that AVP potentiates reflex function at modestly increased plasma levels, except possibly if the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is inhibited. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that a modest physiological increase in plasma AVP would potentiate the responses of heart rate (HR), forearm vascular resistance (FVR), plasma norepinephrine (NE), or systemic NE spillover to baroreflex unloading and loading after pretreatment with lisinopril in healthy human volunteers. Seven normal young men were studied on three occasions. Baseline HR, FVR, and steady-state NE kinetics were established, and AVP or vehicle (5% dextrose in water) was infused for 15 min double-blind on the first 2 days. Baroreflexes were then perturbed as follows: 15 min 60 degrees head-up tilt, 15 min 30 degrees head-down tilt plus 1,000 ml normal saline infusion, 15 min 30 degrees head-down tilt plus phenylephrine titrated to raise mean arterial pressure 10-15 mmHg. The study was repeated on a third day 12 h after 5 mg of lisinopril. Five additional subjects underwent similar baroreflex study on 2 days with only lisinopril and placebo. Before baroreflex deactivation and activation in the absence of lisinopril, AVP infusion had no hemodynamic or neurohormonal effects. During AVP infusion after lisinopril, HR decreased from 67 +/- 6.5 to 62 +/- 4.5 beats/min (P < 0.05). AVP had no effect on the response of any variable during baroreflex perturbation relative to vehicle, either with or without lisinopril. Lisinopril had no independent effect on these responses in the additional five subjects. At modestly increased plasma levels, AVP did not affect the responses of HR, FVR, plasma NE, or systemic NE spillover to baroreflex deactivation and activation. After lisinopril, AVP infusion produced a modest bradycardia but still had no significant positive effect on either response. These data suggest that inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme may unmask mild direct or vagally mediated effects of AVP on HR but does not unmask baroreflex potentiation.", 
    "611": "We report the first case of lichen planus pemphigoides (LPP) secondary to ingestion of ramipril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Clinical, histological and immunofluorescent findings were all consistent with a diagnosis of LPP. Linear basement membrane zone (BMZ) staining with IgG and C3 was only seen at the roof of split-skin preparations and circulating autoantibody to the BMZ was present at a titre of 1/100. Controlled immunoblotting of epidermal extracts detected the bullous pemphigoid antigens of 230 and 180 kDa.", 
    "612": "To further elucidate the mechanisms involved in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, we compared the effects on left ventricular volumes of early (< 48 hours) versus late (45 days) administration of a fixed low dose of enalapril (10 mg) in patients with AMI. We also analyzed the changes of left ventricular volumes after withdrawal of the study drug. Reduced dilation of the left ventricle is one of the beneficial effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition after AMI. However, the nature of this effect is not completely understood.", 
    "613": "We included 89 patients within 48 hours after onset of a first AMI and radionuclide left ventricular ejection fraction less than 45%. The study was double-blind and compared enalapril and placebo with a crossover design. All patients were randomly assigned to a sequence A (enalapril, 45 days; placebo, 45 days) or B (placebo, 45 days; enalapril, 45 days). The end point was the change of left ventricular volume at 45 and 90 days. Thrombolysis was administered to 26 patients (70%) in group A and 25 (75%) in group B. All pretreatment clinical variables were similar in both groups. Median and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of left ventricular diastolic volumes were 46.8 ml/m2 (39 to 61 ml/m2) and 46.6 ml/m2 (39 to 60 ml/m2) for groups A and B, respectively. Baseline end systolic volumes were 28.5 ml/m2 (20 to 36 ml/m2) and 28.9 ml/m2 (23 to 28 ml/m2) in the same groups. Placebo treatment during the initial 45 days was associated with an increase of left ventricular diastolic volume of 8.75 ml/m2 (95% CI, 3.25 to 17.1 ml/m2; p < 0.01) and end-systolic volume of 4.20 ml/m2 (95% CI, 0.00 to 10.1 ml/m2; p < 0.05). No significant changes during other phases of the study were observed. At 45 days left ventricular diastolic volume was 11.1 ml/m2 (95% CI, 0.5 to 2.2 ml/m2), greater in placebo-treated patients compared with patients receiving enalapril.", 
    "614": "In patients with a first Q wave AMI and left ventricular ejection fraction less than 45%, treatment with enalapril can prevent left ventricular dilation. This protective effect involves at least partially a structural modification of the left ventricle. Hence, maximal benefit can be obtained only with early initiation of treatment.", 
    "615": "Knowledge of the electrophysiologic abnormalities in the failing heart is meager. In this work morphologic and electrophysiologic changes were investigated in the cardiomyopathic hamster (BIO TO-2) at 11 months of age. The results were compared with control hamsters (F1B) of the same age.", 
    "616": "Conventional KCl microelectrodes were used to measure membrane potential, conduction velocity, and refractoriness. Histologic studies consisted of Harris' hematoxylin and eosin, Masson trichrome, and von Kossa's calcium stain. The resting potential of myopathic fibers (-67.8 mV; SEM 1 0.83) in the cardiomyopathic hamsters was less negative than the control subjects' potential (-78.5 V; SEM + 1), and the action potential duration measured at 50% of repolarization was increased by 213%. The conduction velocity (36.9 cm/s) was 15.7% lower than that of the control subjects. Enalapril (50 micrograms/mL) caused a hyperpolarization of 6.8 mV, it increased the action potential duration at 90% of repolarization by 110%, and the conduction velocity of the myopathic fibers was appreciably increased compared to the control hamsters'. The refractoriness of myopathic and normal ventricular fibers was also increased by enalapril. Histologic studies performed on the right and left ventricular wall indicated interstitial fibrosis, necrotic foci, and extensive calcification.", 
    "617": "The results indicate severe morphologic and electrophysiologic abnormalities in the failing ventricular muscle. The effect of enalapril on membrane potential and conduction velocity might indicate that the activation of the cardiac renin-angiotensin system during the process of heart failure is, in part, responsible for the abnormalities described here. The improvement of impulse propagation and the increase in refractoriness seem to represent important factors involved in the antiarrhythmic action of enalapril.", 
    "618": "Long-term inhibition of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) by substituted arginine analogues has previously been shown to induce systemic hypertension in several animal species; however, the precise mechanisms for the elevated blood pressure remain unclear. We hypothesized that a portion of the hypertensive response to arginine analogues was due to direct inhibition of endothelial NOS and resultant functional alterations in the vasculature that contribute to elevated systemic resistance. Adult Sprague-Dawley rats were treated for 2 weeks with an arginine analogue, N omega Nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA), alone or in combination with the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor quinapril. Next, thoracic aortas were removed, cut into rings and suspended in isolated tissue baths for measurement of contractile force in response to vasoactive drugs. Our results showed that oral L-NNA treatment significantly elevated systolic blood pressure in rats that was completely prevented by quinapril. Furthermore, L-NNA treatment increased endothelium-dependent and -independent contractility and attenuated endothelium-dependent vasodilation in the thoracic aorta. These functional alterations were also attenuated by quinapril treatment. Therefore, long-term L-NNA-induced hypertension in rats is associated with enhanced vascular reactivity due both to direct inhibition of endothelial NOS and to stimulation of the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "619": "Research into the exact mechanism and site of action of ACE inhibiting compounds has been hampered by methodological difficulties concerning the quantitation of ACE inhibition in tissues. This paper describes an attempt to address this difficulty. ACE activity in serum and uncentrifuged skeletal muscle homogenates was measured with a fluorometric assay before and during treatment in 24 fosinopril-treated and 26 atenolol-treated hypertensives. The absolute difference in activity between the higher and the lower of two different sample dilutions divided by the mean activity was taken to represent competitive inhibition in the sample, \"inhibitor index\". The reduction in muscle ACE activity coinciding with fosinopril treatment was not statistically significant (-2.6%, p = 0.68). The inhibitor index, however, increased by 46% (p = 0.045) and no change was seen in the atenolol-treated group (-12%, p = 0.51). The change in muscle inhibitor index (but not the reduction in serum ACE activity) correlated inversely with the change in blood pressure (r = -0.50, p = 0.034) and serum aldosterone (r = -0.54, p = 0.031) in the fosinopril group, but not in the atenolol group. In a second study, serum inhibitor index increased by 0.28 (95% CI 0.24-0.32) in 12 trandolapril-treated, but was unchanged in 11 atenolol-treated patients (+0.0097, 95% CI -0.029-0.048). In conclusion, the present study indicates that the inhibitor index described recognizes physiologically relevant ACE inhibition. The value of the method needs to be investigated further.", 
    "620": "The mouse is the most commonly used species for in vivo studies on angiogenesis related to tumor development. Yet, to the best of our knowledge, very few reports on the in vitro interaction of the angiogenic basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) with mouse endothelial cells are available. Three mouse endothelial cell lines originated from aorta (MAECs), brain capillaries (MBECs), and heart capillaries (MHECs) were characterized for endothelial phenotypic markers, in vivo tumorigenic activity, and the capacity to respond in vitro to bFGF. These cells express angiotensin-converting enzyme, acetylated LDL receptor, constitutive endothelial nitric oxide synthase, and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and bind Griffonia simplicifolia-I lectin. When injected subcutaneously in nude mice, MAECs induced the appearance of slow-growing vascular lesions reminiscent of epithelioid hemangioendothelioma, whereas MBEC xenografts grew rapidly, showing Kaposi's sarcoma-like morphological features. No lesions were induced by injection of MHECs. MAECs, MBECs, and MHECs expressed both low-affinity heparan sulfate bFGF-binding sites and high-affinity tyrosine kinase receptors (FGFRs) on their surfaces. In particular, MAECs expressed FGFR-2/bek mRNA, whereas microvascular MBECs and MHECs expressed FGFR-1/flg mRNA. Accordingly, bFGF induced a mitogenic response and the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase-2 in all the cell lines. In contrast, upregulation of urokinase-type plasminogen activator expression was observed in bFGF-treated microvascular MBECs and MHECs but not in MAECs. Also, bFGF-treated MBECs and MHECs but not MAECs invaded a three-dimensional fibrin gel and formed hollow, capillary-like structures. The relevance of the modifications of the fibrinolytic balance of mouse microvascular endothelium in bFGF-induced angiogenesis was validated in vivo by a gelatin-sponge assay in which the plasmin inhibitors tranexamic acid and epsilon-aminocaproic acid given to mice in the drinking water inhibited neovascularization induced by the growth factor. In conclusion, differences in response to bFGF exist between large-vessel MAECs and microvascular MBECs and MHECs. Both in vitro and in vivo data point to a role of the profibrinolytic phenotype induced by bFGF in microvascular endothelial cells during mouse angiogenesis. Our observations make these endothelial cell lines suitable for further studies on mouse endothelium during angiogenesis and in angioproliferative diseases.", 
    "621": "Administration of lithium in the diet to new-born rats induces chronic renal failure associated with hypertension, proteinuria and irreversible tubulo-interstitial morphological changes. In the present study we induced chronic renal failure by administration of lithium for 16 weeks to new-born rats, and examined the spontaneous course of this nephropathy and the effects of antihypertensive treatment with either perindopril (12 mg/kg diet) or hydrochlorothiazide (500-1000 mg/kg diet) during a 24 weeks follow up period without lithium. In the placebo group, progression to terminal uraemia occurred in all rats with severe renal failure (initial Purea > 15 mM) (10 of 18). Rats with mild-moderate renal failure (Purea 9-15 mM) showed no deterioration in renal function despite persistent systolic hypertension and irreversible structural renal changes. Perindopril normalized the blood pressure in all rats but did not prevent the progression to terminal uraemia (8 to 18). Hydrochlorothiazide partially controlled the hypertension and accellerated the progression of uraemia without increasing the mortality (7 of 17). Irrespective of treatments, the predominant quantitative structural changes (e.g. decreased volume of proximal tubular cells) showed significant correlations with the degree of renal dysfunction, but not with systolic blood pressure in the surviving rats. It is concluded that progression of lithium-induced nephropathy to terminal uraemia occurs when the nephrotoxic insult results in a more than 50% reduction of the glomerular filtration rate, judged from Purea levels. The failure of effective antihypertensive treatment with an angiotension-converting enzyme inhibitor to modify the progression suggests that in this model, systemic or glomerular hypertension may not be an important pathophysiological factor. The structural and functional deterioration observed in Li-uraemic rats during treatment with hydrochlorothiazide remains unexplained.", 
    "622": "Several studies performed before and after the introduction of fibrinolysis as a routine treatment of patients with myocardial infarction (MI) consistently showed that diabetic patients have a higher mortality in-hospital and after discharge. Women with insulin-dependent diabetes (IDD) appear to have a particularly ominous prognosis. So far, very few randomized prospective studies evaluated the effect of pharmacological treatments on prognosis of diabetic patients during acute MI: most of the information on the effect of commonly used cardiovascular drugs in diabetic patients with acute MI (AMI) has been obtained only from retrospective subgroup analyses of some of the large trials or as nonrandomized comparisons. The overview of fibrinolytic trials in acute MI found that fibrinolytic treatment was associated with a 35 days mortality of 13.6% versus 17.3% in diabetics (-21.7%) and 8.7% versus 10.2% in nondiabetics (-14.3%). Data from trials with aspirin suggest that the beneficial effect of this drug is maintained in diabetic patients with acute MI, but the optimal dosage remains undefined. Based on available evidence, beta blockers appear to be able to reduce mortality post-MI in diabetic patients, with an absolute and relative beneficial effect that is, in most cases, larger than that observed in nondiabetic patients. The pooled data from studies non beta blockers indicate a 37% mortality reduction in diabetic patients, compared to 13% in nondiabetics during the acute phase, and a 48% reduction of mortality compared to 33% in nondiabetics post-discharge. Data on outcome of diabetic patients in trials evaluating calcium antagonists are lacking, and there is a strong need for a reevaluation of data from completed trials to obtain some hints on the possible effect of these agents in this population. The \"long-term\" studies on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in patients with left ventricular dysfunction some time after AMI have shown that the beneficial effect documented in the overall population is present also when limiting the analysis to patients with a history of diabetes, whereas the \"acute\" studies enrolling patients within 24-36 h after the onset of symptoms have shown a marked beneficial effect of ACE inhibitors in diabetic patients. For example, in the GISSI 3 study, treatment with lisinopril was associated with a decreased 6-week mortality in both IDD (11.8% versus 21.1, p < 0.05) and non-IDD (8.0% versus 10.6%, p < 0.05) patients corresponding to a 44.1% and 24.5% reduction, respectively. All these results must be taken with great caution because in no studies the effect of treatment in diabetic patients was a predefined analysis. They strongly suggest, however, that ACE inhibitors and beta blockers may be particularly beneficial during the acute phase of MI and also post-discharge, offering a strong rationale for their widespread use in diabetic patients with acute MI.", 
    "623": "There is clear evidence of the negative influence of type I or II diabetes non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) on the prevalence, severity, and prognosis of cardiovascular disease. Epidemiologic studies have confirmed the relationship between NIDDM and the occurrence of coronary artery disease (CAD) and cardiac heart failure (CHF). The clinical aspects of NIDDM cardiac complications include a high rate of silent events, which merit an improvement in their diagnosis and treatment. Besides pharmacological therapy, aggressive approaches including percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), and coronary surgery should be considered for the treatment of stable angina. IN some subgroups, the benefit of surgery has been proven. Available data indicate that diabetes (both type I and II) is a risk factor for an increase in morbidity and mortality following coronary bypass surgery. These data do not differentiate results between type I and type II diabetes. The indications for surgical revascularization are: three-vessel disease, left main artery stenosis, two-vessel disease including proximal left anterior descending artery stenosis, and two-vessel disease with left ventricular dysfunction. For PTCA, diabetes (type I more than type II) renders the technique more difficult and restenosis more frequent. From the results obtained in the general population and from a few specific studies, it is suspected that, in type II diabetes, PTCA and CABG are superior to conventional medical treatment. However, further specific studies on the beneficial effects of PTCA/CABG over optimal medical therapy are needed, at least in some angiographic conditions. Management of the diabetic patient with acute myocardial infarction is for the most part similar to the nondiabetic patient, with certain special considerations. Treatment includes thrombolytic therapy, invasive management, surgery, PTCA, beta blocker use, and aspirin use. Finally, diabetes mellitus is a cause of systolic and diastolic function, leading to clinical signs of CHF. Conventional medical therapy also applies to cardiac failure complicating diabetes. Medical therapy includes as the first line diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. We conclude that cardiac care can be improved in diabetic patients. For the time being, the first step is to improve the detection of coronary artery disease. As serious events are more likely to occur in the diabetic population, it would be easier (shorter studies and less patients) to demonstrate the benefit of a selected therapy. Further studies are therefore required. In the meantime, special efforts can be made: (1) prevent the development of coronary artery disease. Preventive measures aimed at the control of risk factors at the individual level must be optimal. What should be promoted is a more global approach to the patient, taking into account all parts of the risk factor profile, in order to amplify the reduction in risk and in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. (2) When CAD is confirmed: the goal is to prevent all major cardiac events: unstable angina, myocardial infarction, sudden death, and CHF secondary to silent ischemic events. This can be achieved through the improvement of the accuracy of noninvasive diagnostic procedures, taking into account the cost of these procedures and the absence of pain perception in diabetic patients.", 
    "624": "Diabetic nephropathy is the major cause of illness and premature death in people with diabetes, largely through accompanying cardiovascular disease and end-stage renal failure. Diabetic patients are several times as prone to kidney disease as nondiabetic people and the accumulative risk of diabetic nephropathy in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) is about 30%-50% after 25 years of disease. Diabetic nephropathy is a progressive disease that takes several years to develop, ending in chronic renal insufficiency. Proteinuria heralds the onset of diabetic nephropathy, and the worsening of proteinuria parallels the progression of renal disease. The main risk factors for the frequency, severity, and progression of diabetic nephropathy are the degree of hyperglycemia and associated metabolic disturbances, hypertension, protein overload, cigarette smoking, as well as the duration of diabetes. Interventional strategies for primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention of diabetic nephropathy therefore include meticulous glycemic control, appropriate treatment of associated lipid abnormalities, rigorous control of the blood pressure, reduction in dietary protein intake, in particular animal protein, and of fat intake, and stopping cigarette smoking. Randomized clinical trials indicate that antihypertensive therapy is beneficial in preventing and slowing down the progression of diabetic nephropathy. There is now increasing evidence that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and certain calcium antagonists produce a more beneficial effect on diabetic nephropathy in terms of reducing proteinuria and slowing the progression to diabetic renal failure. These drugs are attributed nephroprotective capacity beyond their blood pressure lowering capacity and initial clinical trials with combinations have revealed even additive protective effects on end organs.", 
    "625": "We compared the effects of two long-term antihypertensive treatments (ACE inhibitors vs. Ca antagonists) on left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and LV function in patients with essential hypertension and LVH. After a washout period of at least 4 wk, ceronapril or delapril was administered to 18 patients and nifedipine or nicardipine to 15 patients for 6 months. Mean blood pressure (MBP), LV mass (LVM), LV fractional shortening (FS), systolic time intervals (ejection time/pre-ejection period ratio = ET/PEP), and isovolumic relaxation time (IRT) were examined in the pretreatment phase and after 6 months of treatment. MBP and LVM significantly and similarly decreased after treatment in both groups (ACE inhibitors vs. Ca antagonists, delta MBP: -17.1 +/- 1.3 vs. -16.9 +/- 1.6%; delta LVM: -11.7 +/- 2.7 vs. -10.0 +/- 3.8%, both p = not significant). ACE inhibitors produced significant beneficial changes in FS, ET/PEP, and IRT after treatment as compared with Ca antagonists (ACE inhibitors vs. Ca antagonists, delta FS: 11.8 +/- 3.3 vs. 5.1 +/- 4.1%, p < 0.05; delta ET/PEP: 11.9 +/- 2.3 vs. 4.7 +/- 6.4%, p < 0.05; delta IRT: -12.0 +/- 3.4 vs. -3.8 +/- 6.1%, p < 0.05). The results indicate that both ACE inhibitors and Ca antagonists induce significant and similar reductions in blood pressure and LVM in hypertensive patients. ACE inhibitors produce significant improvements in LV function in both systolic and diastolic phases as compared with Ca antagonists.", 
    "626": "To clarify the effects of nifedipine and enalapril on cardiac autonomic nervous function during postural changes, power spectral analysis of heart rate variability and humoral factors was performed during tilt tests before and after 3 months of drug administration. The study group consisted of 29 elderly patients with hypertension (mean age, 69 yr), who were divided into two groups: 15 patients received nifedipine (group N) and 14 received enalapril (group E). In group N, systolic blood pressure was significantly decreased and the percent changes in low-frequency coefficient of component variance, normalized low-frequency: high-frequency ratio, and plasma norepinephrine concentration were significantly altered by nifedipine administration. Group E, in contrast, showed no significant decrease in SBP, and only the percent change in high-frequency coefficient of component variance increased significantly after enalapril administration. These results suggest that cardiac autonomic nervous function is markedly impaired during the tilt test after long-term treatment with nifedipine, whereas it is well-maintained after long-term treatment with enalapril.",

At 0, 2, 4, 8 and 16 weeks hearts were removed and perfused in the working heart mode. Control afterload was 80 mm Hg and perfusate K+ was 2.4 mM. Step increases in afterload (20, 40 and 80 mm Hg rises; 20 s duration; 2 min between each) were applied in random order to increase ventricular wall stress and induce arrhythmias.", 
    "629": "Total number of ventricular premature beats (VPBs) elicited by each afterload step were counted. The ratio of left ventricular weight to body weight in the SHR (an index of LVH) showed a rapid and marked decline with captopril treatment (2.65 +/- s.e.m. 0.07 mg/g after 2 weeks treatment compared to 3.38 +/- 0.08 before treatment; P < 0.01), indicating that captopril produced rapid regression of LVH. In contrast, the number of wall stress-induced arrhythmias in SHR did not show a significant decline over the 16 week treatment period. However, when the effect of regression of LVH on wall thickness was taken into account, and compensation was made for differences in wall stress applied, there did appear to be a slow reduction in arrhythmias in SHR. This decline in VPBs was significant after 16 weeks treatment for 40 and 80 mm Hg rises in afterload (P < 0.05).", 
    "630": "Treatment with captopril produced a rapid regression of LVH in the SHR. In contrast, arrhythmias declined more slowly over the 16 week period. There did not appear to be a direct relationship between the degree of regression of LVH and wall stress-induced arrhythmias in this model.", 
    "631": "One of the mechanisms of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in treating diabetic nephropathy is the reversal of renal hypertrophy. Hyperglycemia is the common denominator of all diabetic states. Thus, effects of captopril on high glucose (27.5 mM)-induced alterations in LLC-PK1 cells were studied as related to the facilitative glucose transporters. We found that high glucose (27.5 mM) inhibited mitogenesis and induced hypertrophy in these cells after 48 hours of culture concomitantly with decreased glucose transporter I messenger RNA expression. Captopril (1 mM) reversed the above effects concomitantly with enhancement of glucose transporter I and II messenger RNA expressions. We conclude that decreased expression of glucose transporter I may be associated with increased intracellular glucose and the resultant ill effects. Captopril reversed the above high glucose-induced effects partly by enhancing glucose transporter I and II messenger RNA expressions.", 
    "632": "This study compared the incidence of cough with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor lisinopril and the diuretic metolazone with angiotensin II receptor antagonist losartan in elderly hypertensive patients with previous histories of ACE inhibitor-induced cough. A randomized, double-blind, stratified, parallel-group comparison of lisinopril at 10 mg, losartan at 50 mg, and metolazone at 1 mg, each given once daily for a maximum of 10 weeks, was performed in four hypertension clinics in four centers in two countries. Cough was detected by a questionnaire (the primary end point) given to elderly patients with hypertension, and the cough frequency was quantified by a visual analog scale (a secondary end point). A total of 84 elderly patients with hypertension, all who were nonsmokers with ACe inhibitor-induced cough and were confirmed by lisinopril rechallenge then placebo dechallenge, were randomized to the three treatment groups. The incidence of cough with losartan (18%) was significantly lower than with lisinopril (97%) and similar to that for metolazone (21%). Cough frequency evaluated by the visual analog scale was significantly lower for losartan than for lisinopril and similar to that for metolazone. The specific, selective angiotensin II receptor antagonist losartan is associated with a decrease in the incidence of cough in patients with previous ACE inhibitor-induced cough.", 
    "633": "Patients with longstanding insulin-dependent (Type 1) diabetes mellitus (IDDM) are reported to have microvascular complications in most capillary beds. The microvascular hyperaemia of the skin in normoalbuminuric and microalbuminuric IDDM patients and healthy volunteers was measured with laser Doppler flowmetry. The effect of 3 and 9 months of treatment with captopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, on hyperaemia in the microalbuminuric patients was studied. Mean (+/- SD) pretreatment duration of skin postocclusive reactive hyperaemia was longer in microalbuminuric than in both normoalbuminuric patients and healthy volunteers (118.2 +/- 34.4 vs 57.8 +/- 16.0 vs 63.3 +/- 18.3 sec, respectively, p < 0.00001). After 3 and 9 months of captopril treatment the prolonged hyperaemia was shortened to 78.6 +/- 45.6 s (p < 0.01) and 62.3 +/- 55.6 s (p < 0.03), respectively. Urinary albumin excretion decreased from 63.9 +/- 43.5 to 33.4 +/- 28.1 mg 24 h-1 at 3 months treatment (p < 0.002) and 43.1 +/- 38.5 mg 24 h-1 at the end of the study period (p < 0.02). A positive correlation between changes in urinary albumin excretion and the shortening of the skin postocculsive reactive hyperaemia was found. Blood pressure remained in the same range throughout. These results show that captopril affects skin blood flow, independent of its hypotensive effect. This action may reflect the influence of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor on vascular beds other than those of the kidneys.",

Combination therapy with drugs acting via different mechanisms might be more effective. Therefore, the effects of the calcium antagonist amlodipine and the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor benazeprilat at low and high dose combination on contractions to endothelin-1 and endothelium-dependent relaxations to bradykinin were examined in porcine ciliary arteries.", 
    "635": "Segments of the arteries were suspended in myographs for isometric tension recording.", 
    "636": "Pretreatment of the vessels with either amlodipine, the low or high dose combination significantly reduced the sensitivity to endothelin-1 as compared to control (concentration shift 18.3-fold, 14.2-fold, 23.3-fold respectively; p < 0.05), while benazeprilat was ineffective. The maximal response to endothelin-1 (10(-7) M) was most inhibited by the high dose combination which reduced the contractions by 49% as compared to control (p < 0.05). The low dose combination and amlodipine alone were less effective (reduction: 25%; p < 0.05 and 20%; n.s., respectively). On the other hand, benazeprilat enhanced the sensitivity (concentration shift 73-fold; p < 0.05) and maximal relaxation to bradykinin (by 27%; p < 0.01), whereas amlodipine or the low or high dose combination were ineffective.", 
    "637": "These findings indicate that amlodipine and benazeprilat differently affect vascular function of ciliary arteries. A high dose combination of both substances was most effective in inhibiting contractions to endothelin-1, suggesting a potentiating effect of the two compounds.

    "638": "Responses to T-kinin, a peptide formed from the acute-phase substrate T-kininogen, were investigated in the hindlimb vascular bed of the cat. Under constant-flow conditions, injections of T-kinin into the perfusion circuit in doses of 0.03-1 nmol induced rapid dose-related decreases in perfusion pressure. Responses to T-kinin were similar in time course and magnitude to responses to bradykinin and kallidin and were inhibited by the kinin B2-receptor antagonist, Hoe-140. Responses to T-kinin were attenuated by an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase and by tetraethylammonium chloride and were enhanced in duration by the guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) phosphodiesterase inhibitor zaprinast. Responses to T-kinin were not altered by inhibitors of K+(ATP) channels, by the cyclooxygenase pathway, or by muscarinic or beta-adrenergic-receptor antagonists. These data suggest that vasodilator responses to T-kinin are mediated by kinin B2-receptor-stimulated release of nitric oxide from the endothelium and increased smooth muscle cGMP levels. These results indicate that activation of K+(ATP) channels and muscarinic or beta-adrenergic receptors and the release of vasodilator prostaglandins are not involved in mediating the response to T-kinin in the hindlimb circulation of the cat.", 
    "639": "Diabetic nephropathy represents a major complication in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). Intervention trials using angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have pointed towards the important pathogenetic role of the renin-angiotensin system. Recently an insertion/ deletion (I/D) polymorphism for the gene encoding the ACE has been described, the deletion type being associated with higher plasma ACE levels. As the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system might also be activated in this setting, we determined the ACE genotype together with other risk factors for the development of diabetic nephropathy in 122 patients with IDDM from a single centre with (n = 63) and without (n = 59) nephropathy. Long-term glycaemic control was evaluated using mean HbA1c values from the last 10 years. The two patient group were comparable with regard to duration of diabetes and glycaemic control as assessed by current HbA1c values. However, mean long-term HbA1c values were significantly higher in patients with diabetic nephropathy as was systemic blood pressure. The DD genotype was more prevalent in patients with renal disease. In the subgroup of patients who had had diabetes for more than 20 years (n = 90), the DD genotype was even more frequent in patients with nephropathy, and blood pressure and long-term HbA1c values were also higher in patients with renal disease. Logistic regression analysis revealed long-term glycaemic control, blood pressure and the ACE genotype to be independent risk factors for the prevalence of diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "640": "Amylin (or islet amyloid polypeptide) has been reported to have binding sites in the central nervous system and the kidney and has been shown to activate plasma renin. It has been postulated that this peptide may be an important mechanistic link between hypertension and diabetes in the insulin resistance syndrome. To explore this issue, the effects of rat amylin on mean arterial blood pressure were investigated in anaesthetised rats. Amylin elicited a pressor response of approximately 10 mmHg (maximal at 100 pmol.kg-1) which was apparent within 30-60 s and persisted over 15 min. At higher concentrations amylin elicited a hypotensive response (negative log IC50 8.52 mol.kg-1). The novel amylin receptor antagonist AC413 (12 nmol.kg-1.min-1) reduced the pressor response but not the hypotensive effects of amylin. The peptide antagonist calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)8-37 (12 nmol.kg-1.min-1) reduced the pressor response elicited by amylin and also antagonized the hypotensive effect of amylin. Pre-treatment of animals with the ganglion blocker mecamylamine (3 mg.kg-1 s.c.) reduced the pressor effect of amylin. Following the administration of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor ramiprilat (300 nmol.kg-1 i.v.) the pressor response to amylin was reduced. Salmon calcitonin also elevated blood pressure in the anaesthetised rat; doses of amylin and salmon calcitonin associated with a pressor effect were associated with increases in plasma renin activity. We conclude that amylin may act centrally to elevate blood pressure in the anaesthetised rat, possibly through activation of the renin angiotensin system.", 
    "641": "The effect on heart rate variability of adding digoxin to a diuretic and ACE inhibitor was studied in patients with chronic stable cardiac failure. Digoxin was found to increase heart rate variability, especially those measures of heart rate variability thought to represent parasympathetic activity. The withdrawal of digoxin led to a decrease in heart rate variability to pre-treatment levels. Whilst digoxin in standard doses does not alter prognosis in chronic cardiac failure, it does have potentially beneficial neurohumoral effects. If the increase in heart rate variability, which represents beneficial neurohumoral modulation, can be divorced from the potentially detrimental effects, perhaps by using smaller doses, then there may be a role for digoxin in the treatment of chronic cardiac failure.", 
    "642": "Treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors confers significant morbidity and mortality benefits in patients with heart failure, yet previous studies have repeatedly shown that these drugs are underutilised in general practice. To investigate why this is the case, we conducted an anonymous questionnaire survey of 515 general practitioners in the Nottingham Health District. The response rate was 60.2%. We found that although 39.3% of respondents underestimated the poor prognosis associated with heart failure, 98% were aware of the prognostic benefits conferred by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. However, 46.3% of respondents expressed concern about the potential adverse effects associated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, the main fears being hypotension and renal impairment. General practitioners who were concerned about adverse effects were significantly less likely to have initiated an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor for heart failure than those who were not (P<0.01). Further research is needed to identify which patients can safely be commenced on angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in general practice. In the meantime, general practitioners should be encouraged to refer patients whenever they are concerned about initiating angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in the community.",

This response was similar to that obtained with 100 ng/ml catalase. Increasing enalaprilat concentrations (10, 50 and 100 ng/ml) also significantly decreased the constitutive H2O2 generation in the presence of 5.5 mM glucose. Angiotensin II and saralasin, both at 1 microM, did not modify H2O2 production by cells exposed to 5.5 mM glucose.

Raising the PCO2 from 5% to 20% acidified the solution (pH dropped 0.51 +/- 0.02 U) and caused a sustained and statistically significant 22.9% +/- 4.6% relaxation of pericytes within 5 minutes (n = 8). In the presence of Ang II (10(-6) M), the maximum relaxation induced by 20% PCO2 was only 12.6% +/- 4.5% (n = 6) at 3 minutes, and the relaxation was not sustained. The effect of Ang II was statistically significant. Pretreatment with the competitive Ang II receptor antagonist saralasin (10(-6) M) for 10 minutes completely abolished the effect of Ang II (10(-6) M) on the response of pericytes to 20% PCO2. Saralasin by itself had no effect.",

    "651": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been shown to increase maximal muscle blood flow in parallel to peak VO2 in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). Whether this increase shifts factors limiting peak aerobic capacity from periphery (skeletal muscle or vessels) to central factors (cardiac or respiratory) is unknown. Comparison of peak oxygen consumption (VO2) obtained during leg cycling (VO2 leg) with peak VO2 obtained during combined leg cycling and arm cranking (VO2 arm + leg) allows determination of the relative role of central or peripheral factors. We compared VO2 leg with VO2 arm + leg before and after 3 months of therapy with quinapril 40 mg in 16 patients with CHF (age 53 +/- 13 years) due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction 0.25 +/- 0.07). Before quinapril, VO2 arm + leg was significantly higher than VO2 leg (19.0 +/- 3.3 vs 16.9 +/- 3.8 ml/kg/min, p < 0.001), whereas after therapy these 2 values were similar (20.3 +/- 4.3 vs 21.0 +/- 4.3 ml/kg/min; p = NS), indicating that patients were no longer limited by peripheral factors. Besides, VO2 leg increase after therapy was higher in patients in whom difference between VO2 arm + leg and VO2 leg was the greatest (i.e., in patients who were initially more limited by peripheral factors). Simultaneously, calf peak reactive hyperemia and circumference significantly increased, indicating an improvement in vascular dilating capacity and an increase in skeletal muscle mass. No significant modification occurred in the forearm. Thus, patients who improved the most after 3 months of quinapril therapy were those who were initially limited by peripheral factors. The restricting role of these factors was reduced after quinapril therapy.", 
    "652": "We sought to determine how often angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are prescribed as a discharge medication among eligible patients > or = 65 years old with an acute myocardial infarction; to identify patient characteristics associated with the decision to prescribe ACE inhibitors; and to determine the factors associated with the decision to obtain an evaluation of left ventricular function among patients who have no contraindications to ACE inhibitors. We addressed these aims with an observational study of consecutive elderly Medicare beneficiary survivors of an acute myocardial infarction hospitalized in Alabama, Connecticut, Iowa, and Wisconsin between June 1992 and February 1993. Among the 5,453 patients without a contraindication to ACE inhibitors at discharge, 3,528 (65%) had an evaluation of left ventricular function. Of the 1,228 patients without a contraindication to ACE inhibitors who had a left ventricular ejection fraction < or = 40%, 548 (45%) were prescribed the medication at discharge. In a multivariable analysis, an increased prescribed use of ACE inhibitors at discharge was correlated with several factors, including diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, ventricular tachycardia, and loop diuretics as a discharge medication. Patients admitted after the publication of the Survival and Ventricular Enlargement (SAVE) trial were significantly more likely to receive ACE inhibitors, although the absolute improvement in utilization was small in the 6 months after the trial results were published. In conclusion, improving the identification of appropriate patients for ACE inhibitors and increasing the prescription of ACE inhibitors for ideal patients may provide an excellent opportunity to improve care.", 
    "653": "In long-term intervention studies on renal function outcome an initial decline in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) may occur after starting therapy. If this initial GFR decline is the result of a treatment-induced hemodynamic change reflecting a fall in intraglomerular pressure, it should be reversible after treatment withdrawal, even after long-term treatment. In fact, it could be beneficial for renal function in the long term. We therefore studied systemic and renal hemodynamics in 40 non-diabetic patients with impaired renal function before treatment, during four years treatment with either atenolol or enalapril, and after withdrawal of that treatment. The acute change in GFR 12 weeks after start of treatment varied widely from -11 to + 11 ml/min (mean +/- SD -1.0 +/- 4.1 ml/min, NS). After four years of treatment, withdrawal for 12 weeks resulted in a rise in GFR of +2.2 +/- 5.4 ml/min, P = 0.011, again with a wide range of +14 to -6 ml/min). The initial fall in GFR was related to the rise after withdrawal (r = 0.32, P < 0.05). Interestingly, the acute treatment induced change in GFR correlated with the long-term slope, such that a patient with a greater initial decline in GFR showed a more stable course during the follow up (r = -0.36, P < 0.05). The patients were arbitrarily divided in group A (N = 20), with the largest initial treatment-induced fall in GFR, and group B (N = 20), with the smallest initial fall in GFR. Group A had a significantly less steep slope than group B (-0.41 +/- 1.52 vs. -2.09 +/- 2.79 ml/min/year, P = 0.023) during the four year follow-up. In group A GFR increased again after withdrawal of treatment (+3.8 +/- 5.6 ml/min, P = 0.011) whereas it did not change in group B (+0.5 +/- 4.0 ml/min, NS). As a consequence, GFR post-treatment was not different compared to pre-treatment in group A (-2.5 +/- 7.2 ml/min, NS), whereas it was 5.9 +/- 12.1 ml/min lower in group B (P = 0.023). Patients treated with enalapril had a similar response as patients treated with atenolol. In conclusion, an initial fall in GFR after starting antihypertensive treatment in patients with a mild to moderate renal function impairment (GFR 30 to 90 ml/min) is reversible even after years of treatment, suggesting that this therapy-induced fall is of hemodynamic and not of structural origin. This initial GFR fall was associated with a subsequent stable renal function. These data lead to the hypothesis that the initial fall in GFR in response to antihypertensive therapy reflects renal protection.", 
    "654": "The efficacy of an early and late treatment with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril or the angiotensin II receptor blocker ICI D8731 was investigated in uninephrectomized spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Rats that underwent uninephrectomy (UNX) at six weeks of age were randomly assigned to receive no treatment, lisinopril shortly after UNX, lisinopril starting 16 weeks after UNX, ICI D8731 shortly after UNX, and ICI D8731 starting 16 weeks after UNX. Blood pressure was normalized with both treatments. After six months inulin clearance was not significant different, while proteinuria and prevalence of interstitial fibrosis were significantly reduced in all treatment groups. Immunohistochemical studies revealed an interstitial, periglomerular and perivascular increase of extracellular matrix proteins in all rats, but a markedly reduced expression of collagen I, IV and fibronectin after early and late treatment compared to untreated controls. We found a significant reduction of infiltrating macrophages and T-lymphocytes in all treated animals compared to untreated controls after 2, 4 and 6 months. Especially early treatment was associated with lower numbers of infiltrating cells. Both treatments reduced proliferation of tubular and interstitial cells. There were no striking differences with regard to nephroprotection between the ACE inhibitor and angiotensin II receptor blocker. These findings show that both treatments have beneficial effects on kidney structure and function. They suggest that both ACE inhibition and angiotensin II blockade decrease renal cell proliferation and suppress the infiltration of mononuclear cells that may trigger expression of extracellular matrix proteins and progressive nephrosclerosis.",

Unlike many other ACE inhibitors, its pharmacologically active metabolite,temocaprilat, is excreted predominantly in bile. To investigate the mechanism for the biliary excretion of temocaprilat, we performed in vivo and in vitro experiments using mutant Eisai hyperbilirubinemic rats EHBR) whose canalicular multispecific organic anion transporter (cMOAT) is hereditarily defective. Biliary clearance of temocaprilat after i.v. administration of [14C]temocapril x HCl (1.0 mg/kg) in EHBR was significantly lower than that in Sprague-Dawley rats (5.00 ml/min/kg for Sprague-Dawley rats vs. 0.25 ml/min/kg for EHBR). The uptake of temocaprilat into canalicular membrane vesicles (CMVs) prepared from Sprague-Dawley rats was stimulated in the presence of ATP, whereas little stimulation was observed in CMVs from EHBR. The initial uptake rate of ATP-dependent transport of temocaprilat showed saturation kinetics; we obtained an apparent V(max) value of 1.14 nmol/min/mg protein and a K(m) value 92.5 microM. ATP-dependent transport of temocaprilat was competitively inhibited by 2,4-dinitrophenyl-S-glutathione, a typical substrate for cMOAT with an inhibition constant (K(i)) of 25.8 microM. The K(m) value for the uptake of 2,4-dinitrophenyl-S-glutathione into CMVs (K(m) = 29.6 microM) was consistent with this K(i) value. In addition, the ATP-dependent uptake of 2,4-dinitrophenyl-S-glutathione was inhibited by temocaprilat in a concentration-dependent manner. Active forms of some ACE inhibitors (benazepril, cilazapril, delapril, enalapril and imidapril) did not affect the transport of temocaprilat into CMVs even at concentrations as high as 200 microM. These data suggest that temocaprilat is effectively excreted in bile via cMOAT that is deficient in EHBR and that many of other ACE inhibitors have low affinity for cMOAT.",

However, there is only sparse evidence of the immediate effects of the drug on hearts undergoing global ischemia and reperfusion. The purpose of this study was to investigate the direct effect of captopril, given in cardioplegia or after ischemia, on the functional recovery of the reperfused myocardium.",

    "658": "After ischemia, hearts receiving captopril (360 mumol/L) either in the cardioplegic solution (n = 9) or during reperfusion (n = 9) developed higher pressure (p < 0.001), greater first derivative of the rise in left ventricular pressure (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively), greater first derivative of the fall in left ventricular pressure (p < 0.001 and p < 0.002), higher pressure-time integral (p < 0.001), greater coronary flow (p < 0.001), and higher oxygen consumption values (p < 0.001 and p < 0.003) compared with the control group (n = 9). Hearts receiving captopril both in the cardioplegia and during reperfusion (n = 9) had the best recovery of all three groups and lower levels of creatine kinase (47.8 +/- 5.9 U/L versus 73.3 +/- 5.6 U/L; p < 0.01) compared with the control group.",

    "660": "Angiotensin converting inhibitors (ACEI) not only decrease angiotensin II (Ang II) but also potentiate the effects of bradykinin. Bradykinin is a potent stimulus to tissue type plasminogen activator (t-PA) secretion in animal models. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that bradykinin increase t-PA levels in humans. Bradykinin was infused in seventeen hypertensive patients randomized to treatment with the ACEIs captopril and quinapril or with placebo. Bradykinin caused a significant decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP) (p = 0.014) and increase in pulse (p < 0.001). ACEI significantly potentiated the hemodynamic effect of bradykinin (p < 0.05). Although baseline t-PA antigen levels were similar in the ACEI-treated (6.85 +/- 0.85 ng/ml) and placebo-treated (7.85 +/- 0.68 ng/ml) subjects, bradykinin caused a significant (p < 0.01) increase in t-PA antigen levels (to 19.3 +/- 8.2) only in the ACEI-treated patients. This increase in t-PA was independent of activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Bradykinin had no effect on PAI-1 antigen levels. These in vivo data suggest that infusion of bradykinin results in an increase in circulating t-PA levels without an effect on PAI-1.", 
    "661": "Studies determined the effects of chronic changes in sodium diet on the expression, regulation, and function of different angiotensin II (ANG II) receptor subtypes in renal resistance vessels. Rats were fed low- or high-sodium diets for 3 wk before study. Receptor function was assessed in vivo by measuring transient renal blood flow responses to bolus injections of ANG II (2 ng) into the renal artery. ANG II produced less pronounced renal vasoconstriction in rats fed a low- compared with high-sodium diet (16% vs. 56% decrease in renal blood flow, P < 0.001). After acute blockade of ANG II formation by iv enalaprilat injection in sodium-restricted animals, ANG II produced a 40% decrease in renal blood flow, a level between untreated dietary groups and less than high salt diet. Intrarenal administration of angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonists losartan or EXP-3174 simultaneously with ANG II caused dose-dependent inhibition of ANG II responses. Based on maximum vasoconstriction normalized to 100% ANG II effect in each group, AT1 receptor antagonists produced the same degree of blockade in all groups, with an apparent maximum of 80-90%. In contrast, similar doses of the angiotensin II receptor type 2 (AT2) receptor ligand CGP-42112 had only a weak inhibitory effect. In vitro equilibrium-saturation 125I-ANG II binding studies on freshly isolated afferent arterioles indicated that ANG II receptor density was lower in the low- vs. high-sodium animals (157 vs. 298 fmol/mg, P < 0.04); affinity was similar (0.65 nM). Losartan and EXP-3174 displaced up to 80-90% of the ANG II binding; fractional displacement was similar in both diet groups. In contrast, the AT2 receptor analogues PD-123319 and CGP-42112 at concentrations < 10(-6) M had no effect on ANG II binding. RT-PCR assays revealed the expression of both angiotensin II receptor type 1A (AT(1A)) and angiotensin II receptor type 1B (AT(1B)) subtypes in freshly isolated afferent arterioles, while there was very little AT2 receptor expression. Total AT1 receptor mRNA expression was suppressed by low sodium intake to 66% of control levels, whereas it was increased to 132% of control by high-sodium diet, as indicated by ribonuclease protection assay. Receptor regulation was associated with parallel changes in AT(1A) and AT(1B) expression; the AT(1A)/AT(1B) ratio was stable at 3.7. We conclude that AT1 receptors are the predominant ANG II receptor type in renal resistance vessels of 7-wk-old rats. Chronic changes in sodium intake caused parallel regulation of expression and amount of receptor protein of the two AT1 receptor genes that modulate receptor function and altered reactivity of renal vessels to ANG II.", 
    "662": "Treatment of abnormal remodeling and dysfunction of left ventricle after myocardial infarction is one of the major goals of recent therapeutic interventions. The current study, the Nisoldipine Enalapril Anterior Myocardial infarction Study pilot investigation, was designed to investigate the effects of 12 weeks of treatment with enalapril or nisoldipine or their combination on left ventricular (LV) function and exercise capacity in patients with recent (< 1 month) anterior myocardial infarction and mild LV dysfunction (LV ejection fraction [EF] 38% to 48%). Forty-six patients were studied and received, by random assignment, enalapril (5 mg once per day) plus placebo (n = 14) or nisoldipine (10 mg two times per day) plus placebo (n = 18) or enalapril (5 mg once per day) plus nisoldipine (10 mg two times per day) (n = 14). All patients received aspirin (325 mg) throughout the study. Data on LV EF and peak filling rate at rest and LV EF during exercise were collected during radionuclide ventriculography. In addition, the product of heart rate and systolic blood pressure (rate-pressure product) and exercise time were determined during exercise stress testing. The analyzed parameters were not significantly modified after treatment with enalapril or with nisoldipine. In contrast, the combination of enalapril and nisoldipine significantly raised LV EF at rest (from 43% +/- 3% to 48% +/- 6%, p < 0.01) and during exercise (from 45% +/- 8% to 50% +/- 9%, p < 0.01) and raised peak filling rate at rest (fraction of end-diastolic volume per second) from 1.57 +/- 0.3 to 1.67 +/- 0.3 (p < 0.05). In addition, the combined administration of the two drugs increased the rate-pressure product (values x 10(3)) (from 20.7 +/- 5 to 22.7 +/- 4, p < 0.05) and increased exercise time (from 573 +/- 173 seconds to 668 +/- 178 seconds, p < 0.05). These results show that in patients with recent anterior myocardial infarction and mild LV dysfunction, the combination of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril and the dihydropyridine nisoldipine improves resting LV systolic and diastolic function and exercise LV systolic function and exercise capacity.", 
    "663": "Single drug therapy for the treatment of hypertension has traditionally been a standard of practice. More recently combination therapy as first-line treatment has gained acceptance both by the medical practice community and the US Food and Drug Administration. The advantages of combinations may be a synergistic or additive antihypertensive effect, metabolic improvement, or both. The combination of a thiazide-type diuretic and a potassium-sparing diuretic has been quite useful in the past to prevent the need for potassium supplementation. The combination of beta-adrenoceptor blockade and a thiazide diuretic results in an additive antihypertensive effect that permits the effective use of very low thiazide doses. The mechanism of antihypertensive effects of each member of the combination are complimentary with increased sympathetic outflow and renin-angiotensin axis activation induced by the diuretic being blunted by beta1-adrenergic blockade. Combinations not used as first-line therapy, such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockade and a thiazide diuretic, have complimentary antihypertensive mechanisms and have been useful in treating patient groups who do not respond well to converting enzyme inhibitor monotherapy. The combination of a calcium antagonist with diuretic therapy has an additive hypertensive effect as well; however, the complimentary mechanisms are less obvious. Finally, the combination of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition and calcium antagonist therapy has been useful in selected patients, but again the complimentary mechanisms are less obvious. As first-line therapy, combinations for diuretics and beta1-receptor blockers have been useful for achieving increased antihypertensive effect with decreased adverse drug effect.", 
    "664": "There is controversy over whether endothelial function is impaired in human essential hypertension. All studies to date have used measurements of forearm blood flow by plethysmography to assess endothelium-dependent vasodilation and endothelial function. In contrast to these studies, which have focused on resistance vessels, we have determined what effects the endothelium has on underlying smooth muscle cells in conduit arteries by measuring arterial compliance of the radial arteries (change in diameter of radial artery over pressure for each arterial pulse). In 13 normotensive healthy subjects and 11 young patients with essential hypertension, arterial compliance of the radial artery was assessed directly with a new high-precision ultrasonic device (NIUS 02) after infusion of acetylcholine (endothelium-dependent response) or sodium nitroprusside (endothelium-independent response). Arterial compliance of the radial artery was similar at baseline and with increasing doses of acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside in normotensive and in hypertensive subjects. The increase in arterial compliance from baseline at each individual concentration of acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside was the same in both normotensive and hypertensive subjects. However, after a single oral dose of a combination of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor spirapril and the calcium entry blocker isradipine, the increase in arterial compliance in response to the maximum dose of intraarterial acetylcholine was enhanced in normotensives (0.38 +/- 1.23 to 0.76 +/- 1.01 mm2/mm Hg x 10(-3), P < .05), but not in hypertensives (+0.41 +/- 1.26 to 0.36 +/- 1.31 mm2/mm Hg x 10(-3), not significant), and differed significantly between normotensive and hypertensive subjects (P < .05). Thus, pharmacologic stimulation disclosed a blunted response of endothelium-dependent action in the arterial compliance of the conduit arteries in hypertensive subjects. This suggests an impaired endothelial function reserve in persons with essential hypertension.", 
    "665": "To estimate the effects of UP269-6, a nonpeptide angiotensin II receptor antagonist, and captopril, a converting enzyme inhibitor, on the progression of nephropathy, 77 uninephrectomized diabetic rats were maintained for 8 months with plasma glucose levels from 300 to 500 mg/dL. Systemic and renal parameters were periodically measured, and, at the time of death, a histological evaluation of renal damage was performed. Control rats (no additional treatment but insulin) showed increased blood pressure and urinary albumin levels, together with prominent alterations in the kidney (renal and glomerular hypertrophies, tubular atrophy, and 19% of sclerotic glomeruli). Captopril (50 mg/kg/day) and UP269-6 (10 mg/kg/day) reduced blood pressure and albumin excretion levels, and improved histological renal preservation (lower renal and glomerular hypertrophies, tubular atrophy, and percentage of sclerotic glomeruli: 5% and 7%, respectively). Finally, a low dose of UP269-6 (1 mg/kg/day), which induced an intermediate level of blood pressure between control and the other treated groups, produced an equivalent degree of nephroprotection. Our data demonstrate the efficacy of this new angiotensin II receptor antagonist on the progression of diabetic renal damage. These results also reinforce the role attributed to angiotensin II in the development of renal derangement in this model, as UP269-6 is devoid of agonistic effect on the kinin system.", 
    "666": "The relationship between high blood pressure and the incidence of stroke is well established. Currently the effects of lowering blood pressure in patients with established cerebrovascular disease is undetermined, and there is continuing concern regarding the treatment of patients soon after a stroke event. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors maintain cerebral blood flow despite lowering blood pressure in patients with heart failure and otherwise uncomplicated hypertension. We tested the hypothesis that perindopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor with a gradual onset of action and a minimal first-dose hypotensive effect, lowers blood pressure without adversely affecting cerebral blood flow in patients 2 to 7 days after symptoms of cerebral infarction.", 
    "667": "Patients were randomized to receive 15 days of oral perindopril (4 mg) or placebo in a double-blind study. Blood pressure was monitored semiautomatically. Cerebral blood flow was calculated from internal carotid artery and vertebral Doppler ultrasound, supplemented by middle cerebral artery blood velocities.", 
    "668": "Twenty-four patients completed the protocol; four additional patients were withdrawn for reasons unrelated to treatment. Patients on perindopril had a placebo-corrected reduction in blood pressure of 19/11 mm Hg. Blood pressure remained reduced after 2 weeks of treatment. In contrast, total cerebral blood flow was unaffected by perindopril. Neurological symptoms improved similarly in both groups.",

    "670": "Whereas the protein product of the Bcl-2 gene inhibits apoptosis, the protein product of the Bax gene acts as a promoter of apoptosis. To gain insight into the regulation of apoptosis in vascular smooth muscle cells in arterial hypertension, we investigated the expression of the proteins Bcl-2 and Bax in small intramyocardial arteries of 36-week-old normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). In addition, 16-week-old SHR were treated for 20 weeks with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor quinapril and killed at 36 weeks of age. We measured the percentages of smooth muscle cells expressing these proteins using monoclonal antibodies and the avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method. Compared with WKY, untreated SHR exhibited increased (P<.001) Bcl-2 expression and similar Bax expression. Values of Bcl-2 measured in quinapril-treated SHR were significantly lower than values measured in untreated SHR and similar to values measured in WKY. Quinapril-treated SHR showed higher (P<.001) Bax expression than WKY and untreated SHR. Bcl-2 expression was directly correlated with systolic pressure. Inverse correlations were found between the expression of Bax and the activities of both cardiac and circulating angiotensin-converting enzyme. These findings suggest that smooth muscle cell apoptosis might be inhibited in small arteries of adult SHR as a consequence of an excess of the protein Bcl-2. In addition, our results suggest that chronic angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition might restore the susceptibility to apoptosis in these cells through stimulation of the protein Bax.",

Forty patients (17 men and 23 women) of a mean age of 51 (range 19-68) years, free of coronary artery disease and arterial hypertension, were randomized into a quinapril or placebo group. HRV was recorded at months 0, 3, and 6. The parameters measured were 1) time domain indexes: SD of all 24-h R-R intervals (intervals between consecutive electrocardiogram R waves), or SDNN/24-h; mean of SD of R-R intervals of all 5-min segements (SDNN/5-min); root-mean-square of the differences of successive R-R intervals (RMSSD); and percentage of the R-R intervals differing more than 50 ms (pNN50); and 2) frequency domain indexes: total power (TP), high-frequency power (HFP), low-frequency power (LFP), and very-low-frequency power (VLFP).

    "675": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have proven to be effective in the reduction of ischemia/reperfusion damage after myocardial ischemia. Whether this favorable effect can be related to other models of ischemia and reperfusion has not yet been investigated. Therefore, we studied in a model of syngeneic liver transplantation in the rat the effect of recipient enalapril treatment on postischemic liver injury. Untreated animals served as the control group. Treatment with enalapril was started 5 minutes before reperfusion by intravenous infusion of enalapril at a dosage of 5 mg/kg/h. By means of in vivo microscopy, the sinusoidal perfusion rate and leukocyte adherence in sinusoids and postsinusoidal venules were analyzed during 45 to 60 minutes of reperfusion. Liver function was monitored by measuring bile output over a period of 60 minutes. Analysis of coagulation factors (prothrombin time, factor V, fibrinogen) and liver enzymes (alanine transaminase [ALT], aspartate transaminase [AST]) served for the evaluation of organ dysfunction and damage secondary to ischemia/reperfusion injury. The sinusoidal perfusion rate was significantly improved by enalapril treatment (94.7% [1.0] vs. 75.3% [3.8]; mean [SEM]; P = .005). In addition, leukocyte-sticking in both liver sinusoids and postsinusoidal venules was remarkably reduced in enalapril-treated animals as compared with controls (stickers/lobule: 21.0 [3.3] vs. 59.2 [2.1]; P = .0004; stickers/mm2 venular surface: 20.5 [4.7] vs. 110.3 [18.1]; P = .0004). Moreover, bile output was increased (1.13 [0.35] vs. 0.43 [0.18] g bile/60 min x 100 g liver; P = .06). Values for PT (22.5% [2.1] vs. 9.7% [1.8]; P = .005), factor V 99.4% [9.5] vs. 49.5% [8.5]; P = .007), and fibrinogen (64.1% [7.7] vs. 12.8% [3.2]; P = .001) were significantly improved, paralleled by a remarkable reduction in serum ALT (1,428 U/L [190] vs. 2,315 [248]; P = .02). Our data show for the first time that ACE inhibition in the liver recipient by enalapril attenuates hepatic ischemia/reperfusion damage after experimental liver transplantation. Our results may offer a novel approach to reduce ischemia/reperfusion injury in clinical liver transplantation.", 
    "676": "The effect of chronic inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme on dopamine content and release in the striatum was investigated using in vivo microdialysis in awake, freely moving rats. Rats were treated for 1 week with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril (1 mg/kg) via the drinking water, whereas the controls were given water alone. One week after perindopril treatment, striatal dopamine dialysate levels in the treated group were markedly elevated compared with control values: control, 233 +/- 43 pg/ml; perindopril, 635 +/- 53 pg/ml (p < 0.001). These results were confirmed by a complementary study in which dopamine content was measured in striatal extracts (3.5 +/- 0.4 micrograms of dopamine/g of tissue for controls compared with 9.2 +/- 2.4 micrograms of dopamine/g of tissue for the treated group; p < 0.05). In the rats that were dialyzed, angiotensin-converting enzyme levels in the striatum were decreased by 50% after perindopril treatment. Levels of dopamine D1 and D2 receptors and of preprotachykinin and tyrosine hydroxylase mRNAs were unchanged after angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition. A small, but significant, increase was detected in striatal preproenkephalin mRNA levels in the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-treated group. These results indicate that peripherally administered angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors penetrate the blood-brain barrier when given chronically and modulate extracellular dopamine and striatal neuropeptide levels.", 
    "677": "This study was performed to ascertain the degree to which the care of hospitalized diabetic and hypertensive patients conforms to published guidelines for the detection and management of early renal disease. It was designed as a retrospective chart audit. Six hospitals, four nonurban referral centers, and two urban teaching institutions provided the data. Patients were a random sample of Medicare beneficiaries, with a mean age (SD) of 65.6 (9.1) years, admitted during 1994 with a primary or secondary diagnosis of either diabetes (n = 260) or hypertension (n = 327). A urinalysis was obtained for 163 (62.7%) of the diabetic patients. Among diabetics who had their urine tested, 31.3% had 1+ or greater dipstick proteinuria. A serum creatinine was obtained for 298 (91%) of the hypertensive patients, and 11.8% had a value of 1.5 mg/dL or greater. Abnormal renal function tests were recorded in the discharge summaries of 7.8% of the diabetic and 11.4% of the hypertensive patients. Patients with abnormal renal function were no more likely to be treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs). Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were prescribed for 6% of diabetic and 8.8% of hypertensive patients with abnormal renal function at discharge.

We performed a 1-year, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, controlled study comparing nisoldipine (20-40 mg once daily) with lisinopril (10-20 mg once daily) in 52 hypertensive IDDM subjects with diabetic nephropathy. Three patients dropped out, and results for the remaining 49 (25 nisoldipine, 24 lisinopril) are presented. Diuretics were required in 10 nisoldipine- and 8 lisinopril-treated patients. Every 3 months, 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (TM2420, A&D, Tokyo, Japan) and albuminuria in three 24-h samples (enzyme immunoassay) were measured; GFR (51Cr-EDTA plasma clearance) was recorded every 6 months. Mean arterial blood pressure (24 h) was reduced from (mean +/- SE) 108 +/- 3 mmHg at baseline to 101 +/- 2 in average during treatment in the lisinopril group and from 105 +/- 2 to 103 +/- 2 in the nisoldipine group (P = 0.06 comparing changes in the two groups). Albuminuria was reduced 47% (95% CI 21-65) in the lisinopril group versus an increase of 11% (-3 to 27) in the nisoldipine group (P = 0.001). Fractional albumin clearance was reduced 37% (95% CI 4-59%) in the lisinopril versus an increase of 35% (8-69%) in the nisoldipine group (P < 0.01). GFR decreased from 85 +/- 5 ml x min(-1) x 1.73 m(-2) to 73 +/- 5 in the lisinopril group and from 84 +/- 6 to 80 +/- 7 in the nisoldipine group (P < 0.05). The effect of study medication on albuminuria and GFR was independent of changes in systemic blood pressure and baseline variables in multiple regression analyses. In summary, lisinopril reduced albuminuria, but also GFR, to a greater extent than did nisoldipine in hypertensive IDDM patients with diabetic nephropathy during the 1st year of treatment. Longer follow-up is required to clarify whether these drugs have different renoprotective effects.", 
    "679": "Recent in vitro studies suggest that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors stimulate endothelial cell proliferation and migration. The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that an ACE inhibitor may accelerate endothelial regrowth in vivo. Twenty eight New Zealand White rabbits were randomized to receive placebo or the ACE inhibitor perindopril and underwent iliac balloon denudation. Endothelial regrowth, quantified 28 days after injury using Evans blue, was significantly greater in perindopril-treated animals than in controls (131 +/- 9 mm2 vs 69 +/- 8 mm2; P < .001). These results were confirmed by scanning electron microscopy and by specific immunostaining for endothelial cells. These data provide the first in vivo demonstration that ACE inhibitors accelerate endothelial regrowth after arterial injury. This effect may contribute to the benefit observed with ACE inhibition following arterial injury.",

Two lower intensity mRNA bands of 3.5 kb and 5.7 kb also hybridized to the cDNA clone. Radioimmunoassay for the CNP was performed using the antiserum against rat CNP. The presence of CNP immunoreactivity was detected in the low molecular weight fraction of the Bothrops jararaca venom.", 
    "689": "To assess the quality of secondary prevention in patients with known coronary artery disease (CAD) we analyzed prospectively 278 consecutive patients on admission who were hospitalized for acute coronary syndromes (infarction 46%, unstable angina 54%). CAD was known in 155 patients (110 males: acute myocardial infarction 50, unstable angina 105; history of infarction 55%, chronic angina 41%, after CABG 13%, after PTCA 7%, coronary stenoses on angiography 6%). In these patients, aspirin was being administered in 58%, anticoagulation in 12%, betablockers in 43%, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) in 20%, and lipid lowering agents in 12%. Calcium blockers were given in 40% (nifedipine 8%). Patients with previous invasive diagnosis and treatment were more frequently treated with drugs of proven prognostic benefit than patients after myocardial infarction and patients with angina only, while overall cardiovascular treatment was similar. The respective rates of treatment were: for aspirin 78%, 60% and 39% respectively (p = 0.0005); for betablockers 59%, 46% and 24% (p = 0.004); for lipid lowering drugs 27%, 7% and 4% (p = 0.002). 12 of 19 patients with known congestive heart failure had ACEI. Only one fourth of dyslipidemic patients had lipid lowering drugs. We conclude that the prevalence of secondary prophylaxis in patients with known CAD is too low despite proven benefit, invasively treated patients having better prophylaxis.",

After a 4-week, single-blind placebo baseline period, 707 patients with sitting diastolic blood pressures (BPs) in the range of 95 to 115 mm Hg received placebo, enalapril (5 or 20 mg), felodipine ER (2.5, 5, or 10 mg), or their combinations for an 8-week double-blind treatment period. All doses of enalapril and felodipine ER had a statistically significant (p < 0.05) additive effect in reducing both systolic and diastolic BP. The trough to peak ratios for the combinations ranged from 0.63 (enalapril 5 mg-felodipine ER 2.5 mg) to 0.79 (enalapril 20 mg-felodipine ER 10 mg) and were consistent with effective BP control with 1 dose/day. Patients aged > or = 65 years demonstrated a greater reduction in diastolic BP. Combinations of enalapril-felodipine ER were associated with less drug-induced peripheral edema (4.1%) compared to felodipine ER monotherapy (10.8%). There were no serious drug-related adverse effects observed during the study. In this trial, the combination of enalapril and felodipine ER effectively lowered BP and was generally well tolerated with an excellent safety profile when used in the treatment of hypertension.",

Several combined mechanisms reduce the compensatory ability of the noninfarcted myocardium; such mechanisms include preexisting congestive heart failure caused by diabetic cardiomyopathy, severe coronary artery disease, decreased vasodilatory reserve of epicardial and resistance arteries, and possibly abnormal metabolism of myocardial substrate. Late mortality results from increased reinfarction rates caused by the diffuse nature of the atherosclerotic disease and hypercoagulable state. Platelet hyperactivity, reduced fibrinolytic capacity, increased concentrations of hemostatic proteins, and endothelial dysfunction promote thrombosis at the site of plaque rupture. Autonomic neuropathy predisposes patients to ventricular arrhythmias. Thrombolytic agents, aspirin, beta-blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are effective in patients with diabetes.",

This increased mortality rate is caused by diverse mechanisms that affect myocardial function and blood supply and by the tendency toward thrombosis in diabetic patients. Current therapies for myocardial infarction are effective in these patients. Improved metabolic control may also decrease mortality rates.", 
    "697": "The design, synthesis, and biochemical profile of meta-substituted benzofused macrocyclic lactams are described. The meta-substituted benzofused macrocyclic lactams were designed to have a degree of flexibility allowing the amide bond to occupy two completely different conformations while maintaining sufficient rigidity to allow for strong interaction between enzyme and inhibitor. Using TFIT, a novel molecular superimposition program, it was shown that the meta analogs could be readily superimposed onto our ACE inhibitor template whereas no low-energy superimpositions of the ortho-substituted macrocycles could be found. The macrocycles were prepared by tethering aldehyde 1 derived from S-glutamic acid or S-aspartic acid to a meta-substituted phosphonium bromide 2. Homologation to a monocarboxylic acid methyl ester malonate followed by deprotection and cyclization gave the macrocyclic frame. Further manipulation gave the desired compounds. Unlike the ortho-substituted benzofused macrocyclic lactams described in the previous paper which are selective NEP inhibitors, the meta-substituted compounds are dual inhibitors of both NEP and ACE. The most potent member of this new series, compound 16a, inhibited both enzymes with an IC50 = 8 nM in NEP and 4 nM in ACE.", 
    "698": "Improvement of symptoms, increase in exercise capacity and prevention of disease progression are the aims of drug therapy in patients with congestive heart failure. At present only the ACE inhibitors are able to achieve all therapeutic targets and should therefore be regarded as drugs of first choice in systolic dysfunction. Diuretics are also necessary in most patients since they rapidly reduce pulmonary congestion and peripheral oedema, but have no documented beneficial long term effects on the course of CHF. Digoxin remains a useful drug to treat symptomatic patients who do not respond adequately to the combination of ACE inhibitors and diuretics, as well as in patients with atrial fibrillation. However, a reduction of mortality by digitalis glycosides cannot be expected. A new trend in the treatment of CHF is the utilisation of beta blockers. These drugs showed positive effects in chronic CHF in several studies, particularly in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. Newer drugs such as carvedilol, seem to improve the symptoms and reduce complications even in CHF due to coronary artery disease. The role of beta blockers in the routine management of patients with heart failure requires further evaluation.",

Few synthetic methodologies toward such moieties allow for incorporation of a stereodefined substituent on the ring nitrogen (i.e., corresponding to an amino acid side chain). Enantiopure Freidinger lactams were obtained by (1) condensation of (S)-tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc)-protected 2-aminocycloalkanones with commercially available alpha-amino esters, (2) oxidation of the resulting imines with m-CPBA to give spirocyclic oxaziridines, and (3) photorearrangement. Conformational analyses of seven- and eight-membered dipeptidyl lactams by NMR and by X-ray crystallography are described. The utility of this chemistry was illustrated by the synthesis of potential inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE).", 
    "700": "The sites of glycosylation of Chinese hamster ovary cell expressed testicular angiotensin-converting enzyme (tACE) have been determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight/mass spectrometry of peptides generated by proteolytic and cyanogen bromide digestion. Two of the seven potential N-linked glycosylation sites, Asn90 and Asn109, were found to be fully glycosylated by analysis of peptides before and after treatment with a series of glycosidases and with endoproteinase Asp-N. The mass spectra of the glycopeptides exhibit characteristic clusters of peaks which indicate the N-linked glycans in tACE to be mostly of the biantennary, fucosylated complex type. This structural information was used to demonstrate that three other sites, Asn155, Asn337, and Asn586, are partially glycosylated, whereas Asn72 appears to be fully glycosylated. The only potential site that was not modified is Asn620. Sequence analysis of tryptic peptides obtained from somatic ACE (human kidney) identified six glycosylated and one unglycosylated Asn. Only one of these glycosylation sites had a counterpart in tACE. Comparison of the two proteins reveals a pattern in which amino-terminal N-linked sites are preferred. The functional significance of glycosylation was examined with a tACE mutant lacking the O-glycan-rich first amino-terminal 36 residues and truncated at Ser625. When expressed in the presence of the alpha-glucosidase I inhibitor N-butyldeoxynojirimycin and treated with endoglycosidase H to remove all but the terminal N-acetylglucosamine residues, it retained full enzymatic activity, was electrophoretically homogeneous, and is a good candidate for crystallographic studies.", 
    "701": "The angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity of a tryptic digest of bovine beta-lactoglobulin (beta-lg) was investigated. Intact beta-lg essentially did not inhibit ACE while the tryptic digest gave an 84.3% inhibition of ACE. Peptide material eluting between 20 and 25% acetonitrile during C18 solid-phase extraction of the beta-lg tryptic digest inhibited ACE by 93.6%. This solid-phase extraction fraction was shown by mass spectroscopy to contain beta-lg f(142-148). This peptide had an ACE IC50 value of 42.6 micromol/l. The peptide was resistant to further digestion with pepsin and was hydrolysed to a very low extent with chymotrypsin. The contribution of specific amino acid residues within the peptide to ACE inhibitory activity and the potential application of this peptide as a nutraceutical is discussed.",

Here, the case of a 53-year-old man with massive swelling of the tongue after dental surgery is presented who had started with ACE inhibitor therapy only 24 h before. At admission to the clinic, obstruction of the upper airway due to the tongue swelling had already progressed so far that fiberoptic intubation was necessary. Additionally, the patient was treated with corticosteroids, antihistaminics and epinephrine, avoiding any further administration of the ACE inhibitor. The swelling resolved within 48-72 h.

Clinic blood pressure (with the patient seated and erect) was measured 2 and 4 weeks after the therapy had been started and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring with a SpaceLabs device was performed for 26 h during week 4. The patients then crossed over to the other time of dosage and the measurements were repeated. The study was conducted from a hospital clinic.", 
    "705": "The clinic analysis concerned all 20 patients but the ambulatory analysis concerned 18 patients because the ambulatory blood pressure monitor data sets were inadequate for two patients. Compliance was high (97 +/- 3%), with a suggestion that it was better with the 0900 h dose. Clinic blood pressure (with the patient seated and erect) was lower under both regimes and the blood pressure with night-time administration of perindopril tended to be lower than that with daytime administration (P = 0.05-0.10). Twenty-four-hour mean, daytime and night-time means were lower with both doses than they were with placebo and did not differ. Both regimes reduced the early morning peak blood pressure rise and the effect tended to be greater with the 2100 h dose (P = 0.05-0.10). The 0900 h dose had an effect that persisted for > 24 h but the effect of the 2100 h dose had dissipated 18 h after the dose. There was no excessive night-time fall in blood pressure with the 2100 h dose. The trough : peak ratio with the 0900 h dose was 0.86 for systolic and 0.70 for diastolic blood pressure.",

However, the 2100 h dose regime does not reduce blood pressure over 24 h whereas 24 h control is achieved with the 0900 h dose. In clinical practice the 2100 h dose would have been titrated to the next dose range in more patients. This study indicates that the response profile obtained with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor cannot be transformed from one dose time to another automatically and that chronobiology has important effects on a drug's action.",

After a 14-day wash-out and a 14-day placebo run-in period, therapy was initiated with verapamil 180 mg plus trandolapril 2 mg. At monthly visits, if mean daytime diastolic BP remained > or = 90 mmHg, the dose combination was uptitrated stepwise to verapamil 240 mg plus trandolapril 4 mg, verapamil 360 mg plus trandolapril 4 mg, and finally hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg were added. Mean 24-hour BP dropped from 150 +/- 14/96 +/- 7 mmHg at baseline to 131 +/- 13/82 +/- 8 mmHg after 4 months treatment (p < 0.001). In 16 (76%) patients mean 24-hour diastolic BP was < 90 mmHg at the end of the trial and 15 (71%) patients achieved a reduction of > 10 mmHg. Five out of 5 patients finishing on dose I were controlled, 5/6 patients on dose II, 5/8 patients on dose III, and 1/2 patients who received additional hydrochlorothiazide. The 24-hour BP load fell from 72 +/- 8% at baseline to 35 +/- 25% in 4 months (p < 0.001). Mean diastolic BP drop for the 2 peak hours during daytime was 20 mmHg and for the last 2 hours of monitoring was 13 mmHg, resulting in a trough to peak ratio of 65%. There were no significant adverse events or biochemical abnormalities. It is concluded that the combination doses tested showed a sustained and marked antihypertensive effect throughout the 24-hour dosing interval, and the starting dose (verapamil 180 mg plus trandolapril 2 mg) seems appropriate in this group of patients.", 
    "727": "We recently reported that intrarenal vascular AT1 angiotensin II (ANG II) receptors are major determinants of the increased vascular resistance and reactivity to ANG II observed in the kidney of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). We decided to test the hypothesis that, by modifying plasma ANG II levels by inhibiting the ANG II-converting enzyme (ACE) with captopril, we would modify intrarenal ANG II receptors, and therefore the renal vascular response to ANG II. Two approaches were taken: (1) radioligand binding assays were performed on membrane preparations of purified renal microvessels and glomeruli, with displacement of 125I-[Sar-Ile8]-ANG II by specific non-peptide antagonists of AT (losartan) and AT2 (PD 123319): (2) dose-response curves to ANG II on the isolated perfused kidney were studied. Two weeks of captopril treatment significantly reduced blood pressure (BP) and relative heart weight, and increased plasma renin activity. The binding assays showed that renal microvessels and glomeruli expressed a single receptor population (AT1) for ANG II. The density of glomerular AT1 was not modulated by captopril treatment (600 +/- 174 v 573 +/- 97 fmol/mg protein in non-treated and treated SHR respectively); however. AT1 density on the intrarenal arteries increased 3-fold (55 +/- 20 v 154 +/- 30 fmol/mg protein in non-treated and treated SHR respectively. P < 0.05). Experiments with isolated perfused kidneys demonstrated that captopril did not improve the compliance of intrarenal vessels to high flow but increased their reactivity to ANG II (ED50 = 18 nM v 0.5 pM, P < 0.01). We conclude that treatment with an ACE inhibitor increases vascular reactivity to ANG II which may be mediated by an upregulation of renal vascular ANG II receptors.",

Three additional control dogs were administered ACEI for 28 days. LV mass increased with REC compared to control (146 +/- 6 v 92 +/- 3 g, P < 0.05), was unaffected with ACEI--14, and was decreased with ACEI--28 compared to REC (111 +/- 8 g, P < 0.05). Myocyte function was decreased in REC compared to controls (43 +/- 3 v 63 +/- 3 microns/s, P < 0.05) and was similarly reduced with ACEI--14. However, with ACEI--28, myocyte shortening velocity was increased compared to REC (56 +/- 1 microns/s, P < 0.05). Myocyte beta-adrenergic response was decreased with REC and ACEI--14 compared to controls (53 +/- 9 and 57 +/- 14, respectively v 127 +/- 14 microns/s, P < 0.05). ACEI--28 resulted in a normalization of myocyte beta-adrenergic responsiveness (108 +/- 3 microns/s). LV myocardial ACE activity increased in REC compared to control (5.82 +/- 0.21 v 3.51 +/- 0.15 nmol/mg/min, P < 0.05). With ACEI--14 or ACEI--28, myocardial ACE activity was decreased compared to REC (4.16 +/- 0.06 and 4.08 +/- 0.23 nmol/mg/min; P < 0.05). In control dogs administered ACEI, there were no differences in any of these parameters compared to controls. The unique findings in this study were: (1) effects of ACEI treatment in this model of LV hypertrophy were time dependent with respect to LV mass and LV and myocyte function; and (2) the effect of ACEI treatment on the degree of LV hypertrophy appears to not be solely due modulation of myocardial ACE activity.",

This study compares the efficacy and safety of moexipril plus HCTZ to that of a standard combination treatment in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. After a 1 month placebo run-in period, 140 hypertensive patients whose sitting diastolic BP (DBP) averaged 95-114 mm Hg were randomized to receive either once daily moexipril 7.5 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg or metoprolol 100 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg for the following 12-week double-blind treatment period. At biweekly visits BP was controlled sphygmomanometrically and the occurrence of adverse events (AE) was documented. At study endpoint adjusted mean reductions in sitting systolic/diastolic BP seen with both combinations were -17.6 mm Hg/-12.8 mm Hg and -17.2 mm Hg/-13.9 mm Hg in the moexipril/HCTZ and metoprolol/HCTZ groups, respectively. The response rate to both kinds of combinations were very similar, 69% and 74% in the moexipril/HCTZ and metoprolol/HCTZ groups, respectively. The percentage of patients which experienced one or more AEs were 46% in the moexipril/HCTZ and 61% in the metoprolol/HCTZ group. Headache and cough which are the most frequently reported AEs after treatment with ACE inhibitors were seen in 9% and 10% of the patients in the moexipril/HCTZ group compared to 10% and 4% in the metoprolol/HCTZ group. The study indicates that the combination of moexipril 7.5 mg plus HCTZ 12.5 mg is as efficacious and safe as metoprolol 100 mg plus HCTZ 12.5 mg in the treatment of mild-to-moderate hypertension.", 
    "730": "Erythrocyte membrane fluidity and membrane potential were measured in patients suffering from coronary heart disease (CHD) and treated with perindopril. Membrane fluidity was determined using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, and membrane potential was evaluated using potential-sensitive fluorescent dyes. CHD does not change membrane fluidity at the depth of the 5 carbon in the fatty acid chain of membrane phospholipids. However the hydrophobic core of the membrane is altered in CHD. For 19 CHD patients, the correlation times tau B and tau C of a spin label 16DS were higher than for controls: tau B = (1.84 +/- 0.04) x 10(-9) s and tau C = (2.54 +/- 0.04) x 10(-9) s vs. tau B = (1.62 +/- 0.06) x 10(-9) s; and tau C = (2.24 +/- 0.07) x 10(-9) s (results given as mean +/- SEM). Such results indicate the increased microviscosity in hydrophobic regions of CHD erythrocyte membranes in comparison with controls. Perindopril therapy partly abolished these changes. The membrane potential of CHD red blood cells -17.89 +/- 1.36 mV was higher than the control value -9.83 +/- 0.59 mV. Perindopril treatment shifted the membrane potential value to -13.45 +/- 0.99 mV when measured after a single dose of the drug, or even depolarized the membrane after 7 days of therapy -4.95 +/- 0.73 mV. It is concluded that the erythrocyte membrane is more rigid and hyperpolarized in CHD, and perindopril therapy partly abolishes these changes as early as 3 h after administration.",

Bolus intraarterial injections of synthetic cod [Arg0]BK (0.1-10 nmol/kg) into conscious cod produced an immediate increase in ventral aortic pressure that was of relatively short duration (<5 min) and an increase in heart rate. Cod [Arg0]BK was approximately 10 times more potent than cod BK, and the maximal pressor response produced by the peptide was significantly (P < 0.05) greater. Bolus intra-arterial injections of either mammalian BK or cod des-Arg9,[Arg0]BK, in doses up to 100 nmol/kg, had no effect on pressure or heart rate. The data indicate that the ligand binding properties of the BK receptors in cod are different from those of the mammalian B1- and B2-receptor subtypes. The pressor response to 1 nmol/kg cod [Arg0]BK was reduced (by 51 +/- 6%; P < 0.05) in prasozin-treated fish, whereas in enalapril-treated fish, the response to the peptide was enhanced (by 42 +/- 12%; P < 0.05). The data indicate an involvement of catecholamines but not an activation of the renin-angiotensin system in mediating the vasopressor action of BK in the cod.", 
    "732": "This study was conducted to investigate a possible systemic effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) on tissue antioxidant defenses. CF1 mice (4-mo-old females) were administered either water (control) or water containing enalapril (20 mg/l) or captopril (50 mg/l) during 11 wk. Neither enalapril nor captopril treatment had an effect on body mass or brain, kidney, or heart weight relative to controls. CuZn-superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was increased by enalapril treatment in kidney medulla (27%), heart (24%), and erythrocytes (19%) and by captopril treatment in kidney medulla (43%) and heart (54%) relative to controls. Mn-SOD and catalase activities were unaffected by either treatment. Enalapril, but not captopril treatment, increased Se-glutathione peroxidase activity in renal medulla (19%). Nonenzymatic antioxidant defenses, evaluated by tert-butyl hydroperoxide-initiated chemiluminescence (HICL), were enhanced in kidney cortex (48%) by enalapril and in brain by enalapril (44%) or captopril (36%) treatment relative to controls. As evaluated in vitro by HICL and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances formation, captopril had a free radical scavenger activity, whereas neither enalapril nor lisinopril was effective. These results suggest that ACEi may protect tissues from oxidative damage by increasing enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant defenses."
