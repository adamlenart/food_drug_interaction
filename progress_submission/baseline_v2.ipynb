       "[u'Heart failure still has a significant disease burden with poor outcomes worldwide despite advances in therapy. The standard therapies have been focused on blockade of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers and mineralocorticoid antagonists and the sympathetic nervous system with unk-blockers. The natriuretic peptide system is a potential counter-regulatory system that promotes vasodilatation and natriuresis. Angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors are a new class drug capable of blocking the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and enhancing the natriuretic peptide system to improve neurohormonal balance. The success of the PARADIGM-HF trial with LCZ696 and its approval for heart failure treatment is likely to generate a paradigm shift. This review summarises the current knowledge of LCZ696 with a focus on pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, mechanisms of action, clinical efficacy and safety.',\n",

In the present study, this triple therapy was defined as the best medical treatment. This study was designed to determine the number of patients who received best medical treatment at admission and at discharge from a vascular surgery department. We also examined the number of patients who received adapted medical treatment and every pharmacologic class separately. Finally, we investigated whether there were differences in prescribing rates according to patient characteristics and cardiovascular history, clinical grade of LE-PAD, and the type of surgery practiced.']"
