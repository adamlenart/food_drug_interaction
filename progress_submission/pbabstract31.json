Chart review was conducted on all patients included in the current census as of September 1, 2005; residents were excluded from the analysis if they were discharged or deceased between September 1, 2005, and the date of chart review. CPG adherence was evaluated for the following 7 conditions: diabetes, coronary artery disease (CAD), stroke, heart failure (HF), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoporosis. In addition, the 6 most recent pharmacist recommendations for each patient were classified according to disease state.",

    "5": "We report a case of a male teenager with severe heart and acute renal failure as the dominant clinical manifestations of renovascular hypertension (RVH) caused by atypical giant cell arteritis (GCA). Unrecognized RVH and treatment of the consequent heart failure by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) probably contributed to progression of renovascular disease to bilateral renal artery occlusion. Recurrent \"flash\" pulmonary edemas could not be prevented until surgical revascularization of the only functioning right kidney was achieved by an aortorenal bypass. Prompt post-operative normalization of heart function and arterial hypertension occurred despite the histopathological finding of the resected renal artery compatible with GCA and 4-year duration of significant renovascular disease. At the last check-up, the patient was asymptomatic, with normal arterial pressure on the prescribed treatment: carvedilol, hydrochlorothiazide, prednisolone 20 mg daily and aspirin. Subsequent follow-up is necessary to observe the evolution of GCA as an exceptionally rare cause of RVH.", 
    "6": "Idiopathic nodular glomerulosclerosis (ING) is characterized as diffuse nodular glomerulosclerotic lesions, closely resembling Kimmelstiel-Wilson lesions without diabetic mellitus. We report here three Japanese cases of ING and discuss the previous reports. The patients were 75-, 48- and 84-year-old males with a history of long-term hypertension. Laboratory examination revealed moderate proteinuria and mild renal dysfunction. Diabetes mellitus was excluded by repeated clinical and laboratory investigations. Renal histology revealed nodular glomerulosclerosis, and both afferent and efferent arteriolosclerosis in all patients. In electron microscopy, the glomerular basement membrane was markedly thick in all patients. A low-protein diet and potent anti-hypertensive treatment using angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were initiated in all patients and urinary protein excretion significantly reduced without the progression of renal dysfunction. We reviewed 42 previously reported cases and our three cases. The analysis revealed that common clinical features of ING are being male (82.2%) of relatively advanced age (mean age 61.3 years), with hypertension (82.2%), mild renal dysfunction (mean serum creatinine 2.9 mg/dl) and moderate urinary protein excretion (mean 4.05 g/day). Common histopathological findings of ING are nodular glomerulosclerosis (100%), arterio-arteriolosclerosis (91.2 and 89.7%) and glomerular basement membrane thickening (85.7%). In conclusion, ING is one of the phenotypes of arteriosclerotic renal disease without diabetes mellitus. Severe arterio-arteriolosclerosis may contribute to the progression to glomerular nodular formation in ING. The combination of renin-angiotensin system inhibition and a low protein diet can be beneficial for the reduction of urinary protein excretion.", 
    "7": "Owing to relative inefficacy and side effects of currently available antiarrhythmic drugs, current interest has shifted to treatments that target atrial fibrillation (AF) substrate. It has been suggested that calpain-induced atrial structural remodelling is under the control of renin-angiotensin system during AF. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of cilazapril and valsartan on the mRNA and protein expression of atrial calpains and atrial structural remodelling in AF dogs induced by chronic rapid atrial pacing. Twenty-seven dogs were randomly divided into sham-operated group (n = 6), control group (n = 7), cilazapril group (n = 7) and valsartan group (n = 7). One thin silicon plaque containing 4 pairs of electrodes was sutured to each atrium. A pacemaker was implanted in a subcutaneous pocket and attached to a screw-in epicardial lead in the right atrial appendage. The dogs in control group, cilazapril group and valsartan group were paced at 400 beats per minutes for 6 weeks. The dogs in cilazapril and valsartan groups received cilazapril (1mg x kg(-1)x d(-1)) or valsartan (30mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)) 1 week before rapid atrial pacing until pacing stop respectively. Transthoracic and transoesophageal echocardiographic examinations were performed in order to detect the changes of left atrium volume and contractile function. The inducibility and duration of AF were measured in all the groups. The expressions of atrial calpain I and calpain II mRNA were semi-quantified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The protein levels of calpain I and calpain II in atrial myocardium were measured by Western-blot method. Pathohistological and ultrastructural changes in atrial tissue were tested by light and electron microscopy. Compared with the sham-operated control group, dramatic smaller left atrium and left atrial appendage volumes and significant higher atrial contractile function were observed in the cilazapril and valsartan groups. After 6-week atrial tachy-pacing, the mRNA and protein expressions of calpain I increased dramatically in the control group than that in the sham group, tissue calpain protein expression in all groups significantly correlated with the myolysis (r = 0.89, P < 0.01). Cilazapril and valsartan could significantly inhibit the gene and protein expressions of calpain I. No differences were found in the expression of calpain II mRNA and protein between the groups. Compared with atrial myocytes obtained from sham dogs, atrial myocytes from the control group dogs showed a reduced number of sarcomeres, a significant higher myolytic area of atria (24.3% vs. 3.1%, P < 0.01), increased vacuolization and dissolution. Cilazapril and valsartan could effectively prevent the pathohistological and ultrastructural changes induced by chronic rapid atrial pacing, dramatically decrease the area of myolysis (P < 0.05) and significantly reduce the inducibility and duration of AF. The expression of calpain I mRNA and protein increased remarkably in AF dogs. Cilazapril and valsartan can inhibit calpain I up-regulation, suppress atrial structural remodeling, and prevent the induction and promotion of AF in chronic rapid atrial pacing dogs.",

The autoradiographic observations concerning FBL binding were confirmed by ACE and AT1R immunoreactivity. Distribution of mast cell chymase differed from ACE, as a higher number of mast cells was present in the remote, noninfarcted myocardium than in the periinfarcted myocardium (5.1 +/- 3.2 vs. 3.2 +/- 2.2 mast cells per field, P < 0.001).

The quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) method is the first statistical learning methods successfully used for predicting various classes of cardiovascular and hematological agents. In recent years, more sophisticated statistical learning methods have been explored for predicting cardiovascular and hematological agents particularly those of diverse structures that might not be straightforwardly modelled by single QSAR models. These methods include partial least squares, multiple linear regressions, linear discriminant analysis, k-nearest neighbour, artificial neural networks and support vector machines. Their application potential has been exhibited in the prediction of various classes of cardiovascular and hematological agents including 1, 4-dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, thrombin inhibitors, AchE inhibitors, HERG potassium channel inhibitors and blockers, potassium channel openers, platelet aggregation inhibitors, protein kinase inhibitors, dopamine antagonists and torsade de pointes causing agents.

    "22": "Although different treatment modalities have been implemented for pulmonary fibrosis, the results have not been promising and these conditions have been considered untreatable and irreversible. Thus, a plethora of new drugs has been tried for the control of this condition in recent years. This study examined the effects of two angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, captopril and enalapril, on paraquat-induced pulmonary fibrosis in rats, through biochemical and histopathological parameters. Male albino Wistar rats were divided into eight groups (n = 4-5 each), including control, paraquat, captopril alone, captopril treatment and pre-treatment, enalapril alone, enalapril treatment and pre-treatment. After 21 days of treatment, the lungs were removed and the levels of hydroxyproline, glutathione and lipid peroxidation were determined. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors showed no effect on glutathione and lipid peroxidation. The results also demonstrated that captopril and enalapril improved pulmonary fibrosis as shown by histopathology, as well as a decreased content of hydroxyproline (P < 0.001) in the lung tissue. In conclusion, the present findings suggest that the antifibrotic effect of these drugs may be related to the inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme.",

    "32": "Pharmacologic therapy to alleviate symptoms in chronic angina has been enhanced by the recent approval of several novel compounds that complement the traditional approach using beta-adrenergic blocking drugs, calcium antagonists, and long-acting nitrates. In the United States, ranolazine, a drug that inhibits late I(Na), was approved for patients with chronic angina that remain symptomatic on beta-blockers, calcium antagonists, or long-acting nitrates, on the basis of an acceptable safety profile and efficacy in several randomized placebo controlled studies. A slight increase in the QT interval is observed (<10 ms on average) at the maximum approved dose of 1,000 mg twice daily. Therefore, an ECG should be acquired at baseline and during follow-up, and the drug should not be used in patients with QT prolongation or those who are on QT prolonging drugs unless longer term randomized outcome data demonstrates no excess risk. The MERLIN trial of non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE ACS) randomized 6,560 patients to assess the potential benefit of ranolazine in reducing the composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and recurrent ischemia, with results expected in 2007. In Europe, ivabradine, a drug that inhibits the hyperpolarization-activated mixed sodium/potassium inward I(f) current, which slows the rest and exercise heart rate, was approved in 2005. Ivabradine at a dose of 10 mg twice daily has been shown to have similar efficacy to amlodipine 10 mg once daily or atenolol 100 mg once daily in alleviating chronic angina symptoms. In this review, several other novel investigational approaches are presented and patient selection considerations for the most recent approved drugs for chronic angina are discussed.", 
    "33": "Ischemic heart disease is the foremost cause of death in the United States and the developed countries. Stable angina is the initial manifestation of ischemic heart disease in one half of the patients and becomes a recurrent symptom in survivors of myocardial infarction (MI) and other forms of acute coronary syndromes (ACS). There are multiple therapeutic modalities currently available for treatment of anginal symptoms in patients with stable CAD. These include anti-anginal drugs and myocardial revascularization procedures such as coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABGS), percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Anti-anginal drug therapy is based on treatment with nitrates, beta blockers, and calcium channel blockers. A newly approved antianginal drug, ranolazine, is undergoing phase III evaluation. Not infrequently, combination therapy is often necessary for adequate symptom control in some patients with stable angina. However, there has not been a systematic evaluation of individual or combination antianginal drug therapy on hard clinical end points in patients with stable angina. Most revascularization trials that have evaluated treatment with CABGS, PTCA, or PCI in patients with chronic CAD and stable angina have not shown significant improvement in survival or decreased incidence of non-fatal MI compared to medical treatment. In the CABGS trials, various post-hoc analyses have identified several smaller subgroups at high-risk in whom CABGS might improve clinical outcomes. However, there are conflicting findings in different reports and these findings are further compromised due to the heterogeneous groups of patients in these trials. Moreover, no prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT) has confirmed an advantage of CABGS, compared to medical treatment, in reduction of hard clinical outcomes in any of the high-risk subgroups. Based on the available data, it appears reasonable to conclude that for most patients (except perhaps in those with presence of left main disease > 50% stenosis) there is no apparent survival benefit of CABGS compared to medical therapy in stable CAD patients with angina. Although these trial have reported better symptom control associated with the revascularization intervention in most patients, this has not been adequately compared using modern medical therapies. Available data from recent studies also suggest treatment with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), a statin and a regular exercise regimen in patients with stable CAD and angina pectoris.",

Although there was no association of individual SNPs in the AGTR1 gene, there was a graded response between common haplotypes and systolic BP reduction in the order of haplotype 2 (H2)/lack of haplotype 3 (non-H3) (-13.6 mm Hg) > non-H2/non-H3 (-10.9 mm Hg) > H3/non-H2 (-6.6 mm Hg) (P=0.004).

The mediator responsible for the effect of EDHF is unknown. In epineurial arterioles, C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) has properties consistent with EDHF-like activity. Epineurial arterioles express CNP, and exogenous CNP causes a concentration-dependent vascular relaxation. In streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, CNP-mediated vascular relaxation in epineurial arterioles is decreased. Since CNP may be a regulator of vascular function, a vasopeptidase inhibitor may be an effective treatment for diabetes-induced vascular and neural disease. Vasopeptidase inhibitors inhibit ACE activity and neutral endopeptidase, which degrades natriuretic peptides. Streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats were treated with AVE7688 (450 mg/kg in the diet), a vasopeptidase inhibitor, for 8-10 weeks after 4 weeks of untreated diabetes. Treatment of diabetic rats corrected the diabetes-induced decrease in endoneurial blood flow, significantly improved motor and sensory nerve conduction velocity, prevented the development of hypoalgesia in the hind paw, and reduced superoxide and nitrotyrosine levels in epineurial arterioles. The diabetes-induced decrease in acetylcholine-mediated vascular relaxation by epineurial arterioles was significantly improved with treatment. These studies suggest that vasopeptidase inhibitors may be an effective approach for the treatment of diabetic vascular and neural dysfunction.", 
    "50": "Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) is an endogenous nitric oxide (NO) inhibitor recognized as an independent risk factor for endothelial dysfunction and coronary heart diseases. This study investigated whether ADMA (10 mg/kg day for 14 days) affected endothelial function and aggravated post-ischemic ventricular dysfunction in the perfused rat heart. Systolic blood pressure and heart rate, plasma levels of ADMA and nitrite/nitrate were measured in vehicle- and ADMA-treated rats. Perfused hearts were submitted to global ischemia-reperfusion and vascular endothelial dysfunction was examined with angiotensin II in coronary vessels and aortic rings. Endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) mRNA expression in aortic and cardiac tissues were measured. ADMA-treated rats had higher systolic blood pressure (1.3-fold, P<0.01) and slower heart rate (16%, P<0.05) than controls. Plasma ADMA rose (1.9-fold, P<0.01) and nitrite/nitrate concentration decreased 59% (P<0.001). Ventricular contraction (stiffness) increased significantly, with worsening of post-ischemic ventricular dysfunction. In preparations from ADMA-treated rats the coronary vasculature's response to angiotensin II was almost doubled (P<0.01) and the maximal vasorelaxant effect of acetylcholine in aortic rings was significantly lower than in preparations from vehicle-treated rats. In cardiac and aortic tissues eNOS mRNA and ACE mRNA levels were similar in controls and ADMA-treated rats. The increased plasma levels of ADMA presumably cause endothelial dysfunction because of a deficiency in NO production, which also appears involved in the aggravation of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury.",

The correlation between global recovery and global CR was r=0.55, p=0.007. In a multivariate logistic regression, including global and regional CR, age, gender, etiology of heart failure, ACE-inhibitor treatment, heart rate, and baseline EF, only basal CR was independently associated with recovery, OR 1.07 [95% CI, 1.01-1.21], p=0.019.", 
    "54": "The strongest association for prediction of LV recovery after metoprolol treatment was found regarding function of basal segments of the ventricle.

    "55": "Angiotensin (Ang)-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are widely used for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Not all patients respond to ACE inhibitors, and it has been suggested that genetic variation might be a useful marker to predict the therapeutic efficacy of these drugs. In particular, the ACE insertion (I)/deletion (D) polymorphism has been investigated in this regard. Despite a decade of intensive research involving the genotyping of thousands of patients, we still do not know whether ACE genotyping helps in predicting the success of ACE inhibition. This review critically addresses the concept that predictive information on therapeutic efficacy of ACE inhibitors might be obtained based on ACE genotyping. It answers the following questions: Do higher ACE levels really result in higher Ang II levels? Is ACE the only converting enzyme in humans? Does ACE inhibition affect ACE expression? Why does ACE have 2 catalytically active domains? What is the relevance of ACE inhibitor-induced signaling through membrane-bound ACE? The review ends with the proposal that ACE phenotyping may prove to be a better first step toward personalized medicine for ACE inhibitors than ACE genotyping.",

Overall, the risk of cardiac mortality is 10-fold to 20-fold greater in dialysis patients than in age and sex-matched controls without chronic kidney disease. The aim of this paper is to review critically the evidence that cardiac outcomes in dialysis patients are modified by cardiovascular risk factor interventions. There is limited, but as yet inconclusive controlled trial evidence that cardiovascular outcomes in dialysis populations may be improved by antioxidants (vitamin E or acetylcysteine), ensuring that hemoglobin levels do not exceed 120 g/L (especially in the setting of known cardiovascular disease), prescribing carvedilol in the setting of dilated cardiomyopathy, and by using cinacalcet in uncontrolled secondary hyperparathyroidism. Similarly, there are a number of negative controlled trials, which have demonstrated that statins, high-dose folic acid, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, multiple risk factor intervention via multidisciplinary clinics, and high-dose or high-flux dialysis are ineffective in preventing cardiovascular disease. Although none of these studies could be considered conclusive, the negative trials to date should raise significant concerns about the heavy reliance of current clinical practice guidelines on extrapolation of findings from cardiovascular intervention trials in the general population. It may be that cardiovascular disease in dialysis populations is less amenable to intervention, either because of the advanced stage of chronic kidney disease or because the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease in dialysis patients is different from that in the general population. Large, well-conducted, multicenter randomized-controlled trials in this area are urgently required.",

    "61": "Large clinical trials have shown that inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) can delay and/or prevent the onset of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in high-risk individuals, such as those with hypertension or chronic heart failure. Moreover, a meta-analysis of these randomized clinical studies concluded that the mean weighted relative risk of development of T2DM was reduced by 25% in those patients treated with angiotensin II receptor blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. In spite of these firm clinical data, the mechanistic pathways mediating the protective activity of RAS blockade have yet to be resolved. Of particular interest is the recently identified local pancreatic RAS and, perhaps more importantly, the finding that it is up-regulated in animal models of T2DM. This putative local RAS may regulate pancreatic islet blood flow, oxygen tension, and islet (pro)insulin biosynthesis. It might also mediate the generation of reactive oxygen species, thereby causing oxidative stress-induced pancreatic beta-cell apoptosis and fibrosis. Moreover, findings that RAS blockade improved beta-cell secretory function and cell mass in experimental animal models of Type 2 diabetes indicate that inhibition of RAS activation may play a pivotal role in protecting islet cell function, and furthermore may prevent the development of overt T2DM. Such data supporting the involvement of the local pancreatic RAS in islet function, as well as a causal relationship between RAS activation and T2DM, and RAS induced beta-cell dysfunction, mandate further investigation into the role of RAS in the pathogenesis of the progressive islet impairment observed in patients with T2DM.", 
    "62": "Approximately two-third of the cases of the adult nephrotic syndrome is caused by a primary glomerular disease, while the remaining one-third is caused by diabetes mellitus, autoimmune diseases, or amyloidosis. There are two different therapies to treat the syndrome: a general and a special treatment. The general treatment includes administering an appropriate diet (reduced intake of proteins and salt), use of diuretics and lipid-lowering drugs (primarily statins) and initiation of anticoagulant treatment, if required. It is generally necessary to administer angiotensin-convertase-enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers as well as initiate a symptomatic treatment to mitigate the loss of special binding-proteins. The special treatment involves the administration of immunosuppressive and cytostatic drugs. This therapy can be initiated only after the evaluation of renal histology and the overall risk status of the patient. Steroids are still the basic immunosuppressive drugs. Their use can be supplemented with other immunosuppressive or cytostatic treatment. In therapy resistant cases, however, new drugs like mycophenolate mofetil or rituximab can also be applied.", 
    "63": "Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease. Lifelong environmental factors (eg, salt intake, obesity, alcohol) and genetic factors clearly contribute to the development of hypertension, but it has also been established that stress in utero may program the later development of the disease. This phenomenon, known as fetal programming can be modeled in a range of experimental animal models. In maternal low protein diet rat models of programming, administration of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor antagonists in early life can prevent development of hypertension, thus implicating the renin-angiotensin system in this process. Here we show that in this model, expression of the AT(1b) angiotensin receptor gene in the adrenal gland is upregulated by the first week of life resulting in increased receptor protein expression consistent with the increased adrenal angiotensin responsiveness observed by others. Furthermore, we show that the proximal promoter of the AT(1b) gene in the adrenal is significantly undermethylated, and that in vitro, AT(1b) gene expression is highly dependent on promoter methylation. These data suggest a link between fetal insults to epigenetic modification of genes and the resultant alteration of gene expression in adult life leading ultimately to the development of hypertension. It seems highly probable that similar influences may be involved in the development of human hypertension.",

The incidence of severe hyperkalaemic episodes (>6.0 mmol/l) upon monthly predialysis serum K determination was 25.8% with no exposure to RAS blockades, 29.8% for ACEI alone, 19.6% for ARB alone and 17.7% for ACEI+ARB combination without statistically significant differences among the four periods (P=NS). Among covariables, the degree of Kt/V, intakes of other medications interfering with potassium homeostasis and diabetes mellitus did not result in any significant hyperkalaemic changes during the 3-month study period except anuric patients compared with non-anuric patients (5.58+/-0.69 vs 5.19+/-0.65 mmol/l, P<0.001).",

    "73": "Disulfide S-monoxide (DSMO) and disulfide S-dioxide (DSDO) have been proposed as proximal mediators for the oxidant-mediated modification of proteins. These disulfide S-oxides (DSOs) derived from glutathione (GSH) and captopril (CPSH) were synthesized by iron- or methyltrioxorhenium (VII)-catalyzed oxidation of the thiols with H2O2. Treatment of mouse hippocampal extracts with [35S]GS-DSOs revealed that a large number of proteins were susceptible to thionylation; however, only a limited number of the them were detectable by the commonly used antibody against GS-associated proteins. Using protein kinase C (PKC) as a model, we found that DSOs derived from different thiols modified this kinase with different efficacy and specificity; for example, the inhibitory potency of the kinase was glutathione disulfide S-dioxide (GS-DSDO) (IC50, approximately 30 microM) > captopril disulfide S-dioxide (CPS-DSDO) (IC50, approximately 450 microM) > glutathione disulfide S-monoxide (GS-DSMO) and captopril disulfide S-monoxide (CPS-DSMO). The stoichiometries of thionylation of PKC beta mediated by [35S]GS-DSMO and [35S]GS-DSDO were approximately 1 and 5 mol/mol, respectively, and at least four glutathionylation sites were identified in the GS-DSDO-treated kinase. Modification of PKC by GS-DSDO and CPS-DSDO rendered the kinase very susceptible to limited proteolysis; the former preferentially caused the degradation of the catalytic and the latter the regulatory domain of the kinase. Furthermore, CPS-DSDO-mediated modification of PKC increased the autonomous kinase activity; this was not the case for GS-DSDO-mediated modification. Since DSOs of different oxidative states as well as those derived from different thiols exert different effects on a target protein, these molecules could cause distinct cellular responses if derived from endogenous cellular reactions or even if they arise from exogenous sources.", 
    "74": "Endothelial function in elderly hypertensive patients with arteriosclerosis obliterans has not been evaluated. We examined whether antihypertensive drugs improve vasodilatory response to reactive hyperemia of the limbs in elderly hypertensive patients (83 +/- 8 [SD] years) without (n=46, 0.9 < or = ankle-brachial pressure index < or = 1.4) and with (n=24) arteriosclerosis obliterans (ankle-brachial pressure index < 0.2). Patients were randomized for treatment with monotherapy of either temocapril (14 with and 26 without arteriosclerosis obliterans) or amlodipine (10 with and 20 without arteriosclerosis obliterans) for 6 months. Blood flows of the forearms and legs were measured by strain-gauge plethysmography. The vasodilatory response to the release of compression of the forearms and thighs at 200 mmHg or 20 mmHg more than systolic blood pressure for 5 min and to sublingual administration of nitroglycerin (0.3 mg) was assessed. The maximum reactive hyperemic flow in 35 legs with arteriosclerosis obliterans was significantly (p < 0.001) decreased compared to the value in legs in the control hypertensive subjects. Moreover, maximum reactive hyperemic flow in the forearms of patients with arteriosclerosis obliterans was significantly (p = 0.002) decreased compared to that in the control subjects. Blood pressure was similarly decreased by treatment with temocapril or amlodipine. Response to nitroglycerin (0.3 mg) was not changed by either drug. Treatment with temocapril significantly improved maximum reactive hyperemic flow of not only the legs and forearms in control hypertensives but also the legs and forearms in patients with arteriosclerosis obliterans, and attenuated the worsening of activity of daily living in these patients, although treatment with amlodipine did not. These results suggest that the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor temocapril has a beneficial effect on endothelial function in elderly patients with arteriosclerosis obliterans.",

Of primary importance among these studies were the three trials of the CHARM program comparing candesartan and placebo in patients with chronic heart failure. In CHARM-Alternative, candesartan significantly reduced the risk of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure in patients who could not tolerate angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. This risk was also significantly lowered by candesartan in CHARM-Added, which included patients who were already on ACE inhibitor therapy. At borderline significance, the risk of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure was reduced by candesartan in CHARM-Preserved, which included patients who presented with preserved systolic function and left ventricular ejection fraction. Candesartan also significantly reduced the risk of new-onset diabetes and of atrial fibrillation in the CHARM-Overall study.",

Imidapril (5 mg/d, n = 6), enalapril (2.5 mg/d, n = 6), or quinapril (2.5 mg/d, n = 6) was given for at least 8 weeks prior to the trial. During dialysis, enalaprilat, but not imidaprilat or quinaprilat, concentrations in both sides decreased significantly. Compared to enalaprilat, the dialyzabilities of imidaprilat and quinaprilat were significantly lower (dialyzer clearance [mL/min/m(2)]: enalaprilat, 41.8 +/- 7.4; imidaprilat, 19.0 +/- 7.8; quinaprilat, 8.9 +/- 1.3). The dialyzabilities of the 3 drugs were negatively correlated with their respective protein-binding rates. During hemodialysis, blood pressure did not change significantly in any group.

    "77": "Melanoidins formed at the last stage of the Maillard reaction have been pointed out to possess certain functional properties. Potential antihypertensive activity of food melanoidins (coffee, beer, and sweet-wine) has been evaluated according to in-vitro ACE-inhibitory activity. Precision of the assay (3.2% of coefficient of variation, n = 10) for melanoidins is similar to those reported of well-known antihypertensive peptides. Assay was applied on food melanoidins obtained from coffee (three roasting degrees), beer, and sweet-wine. All samples showed in-vitro ACE-inhibitory activity. The activity in coffee melanoidins was significantly higher at more severe heating conditions. These experiments demonstrate that food melanoidins could inhibit ACE activity. In-vitro ACE-inhibitory activity of coffee melanoidins is likely located within the melanoidin structure. But ACE-inhibitory activity is also partly due to the low-molecular-weight compound nonchemically bound to the melanoidin structure, then melanoidins can act as carrier-protecting agents. These compounds could be naturally phenolic compounds present in the green beans or intermediary Maillard reaction products with antihypertensive activity.",

We conducted this study using data from the Ingenix Research Datamart, which includes insurance claims for reimbursement for medical services and prescription medications for approximately 8,000,000 members of a large nationally dispersed health plan. We used claims for pharmacy dispensings of prescription medications to identify all women aged 10-59 years old who initiated EE/DRSP or other OCs during the first 3 years of EE/DRSP availability (July 2001 to June 2004).

More than 98% of surveyed physicians were aware of the potassium-sparing property of EE/DRSP. Compared with physicians whose patients had potassium tests, physicians of patients without such tests were more likely to disagree with the recommendation for users of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, heparin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Patient barriers and health plan restrictions were other factors possibly contributing to noncompliance.", 
    "81": "This study demonstrates incomplete physician compliance with a labeling recommendation of potassium monitoring for initiators of EE/DRSP receiving concomitant therapy predisposing to hyperkalemia.

Coronary blood flow was assessed using corrected thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) frame counts (CTFC). During reperfusion, there was a significant increase in sL-selectin, sP-selectin and ET-1 in the placebo group, which was greatly diminished by enalaprilat. Levels of sVCAM-1 and sICAM-1 were not affected in either group. CTFC in the placebo group remained higher than normal in both the IRA and nonculprit vessels, whereas myocardial blood flow improved with enalaprilat.",

A number of proteases have been reported as capable of degrading Abeta, among them: neprilysin, insulin-degrading enzyme, endothelin-converting enzyme-1 and -2, angiotensin-converting enzyme and plasmin. These proteases, originating from a variety of cell types, degrade Abeta of various conformational states and in different cellular locations. We report here the isolation of a serine protease from serum-free conditioned medium of human neuroblastoma cells. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS)-based sequencing of the isolated protein identified acyl peptide hydrolase (APH; EC3.4.19.1) as the active peptidase. APH is one of four members of the prolyl oligopeptidase family of serine proteases expressed in a variety of cells and tissues, including erythrocytes, liver and brain, but its precise biological activity is unknown. Here, we describe the identification of APH as an Abeta-degrading enzyme, and we show that the degradation of Abeta by APH isolated from transfected cells is inhibited by APH-specific inhibitors, as well as by synthetic Abeta peptide. In addition, we cloned APH from human brain and from neuroblastoma cells. Most importantly, our results indicate that APH expression in AD brain is lower than in age-matched controls.", 
    "86": "Primary aldosteronism (PA) is a form of surgically curable secondary hypertension. The prevalence of PA among hypertensive patients is reportedly between 5 and 15% and hypokalemia is rare in patients with PA. Therefore, hypertensives should be screened for PA. The aldosterone (PAC)-renin activity (PRA) ratio (ARR) has widely been used as the initial screening for PA; however, it is reported that the diagnosis of PA should not be based on the finding of a raised ARR. We compared the sensitivity and specificity of ARR for PA screening with those of PAC and PRA in 236 hypertensives, and ROC analysis revealed that PAC and PRA are more sensitive and specific than ARR for PA screening. The sensitivity and specificity of the captopril suppression test, furosemide plus upright test and ACTH stimulation test for secondary screening for PA were retrospectively examined in 94 patients with PA and 44 patients without PA. ROC analysis demonstrated that the ACTH stimulation test was the most sensitive and specific among these three tests. Therefore, we propose that hypertensives should initially be screened for PA using the criteria of PAC > or = 12.0 ng/dl and PRA < or = 1.0 ng/ml/h and should be secondarily screened using the ACTH stimulation test. Then ACTH-stimulated adrenal venous sampling should be performed in patients with the ratio of maximal PAC to cortisol after ACTH stimulation 0.85. Patients with unilateral secretion of aldosterone2 1400 ng/dl should undergo unilateral adrenalectomy and patients with bilateral secretion of aldosterone2 1400 ng/dl should be treated with antihypertensive agents.",

We aim to determine if these recommendations had been applied in practice for acute and chronic stable heart failure, and what difficulties there might be. Data from 80 consecutive patients hospitalized for decompensated heart failure ('acute') between May and July 2003 were analyzed at admission, upon discharge and at 12 weeks follow-up; along with 74 cardiology clinic out-patients with stable congestive heart failure ('chronic'- no decompensation or admission in previous six months). Less than half of study patients with prior left ventricular dysfunction were on ACE-inhibitors (47%), diuretics (39%), ATII antagonists, spironolactone or digoxin (5% each). All 'acute' patients were commenced on diuretics and ACE-inhibitors in hospital. Six patients died or transferred to another center. Compliance with clinic appointment at 12 weeks was 85% despite telephone reminders. Drug prescription at 12 weeks was significantly lower for diuretics and ACE-inhibitors compared to prescription at discharge (all p < 0.05) but higher compared to patients with chronic HF. Diuretics and ACE inhibitors remain under-utilized for patients with recurrent heart failure. Use of spironolactone and beta-blocker is slow due to limited medical experience and funding. Clinic non-attendance is significant and due to patient factors.",

    "89": "We undertook a systematic review up to Sept 15, 2006, and identified 48 randomised groups of 22 clinical trials with 143,153 participants who did not have diabetes at randomisation and so were eligible for inclusion in our analysis. 17 trials enrolled patients with hypertension, three enrolled high-risk patients, and one enrolled those with heart failure. The main outcome was the proportion of patients who developed diabetes.", 
    "90": "Initial drug therapy used in the trials (and the number of patients with diabetes of the total number at risk) included: an ARB (1189 of 14,185, or 8.38%), ACE inhibitor (1618 of 22,941, or 7.05%), calcium-channel blocker (CCB, 2791 of 38,607, or 7.23%), placebo (1686 of 24,767, or 6.81%), beta blocker (2705 of 35,745, or 7.57%), or diuretic (998 of 18,699, or 5.34%). With an initial diuretic as the standard of comparison (eight groups), the degree of incoherence (a measure of how closely the entire network fits together) was small (omega=0.000017, eight degrees of freedom). The odds ratios were: ARB (five groups) 0.57 (95% CI 0.46-0.72, p<0.0001); ACE inhibitor (eight groups) 0.67 (0.56-0.80, p<0.0001); CCB (nine groups): 0.75 (0.62-0.90, p=0.002); placebo (nine groups) 0.77 (0.63-0.94, p = 0.009); beta blocker (nine groups) 0.90 (0.75-1.09, p=0.30). These estimates changed little in many sensitivity analyses.",

    "92": "Among the general heart failure (HF) population, over half have diastolic HF (DHF). The proportion of DHF increases with age, from 46% in patients younger than 45 years to 59% in patients older than 85 years. The diagnosis of DHF is made by the combination of signs and symptoms of HF with preserved systolic function (left ventricular ejection fraction >50%), and evidence of diastolic dysfunction obtained by echocardiographic Doppler examination, invasive hemodynamic evaluation, or an elevation of serum B-type natriuretic peptide. The most common risk factors for the development of diastolic dysfunction and DHF include long-standing hypertension, older age, female sex, obesity, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and coronary artery disease. Acute decompensation occurs in the setting of pressure overload, volume overload, or superimposed cardiac ischemia. The cornerstones of in-hospital management include blood pressure and volume control, heart rate control, and correction of precipitating factors. Priorities in the outpatient clinic include optimal blood pressure control, maintenance of euvolemia with minimal or no diuretics, and, potentially, use of disease-modifying drugs including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, aldosterone receptor blockers, beta-blockers, and digoxin. Long-term regression of left ventricular hypertrophy, improvement in diastolic filling parameters, and sustained reductions in B-type natriuretic peptide may be future treatment targets for this condition.", 
    "93": "Chronic lead nephropathy occurs as a result of years of lead exposure. Nowadays, with the induction of high standards for industrial hygiene, symptomatic lead intoxication has become extremely rare. We report a case of chronic lead nephropathy in a 59-year-old man who worked in a battery-recycling unit and was diagnosed with plumbism during a regular health screening few years ago. The diagnosis was suggested by the following findings: serum creatinine 160 microg/L, creatinine clearance 46 ml/min, daily urine protein excretion 0.1 g, uric acid 9.7 mg/dl, blood lead 9.2 microg/dl, and a urinary excretion of 850 microg lead/72 h after a mobilisation test by a Na2-Ca-EDTA chelating agent. Renal ultrasound showed bilateral borderline small kidneys. The kidney biopsy revealed moderate focal atrophy, loss of proximal tubules, and prominent interstitial fibrosis. The patient was prescribed angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors to slow the progression of renal insufficiency and control the blood pressure. Hyperuricemia was also treated and controlled. During the regular follow-up, renal function remained stable with no proteinuria. A high index of suspicion for lead intoxication in chronic kidney disease patients should be practiced, especially in patients with hyperuricemia. Chelation of lead urinary excretion is helpful in the diagnosis of this disease.", 
    "94": "In spite of recent therapeutic advances, chronic heart failure is a frequent cause of hospitalisation and death. Inhibition of arginine vasopressin is a new, promising treatment option. We here present an overview of how vasopressin antagonists are used in chronic heart failure.", 
    "95": "This article is based on a review of relevant literature found by searching Google and PubMed and studies of reference lists in identified articles.", 
    "96": "In chronic heart failure, different neurohormonal systems are activated. Inhibition of these by beta-adrenergic blockers, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers and aldosterone inhibitors improve prognosis and reduce hospital admissions. Fluid retention and oedema are usually controlled with loop diuretics, but this treatment does probably not improve the prognosis and is potentially harmful. On the other hand, inhibition of arginine vasopressin seems to have no harmful haemodynamic consequences and may theoretically represent a step forward. As opposed to traditional diuretics, vasopressin antagonists increase excretion of free water without causing loss of electrolytes or reduced renal function. Studies in animals and the early human studies are promising. Ongoing phase III studies will hopefully clarify whether arginine vasopressin inhibition can reduce morbidity and mortality in heart failure.", 
    "97": "The Working Group on Heart Failure of the Norwegian Society of Cardiology here presents a revised programme for the treatment of congestive heart failure. Possible surgical and percutaneous interventions should be considered, and non- pharmacological measures taken as indicated for each patient. ACE-inhibitors are the first-line pharmacological therapy in heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (< 40%). Possible adverse effects on blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes necessitate close monitoring of these variables. Beta-blockers should be considered in patients with symptomatic heart failure. If ACE-inhibitors are not tolerated, an angiotensin- II-blocker can be the added. Diuretics should only be used as adjunctive therapy to ACE-inhibitors. Aldosterone antagonists have a proven effect on survival, but close monitoring of potassium levels is imperative. Especially in the elderly, the renal function and level of electrolytes must be monitored closely. Device therapy, such ac cardiac resynchronization therapy and implantable cardioverter defibrillators, are only indicated for selected patients. ACE-inhibitors, diuretics and beta-blockers are the drugs-of-choice for patients with congestive heart failure with preserved systolic function. Health care for patients with congestive heart failure must be well organized on different levels of care and with multidisciplinary teams involved. The goal is to reduce morbidity and mortality in the heart failure population. This programme is meant for primary, secondary and third line health care providers in Norway.", 
    "98": "Nitric oxide (NO) derived from endothelial NO synthase (NOS) (eNOS) has been identified as a trigger for the second window of protection (SWOP), but its role as a mediator during the SWOP is a matter of debate. Eighteen mongrel dogs were chronically instrumented to measure left ventricular function, coronary blood flow, and wall thickening. Myocardial preconditioning was induced by 10 min coronary artery occlusion. After 24 h of reperfusion (during the SWOP), the hearts were excised. Coronary microvessels were isolated and incubated in presence of 1) the endothelium-dependent agonists carbachol and bradykinin, 2) the calcium ionophore A23187, and 3) the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors enalaprilat and ramiprilat. Nitrite, a metabolite of NO, was measured. Under baseline conditions, nitrite production in microvessels from SWOP was 30% higher than that from normal (96 +/- 4 vs. 74 +/- 3 pmol/mg, P < 0.01, respectively). Nitrite production in response to carbachol, bradykinin, and A23187 was also enhanced in microvessels from SWOP (P < 0.05). These enhanced responses were abolished by N(G)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME) or the endothelial receptor-specific antagonists atropine and HOE-140. The level of eNOS protein in the SWOP myocardium was twofold higher than that in the non-SWOP myocardium. Nitrite production in response to the ACE inhibitors was greater in microvessels from SWOP. These effects were blocked by l-NAME, HOE-140, or dichloroisocoumarin (which inhibits kinin formation). We found that a brief ischemic episode induced delayed, enhanced NO production in coronary microvessels and an upregulation of eNOS protein. These findings suggest that eNOS is a mediator during the SWOP. The ability of ACE inhibitors to enhance NO release during the SWOP points to an additional clinical application for these drugs.",

Lung injury and inflammation were measured by the lung injury score, protein leakage, myeloperoxidase activity, pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activity. Expression of the RAS components was also assessed. Some rats were pretreated with the ACE inhibitor captopril (10 mg/kg) for 3 days or received a concomitant infusion with losartan or PD123319 (type 1 or type 2 angiotensin II receptor antagonist) during mechanical ventilation to assess possible protective effects on VILI.",

    "106": "Heart failure (HF) is a prevalent and morbid chronic disease that patients experience in stages. Progression through the stages of HF can be slowed with optimal medical therapy. Although HF remains a clinical diagnosis made at the bedside, measurement of serum brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) can help in the diagnosis when there is uncertainty. The initial workup for patients with newly diagnosed HF is directed at identifying the underlying cause of left ventricular dysfunction. An assessment of hemodynamic status, determined by a careful physical examination, can be used to direct therapy. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and beta blockers remain the two most important therapies for patients with chronic HF. Aldosterone antagonists improve mortality but require close monitoring for severe hyperkalemia. Angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) are excellent alternatives to ACEIs for ACEI-intolerant patients. Digoxin, a second line agent in HF, improves symptoms without mortality benefit. Successful management of HF requires aggressive management of comorbid conditions and careful follow up to slow disease progression, optimize functional status, and improve longevity.",

Although 83 % of the patients claimed to be absolutely compliant concerning their medication, the Morisky-Score revealed a high compliance only in 52 %. The compliance decreased significantly if the number of prescribed medication increased to more than four pills a day. 48 % of the patients took regularly non-prescription products, 35 % more than three additional products daily. Most commonly multivitamins, minerals, herbals and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were used. This non-prescription medication did not affect the compliance of the patients.",

This article reviews actually known pathways of angiotensin II (Ang II) and other peptides of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) production and their physiological significance. The various carboxy- and aminopeptidases generate a range of peptides, like Ang II, Ang III, Ang IV, Ang-(1-7) and Ang-(1-9) possessing their own and known biological activity. In this issue especially the alternative pathways of Ang II synthesis involving enzymes other than angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) are discussed. We present many evidences for the significance of a new pathway of Ang II production. It has been clearly shown that Ang I may be converted to Ang-(1-9) by angiotensin-converting enzyme-related carboxypeptidase (ACE-2) and then into Ang II in some tissues, but the enzymes responsible for this process are unknown till now. Although there are many data proving the existence of alternative pathways of Ang II production, we can still block only ACE and angiotensin receptor 1 (AT(1)) in clinical practice. It seems that a lot needs to be done before we can wildly complexively control RAS and treat more effectively cardiovascular disorders such as hypertension or heart failure.",

The connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), a new growth factor with multi-function, has an important role in fibrosis of tissue and organs. It has been demonstrated that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) can prevent the development of cardiomyocyte from remodeling and improve cardiac function. Researchers try to test the hypothesis that cardiac function improvement attributable to ACEI is associated with inhibiting expression of CTGF in patients with HF.

Subsequently, in patients with A1C > 7%; blood pressure >130/80 mmHg; LDL cholesterol levels >100 mg/dl; or microalbuminuria, we evaluated the status of management for those cardiovascular risk factors. Physicians were most likely to measure A1C levels (98.6%), but less likely to measure microalbuminuria (56.2%), LDL cholesterol (73.7%), or blood pressure (74.4%). Patients whose A1C levels were above the goal (78.2%) were likely to receive optimal therapy. In contrast, only 21.1% of patients with uncontrolled blood pressure and 5.3% of patients with LDL cholesterol levels above the target range received optimal management. Of the 36 patients with microalbuminuria or overt proteinuria, 66.7% took angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. Measurement of parameters indicating cardiovascular risk factors in type 2 diabetic patients was not optimal, particularly regular measurements for microalbuminuria and for controlling LDL-cholesterol and blood pressure.

Therefore, we investigated effects of EGCG treatment to simultaneously improve cardiovascular and metabolic function in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR; model of metabolic syndrome with hypertension, insulin resistance, and overweight). In acute studies, EGCG (1-100 microM) elicited dose-dependent vasodilation in mesenteric vascular beds (MVB) isolated from SHR ex vivo that was inhibitable by N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; nitric oxide synthase antagonist) or wortmannin [phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase inhibitor]. In chronic studies, 9-wk-old SHR were treated by gavage for 3 wk with EGCG (200 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)), enalapril (30 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)), or vehicle. A separate group of SHR receiving L-NAME (80 mg/l in drinking water) was treated for 3 wk with either EGCG or vehicle. Vasodilator actions of insulin were significantly improved in MVB from EGCG- or enalapril-treated SHR (when compared with vehicle-treated SHR). Both EGCG and enalapril therapy significantly lowered systolic blood pressure (SBP) in SHR. EGCG therapy of SHR significantly reduced infarct size and improved cardiac function in Langendorff-perfused hearts exposed to ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. In SHR given L-NAME, beneficial effects of EGCG on SBP and I/R were not observed. Both enalapril and EGCG treatment of SHR improved insulin sensitivity and raised plasma adiponectin levels. We conclude that acute actions of EGCG to stimulate production of nitric oxide from endothelium using PI 3-kinase-dependent pathways may explain, in part, beneficial effects of EGCG therapy to simultaneously improve metabolic and cardiovascular pathophysiology in SHR. These findings may be relevant to understanding potential benefits of green tea consumption in patients with the metabolic syndrome.",

CKD is often characterized by sympathetic hyperactivity. This study investigates the prevalence of sympathetic hyperactivity (quantified by assessment of muscle sympathetic nerve activity [MSNA]) in a sizable group of patients with CKD and assessed whether chronic angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker normalizes increased MSNA. In 74 CKD patients (creatinine clearance 54+/-31 mL/min), MSNA, blood pressure, and plasma renin activity were measured in the absence of antihypertensive drugs except for diuretics. In a subgroup of 31 patients, another set of measurements was obtained after > or =6 weeks of enalapril (10 mg PO), losartan (100 mg PO), or eprosartan (600 mg PO). Patients as compared with control subjects (n=82) had higher mean arterial pressure (113+/-13 versus 89+/-7 mm Hg), MSNA (31+/-13 versus 19+/-7 bursts per minute), and log plasma renin activity (2.67+/-036 versus 2.40+/-0.32 fmol/L per second; all P<0.001). During angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker therapy (n=31), mean arterial pressure (115+/-11 to 100+/-9 mm Hg) and MSNA (33+/-11 to 25+/-9 bursts per minute) decreased (both P<0.01) but were still higher than in control subjects (both P<0.01). Multiple regression analysis identified age and plasma renin activity as predictive for MSNA. In conclusion, sympathetic hyperactivity occurs in a substantial proportion of hypertensive CKD patients. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker treatment reduces but does not normalize MSNA.",

The relationship between insulin resistance and cardiovascular diseases was investigated in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Eighty-one maintenance HD patients were enrolled. The homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) method was used to assess insulin resistance. The relationship of HOMA-IR with cardiovascular and all-cause events was assessed. Compared with nondiabetic patients (n = 55), diabetic patients (n = 26) showed higher HOMA-IR (2.5 +/- 0.3 vs 1.4 +/- 0.2, P < .05), lower ankle-brachial pressure index (ABI, 0.85 +/- 0.09 vs 1.12 +/- 0.02, P < .01), and shorter HD duration (3 +/- 1 vs 9 +/- 1 years, P < .01), although their body mass index was similar (22.3 +/- 0.5 vs 21.5 +/- 0.4 kg/m(2)). Nondiabetic patients taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (n = 36) had lower HOMA-IR (1.2 +/- 0.2 vs 1.8 +/- 0.4, P < .05) and higher ABI (1.18 +/- 0.02 vs 1.02 +/- 0.05, P < .01) than those without (n = 17). Cardiovascular events were less common in HD patients with normal HOMA-IR (P < .05) or ABI (P < .01). Our data indicate that 69% of diabetic and 27% of nondiabetic patients have HOMA-IR greater than 1.6, implying reduced insulin sensitivity in HD patients. The present results provide evidence that angiotensin inhibition improves insulin resistance, possibly preventing vascular injury in HD patients. Finally, our findings suggest that insulin resistance is prognostic of cardiovascular events in HD patients.",

Hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and hypothyroidism should be treated, and smoking should be stopped. Statins reduce the incidence of intermittent claudication and increase exercise duration until the onset of intermittent claudication in persons with PAD and hypercholesterolemia. Antiplatelet drugs (eg, aspirin, clopidogrel, angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors, statins) should be given to all persons with PAD. Beta blockers should be given if CAD is present.

    "157": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and heart failure (CHF) are common conditions. The prevalence of COPD ranges from 20% to 30% in patients with CHF. The diagnosis of CHF can remain unsuspected in patients with COPD, because shortness of breath is attributed to COPD. Measurement of plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels helps to uncover unsuspected CHF in patients with COPD and clinical deterioration. Noninvasive assessment of cardiac function may be preferable to BNP to uncover unsuspected left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction in patients with stable COPD. Patients with COPD or CHF develop skeletal muscle alterations that are strikingly similar. Functional intolerance correlates with severity of skeletal muscle alterations but not with severity of pulmonary or cardiac impairment in COPD and CHF, respectively. Improvement of pulmonary or cardiac function does not translate into relief of functional intolerance in patients with COPD or CHF unless skeletal muscle alterations concomitantly regress. The mechanisms responsible for skeletal muscle alterations are incompletely understood in COPD and in CHF. Disuse and low-level systemic inflammation leading to protein synthesis/degradation imbalance are likely to contribute. The presence of COPD impacts on the treatment of CHF, as COPD is still viewed as a contraindication to beta-blockade. Therefore, COPD often deprives patients with CHF due to LV systolic dysfunction of the most beneficial pharmacologic intervention. A large body of data indicates that patients with COPD tolerate well selective beta-blockade that should not be denied to CHF patients with concomitant COPD.",

The gold standard for diagnosis this type of aneurysm is coronary angiography, which provides information about the size, sample, location and number of aneurysms. Despite growing prevalence in recent years, controversy still exists as to the pathogenetic mechanisms that underlie this entity. An increased incidence of CAE has been reported in several disorders. Examples include atherosclerotic vascular disease, heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, usage of substances including herbicide spray, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and nitrates, previous arterial balloon angioplasty, polyarteritis nodosa and Kawasaki syndrome. In addition, possible factors contributing to CAE are imbalance between matrix metalloproteinase and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase, angiotensin converting enzyme genotype, elevated homocysteine levels, cocaine user, smoking, vascular trauma, nitrate use and diabetes. Emerging investigations have pinpointed inflammation as a central process in all stages of atherosclerosis. This inflammatory process culminates in acute thrombotic complications and clinical events, which is involved in different clinical settings of atherosclerotic diseases. Recent data have also showed that CAE is associated with inflammatory response presented as elevated inflammatory cytokines and C-reactive protein. Accordingly, more complete understanding of the pro- and anti-inflammatory circuits that operate during CAE in particular may foster the development of novel therapeutic approaches.",

The anticoagulant function of immobilized rTFPI is thought to occur primarily by its inhibition of plasma clotting factor Xa (FXa); however the kinetics of this reaction at a surface are as yet unknown. To better understand the surface inhibition reaction under flow conditions, a theoretical model was developed delineating the roles of mass transport and reaction kinetics for an in vitro parallel plate device used in prior experimental studies [Hall et al., J. Biomech. Eng. 120:484-490, 1998]. As a first approximation, the kinetics of inhibition of FXa by rTFPI reported for static, homogeneous systems was considered. The unsteady convection-diffusion equation was solved for different wall-shear rates and inlet concentrations of FXa using the computational fluid dynamics software CFD-ACE (ESI Software Group). The results show that the heterogeneous inhibition reaction is diffusion controlled prior to saturation of the rTFPI. The experimental results compare favorably with the model at the lower shear rates (100-400 s(-1)). At higher shear rates (>400 s(-1)) the theoretical results follow the same trend as the experimental results but show a greater inhibition of FXa, implying an effect of flow or shear on the inhibition reaction.",

In addition, abdominal ultrasound examinations showed no evidence of cholelithiasis or bile duct dilations. Review of his medication history with the family revealed that he was being treated with hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril for hypertension. An exploratory laparotomy was performed and revealed no common bile duct stones. Unfortunately, the patient's hospital course was complicated with multiple organ failure, which resulted in death.

    "162": "Angiotensin-(1-7) (Ang-(1-7)), a bioactive peptide in the renin-angiotensin system, has counterregulatory actions to angiotensin II (Ang II). However, the mechanism by which Ang-(1-7) enhances vasodepressor responses to bradykinin (BK) is not well understood. In the present study, the effects of Ang-(1-7) on responses to BK, BK analogs, angiotensin I (Ang I), and Ang II were investigated in the anesthetized rat. The infusion of Ang-(1-7) (55 pmol/min i.v.) enhanced decreases in systemic arterial pressure in response to i.v. injections of BK and the BK analogs [Hyp3, Tyr(Me)8]-bradykinin (HT-BK) and [Phe8psi (CH2-NH) Arg9]-bradykinin (PA-BK) without altering pressor responses to Ang I or II, or depressor responses to acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside. The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalaprilat enhanced responses to BK and the BK analog HT-BK without altering responses to PA-BK and inhibited responses to Ang I. The potentiating effects of Ang-(1-7) and enalaprilat on responses to BK were not attenuated by the Ang-(1-7) receptor antagonist A-779. Ang-(1-7)- and ACE inhibitor-potentiated responses to BK were attenuated by the BK B2 receptor antagonist Hoe 140. The cyclooxygenase inhibitor sodium meclofenamate had no significant effect on responses to BK or Ang-(1-7)-potentiated BK responses. These results suggest that Ang-(1-7) potentiates responses to BK by a selective B2 receptor mechanism that is independent of an effect on Ang-(1-7) receptors, ACE, or cyclooxygenase product formation. These data suggest that ACE inhibitor-potentiated responses to BK are not mediated by an A-779-sensitive mechanism and are consistent with the hypothesis that enalaprilat-induced BK potentiation is due to decreased BK inactivation.",

The individual gains seen with each of these drug classes have led to speculation that their combination might offer additive if not synergistic outcome benefits. The foundation of this hypothesis, although biologically possible, has thus far not been sufficiently well proven to support the everyday use of these 2 drug classes in combination.

    "169": "Treatment of resistant hypertension requires confirmation of true resistance, diagnosis and treatment of secondary causes of hypertension, adoption of appropriate lifestyle modifications, and effective use of multidrug antihypertensive regimens. Excessive volume retention often underlies resistant hypertension, so diuretics are generally necessary to achieve blood pressure (BP) goals. Although treatment regimens consisting of 3 or more agents have not been systematically evaluated, the author has found a triple regimen consisting of a thiazide diuretic, a calcium channel blocker, and an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) to be generally effective and well tolerated. Although hydrochlorothiazide is more widely used, chlorthalidone provides better BP reduction and should be preferentially used in patients with resistant hypertension, particularly if the patient remains uncontrolled on hydrochlorothiazide. Recent studies have demonstrated that low doses of aldosterone antagonists, when added to multidrug regimens that include a thiazide diuretic and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker, provide significant additional BP reduction, seemingly exceeding what would be expected with addition of alternative classes of agents. The degree of BP reduction induced by aldosterone blockade has been similar in patients with and without evidence of aldosterone excess. Aldosterone antagonists are generally safe and well tolerated. The most common adverse effect of low-dose spironolactone has been breast tenderness, occurring in about 10% of men. Hyperkalemia is uncommon, but can occur, necessitating biochemical monitoring. Risk of hyperkalemia is increased in patients with chronic kidney disease or diabetes, elderly patients, and patients already receiving an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker.",

The authors describe the in-hospital and discharge prescription patterns of lipid-lowering agents in patients hospitalized with an AMI, and identify factors associated with low rates of utilization of these therapies. The authors analyzed the Minnesota Heart Survey, a population-based surveillance project that retrospectively abstracted the medical records of patients hospitalized with AMI in 2001-2002 from 21 hospitals in the Minneapolis-St Paul metropolitan area. They identified 2773 patients 30 years and older with an AMI. The mean total cholesterol was 175+/-45 mg/dL, the mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was 104+/-38 mg/dL, and the mean high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was 44+/-14 mg/dL. Statins were prescribed at discharge to 74.6%, 63.2%, and 38.5% of patients younger than 65, 65-74, and 75 years and older, respectively (P<.0001). The utilization of statins was highly correlated with the administration of other standard AMI therapies-aspirin, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, and reperfusion therapy-and was more prevalent among patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention than among those undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery. Elderly patients remain less likely to receive lipid-lowering therapy following an AMI.

This study aimed to identify factors that are associated with changes in UAE in the nondiabetic population using data of the Prevention of Renal and Vascular End stage Disease (PREVEND) Study, a community-based prospective cohort study. Data of the 6647 nondiabetic participants who completed the first (1997 through 2001) and second (2001 through 2003) screening were used. Change in UAE was categorized as regression (n = 650), stable (n = 5240), or progression (n = 757) on the basis of change in class during follow-up, with classes being a UAE <15, 15 to 30, 30 to 300, and >300 mg/24 h. With the use of stepwise forward multinomial regression analysis changes in BP, fasting glucose concentration, and start of antihypertensive drugs were found to be the most important modifiable variables associated with the risk for progression and regression (P < 0.01 for likelihood ratio test). The odds ratios to develop regression or progression of UAE during follow-up were 0.64 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.57 to 0.73) and 1.91 (95% CI 1.72 to 2.12), respectively, per 10-mmHg increase in BP during follow-up, 0.89 (95% CI 0.80 to 0.98) and 1.09 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.17), respectively, per 1-mmol/L increase of fasting glucose levels during follow-up, and 1.57 (95% CI 1.21 to 2.06) and 0.70 (95% CI 0.51 to 0.95), respectively, for start of antihypertensive drugs during follow-up. These associations were independent of baseline BP, glucose, body mass index, estimated GFR, and UAE and changes in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein during follow-up. In conclusion, changes in glucose concentration and BP and start of antihypertensive drugs (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers in >50% of cases) are associated with progression and regression of UAE in the nondiabetic population. Although associations do not necessarily suggest causality, it is hypothesized that in the general population, the most important ways to reduce UAE are by lowering glucose concentration and BP (including start of antihypertensive medication), even in normotensive, nondiabetic individuals.",

    "174": "The metabolic syndrome or cardiovascular dysmetabolic syndrome is characterized by obesity, central obesity, insulin resistance, atherogenic dyslipidemia, and hypertension. The major risk factors leading to this syndrome are physical inactivity and an atherogenic diet and cornerstone clinical feature is abdominal obesity or adiposity. In addition, patients usually have elevated triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol, elevated LDL cholesterol, other abnormal lipid parameters, hypertension, and elevated fasting blood glucose. Impaired fibrinolysis, increased susceptibility to thrombotic events, and raised inflammatory markers are also observed. Given that India has the largest number of subjects with type-2 diabetes in the world it can be extrapolated that this country also has the largest number of patients with the metabolic syndrome. Epidemiological studies confirm a high prevalence. Therapeutic approach involves intervention at a macro-level and control of multiple risk factors using therapeutic lifestyle approaches (diet control and increased physical activity, pharmacotherapy - anti-obesity agents) for control of obesity and visceral obesity, and targeted approach for control of individual risk factors. Pharmacological therapy is a critical step in the management of patients with metabolic syndrome when lifestyle modifications fail to achieve the therapeutic goals. Anti-obesity drugs such as sibutramine and orlistat can be tried to reduce weight and central obesity and jointly control the metabolic syndrome components. Other than weight loss, there is no single best therapy and treatment should consist of treatment of individual components of the metabolic syndrome. Newer drugs such as the endocannabinoid receptor blocker,rimonabant, appear promising in this regard. Atherogenic dyslipidemia should be controlled initially with statins if there is an increase in LDL cholesterol. If there are other lipid abnormalities then combination therapy of statin with fibrates, nicotinic acid, or ezetimibe should be considered. For insulin resistance, drugs such as thiazolidinediones and renin-angiotensin system blockers are available. Available evidence suggests that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBS) may be more beneficial for treatment of hypertension in patients with metabolic syndrome compared to others as these drugs also prevent development of diabetes. Patients with metabolic syndrome also have elevations in fibrinogen and other coagulation factors leading to prothrombotic state and aspirin may be beneficial for primary prevention in these patients. The new developments in the treatment of metabolic syndrome with drugs, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonists and cannabinoid receptor-1 antagonists, will broaden the horizons of the current treatment options. Fixed-dose combination polypharmacy using a single pill is an interesting concept that needs to be evaluated in long-term prospective trials in such patients.",

Combining ACEi and aldosterone receptor blockade (aldoRB) in proteinuric renal disease reduces proteinuria, but effects on proteinuria-induced renal damage are unknown. We studied the effect of ACEi/aldoRB in adriamycin nephrosis (AN). Six weeks after injection of adriamycin in Wistar rats, randomized treatment with vehicle (VEH, n=8), aldoRB (n=12), ACEi (n=10), or a combination of ACEi/aldoRB (n=14) was given for 12 weeks. Healthy rats served as controls (n=6). Renal damage was quantified by markers of tubular injury (osteopontin (OPN) and kidney injury molecule-1 (Kim-1)), pre-fibrotic lesions (alpha-smooth muscle actin (SMA)), interstitial fibrosis (IF), and focal glomerulosclerosis (FGS). In AN animals, proteinuria was increased compared with controls. ACEi and ACEi/aldoRB significantly reduced proteinuria compared with VEH, whereas aldoRB monotherapy was without effect. Blood pressure was reduced in ACEi and ACEi/aldoRB compared with VEH and aldoRB. OPN and Kim-1 were increased in AN animals, but significantly reduced by ACEi/aldoRB. Treatment with ACEi and ACEi/aldoRB prevented an increase of SMA, IF, and FGS. In conclusion, ACEi/aldoRB effectively reduced proteinuria and markers of tubular injury and prevented renal damage in this rat model of chronic proteinuria-induced renal damage.",

During the past few years, a number of large randomized clinical trials examined the frequency of new onset diabetes mellitus during administration of antihypertensive drugs. Application of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers reduces the risk for the onset of diabetes mellitus by 20-27%, and calcium channel blockers by 16%. Despite some uncertainties, novel studies have demonstrated an increased risk for cardiovascular complications related to new onset diabetes mellitus. The duration of patient monitoring is also an important factor, as the onset of diabetes-related complications is closely associated with the duration of this disease. Considering all above, the aim of preventing the onset of diabetes is to recognize patients with an increased risk. The risk factors include basal glycemia, positive family history for diabetes mellitus, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and some ethnic groups (South Asia, the Caribbeans). Therefore, increased-risk patients should be subjected to therapy with ACE inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, or calcium channel blocker as the first drug of choice. For these patients, application of thiazides and beta blockers or the combination of these two drugs is not advantageous. However, such a view poses a dilemma whether thiazide diuretics should be the first choice in the treatment of hypertension.",

Recent trials have consistently shown that therapy involving beta-blockers and diuretics may have some negative impact on metabolic and haemodynamic disorders present in metabolic syndrome.

There was no statistical evidence of an interaction between the ramipril and the rosiglitazone arms. After a mean follow up of 3 years, the use of ramipril does not significantly reduce the incidence of diabetes or death but does significantly increase regression to normoglycaemia. In contrast, the treatment with rosiglitazone reduces by almost 60% the incidence of type 2 diabetes and increases the likelihood (+70%) of regression to normoglycaemia. Whether it is a true prevention effect or simply a treatment effect remains to be determined when participants will be retested after a washout period. Cardiovascular event rates were rather low and much the same in all treatment groups, except a higher rate of heart failure in the rosiglitazone group. These results suggest that the routine inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system for the express purpose of preventing diabetes is not indicated in individuals not at high risk for cardiovascular disease and appear to confirm the promises of the glitazone use in the very early stage of the natural history of type 2 diabetes.", 
    "198": "The role of renin-angiotensin system and baroreceptors in the pathogenesis and prevention of hypertension due to salt-loading and concurrent dietary calcium for 6 weeks in Sprague-Dawley rats were studied. Blood pressure measurements were done in anaesthetized animals while the activities of renin-angiotensin and parasympathetic nervous systems were determined by the effect of their inhibition on the arterial pressure and baroreflex sensitivity, via captopril infusion and vagotomy respectively. The sympathetic nervous system activity and its effect on baroreflex response were estimated by combined captopril infusion and vagotomy. There was elevation of mean arterial pressure (MAP) in salt-loaded rats (SR) relative to controls (NR) (140.5 +/- 2.18 vs 98.0 +/- 1.38 mmHg) without any significant effect on heart rate (HR) (406 +/- 8.58 vs 428 +/- 11.20 beats/min). Calcium supplement abolished the rise in MAP of salt-loaded-calcium-fed rats (SCaR) (102.8 +/- 2.30 mmHg) but led to reduction in their HR (389 +/- 10.21 beats/ min) relative to control. Renin-angiotensin system inhibition led to fall in MAP in all groups of rats with the greatest reduction observed in SR. Inhibition of parasympathetic effects resulted in elevation of MAP in all thegroups. with SCaR and CaR having the highest rise. SR and SCaR had higher sympathetic activity than NR and CaR. Bilateral carotid occlusion test showed decrease baroreflex sensitivity in SR compared with NR while those of SCaR were enhanced without significantly affecting CaR. Also, there was enhanced baroreflex response (BRR) due to renin-angiotensin system inhibition in NR and SR while it was significantly reduced in SCaR but none in CaR. However, there was reduced BRR to parasympathetic inhibition in experimental groups except in CaR. Unmodified sympathetic activity resulted in enhanced BRR in all the groups. The results of the present study suggests that renin-angiotensin and autonomic nervous systems are impaired by dietary salt-loading, while prevention of salt-hypertension by calcium supplement is through modulation of these actions.", 
    "199": "Alveolar hypoxia (AH) induces widespread systemic inflammation. Previous studies have shown dissociation between microvascular Po(2) and inflammation. Furthermore, plasma from AH rats (PAHR) induces mast cell (MC) activation, inflammation, and vasoconstriction in normoxic cremasters, while plasma from normoxic rats does not produce these responses. These results suggest that inflammation of AH is triggered by a blood-carried agent. This study investigated the involvement of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the inflammation of AH. Both an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and an angiotensin II (ANG II) receptor blocker (ANG II RB) inhibited the leukocyte-endothelial adherence produced by AH, as well as the inflammation produced by PAHR in normoxic rat cremasters. MC stabilization with cromolyn blocked the effects of PAHR but not those of topical ANG II on normoxic cremasters, suggesting ANG II generation via MC activation by PAHR. This was supported by the observation that ACE inhibition and ANG II RB blocked the leukocyte-endothelial adherence produced by the MC secretagogue compound 48/80. These results suggest that the intermediary agent contained in PAHR activates MC and stimulates the RAS, leading to inflammation, and imply an RAS role in AH-induced inflammation.",

The authors evaluated the effects of low-dose spironolactone alone or in combination with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on the progression of left ventricular dysfunction and remodeling in a congenic rat model of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The congenic SS-16/Mcwi rats developed severe cardiac hypertrophy despite being normotensive even on high-salt diet. SS-16/Mcwi and SS/Mcwi rats were fed a low-salt (0.4% NaCl) diet and were treated with vehicle (CON), spironolactone (20 mg/kg/d subcutaneously), captopril (100 mg/kg/d drinking water), or both spironolactone and captopril for 4 weeks. Blood pressure, plasma peptides, cardiac fibrosis, and echocardiography measurements were evaluated. Spironolactone at a low dose had no effect on blood pressure, cardiac hypertrophy, and fibrosis in either strain. However, in combination with captopril, spironolactone decreased the cardiac hypertrophy more than captopril treatment alone. In the SS-16/Mcwi rats, the combined therapy significantly preserved the cardiac index when compared with control. These data indicate that the addition of low-dose spironolactone to captopril treatment was more effective in preventing the progression of heart hypertrophy and ventricular dysfunction in the SS-16/Mcwi than captopril alone.

Therefore the assessment of the vascular damage or the follow-up of therapy need a complex and simultaneous approach. Currently the morphological and functional changes in the vascular system can be investigated with separated measuring systems, focusing either to cardiac or cerebral parameters (intermittent blood pressure measurement, ECG, cerebral blood flow by transcranial Doppler e.g.). Our purpose is to establish a complex non-invasive system for the simultaneous measurement and comparison of cardiac/cerebral/peripheral hemodynamics. The hemodynamic parameters in hypertensive patients are examined with transcranial Doppler and cardiac monitoring during tilt-table test. Intima-media thickness, flow-mediated dilatation in brachial artery, augmentation index and pulse wave velocity are also measured. The measurement will be repeated after 6 and 12 months follow-up. Our preliminary results are similar to those found in the literature, that proves the reliability of our complex noninvasive hemodynamic system. It is assumed, that 12 months antihypertensive therapies with ACE inhibitors, calcium antagonist etc. might result in different effects on different vascular parameters. Our system enables the individualization of antihypertensive therapy.", 
    "223": "Therapies aimed at destruction of the tumor vasculature are now recognized as a promising approach against cancer, and it has been reported that the combination treatment with an angiogenic inhibitor and conventional chemotherapeutic drug exerted synergistic anti-cancerous effects. We previously reported that the clinically used angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) exerted potent-anti-angiogenic activities. The aim of our current study was to examine the combined effect of ACE-I and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), which is widely used for hepatogastrointestinal tumors, on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) growth and hepatocarcinogenesis. When used individually at low doses, neither 5-FU nor ACE-I exerted significant inhibitory effects on the HCC growth. However, the combination treatment of 5-FU and ACE-I showed a potent inhibitory effect on HCC growth along with suppression of neovascularization in the tumor. The expression level of the vascular endothelial growth factor, a potent angiogenic factor, was also suppressed, almost in conjunction with tumor growth inhibition. Furthermore, 5-FU and ACE-I treatment resulted in a marked increase of apoptosis in the tumor. In the hepatocarcinogenesis model, the combination treatment with 5-FU and ACE-I also showed a marked inhibitory effect on the development of preneoplastic lesions. The in vitro study demonstrated that this combination treatment inhibited endothelial cell tubular formation. Collectively, the combination treatment of 5-FU and ACE-I exerted a marked synergistic inhibitory effect on HCC growth via suppression of angiogenesis. This regimen also showed a chemopreventive effect against hepatocarcinogenesis. Since both 5-FU and ACE-I are widely used in clinical practice, this combination therapy may be an effective new therapeutic strategy against HCC in the future.",

Myocardial infarction was induced in rats by ligation of the left coronary artery. The coronary artery-ligated (CAL) and sham-operated (Sham) rats were orally treated with 3 mg/kg/d trandolapril from the 2nd to 8th week after surgery. Hemodynamic parameters and tissue weights of the left and right ventricles of the animals at the 8th week after CAL (8w-CAL rats) showed signs indicating chronic heart failure. An increase in Hsp60 content, a decrease in mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR), and an increase in the mitochondrial thiobarbiturate-reacting substance (TRS) of the viable LV were detected. Eight weeks after CAL. Long-term treatment of the CAL rats with trandolapril improved the hemodynamic parameters, attenuated the CAL-induced increase in Hsp60 content, the decrease in mitochondrial OCR, and the increase in the mitochondrial TRS content of the viable LV at the 8th week after myocardial infarction. The increase in Hsp60 content was closely related to the decrease in the mitochondrial OCR and to a rise in the LVEDP of the CAL animal at the 8th week after myocardial infarction. These results suggest that a series of pathophysiological alterations, including a reduction in mitochondrial function, appearance of reactive oxygen stress, and production of Hsp60 is involved in the development of cardiac failure and that trandolapril is beneficial for preventing these alterations.",

ACE inhibitors have been particularly well studied in acute and chronic MI with consistent and substantial survival benefits demonstrated, particularly in the higher risk groups. The recent development of angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor blockers (ARBs) as a well tolerated pharmacological therapy to more completely inhibit the actions of Ang II at the AT1-receptor level raises questions concerning comparative efficacy with the proven ACE inhibitor experience. Two major trials will provide a direct comparison of ARBs with an ACE inhibitor. The Valsartan in Acute Myocardial Infarction (VALIANT) trial is specifically designed to compare and contrast the ARB, valsartan, used both alone as well as in combination with a proven ACE inhibitor regimen, in a high risk MI population. VALIANT, with its three arms targetting 14,500 patients, is uniquely poised to determine whether the pharmacological advance in the development of ARBs confers additional clinical (survival) value in high risk MI patients.",

Clinical trials often do not reflect community practice where patients are older and have more co-morbid conditions. Therapeutic agents need to be at least neutral in their effects on these other conditions. Current therapy in heart failure includes angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta-blockers and diuretics, with advanced heart failure patients receiving spironolactone and possibly digitalis. Ongoing clinical trials are testing more effective inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) with highly selective angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor blockers (ARBs) such as valsartan. Future trials should study diverse racial groups and the elderly, particularly those with preserved systolic function.

To improve GFR, the high blood pressure (BP) and proteinuria often seen in these patients must both be controlled. These symptoms lead not only to progressive loss of renal function, but also to an increase in cardiovascular risk. Use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in these patients has been reported to control BP and reduce protein excretion and cardiovascular risk. Complete blockade of angiotensin II (Ang II) action with the highly selective Ang II receptor blocker (ARB) valsartan, both as monotherapy and in combination with ACE inhibitors, is well-tolerated and efficacious in patients with renal failure. Unlike ACE inhibition, ARB treatment leads to no initial reduction in GFR, thus valsartan may be a better agent for the control of BP, with greater renal protection.",

The ABCD trial was a five-year study that compared the effects of intensive vs. moderate BP control on the endpoints of nephropathy, retinopathy, neuropathy, and cardiovascular disease events using a calcium channel blocker (CCB) and an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor as the primary antihypertensive agents. The recently published results of the hypertensive cohort of ABCD are reviewed herein. The follow-up study, ABCD-2V, is ongoing and was designed to compare intensive vs. moderate BP control on the same endpoints as the ABCD study, using the highly selective angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) valsartan as the primary antihypertensive agent. First results of ABCD-2V are expected in 2004. The baseline characteristics for the patients enrolled thus far in the hypertensive cohort of ABCD-2V are reviewed.

This rationale is under evaluation in a number of long-term morbidity and mortality trials which will report over the next few years, with the largest, VALUE, due to provide results in 2004.

The authors have summarized findings from key clinical trials published recent years that contribute to clinicians' understanding of how best to optimize therapy. The goals for the management of NSTE-ACS are rapid and accurate risk stratification, appropriate and institution-specific triage to interventional versus medical strategies and optimal pharmacologic therapy--all of which provide for a smooth and seamless transition of care between the emergency department and the cardiology service. High-risk features or absolute treatment trigger criteria that support more aggressive medical therapy (i.e., addition of small-molecule GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor to a core regimen of aspirin, enoxaparin, and in most cases, clopidogrel) and/or that would direct clinicians toward percutaneous, mechanical/interventional strategies as the preferred modality include, but are not limited to, the presence of one or more of the following: (1) elevated cardiac markers (troponin and/or CK-MB); (2) elevated levels of inflammatory markers (particularly CRP > 3 microg/dl); (3) age > 65 years; (4) presence of ST-T wave changes; (5) TIMI Risk Score greater than or equal to 4; (6) diabetes; and/or (7) clinical instability in the setting of suspected NSTE-ACS. Specific clinical, ECG and/or biochemical trigger points modulate the aggressiveness of both the medical therapy and the propensity to perform early angiography with or without subsequent revascularization in patients with NSTE-ACS. Although additional refinements and changes in ACS management are still to come, evidence-based strategies suggest that prompt mechanical revascularization is associated with the best possible clinical outcomes, particularly for patients with high-risk features and in whom benefits of adjunctive, pharmacoinvasive antithrombotic therapies can be consolidated. Patient transfer for cardiac catheterization/percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is strongly recommended in patients who manifest high-risk features and/or aggressive treatment trigger criteria, so that this high-risk subgroup may receive definitive, interventional and/or cardiology-directed specialty care at appropriate sites of care. When available, interventional management is preferred in these patients. The importance of safe and effective anticoagulation in the spectrum of management strategies has been confirmed, and the evidence in support of enoxaparin and other antithrombotic agents has been reviewed. Dosing recommendations for enoxaparin use in the setting of PCI have been issued by the CATH Panel and have been summarized in this consensus report. Similar recommendations have been presented for the use of oral antiplatelet agents and GP IIb/IIIa antagonists. The addition of statins, ACE-inhibitors and beta-blockers is also stressed as part of a comprehensive secondary cardioprotective strategy for patients with coronary heart disease.", 
    "259": "We investigated the involvement of angiotensin II and vascular smooth muscle sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) function in the impaired NO-induced relaxation seen in established streptozotocin-induced diabetes. Plasma angiotensin II levels, which were elevated in untreated diabetic rats (vs age-matched controls), were improved by treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril. Systolic blood pressure was significantly decreased in chronic enalapril-treated diabetics (vs the other two groups). Intact aortae from diabetic rats and chronic angiotensin II-infused control rats, but not those from diabetic rats treated with enalapril, showed impaired endothelium-dependent relaxations to acetylcholine (vs controls). The relaxation induced by Angeli's Salt (a NO donor) was significantly impaired in endothelium-denuded aortae from diabetic rats (vs controls) but it was normalised by enalapril treatment. After preincubation with the irreversible SERCA inhibitor, thapsigargin, the relaxation induced by Angeli's Salt was significantly impaired in endothelium-denuded aortae from the controls, but not from the diabetics, and there was no significant difference between the thapsigargin-treated groups. Nitrotyrosine, an indirect marker of peroxynitrite, was markedly increased in aortic smooth muscle from diabetic rats, while chronic enalapril administration reduced this increase. These results suggest that in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, excessive angiotensin II production may lead to the generation of peroxynitrite and that this may in turn trigger a dysfunction of vascular smooth muscle SERCA. Enalapril improved the diabetes-related impairments.",

    "261": "Angiotensin plays a major role in renal deterioration, and inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system slows the progression of renal lesions after nephron reduction both in animal models and in humans with chronic kidney diseases. The EGF receptor (EGFR) has recently been recognized as a key molecule in the progression of chronic renal failure, but the interaction between angiotensin and EGF is poorly understood. We show that transgenic mice harboring a dominant negative form of EGFR are resistant to the progression of renal lesions induced by nephron reduction or angiotensin infusion. TGF-alpha, an EGFR ligand, and its sheddase TACE, are overexpressed after angiotensin infusion, and angiotensin-induced renal lesions are blunted in TGF-alpha knockout mice and by pharmacological TACE blockade. After nephron reduction, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists prevent TGF-alpha and TACE accumulation. These results indicate that EGFR transactivation by angiotensin plays a crucial role in renal deterioration and that pharmacological inhibitors of TACE might be useful for preventing the progression of chronic kidney diseases.",

There is also some evidence that these effects are greater than those achieved by blood pressure reduction alone, suggesting other drug-related effects including improvements in endothelial function. Recent results have also shown that an amlodipine \u00b1 perindopril regimen prevented more major cardiovascular events than an atenolol-based regimen in patients with hypertension, as a result of better control of blood pressure. Economic evidence from one major study shows that, for most patients, the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained with perindopril 8 mg was lower than the threshold value of \u20ac20 000 (73-92% of patients) in Europe or \u00a320 000 (94% of patients) in the UK.",

However, the use of CCBs as monotherapy has recently been overshadowed by the introduction of newer classes of agents such as angiotensin receptor blockers. Examining the pharmacologic and clinical effects of CCBs in essential hypertension and among specific patient groups (e.g. African Americans, patients with renal disease) paves the way for understanding why these agents are currently enjoying a resurgence in popularity as the basis for several fixed-dose combination regimens that promise to improve BP control and reduce the risk of cardiovascular events.", 
    "272": "The papers in this supplement speak to several of the issues pertinent to contemporary therapy with CCBs. The article by Dr Weir thoughtfully describes important pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic features of CCBs. In so doing he establishes the basis for combination CCB and ACE inhibitor therapy. Dr Frishman provides a scholarly description of the cardiovascular effects of CCBs and further elaborates on the distinctiveness of the various CCB subclasses. Finally, Dr Bakris et al. provides data from INVEST (INternational VErapamil-Trandolapril STudy), which shows the particular utility of a CCB and ACE inhibitor combination in bringing elderly hypertensive patients with CAD to goal BP when monotherapy", 
    "273": "The majority of hypertensive patients require combination therapy to achieve BP goals. Guidelines recommend dual therapy in newly diagnosed patients with BP > 160/100mm Hg. Calcium channel blocker (CCB)/ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker (beta-adrenoceptor antagonists)/diuretic combinations are among regimens considered effective for BP control. ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, and CCBs are recommended for use in patients after myocardial infarction (MI). Statistical modeling from INVEST (INternational VErapamil-Trandolapril STudy), suggests an association between dual and triple therapy and decreased risk of primary outcome ([PO] first occurrence of death, nonfatal MI, or nonfatal stroke) in patients with hypertension and coronary artery disease (CAD).", 
    "274": "This study explores the utility of dual antihypertensive therapy by reporting BP and cardiovascular outcomes for INVEST patients who predominantly received either a CCB/ACE inhibitor or a beta-blocker/ diuretic regimen.", 
    "275": "1170 patients were selected for analysis. After 24 months of treatment, BP control (Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure VI criteria) was 82.1% and 82.6% in the verapamil sustained release (SR) + trandolapril (Ve + Tr) and atenolol + hydrochlorothiazide (At + HCTZ) groups, respectively (p = 0.86). In Ve + Tr compared to At + HCTZ patients, adjusted risk for PO (hazard ratio [HR] 0.63; 95% CI 0.37, 1.05; p = 0.07) and unadjusted risks for secondary outcomes including death (HR 0.70; 95% CI 0.40, 1.25), total MI (HR 0.82; 95% CI 0.35, 1.90), total stroke (HR 0.81; 95% CI 0.25, 2.65) and new diabetes (HR 0.88; 95% CI 0.55, 1.41) were not statistically different.", 
    "276": "This analysis shows that combination treatment with either Ve+ Tr or At +- HCTZ is effective in achieving BP control and produces similar outcomes in hypertensive patients with CAD.", 
    "277": "Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) share a common mechanism of action. However, the manner in which they exert their pharmacological effects is different between subclasses. Dihydropyridine (DHP) CCBs tend to be more potent vasodilators than non-dihydropyridine (non-DHP) agents, whereas the latter have more marked negative inotropic effects. Both subclasses have a similar capacity to lower BP; however, non-DHPs appear to offer potential advantages in the management of patients with chronic kidney disease and diabetic nephropathy. Representatives of both classes are now available in fixed-dose combinations containing an ACE inhibitor, the benefits of which include effective 24-hour BP control, a reduced incidence of adverse effects, and improved adherence.", 
    "278": "The combination of a beta-blocker, a platelet inhibitor, a statin and an ACE inhibitor (B.A.S.I.C. regimen) provides major therapeutic benefits in the management of coronary patients. In patients receiving the quadruple combination, the overall mortality risk is 75% lower than for patients receiving none of these four therapies. According to the data from the PREVENIR III study, the combination of a statin and a platelet inhibitor reduces the risk of recurrent coronary events by 71%, the risk of recurrent vascular events by 65% and the risk of death from all causes taken together by 68%, when compared with the absence of these two medications. In the French USIC 2000 survey, prescription of the triple combination of platelet inhibitor, statin and beta-blocker is also associated with a 50% reduction in overall mortality. However, although the B.A.S.I.C. strategy is of major therapeutic value, it markedly increases the number of tablets to be taken every day. Treatment compliance, which is a predictive factor for overall mortality in diabetic coronary patients, diminishes markedly as the number of medications to be taken every day increases. The availability of fixed combinations, e.g. statin-acetylsalicylic acid, thus makes it possible to reduce the number of tablets to be taken at any one time, thus potentially increasing treatment compliance and the efficacy of the treatment administered.", 
    "279": "The management of coronary patients aims at improving the prognosis, by preventing myocardial infarction and/or death, and also at optimal reduction of symptoms related to coronary disease. This can be achieved by a variety of approaches including coronary revascularisation, life-style modifications and drug therapies including several drug classes: platelet inhibitors, beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, statins and anti-anginal drugs. The B.A.S.I.C. regimen is a combination of a beta-blocker, a platelet inhibitor, a statin and an ACE inhibitor for secondary prevention in coronary patients. Although recommended in the latest ESC and AHA/ACC guidelines, this strategy is insufficiently applied in medical practice. Indeed, the results of the European Action on Secondary Prevention by Intervention to Reduce Events (EUROASPIRE) Survey conducted over the period 1999-2000, show that 6 months after a first hospitalisation for aorto-coronary bypass, percutaneous coronary angioplasty, myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome, 86% of patients are prescribed a platelet inhibitor, 63% a beta-blocker, 61% a hypolipidaemic agent and only 38%, an ACE inhibitor. The PREVENIR Study published in 2005 reported that only 12% of patients are prescribed the B.A.S.I.C. quadritherapy outside the acute phase. Despite recognised benefits in terms of survival, the B.A.S.I.C. approach is therefore clearly under-prescribed following coronary events.", 
    "280": "Advances in the field of kidney transplantation have led to a significant increase in the life of renal allograft with 1-year graft survival rates of 93% to 99%. This increase in early graft survival has made it possible to observe the long-term morbidities that accompany renal transplantation. Studies correlating the reduction of arterial blood pressure with patient and graft survival as well as the risk of cardiovascular disease do not exist. The recommendations come from the general population and from comparative studies of hypertensive and normotensive kidney graft recipients. It is known that in the general population hypertension is a risk factor for chronic kidney disease but at the same time a risk factor for death, ischaemic heart disease, chronic heart failure and left ventricular hypertrophy. We must always have in mind that there are many similarities between a kidney graft recipient and a patient with chronic kidney disease. Renal transplant recipients represent a patient population with a very high risk for development of cardiovascular disease which has been identified as the leading cause of death in these patients. Of 18,482 deaths among renal allograft recipients, 38% had functioning renal allografts. Successful renal transplantation (Rt) can result in partial regression of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) if it is associated with hypertension (HTN) remission or if HTN is controlled by medications. Frequently post transplant HTN is associated with failure of LVH to regress. Transplant clinicians must choose antihypertensive agents that will provide their patients with maximum benefit from renal allograft and cardiovascular perspective. The target must always be long term patient and graft survival and acceptable quality of life. The antihypertensive drugs usually used after kidney transplantation are diuretics, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers and beta-blockers. Most emphasis is given lately to ACEIs/ARBs and beta-blockers because of their cardioprotecive effect.",

    "289": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory drugs have been used as therapeutic tools in the clinical management of hypertension and associated cardiovascular disorders. Food-derived ACE-inhibitory peptides have lower potency than similar acting drugs but the peptides usually have no adverse side effects and there is virtually no risk of overdosing that is associated with drugs. This review summarizes several patents that have reported the development of technologies for the production of potent food protein-derived hydrolysates and peptides, which can be used to formulate antihypertensive functional foods and nutraceuticals. A common process to all the patents is the use of proteases to split large inactive proteins into smaller bioactive peptides. Ultrafiltration may be combined with liquid chromatography methods to separate the peptides according to size alone or a combination of size and charge density, respectively. Efficacy of the protein hydrolysates or peptide fractions is evaluated first in an in vitro system and may then be confirmed by measuring their hypotensive ability in an appropriate animal model such as the spontaneously hypertensive rats. Finally, protein hydrolysates or peptide fractions that have hypotensive ability may then be used to formulate foods, beverages or pills that can be taken as therapeutic tools against hypertension.",

Subsequently, the velocity during a defined observation period was compared between patients with one risk factor and patients with two or more risk factors. Finally, the dose effects of drugs identified as risk factors for a high velocity of the development of hyperkalaemia were analysed using two sample comparisons.", 
    "303": "A random sample of 551 hospitalised patients was analysed. Compared with the drug treatment at entry, significantly more patients during the hospitalisation were treated with drugs associated with hyperkalaemia, such as heparins (p<0.001), ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) [p=0.002], potassium supplements (p<0.001), potassium-sparing diuretics (p<0.001) and/or NSAIDs or selective cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors (p<0.001). Risk factors associated with a high velocity of the development of hyperkalaemia were use of potassium supplements (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 3.386; 95% CI 2.251, 5.091), severe renal impairment (OR 3.119; 95% CI 2.007, 4.850), use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs (OR 2.642; 95% CI 1.742, 4.006), use of potassium-sparing diuretics (OR 2.065; 95% CI 1.310, 3.254), and diabetes mellitus (OR 1.525; 95% CI 1.005, 2.313).

The coronary artery disease in diabetes has specificities and, in particular, more extensive atherosclerosis. Diabetic patients are also more frequently asymptomatic. Due to the extreme complexity of ischemic vascular disease in patients with diabetes, an optimal therapeutic strategy is based on the correction of elevated blood glucose and lipid levels, of blood pressure, of platelet and coagulation abnormalities. Diabetic patients benefit from secondary prevention by drug therapy(aspirin, lipid lowering with statines, beta blocker and ACE inhibitors) to the same extent as, or more than, non-diabetic patients. Both percutaneous and surgical myocardial revascularization have been proved equally effective for CAD treatment in diabetes. A recent randomized trial has shown a significantly improved outcome after surgical revascularization. But, the effects of drug-eluting stents, which dramatically decrease the incidence of re-stenosis, seem promising.",

In its second part, an evaluation of METEOR, a rule-based expert system used to predict the metabolism of drugs and other xenobiotics, is reported. The published metabolic data of ten substrates were used in this evaluation, the overall results being discussed in terms of correct vs. disputable (i.e., false-positive and false-negative) predictions.

    "307": "Angiotensin II (Ang II) levels are increased in patients with diabetes, but mechanisms underlying its contribution to diabetic vascular diseases are incompletely understood. We recently reported that in aortic endothelial cells, Ang II induces endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) uncoupling to produce superoxide (O(2)*(-)) rather than nitric oxide (NO*), upon loss of the tetrahydrobiopterin (H(4)B) salvage enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). Here, we found that streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice had a marked increase in aortic O(2)*(-) production, which was inhibited by N-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride, indicating uncoupling of eNOS. Ang II receptor type 1 blocker candesartan or ACE inhibitor captopril markedly attenuated eNOS-derived O(2)*(-) and hydrogen peroxide production while augmenting NO* bioavailability in diabetic aortas, implicating recoupling of eNOS. O(2)*(-) and NO* production were characteristically and quantitatively measured by electron spin resonance. DHFR expression was decreased in diabetic aortas but significantly restored by candesartan or captopril. Either also improved vascular H(4)B content and endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation in diabetes. Rac1-dependent NAD(P)H oxidase (NOX) activity was more than doubled in the endothelium-denuded diabetic aortas but was attenuated by candesartan or captopril, indicating that NOX remains active in nonendothelial vascular tissues, although uncoupled eNOS is responsible for endothelial production of O(2)*(-). These data demonstrate a novel role of Ang II in diabetic uncoupling of eNOS and that Ang II-targeted therapy improves endothelial function via the novel mechanism of recoupling eNOS. Dual effectiveness on uncoupled eNOS and NOX may explain the high efficacy of Ang II antagonists in restoring endothelial function.", 
    "308": "Ramipril is an oral, non-sulfhydryl ACE inhibitor thought to act in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system to decrease vasopressor activity, aldosterone secretion, and bradykinin degradation. Ramipril is generally well tolerated and effective in the treatment of patients aged > or =55 years at high risk for the development of cardiovascular (CV) events, in whom the risk of myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and CV death can be significantly reduced. The risk of these CV outcomes may also be reduced with ramipril therapy in various subgroups; these include patients with diabetes mellitus, peripheral arterial disease (PAD) or renal insufficiency, and women. Thus, ramipril, in addition to lifestyle interventions, should be considered an important therapy in the prevention of CV outcomes in high-risk patients.", 
    "309": "Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a major public health problem that results in tremendous economic burden. Diastolic heart failure (DHF) forms an important subset with increasing incidence and prevalence. There are widely variable estimates of the prevalence, ranging from 13% to 74% of all CHF presentations, and this is predominantly a result of a lack of uniform criteria for establishing a diagnosis. New developments in management of DHF have lagged behind those for systolic heart failure (SHF), for which numerous new therapeutic and device strategies have been instituted. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays an important role in the pathophysiology of both SHF as well as DHF. The beneficial role of ACE inhibitors as well as aldosterone antagonists in SHF has been well established. Because of its unique role of the RAAS in establishing fibrosis at a molecular level, RAAS blockade provides an opportunity to expand the therapeutic options for DHF. Thus far, in patients with primary DHF only the angiotensin receptor type 1 antagonist candesartan has been reported to decrease morbidity and probably mortality. Large, ongoing randomized trials including TOPCAT (Trial of Aldosterone Antagonist Therapy in Adults with Preserved Ejection Fraction Congestive Heart) and the I-PRESERVE (Irbesartan in Heart Failure with Preserved Systolic Function) are currently underway to establish the role of aldosterone antagonists in patients with DHF.", 
    "310": "Angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor and may also contribute to the progression of atherosclerosis. In atheromatous lesions located in human coronary and carotid arteries, angiotensin-converting enzyme and angiotensin II levels are significantly increased. Angiotensin II is known to have proinflammatory actions in vascular tissues, inducing inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress. In particular, angiotensin II activates the potent cytoplasmic transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB, which regulates leukocyte adhesion molecules, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1, and interleukin (IL)-6, and contributes to the recruitment of circulating mononuclear leukocytes to the arterial intima. Olmesartan medoxomil has one of the highest degrees of antihypertensive efficacy among the angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists. In the EUTOPIA (EUropean Trial on Olmesartan and Pravastatin in Inflammation and Atherosclerosis) trial, olmesartan medoxomil significantly reduced serum levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, high-sensitivity TNFalpha, IL-6, and MCP-1, all of which are involved in promoting atherosclerosis. In a monkey atherosclerotic model, a 3-D intravascular ultrasound analysis of aortas showed that serum levels of MCP-1 and the degree of intimal hyperplasia were significantly lower after treatment with olmesartan medoxomil than before treatment. In VIOS (Vascular Improvement with Olmesartan Medoxomil Study), treatment with olmesartan medoxomil for 1 year, significantly reduced the wall-to-lumen ratio in arteries, whereas atenolol did not. Thus, olmesartan medoxomil, which rapidly reduces inflammatory markers, may have a beneficial antiatherosclerotic effect.",

The registered patients are randomized to one of two different BP levels and to initial antihypertensive regimens (i.e., calcium antagonist [Ca-A], angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor [ACE-I], or angiotensin II receptor antagonist [ARB]). At the end of February 2004, 2729, 1687, and 971 patients were recruited, randomized, and followed-up for 12 months or more. Among the 971 patients, mean systolic/diastolic BP levels at randomization in the Ca-A, ACE-I, and ARB groups were 150/90, 152/89, and 151/89 mmHg, respectively. These values reduced after six months of Ca-A-, ACE-I-, and ARB-based treatment (133/81 mmHg, 135/80 mmHg, and 134/79 mmHg, respectively) and further reduced after 12 months (131/80 mmHg, 134/79 mmHg, and 132/79 mmHg, respectively) without any significant differences among groups. In more intensive and less intensive BP-lowering groups, mean systolic/diastolic BP levels at randomization were 151/90 and 150/89 mmHg, respectively. Although BP levels reduced after 6-month (135/80 mmHg and 133/80 mmHg, respectively) and 12-month treatment (133/79 mmHg and 132/80 mmHg, respectively) in each target group, no significant difference in BP values was observed between groups.

Animals were exposed to 100 ppm arsenite as sodium arsenite in drinking water for six weeks followed by treatment with DMSA (50 mg/kg, orally), captopril (50 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) either alone or in combination, once daily for 5 consecutive days. Arsenite exposure led to a significant depletion of blood delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) activity, glutathione and platelet levels while significantly increased the level of reactive oxygen species (in RBCs). Hepatic reduced glutathione (GSH) level showed a significant decrease while, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) levels increased on arsenite exposure indicating arsenite induced hepatic oxidative stress. Kidney GSH, GSSG, catalase and TBARS remained unchanged on arsenite exposure. Treatment with DMSA was effective in increasing ALAD activity while, captopril was ineffective when given alone. Captopril when co-administered with DMSA also provided no additional beneficial effect on blood ALAD activity but significant brought altered platelet counts back to the normal value. In contrast, administration of captopril alone provided significant beneficial effects on hepatic oxidative stress, and in combination with DMSA provided a more pronounced recovery in the TBARS level compared to the individual effect of DMSA and captopril. Renal biochemical variables remained insensitive to arsenite and any of the treatments. Interestingly, combined administration of captopril with DMSA had a remarkable effect in depleting total arsenic concentration from blood and soft tissues. These results lead us to conclude that captopril administration during chelation treatment had some beneficial effects particularly on the protection of inhibited blood ALAD activity, and depletion of arsenic level. The study supports our earlier conclusion that a co-administration of an antioxidant is more beneficial than monotherapy with the chelating agents, in order to achieve optimal effects of chelation in arsenite toxicity.",

Proteinases-activated receptor 1 (PAR-1) is involved in many pathophysiologic processes after its activation by serine proteases. The aim of the present study was to determine messenger RNA (mRNA) production of TGF-beta1 and PAR-1 in the lungs after local irradiation. Mice of C57BL/6 and C3H/J strains with different susceptibility to fibrosis development were exposed to a of 15Gy. Non-irradiated mice of both strains were used as negative controls. Control (irradiated) and irradiated angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-treated animals were examined simultaneously. The ACE inhibitor group was given butylaminiperindopril for 9 days after irradiation (15Gy) at a daily dose of 0.1 or 0.2mg/kg per rectum. On day 9, all mice were sacrificed, and the production of mRNA TGF-beta1 and PAR-1 in lung tissue was determined semiquantitatively using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, and immunohistochemical analysis of PAR-1 expression in pulmonary tissue was performed. In the fibrosing murine strain C57Bl/6, there was an increase in the mRNA TGF-beta1 and PAR-1 levels in lungs 9 days after irradiation as compared with non-irradiated controls and non-fibrosing murine strain C3H/J. In butylaminiperindopril-treated mice, a decrease in transcript of TGF-beta1 and PAR-1 was observed. Thus, PAR-1 is involved in radiation-induced lung fibrosis in correlation with TGF-beta1 production. Administration of ACEI influences PAR-1 and TGF-beta1 expression.", 
    "319": "Variation in ACE activity is related to affect the skeletal muscle function. To elucidate the mechanism by which ACE affects skeletal muscle function, we examined the effects of loss and gain of ACE activity on myogenic differentiation in C2C12 myoblasts. The treatment of captopril, an ACE inhibitor, in differentiating cells significantly induced the up-regulation of myosin heavy chain, and the hypertrophic myotubes. In addition, an AT2 antagonist PD123319, not AT1 antagonist losartan, induced the up-regulation of myosin heavy chain. On the other hand, overexpression of ACE induced the down-regulation of myosin heavy chain. These results suggest that ACE negatively regulate the myogenesis through the mechanism at least in part via production of angiotensin II followed by its binding to AT2 receptor.",

In patients with chronic heart failure carvedilol improves left-ventricular (LV) ejection fraction over 6 to 12 months of treatment, and attenuates LV remodelling. Large-scale randomised, placebo controlled trials involving more than 4000 patients with chronic heart failure have demonstrated that carvedilol improves survival and reduces hospitalizations. Comparative studies with metoprolol in patients with heart failure have suggested that carvedilol may be associated with greater survival benefit although differences in the preparation of metoprolol have left uncertainty in this area. Carvedilol has a high safety profile and the clinical benefits appear maintained across a wide range of patients with comorbidities such as diabetes and renal failure. Carvedilol has also been shown to attenuate LV remodeling and improve clinical outcomes in patients with LV dysfunction and/or heart failure following acute myocardial infarction. As a result of these data, carvedilol is recommended for treatment of patients with heart failure in heart-failure guidelines. This evidence-based treatment should be widely implemented to ensure that patients with heart failure receive appropriate medical therapy.",

Factors such as hypertension, urinary tract infection, hematuria, and proteinuria may affect the progression to chronic renal failure in ADPKD patients. Therapeutic interventions, such as the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or diet modification, may impact the natural progression of the disease. We aim in this study to review a registry of ADPKD patients in order to compare the slow and fast progressors and identify possible predictors of progression and interventions that slow the progression of this disease. Sheffield Kidney Institute (SKI), one of the largest kidney institutes in Northern Europe, has registered a large number of ADPKD patients since 1981. SKI's computer network contains a wide range of information on these patients. We selected 94 adult polycystic patients from the SKI for retrospective analysis of factors affecting progression to chronic renal failure. Patients who doubled their s. creatinine in < or = 36 months were considered fast progressors (FP), while those who doubled their s. creatinine in > 36 months were regarded as slow progressors (SP). There were 70 patients in the FP group and 24 patients in the SP group. A third group of 137 patients consisted of non-progressors (NP) who had stable s. creatinine levels during the same period. We found that the incidence of hypertension, UTI, macroscopic and microscopic hematuria, and overt proteinuria in the FP group was higher than in the SP and NP groups. Modification of some factors, such as hypertension and UTI, may decrease the rate of the deterioration of renal function.",

We examine the effect of an orally administered, selective AT(1) receptor antagonist (losartan 50 mg) on sympathetically mediated vasoconstriction in healthy volunteers in an observer blind crossover study. Seven healthy, normotensive volunteers (21-32 years), were studied on two occasions at the end of each 6-week treatment period (losartan or placebo). Forearm blood flow (FABF) (ml/dl forearm/min) was measured by venous occlusion plethysmography during the application of lower body negative pressure (LBNP) (-20 cm H(2)O) and at the end of each incremental infusion of norepinephrine (60, 120, and 240 pmol/min). Comparison of blood flow changes was by repeated measures analysis of variance; P<0.05 was taken as statistically significant. Losartan did not alter blood pressure compared to placebo. It did significantly enhance LBNP-induced vasoconstriction in both the left arm compared to placebo (-36.6+/-3.4 vs -23.5+/-3.3%; P=0.017) and the right arm compared to placebo (-39.5+/-3.8 vs -21.0+/-3.6%; P=0.005). The FABF response to all doses of infused norepinephrine (60, 120, and 240 pmol/min) was also enhanced by losartan compared to placebo (-35.0+/-2.7 vs -18.2+/-6.0%; -43.6+/-4.3 vs -28.6+/-5.8%, and -53.9+/-3.2 vs -42.5+/-6.8%; P=0.057, respectively. Losartan enhances locally mediated sympathetic vasoconstriction in the forearm circulation of man, probably through its effect on circulating AII concentrations and we postulate that the adrenergic sympathetic constrictor action of AII is not mediated by the AT(1) receptor or is surmountable at this receptor.", 
    "333": "The renal and cardiac benefits of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibition in hypertension exceed those attributable to blood pressure reduction, and seem to involve mitochondrial function changes. To investigate whether mitochondrial changes associated with RAS inhibition are related to changes in nitric oxide (NO) metabolism, four groups of male Wistar rats were treated during 2 wk with a RAS inhibitor, enalapril (10 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1); Enal), or a NO synthase (NOS) inhibitor, N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) (1 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)), or both (Enal+L-NAME), or were untreated (control). Blood pressure and body weight were lower in Enal than in control. Electron transfer through complexes I to III and cytochrome oxidase activity were significantly lower, and uncoupling protein-2 content was significantly higher in kidney mitochondria isolated from Enal than in those from control. All of these changes were prevented by L-NAME cotreatment and were accompanied by a higher production/bioavailability of kidney NO. L-NAME abolished mitochondrial NOS activity but failed to inhibit extra-mitochondrial kidney NOS, underscoring the relevance of mitochondrial NO in those effects of enalapril that were suppressed by L-NAME cotreatment. In Enal, kidney mitochondria H(2)O(2) production rate and MnSOD activity were significantly lower than in control, and these effects were not prevented by L-NAME cotreatment. These findings may clarify the role of NO in the interactions between RAS and mitochondrial metabolism and can help to unravel the mechanisms involved in renal protection by RAS inhibitors.",

    "337": "The presence of proteinuria is a well-known risk factor for both the progression of renal disease and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and decreases in urine protein excretion level were associated with a slower decrease in renal function and decrease in risk of cardiovascular events. Increased blood pressure has a major role in the development of proteinuria in patients with either diabetic or nondiabetic kidney disease, and all recent guidelines recommend a blood pressure goal less than 130/80 mm Hg in patients with proteinuria to achieve maximal renal and cardiovascular protection. Drugs interfering with the renin-angiotensin system, ie, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, should be used as first-line antihypertensive therapy in patients with proteinuria because they seem to have a blood pressure-independent antiproteinuric effect, and if blood pressure levels are still out of goal, a diuretic should be added to this regimen. A combination of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor with an angiotensin receptor blocker or other classes of medications shown to decrease protein excretion, such as nondihydropyridine calcium antagonists or aldosterone receptor blockers, should be considered to decrease proteinuria further. This review provides an extended summary of current evidence regarding the associations of blood pressure with proteinuria, the rationale for currently recommended blood pressure goals, and the use of various classes of antihypertensive agents in proteinuric patients.",

However, the mechanism of the beneficial action of statins on cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis remains unclear. We have now investigated this action of pitavastatin in Dahl salt-sensitive (DS) rats. 2. The DS rats progressively develop marked hypertension when fed a diet containing 8% NaCl from 7 weeks of age. These animals exhibited pronounced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, as well as upregulation of fetal-type cardiac gene expression at 12 weeks of age, compared with DS rats fed a diet containing 0.3% NaCl. The abundance of mRNAs for collagen types I and III, angiotensin-converting enzyme, transforming growth factor-beta1 and connective tissue growth factor was also increased in the heart of rats on the high-salt diet. 3. Treatment of rats on the high-salt diet with a non-antihypertensive dose of pitavastatin (0.3 or 1 mg/kg per day) from 7 to 12 weeks of age attenuated the development of cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, as well as inhibiting the upregulation of cardiac gene expression. Pitavastatin also blocked the translocation of RhoA to the membrane fraction of the left ventricle and RhoA activation, as well as the phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-1 and ERK-2 and an increase in the DNA binding activity of serum response factor (SRF) in the heart induced by the high-salt diet. 4. These findings suggest that the effects of pitavastatin on load-induced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis are independent of its cholesterol-lowering action and may be mediated, at least in part, through inhibition of RhoA-ERK-SRF signalling.",

    "341": "In the past 10 years, many widely accepted concepts relating to aldosterone production and its pathogenetic role have changed. We now know that aldosterone is produced not only by the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex, but also in the heart, blood vessels, kidney and brain; such extra-epithelial production occurs mainly during tissue repair. Also, increased aldosterone levels contribute to vessel inflammation, oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction and organ damage. As such, aldosterone has a key role in the development of myocardial fibrosis. Anti-aldosterone treatment has proven effective in patients with heart failure. Experimental evidence regarding the role of aldosterone in kidney damage has accumulated. Aldosterone infusion can counteract the beneficial effects of treatment with angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, causing more-severe proteinuria and an increased number of vascular and glomerular lesions; treatment with aldosterone antagonists can reverse these alterations. Preliminary observations in pilot studies in humans confirm the experimental findings, supporting the hypothesis that aldosterone antagonists are renoprotective in clinical practice. Studies in larger populations with longer follow-up are needed to confirm this theory.", 
    "342": "Despite the worldwide epidemic of chronic kidney disease complicating diabetes mellitus, current therapies directed against nephroprogression are limited to angiotensin conversion or receptor blockade. Nonetheless, additional therapeutic possibilities are slowly emerging. The diversity of therapies currently in development reflects the pathogenic complexity of diabetic nephropathy. The three most important candidate drugs currently in development include a glycosaminoglycan, a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor and an inhibitor of advanced glycation. In targeting primary mechanisms by which hyperglycaemia contributes to diabetic complications, these drugs could provide risk reduction complementary to the partial reduction proven for ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists (angiotensin receptor blockers). Glycosaminoglycans act to restore glycoproteins present in reduced amounts in the glomerular basement membrane and mesangium of diabetic animal models. Components of the drug sulodexide prevent pathological changes and proteinuria in diabetic rats. Reductions in albuminuria, a hallmark of early diabetic kidney disease, have been reported in initial human trials. In the US, a multicentre phase II study has been completed, with an interim analysis indicating reduction in urinary albumin losses. Pivotal phase II trials have begun in patients with type 2 diabetes. A second metabolic pathway of diabetic complications is overexpression of PKC. Several activators of this family of intracellular kinases have been identified and PKC activation may result in tissue damage through a variety of mechanisms. In animal models, the inhibitor ruboxistaurin reduces albuminuria, diabetic histological changes and kidney injury. Like sulodexide, drug development of ruboxistaurin has reached completion of a phase II evaluation with mixed results. The third metabolic target is the nonenzymatic formulation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) through well described biochemical pathways. Multiple pathways lead to AGE accumulation in tissues in diabetes and diverse AGE products are formed. AGE deposition has been implicated in animal models of diabetic nephropathy. The leading AGE inhibitor currently in development is pyridoxamine, which has multiple actions that inhibit glycation. Pyridoxamine is an efficient AGE inhibitor in experimental diabetes. A phase II study in diabetic patients with nephropathy reported mixed efficacy results and a favourable safety profile. Phase III evaluation of pyridoxamine has not begun. These three classes of potential therapies, if successfully developed, will confirm that diabetic kidney disease has entered the era of biochemical treatments.",

There is almost no method to trace small molecules including medicine. Here, we used QDs for fluorescent tracers for medicine and analyzed their kinetics and dynamics. We conjugated QDs with captopril, anti-hypertensive medicine, by an exchange reaction while retaining the medicinal properties. We investigated the medicinal effect of QD-conjugated captopril (QD-cap) in vitro and in vivo. We also evaluated the concentration and the distribution of the QD-cap in the blood and the organs with their fluorescence. We demonstrate that the QD-cap inhibits the activity of ACE in vitro. The QD-cap reduced the blood pressure of hypertensive model rats. The concentration of the QD-cap in the blood was measured by using the standard curve of the fluorescence intensity. The blood concentration of the QD-cap decrease exponentially and QD-cap has approximately the same half-life as that of captopril. In addition, the fluorescence of the QDs revealed that QD-cap accumulates in the liver, lungs, and spleen. We succeeded in analyzing the dynamics and kinetics of small molecules using fluorescence of QDs.",

At baseline, patients carrying at least 1 allele of the Glu27 variant presented with a larger cardiac size despite similar blood pressure levels (142.9 +/- 22.5 g/m(2) in Glu27 carriers versus 138.2 +/- 18.4 g/m(2) in Gln27 carriers, P < .02). Blood pressure normalization was achieved by both drugs. At follow-up, compared with the Gln27 patients, the Glu27 patients showed a larger reduction in hypertrophy when treated with enalapril (percent change in left ventricular mass, -6.3% +/- 7.7% in Glu27 carriers versus -2.18% +/- 7.9% in Gln27 carriers; P < .05) but not with atenolol therapy (-2.8% +/- 8.9% in Glu27 carriers versus -2.4% +/- 8.8% in Gln27 carriers, P = not significant). In in vitro studies the activation of p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK-) 1/2 (data not shown) and the activity of the atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) promoter after isoproterenol (INN, isoprenaline) stimulation were larger in Glu27 beta(2)AR overexpressing cells than in Gln27 beta(2)AR overexpressing cells (fold difference compared with unstimulated cells, 9.7 +/- 2.9 for Glu27 beta(2)AR versus 4.2 +/- 0.3 for Gln27 beta(2)AR; P < .05).",

We evaluated differences in clinical characteristics, outcomes, and response to milrinone therapy in African American patients compared with Caucasians. The primary end point of OPTIME-CHF was days hospitalized for cardiovascular causes or death within 60 days of randomization. Thirty-three percent (n = 310) of patients were African American. African American patients were younger (57 vs. 70 years, P < .0001) and more likely to have non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (74% vs. 36%, P < .0001). In unadjusted analysis, African American patients had a lower 60-day mortality (5% vs. 12%, P = .0004) and tended to have better overall clinical outcomes. After adjustment for baseline differences, however, these differences were no longer significant. We found no differential effect of milrinone therapy by race.",

Patients receiving any medications had lower unadjusted mortality rates compared to patients not receiving any medications (7.9% vs. 11.5%; p = 0.03). In multivariable analysis, receipt of any cardioprotective medication remained associated with lower all-cause mortality (OR 0.65; 95% CI 0.43-0.99). Among patients receiving cardioprotective medications, the majority (80.3%) were adherent (PDC > or = 0.80). Adherent patients had lower unadjusted mortality rates (6.7% vs. 12.1%; p < 0.01). In multivariable analysis, medication adherence remained associated with lower all-cause mortality (OR 0.52; 95% CI 0.39-0.69) compared to non-adherence.

    "427": "The human hemorphin LVV-H7 (L32VVYPWTQRF41) is a hemoglobin-beta, -gamma, -delta or -epsilon chain derived cationic decapeptide of the micro-opioid receptor binding family. It exhibits potential pharmacological value relevant, for example, for blood pressure regulation, learning performance and Alzheimer's disease. The regulatory potency is strictly dependent on the length of the amino acid sequence which is sensitive towards proteinases from tissues and plasma. To analyse LVV-H7 in vitro degradation in mammalian plasma, a novel multi-component quantitative capillary zone electrophoretic (CZE) procedure was applied, combined with qualitative metabolite profiling by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). In all types of plasma, LVV-H7 was N-terminally truncated generating four metabolites (M1-M4) with an intact C-terminus: M1 (V33VYPWTQRF41), M2 (V34YPWTQRF41), M3 (Y35PWTQRF41) and M4 (W37TQRF41). In EDTA plasma these degradation products were detected exclusively, whereas in citrate and heparin plasma four further metabolites appeared resulting from additional C-terminal cleavage of the dipeptide R40F41: M5 (L32VVYPWTQ39), M6 (V33VYPWTQ39), M7 (V34YPWTQ39) and M8 (Y35PWTQ39). In the presence of selective proteinase inhibitors aminopeptidase M and angiotensin-converting enzyme (for N- and C-terminal truncation, respectively) were identified as plasma enzymes responsible for hemorphin degradation. Furthermore, striking inter-mammalian species distinctions were detected revealing strongly differing degradation velocities but similar metabolite patterns.", 
    "428": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with increased cardiovascular (CV) risk. Left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy (LVH), together with coronary artery disease, has been considered the main target of intervention. LVH is highly prevalent in CKD even in early stages, as compared to general non-selected population. This is mainly due to the multifactorial pathogenesis of LVH in renal patients where both haemodynamic and non-haemodynamic stimuli synergically act inducing either an increase in left ventricular mass or an LV dilation. Anaemia and arterial hypertension seem to be the most important factors. Interventional studies have shown that partial correction of anaemia through epoetin, together with an arterial hypertension successful therapy through renin-angiotensin system acting drugs, such as ACE-inhibitors, were able to induce a LVH regression in CKD. Indeed, the unfavourable outcome in patients with both CKD and LVH, whose survival is reduced and incidence of fatal and non-fatal CV events increased, can be reversed if LVH is regressed by therapy. The most promising strategy in CKD seems to be LVH early diagnosis through echocardiography, the correct screening of risk factors, a LVM longitudinal monitoring through echo, as well as starting treatment in the early stages of CKD, with the aim of improving general and CV prognosis for these patients.",

    "433": "The main aims of the treatment of chronic heart failure are to improve and to maintain the quality of life, to increase duration of life, to decrease mortality, to prevent diseases leading to the heart failure development, and to prevent the progression of heart failure. Diuretics are the drugs of first choice for the treatment of congestive heart failure. They can improve the quality of patient's life quite quickly. Noncompliance to methodological diuretic use can cause a serious damage such as metabolic disorders, arrhythmias, and even sudden death. Loop diuretics are the drugs of choice. Resistance to diuretics occurs in 10-20% of the cases during the course of treatment; therefore, drug combination as well as dose modification is required. Diuretics are not recommended to use alone for a symptomatic relief. They are prescribed in combination with beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, and/or angiotensin receptor blockers for a continuous pathogenetic therapy of congestive heart failure. Digoxin in combination with diuretics is the drug of choice for treatment of heart failure when tachyarrhythmia or severe systolic left ventricular dysfunction appears or it is impossible to administer beta-blockers. In this article, the guidelines of European Society of Cardiology and also American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association for the symptomatic management of congestive heart failure, updated in 2005, are reviewed.",

Arterial hypertension is associated with such adverse effects as accelerated arteriosclerosis and pathological left ventricular hypertrophy, among others. The molecular mechanisms affecting left ventricular hypertrophy remain mostly unknown. The advent of proteome profiling has facilitated the elucidation of disease-associated proteins, paving the way for molecular diagnostics and the identification of novel therapeutic targets. We explored the proteomic profile of pathological left ventricular hypertrophy in comparison with normal heart in a model of rats and investigated the proteomic changes in response to different antihypertensive regimens in order to elucidate their cardioprotective effects.

A cross-sectional analysis was conducted using data from a national network of electronic health records for 2 groups with newly diagnosed hypertension and started on antihypertensive medications: one a year before and the other a year after the publication of ALLHAT. The percentage of new hypertensives started on thiazides increased from 29% pre-ALLHAT to 39% post-ALLHAT. An increase was also seen for angiotensin receptor blockers, while prescribing for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and beta-blockers declined. There was no significant change in prescriptions for alpha-blockers. Prescriptions for thiazides for patients with newly diagnosed hypertension increased after the publication of ALLHAT. Data from large national trials can have a considerable impact on prescribing practices.", 
    "437": "Increasing knowledge of the role of nitric oxide (NO) in physiology and disease has stimulated efforts to target the NO pathway pharmacologically. These therapeutic strategies include NO donors that directly or indirectly release NO and agents that increase NO bioactivity. Traditional organic nitrates such as nitroglycerin, which indirectly release NO, were believed to have limited long-term efficacy and tolerability, chiefly because of nitrate tolerance. Recent studies, however, suggest more effective ways of using these agents and new applications for them. Nicorandil, a hybrid organic nitrate that also activates potassium channels, has demonstrated significant benefits in acute coronary syndromes. Other nitrates are being investigated for use in neurodegenerative diseases. Direct NO donors include NO gas, which is useful in respiratory disorders, and the more recent classes of diazeniumdiolates, sydnonimines, and S-nitrosothiols. Preliminary data suggest that these agents may be effective as antiatherosclerotic agents as well as in other disease states. In addition, hybrid agents that consist of an NO donor coupled with a parent anti-inflammatory drug, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, have demonstrated enhanced efficacy and tolerability compared with the anti-inflammatory parent drug alone in diverse experimental models. Established drugs that enhance NO bioactivity include antihypertensive agents, particularly angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and newer vasodilating beta-blockers. In addition, 3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) promote NO bioactivity, both through and independent of lipid lowering. The NO-promoting actions of these established drugs provide some insight into their known benefits and suggest possible therapeutic potential.", 
    "438": "Nitric oxide (nitrogen monoxide) (NO) plays an important role in a wide range of physiologic processes. A major mediator of endothelial function, NO regulates vasodilatory and antithrombotic actions in the vasculature and plays a role in reproductive functions, bronchodilation, bone formation, memory, insulin sensitivity, and gastrointestinal relaxation. NO is formed from NO synthase. Impaired NO bioactivity is strongly associated with endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular disease, but is also implicated in a broad range of other disorders, including pulmonary hypertension, insulin resistance, erectile dysfunction, and preeclampsia. Numerous therapies designed to target NO are being investigated and developed, including NO donors and stimulants. The recent African-American Heart Failure Trial (A-HeFT) showed that the NO donor isosorbide dinitrate, combined with the vasodilator hydralazine, significantly reduced morbidity and mortality in black patients with moderate-to-severe heart failure. Antihypertensive drugs, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and third-generation beta-blockers, are NO stimulants that have demonstrated significant improvement of endothelial function and NO bioactivity. Other cardiovascular therapies that may improve NO bioactivity include statins, l-arginine, and nonpharmacologic approaches such as exercise and dietary changes.",

The authors analyzed, by sex and age groups, a registry of 4280 community patients initiating carvedilol for HF. Women (n=1485) were older than men (n=2793) and had worse functional class with higher left ventricular ejection fraction and blood pressure. Women also had more HF hospitalizations, less use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and lower doses of carvedilol. Nevertheless, during 1-year follow-up, both groups experienced greater than 40% reductions in HF hospitalizations (P<.001), with mortality of 7.3% in women vs 9.1% in men (P=.085). With increasing age, left ventricular ejection fraction, blood pressure, and functional class increased, whereas angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor use and carvedilol doses decreased. HF hospitalizations fell at least 40% in all age groups after starting carvedilol (P<.001). Characteristics of women and the elderly with HF in the community suggest increased risk, but both populations respond well after initiating carvedilol.", 
    "440": "The aim of the present study was to investigate whether pharmacological enhancement of the renal kallikrein-kinin system using the vasopeptidase inhibitor omapatrilat plays a direct role in modulating the fibrotic responses of human mesangial cells to injury. Treatment with 40 micromol/L omapatrilat was able to reduce macrophage-conditioned medium (MPCM)-induced fibronectin levels without affecting mRNA expression. MPCM injury also suppressed kallikrein and low molecular weight kininogen mRNA. Omapatrilat was able to attenuate this suppression. Bradykinin levels in contrast were increased by MPCM and treatment with omapatrilat further augmented levels. Co-incubation with the bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist HOE 140 attenuated the omapatrilat-induced lowering of fibronectin. Moreover, inhibition of cGMP release had a similar effect. Paradoxically, RT-PCR and Southern blotting demonstrated that bradykinin B2 receptor mRNA levels were down regulated in response to omapatrilat. Western blotting supported this data. Supernatant levels of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), a product of bradykinin stimulation, were decreased by omapatrilat while cell associated tPA levels were increased. Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) mRNA expression was up regulated by omapatrilat treatment, although no difference in active zymogen levels was observed. In conclusion enhancement of kallikrein-kinin system appears to play a direct role in promoting anti-fibrotic responses in MPCM-injured human mesangial cells.",

AGT and ACE mRNA and their protein levels were 2- to 3-fold higher in atheroma and in MIT of T2D patients. VSMCs from T2D patients had respectively 2.5- and 5-fold higher AGT and AT1R mRNA and protein contents. Insulin induced an increase in AGT and AT1R mRNA with similar ED50. These responses were blocked by PD98059, an inhibitor of MAP-kinase in the two groups whereas wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI3-kinase, partially prevented the response in CTR patients. Phosphorylated ERK1-2 was 4-fold higher in MIT from T2D than from CTR patients.",

    "444": "Endothelial dysfunction has been identified as a major mechanism involved in all the stages of atherogenesis. Evaluation of endothelial function seems to have a predictive role in humans, and therapeutic interventions improving nitric oxide bioavailability in the vasculature may improve the long-term outcome in healthy individuals, high-risk subjects, or patients with advanced atherosclerosis. Several therapeutic strategies are now available, targeting both the synthesis and oxidative inactivation of nitric oxide (NO) in human vasculature. Statins seem to be currently the most powerful category of these agents, improving endothelial function and decreasing cardiovascular risk after long-term administration. Other cardiovascular agents improving endothelial function in humans are angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptors blockers, which increase NO bioavailability by modifying the rennin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Newer therapeutic approaches targeting endothelial dysfunction in specific disease states include insulin sensitizers, L-arginine (the substrate for endothelial NO synthase [eNOS]) as well as substances that target eNOS \"coupling,\" such as folates or tetrahydrobiopterin. Although there are a variety of strategies to improve NO bioavailability in human endothelium, it is still unclear whether they have any direct benefit at a clinical level.",

Special populations may have additional screening indications. Management of patients who have coronary artery disease includes antiplatelet therapy; aggressive lipid lowering; management of hypertension with beta blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors; risk factor management, including smoking cessation, diet, and exercise; symptom management; and sometimes revascularization.

No efficacious therapy is currently available, and vaccines and drugs are under development to prevent SARS-CoV infection in many countries. The CoV main protease (M(pro)), which plays a pivotal role in viral gene expression and replication through a highly complex cascade involving the proteolytic processing of replicase polyproteins, is an attractive target for drug design. This review summarizes the recent advances in biological and structural studies, together with development of inhibitors targeting CoV M(pro)s.

    "456": "Morbidity and mortality of chronic liver disease are primarily caused by liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension, both of them secondary disorders of progressive liver fibrosis. The main fibrogenic cell type in the liver, the hepatic stellate cell (HSC), is activated and stimulated by several factors, among which the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays a major role. Angiotensin II induces various profibrotic pathways via the angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT(1) receptor) not only in heart and kidney, but also in liver tissue. Stimulation of the AT(1) receptor promotes the transformation of the quiescent HSC into the myofibroblast like activated HSC and the synthesis of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta), the major profibrotic cytokine in the liver. In addition, aldosterone has been suggested to induce profibrotic effects in chronic heart and liver disease. This review focuses on the concept that inhibitors of the RAAS retard or even reverse liver fibrosis and reduce portal hypertension. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, AT(1) receptor antagonists, and aldosterone antagonists have been demonstrated to reduce the proliferation of HSC, to decrease the synthesis of profibrotic molecules, and to have the potential to improve liver fibrosis. However, side-effects such as systemic hypotension may impair the clinical application of RAAS inhibitors in patients with liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Also, efficacy may be limited by the downregulation of AT(1) receptors in advanced fibrosis, which has been observed in animal and human studies. Randomized clinical studies are essential to evaluate, whether this approach is beneficial in patients with chronic liver disease and progressive fibrosis.", 
    "457": "Essential fatty acids (EFAs): cis-linoleic acid (LA) and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) are essential for humans and their deficiency is rare in humans due to their easy availability in diet. EFAs are metabolized to their respective long-chain metabolites: dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA), and arachidonic acid (AA) from LA; and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) from ALA. Some of these long-chain metabolites form precursors to respective prostaglandins (PGs), thromboxanes (TXs), and leukotrienes (LTs), lipoxins (LXs) and resolvins. EFAs and their metabolites may function as endogenous angiotensin converting enzyme and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, nitric oxide enhancers, anti-hypertensives, and anti-atherosclerotic molecules. EFAs react with nitric oxide (NO) to yield respective nitroalkene derivatives that have cell-signaling actions via ligation and activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). In several diseases such as obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, alcoholism, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, atherosclerosis, and cancer the metabolism of EFAs is altered.

These measurements can be used to diagnose heart failure, including diastolic dysfunction, and using them has been shown to save money in the emergency department setting. The high negative predictive value of BNP tests is particularly helpful for ruling out heart failure. Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-II receptor blockers, spironolactone, and diuretics reduces BNP levels, suggesting that BNP testing may have a role in monitoring patients with heart failure. However, patients with treated chronic stable heart failure may have levels in the normal range (i.e., BNP less than 100 pg per mL and N-terminal proBNP less than 125 pg per mL in patients younger than 75 years). Increases in BNP levels may be caused by intrinsic cardiac dysfunction or may be secondary to other causes such as pulmonary or renal diseases (e.g., chronic hypoxia). BNP tests are correlated with other measures of cardiac status such as New York Heart Association classification. BNP level is a strong predictor of risk of death and cardiovascular events in patients previously diagnosed with heart failure or cardiac dysfunction.",

    "476": "In unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO), the kidney is characterized by increased fibrosis and apoptosis. Both transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and ANG II have been implicated, and ANG II may mediate its effects through TGF-beta. Previous studies demonstrated amelioration of renal damage when either TGF-beta or ANG II has been individually targeted. In this study, we sought to determine whether combining 1D11 (monoclonal antibody to TGF-beta) and an ACE inhibitor, enalapril, would be more effective in UUO than either individual treatment, as has been shown in diabetic and glomerulonephritic models. Rats underwent UUO and were given either control monoclonal antibody, 1D11 or enalapril, or 1D11/enalapril combination, for 14 days. Kidneys were harvested and examined for fibrosis [trichrome; collagen (real-time PCR, Sircol assay) and fibroblast-specific protein expression (immunohistochemistry), apoptosis (TUNEL), macrophage infiltration (immunohistochemistry), and TGF-beta expression (real-time PCR and tubular localization with immunohistochemistry)]. UUO was found to induce fibrosis, apoptosis, macrophage infiltration, and TGF-beta expression in the obstructed kidney. Administration of either 1D11 or enalapril individually significantly decreased all these changes; when 1D11 and enalapril were combined, there was little additive effect, and the combination did not provide full protection against damage. The results demonstrate that, for the most part, combination therapy is not additive in UUO. This could be due to the continued presence of a physical obstruction or to biochemical differences between UUO and other renal disease models. Furthermore, it suggests that other targets may be amenable to pharmacological manipulation in UUO.", 
    "477": "A burgeoning body of evidence suggests that endothelin-1 (ET-1), the most potent endogenous vasoconstrictor yet identified, may be critical in the pathophysiology of various cardiovascular diseases. The ET system may also be implicated in the pathogenesis of cerebral vasospasm after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Clinical studies have shown that the levels of ET-1 are increased in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients following SAH, suggesting that ET-1-mediated vasoconstriction plays a major role in the development of vasospasm after SAH. The potential involvement of ETs in SAH-induced vasospasm has triggered considerable interest in developing therapeutic strategies that inhibit the biologic effects of ET. One promising approach to block the biosynthesis of ETs is suppressing the proteolytic conversion of the precursor peptide (big ET-1) to its vasoactive form (ET-1) using metalloprotease as endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE) inhibitor. To date, three types of ECE-1 inhibitors have been synthesized: dual ECE-1/neutral endopeptidase 24.11 (NEP) inhibitors, triple ECE-1/NEP/angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and selective ECE-1 inhibitors. The therapeutic effects of ECE-1 inhibitors on the prevention and reversal of SAH-induced vasospasm in animal studies are reviewed and discussed.", 
    "478": "The genetic basis of tropical calcific pancreatitis (TCP) is different and is explained by mutations in the pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor (SPINK1) gene. However, mutated SPINK1 does not account for the disease in all the patients, neither does it explain the phenotypic heterogeneity between TCP and fibro-calculous pancreatic diabetes (FCPD). Recent studies suggest a crucial role for pancreatic renin-angiotensin system during chronic hypoxia in acute pancreatitis and for angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in reducing pancreatic fibrosis in experimental models. We investigated the association of ACE gene insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism in TCP patients using a case-control approach. Since SPINK1 mutations are proposed a modifier role, we also investigated its interaction with the ACE gene variant.",

How- ever, while SOJA is a very important advance in drug selection for formulary purposes, it is hospital based and can only be applied to one indication at a time. In SOJA, cost has been given a primary role in the selection process as it has been included as a selection criterion from the start. Cost may therefore drive the selection of a particular drug product at the expense of other basic criteria such as safety or efficacy. The aims of this study were to use a modified SOJA approach in the selection of ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) for use in a joint formulary that bridges primary and secondary care within a health board in Northern Ireland, and to investigate the potential impact of the joint formulary on prescribing costs of ACEIs in that health board.", 
    "487": "The modified SOJA approach involved four phases in sequence: an evidence-based pharmacotherapeutic evaluation of all available ACEI drug entities, a separate safety/risk assessment analysis of products containing agents that exceeded the pharmacotherapeutic threshold, a budget-impact analysis and, finally, the selection of product lines. A comprehensive literature review and expert panel judgement informed the selection of criteria (and their relative weighting) for the pharmacotherapeutic evaluation. The resultant criteria/scoring system was circulated (in questionnaire format) to prescribers and stakeholders for comment. Based on statistical analysis of the latter survey results, the final scoring system was developed. Drug entities that exceeded the evidence threshold were sequentially entered into the second and third phases of the process.", 
    "488": "Five drug entities (11 currently available in the UK) exceeded the evidence threshold and 22 of 26 submitted product lines containing these drug entities satisfied the safety/risk assessment criteria.

The primary efficacy parameter was the reduction in diastolic blood pressure. Effects on systolic blood pressure, heart rate, biochemical variables, adverse events and quality of life were studied as secondary efficacy parameters.",

The reduction in diastolic blood pressure on amlodipine was significantly greater than on bendroflumethiazide 1.25 mg/day and enalapril 10 mg/day (p = 0.013). The percentage of patients achieving a diastolic blood pressure of < 95 mm Hg was 34% (SD 4.4) with bendroflumethiazide 1.25 mg/day, 48% (SD 6.5) with bendroflumethiazide 2.5 mg/day (p = 0.075 vs bendroflumethiazide 1.25 mg/day), 57% (SD 6.3) with amlodipine 5 mg/day (p = 0.004 vs bendroflumethiazide 1.25 mg/day) and 41% (SD 6.4) with enalapril 10 mg/day (p = 0.41 vs bendroflumethiazide 1.25 mg/day) [mean reductions]. The effect on systolic blood pressure was similar with all treatments. No clinically significant changes occurred in heart rate, serum potassium, blood glucose, serum urate or serum cholesterol levels. The incidences of adverse events were similar in the low-dose bendroflumethiazide groups, with significantly higher incidences in the enalapril and amlodipine groups. Quality of life was similar in the different treatment groups, but the study had limited power to detect any difference in this parameter.",

The addition of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) to her antihypertensive treatment resulted in a dramatic improvement of renal function during the following three months. When the patient discontinued MMF treatment, end-stage renal failure rapidly developed. This patient represents the first report of the beneficial use of MMF in non-immune chronic renal disease and demonstrates that significant functional improvement may be obtained with the addition of MMF to the treatment of hypertensive nephrosclerosis for patients in whom there is significant tubulointerstitial inflammatory infiltration.", 
    "496": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) displays potent vasoconstrictive effects, attenuation of fibrinolysis, and platelet activation and aggregation. Recently it was mentioned that the insertion/deletion polymorphism of the ACE gene is associated with ESRD. The lengthy course of IgA Nephropathy (IgAN) and the possibility of good outcomes without therapy suggest nontoxic therapies such as ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). However, the correlation between the ACE gene polymorphism and progression of IgAN still requires further approval. Here, the author performs a summative analysis on the recent previous reports on the ACE gene polymorphism and its correlation to progression of IgAN. The meta-analysis was performed to assess the correlation between the pattern of ACE gene polymorphism and progression of IgAN. From five available studies, 346 and 555 patients with (group 1) and without (group 2) the progression of disease are evaluated. According to this study, the frequency of DD genotype in group 1 is significant higher than group 2 (p < 0.05).

The importance of micronutrient deficiencies in the pathophysiologic expression of congestive heart failure (CHF) in AAs remains to be explored, including hypovitaminosis D, which can promote secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT), together with hypozincemia and hyposelenemia, the 2 most crucial trace minerals integral to diverse biologic functions. Serum parathyroid hormone (PTH), 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), Zn, and Se were monitored in 30 AAs hospitalized during June through December 2005, with decompensated failure and reduced ejection fraction (EF) (<35%) of predominantly nonischemic origin treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), furosemide, and spironolactone. Based on their symptomatic status before hospitalization, 15 patients were stratified as having protracted (>or=4 weeks) CHF, whereas 15 patients had short-term (1-2 weeks) CHF. These hospitalized patients were compared with 10 AA outpatients with stable, similarly treated compensated failure and comparable EF, and 9 AA normal volunteers without cardiovascular disease. Serum PTH was elevated in all patients with protracted CHF and in 60% of patients with short-term CHF, but not in compensated patients or normal volunteers. However, serum 25(OH)D was reduced in all patients with >or=4 weeks and 80% with either 1-2 weeks CHF or compensated failure compared with volunteers. Serum Zn was below normal in 11 of 15 patients with protracted CHF, in 8 of 15 patients with shorter duration CHF, and in 5 of 10 patients with compensated failure. Serum Se was reduced in all patients with >or=4 weeks, 60% with short-term CHF, and 90% of compensated patients. Concomitant to hypovitaminosis D, hypozincemia, and hyposelenemia, SHPT is a covariant of CHF in housebound AAs.", 
    "498": "Impaired fibrinolytic function, characterized by increased plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) levels and decreased tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) activity, has been found in patients with hypertension and may account in part for the increased risk of atherosclerosis and its clinical complications in these patients. Failure to correct this prothrombotic state may be one of the possible reasons for the disappointing effect of antihypertensive treatment on the incidence of coronary events. In this regard, data from the literature indicate that different antihypertensive drugs may vary in their influence on fibrinolysis. Scarce and conflicting data exist regarding the effects of diuretics and beta-blockers on the fibrinolytic system. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (ACE-I) have generally been shown to improve the fibrinolytic balance by reducing plasma PAI-1 levels, calcium channel blockers (CCB) have been reported to increase t-PA activity, and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) seem to be neutral in their effect. Interesting data have been reported about the positive impact on fibrinolysis of combining an ACE-I with a CCB, which resulted in a decrease of PAI-1 caused by ACE inhibition, and an increase in t-PA resulting from calcium channel blockade. The positive effect of ACE-I on the fibrinolytic system has been related to: 1) inhibition of angiotensin II, which stimulates PAI-1 expression; 2) inhibition of degradation of bradykinin, a potent stimulus for tPA production; and 3) improvement of insulin sensitivity. The mechanisms underlying the CCB effect on t-PA are less clear, but a direct action of CCB on vascular endothelium has been reported to play a major role. The greater improvement in the fibrinolytic balance because of the combined action of ACE inhibition and Ca antagonism represents a further indication to the use of combinations of ACE-I and CCB in the treatment of hypertension.",

In this study, a 70% surgical reduction in kidney mass (RK) was used to decrease baseline GFR and to prevent hyperfiltration during diabetes, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) were used to inhibit angiotensin II (AngII) production, to test the hypothesis that a balance between GFR and AngII is required for normal BP early in diabetes. Diabetes was induced with streptozotocin (STZ) (35 mg/kg intravenously); and after 7 days of hyperglycemia (range: 408 to 486 mg/dL), insulin was intravenously infused continuously for a 4-day normoglycemic recovery period. In normal kidney (NK) rats, diabetes increased PRA (2.4 +/- 0.6 to 4.6 +/- 0.5 ngAI/mL/h) and GFR (2.9 +/- 0.1 to 3.5 +/- 0.2 mL/min), and there was no change in mean arterial pressure (MAP) (89 +/- 1 v 91 +/- 1 mm Hg, measured 18 h/day). There was no change in either GFR or AngII during diabetes in RK+ACEI rats, and their MAP also did not change. Thus, the maintenance of normal MAP was accompanied by a balance between GFR and AngII in both of those groups. In NK+ACEI rats, however, GFR increased significantly with no change in AngII, and MAP decreased significantly during diabetes by approximately 8 mm Hg. In RK rats, PRA increased (0.5 +/- 0.1 to 2.6 +/- 0.5) but GFR did not increase, and MAP increased significantly by approximately 16 mm Hg. All rats were in sodium balance by day 4 of diabetes. These data support the hypothesis that normotension early in diabetes requires a balance between the increased AngII and GFR, and that BP will increase if AngII increases but GFR does not.",

Making use of the substrate Abz-FRK-(Dnp)P-OH and the specific inhibitor captopril at 10 microM, ACE activity was determined in a fluorescence assay for intact larvae, hemolymph, head, midgut and dorsal tissue. In dorsal tissue and hemolymph, ACE activity was highest. These data are consistent with a possible role for ACE in contractions of the dorsal vessel and metabolism of circulating peptide hormones in the hemolymph. After the presence of ACE was confirmed, a sequential procedure of anion exchange and size exclusion chromatography was applied to purify ACE from whole wandering larvae (last stage). With this procedure, three different ACE pools were collected that cleaved the fluorogenic substrate Abz-FRK-(Dnp)P-OH. Activity could be inhibited by a final concentration of 2.5 microM captopril. In addition, two out of three samples eluted at different salt concentration and thus ACE 1, 2 and 3 represent at least two different ACE isoforms.

We also evaluated the mesenteric and plasmatic Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE), renal function, lipid plasmatic content, and insulin and glucose metabolism. Intrauterine undernutrition induced hypertension and increased response of mesenteric arterioles to Ang II and decreased vasodilation to Bk and Ach. The treatments with losartan or enalapril normalized the blood pressure levels and significantly improved the arteriolar responses to Bk, Ach and reduced the response to Ang II.

In 3 open-label studies in which blood pressure was assessed with ambulatory measurement, aliskiren was administered to patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension in combination with hydrochlorothiazide (n=23), ramipril (n=21), or irbesartan (n=23). In the diuretic combination study, the addition of 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide to 150 mg of aliskiren daily for 3 weeks significantly lowered daytime pressure, compared with aliskiren monotherapy (systolic/diastolic mean change from baseline [SEM]: daytime: -18.4 [2.1]/ -10.6 [1.7] versus -10.4 [1.8]/-5.8 [1.4]; nighttime: -15.6 [2.7]/-8.1 [1.8] versus -8.8 [2.9]/-5.0 [2.2]).

Aliskiren (150 mg) alone significantly inhibited plasma renin activity by 65% (P<0.0001). Ramipril and irbesartan monotherapy caused 90% and 175% increases in plasma renin activity, respectively. By contrast, when aliskiren was coadministered with hydrochlorothiazide, ramipril, or irbesartan, plasma renin activity did not increase but remained similar to baseline levels or was decreased (combination therapy versus untreated; median [interquartile range]; aliskiren and hydrochlorothiazide: 0.4 [0.2 to 1.1] versus 0.7 [0.5 to 1.3]; ramipril and aliskiren: 0.5 [0.3 to 0.9] versus 0.6 [0.5 to 0.8]; irbesartan and aliskiren: 0.4 [0.2 to 0.9] versus 0.6 [0.4 to 0.9]).

Recent studies suggested that statins have additional beneficial effects on the vascular wall independent of their cholesterol-lowering effects. We investigated whether atorvastatin influences angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) production in differentiating human macrophages. Human peripheral blood monocytes (PBM) were isolated from fresh buffy coats. The cells were allowed to differentiate for 0-8 days in macrophage serum-free medium with 5 ng/ml granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Atorvastatin (0.005-0.5 microM), mevalonate (200-400 microM), geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (1.25-2.5 microM), and/or farnesylpyrophosphate (FPP; 1.25-2.5 microM) was added on the second day of differentiation and then every other day. After incubation time, the ACE amount in intact macrophages was measured. ACE amount in PBM was low. A marked time-dependent ACE induction was noticed during differentiation of monocytes to macrophages. Atorvastatin treatment inhibited ACE induction during differentiation. In the presence of mevalonate, atorvastatin failed to downregulate ACE production. Cotreatment of the cells with atorvastatin and FPP reversed the suppressive effect of atorvastatin on ACE. In conclusion, atorvastatin inhibited ACE upregulation, normally occurring in differentiating human macrophages. This effect was mediated via the mevalonate pathway, and inhibition of FPP was probably involved. The finding that atorvastatin inhibited ACE upregulation may represent a novel pleiotropic action and an additional beneficial effect of statins in treatment of cardiovascular disease.",

Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitors are effective therapy in men with ED owing to hypertension who are taking antihypertensive medicines including those on multiple antihypertensive medicines. The addition of PDE5 inhibitors to usual common antihypertensive medicines (diuretics, beta blockers, calcium blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers) results in either no or small additive reductions in blood pressure (BP) and no increase in serious clinical adverse events. There are however precautions regarding the use of PDE5 inhibitors in patients taking alpha blockers for either hypertension or benign prostatic hypertrophy, as some patients may develop orthostatic hypotension. Organic nitrates remain an absolute contraindication for PDE5 inhibitors because synergistic and symptomatic reductions in BP may occur in some patients with this drug combination.",

The effectiveness of this policy is unknown. The study cohort consisted of 43,200 hemodialysis patients in the US Gambro Healthcare System from 2002 to 2005. Of these, 729 patients who sustained an in-center cardiac arrest were identified. Baseline characteristics at the time of the event were compared between patients who underwent hemodialysis in clinics with and without an AED on site.

For this reason, rats were treated daily for 8 weeks with and without enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, or losartan, an angiotensin receptor antagonist, 3 days after inducing diabetes with an injection of streptozocin. Treatment of diabetic animals with both enalapril and losartan attenuated alterations in cardiac function and the left ventricular redox potential without any changes in the increased plasma glucose or reduced plasma insulin levels. The SL Na+-K+ ATPase, Ca2+ pump, Na+-dependent Ca2+-uptake, Ca2+-channel density, and low-affinity Ca2+-binding activities were depressed whereas Ca2+ ecto-ATPase activity was increased in the diabetic heart. Furthermore, the SR Ca2+-release and Ca2+-pump activities in the diabetic hearts were decreased without any changes in the Mg2+-ATPase activity. These alterations in SL and SR membranes in diabetic animals were partly prevented by treatments with enalapril and losartan. The results suggest that the activation of the renin-angiotensin system plays an important role in diabetes-induced changes in SL and SR membranes as well as cardiac function.", 
    "567": "The appropriate and timely evaluation and treatment of patients with severely elevated blood pressure is essential to avoid serious adverse outcomes. Most importantly, the distinction between a hypertensive emergency (crisis) and urgency needs to be made. A sudden elevation in systolic (SBP) and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) that is associated with acute end organ damage (cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, or renal) is defined as a hypertensive crisis or emergency. In contrast, acute elevation in SBP and/or DBP not associated with evidence of end organ damage is defined as hypertensive urgency. In patients with a hypertensive emergency, blood pressure control should be attained as expeditiously as possible with parenteral medications to prevent ongoing and potentially permanent end organ damage. In contrast, with hypertensive urgency, blood pressure control can be achieved with the use of oral medications within 24-48 hours. This paper reviews the management of hypertensive emergencies.", 
    "568": "Microalbuminuria has been shown to be a strong predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in diabetic and hypertensive patients, but also in the general population. Moreover, several reports suggest that reduction of urinary albumin excretion (UAE) is associated with improvement of cardiovascular prognosis. Reduction of UAE can be achieved by lowering arterial blood pressure, but blockers of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) with their specific renal actions have demonstrated to be able to reduce UAE more than might be expected from reduction of blood pressure alone. Consequently, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers may also provide superior cardiovascular protection, especially in subjects with higher levels of albuminuria, but evidence is still scarce. The ability of both angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers to reduce UAE and provide cardiovascular protection suggests that the RAS may play a central role. New developments in this area include the use of aldosterone antagonists in albuminuric/proteinuric subjects, and the development of oral renin inhibitors. Combinations of the aforementioned drugs may have the ability to fully block the RAS, potentially avoiding all detrimental effects of this hormonal cascade. However, combination therapy is expected to also increase the incidence of side effects, such as hyperkalaemia and acute renal insufficiency. The current knowledge of microalbuminuria represents the proverbial tip of the iceberg, and future studies should focus on the underlying pathophysiological mechanism of urinary albumin excretion in relation to cardiovascular protection. Only then can a better understanding of the problem be achieved and the optimal pharmacological approach be ascertained.", 
    "569": "Activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), with ensuing aldosterone excess, detrimentally affects outcome in patients with hypertension and heart failure (HF). RAS blockade with angiotensin (Ang) 1-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or Ang II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) is beneficial in such conditions. However, aldosterone secretion can persist despite these treatments. Hence, mechanisms besides Ang II acquire the role of aldosterone secretagogue. The RALES and EPHESUS studies have shown that this aldosterone \"escape\" or \"breakthrough\" is an important factor, because it is a determinant of outcome in HF patients. Endothelin (ET)-1, which stimulates aldosterone secretion via both A (ETA) and B (ETB) receptor subtypes, and which is increased in HF, is a candidate for the \"aldosterone breakthrough.\" Moreover, the novel ET peptide ET-1(1-31) is involved in adrenocortical growth. Therefore, findings suggesting a role for the ET-1 system as an aldosterone secretagogue, along with the potential usefulness of endothelin antagonists for the prevention of \"aldosterone breakthrough,\" are discussed.", 
    "570": "Excess body weight, high blood pressure, and insulin resistance together have been denominated the metabolic syndrome. In this review, we analyze the potential role of angiotensin II (Ang II) and reactive oxygen species in mediating inflammation in the metabolic syndrome. Ang II induces pro-inflammatory genes and other pro-inflammatory substances and increases oxidative stress that could damage endothelium, myocardium, and renal tissue. Activation of nuclear factor-kappaB and NAD(P)H oxidase are fundamental steps in these pro-inflammatory mechanisms in which intramitochondrial oxidative stress could play a critical role. This sequence of events might explain why reduction in Ang II synthesis by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and Ang II type 1 (AT1) receptor blockers (ARBs) have a protective effect against cardiovascular disease.", 
    "571": "Heart failure continues to be a significant problem faced by today's health care professional. Heart failure remains one of the principal causes of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The prevalence of heart failure continues to increase, largely due to an aging population and to modern technologic innovations that have led to prolonged survival of the cardiac patient. Hypertension increases the risk for heart failure in all age groups. In those individuals aged 40 years or older whose blood pressure is > 140/90 mm Hg, the lifetime risk for developing heart failure may be twice as high as that of their aged-matched counterparts. Therefore, it is imperative that the clinician be aware of the current diagnostic and therapeutic advancements for the early detection and aggressive treatment of hypertension and heart failure, to prevent patients from developing symptoms of heart failure and to decrease the need for hospitalizations once the diagnosis is confirmed.", 
    "572": "Sirolimus is a novel immunosuppressant with potent antiproliferative actions through its ability to inhibit the raptor-containing mammalian target of rapamycin protein kinase. Sirolimus represents a major therapeutic advance in the prevention of acute renal allograft rejection and chronic allograft nephropathy. Its role in the therapy of glomerulonephritis, autoimmunity, cystic renal diseases and renal cancer is under investigation. Because sirolimus does not share the vasomotor renal adverse effects exhibited by calcineurin inhibitors, it has been designated a 'non-nephrotoxic drug'. However, clinical reports suggest that, under some circumstances, sirolimus is associated with proteinuria and acute renal dysfunction. A common risk factor appears to be presence of pre-existing chronic renal damage. The mechanisms of sirolimus-associated proteinuria are multifactorial and may be due to an increase in glomerular capillary pressure following calcineurin inhibitor withdrawal. It has also been suggested that sirolimus directly causes increased glomerular permeability/injury, but evidence for this mechanism is currently inconclusive. The acute renal dysfunction associated with sirolimus (such as in delayed graft function) may be due to suppression of compensatory renal cell proliferation and survival/repair processes. Although these adverse effects occur in some patients, their occurrence could be minimised by knowledge of the molecular effects of sirolimus on the kidney, the use of sirolimus in appropriate patient populations, close monitoring of proteinuria and renal function, use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers if proteinuria occurs and withdrawal if needed. Further long-term analysis of renal allograft studies using sirolimus as de novo immunosuppression along with clinical and laboratory studies will refine these issues in the future.",

All patients had been tried on antireflux medication (proton pump inhibitors) and had a negative chest x-ray before presentation. All were nonsmokers without a history of asthma. Patients on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were excluded from the study. All patients completed a pretreatment, validated cough-specific quality-of-life (QOL) survey. Patients were randomized by chart numbers to either 10 mg amitriptyline at bedtime or 10 to 100 mg/5 mL, 10 mL codeine/guaifenesin every 6 hours standing dose while awake. Both groups were instructed to complete 10 days of therapy and then asked to subjectively rate the reduction in the frequency and severity of their cough by 100%, 75%, 50%, 25%, or 0% as well as completing the posttreatment cough QOL questionnaire. Those patients experiencing a 75% to 100% reduction were recorded as having a complete response, 25% to 50% a partial response, and 0% as having no response. Final results and the cough QOL survey were recorded and used for statistical analysis.",

The data were analyzed using a logistic regression model, and amitriptyline was found to be a highly significant predictor of a greater than 50% response when compared with codeine/guaifenesin (P = .0007). The same data were analyzed using a proportional odds model and similar results were noted.", 
    "576": "Chronic cough can have a profound impact on the psychosocial function of patients. The most common causes of a persisting cough in the absence of infection or chronic smoking are laryngopharyngeal reflux, asthma, particularly the cough variant, allergy, rhinosinusitis, bronchitis, and medications, in particular angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Currently, there are few effective treatments for cough with an acceptable therapeutic ratio and more selective drugs with a more favorable side effect profile are needed. This is this first prospective, randomized, controlled study comparing the effectiveness of amitriptyline versus codeine/guaifenesin for select cases of chronic cough resulting from suspected postviral vagal neuropathy.",

With the use of standard quality indicator definitions, treatment of ideal candidates with aspirin and beta-blockers within 24 hours after presentation, beta-blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors at discharge was assessed. Multivariable models were constructed to calculate adjusted 1-year mortality. The hospitalized Medicare population with AMI changed substantially during 1992-2001, with increasing age, more comorbidity, and fewer meeting ideal treatment criteria. Although treatment rates increased significantly for all medications, aspirin, beta-blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were not provided at discharge to 12.6%, 19.7%, and 25.2% of ideal candidates, respectively, in 2000-2001. Crude 1-year mortality increased (27.6%, 28.3%, 30.6%, and 31.0%; P=0.003 for trend, but adjusted mortality declined (compared with 1992-1993, relative risk in 1995=0.94 [95% CI, 0.88 to 1.01]; relative risk in 1998-1999=0.91 [95% CI, 0.85 to 0.98]; relative risk in 2000-2001=0.87 [95% CI, 0.81 to 0.94]).",

Nevertheless, fewer were ideal for guideline-based therapy, and absolute mortality remains high, suggesting the need for treatment strategies applicable to a broader range of older patients.", 
    "580": "The safety and efficacy of the concomitant use of intravenous diuretics and positive inotropes with nesiritide have not been well studied. There is also a paucity of data examining whether the type of medical therapy before treatment with nesiritide has an effect on outcomes. Data from 167 patients with heart failure and reduced left ventricular ejection fractions (34 +/- 17%) treated with nesiritide were analyzed retrospectively. Baseline oral medications were continued, diuretic regimens were modified, and nitrates were discontinued. Forty-three patients (26%) received intravenous furosemide with nesiritide. The glomerular filtration rate before and after nesiritide infusion was not different in patients treated with versus without furosemide (0.7 +/- 8.8 vs 0.7 +/- 11.0 ml/min/1.73 m(2), p = 0.71). Change in urine output from before to during nesiritide infusion was greater with concomitant furosemide (41 +/- 57 vs 10 +/- 58 m/hour, p = 0.006). There was no significant difference in survival with furosemide (90% vs 89% at 30 days, 62% vs 57% at 12 months, p = 0.63). Thirty-nine patients (23%) received inotrope support with nesiritide. The glomerular filtration rate tended to improve when inotropes were used with nesiritide (3.3 +/- 13.1 vs -0.1 +/- 9.4, ml/min/1.73 m(2), p = 0.17). No significant changes in serum creatinine or urine output were observed with inotrope use. Survival was not worsened in those receiving inotropes (p = 0.51). Also, there were no significant differences in serum creatinine, glomerular filtration rate, or urine output in patients who continued to receive angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, beta blockers, or digoxin therapy during nesiritide infusion. In conclusion, there were no observed adverse affects of baseline medical therapy, intravenous diuretics, or intravenous inotropes on renal functions or mortality when used in conjunction with nesiritide in the treatment of decompensated chronic heart failure.", 
    "581": "A specific high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometric (LC-MS/MS) assay was developed for the determination of captopryl in plasma. The retention time was 1.45 and 1.37 min for captopril and enalapril, respectively. The overall mean recovery, using SPE extraction with OASIS HLB cartridges, was found to be 107.2+/-9.5 and 100.04+/-2%, respectively. Calibration curves were linear in the concentration range of 10.00-2000.00 ng/ml, and the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was 10.00 ng/ml. The LLOQ was sensitive enough for detecting terminal phase concentrations of the drug. Inter-batch precision of the method ranged from 0.88 to 1.95%. Intra-batch accuracy ranged from 97.15 to 105.77%, while intra-batch precision ranged from 2.49 to 5.66% at concentrations of 30.00, 760.00 and 1500.00 ng/ml.

    "582": "Germinal angiotensin I-converting enzyme (gACE) was purified to homogeneity from porcine seminal plasma. The molecular weight of the purified enzyme was calculated to be 182,000 on non-denaturing PAGE and 94,000 and 93,000 on SDS-PAGE in the absence and presence of beta-ME, respectively. These findings suggest that the enzyme is composed of two identical subunits in seminal plasma. The K(m), V(max), K(cat) and K(cat)/K(m) values of gACE at optimal pH (pH 7.2) were 680 microM, 1.0 micromol/mg/min, 33.1 s(-1) and 4.87 x 10(4) s(-1) M(-1) for Z-Val-Lys-Met-MCA, respectively. gACE was potently inhibited by EDTA, 1,10-phenanthroline, captopril and lisinopril, and it promptly released the dipeptides His-Leu and Phe-Arg from angiotensin I and bradykinin. Met- and Leu-enkephalins, neuromedine B and beta-neo-endorphin were also good natural substrates for gACE. We determined the structure of gACE cDNA from the porcine testis, and deduced the amino acid sequence of gACE. The cDNA is composed of 2508 bp of nucleotides in length and encodes 745 amino acids in the coding region. The overall homology of amino acid sequences between porcine, human, sheep and rat gACEs is 72.6 to 84.7%.

However, less information is available on patients whose left ventricular ejection fraction normalizes after an episode of systolic dysfunction secondary to acute myocarditis. We followed 35 patients who were diagnosed at our center between 1987 and 1995 with acute myocarditis and an ejection fraction<45%. All were taking ACE inhibitors. After 34 (23) months of follow-up, the left ventricular ejection fraction was >50% in all 35 patients. Treatment with ACE inhibitors was discontinued in 15 of the 35 patients, while the other 20 continued ACE inhibitor therapy. After 3 years of follow-up, no death had occurred, but the incidence of new episodes of heart failure with a left ventricular ejection fraction<45% was higher in patients who stopped taking ACE inhibitors (33% vs 5%, P=.064), and their ejection fraction was lower (47 [12%] vs 57 [11%], P=.002). These results suggest that ACE inhibitors should be continued over the long term in these patients.",

Current clinical practice guidelines emphasize the importance of diagnosing and treating left ventricular dysfunction in patients without symptoms of heart disease. It is essential that currently available scientific findings are taken into account when treating all patients seen with this condition, from dietary advice to use of the most sophisticated devices. We do not know the precise treatment responses of patient belonging to subgroups that were underrepresented in large clinical trials. The present article, written after the recent publication of European and American clinical practice guidelines, provides a summary of recommended medical treatment for patients with heart failure due to systolic dysfunction.", 
    "585": "The prognosis of heart failure in elderly patients is poor. The knowledge of the particular aspects of this pathology could certainly increase the prevention and the therapeutic approach of this disease. The presence of many precipitating factors and comorbidities is typical of this pathology. The clinical diagnosis is particularly difficult, especially because the signs and symptoms are similar to those of frequent disorders in elderly patients. Moreover, cognition and sensory impairments and the spontaneous reduction of the physical activity, masking symptoms, may also disturb the diagnosis. Diastolic heart failure, frequent in old patients, contributes sometimes to perturb the diagnosis. The treatment of heart failure in elderly people is based in first line on the control of the precipitating factors. The pharmacotherapy is not fundamentally different from the younger patient and must follow the recommendations of the literature (Evidence Based Medicine). The underutilization of proven therapy must indeed be avoided. However, the careful beginning, at very low doses, and a careful titration to obtain the recommended doses, is essential. Moreover, the susceptibility to side effects and the frequent contra-indications in the elderly require meticulous precautions in the prescription of the drugs. Diuretics remain the cornerstone to promptly control the pulmonary congestion and the edema. The angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, the antagonists of the angiotensin-receptors and the beta-blockers must be prescribed as in the younger patients. Digoxin plays also a role in several precise indications. Coronary angioplasty, heart surgery and technique of resynchronization have indications in certain cases. Multidisciplinary approach and vigilant follow-up are essential to improve the prognostic of heart failure in elderly patients.",

    "590": "IgA nephropathy is currently the most frequently occurring type of primary glomerulonephritis. Studies aimed at determining the factors of favorable and unfavorable prognosis in the progression of the disease are conducted. Apart from the above renal disease progression factors, it seems that renal functional reserve (RFR), indirectly indicating the functional status of intrarenal vessels can be a marker assisting in determining prognosis and effectiveness of applied treatment. Decrease in RFR is one of the first symptoms of renal damage, since it precedes decrease in GFR assessed in resting condition. The aim of our study was to assess selected functional (RFR), metabolic, and genetic parameters of renal disease progression in patients with IgA nephropathy, as well as to determine their effect on clinical progression of the disease. Material and methods. The study comprised 30 patients with renal biopsy proven IgA nephropathy, aged 35,2 +/- 8,9, 12 women and 18 men, who had conducted a 12-month period of observation and treatment. The patients' RFR was measured and the following parameters in blood pressure samples were established: creatinine, BUN, uric acid, total cholesterol (TCH), HDL and LDL and TG, homocysteine, endothelium functional indicators: vWF:Ag, TPA:Ag, PAI-1, polymorphism of the human angiotensin converting enzyme gene and endothelial nitric oxide synthase gene. In 24-hour urine collection N-acetylglucosaminidase excretion and daily protein loss were measured. Results. During treatment, changes in some biochemical indicators were observed (uric acid, TCH, LDL, DUB, NAG, erythrocyturia, homocysteine), while others remained stable. Statistically significant differences in concentrations of endothelial antigens: vWF:Ag and PAI-1 were found. Conclusions. Based on the analysis of the results it was concluded that functional status of intrarenal vessels is related to functional status of endothelium and renal tubulae, and also that it probably affects the response to treatment. Decrease of proteinuria during treatment is, among others, related to decrease of metabolic disorders, while the initial results of analysis of polymorphism of the human angiotensin converting enzyme gene and endothelial nitric oxide synthase gene suggest that it may affect the decrease of proteinuria and concentration of homocysteine in the blood.",

To test for efficacy, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were immunized with 400 microg AngQb or VLP alone. Group mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) was reduced by up to 21 mmHg (159 +/- 2 versus 180 +/- 5 mmHg, P < 0.001), and total angiotensin II levels (antibody-bound and free) were increased ninefold (85 +/- 20 versus 9 +/- 1 pmol/l, P = 0.002) compared with VLP controls. SHR treated with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor ramipril (1 mg/kg per day by mouth) reached an SBP of 155 +/- 2 mmHg.

Vasopeptidase inhibition may still find a role despite the small incremental value of this approach and the obvious issue of kinin-mediated adverse effects still to be fully addressed. Blockade of the RAAS upstream using renin inhibitors as well as the greater selectivity of aldosterone blockade using selective aldosterone blockers such as eplerenone are also novel approaches. Not yet in clinical use but certainly an attractive therapeutic target is angiotensin II growth factor receptor transactivation, with selective inhibitors having been developed for various specific kinase pathways. Finally, ACE2 augmentation, antisense gene strategies, and vaccination against the renin-angiotensin system should still be considered experimental, but have significant appeal as additional approaches to the blockade of this system.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of genetic influences of angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACE) gene polymorphisms with response to vitamin D therapy among patients on hemodialysis (HD). Eighty-two patients (female/male, 34/48; mean age, 47.5+/-15.3 y; HD duration time, 76.6+/-33.2 mo) with endstage renal disease who were on maintenance HD were included in the study. Five-year retrospective demographic, clinical, laboratory, and treatment data (5-y cumulative doses of phosphate-binding drugs and oral and intravenous cumulative doses of active vitamin D) were retrieved from patients' hospital records. ACE gene polymorphisms of patients were documented and were used to group patients as follows: The insertion/deletion polymorphism group (I/D) consisted of (1) group non-DD (n=43), who had the DI or II allele, and (2) group DD (n=39), who had the DD allele. Patients with the DD allele (group DD) of ACE gene polymorphism had (1) significantly elevated mean 5-y intact parathyroid hormone levels when compared with the non-DD group (P=.009), and (2) significantly elevated oral and intravenous 5-y cumulative doses of vitamin D. Oral and intravenous 5-y cumulative doses of vitamin D used in group DD patients were significantly higher than those in group I patients (P=.038 and P=.037, respectively). Knowledge of genetic differences among patients on HD may be useful to the clinician in planning treatment strategy. ACE gene polymorphism may have an effect on hyperparathyroidism, as is seen in patients on HD. Patients from this group who have resistant hyperparathyroidism may be candidates for ACE inhibitor therapy.",

A major area of improvement is the correction of the extracellular volume expansion. This goal can be reached by means of dietary salt restriction (100 mEq/d of NaCl). If this intervention fails, hypertension can be treated by thiazide diuretics in patients with mild CKD, whereas loop diuretics at adequate doses are indicated in patients with more advanced CKD. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers are more effective than other drugs in slowing progression of proteinuric diabetic and nondiabetic CKD. However, the control rates of blood pressure are usually inadequate with antihypertensive therapy including only these drugs; therefore, addition of other classes of antihypertensive drugs is often required.", 
    "622": "Diabetes and hypertension frequently coexist, and their combination provides additive increases in the risk of life-threatening cardiovascular events. Recent guidelines agree (JN-VII) on the need for early, aggressive reduction of blood pressure, with a goal of < 130/80 mmHg, in patients with diabetes. The mechanism responsible for the increased sensitivity of diabetics to hypertension is not known, but may involve attenuated nocturnal decrease (non-dipping) of blood pressure. Treatment of hypertension in type 2 diabetes provides dramatic cardiovascular benefit. Aggressive blood pressure control may be the most important factor in preventing adverse outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes. Target diastolic blood pressures of less than 80 mm Hg and systolic targets less than 135 mm Hg appear optimal. All classes of antihypertensive agents are effective in reducing blood pressure in patients with diabetes, and all show evidence of a concomitant reduction in cardiovascular risk. Although there is evidence that agents that interrupt the renin-angiotensin system system may be superior in both the nephroprotection and cardioprotection, however the data are not totally conclusive. However, most diabetics and especially diabetic patients with nephropathy will require combination therapy (\"antihypertensive cocktail\") to reach goal blood pressure. Hypertensive patients have a significantly increased risk for the development of type 2 diabetes, and antihypertensive drugs can also significantly influence the risk for that. While diuretics and ss-blockers have a prodiabetic effect, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers may prevent diabetes more effectively than the metabolically neutral calcium channel blockers.",

Our search of the literature did not reveal any randomized clinical trials or meta-analyses. The available information is derived from opinion, reviews, retrospective series, and limited observational series. It appears that chronic renal disease in pregnancy is uncommon, occurring in 0.03-0.12% of all pregnancies from two U.S. population-based and registry studies. Maternal complications associated with chronic renal disease include preeclampsia, worsening renal function, preterm delivery, anemia, chronic hypertension, and cesarean delivery. The live birth rate in women with chronic renal disease ranges between 64% and 98% depending on the severity of renal insufficiency and presence of hypertension. Significant proteinuria may be an indicator of underlying renal insufficiency. Management of pregnant women with underlying renal disease should ideally entail a multidisciplinary approach at a tertiary center and include a maternal-fetal medicine specialist and a nephrologist. Such women should receive counseling regarding the pregnancy outcomes in association with maternal chronic renal disease and the effect of pregnancy on renal function, especially within the ensuing 5 years postpartum. These women will require frequent visits and monitoring of renal function during pregnancy. Women whose renal disease is further complicated by hypertension should be counseled regarding the increased risk of adverse outcome and need for blood pressure control. Some antihypertensives, especially angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers, should be avoided during pregnancy, if possible, because of the potential for both teratogenic (hypocalvaria) and fetal effects (renal failure, oliguria, and demise).",

    "640": "L-Homophenylalanine (l-HPA) is a chiral unnatural amino acid used in the synthesis of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and many pharmaceuticals. To develop a bioconversion process with dynamic resolution of N-acylamino acids for the l-HPA production, N-acylamino acid racemase (NAAAR) and l-aminoacylase (LAA) genes were cloned from Deinococcus radiodurans BCRC12827 and expressed in Escherichia coli XLIBlue. The recombinant enzymes were purified by nickel-chelate chromatography, and their biochemical properties were determined. The NAAAR had high racemization activity toward chiral N-acetyl-homophenylalanine (NAc-HPA). The LAA exhibited strict l-enantioselection to hydrolyze the NAc-l-HPA. A stirred glass vessel containing transformed E. coli cells expressing D. radiodurans NAAAR and LAA was used for the conversion of NAc-d-HPA to l-HPA. Unbalance activities of LAA and NAAAR were found in E. coli cell coexpressing laa and naaar genes, which resulted in the accumulation of an intermediate, NAc-l-HPA, in the early stage of conversion and a low productivity of 0.83 mmol l-HPA/L h. The results indicated that low activity of LAA present in the biomass is the rate-limiting factor in l-HPA production. In the case of two whole cells with separately expressed enzyme, the enzymatic activities of LAA and NAAAR could be balanced by changing the loading of individual cells. When the activities of two enzymes were fixed at 3600 U/L, 99.9% yield of l-HPA could be reached in 1 h, with a productivity of 10 mmol l-HPA/L h. The cells can be reused at least six cycles at a conversion yield of more than 96%. This is the first NAAAR/LAA process using NAc-HPA as substrate and recombinant whole cells containing Deinococcus enzymes as catalysts for the production of l-HPA to be reported.",

We followed up these patients until November 2003. During the follow-up period, 30 patients died. About half of all patients (48%) had PAC values above the normal range. We assigned the 128 patients to a lower (<22.9) or higher (> or = 22.9) PAC group according to the median baseline PAC. The survival rate as calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method was 90.6% in the higher PAC group and 62.5% in the lower PAC group (p=0.003). In multivariate analysis, serum potassium and plasma renin activity were independent determinants of PAC. Cox proportional hazards analysis, with adjustment for other variables including diabetes, showed that lower PAC was independently predictive of death. The adjusted hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) of the lower PAC group was 2.905 (1.187-7.112, p=0.020). The significance of PAC became marginal by adjustment with albumin or potassium. These results indicate that higher PAC is common, but not associated with an increase in total and cardiovascular deaths among hypertensive patients undergoing chronic HD. The association between lower PAC and poor survival may be driven by volume retention and/or lower potassium.",

A functional eNOS transfers electrons from NADPH to its heme center, where L-arginine is oxidized to L-citrulline and NO. Common conditions predisposing to atherosclerosis, such as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus and smoking, are associated with enhanced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reduced amounts of bioactive NO in the vessel wall. NADPH oxidases represent major sources of ROS in cardiovascular pathophysiology. NADPH oxidase-derived superoxide avidly interacts with eNOS-derived NO to form peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)), which oxidizes the essential NOS cofactor (6R-)5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4)). As a consequence, oxygen reduction uncouples from NO synthesis, thereby rendering NOS to a superoxide-producing pro-atherosclerotic enzyme. Supplementation with BH(4) corrects eNOS dysfunction in several animal models and in patients. Administration of high local doses of the antioxidant L-ascorbic acid (vitamin C) improves endothelial function, whereas large-scale clinical trials do not support a strong role for oral vitamin C and/or E in reducing cardiovascular disease. Statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and AT1 receptor blockers have the potential of reducing vascular oxidative stress.

Perindopril impairs RAS activity, most in patients with ACE gene II genotype. The treatment with perindopril is only partially effective in alleviating the procoagulant state, by reducing fibrinogen level in II homozygotes due to its more potent inhibitory action on the RAS in this group. The treatment makes fibrinolysis better mainly to high t-PA levels, independently of ACE gene I/D polymorphism. 3. Left ventricular hypertrophy not differentiates the response on treatment in relation to haemostasis parameters and RAS, however there was a slight decrease in ACE activity in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy. 4.

Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and _ blockers were shown to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with CHF. Yet, their effectiveness is limited. A significant number of patients with heart failure manifest myocardial conduction abnormalities. Conduction abnormalities, especially in the form of left bundle branch block (LBBB) may be associated with abnormal mechanical function. Several studies demonstrated that these patients may gain benefit from biventricular (BiV) pacing in terms of improvement in exercise tolerance, heart failure morbidity and even decreased mortality. BiV pacing was also associated with improvement in ejection fraction, reduction in the extent of mitral regurgitation and a decrease in cardiac size (reverse remodeling). However, a significant number of patients do not gain benefit from biventricular pacing despite having conduction abnormalities. The underlying reason is that the electrical activity may not closely reflect mechanical activity. Several imaging modalities and techniques have been proposed to improve the selection of patients who may benefit from biventricular pacemakers. Of those, echo-Doppler, and especially, Tissue Doppler Imaging has been demonstrated as important tools for evaluating patients for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) and following their response. The advantages of echo include accessibility, portability, its cost and a high temporal resolution. Yet, it is limited by its acoustic windows and scanning angles. MRI is a useful tool for evaluating patients for CRT by providing 3-D image of myocardial function. However, it is limited for follow-up after implantation due to its cost and a potential damage to the patients or pacemakers. Dyssnchrony imaging is a rapidly evolving field.

Reciprocal relationships between endothelial dysfunction and insulin resistance may contribute to hypertension by causing imbalanced regulation of endothelial-derived vasodilators (e.g., nitric oxide) and vasoconstrictors (e.g., endothelin-1 [ET-1]). Treatment of SHRs with rosiglitazone (insulin sensitizer) and/or enalapril (ACE inhibitor) may simultaneously improve hypertension, insulin resistance, and endothelial dysfunction by rebalancing insulin-stimulated production of vasoactive mediators. When compared with WKY control rats, 12-week-old vehicle-treated SHRs were hypertensive, overweight, and insulin resistant, with elevated fasting levels of insulin and ET-1 and reduced serum adiponectin levels. In mesenteric vascular beds (MVBs) isolated from vehicle-treated SHRs and preconstricted with norepinephrine (NE) ex vivo, vasodilator responses to insulin were significantly impaired, whereas the ability of insulin to oppose vasoconstrictor actions of NE was absent (versus WKY controls). Three-week treatment of SHRs with rosiglitazone and/or enalapril significantly reduced blood pressure, insulin resistance, fasting insulin, and ET-1 levels and increased adiponectin levels to values comparable with those observed in vehicle-treated WKY controls. By restoring phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent effects, rosiglitazone and/or enalapril therapy of SHRs also significantly improved vasodilator responses to insulin in MVB preconstricted with NE ex vivo. Taken together, our data provide strong support for the existence of reciprocal relationships between endothelial dysfunction and insulin resistance that may be relevant for developing novel therapeutic strategies for the metabolic syndrome.", 
    "668": "There is clear evidence that pharmacologic blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) reduces proteinuria and slows the progression of renal disease in diabetic and nondiabetic nephropathies, a beneficial effect that is not related to BP control. Some patients exhibit a significant beneficial response, whereas others do not. The absence of response may be explained by the incomplete blockade of the RAS obtained with ACEI. In the search of new alternatives that could improve the antiproteinuric and nephroprotective effects of RAS blockers, the association of ACEI and ARB might prove useful. ARB produces a complete blockade of the RAS. Several studies have shown a more marked antiproteinuric effect of the dual blockade of the RAS versus ACEI or ARB alone. A recent study also demonstrated that this more marked antiproteinuric effect is associated with less progression of renal disease in primary nondiabetic nephropathies despite a similar effect on BP. Until now, there has not been any reference to a beneficial effect on progression of the dual blockade in type 2 diabetic nephropathy, which is the most frequent cause of ESRD. A multicenter, prospective, open, active-controlled, and parallel-group trial was designed to compare the effects of an ACE inhibitor versus an ARB or its combination on renal disease progression, proteinuria, and cardiovascular events in type 2 diabetic nephropathy.",

In contrast, perindopril treatment led to a substantial diminution in TGF-beta1 mRNA (mean 83% reduction, P < 0.05). Phosphorylated Smad2 immunolabeling and betaig-H3 mRNA were similarly reduced with ACE inhibition (P < 0.05) but unchanged in the placebo group.

In this work we show pharmacological evidence for the existence of a different Ang-(1-7) receptor subtype mediating the vasodilator effect of Ang-(1-7) in the aorta from Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Ang-(1-7) induced an endothelium-dependent vasodilator effect in aortic rings from SD rats which was inhibited by removal of the endothelium and by L-NAME (100 microM) but not by indomethacin (10 microM). The Ang-(1-7) receptor antagonist D-Pro7-Ang-(1-7) (0.1 microM) abolished the vasodilator effect of the peptide. However, the other specific Ang-(1-7) receptor antagonist, A-779 in concentrations up to 10 microM, did not affect vasodilation induced by Ang-(1-7). The Ang II AT1 and AT2 receptors antagonists CV11974 (0.01 microM) and PD123319 (1 microM), respectively, the bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist HOE 140 (1 microM) and the inhibitor of ACE captopril (10 microM) did not change the effect of Ang-(1-7). Our results show that in the aorta of SD rats, the vasodilator effect of Ang-(1-7) is dependent on endothelium-derived nitric oxide. This effect is mediated by the activation of Ang-(1-7) receptors sensitive to D-Pro7-Ang-(1-7), but not to A-779, which suggests the existence of a different Ang-(1-7) receptor subtype.",

According to Clinical guidelines of IgA nephropathy 2nd version, Committee of IgA Nephropathy-the Special Study Group on Progressive Glomerular Disease, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare of Japan-, her prognosis belonged to a rather poor group. We planed to administer steroid treatment first, however considering the adverse effects of steroid therapy, such as hyperlipidemia and diabetes mellitus, we tried to decrease her body weight as much as possible, and then treated her with both angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and anti-platelet drug. After her body mass index (body weight) was approximately 30.1 % (30 kg) less than that on admission, a parallel reduction of urinary protein was observed, and the final level was approximately 0.18 g/day.

This retrospective case-matched study included 60 diabetic and 55 non-diabetic patients. Medical information about patients was retrieved from the hospital recordings. Diabetic patients were older, were more hypertensive and had more coronary artery disease history than nondiabetic patients. The frequency of use of acute reperfusion therapy modalities was not statistically different between the two groups. Diabetes was a significant determinant against the use of beta blockers (OR=0.26; 95% CI 0.06-0.95) but in favor of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (OR=3.3; 95% CI 1.17-9.36), whereas diabetes did not influence the use of other drugs. Diabetic patients had more complications than nondiabetic patients (40.0% and 16.3%, respectively, p=0.005). In-hospital mortality rate for diabetic patients was comparable to nondiabetic patients (16.7% and 10.9%, respectively, p=0.373). Pharmaceutical treatment regimens, particularly beta blockers, are underutilized after acute MI in diabetic patients. More frequent use of these regimens will improve the high complication and mortality rates in diabetic patients as well as in nondiabetic patients.",

The present in vivo study investigated the use of LDF to measure myocardial microperfusion in beating rat hearts. Ascending aortic flow and other hemodynamic parameters were simultaneously recorded. A needle probe with a holder was adhered to the epicardium of the left ventricular myocardium close to the left anterior descending coronary artery in an anaesthetized open-chest rat. Myocardial microperfusion was measured in response to bolus intravenous administration of both two representative vasodilators (captopril and nifedipine) and a vasoconstrictor (pituitrin). Myocardial microperfusion was found to be predominately diastolic, and in an opposing phase to the ascending aortic flow. Captopril (5 or 10 mg/kg) increased the initial myocardial microperfusion phase. Nifedipine at 75 microg/kg caused a sustained myocardial microperfusion elevation with a peak increase of 7.1+/-1.1%, but this was not observed using 150 microg/kg nifedipine. Both drugs caused an increase in the cardiac index. In contrast, myocardial microperfusion decreased (28.7+/-0.1% maximum decrease) in response to 1 IU/kg pituitrin. In conclusion, LDF provided a means of assessing myocardial microperfusion in beating rat hearts, and can be applied to evaluate the coronary microcirculation response to drugs.",

The composition of optimized formulation was Sefsol 218 (20% w/w), Tween 80 (18% w/w), Carbitol (18% w/w) and standard buffer solution pH 5 (44% w/w) as oil, surfactant, cosurfactant and aqueous phase, respectively, containing 5 mg of ramipril showing drug release (95%), droplet size (80.9 nm), polydispersity (0.271), viscosity (10.68 cP), and infinite dilution capability. In vitro drug release of the nanoemulsion formulations was highly significant (p<0.01) as compared to marketed capsule formulation and drug suspension. The relative bioavailability of ramipril nanoemulsion to that of conventional capsule form was found to be 229.62% whereas to that of drug suspension was 539.49%.

At each tree level the algorithm projects a data set via principle component analysis onto one dimension. The data set is sorted according to this one dimension and split at the median position. To avoid distortion of clusters at the median position, the algorithm identifies a potentially more suited split point left or right of the median. The procedure is recursively applied on the resulting subsets until the maximal distance between cluster members exceeds a user-defined threshold. The approach was validated in a retrospective screening study for angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. The resulting clusters were assessed for their purity and enrichment in actives belonging to this ligand class. Enrichment was observed in individual branches of the dendrogram. In further retrospective virtual screening studies employing the MDL Drug Data Report (MDDR), COBRA, and the SPECS catalog, NIPALSTREE was compared with the hierarchical k-means clustering approach.

Results showed that a single-component model could explain 52 and 50% of the Y variance (bitterness threshold) of bitter di- and tri-peptides, respectively. Using PLS regression coefficients, it was determined that hydrophobic amino acids at the carboxyl-terminus and bulky amino acid residues adjacent to the carboxyl terminal are the major determinants of the intensity of bitterness of di- and tri-peptides.

Each year hundreds of thousands of these survivors undergo remodeling of their left ventricle and often progress to clinical congestive heart failure. The extent of remodeling has been linked to the size of the infarct, whether or not the myocardium has been revascularized, and the control of loading conditions. The extent of infarction can be measured several ways, including the amount of enzyme released as well as infarct imaging with nuclear perfusion or magnetic resonance imaging. Methods to prevent adverse remodeling of the ventricle have included pharmacotherapy with beta-blockers, nitrates, and modulators of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Surgical intervention has proven useful for select patients with aneurysmal areas of remodeling. Researchers are now investigating several approaches to preventing and reversing cardiac remodeling.

    "715": "In heart failure, the Arg16Gly and Gln27Glu polymorphisms of the beta2-adrenoreceptor (beta2-AR) gene are associated with exercise-capacity, clinical outcomes and response to beta-AR blocker therapy. Whether beta2-AR gene variants mediate these effects in-part through an impact on cardiac structural remodeling and pump function independent of the effects of beta-blockers is uncertain. We evaluated whether the Arg16Gly and Gln27Glu variants of the beta2-AR gene predict left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and LV end diastolic diameter (LVEDD) in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC) before and 6 months after receiving standard medical therapy other than beta-AR blockers. In all, 394 patients with IDC and 393 age and gender-matched controls were genotyped for the beta2-AR gene variants using restriction-fragment length polymorphism-based techniques. LVEF and dimensions were determined in 132 patients (of whom 71 were newly diagnosed) both at baseline and after 6 months. Genotype of neither variant was associated with the presence of IDC. Moreover, beta2-AR genotype did not determine LVEF or LV dimensions prior to initiating therapy. After 6 months of therapy, LVEF increased by 7.1+/-1.0 absolute units (P<0.0001) and LVEDD decreased by 0.27+/-0.06 cm (P<0.02). Adjusting for baseline values as well as gender, age, and type of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy received, genotype was associated with neither final LVEF and LVEDD, nor change in LVEF and LVEDD. In conclusion, these data suggest that in heart failure, the functional Arg16Gly and Gln27Glu variants of the beta2-AR gene have no independent effect on adverse structural remodeling and pump function.",

Forty-five patients with heart failure, referred for CT, were prospectively studied. After initial assessment, low-dose milrinone was titrated based on clinical response. Hemodynamic status was then reevaluated. Thirty-nine patients were discharged on HMT. Patients needing a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) despite milrinone (group I) and those not requiring LVAD (group II) were compared. Six of the 45 patients were ineligible for CT; 16 of 39 required LVAD as a bridge to CT despite milrinone (group I); 23 were stable on milrinone and did not require LVAD (group II). Group I was younger than group II (mean age 38.4 +/- 14.5 years vs. 57.3 +/- 5.9 years, p < 0.001). Initial acute response to intravenous milrinone [e.g., fall in the PCWP (-10.7 +/- 9.5 vs. -2.7 +/- 10.4, p = 0.02), rise in pulmonary artery oxygen saturations (16.5 +/- 8.7 vs. 7.3 +/- 10.9, p = 0.05)] was significantly better in group II than in group I.

Perfusion of NMDA (10 and 50 microM) through the microdialysis probe significantly enhanced extracellular concentrations of 5-HT and its metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in the LPBN area. Local perfusion of the NMDA antagonist dizocilpine (MK801, 10 and 50 microM) did not change the basal 5-HT and 5-HIAA levels in the LPBN area. MK801 (10 microM) administered together with NMDA antagonized the stimulant effect of NMDA (10 microM). The intake of 0.3M NaCl and water induced by subcutaneous injections of the diuretic furosemide (FURO, 10 mg/kg) and the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (CAP, 5 mg/kg) produced significant increases in the 5-HT and 5-HIAA concentrations in the LPBN area. The increased levels of 5-HT and 5-HIAA caused by the combined treatment with FURO and CAP were attenuated by perfusion of MK801 (10 microM). These results indicate the participation of NMDA receptors in the control of 5-HT release in the LPBN area.",

Four groups of rats, all given angiotensin II (Ang II) for 2 weeks, were studied: 1) control, 2) enalapril, 3) tempol or 4) both tempol and enalapril. Ang II significantly increased systolic blood pressure (BP) when compared with the baseline (170+/-8 vs. 128+/-4 mm Hg, P<0.05). Neither enalapril nor tempol alone was able to attenuate the elevation in BP (165+/-7 and 164+/-6 mm Hg, respectively). In contrast, combined administration of tempol and enalapril prevented the increase in BP (137+/-5 mm Hg). Plasma 8-isoprostane increased in Ang II-infused rats when compared with control untreated rats (69+/-14 vs. 23+/-0.5 pg/ml, P<0.05). Tempol alone or tempol plus enalapril significantly attenuated the increase in plasma 8-isoprostane (29+/-6 and 34+/-7 pg/ml, respectively). In additional experiments, we used the bradykinin B(2) antagonist, icatibant to determine if increased B(2) receptor contributes to the anti-hypertensive effect of combined tempol and enalapril in Ang II-infused rats. Icatibant decreased the ability of this combination to lower arterial pressure. Additionally, a significant increase in B(1) receptor protein expression in renal cortex of Ang II-infused rats was observed compared to control suggesting that bradykinin receptor activation could account for the effect of enalapril to enhance the actions of tempol. These data support the hypothesis that combined reduction of superoxide along with enhanced endogenous kinins may facilitate blood pressure lowering in Ang II hypertension.",

At baseline, the 2 groups, neither one previously treated with antihypertensive drugs, were not significantly different with regard to sex, age, body mass index, 24-hour BP, and heart rate; LV mass index was similar between the groups, whereas LV diastolic indices were significantly lower in group 1. At the second evaluation, body mass index, 24-hour BP, and heart rate were unchanged in both groups; LV mass index was significantly decreased in group 1 and increased in group 2. LV diastolic parameters were significantly improved in group 1, whereas in group 2, diastolic function was significantly deteriorated.

    "738": "Blockade of advanced glycation end product (AGE) accumulation with alagebrium with concomitant angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition was tested for effects on renal function and on other postulated mediators of diabetic renal disease including the renin-angiotensin system, AGEs, mitochondrial and cytosolic oxidative stress, and intracellular signaling molecules. Sprague Dawley rats were rendered diabetic with streptozocin and followed consecutively for 32 wk with nondiabetic controls. Groups were treated with ramipril (1 mg/kg.d; wk 0-32); alagebrium (10 mg/kg.d; wk 16-32); or a combination of both. Although individual treatments had significant effects on albuminuria, no further improvements were seen with combination therapy. Changes in urinary vascular endothelial growth factor excretion mirrored those seen in albuminuria. Diabetes was associated with suppression of circulating angiotensin II in the context of increased circulating and renal levels of the AGE, carboxymethyllysine. All treatments attenuated circulating but not renal carboxymethyllysine levels. The renal gene expression of AGE receptor 1 and soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products were markedly reduced by diabetes and normalized with alagebrium. Diabetes induced renal mitochondrial oxidative stress, which was reduced with alagebrium. In the cytosol, both therapies were equally effective in reducing reactive oxygen species production. Increases in membranous protein kinase C activity in diabetes were attenuated by all treatments, whereas diabetes-associated increases in nuclear factor-kappaB p65 translocation remained unaltered by any therapy. It is evident that renin-angiotensin system blockade and AGE inhibition have specific effects. However, many of their downstream effects appear to be similar, suggesting that their renoprotective benefits may ultimately involve common pathways and key points of convergence, which could be important targets for new therapies in diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "739": "Non-stochastic and stochastic 2D bilinear indices have been generalized to codify chemical structure information for chiral drugs, making use of a trigonometric 3D-chirality correction factor. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of this novel approach in drug design we have modeled the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitory activity of perindoprilate's sigma-stereoisomers combinatorial library. Two linear discriminant analysis models, using non-stochastic and stochastic linear indices, were obtained. The models had shown an accuracy of 95.65% for the training set and 100% for the external prediction set. Next the prediction of the sigma-receptor antagonists of chiral 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidines by multiple linear regression analysis was carried out. Two statistically significant QSAR models were obtained when non-stochastic (R(2)=0.953 and s=0.238) and stochastic (R(2)=0.961 and s=0.219) 3D-chiral bilinear indices were used. These models showed adequate predictive power (assessed by the leave-one-out cross-validation experiment) yielding values of q(2)=0.935 (s(cv)=0.259) and q(2)=0.946 (s(cv)=0.235), respectively. Finally, the prediction of the corticosteroid-binding globulin binding affinity of steroids set was performed. The obtained results are rather similar to most of the 3D-QSAR approaches reported so far. The validation of this method was achieved by comparison with previous reports applied to the same data set. The non-stochastic and stochastic 3D-chiral linear indices appear to provide a very interesting alternative to other more common 3D-QSAR descriptors.", 
    "740": "Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are widely used in the treatment of hypertension. Through blood pressure reduction, and possibly other mechanisms such as antioxidative effects, they may play a role in diminishing the risk for a variety of cardiovascular outcomes. The combination of CCBs with other newer antihypertensive agents such, as ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, may provide complementary effects on risk reduction in cardiovascular adverse events and renal disease. Although the efficacy of CCBs as antihypertensive agents has been adequately demonstrated, there have been concerns regarding the use of short acting dihydropyridines after acute myocardial infarction. There have also been questions about the role of CCBs with regards to other antihypertensive agents in renal disease. For example, differential effects of dihydropyridine and non-dihydropyridine CCBs may affect progression of renal disease and risk for diabetes. Certain precautions involving drug interactions are needed because of the effects of CCBs on the CYP450 enzyme systems.",

ACE inhibitors are increasingly utilized in children with progressive renal disease. Because angiotensin is necessary for normal renal development, we examined the effects of ACE inhibition both during and immediately following the period of postnatal nephrogenesis in the neonatal rat subjected to sham operation or partial unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) under general anesthesia within the first 48 h of life. Rats in group I received enalapril 30 mg/kg body wt (or vehicle) daily for the first 10 days, while in group II, the 10 days of treatment began 10 days after surgery. Kidneys were harvested at day 21 and analyzed for apoptosis (TUNEL), interstitial macrophages (ED-1 immunohistochemistry), myofibroblasts (alpha-smooth muscle actin), and collagen (Sirius red). Partial UUO delayed glomerular maturation and increased ipsilateral renal macrophage infiltration, alpha-smooth muscle actin and Sirius red staining. In group I, enalapril increased myofibroblast accumulation in sham-operated kidneys, but not in obstructed kidneys. In contrast, in group II, enalapril further increased macrophage, myofibroblast, and collagen accumulation following partial UUO. The relative abundance of components of the kallikrein-kinin system, measured by Western blot, was not altered by partial UUO in the 14- and 28-day-old rat. Thus, in contrast to its salutary effects at later ages, ACE inhibition can worsen injury to the partially obstructed kidney during renal maturation even after the completion of nephrogenesis.",

Lipid peroxidation, catalase activity, GSH (reduced glutathione) and GSSG (oxidized glutathione) concentrations were determined in isolated rat liver mitochondria. Simultaneous treatment of mitochondria with captopril (0.08 mM)+paraquat (5 mM) significantly ameliorate the mitochondria toxicity induced by paraquat (5 mM) alone. The results confirm antioxidant effect of captopril. This effect appears to be attributable to the Sulfhydryl Groups (SH) in the compound which may be due to captopril abilities to scavenge reactive oxygen species.

For each case, age- and gender-matched community controls were recruited. Detailed information on drug use and potential confounders (e.g. comorbidity, alcohol use) was obtained through a structured interview.", 
    "768": "In all, 724 patients with acute pancreatitis and 1791 community controls were identified and interviewed. Use of ACE inhibitors in the week prior to the index date was associated with an increased risk of acute pancreatitis (adjusted odds ratio 1.5; 95% CI: 1.1-2.2). The risk of acute pancreatitis associated with ACE inhibitors increased with higher daily doses and was highest in the first 6 months of therapy. Calcium channel blockers increased the risk of acute pancreatitis (adjusted odds ratio 1.5; 95% CI: 1.1-2.1) without an apparent dose- or response relationship. Loop and thiazide diuretic use was not associated with an increased risk of acute pancreatitis. Potassium-sparing diuretics elevated the risk of acute pancreatitis, albeit non-significantly.",

    "774": "Increased coronary heart disease risk in HIV-positive patients using antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been a controversial topic since 1998 when the dyslipidaemic effect of protease inhibitors (PIs) was recognised. Accumulating evidence suggests an association between ART and increased coronary heart disease risk. In 2003, the large, prospective D:A:D (Data Collection on Adverse Events of Anti-HIV Drugs) study reported a 26% relative increase in the rate of myocardial infarction per year of exposure during the first 4-6 years of use. As the HIV-population grows older, infectious disease specialists have to consider unfamiliar areas of internal medicine such as lipid-lowering therapy and smoking cessation. Moreover, the ART regimen itself may be a modifiable risk factor, as there are both class differences and within-class differences in the tendency to increase lipids. Most nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), including the newer agents tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine, have little or no effect on lipid levels or glucose metabolism. One exception is the highly effective NRTI stavudine, which has a dyslipidaemic profile and a negative effect on glucose metabolism. In contrast the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor nevirapine may increase the 'good cholesterol' high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and thus reduce the total cholesterol : HDL cholesterol index. Most of the PIs have some dyslipidaemic effect, especially ritonavir (alone or in combination with other PIs), fosamprenavir and the novel PI tipranavir. Only atazanavir, and to some extent saquinavir, seem to have little effect on lipid levels and glucose metabolism. Studies on blood pressure in HIV-positive patients have been contradictory. Apart from a recent report from the D:A:D study where lower blood pressure was found in patients receiving NNRTIs, the influence of the individual drugs on blood pressure is unknown. When hypertension is detected in a HIV-positive patient, creatinine clearance (CL(CR)) should be calculated and the urine checked for proteinuria. When CL(CR) is <30 mL/min, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is not recommended. Many hypertensive HIV-positive patients have proteinuria and an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor antagonist is a better choice than a thiazide diuretic or calcium channel antagonist in these patients. In addition, physicians treating patients with ART should be especially aware of the long list of possible interactions between PIs and anti-hypertensive- and lipid-lowering drugs. This review discusses important clinical aspects of treating middle-aged HIV-positive patients who have an increased risk of experiencing a cardiovascular event.", 
    "775": "Monotherapy prevailing nowadays in the treatment of essential hypertension is one of the causes of not sufficiently effective hypotensive therapy. Combination of antihypertensive drugs is a more efficient strategy as synergism of applied medications may be reached and not high doses may develop less adverse effects. 30 patients (17 men and 13 women, average age is 51 years) with hypertension which have not taken antihypertensive drugs from different reasons have been prescribed Noliprel being a combination of Perindopril and Indapamid in low doses (2.00 mg and 0.625 mg accordingly) for 3 months. The study conducted by the author differs from the trials on Noliprel effectiveness by its more profound investigation of the echocardiography parameters and cardial hemodynamics. The measurement of left ventricular myocardium mass index, wall and interventricular septal thickness and many other echocardiographic parameters have been studied. Noliprel has already demonstrated good antihypertensive activity in 83.3% of patients after one month therapy. 16.7% of patient increased dose intake to two pills per day and after 3 months of the therapy their arterial pressure reached the target level. The author considered in details the dynamics of echocardiography parameters during therapy with Noliprel. Noliprel is a highly effective and safe medication which positively influences on processes of myocardium remodeling and is metabolically neutral.

BPPs present a classical motif and can be recognized by their typical pyroglutamyl (Pyr)/proline rich sequences presenting, invariably, a proline residue at the C-terminus. In the present study, we describe the isolation and biological characterization of a novel BPP isolated from the skin secretion of the Brazilian tree-frog Phyllomedusa hypochondrialis. This new BPP, named Phypo Xa presents the sequence Pyr-Phe-Arg-Pro-Ser-Tyr-Gln-Ile-Pro-Pro and is able to potentiate bradykinin activities in vivo and in vitro, as well as efficiently and competitively inhibit ACE. This is the first canonical BPP (i.e. Pyr-Aaa(n)-Gln-Ile-Pro-Pro) to be found not only in the frog skin but also in any other natural source other than the snake venoms.",

They have been found at high levels within the central nervous system where they have a direct effect on neuronal cells via peptidergic receptors. As relatively few studies have examined their metabolic stability in the brain, such investigation was performed to locate the cellular distribution of enzymatic activity against these peptides. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) combined with electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) allows identification of degradation products resulting from incubation of hemorphin-7 peptides (LVV-hemorphin-7, VV-hemorphin-7 and hemorphin-7) with subcellular fractions isolated from rat brain tissue. Metabolic activities were found against the three peptides in brain homogenate and subcellular fractions with the highest metabolic activity (<3% peptide remaining after 10 min) observed in the microsomal fraction which processed hemorphin-7 peptides mainly into N-terminal fragments (giving LVVH5) suggesting action of brain-membrane enzymes with C-terminal specificity. Incubation of the ACE inhibitor captopril (0.2 microM) with microsomal fraction, together with LVVH7, decreased the processing of LVVH7 to form LVVH5 by 85%.",

Recently, investigators have employed this cell line for studying influx of peptide prodrug derivatives of parent compounds, which are P-gp substrates. Therefore, the objective of this study is to functionally characterize the peptide mediated uptake and transport of [(3)H] Glycylsarcosine ([(3)H] Gly-Sar), a model peptide substrate across MDCKII-MDR1 cells. [(3)H] Gly-Sar uptake from apical (AP) and basolateral (BL) membranes was found to be time-dependent and saturable. Michaelis-Menten (K(m)) constants of [(3)H] Gly-Sar uptake across the AP and BL directions in MDCKII-MDR1 cell line were found to be 457+/-37 and 464+/-85microM, respectively. V(max) values in AP and BL directions for the peptide transporters in MDCKII-MDR1 cell line were calculated to be 0.035+/-0.001 and 0.35+/-0.034pmol/minmg protein, respectively. Uptake of [(3)H] Gly-Sar was significantly inhibited in the presence of aminocephalosporins and ACE-Inhibitors, known substrates for peptide transporters in both the AP and BL directions. Permeability of [(3)H] Gly-Sar in the BL direction was maximal at pH 4 as compared to pH 5, 6 and 7.4 whereas such permeability in the AP direction was optimal at pH 7.4. Transepithelial transport of [(3)H] Gly-Sar in the AP-BL direction was significantly lower than from BL-AP direction at all observed pHs. No statistical difference was observed in the transepithelial permeability of [(3)H] Gly-Sar across both AP and BL directions over 4-10 days of growth period. The present study indicates that peptide transporters are effectively involved in the bidirectional transport of Gly-Sar across MDCKII-MDR1 cell line; the BL peptide transporter can transport Gly-Sar at a greater rate as compared to the AP peptide transporter. Results from these studies suggest the application of MDCKII-MDR1 cell line as a rapid effective tool to study peptide mediated influx of compounds that may be substrates for both P-gp and peptide transporters.",

During follow-up 57.8% of patients were treated with eprosartan or ACE-inhibitors, 34.6% with beta-blockers. By the time of the final visit 80.5% of hypertensives had achieved improvement of systolic and/or diastolic blood pressures (29.1% normotensive). Patients with hypertensive ABPM at baseline had more cardiovascular events than normotensives (normotensives 3.0%; grade 1 7.8%, grade 2-3 9.8%).

Persons classified as stress- (or changing to stress-) had fewer events (6.2%) than those regarded as stress+ or changing to stress+ (7.1%).

    "792": "Angiotensin II (Ang II) increases adhesion molecules, cytokines and chemokines and exerts a proinflammatory effect on leucocytes, endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells. Acting via the type 1 receptor, Ang II initiates an inflammatory cascade of reduced nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nuclear factor-kappaB, which mediates transcription and gene expression and increases adhesion molecules and chemokines. An excess of ROS decreases nitric oxide bioavailability, causes endothelial dysfunction, and promotes atherosclerosis. Moreover, Ang II interrupts the anti-inflammatory effects of insulin. Together, these effects promote a prothrombotic state as well as plaque rupture. Ang II receptor blockers suppress mediators of inflammation, including ROS and C-reactive protein, and they increase expression of inhibitory kappaB (an inhibitor of nuclear factor-kappaB). These anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects, which are probably due in part to unopposed stimulation of the Ang II type 2 receptor, may be beneficial in acute coronary syndromes and may also contribute to the prevention of type II diabetes mellitus, as insulin resistance is mediated by inflammatory processes.",

    "798": "The public health burden of type 2 diabetes mellitus has been dramatically increasing world-wide. The chronic complications of type 2 diabetes play an important role in decreasing life expectancy and adversely affecting quality of life. Diabetic nephropathy, which is originally microvascular in nature, is widely considered an important complication of diabetes. In prospective clinical investigations, increased urinary albumin excretion proved to be associated not only with subsequent renal outcomes but also with cardiovascular morbidity/mortality independently of other risk factors. Therefore, microalbuminuria as an early sign of increased urinary albumin excretion should be considered important for both treatment and even for prevention. Preventing microalbuminuria might diminish progression to overt nephropathy and, hopefully, might limit cardiovascular events. Regarding primary prevention of diabetic nephropathy, therapeutic intervention should optimally be initiated at the stage of normoalbuminuria. Although additional factors such as smoking cessation, reduction of protein intake, and treatment of lipid abnormalities are important, providing optimal diabetic control as well as targeting optimal blood pressure are the key elements of a prevention strategy in diabetic patients. Recently, the Bergamo Nephrologic Diabetes Complications Trial (BENEDICT) documented that a significant decrease of the development of persistent microalbuminuria could be achieved by using an ACE-inhibitor, trandolapril alone or in combination with verapamil SR, a non-dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker in hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients with normoalbuminuria. The results of this primary-prevention strategy should be corroborated by further investigations to determine whether these beneficial changes could later result in improvement of renal clinical outcomes, macrovascular complications, or both.",

After six months, both ramipril and AVE7688 had markedly reduced plasma ACE activity, normalised blood pressure (BP), reduced left ventricular mass and improved systolic function to similar extents. Acetylcholine mediated relaxation of aortic rings was improved by both ramipril and AVE7688. There was substantial albuminuria in the placebo group (albumin-to-creatinine ratio 107+/-54 microg/mg), which was significantly reduced by ramipril to 57+/-34 microg/mg, and practically abolished in the AVE7688 group (22+/-12 microg/mg, p<0.05 vs. placebo and ramipril). Tubulo-interstitial damage (semi-quantitative score) was significantly reduced by AVE7688 and ramipril.

Imidapril is a long-acting ACE inhibitor that is rapidly converted in the liver to its active metabolite, imidaprilat. Maximum plasma concentrations of imidapril and imidaprilat are achieved after 2 and 5-6 hours, respectively, with corresponding elimination half-lives of 1.1-2.5 and 10-19 hours. Imidapril is used in the treatment of hypertension, chronic heart failure, acute MI and diabetic nephropathy. In patients with mild-to-moderate chronic heart failure, imidapril 10 mg once-daily increased exercise time and physical working capacity, decreased plasma atrial natriuretic peptide and brain natriuretic peptide levels and reduced blood pressure. It also improved left ventricular ejection fraction, being significantly more effective than bisoprolol, in patients with acute MI. Imidapril is well tolerated and preliminary studies suggest it has an advantage over captopril and enalapril in terms of a lower incidence of cough. In conclusion, imidapril is a well-investigated versatile ACE inhibitor for the treatment of a range of cardiovascular diseases.",

Studied were 35 patients with diabetes (18 with type 1 and 17 with type 2) and 69 age-matched healthy subjects with para-aminohippurate and inulin clearances and their response to captopril. All patients with diabetes had normal renal function and no microalbuminuria. Prorenin was calculated as the difference between total renin and active renin. Active renin level in patients with diabetes (11.6 +/- 0.9 microU/ml) was significantly lower than in normal subjects (14.5 +/- 1.3 microU/ml; P < 0.05); despite this, the renal vascular response to captopril was much larger (82.9 +/- 11.5 versus 13.6 +/- 5.8 ml/min per 1.73 m(2); P < 0.01). Prorenin in both patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes (175.7 +/- 15.1 microU/ml) also was significantly higher than in normal subjects (128 +/- 5.8 microU/ml; P < 0.01). Active renin correlated with prorenin in normal subjects (r = 0.44, P = 0.0002), and this correlation was much more striking in patients with diabetes (r = 0.72, P = 0.0001). The active renin and prorenin correlation was identical in type 1 and type 2 diabetes. There was a clear correlation between plasma prorenin and the renovascular response to captopril in patients with diabetes (P < 0.01) but not in normal subjects (P > 0.13). The strong correlation between plasma prorenin concentration and the renovascular response to captopril in diabetes supports the hypothesis of a direct effect of prorenin, but the unanticipated high degree of correlation between plasma prorenin and active renin limits the conclusions that can be drawn.", 
    "804": "Hypertension is often associated with an impairment of glucose tolerance and is a risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The occurrence of diabetes may be also influenced by the selection of the type of antihypertensive treatment. While it has been shown that the use of older type antihypertensives - diuretics and beta-blockers - may precipitate diabetes, newer drugs which inhibit the renin-angiotensin system have a positive effect on glucose tolerance. Several recent clinical trials of ACE-inhibitors and AT1-blockers have demonstrated a decreased risk of the occurrence of diabetes in comparison with placebo or conventional antihypertensive drugs. The mechanisms responsible for the antidiabetic effect of these newer antihypertensive agents remain largely speculative. Insulin resistance may be improved in several ways, e.g. by changes in microcirculation or direct effects on insulin response and glucose transport in target organ cells. However, as shown in experimental studies, improved islet function and insulin secretion may also have role due to an inhibitory effect on the local renin-angiotensin system in the pancreas. Ongoing prospective clinical trials having the occurrence of diabetes as a primary specified endpoint should confirm the preventive potential of the inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system. Since direct comparisons are lacking, current data are inconclusive as to the superiority of one of the two classes of these inhibitors or of any single drug. Nevertheless, inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system should definitely represent first choice antihypertensive agents for persons with additional risk factors such as family history of diabetes, obesity or impaired glucose tolerance.",

    "813": "Copayment level, independent of other determinants, was found to be a strong predictor of compliance with antihypertensive medications, with greater compliance seen among patients filing pharmacy claims for drugs that required lower copayments. This finding suggests that patient use is sensitive to price. The potential impact on compliance should be considered when making pricing and policy decisions.", 
    "814": "The blood pressure-lowering dose-response relationship for angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors is assumed to flatten at doses higher than those conventionally used in clinical practice. However, existing clinical trial data do not adequately address the haemodynamic effects of high ACE inhibitor dosages. Therefore, we examined the blood pressure responses in patients presenting to hospital following a deliberate ACE inhibitor overdose.", 
    "815": "The study design was a retrospective case review, and included all patients who presented to our hospital in the past 5 years after an ACE inhibitor overdose. The data collected were heart rate and systemic blood pressure at various times after ingestion and maximum haemodynamic derangement; these were compared to baseline or recovered values.", 
    "816": "Data from 33 patients (24 men) were evaluated. The median (inter-quartile range, IQR) age of the patients was 49 years (IQR: 42-56 years). The median stated dose ingested was 140 mg (IQR: 60-280 mg), which is 20x (IQR: 7-42) the defined daily dose. The maximum fall in systolic blood pressure was 50 mmHg (IQR: 40-64 mmHg), diastolic blood pressure was 35 mmHg (IQR: 26-43 mmHg) and mean blood pressure was 39 mmHg (IQR: 30-47 mmHg).", 
    "817": "The observed reduction in blood pressure following an overdose of an ACE inhibitor was greater than anticipated based on data from therapeutic doses. We conclude that a blood pressure-lowering dose-response relationship extends to higher ACE inhibitor doses than those conventionally used in clinical practice.", 
    "818": "In the treatment for the hypertension patients with diabetes mellitus, the target blood pressure is below 130/80mmHg. As the first choice drugs, ARB, ACE inhibitor and Ca channel blocker are recommended. In the high normal blood pressure patient (130-139/80-89mmHg), the initial approach is life-style modification. In hypertension patients with diabetes (over 140/90mmHg), blood pressure should be controlled with the medication. The life-style modification should be performed even in the patients treated with anti-hypertensive drugs.", 
    "819": "Diabetes mellitus is a well-recognized risk-factor for coronary artery disease. It is known that diabetic patients have a two-to fourfold increased risk of mortality or morbidity for cardiovascular diseases compared with the general population. Further, many diabetic patients with coronary heart disease have severe diseased coronary arteries: multi-vessel disease and/or severe stenosed vessel(s). In Japan, the prevalence of diabetic patients is rapidly increasing in these days. This article will review the evaluation for risk of coronary heart disease by measuring glucose level, the prognosis of diabetic patients, and the prevention of cardiovascular event in the patients with diabetes mellitus.", 
    "820": "Decisions about chronic treatments during the perioperative period must be made at the presurgical anesthesia consultation. It is increasingly rare to stop treatment during this period, because: This new rule is applied particularly to patients with cardiovascular disorders. Beta blockers have a special role in preventing the onset of postoperative cardiovascular events. The role of statins requires further precision but they appear to fit into the same preventive approach. Interruption of antiplatelet agents appears to be associated with a risk of arterial thrombosis in patients with coronary conditions, notably those with conventional stents and most especially those with drug-eluting stents.", 
    "821": "It is unclear whether single and combined pharmacologic inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system have similar effects on endothelial function and blood pressure (BP). The authors evaluated 63 hypertensive patients divided into 4 groups (hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg/d; irbesartan [IRBE] 150 mg/d; quinapril [QUIN] 20 mg/d; or IRBE 150 mg/d + QUIN 20 mg/d) and 25 healthy normotensive subjects (normal) followed for 12 weeks. Endothelium-dependent dysfunction measured as flow-mediated dilation at Weeks 0 and 12 were: normal, 11.5%+/-2.4% vs 13.5%+/-2.0%; hydrochlorothiazide, 7.3%+/-2.0% vs 12.8%+/-3.1%; QUIN, 7.2%+/-2.8% vs 13.2%+/-2.1%; IRBE, 7.1%+/-2.8% vs 13.0%+/-2.9%; and IRBE + QUIN, 7.5%+/-1.9% vs 12.8%+/-3.0%. Nitroglycerin-mediated responses were: normal, 26.0%+/-1.9% vs 24.0%+/-2.5%; hydrochlorothiazide, 17.0%+/-2.2% vs 18.3%+/-2.6%; QUIN, 17.8%+/-3.2% vs 23.4%+/-3.0%; IRBE, 16.8%+/-3.6% vs 24.7%+/-2.0%; and IRBE + QUIN, 17.3%+/-3.0% vs 25.1%+/-2.5%. Antihypertensive therapy restored BP to normal and improved the endothelium-dependent and -independent dysfunction after renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade. In a further finding, the combined effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockade was not superior to the action of either of these treatments separately.", 
    "822": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) may play a role in vascular aging. The authors hypothesized that blockade of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor with an angiotensin receptor blocker in healthy elderly subjects improves vascular compliance and endothelial function. Thirty-five healthy elderly subjects were randomized to valsartan or placebo in a double-blind crossover study after baseline testing for pulse wave velocity, aortic augmentation index, and brachial artery flow-mediated dilation. Angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockade with valsartan improved vascular compliance but not flow-mediated dilation. Changes in pulse wave velocity with valsartan were correlated with change in central systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure and remained associated on multivariate analysis. Change in pulse wave velocity after adjusting for degree of blood pressure change, age, and sex remained correlated with assignment to the angiotensin receptor blocker but not placebo. These data suggest that angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockade improves aging-related vascular compliance without alterations in flow-mediated dilation. Mechanisms regulating compliance and endothelial function are complex and may not necessarily converge in aging.",

    "824": "Data of 2,311 successive angina patients from the International EECP Patient Registry were analyzed, 86.5% completed their EECP course (Complete cohort). Of the 13.5% patients failing to complete the initial course (Incomplete cohort), 28.3% had repeat EECP within 1 year vs. 10.1% of the Complete group. The predictors of failure to complete the initial course of EECP were: female gender, heart failure, use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, and use of nitroglycerin. For the Complete group, 83.4% had a reduction of at least one Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) class after their initial EECP course, vs. 21.7% in the Incomplete group (p < 0.001). After repeat treatment, 66.2% of the Incomplete group achieved at least one CCS class reduction vs. 69.4% of the Complete group (p = NS) undergoing retreatment. The independent predictors for those who return to successfully complete their second course were patients who stopped their first course because of clinical events, and candidacy for coronary artery bypass grafting at the time of initial treatment.",

    "826": "Previous reports show that bradykinin B(2) receptors mediate contractile responses induced by bradykinin (BK) in human umbilical artery (HUA). However, although it has been reported that BK-induced responses can desensitize in several inflammatory models, the effects of prolonged in vitro incubation on BK-induced vasoconstriction in HUA have not been studied. In isolated HUA rings, BK-induced responses after a 5-h in vitro incubation showed a marked desensitization compared with responses at 2 h. Inhibition of either angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) or neutral endopeptidase (NEP), both BK-inactivating enzymes, failed to modify responses to BK at 2 h. After 5 h, ACE inhibition produced only a slight potentiation of BK-induced responses. In contrast, BK-induced vasoconstriction at 5 h was markedly potentiated by NEP inhibition. Moreover, NEP activity, measured by hydrolysis of its synthetic substrate (Z-Ala-Ala-Leu-p-nitroanilide), showed a 2.4-fold increase in 5-h incubated versus 2-h incubated tissues, which was completely reversed by cycloheximide (CHX) treatment. Furthermore, CHX significantly potentiated BK-induced responses, suggesting that NEP-mediated kininase activity increase at 5 h depends on de novo protein synthesis. In addition, under NEP inhibition, CHX treatment failed to produce an additional potentiation of BK-induced vasoconstriction. Still, NEP up-regulation was confirmed by Western blot, showing a 2.1-fold increase in immunoreactive NEP in 5-h incubated versus 2-h incubated HUA. In summary, the present study provides strong pharmacological evidence that NEP is up-regulated and plays a key role in desensitization of BK-induced vasoconstriction after prolonged in vitro incubation in HUA. Our results provide new insights into the possible mechanisms involved in BK-induced response desensitization during sustained inflammatory conditions.", 
    "827": "Angioedema, characterized by swelling of the lips, face, and tongue, occurs in anywhere from 0.1% to 6% of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor users. The incidence is more common in black Americans than in white Americans, in women than in men, and in smokers than in nonsmokers. The remitting and relapsing nature of ACE inhibitor-associated angioedema can confound clinical recognition of the adverse event but also provides clues to its causes. Defective degradation of vasoactive peptide substrates of ACE, such as bradykinin or substance P, may contribute via non-ACE pathways to the pathogenesis of ACE inhibitor-associated angioedema.", 
    "828": "Hypertension remains one of the primary causes of preventable death in developed countries. Universally accepted clinical practice guidelines based on well designed trials are needed to ensure standardized treatment for these patients. It has been hypothesized that agents such as calcium channel antagonists and ACE inhibitors may be more effective than beta-adrenoceptor antagonist (beta-blocker)- or diuretic-based regimens. However, until recently, there have been limited data on the efficacy of 'newer' antihypertensive regimens, particularly combination therapy, relative to standard therapeutic options. The ASCOT-BPLA (Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial-Blood Pressure Lowering Arm), a prospective, randomized, controlled trial in >19 250 patients with hypertension, highlights the benefit of a combined amlodipine plus perindopril regimen over an atenolol plus diuretic-based combination in terms of significant reductions (p < 0.05) in all-cause mortality, total cardiovascular events and procedures, and fatal and nonfatal stroke. The ASCOT-BPLA trial underlines the cardiovascular benefit of ACE inhibitors, specifically perindopril, beyond that provided by BP reduction, and potentially reflects a mechanistic feature of the ACE inhibitors. It also suggests that the combination of amlodipine plus perindopril may provide broad-spectrum cardiovascular protection, as well as reduce the incidence of new-onset diabetes mellitus and renal impairment, in addition to its efficacy in lowering BP. The ASCOT-BPLA trial provides evidence of the need to reconsider traditional prescribing recommendations in patients with hypertension, particularly conclusions reached in the US after the publication of the ALLHAT (Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial) study. The recently published National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines in the UK emphasize the efficacy of ACE inhibitors as first-line agents for hypertensive patients <55 years of age and recommend ACE inhibitor therapy at any stage of hypertension management.", 
    "829": "Hypertension is a well documented risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and substantially contributes to the global burden of disease. Different drug options exist for combination therapy as part of an overall control of risk factors in order to decrease the absolute risk of CVD. Several guidelines in recent years have tried to set up recommendations to increase the proportion of subjects in acceptable BP control from high-risk groups. Some conventional drugs are still very important in modern hypertension treatment, e.g. low-dose thiazide diuretics. However, newer compounds have added to the list of useful agents to be used as monotherapy or in combination therapy for improved target organ protection, e.g. the calcium channel antagonists and ACE inhibitors. The role of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (beta-blockers) has changed somewhat as a result of critical comments from recent meta-analyses. Currently, therefore, beta-blockers are recommended less often for primary prevention and monotherapy, but should still be used for secondary prevention, combination therapy, and for symptom relief. Finally, the new angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists (angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) are still rather expensive, but have been increasingly documented in clinical trials for patients with essential hypertension. One controversial aspect is whether ARBs are better, worse, or equal to standard therapy with an ACE inhibitor for cardiovascular protection. BP remains poorly controlled in a large number of hypertensive patients and there is a greater need to control all relevant CVD risk factors in such patients. Therefore, different drugs are needed in order to be used in evidence-based synergistic and cost-effective drug combinations.", 
    "830": "Recent evidence points to a role for the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and its complications, including acute angina pectoris. Two large trials in heart failure have clearly demonstrated that blocking aldosterone improves mortality and that this benefit occurs over and above standard therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. The question that naturally arises from these landmark studies is whether aldosterone blockade would produce the same benefits in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) but no heart failure. There are three reasons to believe this might be the case. Firstly, angiotensin II (Ang II) and aldosterone produce similar biological effects and Ang II withdrawal has been shown to benefit patients with angina; aldosterone blockade may therefore follow in the footsteps of ACE inhibitors, as it did in heart failure, and produce benefits in vascular patients without heart failure. Secondly, one of the main mechanisms which is thought to be responsible for the benefit of aldosterone blockade in the Randomised ALdactone Evaluation Study (RALES) and Eplerenone Post-AMI Heart Failure Survival Study (EPHESUS), is that it improves endothelial/vascular function and endothelial/vascular dysfunction is the fundamental abnormality in angina pectoris. Finally, aldosterone blockade has been shown to reduce atherosclerosis in animal studies of atherosclerosis without heart failure, which are analogous to CAD patients.", 
    "831": "More than a century of research on the reninangiotensin system (RAS) has uncovered the widespread involvement of angiotensin II (Ang II) in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular diseases. A number of outcomes-based mega trials utilising hard clinical endpoints have revealed beneficial effects of angiotensin receptor antagonists (AIIAs/ARBs) in patients with hypertension, heart failure, diabetic nephropathy, and post-myocardial infarction (MI). The results of these studies not only emphasise the importance of Ang II in the pathophysiology of these diseases but have provided the basis for an evidence-based approach for the use of AIIAs in clinical practice. It is hoped that the next 100 years of research into the RAS will uncover hitherto unimaginable therapeutic opportunities.", 
    "832": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may reduce urinary albumin excretion (UAE) by decreasing glomerular pressure and increasing glomerular charge selectivity through preservation of glycosaminoglycans. The effect of Angiotensin II antagonism on glomerular charge selectivity remains to be determined. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of an AT1 blocker losartan and an ACE inhibitor (ACE-I) enalapril on UAE, extracellular matrix proteins, glycosaminoglycan excretion (UGAG) and red blood cell anionic charge (RBCCh) which are the indirect markers of glomerular basement membrane anionic content in hypertensive Type 2 diabetic patients. Twenty-four patients were randomised into two groups and received either enalapril (520 mg/d) or losartan (50100 mg/d). All parameters were measured at baseline and after six months of treatment. At the end of six months, systolic and diastolic blood pressures (BP), UAE rates, UGAG excretion and RBCCh were significantly and equally reduced in both treatment groups compared with baseline. RBCCh was negatively correlated with UAE (r=-0.57, p<0.0001) and UGAG excretion (r=-0.57, p<0.0001); UAE was correlated with UGAG excretion (r=0.58, p<0.0001). In conclusion, enalapril and losartan treatment were equally effective in reducing BP, UAE as well as UGAG excretion and preserving RBCCh in hypertensive Type 2 diabetic patients. ACE inhibition and AT1-receptor blockade may have favourable effects on preserving glomerular anionic content in hypertensive diabetic patients.", 
    "833": "A joint initiative between the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) and the British Hypertension Society (BHS) has led to the publication of new guidelines for the management of hypertension in the community. Recent trial evidence highlighting the increased incidence of new-onset diabetes in those exposed to beta-blocker-based treatment regimens, with or without diuretics, compared with those based on calcium channel blockers (CCBs) or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE-Is) inhibitors has led to a recommendation that in the uncomplicated patient, beta-blockers are no longer considered suitable options for first-line therapy. Together with mounting evidence that age and ethnicity dictate blood pressure (BP) responsiveness to different classes of antihypertensive drugs, the ACD algorithm is now proposed (formerly ABCD), with ACE inhibitors (ACE-Is) (or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs] when ACE-Is are poorly tolerated) preferred in younger patients and CCBs or diuretics preferred for older patients and in black patients of any age. Pathophysiological considerations have influenced proposals for combination therapies with CCBs or diuretics added to ACE-Is in younger patients and vice versa in older patients. Health economic analyses have clearly indicated the cost effectiveness of CCBs which are now elevated to equal standing with diuretics in older patients.", 
    "834": "Recruitment of neutrophils to the lung is a sentinel event in acute lung inflammation. Identifying mechanisms that regulate neutrophil recruitment to the lung may result in strategies to limit lung damage and improve clinical outcomes. Recently, the renin angiotensin system (RAS) has been shown to regulate neutrophil influx in acute inflammatory models of cardiac, neurologic, and gastrointestinal disease. As a role for the RAS in LPS-induced acute lung inflammation has not been described, we undertook this study to examine the possibility that the RAS regulates neutrophil recruitment to the lung after LPS exposure. Pretreatment of mice with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril, but not the anti-hypertensive hydralazine, decreased pulmonary neutrophil recruitment after exposure to LPS. We hypothesize that inhibition of LPS-induced neutrophil accumulation to the lung with enalapril occurred through both an increase in bradykinin, and a decrease in angiotensin II (ATII), mediated signaling. Bradykinin receptor blockade reversed the inhibitory effect of enalapril on neutrophil recruitment. Similarly, pretreatment with bradykinin receptor agonists inhibited IL-8-induced neutrophil chemotaxis and LPS-induced neutrophil recruitment to the lung. Inhibition of ATII-mediated signaling, with the ATII receptor 1a inhibitor losartan, decreased LPS-induced pulmonary neutrophil recruitment, and this was suggested to occur through decreased PAI-1 levels. LPS-induced PAI-1 levels were diminished in animals pretreated with losartan and in those deficient for the ATII receptor 1a. Taken together, these results suggest that ACE regulates LPS-induced pulmonary neutrophil recruitment via modulation of both bradykinin- and ATII-mediated pathways, each regulating neutrophil recruitment by separate, but distinct, mechanisms.", 
    "835": "For assessment of the independent renoprotective effect of BP control and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) therapy, the relationships of baseline BP, BP reduction, and follow-up BP with the incidence of persistent microalbuminuria were evaluated in 1204 hypertensive patients who had type 2 diabetes and normoalbuminuria and were included in the BErgamo Nephrologic Diabetic Complications Trial (BENEDICT) study and were randomly assigned to 3.6 yr of treatment with the ACEi trandolapril (2 mg/d), the nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (ndCCB) verapamil SR (240 mg/d), their fixed combination Veratran (trandolapril 2 mg/d plus verapamil SR 180 mg/d), or placebo, plus other antihypertensive medications targeted at systolic/diastolic BP <130/80 mmHg. Follow-up (from month 3 to study end) systolic, diastolic, mean, and pulse BP and their reductions versus baseline--but not baseline BP--independently predicted (P < 0.001) the risk for microalbuminuria. In patients with follow-up BP above medians, ACEi significantly reduced the risk for microalbuminuria to levels that were observed among patients with BP below medians, regardless of ACEi treatment. The same trend was observed among patients with BP reductions below medians. ndCCB therapy did not independently affect microalbuminuria. Patients who were on Veratran had lower BP and less frequently received diuretics, beta blockers, or dihydropyridine dCCB. In hypertensive, normoalbuminuric patients with type 2 diabetes, BP reduction and ACEi therapy both independently may prevent microalbuminuria. ACEi therapy is particularly effective when BP is poorly controlled, whereas ndCCB therapy is ineffective at any level of achieved BP. As compared with trandolapril, Veratran may help with achievement of target BP with less need for concomitant antihypertensive medications.", 
    "836": "The specific role of vasopressin in colonic crypt function and its possible synergistic action with aldosterone were studied. Sprague-Dawley rats fed a high-Na+ (HS; 150 mM NaCl) or a low-Na+ (LS; 150 microM NaCl) diet were deprived of water or infused with vasopressin, and some animals were treated with specific vasopressin receptor subtype V1 and V2 antagonists. The expression of the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC), alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) and aquaporin-2 (AQP-2) were determined by immunolocalization in distal colonic mucosa. The pericryptal Na+ concentration was determined by confocal microscopy, using a low-affinity Na+-sensitive fluorescent dye (sodium red) and crypt permeability was measured by the rate of escape of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labelled dextran (10 kDa) from the crypt lumen into the pericryptal space in isolated rat distal colonic mucosa. A high plasma concentration of vasopressin raised alpha-SMA expression in the pericryptal sheath (P < 0.05), increased the pericryptal Na+ accumulation in this space (P < 0.01) and caused a reduction of crypt wall permeability (P < 0.01). All these effects were reversed by selective blockade of V1 and V2 receptors. No synergistic effects with aldosterone were observed. Dehydration and vasopressin infusion increased AQP-2 expression in distal colonic mucosa (P < 0.05). This action of vasopressin was prevented by tolvaptan, a specific V2 receptor antagonist (P < 0.05). It is concluded that vasopressin has trophic effects in the rat distal colon, increasing pericryptal myofibroblast growth which affects crypt absorption, and these effects are independent of the presence of aldosterone.", 
    "837": "Zofenopril, an inhibitor of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), has recently been widely introduced into the pharmaceutical market. Its clinical safety and efficacy has been demonstrated in patients with hypertension and in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The Survival of Myocardial Infarction Long-term Evaluation (SMILE) project provided valuable information regarding the safety of early onset ACE inhibition with zofenopril after AMI and a greater perception of the early and late benefits. The SMILE-I study demonstrated that most benefits of ACE inhibition may be obtained early after AMI and persist after discontinuation of treatment. The SMILE-II study demonstrated that early zofenopril treatment (initiated <12 h) is safe and associated with a low rate of severe hypotension in thrombolyzed patients with acute myocardial infarction when administered in accordance with an adequate dose-titration scheme. Many other studies of clinical ACE-inhibitors (ACEIs) over the last 30 years have provided us with information in order to understand the effects of ACEIs and have demonstrated that patients benefit from ACEI treatment at different stages of the pathophysiological continuum of cardiovascular diseases. The current guidelines recommend that ACEIs should be used for routine secondary prevention in all patients with coronary artery disease and should be considered for all other patients with coronary or other vascular disease unless contraindicated.", 
    "838": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been associated with an increased risk of acute pancreatitis. The pathogenesis of this condition remains unclear, but an activation of the kinin system and a resultant localized angioedema have been implicated in the initial step leading to acute pancreatic damage. The goal of the present study was to explore the impact of ACE inhibition on pancreatic microcirculation and capillary permeability in normal and insulin-resistant rats.", 
    "839": "Chow- or fructose-fed Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with enalapril (dosage, 10 mg.kg.d) or vehicle for 4 weeks before measuring in vivo the extravasation of Evans blue (EB) dye in pancreas. Unanesthetized animals (n = 10-17 per group) were injected with EB 20 mg.kg in the caudal vein 10 minutes before killing, and EB dye was extracted from each pancreas by using formamide.", 
    "840": "Relative to controls, enalapril-treated animals showed a 5-fold increase in pancreatic extravasation of EB in the fructose-fed rat model (P < 0.001); smaller changes (2-fold) were observed in the chow-fed animals treated with enalapril (P < 0.001). The increase in pancreatic vasopermeability observed with enalapril in the fructose-fed animals was accompanied by a significant increase in total pancreatic nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity compared to controls (Delta = +128%; P < 0.001). This increase in NOS activity seemed to be solely attributable to an upregulation of the endothelial NOS isoform because only the eNOS immunoreactive mass (as opposed to nNOS) seemed to be increased in the pancreas of these animals. Treatment with enalapril was not associated with any increase in serum amylase concentrations in either animal subgroup.", 
    "841": "Enalapril increases capillary permeability (extravasation of macromolecules) in the pancreas of the fructose-fed rat model. This suggests that ACE inhibition upregulates the eNOS isoform locally, increases vasopermeability of the pancreas, and can therefore result in local edema in the fructose-fed insulin-resistant rat model.", 
    "842": "A transgenic mouse model, deficient in kinin B(1) receptor (B(1)(-/-)) was used to evaluate the role of B(2) receptor in the smooth muscle stomach fundus. The results showed that the potency of bradykinin (BK) to induce contraction in the gastric tissue was maintained whereas the efficacy was markedly reduced. The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril potentiated BK-induced effect in wild type (WT) but not in B(1)(-/-) fundus. However, ACE activity detected by the convertion of Ang I to Ang II was inhibited by captopril in both types of gastric tissues. Taking into account the hypothesis that captopril and ACE bind to the B(2) receptor, we suggest that this complex was not formed in the stomach deficient in B(1) receptor. Therefore, our finding strongly support the hypothesis that in smooth muscles that constitutively express the kinin B(1) and B(2) receptors, an interaction between captopril and ACE, B(1) and B(2) receptors should occur forming a complex protein interaction for the potentiating effect of ACE on kinin receptors.",

Whereas the role of angiotensin II in mediating progressive renal disease and heart failure has been documented extensively, more recent evidence has implicated aldosterone as an important pathogenetic factor in addition to angiotensin II in the development of these diseases. The focus of this review is aldosterone and progressive renal dysfunction. The extensive preclinical and clinical evidence supporting the efficacy of aldosterone blockade in abrogating proteinuria is summarized. The frequency and clinical importance of aldosterone \"escape\" is reviewed. Therapeutic considerations to reduce the incidence of hyperkalemia with aldosterone blockade are discussed. The studies reviewed have several important clinical implications for considering new treatment algorithms for patients with incipient nephropathy. Because full doses of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers attenuate but do not abrogate progression of renal dysfunction, add-on aldosterone blockade therapy may constitute a rational therapeutic strategy for retarding progression of renal disease.", 
    "890": "Inadequate blood flow and increased vasoconstriction of the placenta contribute to pregnancy associated disorders such as preeclampsia (PE). Because placental vessels lack autonomic innervation, humoral effects of the placenta must play critical roles in regulation of fetal-placental vascular contractility. In this study, we examined the nature of humoral factors produced by PE trophoblasts on placental vessel contractility using an organ bath perfusion model. Vasomotor responses were studied in vitro using placental chorionic plate arteries. Vessel rings from third branch chorionic plate arteries were dissected from human placentas following normal or PE delivery. The arterial rings were equilibrated in Krebs Henseleit buffer and exposed to placental conditioned medium, which was prepared by culture of villous tissue from PE placentas. Receptor antagonists for angiotensin II (ANG II), thromboxane (TX), and endothelin (ET) were used to determine which humoral factor produced by placental tissue (trophoblasts) was more effective in promoting vasoconstriction. The role of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and non-ACE ANG II generating enzymes in regulation of placental vasomotor tone were also investigated. A total of 80 arterial rings from 48 placentas were studied. Our results showed: 1) enhanced vasomotor tone in arteries from PE placentas compared to those from normal placentas; 2) PE-CM induced vaso-constrictive activity could be partially attenuated by receptor antagonists for TX, ANG II and ET, respectively; and 3) chymostatin (a chymase inhibitor) produced a stronger inhibitory effect than captopril (ACE inhibitor) on PE conditioned medium induced vasoconstriction. Our data demonstrate increased vasocontractility in PE placentas and suggest that the non-ACE pathway is probably a major source of ANG II produced in the human placenta.", 
    "891": "The role of angiotensin II, the key mediator of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease is well known. Pharmacologic interruption of the activity of angiotensin II, either through blockade of the angiotensin receptor or inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme, is associated with a reduction in cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality, as evidenced by accumulated data from large-scale, well-controlled clinical trials in high-risk populations. As the underlying mechanisms of vascular disease and the effects of blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system on these processes have been further defined, the therapeutic focus has begun to shift toward prevention of disease progression at earlier stages. Continued research has identified early signs of vascular disease, such as endothelial dysfunction and vascular and cardiac remodeling, which occur long before clinical manifestations of cardiovascular disease become evident. Diagnostic tests are now available to assess otherwise healthy individuals for these signs.

The dogs in control group and Cilazapril group were paced at 400 beats per minute for 6 weeks. The dogs in Cilazapril group received Cilazapril (0.5 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)) 1 week before rapid atrial pacing until pacing stop. Before and after 6-week rapid atrial pacing, atrial effective refractory period (AERP) at 8 sites, AERP dispersion, intraatrium conduction time, inducibility, and duration of AF were measured. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiographic examinations included left atrium (LA) maximal volume, LA minimal volume, LA ejection fraction, left atrial appendage (LAA) maximal volume, LAA minimal volume, LAA ejection fraction, LAA maximal forward flow velocity, and LAA minimal backward flow velocity were performed.

The post-tachycardia intraatrium conduction times after 6 weeks with Cilazapril were significantly shorter than those in the control group. Cliazapril could partially prevent AERP dispersion increase induced by chronic rapid atrial pacing. Compared with the control group, the LA and LAA volumes were significantly smaller; LA ejection fraction, LAA ejection fraction, LAA maximal forward flow velocity, and LAA minimal backward flow velocity were dramatically higher in the Cilazapril group.

No differences were observed between normotensive CRF and healthy subjects. ESRD subjects exhibited a dramatic increase in Ang-(1-7) (25-fold higher than control values). In hypertensive CRF subjects, treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) increased (1.4-fold) plasma Ang-(1-7) and decreased (2.4-fold) Ang II. In ESRD, the use of ACEi produced a similar (1.5-fold) elevation of Ang-(1-7), but no changes in plasma Ang II.

The study evaluated 2738 non-diabetic subjects without micro-albuminuria at inclusion who were then followed prospectively. At 6 years, 254 individuals (9.3%) had developed pathological micro-albuminuria (> or =20 mg/l) measured at micturation. In both sexes, the incidence of micro-albuminuria was associated with increased waist circumference and blood pressure, but not with blood glucose levels, lipid parameters or body mass index. Subjects with a higher waist circumference at inclusion were at a higher risk of having micro-albuminuria at 6 years compared to those with a normal waist circumference. Logical regression analysis showed that waist circumference as a continuous value, or greater than 94 cm for males and 88 cm for females, were predictive factors for the incidence of micro-albuminuria, after adjustment for age, hypertension, ACE inhibitor usage, fibrinogen, and blood glucose level. Abdominal adiposity is thus linked in both sexes to the development of microalbuminuria, which underlines the importance of measuring waist circumference when assessing risk factors for renal lesions in non-diabetic hypertensives.",

There were no significant differences in treatment decisions nor in drug choices for first-line monotherapy, which were diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor antagonists in both groups of physicians. Blood pressure alone was the most important factor for instituting drug therapy according to 59% of the GPs and 56% of the specialists. There was no association between pre-treatment risk assessment and instituting treatment in either group in four out of five cases. Conclusions.

Sitting office and home blood pressure was measured using electronic devices A&D 767. A total of 211 patients were randomized, and 185 completed the study. Of 52 subjects randomized to felodipine, 15 were withdrawn due to ankle edema.

There were no differences in the efficacy of the four combinations assessed using office or home blood pressure monitoring. These data suggest that diuretics, dihydropyridines, ACE inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers provide significant additional antihypertensive effects in hypertensive patients uncontrolled on diltiazem monotherapy.

In this study, we show that these premises are met in a model of s.c. infection by Trypanosoma cruzi, a protozoan that liberates kinins from kininogens through its major protease, cruzipain. Intensity of B(2)R-dependent paw edema evoked by trypomastigotes correlated with levels of IL-12 produced by CD11c(+) dendritic cells isolated from draining lymph nodes. The IL-12 response induced by endogenously released kinins was vigorously increased in infected mice pretreated with inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), a kinin-degrading metallopeptidase. Furthermore, these innate stimulatory effects were linked to B(2)R-dependent up-regulation of IFN-gamma production by Ag-specific T cells. Strikingly, the trypomastigotes failed to up-regulate type 1 immunity in TLR2(-/-) mice, irrespective of ACE inhibitor treatment. Analysis of the dynamics of inflammation revealed that TLR2 triggering by glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored mucins induces plasma extravasation, thereby favoring peripheral accumulation of kininogens in sites of infection. Further downstream, the parasites generate high levels of innate kinin signals in peripheral tissues through the activity of cruzipain. The demonstration that the deficient type 1 immune responses of TLR2(-/-) mice are rescued upon s.c. injection of exogenous kininogens, along with trypomastigotes, supports the notion that generation of kinin \"danger\" signals is intensified through cooperative activation of TLR2 and B(2)R. In summary, we have described a s.c. infection model where type 1 immunity is vigorously up-regulated by bradykinin, an innate signal whose levels in peripheral tissues are controlled by an intricate interplay of TLR2, B(2)R, and ACE.", 
    "956": "Left ventricular (LV) remodeling after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) has been well described in previous studies. However, there is a paucity of data on the incidence of and risk factors for LV remodeling in modern clinical practice that incorporates widespread use of acute reperfusion strategies and almost systematic use of \"antiremodeling\" medications, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta blockers. We enrolled 266 patients with anterior wall Q-wave AMI who had >or=3 segments of the infarct zone that were akinetic on echocardiography before discharge. Echocardiographic follow-up was performed 3 months and 1 year after AMI. LV volumes, ejection fraction, wall motion score index, and mitral flow velocities were determined in a blinded analysis at a core echocardiographic laboratory. Acute reperfusion was attempted in 220 patients (83%; primary angioplasty in 29% and thrombolysis in 54%). During hospitalization, 99% of patients underwent coronary angiography and 87% underwent coronary stenting of the infarct-related lesion. At 1 year, 95% of patients received an antiplatelet agent, 89% a beta blocker, 93% an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker, and 93% a statin. Echocardiographic follow-up was obtained in 215 patients. There was recovery in LV systolic function as shown by a decrease in wall motion score index and an increase in ejection fraction. There was a significant increase in end-diastolic volume (EDV; 56.4 +/- 14.7 ml/m2 at baseline, 59.3 +/- 15.7 ml/m2 at 3 months, 62.8 +/- 18.7 ml/m2 at 1 year, p <0.0001). LV remodeling (>20% increase in EDV) was observed in 67 patients (31%). Peak creatine kinase level, systolic blood pressure, and wall motion score index were independently associated with changes in EDV. In conclusion, recent improvements in AMI management do not abolish LV remodeling, which remains a relatively frequent event after an initial anterior wall AMI."
