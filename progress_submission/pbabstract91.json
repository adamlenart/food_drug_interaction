    "0": "Recent large scale antihypertensive treatment trials emphasise the importance of blood pressure control in reducing both cerebrovascular accidents and myocardial infarction. Obviously therefore, the drug that best normalises blood pressure while producing the fewest adverse effects should be sought. On the basis of studies demonstrating cellular membrane and calcium homeostatic derangements and an age-dependent transition of overall cardiovascular regulation and peripheral vasoconstrictor forces during the course of essential hypertension, this review proposes an alternative treatment. Under this treatment scheme angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or beta-blockers should be used in younger patients and in those with high plasma renin activity, while calcium antagonists are used in place of diuretics in older low-renin or Black patients. Age-oriented 2-way drug selection enables a normalisation of blood pressure without untoward effects in about 80% of patients with essential hypertension and helps to optimise drug combinations in those patients who are difficult to treat.", 
    "1": "1. Changes occurring in plasma and tissue angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity have been examined in relation to blood pressure response following acute and chronic administration of N-[N-[[4-(2,3-dihydro-2-benzofuranyl)-1- (ethoxycarbonyl)]-butyl]-(s)-alanyl]-(s)-proline (BRL 36378) and enalapril in the sodium deficient normotensive rat. 2. Both BRL 36378 and enalapril produced a reduction in blood pressure which was evident at 2 and 24 h after acute administration, or at 24 h after chronic (21 days) administration. This was accompanied by inhibition of ACE activity in both plasma and tissues. 3. The magnitude of ACE inhibition was greater following enalapril administration than achieved after BRL 36378 treatment; this was reflected by the greater fall in blood pressure evoked by enalapril. 4. Removal of the respective ACE inhibitors revealed an apparent increase in total enzyme in the plasma of animals dosed chronically with BRL 36378 and enalapril. The onset of this increase in total enzyme was rapid, as it was apparent in plasma at 24 h after a single oral dose of BRL 36378 and enalapril. 5. The increase in total enzyme in plasma may be related to the degree of ACE inhibition, since the increase in total enzyme was of greater magnitude after 21 days treatment with enalapril than following corresponding dosing with BRL 36378. 6. No consistent effects on total enzyme were observed in tissues following acute and chronic administration with the ACE inhibitors. 7. Stimulation of drinking behaviour was observed throughout the periods of chronic (7 and 21 days) administration with both BRL 36378 and enalapril.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "2": "1. The dose-peak effect relationship of lisinopril was evaluated in a double-blind, parallel study in 83 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension (supine diastolic blood pressure = 95-115 mm Hg). 2. After a 4 week placebo washout, patients were randomly assigned to one of four treatments: lisinopril 2.5, 10, 20 or 80 mg day-1 for 1 week. 3. Lisinopril 10 and 20 mg day-1 produced similar peak antihypertensive effects which were greater than that produced by 2.5 mg day-1, but less than that of 80 mg day-1. If the incidence of first-dose symptomatic hypotension is related to the peak effect, then an initial lisinopril dose of 20 mg should not pose any greater risk than a 10 mg dose. 4. The magnitude of antihypertensive response at 24 h postdrug appeared to be dose related across the 2.5 to 80 mg day-1 range.", 
    "3": "Lisinopril is a new, nonsulfhydryl angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor approved for the treatment of hypertension. After oral administration, 25-29 percent of the dose is absorbed intact; biotransformation is not required for pharmacological activity. Onset of action occurs one to two hours after administration, with effects still present 24 hours later. The major route of elimination is through renal excretion and an elimination half-life of 12.6 hours has been reported in normotensive individuals. In patients with impaired renal function (creatinine clearance less than or equal to 30 ml/min) a longer half-life and accumulation have been observed. Lisinopril 20-80 mg/d has been shown to be as effective as hydrochlorothiazide, nifedipine, and beta-blocking agents in the treatment of essential hypertension. Its efficacy in renovascular hypertension has also been demonstrated. In congestive heart failure (CHF) doses of 2.5-20 mg/d appear to provide hemodynamic effects comparable to those of captopril. Dizziness and cough have been the most frequently reported side effects; rash and proteinuria have also been reported in a small number of patients. Interactions with diuretics, potassium supplements, and possibly with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents may occur. Lisinopril appears to be similar in efficacy to other antihypertensive agents in the treatment of essential hypertension and to captopril in the treatment of CHF. Whether lisinopril is safer or more effective than captopril or enalapril in the treatment of hypertension or CHF requires further investigation. Prolonged duration of action of lisinopril allows once daily dosing, unlike captopril for which dosing is required every 8-12 hours or enalapril which may necessitate twice daily dosing.", 
    "4": "The effects of enalapril treatment on blood glucose, insulin, and C-peptide levels and effects on the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system were studied in 22 hypertensive patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes. After a 4-wk run-in period during which all previous antihypertensive drugs were discontinued, treatment was commenced with one daily dose of 10 mg enalapril. The dose was adjusted upward at 3-wk intervals to a maximum of 40 mg daily. In 3 subjects, addition of a thiazide diuretic was required after 9 wk of treatment. At completion of run-in and after 9 and 13 wk of treatment, subjects had blood samples drawn after fasting and 2 h after a standardized 1.6-mJ mixed meal. Mean fasting blood glucose at the end of the run-in period was 8.3 +/- 0.5 mM and at study completion was 7.3 +/- 0.4 mM. Mean postprandial blood glucose was 10.8 +/- 1.0 mM before treatment and 9.8 +/- 0.7 mM at study completion. The changes in fasting and postprandial blood glucose levels were not significant (P = .06 and P = .15, respectively). There was no significant change in glycosylated hemoglobin levels. Fasting and meal-stimulated insulin and C-peptide levels were not altered by enalapril treatment. Treatment was associated with a sustained reduction in plasma angiotensin-converting enzyme activity, an increase in plasma renin activity, reduced plasma aldosterone levels, and significant reductions in supine, seated, and standing arterial blood pressures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "5": "The simultaneous acute effects of converting enzyme inhibition by intravenous enalaprilat on the circulating renin-angiotensin system and on the brachial artery were studied in 12 hypertensive patients by a double-blind comparison with saline effects in 14 hypertensive patients. The brachial artery was investigated in terms of arterial section (measured by pulsed Doppler technique) and wall rigidity (assessed by pulse wave velocity). Arterial and biochemical parameters were measured in baseline before injection and at 20 to 40 minutes (t1) and 80 to 100 minutes (t2) after saline and drug injections. Compared with the saline vehicle, enalaprilat significantly decreased angiotensin enzyme converting activity (p less than 0.001), increased plasma renin activity (p less than 0.01) and decreased plasma aldosterone concentrations (p less than 0.01). The drug reduced blood pressure (p less than 0.01) and increased the brachial artery section (p less than 0.01), but did not change pulse wave velocity. In the enalaprilat group, significant postinjection relations were observed between: (1) enalaprilat concentration and plasma angiotensin converting enzyme activity (r = -0.72, p less than 0.001); (2) plasma renin activity and mean blood pressure (r = -0.46, p less than 0.02); (3) plasma enalaprilat concentration and pulse wave velocity (r = -0.50, p less than 0.01) and (4) pulse wave velocity and brachial artery section (r = 0.42, p less than 0.05). Thus, the brachial artery effects of enalaprilat were not directly related to the blockade of the renin-angiotensin system in plasma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "6": "Cilazapril is a new inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme which has been shown to prevent development of high blood pressure and cardiac hypertrophy in spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) rats. The goal of the present experiment was to evaluate the effects of a chronic treatment with cilazapril on the decrease of coronary reserve in SHR rats. For this purpose, a group of 10 SHR rats which received by oral gavage 10 mg/kg/day of cilazapril for 9 weeks was compared with a control group of 9 SHR rats which received distilled water. Coronary reserve was evaluated by measuring coronary blood flow with the radioactive microspheres method before and after a dose of dipyridamole (2 mg/kg/min) which induces maximal coronary vasodilation. The left ventricular weight/body weight ratio was decreased in the cilazapril group compared to the placebo-treated group (p less than 0.001). Moreover, minimal coronary vascular resistance of the left ventricle and the right ventricle were 33% and 39%, respectively, lower in the cilazapril group as compared with the control group (p less than 0.01). We conclude that chronic treatment with cilazapril can prevent the development of left ventricular hypertrophy and the decrease of coronary vascular reserve in the left and right ventricles of spontaneously hypertensive rats.", 
    "7": "The roles of vasopressin and angiotensin II in the regulation of peripheral vascular tone were investigated in control rats and in rats with chronic (15 weeks) aortic stenosis, by intravenous application of a specific antagonist to the vascular receptors of vasopressin and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor teprotide. The application of a Silver clip (0.6 mm) on the aorta ascendens produced a hemodynamically effective aortic stenosis with an increase in left ventricular weight (38%), a reduction in mean arterial pressure, cardiac index, and stroke volume index, and an increase in peripheral vascular resistance. In both groups of rats, a bolus injection of 30 micrograms of the vasopressin inhibitor d (CH2) 5 Tyr (Me) arginine vasopressin (AVP) showed an agonistic effect by increasing arterial pressure by 11 and 15 mm Hg, respectively, and no antagonistic effect in the control animals. In the rats with chronic aortic stenosis we observed a significant fall in blood pressure (4.1 +/- 5.5 mm Hg; p less than 0.05) and a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance of 6.3% (p less than 0.02). Stroke volume index and heart rate did not change. Most of the animals with aortic stenosis had inappropriately elevated plasma levels of vasopressin and increased levels of plasma renin concentration. The rats with aortic stenosis and inappropriately increased values of vasopressin showed significantly lower plasma osmolality, cardiac index, and stroke volume index and increased peripheral vascular resistance compared with the stenosed rats with a normal osmoregulation of vasopressin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "8": "Vasodilators currently prescribed in the treatment of congestive heart failure represent a wide class of drugs. In acute heart failure, the therapeutic choice should be based on considerations about the mechanisms of drug action as well as the site of action on the vascular bed, together with the patient's hemodynamic and clinical characteristics. For medium-to long-term treatment the choice should be oriented towards drugs which do not activate compensatory or feedback regulation mechanisms. Use of therapeutic agents such as inhibitors of the angiotensin converting enzyme will avoid the development of physiological tolerance.", 
    "9": "We analyzed the transport of angiotensin-converting enzyme (kininase II, EC 3.4.15.1) in the striatonigral pathway by quantitative autoradiography using the specific converting enzyme inhibitor, 125I-351A. 125I-351A binding was studied at different time intervals after knife cut lesions of the striatonigral pathway. Twenty-four h after the lesion, accumulations of 125I-351A binding sites were observed both rostral and caudal to the lesioned site. No change in 125I-351A binding was observed at this time in the caudate putamen and substantia nigra. Ten days after the lesion, a significant decrease (58%) in 125I-351A binding was found in the pars reticulata of the ipsilateral substantia nigra. These results suggest that the angiotensin-converting enzyme is transported axonally in the rat striatonigral pathway.", 
    "10": "The advent of vasodilator therapy and new cardiotonic agents has modified the medical treatment of heart failure. First-line treatment is no longer standard; its choice must take into account a number of individual factors such as patient's age, causative cardiopathy, severity of the disease, response to treatment, contra-indications and side-effects of drugs. The aim is to obtain an improvement not only in the patient's comfort but also in long-term prognosis. The prescription of digitalis compounds to heart failure patients with sinus rhythm has been questioned. Alternatives to the conventional therapeutic approach based on cardiac glycosides and diuretics are now available. They include the use at an early stage of vasodilator therapy, and notably angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, in the hope of avoiding gradual reduction of cardiac performance.", 
    "11": "Several notifications of eye pain and blurred vision associated with treatment with nifedipine were received by New Zealand's Intensive Medicines Monitoring Programme. A questionnaire survey of patients taking nifedipine was undertaken to test the importance of these associations, with disturbance of taste associated with captopril taken as a methodological control. Altogether 961 patients taking nifedipine and 368 taking captopril were sent a questionnaire that asked whether any eye problems and changes in the sense of taste had occurred while they were taking the drug and whether these had resolved after treatment was stopped. Compliance was high: of 922 and 343 questionnaires that were assumed to have been delivered to patients taking nifedipine and captopril, respectively, 770 (84%) and 295 (86%) were returned satisfactorily completed. The distribution of sex was comparable in the two groups; patients taking captopril were slightly younger. Eye symptoms were reported in both groups, but eye pain was significantly more common in patients taking nifedipine (107 (14%) compared with 26 (9%) patients taking captopril). This is a new finding and may be related to ocular vasodilatation. Theoretically, glaucoma is a possible adverse reaction. Loss of taste was significantly associated with captopril, but no other disturbances of taste showed significant associations. Loss of taste persisted in 27 out of 35 patients who continued to take captopril and in three out of eight patients when the drug was withdrawn. This study showed a method of assessing early signs of adverse drug reactions, which has been used once before and identified previously unrecognised reactions.", 
    "12": "About one third of patients receiving dialysis for end stage renal failure have chronic fluid overload despite advice to restrict their oral fluid intake. To investigate the potential of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor in reducing the urge to drink and consequent gain in weight, a double blind, placebo controlled crossover trial of enalapril was conducted in 25 patients receiving dialysis who had fluid overload. The trial comprised a baseline period of four weeks; two periods of treatment, each of four weeks, during which patients received either placebo or enalapril 5 mg twice each week; and a follow up period of four weeks. Five patients withdrew from the trial, one because of an adverse drug reaction to enalapril. A range of biochemical and behavioural variables was measured during the baseline period, at the completion of periods 1 and 2, and during follow up. These variables included gain in weight between dialysis sessions; blood pressure; plasma concentrations of sodium, angiotensin II, and vasopressin; plasma renin and angiotensin converting enzyme activities; osmolality; and estimations of thirst, intake of fluid, and control of drinking. Enalapril caused a significant reduction in gain in weight between dialysis sessions, thirst, and oral intake of fluid in parallel with significantly increased renin activity, significantly decreased angiotensin converting enzyme activity, and decreased concentrations of angiotensin II. Gain in weight and angiotensin converting enzyme activity returned to baseline values once patients stopped taking enalapril. These results suggest that enalapril may act on the renin-angiotensin system and reduce intake of fluid by inhibiting angiotensin converting enzyme.", 
    "13": "Evidence is accumulating that demonstrates the presence of local renin-angiotensin systems, in addition to the established circulating renin-angiotensin system. Renin-like substances, immunoreactive angiotensins, and angiotensin II receptors have been identified throughout the vasculature. Local tissue concentrations of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, rather than serum concentrations, may be more important in determining the magnitude and duration of the long-term cardiac and vascular response to this group of drugs. Certain structural and chemical properties of the ACE inhibitors may provide unique effects at various tissue sites.", 
    "14": "Because the kidney is both the source of circulating renin and the final determinant of the state of sodium balance, which in turn defines responsiveness to angiotensin II, one might have anticipated substantial interest in the impact of converting enzyme inhibitors on the kidney when these agents were developed. The lessons learned about the role of the renin-angiotensin system in normal renal perfusion and function, and possible disorders of control that contribute to disease in patients with essential hypertension, renovascular hypertension, and chronic progressive renal parenchymal disease are reviewed. In each case, the lessons here have important implications for the clinical application of converting enzyme inhibition.", 
    "15": "Although the underlying pathophysiology in most patients with congestive heart failure is impaired myocardial contractility, hemodynamic and clinical benefit can be achieved by treatment with agents that alter the loading conditions of the left ventricle. This was initially accomplished with direct-acting vasodilators such as sodium nitroprusside, nitrates, and hydralazine. Subsequently, the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been demonstrated to produce similar short-term hemodynamic improvement and have generally proved superior in their long-term hemodynamic and clinical efficacy. Although the ACE inhibitors were initially employed as adjunctive treatment in patients with refractory heart failure, recent studies indicate that they are also effective in patients with mild and moderate symptoms and that they are at least as effective as digitalis in this patient group. Furthermore, a growing body of data indicates that the ACE inhibitors improve the survival rate in patients with severe and, possibly, milder heart failure. As a result, the ACE inhibitors have emerged as useful agents in patients with mild symptoms and are being investigated for their potential to improve the survival rate and prevent clinical deterioration in patients with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic left ventricular dysfunction.", 
    "16": "The benefit of treatment of mild to moderate hypertension is minimal over the short term. Hence, sustained control of high blood pressure over many years is required. Under these circumstances, the adverse effects of conventional antihypertensive therapy with diuretics and beta-blockers assume great importance, especially hypokalemia and alterations in blood lipid levels. These metabolic changes can negate the benefit of lowered blood pressure. The adverse effects of antihypertensive drugs, especially on the quality of life of hypertensive patients, have recently received a great deal of attention. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are free of these adverse effects and may actually enhance the quality of life. They are effective antihypertensive agents when given in low doses, they can often be given once a day, and they are effective in all age groups. Combined with a diuretic they are effective in black and elderly hypertensive patients.", 
    "17": "When captopril was first introduced, it was used in high doses for severe hypertension, often in the presence of renal insufficiency, and side effects such as proteinuria, rash, neutropenia, and altered taste sensation were noted. Upon analysis, these effects were most commonly seen in patients with renal disease, autoimmune disease, or collagen vascular disease. These complications usually reversed rapidly upon discontinuation of treatment. In contrast, the growing use of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, captopril and enalapril, for treating mild to moderate hypertension and the trend toward the use of lower doses has shown these agents to be well tolerated with a low frequency of troublesome adverse effects. In fact, the original spectrum of adverse effects has virtually disappeared with the use of lower doses in patients with uncomplicated hypertension. In low doses, the converting enzyme inhibitors produce remarkably few incidences of symptomatic discomfort; the most common is skin rash, which often responds to dosage reduction. Cough and rare occurrences of angioedema have also been reported. Moreover, evidence is evolving that indicates that the converting enzyme inhibitors may sometimes decrease proteinuria and improve renal function; these effects may be especially important in diabetic hypertensive patients. Of note, these drugs can also attenuate the unwanted metabolic side effects of concurrent diuretic treatment.", 
    "18": "Atrial natriuretic peptide is rapidly degraded by a soluble, heat labile peptidase isolated from ventricular myocytes. Degradation of [125I]-ANP is antagonized by unlabelled ANP, bradykinin, glucagon, 1,10-phenanthroline, PCMB, EDTA and the bacterial antibiotic bacitracin, but not by phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride, aprotinin, phosphoramidon, E-64, amastatin or the ACE inhibitor SQ 20881 and bradykinin potentiator C. In addition neither bovine serum albumin nor caesin afforded any protection against degradation. Peptidase activity was optimal at pH values above 8.5. The peptidase is likely to be of intracellular origin and may contribute to the extensive ANP degradative activity found in various ventricular muscle preparations.", 
    "19": "Reduction of elevated blood pressure is effective in reducing morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease in general. Striking decreases in stroke, congestive heart failure, and renal impairment have been observed when blood pressure is reduced. However, the ability of traditional, diuretic-first, stepped-care therapeutic algorithms to reduce the occurrence of myocardial infarction or angina has been exceedingly difficult to demonstrate. An increased frequency of sudden death among hypertensive men with electrocardiographic abnormalities has been observed in some diuretic-based treatment trials. The failure of conventional therapy to reduce coronary artery disease and death has forced a re-appraisal of antihypertensive treatment. The risk factors for coronary disease are reviewed in detail with an emphasis on the impact of various classes of antihypertensive drugs on these factors. The emergence of effective antihypertensive agents that lower blood pressure without adversely affecting cardiovascular risk factors provides a new opportunity to further extend the benefit of treatment by reducing such risk.", 
    "20": "We studied the effects of chronic treatment with a novel angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, alpha-[(2S,6R)-6-[(1S)-1-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl]amino-5-oxo-2- (2-thienyl)perhydro-1,4-thiazepin-4-yl]acetic acid.HCl (CS622), and a vasodilator, hydralazine, on plasma atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) levels and kidney ANF receptors in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Plasma ANF level was decreased and cardiac hypertrophy reduced in CS622 treated SHR, but not in hydralazine treated SHR, although blood pressure was lowered similarly in both SHR groups. The binding capacity of kidney ANF receptors increased and the affinity decreased in CS622 treated SHR compared to untreated SHR. These results suggest that decrease of plasma ANF results from decreased cardiac load but not from lowered blood pressure, and that changes in ANF receptors result from increased plasma ANF.", 
    "21": "Extensive research has focused on the mechanisms by which converting enzyme inhibitors, such as captopril, lower the systemic blood pressure. In addition to inhibiting the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, these agents have been proposed to influence other systems which might affect vascular resistance including the kinins and the prostanoids. This study was designed to evaluate whether captopril has any direct effect to increase the synthesis of endogenous vasodilator prostanoids in either freshly isolated rabbit renal preglomerular microvessels or in endothelial cells derived from them. The results indicate that captopril, in a variety of doses, had no effect on the synthesis of either prostacyclin or PGE2 by renal preglomerular microvessels. Bradykinin, on the other hand, increased prostanoid production significantly in the same tissue preparations. Finally, captopril had no effect in altering bradykinin-induced increases in renovascular prostanoid biosynthesis. Thus, captopril appears to have no ability to enhance the production of vasodilator prostanoids in rabbit renal preglomerular resistance vessels. These data question the role of prostanoid-related mechanisms in the non-renin-related antihypertensive actions of captopril.", 
    "22": "The diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of ACE inhibitors in patients with various forms of hypertension are discussed. The immediate blood pressure reduction after administration of an ACE inhibitor is significantly more marked in patients with renovascular than with essential hypertension. However, analysis of the individual blood pressure response after captopril does not allow a clear distinction between these two forms of hypertension. In patients with moderate hypertension the reduction of blood pressure with ACE inhibitors is similar to that with betablockers. Their use as a first step agent in moderate hypertension, however, is limited to selected patients. In severe drug-resistant hypertension treatment with ACE inhibitors is well established. Cases with renovascular hypertension may suffer a deterioration of renal function under ACE inhibitors. Other side effects are uncommon where renal function is normal or where the dose is adapted to the decreased glomerular filtration rate.", 
    "23": "In ten patients with angiographically demonstrated coronary heart disease exercise electrocardiograms were recorded before as well as two and four hours after administration of 5 or 10 mg Quinapril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI). This reduced the sum of ST-segment depressions from 16.3 to 11.6 mV (P less than 0.001). While the heart rate remained unchanged, blood pressure fell from 147/91 to 119/79 mm Hg and the angina-free exercise time was clearly prolonged. Altogether there was a reduction of the ischaemia reaction by 35%. This perhaps speaks for an anti-anginal effect of ACEI, which could be of importance in the management of both hypertension and heart failure. In addition, the ACE inhibitors might be used as anti-angina drugs.", 
    "24": "The hypotensive effect of captopril was assessed in patients with essential hypertension. Captopril-induced fall in arterial blood pressure was shown to be due to a decrease in total peripheral resistance. Treatment with captopril improved considerably physical stress tolerance, its combinations with a diuretic agent being particularly effective.", 
    "25": "Captopril, the first orally active inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme, is used widely in the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure. The pharmacokinetics of this agent have been studied extensively in healthy subjects and in patients with hypertension, congestive heart failure, and chronic renal failure. Captopril contains a sulphydryl group and binds readily to albumin and other plasma proteins. The drug also forms mixed disulphides with endogenous thiol-containing compounds (cysteine, glutathione), as well as the disulphide dimer of the parent compound. These components in blood and urine are measured collectively as total captopril. Because of the reversibility of the formation of these inactive disulphides, total captopril may serve as a reservoir of the pharmacologically active moiety, and thus contribute to a duration of action longer than that predicted by blood concentrations of unchanged captopril. To measure free or unchanged captopril concentrations, a chemical stabiliser must be added to the biological samples to prevent the formation of captopril disulphides ex vivo. In healthy subjects given captopril intravenously, the body clearance of captopril and steady-state volume of distribution were about 0.7 L/h/kg and 0.8 L/kg, respectively. The elimination half-life of unchanged captopril was approximately 2 hours. The primary route of elimination of captopril is the kidney. The renal clearance of unchanged captopril exceeds the glomerular filtration rate, due to active tubular secretion of the drug. In healthy subjects, about 70 to 75% of an oral dose is absorbed and the bioavailability of captopril is approximately 65%. Peak blood concentrations are reached about 45 to 60 minutes after oral administration. The bioavailability of captopril is not altered by age or concomitant medications including diuretics, procainamide, allopurinol, cimetidine or digoxin. However, the co-administration of food or antacids, or probenecid with captopril has been shown to diminish the bioavailability of the latter and decrease its clearance, respectively. The decreased bioavailability of captopril when taken with meals does not significantly alter clinical responses to the drug. Over a wide range of oral (10 to 150 mg) and intravenous doses (2.5 to 10 mg) captopril had linear kinetics in healthy volunteers. In healthy subjects with normal renal function and patients with congestive heart failure given captopril 3 times daily, blood concentrations of total captopril accumulated, whereas those of unchanged captopril did not. Severe renal insufficiency was associated with an accumulation of both unchanged and total captopril.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "26": "The crude rat and bovine synaptosomal lysate from brain can hydrolyze angiotensin I (AI) to des-Leu angiotensin I (AI-dL) and no further. This cytosolic enzyme has a specificity for angiotensin-related sequences, R-His-Pro-Phe-His-Leu and therefore named angiotensin-related carboxypeptidase (ARC). These studies led to the biosynthesis and purification of AI-dL in order to determine if it can provoke a drinking response. This nonapeptide is a potent dipsogen when injected into the cerebroventricles of rats. The drinking response probably requires a second hydrolysis to angiotensin II (AII) since both captopril and saralasin can inhibit this response.", 
    "27": "Captopril was used in 20 infants aged less than 1 year with heart failure secondary to defects with predominantly a left to right shunt that was poorly controlled with digoxin and diuretics. Total daily dose of captopril ranged from 0.88 to 2.5 mg/kg (mean 1.3 mg/kg) in three divided doses. Improvement in the control of heart failure was seen mainly as an increase in the rate of weight gain from a mean of 48 g/week before treatment to 102 g/week on treatment and a decrease in the mean respiratory rate from 68 breaths/minute to 60 breaths/minute. Side effects were seen in four patients--two with asymptomatic mild hypotension, one with renal insufficiency which improved with a reduction in dose, and one with severe oliguria progressing to renal failure. Significant changes in plasma electrolyte concentration did not occur except in the infant who developed acute renal failure.", 
    "28": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are being used increasingly as initial therapy in the management of mild to moderate hypertension. As monotherapy, ACE inhibitors are effective in lowering blood pressure in over 50 percent of patients. When a combination of an ACE inhibitor and a diuretic is used, 80 to 95 percent of patients respond. The adverse metabolic effects associated with diuretics and beta blockers do not occur with ACE inhibitors.", 
    "29": "The effects of captopril, methyldopa, and propranolol hydrochloride on reported distress over sexual symptoms over a 24-week treatment period were examined as part of a multicenter, randomized, double-blind clinical trial in which 626 men with mild to moderate hypertension participated. On entry into the clinical trial, 58% of patients taking antihypertensive medications and 44% of men not receiving antihypertensive drugs reported distress over one or more sexual symptoms. Among 304 patients treated with monotherapy who completed the trial, total symptoms distress scores of treatment groups did not differ from each other in change from baseline to week 24, but in particular, problems of maintaining an erection were significantly worsened with propranolol therapy. Among 177 patients treated with monotherapy plus a diuretic, total sexual symptoms distress scores worsened among the groups taking methyldopa or propranolol, with significant worsening in all individual symptoms among patients taking propranolol, and problems in maintaining an erection and in ejaculation among patients receiving methyldopa. Among patients treated with captopril plus a diuretic, no change from baseline appeared in scores for any of the sexual symptoms. The findings underline the importance of taking an adequate sexual history and document that selection of antihypertensive drugs may significantly affect the incidence of sexual symptoms.", 
    "30": "In young anesthetized Munich-Wistar rats, red cell flux (Qrbc) was measured in the vasa recta of the exposed renal papilla by means of fluorescently labeled erythrocytes. To study the vasoreactivity of the juxtamedullary vasculature and its sensitivity to converting-enzyme inhibition, measurements of Qrbc were made before and after continuous intravenous infusion of the angiotensin I converting-enzyme inhibitor captopril (3 mg.h-1.kg body wt-1). A time control group that received vehicle alone was studied in parallel. Captopril acts as a vasodilator and reduces systemic arterial pressure. Captopril treatment increased Qrbc by 40 +/- 4% (n = 9, P less than 0.001) and decreased blood pressure by 9% (P less than 0.001). In the time control group no statistically significant change occurred in either Qrbc (+6 +/- 8%, n = 10) or blood pressure (-1%). Urine samples were taken from the papillary tip. In neither of the groups did the urine osmolality show a statistically significant change. In the time control group the values before and after intravenous infusion were 1,006 +/- 61 and 1,091 +/- 70 mosmol/kg H2O, respectively, and in the captopril-treated animals the corresponding values were 1,150 +/- 85 and 1,210 +/- 60 mosmol/kg H2O, respectively. These results confirm the suggestion that there is high vasoreactivity in the juxtamedullary vasculature and that this region is sensitive to inhibition of angiotensin I-converting enzyme, the latter sensitivity implying that angiotensin II plays a role in the regulation of juxtamedullary vascular resistance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "31": "In Goldblatt hypertension in rats produced by implanting a silver clip on the left renal artery, captopril induces a greater difference in the 1-min uptake of diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) between the two kidneys than in baseline uptakes, similar to the experiences in unilateral renovascular hypertension in man. The combination of captopril and furosemide induces an even greater difference in renal uptakes than with captopril alone in this rat model. In paired experiments, DTPA complexes were used as a standard to compare the differences in renal uptake between the two kidneys after captopril-furosemide with other existing and potential renal radiodiagnostic agents. No statistically significant difference was found between DTPA, glucoheptonate, dimercaptosuccinic acid, aminated dextran, or lysozyme. However, the differences in renal uptake were significantly less with hippuran than with DTPA. Furosemide and captopril caused delayed renal retention of hippuran after one minute. This response appeared to be due to non-specific volume depletion because it occurred in both clipped and unclipped kidneys.", 
    "32": "Captopril microcapsules were prepared with different viscosity grades of ethyl cellulose by temperature induced coacervation from cyclohexane. Both non-ionic surfactants or their combinations and 2 per cent absolute alcohol as cosolvent were added to the coacervation system to ensure complete solvation of the ethyl cellulose and efficient microencapsulation of the drug. The in vitro dissolution was studied in 0.1 N hydrochloric acid. Microcapsules prepared using 2 per cent Tween 80 with ethyl cellulose of 41 c.p. viscosity grade exhibited the most prolonged release with a t70 per cent of 55 min in comparison to 7.75 min for control microcapsules prepared without surfactant. Different kinetic models have been used to explain the release. The best fit with the highest correlation coefficients was the first-order kinetics plot with two straight lines having two different slopes. The initial slope presents the faster release rate than the terminal slope. This fast release would be useful for the initial dose of the prolonged release formulation.", 
    "33": "Once initiated, renal disease progresses in most patients to end-stage over a matter of months or years. This progressive consumption of renal mass seems to result from maladaptations to the initial insult by the remaining kidney. This review stresses the hemodynamic underpinnings of this progression of renal disease. The evidence is reviewed that indicates that loss of renal mass from surgical reduction in kidney tissue or from diabetes mellitus results in increased blood flow, filtration, and glomerular pressure in the remaining nephrons. Prevention of this glomerular hypertension by reduction in dietary protein or by the addition of converting enzyme inhibitors affords protection. The clinical implications of these observations are reviewed.", 
    "34": "1. Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) levels were positively correlated with plasma renin activity (PRA) levels, when blood volume and blood pressure (BP) were not raised in normal subjects (NLS) or patients with postoperative aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA), Bartter's syndrome (BS), Addison's disease, anorexia nervosa, diuretic abuse or salt-losing congenital adrenal hyperplasia. 2. Angiotensin II infusion raised ANP levels in NLS, and patients with BS, pre- and postoperative APA, only when BP rose, suggesting that this effect might be mediated by the rise in BP. 3. Captopril lowered aldosterone and ANP levels in renal artery stenosis, but falling BP levels could mediate this effect. Captopril lowered aldosterone and BP in BS, but did not lower ANP, perhaps because angiotensin remained elevated. 4. Indomethacin lowered ANP when PRA was initially normal or raised (NLS and BS), but not when PRA was suppressed (APA). This effect could not be mediated by BP, which rose, but could be mediated by renin-angiotensin, which fell. 5. Factors other than central blood volume and atrial stretch may modulate ANP levels. Plasma angiotensin II may be such a factor, and may exert an important influence at high levels, especially when blood volume is low.", 
    "35": "Percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA) was performed in 28 hypertensive patients with 50% or more unilateral renal artery stenosis. Prospectively, the study compared the extent to which systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) pressure during long-term converting-enzyme inhibition (CEI) and the ipsi- to contralateral renal vein renin ratio (RVR) predicted success of PTRA, defined as SBP less than 160 mmHg and DBP less than 95 mmHg. Both SBP and DBP after PTRA were positively correlated with pressure during CEI (P less than 0.001) and negatively with RVR (P less than 0.03). In multiple regression these associations were independent and remained statistically significant. In discriminant analysis, a SBP during CEI less than 160 mmHg, a DBP during CEI less than 95 mmHg, and a RVR greater than or equal to 1.5 identified with equal accuracy the success of PTRA. Furthermore, in patients with a SBP during CEI less than 160 mmHg, the demonstration of a RVR greater than or equal to 1.5 increased (P less than 0.05) the prediction of a positive outcome from 50 to 67%. In contrast, in 92% of the patients with a SBP during CEI greater than 160 mmHg, PTRA was not successful. Thus, blood pressure measurements during long-term CEI predict the curability by PTRA of renovascular hypertension and can be employed either alone or in association with the RVR.", 
    "36": "Hypertension associated with a reduction in renal mass has been traditionally thought of as a volume-dependent state. Recent investigations suggest important roles for systemic and glomerular resistance vessels in the pathogenesis of systemic hypertension (SHT) and progression of end-stage renal disease. To examine this relationship, investigations were performed in two groups of rats maintained for 6 weeks following 5/6 renal ablation. Group A received converting enzyme inhibition (CEI) for 6 weeks. Group B received no treatment. Systolic blood pressure and weight of remnant kidney tissue were both increased in group B (P less than 0.01). BUN did not differ in groups A and B; however, renal PGI2 excretion was increased in group A (P less than 0.01). Renal morphology was preserved in group A, with little or no evidence of glomerular sclerosis. CEI prevents SHT and enhances renal PGI2 excretion in this model. The selective increase in PGI2 may mediate systemic and renal effects of this agent.", 
    "37": "Experimental uremia is known to cause cardiac hypertrophy. In the present study we examined the effect of uremia with or without concomitant treatment of hypertension by the converting enzyme Ramipril (125 micrograms/day) on micromorphometric indices of cardiac interstitium at the light microscopical and ultrastructural level. In male SD rats, 21 days of uremia caused an increase of total heart weight (1040 +/- 73 mg wet wt vs. 871 +/- 81 in controls, P less than 0.05) with an increase of both right and left ventricular weight. This was accompanied by reduction of capillary cross-sectional area despite unchanged capillary length. The volume density (cm3/cm3) of cardiomyocytes was unchanged (0.881 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.871 +/- 0.016 in controls), but volume density of interstitial tissue (excluding capillary lumen) was significantly increased (0.042 +/- 0.011 cm3 interstitial tissue/cm3 total heart tissue vs. 0.019 +/- 0.007 in controls). This was associated with signs of activation of interstitial cells, that is, increased volume of interstitial cell nuclei and interstitial cell cytoplasm. Concomitantly, a significant increase of volume density of non-cellular interstitial ground substance was found which was not normalized by antihypertensive treatment using Ramipril. After three months of uremia, electron microscopy showed collagen fiber deposition in the interstitium. Comparable interstitial fibrosis was not observed in hearts of rats with renovascular (one clip-two kidney) hypertension. It is concluded that uremia increases myocardial interstitial ground substance by mechanisms independent of hypertension. The data may be relevant for recent findings of diastolic heart malfunction secondary to impaired compliance in uremic patients.", 
    "38": "1. The antihypertensive and renal effects of cilazapril, a new angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, were evaluated in both two-kidney, one-clip Goldblatt hypertensive rats (n = 11) and normotensive rats (n = 6). 2. Intravenous infusion of cilazapril (1 mg/kg followed by 25 micrograms min-1 kg-1) caused significant reductions of blood pressure from 163 +/- 3 to 122 +/- 4 mmHg and from 157 +/- 2 to 113 +/- 3 mmHg in two separate groups of hypertensive rats and from 124 +/- 1 to 105 +/- 2 mmHg in normotensive rats. The hypotensive effect in terms of absolute value of percentage change was greater in hypertensive rats than in normotensive rats (41 +/- 6 vs 20 +/- 3 mmHg or 25 +/- 4% vs 16 +/- 2%, respectively). 3. Cilazapril increased glomerular filtration rate, urine flow, and absolute and fractional excretion rates of sodium and potassium in the non-clipped kidney of hypertensive rats. In contrast, the clipped kidney exhibited a depressed renal function during cilazapril infusion. 4. In normotensive rats, the hypotensive and enhanced renal function responses to cilazapril were much less than those of the non-clipped kidney of hypertensive rats. 5. Superimposed administration of either angiotensin II or angiotensin III during cilazapril infusion completely reversed the blood pressure and bilateral renal responses of cilazapril in both hypertensive and normotensive rats. 6. These results indicate that cilazapril reduces arterial pressure and enhances renal excretion mainly via inhibition of angiotensin II and angiotensin III formation.", 
    "39": "To explain how converting enzyme inhibition could improve the prognosis in cardiac insufficiency, the effect of converting enzyme inhibition (CEI) by S9490-3 (Perindopril) treatment for 2 months (treated infarctions, n = 18) on hormonal plasma variables and the quantitative and qualitative changes in myocardium were studied in an experimental model of left ventricular infarction in rats (untreated infarctions, n = 18) and compared to a sham-operated control group (n = 15). Induction of myocardial infarction was associated with a transient decrease in blood pressure. CEI treatment maintained a lower blood pressure throughout the experimental period. Plasma renin concentration was not significantly increased in the untreated infarct group (155.4 +/- 136.7 ng AI/ml/hr) as compared to the sham-operated group (47.6 +/- 15.9 ng AI/ml/hr). Plasma aldosterone did not change in the three experimental groups. The plasma level of immunoreactive atrial natriuretic factor increased in the untreated infarct group (185 +/- 245 pg/ml) as compared with the control group (76 +/- 40 pg/ml) and was normalized by CEI (66 +/- 60 pg/ml). Body weight was slightly decreased in both treated and untreated infarct groups, whereas the heart weight was significantly increased in the untreated group (1,540 +/- 310 mg) and normalized by treatment (1,145 +/- 180 mg) as compared with sham-operated controls (1,071 +/- 80 mg). The combined atria and right ventricular mass was significantly increased in the untreated infarct group (660 +/- 210 mg) and decreased by treatment (443 +/- 106 mg) but was not completely normalized (controls, 343 +/- 40 mg). Left ventricular isomyosin profiles were modified by myocardial infarction as compared with controls: V1 form decreased from 62.4 +/- 9.4% in the sham-operated group to 41.6 +/- 13.4% in the infarct group, and the V3 form increased from 13.0 +/- 4.7% in sham-operated animals to 27.4 +/- 11.8% in untreated infarct animals. CEI treatment partially, but significantly, reversed this modification of the isomyosin profile (V1, 53.0 +/- 14.4%; V3, 17.5 +/- 8.0%). Volume density of collagen was significantly increased in the untreated infarct rats (4.14 +/- 0.81% versus 2.68 +/- 0.49% in controls), and this was reversed by treatment (2.95 +/- 0.66%). Messenger RNA encoding for atrial natriuretic factor, measured by dot blot hybridization, was significantly increased in both the atria and the ventricles in the untreated infarct group, and treatment by CEI partially reversed this increase. Thus, myocardial infarction profoundly modified several variables of peripheral circulation and quantitative and qualitative myocardial protein expression.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "40": "1. Two groups of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were treated with enalapril (25-30 mg/kg per day): Group I received treatment from 4 to 14 weeks of age to inhibit development of hypertension and Group R received the drug from 14 to 20 weeks of age to reverse established hypertension. 2. Systolic blood pressure, ploidy of aortic smooth muscle cells (flow cytometric DNA analysis) and aortic hypertrophy (medial cross-sectional area) were determined at times both during and after enalapril treatment (up to 30 weeks). 3. Enalapril treatment normalized blood pressure to that of age-matched Wistar-Kyoto rats in both groups. Blood pressure rose again following cessation of treatment. 4. In untreated SHR the incidence of polyploid cells increased concomitantly with increasing pressure throughout the time studied, whereas in Group I the incidence remained low. In Group R, the incidence of polyploidy directly paralleled both the decrease (normalization) and the rise in blood pressure following cessation of treatment. 5. Hence, the incidence of vascular smooth muscle cell polyploidy is not simply a result of growth of the vessel with increasing age of the SHR, but parallels inhibition, reversal, and redevelopment of hypertension.", 
    "41": "In 12 patients with mild or moderate essential hypertension we assessed by 2-D pulsed Doppler flowmetry the influence of a 6-month effective treatment with enalapril or atenolol on peripheral hemodynamics. The patients were studied in control conditions, at the end of the 6-month pharmacologic treatment, and 2 weeks after the withdrawal of the therapy. In spite of a comparable fall in blood pressure, the effects of the two drugs on forearm hemodynamics were quite different. Enalapril induced a fall in vascular resistance and an increase in brachial artery diameter, flow, and compliance, while atenolol failed to modify all these parameters. In the enalapril group the improvement in forearm vascular resistance and brachial artery compliance persisted after the 2-week washout period. This latter observation raises the possibility that enalapril may reverse structural changes in the large arteries.",

The biochemical and pharmacological profiles of the novel, orally active angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, N-[N-[[4-(2, 3-dihydro-2-benzofuranyl)-1-(ethoxycarbonyl)]butyl]-(s)-alanyl]- (s)-proline (BRL 36378), have been compared with those of enalapril and captopril. 2. In the conscious sodium deficient spontaneously hypertensive rat, BRL 36378 and enalapril (0.3-10 mg/kg orally) produced comparable falls in blood pressure; at 3 mg/kg orally, captopril was less active than BRL 36378 and enalapril. 3. In the anaesthetised spontaneously hypertensive rat, enalapril was slightly more potent than BRL 36378 as an inhibitor of angiotensin I (AI) pressor responses whilst BRL 36378 was about twice as potent as captopril in this test (i.v. route used). BRL 36378 and enalapril were equipotent as potentiators of bradykinin depressor responses. 4. In the anaesthetised Wistar rat, the maximum inhibition of AI pressor responses by 0.1 microgram/kg i.v. BRL 36378 and captopril was achieved sooner than after the same dose of enalapril. The inhibitory effect of captopril subsided completely by 40-50 min but the maximum effects of BRL 36378 and enalapril persisted for at least 60 min. 5. In the conscious renal hypertensive cat, captopril was slightly more potent than BRL 36378 or enalapril as a blood pressure lowering agent, over 1-10 mg/kg orally. BRL 36378 was more potent than enalapril as an inhibitor of AI induced pressor responses in this model. Captopril possessed similar inhibitory activity to BRL 36378 although minor differences in time course were apparent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "44": "The effect of enalapril in the treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon was assessed in a prospective double-blind cross-over trial in 17 patients (nine primary Raynaud's, eight Raynaud's associated with scleroderma). Each patient received 20 mg enalapril daily and placebo for 3 weeks with a 2-week washout period in between. The severity and frequency of Raynaud's attacks were measured subjectively by a diary count and objectively by measurement of finger systolic pressure changes in response to cooling (cold challenge test). Enalapril was associated with a reduction in the frequency of Raynaud's attacks, especially in patients with primary Raynaud's, compared with placebo, but there was no effect on the cold challenge test. We conclude that enalapril, like other vasodilator drugs, helps the symptoms of Raynaud's phenomenon, especially in patients with idiopathic or primary disease.",

Dietary protein intake was then increased to 40% in 10 rats (LP-HP) while 11 rats remained on 8.5% protein (LP-LP). Lysozymuria (UlysV) increased from 66.5 +/- 31.0 mcg/day to 457.5 +/- 98.0 mcg/day (P less than 0.001) after five days in LP-HP, but was unchanged in LP-LP. Albuminuria (UalbV) increased only in LP-HP, from 168 +/- 23 mg/day to 447 +/- 45 mg/day (P less than 0.001). Urinary lysozyme excretion correlated with UalbV (r = 0.737, P less than 0.001), and changes in UlysV correlated with changes in UalbV (r = 0.657, P less than 0.01). To determine whether the increase in UlysV was the direct effect of the change in diet, enalapril 40 mg/kg/day was administered to prevent the increase in UalbV that occurs when these rats are fed a high protein diet. Twelve rats were fed 8.5% (LP) and 10 were fed 40% protein (HP) from the time of injection with antiserum. Six LP (LPE) and five HP (HPE) received enalapril.

    "46": "Recent reports of the presence of components of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the mammalian ovary suggest that angiotensin II (Ang II) may be elaborated by this structure. In this study, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), a key enzyme in the synthesis of Ang II, was identified enzymatically and localized to the germinal epithelium surrounding corpora lutea, granulosa cells of some--but not all--follicles, and blood vessels of the rat ovary using a potent and specific radiolabeled ACE inhibitor, 125I-351A. Follicles that bound 125I-351A also contained Ang II-receptor binding sites. Co-localization of RAS components to the follicular granulosa cells and the ability of Ang II to promote estrogen formation suggest that the ovarian RAS may promote follicular development and assertion of dominance.", 
    "47": "The anti-ischemic effect of a single oral dose of 10 mg of enalapril maleate (E) was investigated in 14 normotensive patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and stable effort-induced angina pectoris. An exercise stress test was performed three times in each patient at the same clock hour on three successive days: with no treatment (baseline), 6 h after administration of placebo (P), and 6 h after oral administration of a single 10 mg dose of E. The multistage nonstop effort tests were performed in the sitting position. Workload started at 25 W and was increased by 25 W every 2 min until an ischemic ST depression of more than 1.5 mm was observed. The following parameters were measured: heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (BP), rate-pressure product (RPP), workload sustained (WS), elapsed time of effort (ET), and millimeters of ischemic ST depression. The values of the parameters observed with baseline, P, and E were compared at the moment of appearance of chest pain or ischemic ST depression, at the moment of maximal effort, maximal common WS (MCWS), and maximal common RPP (MCRPP). Enalapril delayed the appearance of the ischemic ST depression. At the MCWS, the RPP was significantly lower under E and the ST depression was less marked; this effect was the result of a lower BP level, in the absence of any significant change in HR response. The acute effects of E observed in normotensive patients with effort-induced angina pectoris seems to be related to the inhibition of angiotensin at the coronary level and to its antiadrenergic action.", 
    "48": "A direct radio-immunoassay (RIA) for renin substrate (RS) was compared to the enzymatic (indirect) assay, which measures intact RS only, whereas a direct assay measures both intact RS and des-angiotensin I-RS. In normal subjects, a significant, albeit weak, correlation between the methods was noticed. In hypertensive patients with different levels of plasma renin activity (PRA), RS concentration measured by both assays increased with increasing PRA, and for patients with PRA greater than 10 micrograms AI/l/h, the direct assay gave significantly higher RS values (55%), compared to the enzymatic assay. This indicates consumption of RS by increasing plasma renin and increasing production rate of RS with increasing PRA, of potential importance in the pathogenesis of hypertension. In 11 patients with renovascular hypertension, treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, lisinopril, resulted in a significant increase in PRA, accompanied by a decrease in RS measured by the enzymatic assay. Lowered plasma RS concentration, by reduction of the velocity of the renin-RS reaction, will distort and invalidate results of PRA determination during treatment with ACE inhibitory compounds. No change in RS measured by direct RIA was noticed, however. The results suggest that ACE inhibition may not have an effect upon RS production and that its effect on plasma RS is limited to a reduction of intact RS measured by the enzymatic assay.", 
    "49": "Glomerular hemodynamics measurements in rats with experimental membranous nephropathy [passive Heymann nephritis (PHN)] have demonstrated that the appearance of proteinuria 5 days after administration of anti-Fx1A antibody is temporally related to changes in the glomerular ultrafiltration coefficient (LpA). Previous studies in other models of glomerular injury have suggested a significant role for angiotensin II (ANG II) in the glomerular hemodynamic abnormalities. To evaluate the possible role of ANG II in the LpA decrease, converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI) was administered acutely or chronically (5 days before and after induction of PHN) to rats with PHN. Acute ANG II blockade produced a fall in mean arterial pressure (MAP), single-nephron glomerular filtration rate (SNGFR), absolute proximal reabsorption (APR), single-nephron plasma flow, single-nephron blood flow, and glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure (PG); however, no changes in LpA were detected. Chronic administration of CEI (MK421, 5 mg.kg-1.day-1) in the drinking water was associated with a fall in MAP; however, both SNGFR and APR increased. PG and the transcapillary hydrostatic pressure gradient were unchanged, and LpA remained depressed. These results suggest that reduction of LpA in rats with PHN is ANG II independent and that other mechanisms are required to explain these changes in glomerular hemodynamics.", 
    "50": "The efficacy of a new angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, lisinopril, used alone (group A) was compared with lisinopril plus hydrochlorothiazide (group B) in 26 patients with essential hypertension. Therapy with both regimens was equally effective in lowering blood pressure compared to placebo. Mean antihypertensive dose of lisinopril was lower when given in combination with hydrochlorothiazide than when given alone (48 +/- 6 vs 68 +/- 12 mg daily). Plasma renin activity increased in both groups of patients, but more in group B (p less than 0.05). Plasma aldosterone concentrations and serum uric acid levels were also higher in the group receiving lisinopril plus hydrochlorothiazide (p less than 0.05). Serum potassium concentrations were unaffected in either group. The incidence of side effects was similar in groups A and B (44% and 38%, respectively). This study suggests that lisinopril alone or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide effectively lowers blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension without any major side effects.",

    "52": "Two intestinal brush border membrane carboxypeptidases were found to participate in the sequential digestion of proline-containing peptides representing a novel mechanism of hydrolysis from the COOH terminus. NH2-blocked prolyl tripeptides were rapidly hydrolyzed by either brush border membrane angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE, dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase, E.C. 3.4.15.1) or carboxypeptidase P (E.C.3.4.12-) depending on the position of the proline residue. Furthermore, these two enzymes were found to participate in a concerted manner to sequentially degrade larger proline-containing pentapeptides from the COOH terminus. A brush border membrane associated neutral endopeptidase also participated in the hydrolysis of the prolyl pentapeptides. During in vivo intestinal perfusion, the NH2-blocked prolyl peptides were degraded and their constituent amino acids efficiently absorbed by the intestine. Furthermore, hydrolysis and absorption of these peptides could be dramatically suppressed by low concentrations of captopril, a specific inhibitor of ACE. These studies show that prolyl peptides are efficiently and sequentially hydrolyzed from the COOH terminus by the combined action of ACE and carboxypeptidase P, and that these enzymes may play an important role in the digestion and assimilation of proline-containing peptides.", 
    "53": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) has been identified as a prominent brush border membrane-bound enzyme of human jejunum. In this study, we purified brush border membrane vesicles enriched in ACE, and characterized the ACE with regard to (a) its stability in the membrane, (b) substrate hydrolysis kinetics compared with pulmonary endothelial ACE, and (c) pharmacologic interaction with Ramipril. These investigations resulted in the following findings. The uninhibited enzyme is stable in native membranes in vitro, with a half-life of 195 +/- 7 h. Kinetic analysis of ACE hydrolysis activity revealed the presence of a single enzyme species, which yielded a high Vmax and displayed a Km similar to purified ACE from lung endothelium. Brush border ACE was inhibited by Ramipril, one of the most specific and potent orally administered ACE inhibitors indicated for hypertension. We determined the brush border ACE value of IC50 = 3 X 10(-9) M Ramipril-diacid, which is the same value for serum and lung ACE. Brush border ACE remains 100% inhibited by 10 microM Ramipril during at least 8 days in vitro. The data indicate that ACE is a prominent jejunal brush border enzyme that behaves pharmacologically and kinetically like its peripheral circulation counterpart. This study suggests that high doses of orally administered ACE inhibitors may affect intestinal epithelial function.", 
    "54": "In order to determine if the decreased hypothalamic and increased posterior pituitary content of vasopressin (VP) observed previously in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were a secondary consequence of the hypertension, the effect of preventing the development of hypertension on VP content of the hypothalamoneurohypophyseal system was evaluated. Two methods for preventing the hypertension were used: (1) chronic angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (oral captopril, 100 mg/kg/day at 4-12 weeks of age); and (2) intraventricular 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA, 200 micrograms at 4 and 5 weeks of age). Both of these treatments markedly attenuated the increase in systolic blood pressure in SHRs at 5-11 weeks of age. The captopril-treated rats had a significant elevation in serum renin activity at 12 weeks of age indicating the presence of chronic converting enzyme inhibition, and the 6-OHDA-treatment resulted in a depletion of hypothalamic (86%) and brainstem (76%) norepinephrine content. Hypothalamic VP content was reduced in untreated SHRs compared to normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKYs, P = 0.0015). It was not significantly altered in either strain by the 6-OHDA treatment. Captopril caused a reduction in hypothalamic VP content in both SHRs and WKYs (P less than 0.01). Posterior pituitary VP content was elevated in untreated SHRs compared to WKYs (P less than 0.001), and remained elevated with captopril and 6-OHDA treatments. These data indicate that the abnormalities in VP content in the hypothalamus and posterior pituitary of SHRs are not a response to the hypertension. Therefore, they may represent primary abnormalities in the SHR.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The diuretic therapy was furosemide, 40 to 80 mg/day, with or without amiloride, 5 to 10 mg/day. The dose of enalapril was 5 to 20 mg/day. Four hours after the administration of the morning dose of enalapril, a Swan-Ganz catheter was positioned in the pulmonary artery. Patients received increasing doses of IS-5-MN to produce a satisfactory decrease in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. Two of the first 3 patients studied had a large reduction in blood pressure when given 10 mg of IS-5-MN. Subsequent patients were therefore given an initial dose of 5 mg, the total dose being 5 to 20 mg over 2 hours.

    "56": "We have investigated the interaction of ligands in the active site of the angiotensin-converting enzyme from rabbit lung by monitoring the concurrent effects of two inhibitors on enzyme activity. A strong synergism is found in the binding of N-acetyl-L-proline (an analog of the COOH-terminal dipeptide portion of preferred substrates) and acetohydroxamate (a zinc ligand). Analysis of the inhibition data with the Yone-tani-Theorell plot yields an unusually low value of 0.0063 for the interaction constant (alpha). This result indicates that each of the above ligands stimulates the binding of the other by about 150-fold. Similar but often less pronounced synergism is observed for other zinc ligands and with some other N-acyl amino acids. These specific structural requirements suggest that the above effect is associated with an induced-fit mechanism which brings the important zinc atom into a catalytically optimal state only in the presence of certain preferred substrates.", 
    "57": "Trandolapril (RU 44570), a new non-sulfhydryl angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor chemically related to enalapril, and its diacid (RU 44403), were investigated for their ability to inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme. Trandolapril attenuated angiotensin I (Ang I)-induced pressor responses following i.v. administration to rats and dogs with ID50 values of 13.1 +/- 1.3 and 21.1 +/- 2.3 micrograms/kg. RU 44403 produced corresponding values of 9.9 +/- 0.7 and 7.2 +/- 2.3 micrograms/kg. Trandolapril (3-300 micrograms/kg) produced a dose-related attenuation of Ang I-induced pressor responses (ID50 30 micrograms/kg) following oral administration to rats. Oral administration of trandolapril (30-1000 micrograms/kg) to dogs inhibited Ang I pressor responses for over 6 h. The depressor action of bradykinin in the rat was potentiated by i.v. trandolapril and RU 44403 with ED50 values of 5.5 +/- 0.8 and 4.9 +/- 0.3 micrograms/kg respectively. Trandolapril was 2.3-10-fold more potent than enalapril in all experiments, depending on species or route of administration. RU 44403 and MK 422 were approximately equipotent, implying that trandolapril was more readily hydrolysed than enalapril. Trandolapril (0.3-30 mg/kg) produced dose-related, long-lasting (greater than 24 h) reductions in blood pressure (BP) in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) following oral administration. The anti-hypertensive effect was potentiated significantly in hydrochlorothiazide-pretreated SHR when the plasma renin activity was increased. Enalapril was 10-fold less potent than trandolapril in reducing BP. The anti-hypertensive action of trandolapril (3 mg/kg) was abolished in SHR that were bilaterally nephrectomized 24 h beforehand, but was maintained in SHR pretreated by indomethacin (5 mg/kg p.o.). Trandolapril (1 mg/kg i.v.) produced a modest and transient reduction in BP in anesthetized dogs. Trandolapril produced dose-related (30-1000 micrograms/kg) reductions in BP, total peripheral resistance and heart work in dogs pretreated with hydrochlorothiazide to increase plasma renin activity.", 
    "58": "An enzyme inhibition assay for the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor benazeprilat is described. Plasma and urine samples were diluted and endogenous ACE was inactivated by heating. After incubation of the plasma samples with hippuryl-histidyl-leucine as substrate and blank plasma as the source of ACE, released hippuric acid was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Urine samples were incubated with [3H] hippuryl-glycyl-glycine and with rabbit lung extract as the source of ACE. Released [3H] hippuric acid was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Drug standards for the standard curve were prepared in the biological matrix. A cross-check with a gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric method showed good agreement, demonstrating that this enzymic method is suitable for assessing drug bioavailability and pharmacokinetics.", 
    "59": "The hydrolytic cleavage of angiotensin I has been studied in homogenate preparations of rat lung and aorta using gradient elution HPLC to monitor the formation of peptide products. Fresh crude homogenate preparations produced a rapid breakdown of angiotensin I to largely unidentifiable fragment peptides. Neither His-Leu nor angiotensin II was observed in these preparations even in the presence of captopril (20 microM) and the amino-peptidase inhibitors, puromycin, amastatin and bestatin. However, in freeze-thawed homogenates, angiotensin II and His-Leu were detectable together with the tetrapeptide, angiotensin (1-4). The addition of captopril (20 microM) reduced the amount of angiotensin II produced but did not completely block its formation. Higher concentrations of captopril or the addition of enalaprilat or EDTA did not further reduce the amount of angiotensin II produced. In the presence of captopril a peptide corresponding to des-Leu(10)angiotensin I was formed in relatively large amounts (equivalent to 40% of angiotensin I catabolized). Homogenates purified by concanavalin A affinity chromatography gave a clean hydrolysis of angiotensin I to angiotensin II and His-Leu which was completely blocked by captopril. These results suggest an ACE-like activity in rat lung and aorta that is not sensitive to converting enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "60": "Current data support the existence of an endogenous renin-angiotensin system in the heart. Vascular angiotensin may contribute to the regulation of coronary vascular tone. Enhanced local angiotensin production in areas of vascular injury or inflammation may result in increased vasoconstriction or vasospasm. Cardiac angiotensin may adversely influence myocardial metabolism and provoke ventricular arrhythmia during ischemia and reperfusion-induced myocardial injury. Local angiotensin may stimulate cardiac contractility. In addition, angiotensin may influence cardiac myocyte growth and may contribute to the development of cardiac hypertrophy in hypertension. Recent data show that the pharmacologic inhibition of cardiac angiotensin converting enzyme may have important therapeutic consequences for the ischemic, hypertrophic, or failing heart.", 
    "61": "Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are known to improve cardiac performance in patients with severe heart failure, and are probably safer and more effective than other vasodilators. Less is known about their effects in mild and moderate heart failure. Results at one year are presented about an ongoing double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel-group study on 94 outpatients in New York Heart Association functional class II and III. After a three-week period during which appropriate doses of digoxin were administered and a stable response to exercise was obtained, diuretic therapy was withdrawn if in use and captopril or placebo treatment was assigned randomly. The assessment of patients was performed by symptom history, clinical examination, New York Heart Association functional class, chest radiograph, 12-lead electrocardiogram, 24-hour Holter monitoring, M-mode echocardiography, and bicycle exercise at the time of random selection and at specified times during a two-year follow-up. Preliminary data after one year suggest that patients receiving placebo may have a greater tendency to need diuretics and may improve New York Heart Association functional class less often than those receiving captopril. No statistically significant treatment differences were found for the noninvasive test results. Detailed analysis suggests that treatment with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor may be more advantageous than that with placebo for some groups of patients. Investigations are under way to determine which patients might benefit most from angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "62": "The effects of the converting enzyme inhibitor captopril on the susceptibility of the heart to ventricular arrhythmias following ischemia, both in vitro and in vivo, were studied. In isolated rat hearts, captopril, administered either before or at the end of ischemia, reduced ventricular fibrillation upon reperfusion after 15 minutes of local ischemia. Reduction of purine overflow, improvement in contractility, and increase in coronary blood flow occurred concomitantly. In vivo, a closed-chest pig model was used to determine the effects of captopril, administered at the end of ischemia and continued orally, on the susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias during the chronic phase of myocardial infarction. Myocardial ischemia was induced by 60-minute inflation of a balloon catheter in the left anterior descending coronary artery. Upon reperfusion, an accelerated idioventricular rhythm occurred, both in 10 untreated and in 10 captopril-treated animals. Creatine kinase levels during the reperfusion period were significantly lower after captopril treatment. Two weeks after the short-term experiments, monomorphic ventricular tachycardia could be induced with programmed electrical stimulation in six of eight surviving untreated pigs. In contrast, in none of the six surviving captopril-treated animals was ventricular tachycardia inducible. Thus, early intervention with captopril during the development phase of myocardial infarction may have beneficial effects on the subsequent development of ventricular arrhythmias. Salvage of ischemic myocardium, improvement in ventricular function, beneficial effects on coronary flow, and decreased activity of the sympathetic nervous system may all contribute.", 
    "63": "Acute myocardial infarction is associated with complex neuroendocrine changes, including release of arginine vasopressin, norepinephrine, and epinephrine, and activation of the renin-angiotensin system. Arginine vasopressin levels are maximal on admission, and subsequently fall even in patients in whom left ventricular failure develops. Plasma levels of norepinephrine and epinephrine are at their highest on admission and return to the normal range in patients with uncomplicated infarction, but they remain significantly elevated in patients in whom left ventricular failure or late ventricular arrhythmias develop. In contrast to catecholamines and arginine vasopressin, plasma renin and angiotensin levels are within normal limits on admission in patients without complications but increase by the third day. Patients with left ventricular failure already have increased plasma levels of renin and angiotensin on admission, but further marked and persistent increases occur over the following days. All of the aforementioned hormones may interact to cause systemic or coronary vasoconstriction, which may have short-term adverse hemodynamic consequences. Furthermore, increased afterload may result in infarct expansion and left ventricular dilatation, which will impair left ventricular function still further. Interruption of the cycle of vasoconstriction and worsening left ventricular failure by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors may reduce the incidence of heart failure after myocardial infarction.", 
    "64": "Angiotensin is a potent coronary vasoconstrictor, but little is known of the effects of long-term activation of the renin-angiotensin system on coronary reserve in humans. The effects of exercise on coronary hemodynamics were determined in eight patients with mild essential uncomplicated hypertension, before and after treatment with furosemide (50 mg, to ensure activation of the renin-angiotensin system). Coronary sinus blood flow was measured by thermodilution technique, intra-arterial blood pressure was measured from the ascending aorta, and plasma renin activity was determined by radioimmunoassay. Oxygen supply and demand were derived (using coronary sinus blood flow multiplied by the arteriovenous oxygen difference to equal oxygen supply and heart rate multiplied by the mean systolic blood pressure to equal oxygen demand) both at rest and during isometric exercise (handgrip to 50 percent of maximal effort for three minutes). The study was a single-blind crossover (furosemide versus placebo) design. Furosemide produced a significant reduction in coronary sinus blood flow, associated with an increase in coronary vascular resistance. Changes in mean arterial pressure and heart rate were insignificant. Slight reductions in plasma volume and mean right atrial pressure were observed. During isometric exercise, the increase in oxygen supply for a given increment in oxygen demand was attenuated by furosemide. The contribution of the renin-angiotensin system to this effect was determined by the short-term administration of 25 mg of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril. Forty-five minutes after oral captopril, coronary reserve was restored to pretreatment values. In conclusion, furosemide modulates coronary reserve, and it is likely that this is because furosemide mediates activation of renin-angiotensin system, thus reducing the vasodilatory capacity of the coronary arteries.", 
    "65": "The prevention or attenuation of the development of heart failure by the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril was examined in two animal models, spontaneously hypertensive rats and rats with myocardial infarction produced by coronary artery ligation. In 24-month-old female spontaneously hypertensive rats with marked left ventricular hypertrophy, cardiac output was reduced despite an increase in ventricular volume, resulting in a greatly reduced ejection fraction. Treatment with captopril from 14 to 24 months of age maintained forward output and prevented ventricular dilatation so that ejection fraction remained normal; left ventricular hypertrophy regressed to levels observed in six-month-old spontaneously hypertensive rats. In rats with moderate and large infarcts three months after ligation, left ventricular filling pressures were elevated, forward output was reduced, and ventricular volumes were greatly increased. Long-term therapy with captopril maintained filling pressures within normal limits and maintained forward output from a lesser dilated left ventricle to yield an ejection fraction that was elevated compared with that in untreated rats. Thus, the potentially deleterious remodeling of the left ventricle in heart failure, an extensive increase in mass and chamber volume, can be favorably altered by long-term angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition (captopril) with salutary effects on hemodynamics.", 
    "66": "Expression of the genes for renin and angiotensinogen has been documented in the heart and brain of several species, including rodents and primates. In the same tissues, local generation of angiotensin II has also been demonstrated. Neuropeptidergic brain angiotensin and local cardiac angiotensin participate in cardiovascular regulation. Inhibition of cardiac angiotensin II protects against deleterious arrythmogenic and metabolic effects of transient regional myocardial ischemia, and blockade of brain angiotensin II effectively lowers blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats. It is surmised therefore that the therapeutic effects of converting enzyme inhibitors are, in part, brought about by inhibition of local tissue angiotensin II generation in addition to their interference with the hormonal plasma renin-angiotensin system. This would help to explain their therapeutic efficacy in pathophysiologic conditions in which hypertension is associated with low plasma renin activity.", 
    "67": "In 27 hypertensive patients already receiving antihypertensive treatment and with serum total cholesterol levels between 260 and 350 mg/dl, captopril in a dosage of 50 mg twice a day was substituted for one of the drugs they were taking. Patients taking a diuretic continued the same diuretic at the same dosage. After six months of therapy that included captopril, patients resumed their former therapy. Diet and physical activity remained unchanged during the study. Biochemical and blood pressure determinations were performed before captopril was begun, after three and six months of captopril therapy, and three months after the former therapy was resumed. During the regimens that included captopril, the triglyceride value was reduced from 249 to 184 mg/dl (p less than 0.05), the total cholesterol level decreased from 287 to 237 mg/dl (p less than 0.005), and the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol value rose from 40 to 51 mg/dl (p less than 0.005). The reduction in cholesterol was unrelated to blood pressure changes or to changes in serum triglyceride, glucose, or potassium levels. Treatment regimens that included captopril also induced a greater diastolic blood pressure reduction than regimens that did not include captopril. The antihypertensive efficacy of a therapeutic regimen that includes captopril, along with its favorable effect on lipid profile, could be useful in preventing cardiovascular complications in hypertensive patients.", 
    "68": "Twenty hypertensive diabetic patients (10 with type I and 10 with type II) were treated with captopril, 50 mg twice a day, for three months. The drug was effective as monotherapy in 16 patients. An additional nine months of follow-up was obtained in 12 of these patients (four with type I and eight with type II) who did not need the addition of diuretics to achieve normal blood pressure. For these patients with long-term treatment, since there was no substantial difference between those with type I and those with type II, the data were pooled. Mean arterial pressure significantly decreased shortly after treatment was begun and the reduction was maintained. No significant change was induced by captopril in urine volume, osmolar clearance, and serum and urinary values of sodium, chloride, calcium, and magnesium, whereas significant reduction was found in fractional excretion of potassium and phosphate. The baseline levels of proteinuria were only slightly elevated, yet they fell in all patients during treatment. All patients maintained satisfactory control of carbohydrate metabolism, and none of them required substantial changes in hypoglycemic treatment. The administration of captopril as monotherapy appears to be an effective and safe way of lowering blood pressure in diabetic hypertensive patients, even in the long term, without effects on renal function and in carbohydrate metabolism.", 
    "69": "In this study, 953 patients (48 percent men) more than 60 years old with mild to moderate hypertension (class I or II) were included. After a two-week wash-out period, a starting dosage of captopril--12.5 mg twice a day--was given. Patients were examined after one and three weeks and, subsequently, at monthly intervals for a total period of four months. The dosage was adjusted to a maximum of 50 mg twice a day plus, when needed, 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide per day. Thirty-two patients were lost to follow-up, 10 withdrew because of inadequate control of blood pressure, and only 21 (2 percent) dropped out because of side effects. Mean blood pressure decreased from 184/104 to 152/87 mm Hg. The lowest dosage (25 mg a day) was sufficient to control blood pressure in 15 percent of patients, 31 percent needed 50 mg a day, and 24 percent required 100 mg a day. Hydrochlorothiazide was added to the captopril regimen in 30 percent. No substantial changes in biochemical variables or electrocardiographic results were observed. \"Quality of life\" (judged as physical fitness, positive well being, mood, and sexual desire) remarkably improved.", 
    "70": "Experimental evidence of captopril-induced inhibition of sympathetic activity, mediated by decrease in angiotensin II production, is presented. The blood pressure, plasma catecholamine, plasma renin activity, and plasma aldosterone responses to a single dose of sublingual captopril in 23 patients with hypertensive emergencies were evaluated. The major correlation found was between the captopril-induced decrease in blood pressure and the decrease in plasma norepinephrine levels (r = 0.57, p less than 0.01). In another 11 hypertensive patients with normal or high renin levels, captopril lowered by 65 percent the increase in plasma norepinephrine induced by cold immersion of the forearm. In both circumstances, plasma renin and aldosterone levels changed in accordance with the expected inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme activity. These data suggest that, in selected circumstances in hypertensive patients, captopril exhibits a depressive influence on sympathetic activity along with the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "71": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of short-term captopril administration on the response to cold pressor testing in normotensive and hypertensive subjects. Cold pressor testing was performed in 15 normotensive subjects and 15 hypertensive patients before and 90 minutes after captopril administration. Blood pressure and heart rate were measured before testing and at one-minute intervals from the beginning of cold pressor testing. Systolic time intervals were also assessed before and after testing. Captopril did not affect pressor responses to cold pressor testing in normotensive subjects or hypertensive patients. Basal heart rate (before testing) did not change, despite the decrease in blood pressure and showed a smaller increase in response to cold pressor testing in normotensive subjects, suggesting that captopril might interfere with arterial baroreflexes. The systolic time intervals were not modified by captopril except isometric contraction time; its basal value was reduced by captopril in both normotensive subjects and hypertensive patients. Cold exposure caused a similar increase in isometric contraction time before and after captopril in normotensive subjects, and the increase in isometric contraction time in hypertensive patients was greater. These findings suggest that captopril did not affect cardiac performance, indeed improving it, at least in basal conditions.", 
    "72": "Results from a large multicenter study and from the published literature suggest that captopril can improve survival in patients with advanced heart failure. The survival status of 105 patients with moderately severe heart failure who participated in a multicenter, double-blind comparison of captopril and placebo therapy was ascertained on an intention-to-treat basis. During the 90-day double-blind portion of this study, 21 percent (11 of 52 patients) of placebo-assigned patients died compared with four percent (two of 53 patients) of captopril-assigned patients (p less than 0.01). In addition, six previously published studies that provided comparative mortality data were identified. In one of these, the survival rate was reported to be improved in those who received captopril; in the other five studies, no conclusion could be drawn with respect to survival since death was an infrequent event within all treatment groups. Mechanisms by which captopril may improve survival include its favorable effects on hemodynamic parameters, its association with reduced ventricular ectopic activity, and its inhibitory effects on the renin-angiotensin and sympathetic nervous systems.", 
    "73": "The effect of captopril treatment on platelet angiotensin II levels was evaluated in 12 patients with essential hypertension. Captopril significantly lowered (p less than 0.01) mean arterial blood pressure in seven patients (Group 1) and was ineffective in five (Group 2). In Group 1, a marked decrease in plasma angiotensin II levels in both the supine (from 5.5 +/- 0.5 to 2.8 +/- 0.9 pg/ml) and the upright positions (from 17.5 +/- 4.7 to 3.9 +/- 1.6 pg/ml; p less than 0.0025) and a significant increase in platelet angiotensin II levels (from 10.5 +/- 5.3 to 22.4 +/- 17 pg/ml; p less than 0.05) after captopril treatment was observed. In Group 2, no variation was found in plasma angiotensin II levels, whereas platelet angiotensin II levels increased slightly (from 10.8 +/- 3.1 pg/ml to 16.9 +/- 5.2 pg/ml; NS). These findings suggest that the decrease in plasma angiotensin II levels can lead to an increase in platelet angiotensin II receptors or can lead to angiotensin II production in platelets through activation of a feedback mechanism. The second hypothesis suggests that platelets have alternative enzymatic pathways leading to angiotensin II production not inhibited by captopril.", 
    "74": "This study evaluated by echocardiography (M-mode tracings, two-dimensional-guided) the effects of captopril administration for one year (25 to 50 mg twice a day, alone or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide when necessary) on left ventricular mass index, on systolic function at rest and during stress (hand grip for three minutes and cold pressor test for three minutes), and on diastolic function in 15 patients with essential hypertension (13 men and two women, aged 30 to 67 years) with left ventricular hypertrophy. In addition, supine and standing plasma catecholamine concentrations, plasma renin activity, and plasma aldosterone levels were measured. Examinations were performed during a placebo period and after three, six, and 12 months of captopril treatment. Blood pressure was significantly reduced (p less than 0.001), but heart rate did not change. Left ventricular hypertrophy was progressively reduced during treatment, mainly through reduction of left ventricular wall thickness. After one year, all patients had a normal left ventricular mass index (less than 120 g/m2). Before and during treatment, left ventricular systolic function, at rest and on maximal hand grip and cold pressor testing, evaluated on the basis of fractional shortening as related to end-systolic stress, was within the 95 percent confidence limits (calculated in a group of 25 normal subjects) in all 15 patients with essential hypertension. The percent increase in left ventricular dimensions during the diastolic rapid filling phase was significantly increased by treatment (p less than 0.05), indicating improvement of left ventricular relaxation. As expected, plasma renin activity was increased, plasma aldosterone levels were decreased, and plasma catecholamine concentrations did not change. These results indicate that long-term treatment with captopril has beneficial effects on left ventricular anatomy and function in patients with essential hypertension.", 
    "75": "In patients with hypertension, structural changes develop in the heart and in the systemic arteries that have a significant role in the maintenance and gradual worsening of the hypertensive disease. Blood pressure, basal and post-ischemic \"maximal\" forearm blood flow (strain-gauge venous occlusive plethysmography), and echocardiographic left ventricular mass index were measured in 28 hypertensive patients (WHO class I or II, 23 men and five women, aged 26 to 59 years). Minimal vascular resistance (mean arterial pressure/peak blood flow) was taken as an index of vascular structural changes. The same measurements were made in a group of 14 patients before and after long-term antihypertensive treatment: in eight patients after six and 12 months of treatment with captopril (50 mg twice a day, plus 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide per day if necessary) and in six patients after six months of treatment with nitrendipine (20 mg per day, plus 50 mg of atenolol per day if necessary). A significant but weak direct correlation was found between the degree of left ventricular hypertrophy and mean arterial pressure (r = 0.41) or minimal vascular resistance (r = 0.31). Thus, patients were categorized according to whether they had left ventricular hypertrophy or impaired blood flow; the results suggested that left ventricular hypertrophy may be detected earlier than increased minimal vascular resistance. After six months of treatment, both captopril and nitrendipine significantly reduced left ventricular mass index and minimal vascular resistance. Left ventricular mass index was normalized in 50 percent of the patients, whereas minimal vascular resistance was normalized in one patient only. After 12 months of treatment, left ventricular mass index was normalized in all patients; minimal vascular resistance was on the average further reduced but normalized in only one additional patient. Thus, regression of cardiovascular structure also seems to occur earlier in the heart.", 
    "76": "The effects of converting enzyme inhibition on the cardiac mass, isomyosins polymorphism, and collagen network in the left ventricle have been studied in renovascular, hypertensive, spontaneously hypertensive, and normotensive rats. The isoenzyme profile of left ventricular myosins was used as an indirect marker of the intrinsic property of contractility, whereas the collagen network, measured by a morphometric method, represented an indirect structural marker of the arrhythmogenic risk. One-clip, two-kidney renovascular hypertension was associated with cardiac hypertrophy, a shift in the isomyosin profile, and accumulation of collagen within the left ventricular myocardium. In this renin-angiotensin-dependent model, one month of treatment with converting enzyme inhibitor normalized blood pressure and consistently reversed cardiac hypertrophy and the isomyosin profile. Converting enzyme inhibitor treatment of 12-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats for three months significantly decreased blood pressure but did not completely normalize it. The increase in cardiac mass observed in spontaneously hypertensive rats was not reversed by this short treatment. Nevertheless, the percentage of the V1 form of myosin increased slightly after treatment, and the collagen content of the left ventricle was considerably decreased. Converting enzyme inhibition did not decrease blood pressure in DOCA-salt hypertension, and no changes were observed in cardiac hypertrophy, isomyosin profile, or the collagen network. The cardiac hypertrophy that occurs with aging in normotensive rats was associated with a significant shift in isomyosin profile and a large accumulation of collagen. Thus, aging mimics several of the quantitative and qualitative changes in the left ventricular protein profile observed in hypertension. In young normotensive rats, converting enzyme inhibition significantly decreased blood pressure and left ventricular mass, increased the percentage of V1 isomyosin, and prevented the accumulation of collagen. In one-year-old normotensive rats, treatment for six months with converting enzyme inhibitor decreased blood pressure, decreased cardiac mass, and prevented the accumulation of collagen; the isomyosin profile was not modified. Converting enzyme inhibition, by acting on cardiac afterload, can bring about quantitative and qualitative changes in the cardiac proteins of both hypertensive and normotensive rats.", 
    "77": "The effects of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, SA-446, on regional hemodynamics were examined in conscious renal and spontaneously hypertensive rats (RHR, SHR) using the radioactive microsphere method. We observed the differences in regional hemodynamics between hypertensive rats and normotensive rats, as well as the differences between SHR and RHR. An i.v. administration of SA-446 at a dose of 1 mg/kg induced a considerable hypotension in both types of hypertensive rats and increased the flow rates in most organs, along with an increase of cardiac output. The systemic and regional hemodynamic changes due to SA-446 in SHR and RHR were not qualitatively different, but the organs in RHR responded to SA-446 with greater magnitude. SA-446 increased the flow rates in organs which originally had low flow rates, more than it increased those of normotensive control rats.", 
    "78": "The interactive effects of the coadministration of steady-state cimetidine and single-dose pentopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, on the pharmacokinetic disposition of each other were studied in humans. Cimetidine reduced the clearance of pentopril by 11 to 14%. This reduction in clearance was shown to be caused by a reduction in liver blood flow probably mediated through H2 receptor blockade. Meanwhile pentopril induced the oral clearance of cimetidine by 21%, presumably by a reduction in the bioavailable fraction of cimetidine. The mechanism of this interaction is unknown.", 
    "79": "Patients with CHF are commonly encountered in clinical practice. Cardiac arrhythmias, particularly complex ventricular premature contractions, often occur in these patients. The presence of ventricular tachyarrhythmia, especially ventricular tachycardia, denotes a poor prognosis. Patients with CHF already have a limited life span, and the presence of ventricular arrhythmia further increases an already high death rate. Although previous reports failed to show any significant effect of treatment on mortality in patients with CHF, results of recent studies are encouraging. Several reports have shown that treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and newer antiarrhythmic agents reduces the frequency of ventricular arrhythmia and decreases mortality. It is hoped that the results of these studies will be confirmed in well-controlled, large-scale, prospective trials.", 
    "80": "Our objectives were to examine the role of vasopressin and renin in the regulation of peripheral vascular tone in an animal model of right ventricular failure due to chronic (10 wk) pulmonic stenosis. We tested in chronically instrumented conscious control rats and in rats with pulmonic stenosis on a normal and a high-sodium diet both vasoconstrictor systems by applying specific inhibitors. The rats with pulmonic stenosis showed significant hemodynamic changes, a hypertrophy of the right ventricle, increased levels of plasma renin concentration, and inappropriately elevated plasma levels of vasopressin in comparison to control animals. Plasma renin concentration was suppressed in the sodium-loaded controls. After the administration of a specific inhibitor of the vascular receptors of arginine vasopressin [30 micrograms, d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)AVP], we found no hemodynamic changes in control rats on the normal diet, a reduction of mean arterial pressure in the sodium-loaded controls (4 +/- 4 mmHg; P less than 0.005), and in the animals with pulmonic stenosis and normal sodium intake (5 +/- 5 mmHg; P less than 0.001) and high-salt diet (6 +/- 7 mmHg; P less than 0.02). Intravenous bolus injection of teprotide (1 mg/kg) resulted in a decrease of mean arterial pressure in the control group (normal diet) of 9 +/- 8 mmHg (P less than 0.005). The fall of blood pressure (22 +/- 10 mmHg; P less than 0.001) in the rats with pulmonic stenosis was significantly greater (P less than 0.01) and was strongly related to plasma renin concentration. Therefore, vasopressin and the renin-angiotensin system contribute to an increase of peripheral vascular tone in chronic pulmonic stenosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "81": "Pharmacokinetic properties of a new angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, delapril (CV-3317), which converts to two active metabolites (M-1 and M-2) and one inactive metabolite (M-3) after oral administration, were investigated in six subjects with normal, 10 subjects with slight (SRF), and six subjects with markedly (MRF) deteriorated kidney function. The elimination half-life of M-1 was prolonged significantly in subjects with MRF and that of M-3 was also prolonged in subjects with SRF or MRF. The peak plasma drug concentration, time to reach peak concentration (tmax), and AUC were significantly larger in subjects with SRF and MRF than in normal subjects, except for Tmax in subjects with SRF. In M-2 and unchanged delapril, no difference was observed. The 24-hour cumulative urinary excretion of those metabolites was significantly lower in subjects with MRF than in normal subjects. Plasma angiotensin-converting enzyme activity, suppressed at 4 hours in all subjects, remained significantly low in patients with MRF at 24 hours. Blood pressure was reduced more in subjects with chronic renal failure. It was concluded that delapril is excreted mainly through the kidney and its pharmacodynamics and biologic effects are affected by the renal dysfunction.", 
    "82": "The cardiovascular effects of a newly developed angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, calcium(-)-N-[(S)-3-[(N-cyclohexylcarbonyl-D-alanyl)thio]-2- methylpropionyl]-L-prolinate (MC-838, altiopril calcium), were examined in anesthetized spontaneously hypertensive rats and isolated donor-perfused, rat heart preparations, and compared with those of captopril. Equidepressor doses of MC-838 (0.3 and 3 mg/kg) and captopril (0.03 and 0.3 mg/kg) given i.v. induced dose-dependent decreases in systemic blood pressure, left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP), LVdP/dT max, and femoral, renal and mesenteric vascular resistance. MC-838 as well as captopril had no significant effects on femoral blood flow (except for 3 mg/kg MC-838) and heart rate (HR). Marked and sustained increases in renal blood flow were observed with the ACE inhibitors. These agents caused two-phase changes in mesenteric blood flow: initial increase followed by decrease. In isolated, donor-perfused rat heart preparations, MC-838 (0.01-1 mg) injected locally into the coronary artery resulted in positive inotropic effects, as indicated by dose-dependent increases in LVSP and LVdP/dT max, with no significant changes in HR, while captopril (0.01-1 mg) had negative inotropic effects. The positive inotropic response to MC-838 appears to be due to Ca++ in the MC-838 solution.", 
    "83": "The antihypertensive effects of altiopril calcium (MC-838), calcium(-)-N-[(S)-3-[(N-cyclohexylcarbonyl-D-alanyl)thio]-2-methyl- propionyl]-L-prolinate, a novel inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme, compared with captopril, were evaluated in conscious rat models of experimental hypertension. MC-838 (3-30 mg/kg p.o.) as well as captopril (3 and 10 mg/kg p.o.) dose-dependently lowered systemic blood pressure (SBP) with no consistent changes in heart rate (HR) in two-kidney renal hypertensive rats (2 KG-RHRs) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). However, MC-838 and captopril, unlike hydralazine, did not significantly produce hypotension in DOCA-salt hypertensive rats. The antihypertensive effect of MC-838, compared with captopril, was characterized by a slower onset and longer duration. When compared on a weight basis of 3 mg/kg, the antihypertensive effect of MC-838 was comparable to that of captopril in magnitude, but the duration of action was approximately 2 times longer than that of captopril. MC-838, like captopril, attenuated angiotensin-I (A-I)-induced pressor response, and augmented bradykinin (BK)-induced depressor one in SHRs. However, no correlation was observed between the modification of the SBP response to exogenous i.v. A-I or BK, and the SBP lowering caused by MC-838 or captopril given orally. In contrast, there was a close correlation between inhibition of lung angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) (but not plasma ACE) and SBP reduction induced by the 2 ACE inhibitors in SHRs. When administered orally once a day for 9 weeks in 2 KG-RHRs and SHRs, MC-838 dose-dependently reduced SBP throughout the treatment period. After withdrawal of treatment with MC-838 there was no rebound increase in SBP. These studies indicate that MC-838 is a promising antihypertensive agent.", 
    "84": "Antagonism by neuro-amino acids of the central effects of angiotensin II and renin in rats was investigated. Angiotensin II (100 ng), injected into the preoptic area, stimulated the intake of water but not salt, to a lesser extent and with a shorter duration as compared with that induced by renin (5 mU), injected into the preoptic area. This angiotensin II-induced intake of water was markedly inhibited by [Sar1, Ile8]-angiotensin II, an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, but not by captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, previously administered through the same cannula. The angiotensin II-induced intake of water was also inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) (50-100 micrograms), muscimol, a GABA agonist, (100-200 ng), taurine (100-200 micrograms) and hypotaurine (100-200 micrograms), administered into the cerebroventricle and by GABA (5-10 micrograms), muscimol (10-20 ng) and taurine (10-20 micrograms) injected into the preoptic area in smaller doses. Renin (5 mU), injected into the preoptic area, elicited a marked increase in the intake of water and salt, which lasted for about 3 days. The effect of renin was inhibited by [Sar1, Ile8]-angiotensin II (10 micrograms) and was eliminated by captopril (25 micrograms) injected into the preoptic area. This effect of renin was not influenced by the peripheral administration of captopril. The effect of renin was also inhibited by GABA, muscimol or taurine injected into the cerebroventricle, in larger doses, or into the preoptic area in smaller doses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "85": "The effects of chronic administration of metoclopramide or bromocriptine (two drugs which act as antagonist and agonist of dopamine receptors) on the zona glomerulosa of captopril-treated rats administered maintenance doses of angiotensin II, were investigated by combined morphometric and biochemical techniques. It was found that metoclopramide provoked a significant hypertrophy of the zona glomerulosa and its parenchymal cells, coupled with a persistent rise in the plasma concentration of aldosterone, only in rats fed a normal diet. Conversely, bromocriptine exerted an evident inhibitory effect on the zona glomerulosa growth and steroidogenic capacity only in chronically sodium-deprived animals. These findings strongly suggest that sodium balance modulates the activity of the dopaminergic system, whose chronic suppression may be involved in the mechanism underlying the extra-angiotensin adrenoglomerulotrophic effect of prolonged sodium restriction.", 
    "86": "The mechanism of the trophic effect of chronic sodium restriction on the zona glomerulosa of the rat adrenals was investigated by combined morphometric and biochemical techniques. In the normal rats, prolonged sodium deprivation caused a significant hypertrophy of the zona glomerulosa and its parenchymal cells, coupled with a conspicuous rise in the plasma concentration of aldosterone. Analogous results were observed in animals simultaneously administered captopril and maintenance doses of angiotensin II. However, in this last case, the changes were significantly lower than those observed in the normal rats. These findings are compatible with the view that the activation of the renin-angiotensin system is not the sole mechanism involved in the stimulation of the growth and steroidogenic capacity of rat adrenal zona glomerulosa induced by chronic sodium restriction.", 
    "87": "To examine the possible involvement of prostaglandins (PG) in the antihypertensive action of captopril, a PG synthetase inhibitor (indomethacin) was administered to normal and one-kidney renovascular hypertensive rats treated with captopril for 2 weeks. Continuous infusion of captopril (40 micrograms/hr SC) to normal and renal hypertensive (RH) rats via an implantable osmotic pump for 14 days lowered systolic blood pressure (SBP) in RH rats only. However, administration of indomethacin (5 mg/kg SC) 3 times a week to normotensive rats pre-treated with captopril by continuous infusion (40 micrograms/hr SC), lowered SBP significantly 24 hours after the injection of indomethacin. In RH rats pre-treated with captopril, subsequent administration of indomethacin further reduced SBP. In this study, indomethacin given alone to both RH and normal rats produced no significant alteration in SBP. However, indomethacin potentiated the hypotensive effect of captopril. This action may be attributed to inhibition of PG biosynthesis. It has been reported that the effects of PGE2 within the kidneys are species dependent and in the case of the rat, cause vasoconstriction of the renal vasculature. Therefore, administration of indomethacin would attenuate the vasoconstricting effects of PGE2 and thus lower blood pressure. Accordingly, based on these observations, PGs may perhaps play a role in mediating the hypotensive effect of captopril.", 
    "88": "The prevalence of hypertension and the incidence of complications from uncontrolled elevated blood pressure in blacks is much greater than in the white population. In general, blacks have underlying differences in the factors relating to blood pressure level, including low plasma renin, and, in certain instances, a decreased ability to excrete sodium. The stepped-care approach in the management of the black hypertensive patient is similar to that taken with white patients, but racial differences in response to antihypertensive drugs exist that require careful consideration when choosing a treatment regimen. Thiazide diuretics are effective in blacks and are often used as initial therapy. Blacks tend to respond less well to \u03b2-blockers, but when combined with a diuretic, they are also effective. Encouraging data are available on the use of calcium channel blockers in blacks. When combined with a diuretic, the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors also provide an alternative to therapy for black patients. The use of low doses of ACE inhibitors has reduced the high incidence of adverse effects associated with this group of drugs in earlier studies.", 
    "89": "The purpose of this brief review is to separate the characteristic properties and side effects attributable to the pharmacology of the whole class of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors from those attributable to the chemical structure and kinetics of each particular ACE inhibitor. The former would be predictable and probably similar for all agents and, therefore, would be expected to recur with each agent, whereas the latter are likely to be characteristic of individual compounds and may be avoidable by changing to another compound with similar pharmacology but different molecular structure.", 
    "90": "Isolated rat hindlegs were perfused with Krebs-Ringer solution, and immunoreactive angiotensin II (irAng II) released into the perfusate was directly determined using a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge connected to the perfusion system. High performance liquid chromatography clearly demonstrated the presence of angiotensin I (Ang I), angiotensin II (Ang II), and a small amount of angiotensin III. The spontaneous release of irAng II was as high as about 600 pg/30 min, which was stable up to 3 hours. Captopril added to the perfusion medium (10(-9) to 10(-6) M) suppressed irAng II release in a dose-dependent manner (p less than 0.001), and it (10(-6)M) caused a reciprocal increase of irAng I release (p less than 0.05). Oral pretreatment of captopril (50 mg/kg/day) for 1 week suppressed the irAng II release by 31% (p less than 0.02). The same treatment with SA 446, a highly lipophilic angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, inhibited the irAng II release by 63% (p less than 0.001). On the other hand, the two inhibitors suppressed the plasma irAng II to very similar extents. Pretreatment with SA 446 plus nephrectomy did not cause any further change in irAng II release as compared with that with SA 446 alone. These results provide direct proof for local generation and subsequent secretion of Ang II by peripheral vascular tissue.", 
    "91": "The sequence and magnitude of acute changes in renal blood flow following administration of captopril were determined in a canine model of acute unilateral renal artery stenosis using rubidium-82 and positron emission tomography. Data were recorded in each of nine dogs under three conditions: 1) during a baseline control interval, 2) during renal artery stenosis, and 3) during stenosis with intravenous injection of captopril (1.2 mg/kg). Mean arterial blood pressure was 108 +/- 12 mm Hg at control, increased significantly to 125 +/- 13 mm Hg (p less than 0.01) during stenosis, and decreased to 98 +/- 13 mm/Hg (p less than 0.01) after captopril infusion. Mean renal blood flow was calculated using a steady state single compartment model from the images produced by positron emission tomography. The estimated flow to the affected kidney was 3.37 +/- 1.48 ml/min/g at control, 0.86 +/- 0.62 ml/min/g during stenosis (p less than 0.01), and 0.64 +/- 0.57 ml/min/g after captopril administration (p = NS compared with precaptopril value). The estimated flow to the contralateral kidney was minimally reduced from a baseline of 3.84 +/- 0.95 to 3.24 +/- 1.13 ml/min/g (p = NS) during stenosis and increased after captopril infusion (4.08 +/- 0.94 ml/min/g; p = 0.01). These data suggest that repetitive imaging with positron emission tomography can be used to delineate acute changes in renal perfusion following captopril administration.", 
    "92": "Six forms of renin with different isoelectric points (pIs) have been described in rats. This study was designed to determine if any of the renin forms have different biological activities. Each form of rat renin was semipurified and injected intravenously or intraventricularly in Sprague-Dawley rats anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium or Inactin. Changes in blood pressure (BP), renal function, sodium, and water excretion were observed, before and following equipressor doses; the peak response of BP was similar for all forms. However, the half-lives were significantly different. Form 4 (pI = 5.2) caused a significant increase in urine flow, Na, and K excretion, and urinary osmolality when given intravenously. The other forms were without significant effect. Infusion of converting enzyme inhibitor not only completely blocked the BP response, but also prevented the natriuresis and diuresis. This was observed in rats anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium or Inactin. Intraventricular infusions resulted in a diuresis and natriuresis when form 6 (pI = 4.8) was infused, but not with other forms. BP remained unchanged throughout. This study presents evidence that functional differences exist between renin forms.", 
    "93": "Angiotensin II has been implicated in the regulation of medullary blood flow and is known to interact with prostaglandins at sites within the kidney. Therefore the role of angiotensin in control of vasa recta blood flow was studied in antidiuretic, Munich-Wistar rats. We also tested the hypothesis that prostaglandins act to modulate the effect of angiotensin. Total renal blood flow was measured by an electromagnetic flow probe, vasa recta blood flow by a dual-slit method. Captopril was used to confirm that angiotensin blockade increased renal blood flow (by 15 +/- 4%). Captopril and saralasin were used to show that angiotensin blockade increased vasa recta blood flow (by 23 +/- 9 and 14 +/- 7%, respectively). The results demonstrate a tonic constrictor effect of angiotensin in the renal medulla. Exogenous angiotensin II, delivered intravenously, failed to mimic the effect of endogenous angiotensin. Indomethacin did not alter blood pressure or renal blood flow but did reduce vasa recta blood flow by 20 +/- 3%, suggesting that prostaglandins act preferentially on the medullary circulation. Nor did it alter the response of blood pressure, of renal blood flow, or of vasa recta blood flow to captopril. Moreover, prior angiotensin blockade with either captopril or saralasin enhanced the medullary vasoconstrictor effect of indomethacin (P less than 0.05). These results are not consistent with the hypothesis that prostaglandins act primarily as angiotensin modulators. They suggest that the medullary interaction between angiotensin and prostaglandins differs from that in the cortex.", 
    "94": "There is convincing evidence that ACE inhibitors, alone or in combination with a diuretic, effectively lower blood pressure in patients with all grades of essential or renovascular hypertension and that they are of particular benefit as adjunctive therapy in patients with congestive heart failure. The hemodynamic, hormonal and clinical effects of the presently available ACE inhibitors, captopril and enalapril, are comparable and their side effect profiles are extremely favorable. One important difference between the two oral ACE inhibitors, however, is their pharmacokinetics; enalapril's action is slower to begin and is of longer duration. Compared with other agents, ACE inhibitors offer important advantages, among them an improved feeling of well being. It is, therefore, expected that ACE inhibitors will gain greater acceptance by patients and physicians in the future.",

To emphasize that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors should be considered among possible etiologies of cough, we report recent experience with two patients and review the available experience with ACE inhibitor-induced cough.", 
    "96": "Clearances of inulin (CIn) and p-aminohippurate (CPAH) were measured in four groups of rats before and after intravenous administration of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA): 1) controls, on normal Na intake, 2) captopril-treated (30 mg.kg-1.day-1) on normal Na intake, 3) Na depleted, and 4) Na depleted, captopril-treated. In Na-depleted animals, CIn and CPAH were similar to controls but decreased significantly with ASA. In Na-depleted, captopril-treated rats, CPAH was slightly decreased, but CIn was significantly reduced (P less than 0.01). Both were not affected by ASA. Urine output was unchanged and the kidneys appeared normal on histological examination. The production of prostaglandins E2 (PGE2), F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha), and thromboxane B2 (TxB2) was measured in isolated glomeruli, cortical tubule suspensions, and medullary and papillary slices. Captopril increased PGE2 production by glomeruli and PGF2 alpha and TxB2 synthesis in papillary slices. Na depletion selectively enhanced the production of PGE2 by glomeruli and papillae. In contrast, the synthesis of prostanoids was significantly decreased in captopril-treated, Na-depleted rats. These findings suggest that in this model, functional nonoliguric renal failure may be related to abnormalities of prostanoid synthesis.", 
    "97": "1. The effect of captopril 12.5 mg three times daily for 14 days on baroreflex sensitivity was investigated in six normotensive salt-replete male subjects. 2. Baroreflex sensitivity [delta R-R interval ms/mmHg systolic blood pressure (SBP)] was assessed following decreases and increases in SBP with glyceryl trinitrate and phenylephrine respectively and during Valsalva's manoeuvre. 3. Captopril had no effect on supine intra-arterial SBP or R-R interval on days 1 and 15 compared with placebo. However decreases (P less than 0.05) which occurred in plasma angiotensin II on day 1 (12.3 +/- 0.8 to 7.6 +/- 1.5 pg ml-1) and on day 15 (14.5 +/- 1.5 to 6.3 +/- 0.5 pg ml-1) and increases (P less than 0.02) in plasma renin activity on day 1 (1.2 +/- 0.7 to 4.8 +/- 0.8 ng A I ml-1 h-1) and on day 15 (1.1 +/- 0.2 to 5.4 +/- 0.9 ng A I ml-1 h-1) compared with placebo, indicated angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition. 4. Baroreflex sensitivity was unchanged by captopril on day 1 and day 15 compared with placebo following the use of glyceryl trinitrate and phenylephrine to deactivate and activate respectively the baroreceptors, and during the strain and release phases of Valsalva's manoeuvre.", 
    "98": "Clinical and experimental data suggest that both Captopril and angiotensin II (AII) reduce baroreflex responsiveness, and the main action of this converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI) seems clear to suppress AII synthesis. The aim of this work is to investigate this striking similarity of effects. We have verified that CEI (4 mg/kg) originates tachycardia significantly lower (P less than 0.001) than that produced in response to a similar hypotension elicited by an unspecific vasodilator: sodium nitroprusside (10-45 micrograms/kg min). CEI SQ 20881 has been reported to increase plasma vasopressin concentrations (AVP); this peptide is also known to modify baroreflex responses and has a small direct negative chronotropic effect. However, our determinations of AVP do not show any difference between the control group and the group treated with Captopril (4.78 +/- 0.87 and 5.26 +/- 0.19 pg/ml respectively). On the other hand, although CEI did not modify the rapid responses of heart rate (HR) to changes of mean arterial pressure (MAP), the decrease of MAP induced by nitroprusside was higher in the group treated with Captopril than in control group; it could mean a baroreflex ability decrease to buffer the hypotension. However, AII elicited a strong impairment of both rapid responses of HR and the buffering of hypotension produced by NP, these actions being suggested as centrally mediated. These results could indicate that the suppression of peripheral AII synthesis and therefore, the lack of pre- and postjunctional sympathetic potentiation owing to this hormone, is responsible for the absence of tachycardia under Captopril treatment.", 
    "99": "Ten patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with normal left ventricular function were given a single dose of captopril (0.25 mg/kg). Mean systemic arterial pressure, heart rate and coronary flow to the right ventricle were reduced significantly after captopril. In contrast captopril did not cause a significant fall in pulmonary arterial pressure or pulmonary vascular resistance. We conclude that captopril fails to produce haemodynamic benefits in such hypoxic patients and that angiotensin II is not playing a significant role in maintaining pulmonary vasoconstriction.", 
    "100": "Arterial diameter, blood flow and vascular resistance of the common carotid artery were studied using a pulsed Doppler system in patients with uncomplicated sustained essential hypertension and compared with age-matched normal subjects. In hypertensive patients below the age of 45 years, arterial diameter and blood flow remained within the normal range, while vascular resistance was increased. In hypertensive patients over 45 years of age, arterial diameter was also normal, but blood flow was reduced and vascular resistance markedly increased. Thus, both small and large arteries were altered in the common carotid circulation of patients with sustained essential hypertension. Acute oral administration of converting enzyme inhibitor produced dilatation of both small (vascular resistance) and large (arterial diameter) arteries in the carotid circulation. In addition, in older patients, blood flow significantly increased and vascular resistance markedly decreased both in acute and long-term situations. Thus converting enzyme inhibition was able to reverse the abnormalities of the common carotid circulation of older subjects with sustained essential hypertension.",

The purpose of this study was to determine whether angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition could reverse left ventricular dilation and improve the diastolic properties of the left ventricle very early after coronary occlusion. The acute time course of left ventricular dilation and infarct expansion (as determined by two-dimensional echocardiography) and early diastolic isovolumic relaxation time were studied in 20 dogs subjected to 3 h of coronary occlusion. End-diastolic area before occlusion was 8.4 +/- 0.5 and 8.9 +/- 0.7 cm2 (p = NS) in the captopril- and the saline-treated group, respectively. At 30 min after occlusion (pretreatment), end-diastolic area increased to 12.6 +/- 0.8 cm2 in the captopril-treated group (p less than 0.01) and 11.3 +/- 0.9 cm2 (p less than 0.05) in the saline-treated group. Three hours after occlusion and after captopril treatment, end-diastolic area decreased to 9.4 +/- 0.6 cm2 (p less than 0.05 versus 30 min after occlusion), whereas it was unchanged in the saline-treated group. Functional infarct expansion (as assessed by end-systolic anterior to posterior endocardial segment length ratio) occurred early after occlusion, and captopril reduced this expansion. Pretreatment values for early diastolic isovolumic relaxation time increased from 29.1 +/- 2.4 to 50.5 +/- 2.9 ms in captopril-treated dogs (p less than 0.01) and from 34.3 +/- 3.4 to 46.9 +/- 2.7 ms in saline-treated dogs (p less than 0.01) after coronary occlusion, implying a worsening of diastolic function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "102": "The purpose of this study was to assess the role of kinins in the acute antihypertensive effect of the converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI) enalaprilat in rats with severe hypertension induced by aortic ligation between both renal arteries. For this study, we used a bradykinin analogue, D-Arg-Arg-Pro-Hyp-Gly-Thi-Ser-DPhe-Thi-Arg-TFA, with in vivo antagonistic properties. Hypertensive rats were infused intra-aortically for 15 minutes with either saline (30 microliters/min) or the kinin antagonist (40 micrograms/kg/min). Five minutes after the infusion was begun, a bolus injection of enalaprilat (60 micrograms/kg) was given. The blood pressure of the saline-infused animals decreased 48 +/- 6 mm Hg (from 180 +/- 7 to 132 +/- 7 mm Hg), while that of the rats treated with the antagonist decreased only 21 +/- 4 mm Hg (from 175 +/- 3 to 154 +/- 3 mm Hg). The difference between both decrements was significant (p less than 0.01). In another group of hypertensive animals (n = 9), we measured kinin concentration in plasma from arterial blood before and after administration of CEI (41 +/- 10 vs 68 +/- 20 pg/ml, respectively; NS). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that kinins play a role in the acute antihypertensive effect of CEIs in rats with severe hypertension. However, since arterial blood kinin concentrations were not increased significantly after CEI administration, the effect of the CEI may be due to an increase in tissue kinins, which could act as autacoids regulating vascular resistance.", 
    "103": "The metabolism of tritiated neurotensin (NT) after close i.a. perfusion in ileal segments of anesthetized dog was studied. Venous effluents containing labeled metabolites and intact NT were collected and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. The apparent half-life of the peptide was between 2 and 6 min. The tritiated metabolites of NT were identified as free tyrosine, NT-(1-7), NT-(1-8), NT-(1-10), NT-(11-13) and NT-(1-11). Pretreatment of dog ileum with thiorphan or captopril indicated that endopeptidase 24-11 inactivated NT by cleaving the peptide at the Pro10-Tyr11 and Tyr11-Ile12 bonds. Angiotensin-converting enzyme only participated in the secondary conversion of NT-(1-10) into NT-(1-8). The metabolisms of NT occurring in vivo and in vitro in central and peripheral organs are compared.", 
    "104": "Sixteen patients with hypertension entered a study in which the effects of enalapril were compared with sodium restriction, with the two in combination and with placebo using a balanced randomized double-crossover design. Each patient had four treatment phases of two weeks, duration which comprised a 2 x 2 factorial design as well as an initial period on sodium restriction and enalapril placebo. All patients received a reduced sodium diet and sodium intake was altered by slow Na tablets. Increasing sodium intake raised blood pressure similarly whether patients were receiving enalapril or its placebo. Enalapril lowered blood pressure to a similar extent in patients on either a low and high sodium intake. The combination of a low sodium intake and enalapril was additive and there was no interactive effect between the two therapies whether assessed by a linear or a logarithmic method. Plasma renin was increased by enalapril and lowered by increased sodium intake. These effects were additive and there was no interactive effect. Neither the initial plasma renin nor the rise in renin predicted which patients would respond to enalapril. Enalapril was an effective antihypertensive agent and its blood pressure-lowering effect and that of sodium restriction were additive.", 
    "105": "Renal actions of the new angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor CGS 16617 were evaluated in anesthetized dogs. Intravenous administration of 0.4 mg/kg CGS 16617 resulted in complete inhibition of the pressor response to 1 microgram angiotensin I (ANG I) for a 2 hr period. Over this period, i.v. injection of CGS 16617 significantly reduced mean arterial pressure (MAP) by 9 mmHg and significantly increased renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate. Sodium and water excretion increased significantly following converting enzyme inhibition. Intravenous injection of CGS 16617 also markedly decreased urine osmolality and produced a highly significant increase in free water formation. Intravenous infusion of 0.5 microgram/kg per min saralasin also completely inhibited the pressor response produced by 1 microgram of ANG I. Except for the absence of a significant change in urinary osmolality, the changes in MAP and renal function produced by saralasin were essentially identical to those produced by CGS 16617. The results presented in this study demonstrate that the new converting enzyme inhibitor CGS 16617 has potent actions on renal function. The similarity of the changes in blood pressure and renal function produced by CGS 16617 to those of saralasin may suggest that the consequences of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition in this model can largely be explained by inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system.",

Melatonin caused a notable hypertrophy of zona glomerulosa cells and a significant rise in the plasma concentration of aldosterone in both groups of rats. These findings indicate that melatonin exerts in vivo a strong direct stimulatory action on the growth and steroidogenic capacity of the rat zona glomerulosa.", 
    "107": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) plays an important role in the regulation of renal blood pressure by the hydrolysis of the inactive precursor peptide angiotensin I to the potent vasopressor angiotensin II. Renal ACE is a surface membrane protein of both endothelium and tubular epithelium. Enzymatically active ACE was isolated from renal homogenates by chromatography using an affinity column constructed by linking an ACE inhibitor, lisinopril, to Affi-Gel 15. Analysis of eluates from this column showed that ACE activity was increased greater than 500-fold. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrated a single band of molecular weight 144 kD (mouse) and 149 kD (bovine). N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis revealed: (formula; see text) Though bovine ACE has one additional N-terminal amino acid, these two partial sequences are highly homologous (16 of 20 positions are identical). Mouse ACE was digested with trypsin and the peptides were isolated by reverse phase HPLC. Analysis of the amino acid sequences showed that these tryptic peptides were unique to ACE. Thus, we were able to isolate ACE from bovine and mouse kidneys and show that they had substantial structural homology. They were also quite similar to that from rabbit lung.", 
    "108": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is a circulating dipeptidase which has a broad specificity and is known to metabolise a range of circulating peptides. While a number of circulating peptides are believed to modulate food intake, it is not known if ACE plays a role in the control of feeding behaviour and therefore in this study we have examined the effect of the potent, specific ACE antagonists captopril (SQ 14225) and enalapril (MK421) on food and water intake following food deprivation and 2-deoxyglucose treatment in the rat. One hour captopril (50 mg/kg, IP) pretreatment significantly reduced the food intake of 24 hr food deprived rats. Because captopril solutions have a low pH (2.0), the effect of buffered captopril on food intake following 24 hr food deprivation was also examined. Buffered captopril also significantly reduced the food intake of 24 hr food deprived rats, but not to the same extent as unbuffered captopril. Naloxone pretreatment (1 mg/kg, IP) did not antagonize the effect of captopril on food intake indicating that the anorexic action of captopril was not due to alterations in opiate peptide levels. Buffered captopril did not reduce the food intake of food-replete rats receiving 2-deoxyglucose (300 mg/kg, IP) or alter blood gases or pH. However, an equimolar buffered dose of the structurally different ACE inhibitor enalapril failed to significantly alter food deprivation-induced food intake, suggesting that this action of captopril in reducing food intake was unrelated to ACE blockade.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Side effects with both drugs were mild and the incidence was additive. 3. Blood pressure (BP) was lowered by nifedipine for 4 h, by lisinopril for 48 h and the combination showed simply additive effects. Standing heart rate was higher after the combination than after single treatment. 4. Plasma angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and renin activity (PRA), aldosterone, noradrenaline and adrenaline levels showed no evidence of an interaction. 5. The pharmacokinetics of lisinopril were unaltered by nifedipine and vice versa. 6. There is no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction between single oral doses of nifedipine and lisinopril.", 
    "110": "Inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in serum and tissues of rats was studied after administration of lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor. Tissue ACE was assessed by quantitative in vitro autoradiography using the ACE inhibitor [125I]351A, as a ligand, and serum ACE was measured by a fluorimetric method. Following oral administration of lisinopril (10 mg/kg), serum ACE activity was acutely reduced but recovered gradually over 24 hours. Four hours after lisinopril administration, ACE activity was markedly inhibited in kidney (11% of control level), adrenal (8%), duodenum (8%), and lung (33%; p less than 0.05). In contrast, ACE in testis was little altered by lisinopril (96%). In brain, ACE activity was markedly reduced 4 hours after lisinopril administration in the circumventricular organs, including the subfornical organ (16-22%) and organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (7%; p less than 0.05). In other areas of the brain, including the choroid plexus and caudate putamen, ACE activity was unchanged. Twenty-four hours after administration, ACE activity in peripheral tissues and the circumventricular organs of the brain had only partially recovered toward control levels, as it was still below 50% of control activity levels. These results establish that lisinopril has differential effects on inhibiting ACE in different tissues and suggest that the prolonged tissue ACE inhibition after a single oral dose of lisinopril may reflect targets involved in the hypotensive action of ACE inhibitors.", 
    "111": "Two ketomethylene-containing nonapeptide analogues were synthesized to determine if ketomethylene analogues of the nonapeptide venom inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) would have oral ACE inhibition activity. Both ketomethylene-containing nonapeptides 18 and 19 were potent inhibitors of rabbit lung ACE with I50s of 3.4 and 8.0 nM, respectively, compared to 340 nM for their parent nonapeptide and 450 nM for captopril. Peptide 18 was rapidly cleaved by trypsin, but 19 was reasonably stable to all enzyme degradation systems tested with maximum degradation of 50% by pepsin in 3 h. Both 18 and 19 when given iv to normotensive rats were between 3 and 10 times more potent than captopril in inhibiting an angiotensin I induced blood pressure increase. Peptide 19 showed no ACE inhibition activity in unanesthetized normotensive rats when administered orally at doses of 10 or 100 mg/kg. Experiments were conducted to determine whether 19 is adsorbed from the gastrointestinal track following oral administration. These experiments indicated that 19 is adsorbed. It is concluded that the lack of oral activity of 19 is probably due to its rapid excretion, probably into the bile.",

In vehicle-treated dogs, atrial natriuretic peptide 101-126 increased fractional sodium excretion from 1.8 +/- 0.6% to a peak response of 5.1 +/- 0.9% during infusion of 25 pmol/kg/min. The peptide progressively decreased mean arterial pressure from 110 +/- 5 to 94 +/- 4 mm Hg, renal vascular resistance from 0.40 +/- 0.02 to 0.30 +/- 0.02 mm Hg/ml/min, and arterial plasma renin activity from 4.3 +/- 1.6 to 3.1 +/- 0.8 ng/ml/hr. When the renin-angiotensin system was blocked by 3 mg/kg i.v. enalaprilat, baseline pressure fell to 86 +/- 4 mm Hg, and subsequent infusions of atrial natriuretic peptide 101-126 did not affect fractional sodium excretion. The decreases in blood pressure (from 86 +/- 4 to 76 +/- 4 mm Hg) and in renal vascular resistance (from 0.27 +/- 0.03 to 0.23 +/- 0.02 mm Hg/ml/min) were also ameliorated compared with the control responses. Intravenous infusion of 2.5 ng/kg/min angiotensin II restored mean arterial pressure and potentiated the natriuretic and renal vascular responses to atrial natriuretic peptide 101-126. In two additional groups of anesthetized dogs, enalaprilat did not produce the profound hypotension and did not affect the natriuretic responses to atrial natriuretic peptide 101-126. When renal vascular resistance was elevated by intrarenal infusion of angiotensin II in enalaprilat-treated dogs, the natriuretic response was improved.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

It was found that the drugs influencing metabolism and effects of kinins (except trasylol) exert differently pronounced antiulcer effects during modelling gastric ulcers by administering ethanol, reserpine and diclofenac sodium. At the same time they were inactive on the model of histamine-induced ulcers in rats.", 
    "114": "The 1984 report of the Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of Hypertension for the first time recommended beta blockers as an alternative to diuretics for step 1 of stepped-care treatment. Numerous studies have shown that beta blockers are as effective as diuretics for monotherapy in patients with mild hypertension. They are the only antihypertensive drugs that have been shown to be cardioprotective following a myocardial infarction. Beta blockers are especially indicated for step 1 therapy in young patients (particularly those with evidence of hyperkinetic circulation), in patients who have had a myocardial infarction, and in patients with angina, migraine, or hereditary tremor because they are helpful in treating these conditions as well as in managing hypertension. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium channel blockers are challenging beta blockers and diuretics as the drugs of choice for initial therapy of hypertension in selected patients. Time will ultimately determine the relative roles of each as step 1 therapy.", 
    "115": "The aim of this study was to examine the influence of a time factor that may lead to inaccurate interpretation of data on the incidence of side effects in a double-blind study with drug cross-over. After a washout period, 58 patients with essential hypertension received either 20 mg of enalapril or 50 mg of atenolol. After two weeks, the dosage was doubled (to 40 mg of enalapril and 100 mg of atenolol) in those patients with diastolic blood pressure higher than 95 mm Hg. After four weeks of active treatment and a second two-week washout period, patients received the alternative antihypertensive agent under the same procedure and time schedule as in the first treatment phase. Four patients dropped out. Side effects were evaluated by questionnaire at weeks 2, 4, 8, and 10. In the 54 patients who completed the study, enalapril and atenolol led to almost identical blood pressure reduction in both treatment phases, indicating that pooling these data is a sound method. However, incidence of side effects was twice as high in phase 1 as in phase 2 and markedly decreased in each treatment phase, with no differences being observed between enalapril and atenolol. These results clearly demonstrate that pooling side effects data from a cross-over study may lead to quite wrong interpretations.",

There was a reduction of exercise-induced ST depression by 22% already after the first dose of 5 mg. After 15 days of treatment the ST depression had decreased by 35% (P less than 0.05).", 
    "117": "The effect of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (25 mg by mouth) on glucose metabolism of skeletal muscle and the whole organism was studied in nine normotensive type II (non-insulin dependent) diabetics using a combination of euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic glucose-clamp and forearm catheter techniques. The administration of captopril resulted in a significant rise of both the whole-body glucose elimination and utilization rate in the forearm musculature. At the same time the arterial kinin level rose, while the concentrations of insulin, free fatty acids and gluconeogenesis precursors, as well as the number and activity of insulin receptors (measured in an erythrocyte-binding study) remained unchanged. The data support the view that, in type II diabetics, ACE inhibition raises the insulin-stimulated glucose uptake of the whole organism, predominantly due to an increased glucose uptake by the skeletal musculature. The demonstration of an increased kinin level points to this effect possibly being caused by the reduced breakdown of locally liberated kinins.", 
    "118": "The long-term survival of rats with healed myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure treated with milrinone, enalapril and the combination of milrinone plus enalapril, was documented. Seven days after sham or coronary ligation, 200 rats (99 sham and 101 myocardial infarcted) were randomized based on electrocardiographic criteria to receive tap water, milrinone (20-40 mg/l drinking water), enalapril (17-25 mg/l) or the combination of milrinone plus enalapril (20-40 mg/17-25 mg per l). The date of spontaneous death was recorded and heart weights and myocardial infarct size (by planimetry) were determined. Long-term enalapril therapy prolonged survival with a median 50% survival (MS50) of 233 days compared to 203 days in the tap water group. Milrinone therapy also prolonged survival with a MS50 of 297 days. The combination therapy prolonged survival with a MS50 of 277 days. In general, there were three times as many rats alive in the treatment groups at the end of one year compared to untreated control groups. Cardiac hypertrophy was evident in all myocardial infarcted groups and heart weights were significantly reduced by all treatments. The average myocardial infarct sizes and the distribution of infarct sizes were not different between groups (36.8-43% of left ventricle). This study demonstrates that long-term therapy with enalapril and milrinone prolongs survival in rats with healed myocardial infarctions. The prolongation of survival was comparable in the milrinone plus enalapril groups, indicating that there was no synergy with these two agents with survival as the end point.", 
    "119": "Trandolapril (3-100 micrograms/kg) and enalapril (10-300 micrograms/kg) were administered orally to conscious rats. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (CE) activity was inhibited in serum, heart ventricle, renal inner cortex, lung, aorta, adrenal cortex and adrenal medulla, but not in the striatum. Inhibition was maximal at 2 h and with trandolapril was maintained for 24 h. Blood pressure and heart rate were not affected by either compound. Trandolapril was 6-10-fold more potent than enalapril. Differences between trandolapril and enalapril in CE inhibition observed in heart ventricle, adrenal cortex and medulla could be due to the presence of more than one type of CE or CE-like activity.", 
    "120": "The influence of the renin-angiotensin system on renal hemodynamics, tubular pressure and tubulo-glomerular feedback was investigated with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor MK 421 (enalapril), in uninephrectomized rats with and without ischemia-induced acute renal failure. In animals with normal renal function proximal tubular pressure and tubulo-glomerular feedback response were lowered by enalapril long-term treatment, whereas glomerular filtration rate and renal blood flow were not influenced by the drug. After 45 and 70 minutes ischemia there was no difference between treated and untreated animals in the severely impaired glomerular filtration rate. Renal blood flow remained unaffected by the treatment. The histological damage due to ischemia (tubular casts, tubular necrosis and medullary capillary congestion) was not influenced by enalapril. As tubulo-glomerular feedback had been significantly inhibited during renin-angiotensin inhibition, its importance in mediating acute renal failure remains doubtful; other factors such as tubular obstruction and medullary congestion may be crucial.", 
    "121": "The effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition with captopril therapy (3 x 12.5 mg/d) on heavy proteinuria and kidney function was investigated in 10 insulin-treated diabetic patients over a period of 6 months. Urinary protein excretion increased from 3706 mg/day (SD 1491) to 5405 (SD 2699) after 6 months of treatment (p = 0.05); serum creatinine rose from 248 mumol/l (SD 163) to 283 (SD 186) (p less than 0.01), whereas there was no significant difference in blood pressure before (150/80 mm Hg--SD 23/6) and after therapy (150/90 mm Hg--SD 23/10). HbA1c as a marker of metabolic long-term control decreased from 8.3% (SD 1.0) to 7.3% (SD 1.0) (p less than 0.05). No beneficial effects of low dose angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition on heavy proteinuria could be demonstrated in this group of patients with advanced diabetic nephropathy. In particular, progressive deterioration of kidney function was not influenced by the captopril treatment. In diabetic patients with incipient diabetic nephropathy presenting with microalbuminuria, further studies concerning a possible therapeutic effect are necessary.",

Left ventricular volumes were measured at baseline and at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months with cross-sectional echocardiography and Simpson's rule analysis of standardised apical views. The captopril group showed no significant change in left ventricular end-diastolic volume index but left ventricular end-systolic volume index was significantly reduced and stroke volume index and ejection fraction were significantly increased from 1 month on. In contrast, the frusemide and placebo groups showed significant increases in ventricular volumes, with stroke volume index unchanged and ejection fraction slightly reduced. The changes in the captopril group were significantly different from those in the other groups.",

We have stimulated the peripheral end of the cut left splanchnic nerve in anaesthetized dogs while collecting the venous effluent of the left adrenal gland for catecholamine estimation. 2. With low frequency stimulation the resting output of catecholamines was inhibited but at high frequencies it was augmented. 3.

The dicarboxylic acids having phenyl substituents at the 6R, 6S, and 7S positions on the azepinone ring showed potent inhibition in vitro. The corresponding monoester monoacids, when administered orally, suppressed the pressor response to angiotensin I administered intravenously. The monoester monoacids having the phenyl substituent at the 6-position showed a longer duration of action than one having the substituent at the 7-position. The structure-activity relationship was studied on the basis of the conformational energy calculation.", 
    "125": "We report that the inhibition of the angiotensin converting enzyme is an effective short-term treatment of low-renin hypertension in acute glomerulonephritis (AGN). We treated 9 patients who had AGN with moderate to severe hypertension and suppressed plasma renin activity with 25-50 mg of captopril per os every 6-8 hours. Control of blood pressure was achieved in 1-2 hours and maintained thereafter. Captopril therapy was associated with an increase in plasma renin activity, a decrease in plasma aldosterone and an increase in the urinary excretion of prostaglandin E2 and kallikrein, independent of changes in urine output. Creatinine clearance increased 39.6 +/- SE 15.2% with captopril and decreased in the postcaptopril period, suggesting that captopril exerted a reversible effect on glomerular filtration rate, possibly modifying intrarenal vasoconstriction. Our study shows that rapid control of hypertension in AGN may be obtained with oral inhibition of the angiotension converting enzyme. Stimulation of PGE2 and kinins, as well as angiotensin II blockade appear to contribute to the hypotensive effect of the drug; by inference, the suppressed activity of vasodilator systems seems to play a significant role in the hypertension of AGN.", 
    "126": "The benefits of treating hypertension have been documented by several long-term studies that have shown a decreased incidence of morbidity and mortality associated with stroke, left ventricular failure, and renal insufficiency. With the large number of antihypertensive drugs currently available, several safety factors need to be considered when initially choosing a regimen so as not to adversely influence the potential benefits of blood pressure control. Antihypertensive agents should be chosen based on their hemodynamic profile, the absence of adverse metabolic effects and subjective side effects, and the presence of beneficial effects on the patients' quality of life. Thiazide diuretics and beta-blocking agents have often been recommended as initial therapy in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. However, thiazide diuretics may be less desirable in certain patients because of their effects on lipids, potassium, and glucose tolerance; beta-blocking agents are not ideal for some patients because of their effects on lipids, exercise tolerance, and overall quality of life. The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, selective alpha 1-blocking agents, and calcium channel blocking agents may be more appropriate for initial therapy of hypertension in many patients.", 
    "127": "The chemistry, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical uses, and adverse effects of nicardipine, nitrendipine, and bepridil are reviewed. Nicardipine, nitrendipine, and bepridil are calcium antagonists under investigation for the treatment of cardiovascular disorders. Nicardipine and nitrendipine share a common dihydropyridine nucleus with the calcium antagonist nifedipine; bepridil is unrelated to other known calcium antagonists. Like nifedipine, nicardipine and nitrendipine produce peripheral vasodilation as their predominant in vivo effect. Bepridil has vascular, sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodal, and myocardial effects qualitatively similar to those of the calcium antagonist verapamil; it also interferes with the fast sodium channel and prolongs refractoriness in atrial and ventricular tissue. Nicardipine and nitrendipine undergo extensive first-pass hepatic extraction after oral administration; oral bioavailability of bepridil is about 60%. All three drugs are highly protein bound and have been reported to increase plasma digoxin concentrations. Both nicardipine and nitrendipine are effective antihypertensive agents used alone or combined with diuretics, beta blockers, or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Nicardipine and bepridil effectively control angina, and preliminary studies indicate that nitrendipine has antianginal properties. Bepridil may be useful in the treatment of various cardiac arrhythmias; however, its tendency to cause or worsen cardiac arrhythmias and its association with torsade de pointes may limit its usefulness. Nicardipine and nitrendipine have similar adverse effect profiles, with vasodilation-related complaints being most common. Since nicardipine, nitrendipine, and nifedipine are similar in efficacy and safety, the eventual availability of sustained-release dosage forms may determine how these drugs are ultimately used. Bepridil is an effective antianginal drug, but, because of its proarrhythmic potential, it should probably not be used as a first-line agent.", 
    "128": "Neutral endopeptidase (NEP) (enkephalinase, EC 3.4.24.11) and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) are two peptidases that can cleave the C-terminal dipeptide bradykinin(8-9) from bradykinin. To determine whether these peptidases play roles in modulating kinin-induced contractions in the airways, we studied the effects of captopril, an ACE inhibitor, and of leucine-thiorphan and phosphoramidon, two NEP inhibitors, on the contractile responses to bradykinin and lysyl-bradykinin in isolated segments of ferret trachea. Bradykinin and lysyl-bradykinin-induced contractions in a concentration-dependent fashion (P less than .001), with a threshold of 10(-7) M and 5 x 10(-7) M, respectively. In contrast, the bradykinin(8-9) and the N-terminal heptapeptide bradykinin(1-7), the major fragments of hydrolysis of bradykinin by NEP and ACE, had a very weak or no effect on tracheal contraction in concentrations as great as 10(-5) M. Captopril, leucine-thiorphan and phosphoramidon (each inhibitor at 10(-5) M, 15 min) shifted the concentration-response curves to lower concentrations by approximately 1 to 1.5 log U (P less than .05). Both NEP inhibitors and the ACE inhibitor potentiated the response to bradykinin in a concentration-dependent fashion (P = .0001), and the combination of phosphoramidon and captopril resulted in an additive potentiation of bradykinin-induced contraction (P less than .02).

    "129": "The purpose of this study was to elucidate the mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of the angiotensin I (Ang I) converting enzyme inhibitor captopril in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Drinking responses, peripheral vascular reactivity, and angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor binding in both the brain and vascular smooth muscle were examined in control and captopril-treated SHR. Pregnant and nursing dams were treated with oral captopril (100 mg/kg). After weaning, offspring were maintained on captopril (50 mg/kg). The average systolic pressures after 21 weeks of captopril treatment were 122 +/- 3 mm Hg (male) and 118 +/- 4 mm Hg (female) as compared with 169 +/- 4 mm Hg (male) and 162 +/- 2 mm Hg (female) in age-matched controls. Drinking responses to intracerebroventricular (10 ng) and subcutaneous (100 micrograms/kg) administration of Ang I and II were attenuated in captopril-treated SHR in comparison to control SHR. Ang II receptor binding in the hypothalamus, thalamus, and septum of captopril-treated SHR was also significantly reduced. In contrast to a depressed angiotensinergic system in the brain, peripheral vascular reactivity to Ang II, as determined in isolated, artificially perfused kidneys, was elevated. Threshold and ED50 values for Ang II were significantly lower in captopril-treated SHR than in controls. Ang II receptor binding in aortic smooth muscle cells prepared from captopril-treated SHR was also significantly greater than in cells from controls. Thus, lifetime treatment with captopril induced alterations in the renin angiotensin systems in the periphery and brain that were manifested by changes in receptor binding and responsiveness to Ang II.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "130": "In rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes an increase in arterial blood pressure was observed as early as the first week after the drug was injected. Blood pressure reached maximal values around the fourth week and remained stable for a long period of follow-up. The responsiveness of these rats to the three major vasopressor hormones, angiotensin II, norepinephrine, and vasopressin, was decreased in the early phase of diabetes and returned to normal in the late phase. Acute treatment at the third, sixth, and twelfth weeks with blockers of these vasopressor hormones resulted in a significant fall in blood pressure at the third week with captopril and at the twelfth week with propranolol plus phentolamine. No significant fall was observed when a specific vasopressin inhibitor was administered. Good control of the blood pressure was obtained when these rats were treated chronically with captopril or prazosin, and partial control was achieved when they were fed a low salt diet. An attenuation in arterial blood pressure levels was observed in rats with two-kidney, one clip hypertension when diabetes was induced by streptozotocin. Plasma creatine levels in diabetic rats were significantly higher than those in control rats only in the sixth and twelfth weeks. Electron microscopy revealed some minor glomerular lesions only at the twelfth week.", 
    "131": "We have previously reported that captopril stimulates thromboxane A2 synthesis in patients with essential hypertension. In the present study, the hypotensive effects of captopril and OKY-046, a selective inhibitor of thromboxane A2 synthetase, were studied in nine patients with essential hypertension to determine whether thromboxane A2 is involved in the regulation of blood pressure. A single oral dose of OKY-046 (400 mg) decreased urinary thromboxane B2 (a stable metabolite of thromboxane A2) excretion significantly (from 113 +/- 19.0 to 51.0 +/- 6.1 pg/min; p less than 0.01) and increased urinary sodium excretion significantly (from 73.0 +/- 15.3 to 113.0 +/- 14.4 microEq/min; p less than 0.01), but no change was observed in mean arterial pressure. The administration of OKY-046 (600 mg/day) for 3 days induced a significant and sustained decrease in urinary thromboxane B2 excretion, but it did not affect the mean arterial pressure. Although captopril (50 mg) alone induced a significant increase in urinary thromboxane B2 excretion (from 91.4 +/- 11.0 to 297.3 +/- 30.8 pg/min; p less than 0.001) and a significant decrease in mean arterial pressure (from 97.0 +/- 4.7 to 88.1 +/- 5.1 mm Hg; p less than 0.01), captopril in combination with OKY-046 induced a decrease both in urinary thromboxane B2 excretion (from 70.8 +/- 12.3 to 54.2 +/- 14.7 pg/min; p less than 0.01) and in mean arterial pressure (from 105.1 +/- 3.8 to 84.2 +/- 3.6 mm Hg; p less than 0.01). Thus, the hypotensive effect of captopril was potentiated by OKY-046. OKY-046 did not affect the changes in plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone concentration and blunted urinary prostaglandin E2 and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha excretion in response to captopril. These results indicate that thromboxane A2 counteracts the hypotensive effect of captopril in patients with essential hypertension.", 
    "132": "We found that nearly 10% of 142 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) had persistent, unexplained hyperkalemia. Renal mineralocorticoid resistance has been suggested to account for the hyperkalemia in SLE. We studied the renin-aldosterone response to intravenous furosemide (60 mg) and upright posture and the renin response to converting enzyme inhibition (captopril, 50 mg) and upright posture in five patients with SLE and hyperkalemia (group 1) and five normokalemic patients with SLE (group 2). Renal function was comparable. Plasma chloride level was higher and bicarbonate level slightly lower in group 1 than in group 2. Plasma cortisol level was normal in all patients. None of the patients was receiving nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids at the time of study. Basal plasma renin concentration and plasma aldosterone level were not significantly different between the two groups, although both tended to be higher in group 2. However, four of the five patients in group 1 had significantly blunted renin response to captopril compared with group 2. The same four patients also had blunted renin and aldosterone responses to furosemide. Thus, the majority of hyperkalemic patients with SLE had an impaired renin and aldosterone response to stimulation. We conclude that hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism plays a key role in the pathogenesis of hyperkalemia in SLE.",

The effects of exogenous angiotensins II and III (50 pmol/min i.v.) on plasma renin release following captopril injection (5 mg/kg, i.v.) were studied in anaesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats, to determine whether angiotensin II blockade is the major mechanism by which captopril induces renin release. 2. Captopril produced a 12-fold increase in plasma renin concentration compared with saline-injected controls. This was completely reversed by pre-infusion of angiotensin II or III. 3. The fall in blood pressure following captopril treatment was also abolished by angiotensins II and III pre-infusion. Noradrenaline pre-infusion (200-800 ng/min, i.v.) also prevented the captopril-induced hypotension but did not alter the rise in plasma renin. 4. Ureteric ligation did not significantly reduce captopril-induced renin release suggesting that acute changes in sodium excretion or delivery of electrolyte to the macula densa were not involved in renin release. 5. These findings suggest that captopril induces renin release by inhibiting angiotensin II feedback control of renin secretion and that angiotensin III may also modulate renin release.", 
    "134": "1. The effect of a alpha-human atrial natriuretic peptide (1-28) (ANP) on human vasculature was investigated in vivo and in vitro. Possible involvement of vascular dopamine receptors and the renin-angiotensin system in the response to ANP was also studied in vivo. 2. Forearm blood blow was measured by venous occlusion plethysmography. Isolated human blood vessels were studied using conventional organ bath techniques. 3. ANP (0.1-1 microgram/min, intra-arterially) produced a dose-dependent increase in forearm blood flow, corresponding to a 163% increase in net forearm blood flow in the study arm. This action of ANP was not antagonized by (R)-sulpiride (100 micrograms/min, intra-arterially), a selective vascular dopamine receptor antagonist, or 50 mg of oral captopril, an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme. 4. ANP (1 nmol/l-1 mumol/l) produced concentration-dependent relaxation of isolated human arteries, including brachial artery, but was without effect on isolated human saphenous vein. 5. ANP produces vasodilatation in vivo and relaxes isolated human arterial smooth muscle. This action of ANP may contribute to its reported hypotensive effects in vivo.", 
    "135": "We evaluated the response to salt restriction in hypertensive patients receiving drugs. By restricting their salt intake to less than 80 mmol of sodium per day for 3 months, 50% of patients reaching goal compliance were able to discontinue diuretics. The literature also reveals responses to a low salt diet. Salt restriction augmented the hypotensive effect of chlorthalidone in two investigations, but not in another, and the hypotensive effect of beta-blockers in three trials. Sodium intake of 10 mmol/day caused a much greater decrease in blood pressure in response to a single dose of captopril than did a sodium diet of 200 mmol/day. In patients receiving various fixed regimens for 2 months, salt restriction decreased blood pressure in all but those receiving calcium blockers. A single dose of nifedipine lowered blood pressure more in patients receiving 350 mmol of sodium per day than in the same patients given 150 or 10 mmol/day. Verapamil for 3 days was more effective in patients receiving 212 mmol of sodium per day than in the same subjects receiving 9 mmol/day. Nitrendipine caused a greater decrease in diastolic blood pressure in patients who did not reduce salt intake compared to those who did. Salt restriction appears useful in salt-sensitive patients who receive beta-blockers, diuretics, converting enzyme inhibitors, or centrally acting drugs.

One-half were assigned randomly to treatment with enalapril (5 mg/kg per 24 h). 2. Untreated rats (n = 12) developed a progressive fall in creatinine clearance, a progressive rise in systolic blood pressure and marked proteinuria over a 6 week period. The mortality rate was 42% at 5 weeks and 66% at 6 weeks. 3. Enalapril-treated rats (n = 12) had no significant reduction in systolic blood pressure, and a similar reduction in creatinine clearance to that in untreated rats. Mortality was 50% at 5 weeks, and 92% at 6 weeks. 4. Proteinuria but not the blood pressure rise was significantly reduced by enalapril treatment. 5. Converting enzyme inhibitors may have a specific role in the treatment of nephritic diseases.", 
    "137": "1. 125I-351A, a tyrosyl derivative of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor lisinopril, was used as a radioligand, and radioinhibitor binding and displacement assays have been established. 2. The in vitro potency of a range of ACE inhibitors against rat ACE was determined using the radioinhibitor binding displacement assay. 3. The concentration of an ACE inhibitor needed to displace 50% of 125I-351A bound to rat ACE (ID50) was closely correlated with the concentration needed to inhibit 50% of ACE enzymatic activity (IC50). 4. Radioinhibitor binding displacement assay was used to measure the plasma concentrations of lisinopril, cilazapril and perindopril in rat plasma. 5. Plasma concentrations of lisinopril measured by radioimmunoassay were identical with that measured by radioinhibitor binding assays.", 
    "138": "Oral inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) now have an established place in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure. Captopril, the first of these agents, was initially used in high doses and was associated with adverse effects including proteinuria, skin rash and taste disturbance. We report 11 patients who developed side effects during captopril therapy (proteinuria two, rash four, taste disturbance four and taste disturbance with rash one) who were subsequently treated with enalapril, a second generation angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. Proteinuria did not recur in either patient, skin rash resolved in all five cases and taste disturbance resolved in four of five during enalapril therapy. We conclude that the side effects of proteinuria, skin rash and taste disturbance are consequences of captopril idiosyncrasy rather than inhibition of the angiotensin converting enzyme. The reported incidence of these side effects with the current recommended dosage of captopril is low.", 
    "139": "High protein diets acutely elevate the glomerular filtration rate. To characterize this response we administered 1 g of protein/kg body weight as a beef steak meal to nine, healthy male subjects and measured glomerular filtration rate (inulin clearance), renal plasma flow (p-amino hippurate clearance), plasma renin activity, aldosterone and plasma and urinary catecholamines. The subjects ingested the meal on three separate days and were pretreated with either placebo, 50 mg indomethacin (to inhibit renal prostaglandin synthesis), or 10 mg enalapril (to inhibit angiotensin II synthesis). Following placebo treatment protein feeding significantly increased the glomerular filtration rate, from a pre-meal level of 101 +/- 7 ml/min/1.73 m2 to a post-meal level of 130 +/- 6 ml/min/1.73 m2, P less than 0.005. A parallel rise in renal plasma flow and a fall in renal vascular resistance were noted. Indomethacin pretreatment attenuated the increase in glomerular filtration rate following the protein meal, 105 +/- 6 ml/min/1.73 m2 pre-meal level to 118 +/- 4 ml/min/1.73 m2 post-meal, P greater than 0.1. Enalapril pretreatment had no significant effect on protein-induced glomerular hyperfiltration. Protein feeding following placebo increased plasma aldosterone concentration while the concentrations were unchanged in the studies where enalapril or indomethacin was administered. Protein feeding following placebo or indomethacin did not alter plasma renin activity while plasma renin activity rose following enalapril administration. Urinary norepinephrine excretion rose while plasma norepinephrine concentration was unchanged in all three study groups. A decrease in urinary dopamine excretion was also noted four hours after the protein meal was ingested.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "140": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity was examined in large arteries and veins of rats and found to be present in most of the arteries and to a lesser extent in the veins, except for the femoral vessels which showed higher ACE activity in the vein than in the artery. For the aorta and all its branches, ACE activity was higher in the aorta and its branches in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) than in age-matched normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY), with the exception of the hepatic, pulmonary and basilar arteries where the levels were similar for SHR and WKY. For the vena cava and brachial vein, ACE activity was also higher in SHR than WKY but for most other veins the activity was the same with the exception of the pulmonary vein where ACE activity was higher in WKY. The acute treatment of SHR with cilazapril, an ACE inhibitor (0.3 and 3 mg/kg orally, for 4h) decreased aortic blood pressure and ACE activity in arterial and venous mesenteric and renal vessels in a dose-dependent fashion. Cilazapril, at the threshold hypotensive dose, markedly decreased ACE activity in each pair of aortic segments, carotid, pulmonary, subclavian, brachial and femoral vessels to a degree which was equivalent to that caused by the high dose. The effect outlasted a fall in blood pressure 24 h later. This was associated with a marked decrease in plasma angiotensin II and III and accumulation of angiotensin 1 at 4 h. No increase in plasma bradykinin or kallidin levels was detected.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "141": "Few studies exist on the interaction of diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with chronic heart failure. Twelve subjects with heart failure were studied before and after their usual oral dose of frusemide in random order on consecutive days during fixed sodium, potassium and water intake. Patients then received 10 mg day-1 of enalapril for 5 days and subsequently restudied before and after their usual dose of frusemide. Frusemide was not observed to have an effect on systemic or renal haemodynamics prior to enalapril, but urine volume and sodium content rose as expected. Treatment with enalapril, in the absence of frusemide, was associated with a fall in mean blood pressure from 89 +/- 5 mmHg to 85 +/- 4 mmHg (P less than 0.02) and a rise in renal blood flow from 424 +/- 202 ml min-1 to 494 +/- 225 ml min-1 (P less than 0.02), but cardiac output and glomerular filtration rate were again unchanged. Addition of frusemide to enalapril therapy resulted in a greater fall in mean blood pressure (87 +/- 5 mmHg to 79 +/- 4 mmHg; P less than 0.01) and an increase in cardiac output (3.1 +/- 1.1 l min-1 to 3.6 +/- 1.0 l min-1; P less than 0.02). Renal blood flow increased further than after enalapril alone to 579 +/- 211 ml min-1, but the glomerular filtration rate fell to 63 +/- 26 ml min-1 (P less than 0.01) and the filtration fraction fell to 19 +/- 5% (P less than 0.001). Weight gain occurred and the diuretic response to frusemide was reduced during this early phase of enalapril therapy.", 
    "142": "The prevalence of heavy alcohol consumption is a major problem of increasing proportions throughout the world. Although alcohol sensitizing drugs and more recently serotonin uptake inhibitors are drug interventions with some following, their long term beneficial consequences have yet to be demonstrated. In recent years, we have demonstrated that manipulating activity in the renin-angiotensin system will dramatically alter voluntary alcohol consumption in rats. Based on these findings, the present study evaluated the ability of a class of drugs known as the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors to reduce voluntary alcohol drinking in laboratory animals. These drugs prevent the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. They have been licensed for use in Europe and North America and are indicated in the treatment of hypertension. Our experiments showed that both captopril (Capoten, Squibb) and enalapril (Vasotec, Merck Sharpe & Dohme) can reduce alcohol drinking in both normotensive and hypertensive animals regardless of whether the pattern of intake is in a bout or of a less exaggerated nature. Furthermore, this change in alcohol intake can occur without concomitant changes in blood pressure, plasma renin activity, overall fluid balance, or the distribution and metabolism of alcohol. Taken together these findings suggest that the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors should be evaluated in a clinical setting for they may prove to be a useful new treatment or treatment adjunct for alcohol abuse in humans.", 
    "143": "High-affinity binding sites for angiotensin II (Ang II) in the ventrolateral medulla suggest that Ang II may act at cell groups that are known to modulate blood pressure. This hypothesis was investigated by the topical application of angiotensin I (Ang I), Ang II, the Ang II antagonist [Sar1, Thr8]Ang II, and the Ang I converting enzyme inhibitor MK 422 to a restricted region of the ventral medullary surface known as the glycine-sensitive area. Both Ang I (100 pmol) and Ang II (100 pmol) produced significant (p less than 0.01) increases in blood pressure (+20 +/- 4 and +31 +/- 5 mm Hg, respectively) that were associated with no change in heart rate. Furthermore, the relationship between the peak increases in blood pressure and Ang II was dose-dependent. Blockade of endogenous Ang II by [Sar1, Thr8]Ang II (13 nmol) produced a significant decrease in baseline blood pressure (-8 +/- 1 mm Hg; p less than 0.001). Similarly, topical application of MK 422 prevented the pressor effect of Ang I. Taken together, these experiments indicate that at least some components of the renin-angiotensin system exist in the ventrolateral medulla and they may modulate vasomotor outflow.", 
    "144": "The concentrations of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity, norepinephrine, and serotonin were measured in microdissected regions of the dog's brainstem and spinal cord. In addition, we determined the in vitro metabolism of 125I-angiotensin I (Ang I) in homogenates of the same brain punch regions. High ACE-specific activity was found in the monoamine-containing regions of the brainstem and in the intermediolateral column of the spinal cord. In brainstem homogenates 125I-Ang I was metabolized to angiotensin II (Ang-[1-8]) and the N-terminal heptapeptide Ang-(1-7). In the presence of MK 422 (50 microM), Ang-(1-7) was still generated, while the production of Ang-(1-8) was inhibited. This study revealed the presence of high ACE activity in monoamine regions of dog brainstem and spinal cord, and showed that the metabolite Ang-(1-7) is the major product generated from Ang I in the presence and absence of ACE inhibition.", 
    "145": "The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of chronic blockade of the brain renin-angiotensin system on the hormonal response to stress in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). To this end, we measured changes in plasma corticosterone, vasopressin, plasma renin activity, aldosterone, norepinephrine, and epinephrine in SHR treated with a 4-week intracerebroventricular infusion of captopril (osmotic minipump, 1.25 micrograms/hr) or vehicle in response to cold stress (4 degrees C x 4 hours) or ether stress (5 minutes). Within the fourth week of treatment, the average systolic blood pressure of captopril-treated SHR was significantly lower than that of vehicle-treated rats. Basal plasma levels of corticosterone, but not vasopressin, were significantly lower in SHR treated with captopril. In response to cold stress, captopril-treated SHR showed significantly lesser increases in both corticosterone and vasopressin than did vehicle-treated SHR. There were no differences in basal plasma levels of norepinephrine, epinephrine, plasma renin activity, or aldosterone between captopril-treated and vehicle-treated SHR, and both groups showed elevations of a similar magnitude after exposure to cold. In response to ether stress, captopril-treated SHR also showed significantly smaller increases in corticosterone and vasopressin than did vehicle-treated SHR. These results suggest that chronic intracerebroventricular administration of captopril, through blockade of the brain renin-angiotensin system, alters the hormonal response of SHR to stress.", 
    "146": "This study was designed to assess whether the acute blood pressure response of an individual hypertensive patient to a calcium antagonist or an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor is a good predictor of the long-term efficacy of these drug classes in this particular patient. The concept that good responses to ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists may be mutually exclusive was also tested. Sixteen patients were included in a randomized crossover trial of enalapril, 20 mg daily, and diltiazem, 120 mg daily, for 6 weeks each. Blood pressure was measured by ambulatory blood pressure recording. During the washout phase, the acute effect of nifedipine, 10 mg p.o., and enalaprilat, 5 mg i.v., was evaluated. Nifedipine and enalaprilat reduced blood pressure equally well. The long-term blood pressure reduction induced by enalapril and diltiazem was similar. The acute blood pressure response to a given drug was not a good predictor of the result obtained with long-term therapy. No age dependency of the antihypertensive effect of either drug class was apparent. There was no evidence that a good response to one drug excluded a similarly good response to the other.", 
    "147": "We studied the effect of converting enzyme inhibition with enalapril on the natriuresis observed after administration of atrial natriuretic factor (human ANF-[99-126], given as a 100-micrograms bolus i.v. injection) in eight healthy humans consuming a 100 mmol sodium diet. Without enalapril, sodium excretion rose from 127 +/- 19 (mean +/- SE) to 437 +/- 103 mumol/min in the first 20 minutes after ANF was administered. Clearance studies performed during maximal water diuresis indicated a rise in glomerular filtration rate (inulin clearance), free water clearance, phosphate, lithium, uric acid, and magnesium excretion. Four days of enalapril (20 mg b.i.d.) increased effective renal plasma flow (p-aminohippurate clearance) and reduced blood pressure (from 114/71 +/- 2/2 to 105/60 +/- 2/1 mm Hg). Under these conditions baseline sodium excretion was not different from the control study, but it rose less after ANF (from 117 +/- 22 to 242 +/- 63 mumol/min), and the increments in glomerular filtration rate, free water clearance, phosphate, lithium, uric acid, and magnesium were all blunted and nonsignificant. In addition, effective renal plasma flow tended to fall; this effect was not observed when ANF was given without enalapril. These results support the notion that the effects of ANF on renal hemodynamics and on tubular sodium handling depend on renal angiotensin II and that blood pressure reduction may interfere with the ANF-induced natriuresis.", 
    "148": "Angiotensin II elicits contractile responses in the coronary arteries and myocardial tissue, which suggests that blockade of the renin-angiotensin system by specific agents should lead to both coronary vasodilation and an alteration of left ventricular inotropism. The present work was designed to delineate--independently from its systemic effects--the intrinsic actions of an angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitor on the coronary circulation and left ventricular function. To minimize peripheral effects, a bilateral intracoronary infusion of enalaprilat (0.05 mg.min-1, 1 ml.min-1 in each coronary artery) was performed in 16 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. All patients had normal coronary arteriograms. In 12 patients (group I) the intracoronary infusion of enalaprilat resulted in minimal peripheral changes, with a 5% reduction in the mean aortic pressure (p less than .05) and no significant alteration in indexes of preload, i.e., left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and volume, or of afterload, i.e., left ventricular end-systolic stress and systemic resistances. Myocardial oxygen consumption was also unaffected by the intracoronary infusion of enalaprilat. Coronary vasodilation was demonstrated by a significant elevation of coronary sinus blood flow (+19%, from 181 +/- 73 to 214 +/- 79 ml.min-1, p less than .001) and a reduction of coronary resistance (-18%, from 0.51 +/- 0.17 to 0.41 +/- 0.15 mm Hg.ml-1.min, p less than .001), with a parallel increase in coronary sinus oxygen content and pressure (both p less than .05). Oxygen extraction by the myocardium was reduced (p less than .01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "149": "The antihypertensive effects and pharmacokinetic properties of cilazapril, a long-acting angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, were investigated in hypertensive patients with normal renal function (NRF; n = 5) and those with impaired renal function (IRF; n = 7). A 1.25-mg dose of cilazapril was administered orally once a day for 5 or 8 days. Measurement of blood pressure and sampling of blood specimens were done on the first and last days of treatment. Cilazapril induced significant falls in systolic and diastolic blood pressures as early as 1 h after administration. The antihypertensive effects were still present at 24 h postdose. Serum ACE activity was markedly suppressed over 24 h, with the enzyme inhibition greater in the IRF group. Plasma levels of the active diacid in the IRF group were higher than those in the NRF group, with significant differences in the peak levels and areas under the curve (AUC). A significant inverse correlation was found between the creatinine clearance and the AUC for the diacid. Cilazapril was well tolerated by all the patients, and no adverse reactions were observed. These results suggest that cilazapril has a long-lasting action and that it is a useful antihypertensive agent for controlling blood pressure in patients with either NRF or IRF.", 
    "150": "The antihypertensive activity of cilazapril, a new nonsulfhydryl angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor was evaluated in 20 outpatients (13 women, 7 men; mean age, 49 +/- 2.4 years) with mild to moderate essential hypertension, by means of an open dose-finding study of 10 weeks' duration. Cilazapril, 0.5 mg/day, was given, and the dose increased up to 10 mg/day if sitting diastolic blood pressure (SDBP) was not normalized (less than or equal to 90 mm Hg). Blood pressure measurements were carried out every 2 weeks before and 2 h after dosing. Predose and 2-h postdose measurements of plasma renin activity (PRA), angiotensin II (AII), plasma aldosterone (PA), and enzyme converting activity (ECA) were performed on the 1st day of active treatment and after 2 weeks of therapy. The SDBP decreased from 107.6 +/- 2 to 97.2 +/- 3 mm Hg 2 h after the initial dose (p less than 0.01). At the same time, ECA was inhibited 84.2 +/- 5% (p less than 0.01), AII decreased from 21.2 +/- 3 to 13.6 +/- 2 pg/ml (p less than 0.05), and PA from 208 +/- 29 to 119 +/- 14 pg/ml (p less than 0.01). After 2 weeks of therapy, ECA remained markedly reduced, by 68 +/- 6%, 24 h after the preceding cilazapril dose (p less than 0.01). The mean SDBP decreased from baseline to the end of treatment by 14.6 +/- 3 mm Hg (p less than 0.01). Cilazapril seems to be an effective antihypertensive drug which exerts potent and long-lasting ACE inhibition.", 
    "151": "We tested the effects of the neutral metalloendopeptidase (NEP) inhibitor, thiorphan (0.17, 0.5, and 1.7 mg i.v), and the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, captopril (0.5, 1.7, and 5.0 mg i.v.), on the bronchoconstrictor response to rapid intravenous infusions of substance P (0.1 to 30 nmol/kg) in anesthetized, mechanically ventilated guinea pigs. The decreases in pulmonary conductance and dynamic compliance caused by substance P were greater in animals treated with either thiorphan or captopril than in control animals. Thiorphan (0.5 mg) had no effect on airway responsiveness to intravenously administered methacholine, whereas captopril (1.7 mg) caused a small increase in methacholine responsiveness. Both drugs significantly increased the recovery of immunoreactive substance P in arterial plasma after exogenous administration of the peptide. We conclude that degradation of substance P by both NEP and ACE is important for determining the magnitude of the bronchoconstriction caused by intravenous administration of this neuropeptide. These data suggest that conditions associated with diminished peptidase activity could result in enhanced responses to stimuli which cause the release of endogenous substance P.", 
    "152": "Hypertension certainly accelerates the age-related changes in renal structure and function, mainly in the glomerulus. Both sodium handling and the renin-angiotensin system are involved in the aging process. Among the available classes of antihypertensive agents, the eventual deterioration of renal function induced by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in bilateral stenosis and stenosis of a single functioning kidney suggests that changes in glomerular pressure may participate in the changes of renal function. In essential hypertension and other conditions, it is possible that at a certain stage an increase in intraglomerular capillary pressure plays a role in the acceleration of the loss in renal function. As a consequence, it is proposed that in treating hypertension we should aim at reducing systemic blood pressure together with an attempt to reduce intraglomerular pressure using agents that act predominantly on post-glomerular resistance in order to have renal protection.", 
    "153": "The effects of indapamide and captopril on office and ambulatory blood pressure control and on general well-being were investigated in 30 active, randomly selected patients from 25 to 68 years old, with mild to moderate essential hypertension (diastolic blood pressure, 92 to 114 mm Hg). Twenty-four-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring using an ICR model 5200 portable recorder and evaluation of general well-being were performed prior to and at the end of three months of therapy with indapamide 2.5 mg given once daily, or captopril 12.5 to 50 mg given twice daily. Indapamide and captopril were equally effective in controlling blood pressures in clinic and during 24-hour activities. Although general well-being and subjective symptomatology improved with both treatments, the only significant difference between the two drugs was improvement in the sleep dysfunction scale with indapamide (p less than 0.02). The results shown in this study suggest that both indapamide (2.5 mg) once daily and captopril (12.5 to 50 mg) twice daily are suitable drugs for initial therapy of active patients with mild to moderate hypertension. A fixed once-daily dosage of an antihypertensive agent may, however, increase patient compliance and convenience.", 
    "154": "This multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study compares the effects of captopril treatment with those of digoxin treatment during maintenance diuretic therapy in patients with mild to moderate heart failure. Compared with placebo, captopril therapy resulted in significantly improved exercise time (mean increase, 82 s vs 35 s) and improved New York Heart Association class (41% vs 22%), but digoxin therapy did not. Digoxin treatment increased ejection fraction (4.4% increase) compared with captopril therapy (1.8% increase) and placebo (0.9% increase). The number of ventricular premature beats decreased 45% in the captopril group and increased 4% in the digoxin group in patients with more than ten ventricular premature beats per hour. Treatment failures, increased requirements for diuretic therapy, and hospitalizations were significantly more frequent in patients receiving placebo compared with those receiving either active drug. Transitory hypotension occurred more frequently with administration of captopril. Captopril treatment is significantly more effective than placebo and is an alternative to digoxin therapy in patients with mild to moderate heart failure who are receiving diuretic maintenance therapy.", 
    "155": "The hemodynamic effects of platelet activating factor (PAF), PAF antagonists and a precursor of PAF, 1-palmityl-2-acetyl-glycerol (PAG), were examined in pentobarbital-anesthetized spontaneously hypertensive rats to determine whether functionally significant amounts of PAF are produced via the cholinephosphotransferase pathway of PAF synthesis in vivo. Intravenous bolus doses of PAF, PAG and nitroprusside elicited hypotension and active mesenteric vasodilatation. Responses to PAG were slower in onset and longer in duration than those of PAF and nitroprusside. The specific PAF antagonists, CV-3988 and SRI 63-675, attenuated PAG- and PAF-, but not nitroprusside-induced changes in blood pressure and mesenteric flow/resistance. In contrast, captopril, which blocked the effects of angiotensin I, did not influence the hypotension caused by PAG, PAF and nitroprusside. The results suggest that the vasodilator effects of PAG are attributable to PAF produced from this alkylacetylglycerol, and the renin-angiotensin system does not appear to influence the biotransformation of PAG to PAF or the hypotensive action of PAF.", 
    "156": "The purpose of the present study was to test the vasomotor effect of angiotensin I (A I) and angiotensin II (A II) in feline cerebral arteries and to examine the presence of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity in the vessel wall and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). A II (10(-8) -10(-5) M) induced concentration-dependent contractions of feline pial arteries (resting diameter, 98-286 microns) in situ with a maximum of 34% at 10(-4) M A II. A I produced dose-related contractions being approximately 20 times less potent than A II. The action of A I was significantly attenuated by the ACE inhibitor captopril (10(-5) M). These findings demonstrate the presence of ACE activity in the vessel wall and/or its surroundings. ACE activity was also found in feline CSF sampled from the cisterna cerebellomedullaris. Bradykinin (BK) was broken down and A I converted to A II by CSF, both effects being inhibited by captopril. This was demonstrated using bioassay and high-performance liquid chromatography. Considering the present and previous studies we conclude that the presence of ACE in the vessel wall and CSF is necessary for the conversion of A I to A II. Although ACE in CSF is able to degrade BK it appears not to be important for the metabolism of BK acting from the perivascular side of pial arteries in situ.", 
    "157": "The hydrolysis of substance P by membrane peptidases prepared from the rat substantia nigra was studied in the presence of selective inhibitors. Substance P degradation by synaptic and mitochondrial membranes was completely inhibited by 1,10-phenanthroline (1 mM), a non-specific metallopeptidase inhibitor. Captopril and bestatine, selective inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme and aminopeptidases respectively, were without effects. However, phosphoramidon (1 microM), a putative 'enkephalinase' inhibitor, selectively inhibited substance P degradation by synaptic membranes. These results suggest that a phosphoramidon-sensitive endopeptidase may be the principal enzyme responsible for substance P degradation in substantia nigra.", 
    "158": "Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors cause cough in some patients, but the mechanism of this effect is not known. Six patients in whom these inhibitors had caused cough and a further two patients in whom they were suspected to have caused worsening of bronchial asthma were studied. Nine patients in whom angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors had not been associated with cough served as controls. In the controls lung function and bronchial reactivity were measured once; for the study patients these and the cough index were measured twice before rechallenge for two weeks with an angiotensin enzyme inhibitor and once afterwards. Rechallenge with drug for two weeks caused a significant decrease in the mean concentration of histamine causing a 35% fall in airways conductance and a significant increase in the cough index. Patients with cough showed bronchial hyperactivity compared with the controls, which increased after rechallenge with the inhibitors. Cough associated with converting enzyme inhibitors may be a variant of the cough in asthma.", 
    "159": "The properties of the various brain membrane peptidases capable of hydrolysing released neuropeptides are reviewed, with particular emphasis on endopeptidase-24.11 and angiotensin converting enzyme. The substrate specificities of both enzymes are defined and their relative contribution to the degradation of tachykinins in vitro are considered. One approach to assessing the physiological roles of identified peptidases involves examining the protective effect of selective peptidase inhibitors on the degradation of peptides released from brain slices. This procedure has been applied to study the release of substance P-like immunoreactivity from slices of rat substantia nigra. Inhibition of endopeptidase-24.11, but not of angiotensin converting enzyme, produces a significant increase in recovery of substance P. The specificity and distribution of endopeptidase-24.11 would therefore not be inconsistent with a role in the physiological inactivation of tachykinins, as well as enkephalins. At peripheral sites, LHRH and atrial natriuretic peptide may be important substrates of the enzyme. The endogenous neuropeptide substrate(s) for striatal angiotensin converting enzyme remain unclear.", 
    "160": "An easy, analytically sound fluoroenzymatic assay for angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors is described. Drug samples and standards are extracted with methanol and evaporated to dryness. Drug residues are then incubated with the substrate N-benzyloxycarbonyl-phenyllanyl-l-histidyl-leucine and human plasma ACE at 37 degrees C, pH 7.65, for 1 h. Fluorescence of the o-phthaldialdehyde derivatized product is measured at wavelengths of 365 nm (excitation) and 490 nm (emission). A computer program converts fluorescence to percent of ACE activity inhibited and correlates this percent inhibition with drug concentration. The ester prodrug enalapril (MK-421) was measurable at levels of a 1 ng ml(-1) in serum after base hydrolysis to enalaprilat. Lowest reliable detection limits for enalaprilat (MK-422) and lisinopril (MK-521) in serum were 0.7 ng ml(-1). This method is easily adapted to most other ACE inhibitors, is well suited to automation and avoids the use of radioactivity.", 
    "161": "Angiotensin II (Ang II) induces a marked reduction in renal blood flow at doses well below those required to induce a pressor response, and as blood flow falls there is a decline in glomerular filtration rate and sodium excretion. This striking sensitivity of the renal blood supply led many workers to consider the possibility that angiotensin functions as a local renal hormone. As angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) was found in particular abundance in the lung, it seemed reasonable to suspect that most of the conversion occurred there, and that the function of Ang II would be primarily systemic, rather than intrarenal. In this review, I will explore the evidence that has accumulated on these two possibilities, since they have important implications for our current understanding of normal kidney function and derangements of kidney function in disease.", 
    "162": "Male Munich-Wistar rats were subjected to 1 2/3 nephrectomy. One group received no therapy (C). A second group received daily doses of methylprednisolone (MP). A third group received MP plus the angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI) benzazepril. A fourth group received CEI alone. Half of the rats in each group underwent micropuncture study 2 weeks after ablation. Untreated rats exhibited systemic hypertension and elevation of the single nephron glomerular filtration rate (SNGFR), due to glomerular capillary hyperperfusion and hypertension. Administration of MP resulted in comparable systemic hypertension with further elevation of SNGFR due to even higher values for glomerular perfusion and hydraulic pressure (PGC). Concurrent treatment with CEI-controlled systemic and glomerular hypertension despite equivalent renal ablation and comparable doses of MP. After 12 weeks untreated rats demonstrated continued systemic hypertension, progressive proteinuria, and eventual glomerular sclerosis. Addition of MP dramatically accelerated the development of proteinuria and glomerular sclerosis, while CEI afforded striking protection against disease progression. Thus, potent vasodilator glucocorticoids may amplify hemodynamically mediated glomerular injury, whereas control of systemic and glomerular hypertension prevents this undesirable consequence of chronic steroid therapy.", 
    "163": "The potential effect of cimetidine on the pharmacokinetic profiles of quinapril and its active metabolite CI-928 was evaluated in eight healthy volunteers. Each subject received a single 40-mg quinapril dose on days 1 and 12 and cimetidine 300 mg four times daily on days 8 through 13. Serial blood and urine samples were collected for assay of quinapril and CI-928 concentrations. No statistically significant differences were observed in quinapril or CI-928 Cmax, tmax, AUC(0-infinity), beta, or percent of dose excreted in urine values for quinapril administered alone and in combination with cimetidine. Therefore, multiple-dose cimetidine administration does not influence the single-dose pharmacokinetics of quinapril and its active metabolite, CI-928, in healthy volunteers.", 
    "164": "Rats were fed 100 microM AlCl3 for 1 year in their drinking water, then killed and their brains homogenized in 0.1 M Tris (pH 7.4). The 800 g supernatants were assayed for Al3+ and the activities of acetylcholine esterase (ACE), hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH). The concentrations of Al in the homogenates, as computed on the original brain for the control and Al fed group were 40 ng and 80 ng/g wet wt, respectively. The activity of ACE was the same in both groups but that of hexokinase and G6PDH in the Al-fed group was about 73% and 80%, respectively, of the control. Dialysis restored the G6PDH but increased the hexokinase of the control group 2-fold and that of Al-fed group 2.7-fold. Thus at this elevated level it was same in both groups. The contribution of Al from the undialysed homogenates during assay was too low to account for the inhibition. It is therefore suggested that a dialyzable inhibitor for hexokinase is normally present in the brain and that Al feeding increases its concentration to further inhibit the utilization of glucose.", 
    "165": "The synthesis of a series of orally active, phosphinyloxyacyl proline inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is described. The in vitro and in vivo ACE inhibitory activities are reported for each compound. The structure-activity relationship for this series of compounds in relation to the carboxyalkyl dipeptide ACE inhibitors as well as other types of hydroxyphosphinyl-containing ACE inhibitors (e.g., the corresponding nitrogen and carbon isosteres) is discussed. Within an isosteric series of phosphorus-containing inhibitors based on the lysylproline terminal dipeptide sequence, only the phosphonates (oxygen isosteres) show a high level of oral activity. Optimum potency and oral activity in the phosphonate series occurs with the (phenylbutyl)- and n-hexylphosphonate side chains. An aminobutyl side chain in the P1' residue is an absolute requirement for full expression of oral activity. The most potent of these compounds, 8b (SQ 29,852), has intravenous and oral activities superior in potency to those of captopril in the normotensive rat.", 
    "166": "The possible acantholytic property of captopril and thiopronine has been investigated using in vitro tissue cultures. Normal human breast skin explants have been cultured in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 40% normal inactivated human serum with the addition of L-cysteine, or reduced glutathione (GSH), or captopril, or thiopronine, at four different concentrations (1, 5, 10, 15 mM). Patterns of diffuse, mainly suprabasal acantholysis, with formation of bullae, were observed in the skin explants cultured with captopril or thiopronine at a 15-mM concentration after 5 days of culture; intraepidermal splits were present also at a 10-mM concentration. Focal acantholysis was seen in specimens cultured with L-cysteine or GSH at a 15-mM concentration. No lesions occurred in the samples treated with lower concentrations of the above substances, nor in controls. The results show a biochemical acantholytic potential of both captopril and thiopronine, resembling that of penicillamine in similar experimental conditions, and consonant with clinical observations of pemphigus induced by drugs containing thiol groups in their molecule (SH drugs).", 
    "167": "Oral treatment of female NZB/NZW F1 hybrid mice with captopril prevented the development of proteinuria and prolonged survival in mice demonstrating slight (trace to 1+) proteinuria. Captopril treatment also markedly reduced the incidence and magnitude of proteinuria and prevented death in mice showing significant (3+ or greater) proteinuria. Histopathological studies of the kidneys of treated mice further demonstrated improvements in the renal lesions of autoimmune mice. The mechanisms whereby captopril treatment influences the course of disease in NZB/NZW mice are not known.", 
    "168": "Captopril (12.5-25 mg b.d.) was compared with placebo in a double-blind, cross-over study in elderly, hypertensive subjects. Sixteen patients, aged between 65 and 80 years, were studied. The mean baseline blood pressure off treatment was 204.7 +/- 24.5/111.8 +/- 11.1 mmHg. In the 14 patients who completed the study, captopril significantly reduced the systolic and diastolic pressures compared with baseline (P less than 0.001) and compared with placebo (P less than 0.01). The fall in blood pressures was significantly greater at 4 weeks than at 2 weeks (P less than 0.001). No significant change in blood pressure was noted from baseline whilst on placebo. No significant serious side-effects were encountered during the study. We conclude that captopril would appear to be an effective antihypertensive agent which can be safely used in the elderly.", 
    "169": "Single intraperitoneal (ip) injections of angiotension II (ANG II) stimulated water intake for 60 min in a dose-related manner in the goldfish, Carassius auratus. Single ip injections of captopril (SQ14225), an angiotension I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, at lower doses (0.4 and 4.0 micrograms/fish), stimulated water intake for 60 min. This stimulation cannot be ascribed to an increase in levels of plasma ANG I, since ANG I (2.2 micrograms/fish) did not stimulate drinking in the presence of SQ14225 (two injections of 9.9 micrograms/fish). It is suggested that the elevated plasma ANG I concentration achieved after blockade of ACE was converted into ANG II approximately 50 min after SQ14225 injections (4.0 g/fish), when the injected SQ14225 was effectively metabolized. Thus, the newly elevated level of ANG II may have been responsible for the vigorous drinking. Higher doses of SQ14225 (40 and 200 microgram/fish) did not affect the water intake for 60 min, indicating that the rate of basal water intake is independent of the renin-angiotensin system in the goldfish.",

It produced a marked hypotensive effect in SHR only. Cardiac output and circulating blood volume were similar in intact and experimental animals, NR and SHR alike. Captopril considerably increased plasma renin activity in NR and SHR.", 
    "171": "Components of the renin-angiotensin system (plasma renin activity, total and inactive renin, angiotensinogen and angiotensin II) were examined in 90 patients with labile and stable essential hypertension before and after functional and pharmacologic tests. New data have been obtained on intrasystemic regulatory mechanisms of the pressor renin-angiotensin systems. Different patterns of plasma active and inactive renin variations in response to salt loading are demonstrated in patients with different \"renin\" variants of essential hypertension. Angiotensin II is shown to have a stimulating effect on angiotensinogen synthesis.", 
    "172": "MRL lpr/lpr (MRL/l) mice exhibit a disease similar to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in humans. To investigate the influence of antihypertensive treatment on this disease, four groups of MRL/l mice were treated with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (n = 25), with the sympathetic blocker bretylium (n = 15), and with cyclophosphamide (n = 10). Thirty-five mice did not receive any treatment and served as controls. Survival rate, blood pressure, incidence of proteinuria and hematuria, renal pathology, lymphoid hyperplasia and dermatitis were studied. The survival at the age of 36 weeks was significantly improved by captopril as compared to controls (60 vs. 25%, p = 0.035). The cyclophosphamide group showed no mortality at that time and the bretylium group did not differ from the control group. Captopril and bretylium reduced systolic blood pressure significantly while cyclophosphamide was without effect. Captopril and cyclophosphamide diminished significantly the glomerular damage with less proliferative changes and a decreased incidence of proteinuria. The bretylium-treated animals also exhibited an improved renal pathology index but they did not differ from the controls with respect to proteinuria and hematuria. Lymphoid hyperplasia and dermatitis were decreased only by captopril and cyclophosphamide. It is concluded that captopril improves survival in SLE disease of MRL/l mice, counteracting lymphoid hyperplasia, renal disease, dermatitis and decreasing arterial blood pressure.", 
    "173": "In a randomized, cross-over study 27 patients had diastolic blood pressure of greater than or equal to 96 mmHg during four visits without treatment. Following captopril 25 mg b.i.d. nine patients' blood pressure was less than or equal to 90 mmHg. The remaining 18 were randomized into two treatment modalities, captopril and moderate dietary salt reduction, and captopril and hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily. Following a wash-out period the groups crossed over to the alternative treatment. At the end of the control period the average blood pressure was 151/100 +/- 12/6 mmHg recumbent and 140/91 +/- 11/7 standing, following captopril 144/94 +/- 13/5 and 132/92 +/- 12/6, respectively, with low salt diet added to captopril 140/91 +/- 12/6 and 128/89 +/- 11/6 and with hydrochlorothiazide and captopril 133/86 +/- 12/7 and 120/84 +/- 11/7 mmHg supine and erect, respectively. It is concluded that moderate dietary salt reduction, which is easily advised, will significantly potentiate the blood pressure fall following captopril treatment in moderate arterial hypertension.", 
    "174": "We studied the short-term hemodynamic effects of captopril in ten infants with congestive heart failure secondary to large left-to-right shunts who were refractory to routine medical management with digoxin and diuretics. During cardiac catheterization, captopril (0.5 to 1.0 mg/kg) was administered by nasogastric tube. For the entire group, mean systemic blood flow, pulmonary blood flow, and the pulmonary-to-systemic blood flow ratio did not change significantly after captopril administration. However, in the seven patients in whom baseline systemic vascular resistance was greater than 20 U/m2, captopril decreased the pulmonary-to-systemic blood flow ratio. In contrast, in the three patients in whom baseline systemic vascular resistance was less than 20 U/m2, captopril increased the pulmonary-to-systemic blood flow ratio. We conclude that captopril acutely decreases the pulmonary-to-systemic blood flow ratio in infants with large left-to-right shunts who have elevated systemic vascular resistance. Renal function must be monitored closely when using captopril.", 
    "175": "Three double-blind Veterans Administration Cooperative Studies are reviewed to determine age-related changes in response to antihypertensive agents. In the first study 312 patients received hydrochlorothiazide titrated from 25 to 100 mg twice daily to lower diastolic blood pressure (BP) to less than 90 mm Hg. Of 121 patients aged 55 to 65 the decrease in BP averaged -21.8/-12.9 mm Hg, while in the 191 patients younger than 55 the reduction averaged -15.7/-11.5 mm Hg (p less than 0.001; p = 0.048, respectively). Both systolic and diastolic BP reductions averaged significantly more in older whites; in older blacks it was systolic BP only. An additional 298 patients received titrated doses of propranolol alone. In this group there were no significant differences in BP response between younger patients and patients aged 55 to 65 except in the subgroup of white patients older than 60, in whom the systolic reduction was significantly less than in the younger patients. In a second study of bendroflumethiazide alone and with nadolol, systolic BP decreased more in older than in younger patients but there was no age-related reduction with nadolol alone. In the third trial captopril was first given alone and later with hydrochlorothiazide. There were no age-related differences with captopril alone, but after the addition of hydrochlorothiazide there was a trend toward a greater antihypertensive response in the patients aged 55 to 69. Thus, responsiveness of older patients varies with the type of antihypertensive drug. Age appears to increase the antihypertensive response to thiazide diuretics but not to beta-adrenergic blocking drugs or to captopril.", 
    "176": "Captopril administration has been shown to result in the release of prostaglandins (PGs) in experimental animals and patients. Also, PGs, particularly prostacyclin (PGI2), have been shown to stimulate left ventricular receptor reflexes. Thus, the hypothesis that captopril administration results in sensitization of left ventricular reflexes via increased circulating levels of PGs was tested in conscious instrumented dogs. Left ventricular reflexes were stimulated by injecting veratridine into the left circumflex coronary artery through a nonocclusive catheter. Under control conditions, injection of veratridine resulted in a decrease in mean arterial pressure of -25 +/- 4.7% from a base line of 97 +/- 4.7 mm Hg and a decrease in heart rate of -28 +/- 3.7% from a base line of 91 +/- 6.6 beats/min. After administration of captopril, veratridine injection resulted in a decrease in mean arterial pressure of -43 +/- 4.9% and a decrease in heart rate of -51 +/- 8.5%, both significantly greater effects than before captopril (P less than .05); N = 7). Subsequent administration of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin (5 mg/kg), in the presence of captopril reversed the potentiation of the response to veratridine. Thus, after indomethacin, injection of veratridine decreased mean arterial pressure -29 +/- 4.4% and decreased heart rate -28 +/- 4.1%; changes not significantly different from the control response. Similar findings were observed in a separate set of experiments in which heart rate was held constant by cardiac pacing (N = 6).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "177": "Stable prostaglandin analogs are known to induce lymphopenia and neutrophilia in a dose-dependent fashion after subcutaneous injection in rats. The purpose of the present investigation is to determine whether the prostaglandin-induced changes in circulating leukocytes might be secondary to hypotension with the ensuing release of adrenal hormones. The adrenal medullary catecholamine epinephrine was found to induce neutrophilia in both intact and adrenalectomized rats, and the glucocorticosteroid analog dexamethasone induced a profound lymphopenia in rats as reported by previous investigators. A stable analog of PGF2 alpha (15-S-15-methyl PGF2 alpha; M-PGF2 alpha) at the dose of 1 mg/kg induced marked systemic hypotension 1 h after injection, with lymphopenia and neutrophilia 6 h after injection. The non-prostanoid hypotensive agent captopril, at a dose of 63 mg/kg, induced a hypotension of similar magnitude and kinetics to that induced by prostaglandin. Captopril also induced lymphopenia and neutrophilia at 6 h, although the neutrophilia was of lesser magnitude than that induced by prostaglandins. The prostaglandin-induced lymphopenia was found to be mediated, at least in part, by the hypotension-induced release of adrenal hormones, as evidenced by the abrogation of lymphopenia in prostaglandin-treated adrenalectomized rats. Captopril-treated adrenalectomized rats, however, did develop a significant lymphopenia, suggesting that hypotension can result in lymphopenia even in adrenalectomized rats. The M-PGF2 alpha-induced neutrophilia in adrenalectomized rats, by comparison to captopril-induced neutrophilia in adrenalectomized rats, was greater than the neutrophilia expected as the result of hypotension alone. Indeed, the M-PGF2 alpha-induced neutrophilia in adrenalectomized rats was greater than the captopril-induced neutrophilia in sham-adrenalectomized rats. Thus, a portion of the neutrophilia induced by M-PGF2 alpha in intact rats may be mediated through adrenal-independent, hemodynamic-independent mechanisms. The possibility that M-PGF2 alpha might be inducing neutrophilia via an endotoxin-like stress reaction was investigated by examining changes in circulating white blood cells in intact and adrenalectomized C3H/HeN (endotoxin-sensitive) and C3H/HeJ (endotoxin-resistant) mice after prostaglandin administration. No quantitative differences in the prostaglandin-induced neutrophilia were noted in C3H/HeJ mice as compared to the C3H/HeN mice.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "178": "We have shown that heparin lowers blood pressure significantly in hypertensive rats. This study was initiated to examine whether prostaglandin (PG) mediates the antihypertensive action of heparin. To this end, the effect of three different PG synthesis inhibitors (indomethacin, aspirin, meclofenamate) on the cardiovascular and renal actions of heparin was studied in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). During 4 weeks of treatment, heparin reduced blood pressure significantly (P less than 0.01) in SHR. This was accompanied by significant decrements in hematocrit and total peripheral resistance but a significant increment in cardiac output. All of the PG inhibitors used significantly potentiated the antihypertensive effect of heparin and further reduced blood pressure by about 20%. Although heparin alone increased plasma renin activity, heparin and PG inhibitors together prevented this effect. When compared with heparin-treated rats, SHR treated with heparin and PG inhibitors combined had significantly (p less than 0.05 to 0.01) lower plasma aldosterone levels. These levels, however, were not different from SHR treated with PG inhibitors alone. Like blood pressures, the renal histopathologic lesions in SHR treated with heparin or heparin and PG inhibitors combined were significantly less severe than those in untreated SHR or SHR treated with PG inhibitors alone. Finally, captopril was shown to potentiate the effect of heparin. In conclusion, the antihypertensive effect of heparin does not appear to be PG mediated, but may be related to the structural changes in renal arterioles, inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme, or both.",

The anticoagulant activity of acenocoumarol was not affected by benazepril; there was an apparent slight but statistically significant reduction of the anticoagulant effect of warfarin. The magnitude of the inhibitory effect was considered not to be clinically important. There was no effect of benazepril on plasma steady-state levels of either anticoagulants.", 
    "181": "Cough is a well recognised though undesirable side effect during the course of treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (IEC). With the help of two examples we have tried to show that this cough does not have an immunological origin but rather pharmacological. Cough was suppressed by non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Stemming from these observations and from two studies in the literature a patho-physiological mechanism for the cough is proposed in which treatment with IEC leads to a connection with prostaglandins, notably bronchial PGE2.", 
    "182": "Hypoxia (10%-12% O2) preadaptation for 4-7 days effectively protects rats from oxygen toxicity. The present study was designed to investigate the hypothesis that the lung's microvascular endothelium shares in development of oxygen tolerance and therefore that endothelial metabolic function would be protected from oxygen toxicity by prior adaptation to hypoxia. Since pulmonary oxygen toxicity decreases lung capillary angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity, we assayed converting enzyme active sites in an isolated perfused rat lung preparation as a marker for the development of oxygen toxicity and tolerance. Rats were exposed to air, hypoxia (10% O2 for 4 days), hyperoxia (greater than 95% O2 for 2 days) alone, or hypoxia followed immediately by hyperoxia. Lung vascular ACE content was quantitated by measuring the single pass binding of an iodinated-converting enzyme inhibitor, 125I-MK351A, a derivative of lisinopril. Hypoxia adaptation per se had no effect on ACE content reflected in normal 125I-MK351A binding, whereas hyperoxia exposure caused a significant decrease in lung vascular ACE. Hyperoxia-induced decreases in ACE content were prevented partially by hypoxia adaptation, indicating that ACE content on luminal endothelial surfaces was protected from oxygen toxicity. In isolated perfused lungs 125I-MK351A binding reflects development of oxygen tolerance after hypoxia preadaptation and suggests that lung endothelial metabolic function is protected from oxygen toxicity.", 
    "183": "Single oral doses of 10 mg converting enzyme inhibitor benazepril (CGS 14824A) and 40 mg furosemide were administered to 12 healthy male volunteers either separately or concomitantly. The pharmacokinetic parameters of benazepril were not influenced by coadministration of furosemide. Urinary excretion of total furosemide was significantly reduced by 10 to 20% in the presence of benazepril. This effect was considered clinically insignificant. Erect blood pressure decreased and pulse rate increased only during concomitant treatment.", 
    "184": "Three techniques for deliberate hypotension (mean arterial pressure, 60 to 70 mmHg) were prospectively compared in adults undergoing posterior spine fusion. Patients received either IV sodium nitroprusside, sodium nitroprusside with oral captopril pretreatment, or IV nitroglycerin. Patient groups were comparable in age, sex, weight, baseline hemodynamic and laboratory parameters, duration of surgery, and duration of hypotension. Absolute blood loss was significantly less in the group receiving nitroglycerin; however, there were no differences between groups when corrected for operative exposure (milliliter per spine segment exposed). Nitroprusside was effective in producing target blood pressure in all patients. Nitroglycerin was ineffective in two patients and two other patients required greater than 20 micrograms/kg/min. Both groups receiving nitroprusside developed significant postinfusion increases in arterial pressure. Blood pressure fell significantly after induction of anesthesia in patients receiving captopril. Cardiac index, heart rate, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, intrapulmonary shunt, and arterial blood gases were comparable and did not change significantly in any group. Systemic vascular resistance fell during infusion in all groups and remained depressed after infusion in patients receiving nitroglycerin. Plasma renin activity was significantly increased in the group receiving captopril due to loss of feedback inhibition of renin release and rose significantly during infusion in those patients receiving nitroprusside alone. There were no complications. Nitroprusside with and without captopril pretreatment was associated with postoperative increases in arterial pressure, although not to hypertensive levels, probably due to loss of captopril activity after single-dose administration. The use of nitroglycerin was limited by lack of potency. There was no demonstrable clinical advantage for any of the three techniques.", 
    "185": "Ten patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) (NYHA II-IV) on adjusted doses of digitalis and diuretics underwent a careful clinical assessment including an evaluation of exertion dyspnoea and the usual echocardiographic indices of cardiac performance. A cardiopulmonary exercise test with an increment of 20W every 3 minutes was prolonged until exhaustion. Systemic arterial pressure, ECG, VO2, VCO2 and VE were monitored throughout. Gas tensions, plasma catecholamines and lactate were measured in blood samples taken at the first and third minute of each exercise stage. The above measurements were carried out before and after 3 months of treatment with Captopril, 50 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d. A highly significant correlation between arterial lactate and plasma norepinephrine (NE) was observed in each patient during both exercise tests (r = 0.77 to 0.99; p less than 0.05 at least). Left ventricular end-diastolic dimensions were reduced by Captopril (from 69.9 +/- 1.7 to 65.2 +/- 1.4 mm, p less than 0.01) along with a concomitant increase in percent fractional shortening. Most of the patients were reclassified at a lower NYHA class and a significant decrease in dyspnoea score was observed. The exercise time was significantly increased (from 11.2 +/- 1.8 to 12.9 +/- 1.9 min; p less than 0.05), but the peak values of NE, arterial lactate and VO2 were not affected by the treatment. The predicted value of VE at a VCO2 of 1 L/min, regarded as an index of dyspnoea, was significantly decreased by Captopril (from 41.4 +/- 2.9 to 38.9 +/- 2.7 L/min; p less than 0.05). The positive effects of long-term treatment with Captopril on cardiac performance in CHF are confirmed. Sympathetic activity is linked to anaerobic muscular metabolism during exercise and seems to be independent of pharmacological ACE inhibition. The discrepancy between the exercise tolerance and the peak VO2 might be explained by a better utilization of the available energy.", 
    "186": "The value of captopril-enhanced 99mTc DTPA scintigraphy as a screening test for renovascular disease was prospectively studied in 44 hypertensive patients suspected to have renal-artery stenosis. Renal impairment (plasma creatinine greater than 130 mumol/l) was present in 29 patients. At angiography 13 patients had unilateral stenosis, two bilateral stenosis, and 29 patients had no renovascular disease. Captopril induced a fall in split renal function in the kidney ipsilateral to the stenosis in all patients with unilateral disease (mean 52 +/- 23% to 44 +/- 21% of total renal function; P less than 0.001). A positive captopril scintigram (defined as a fall of 5% or more in split renal function) had a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 72% in the detection of unilateral renal-artery stenosis. Captopril-enhanced 99mTc DTPA scintigraphy is a promising non-invasive screening test for the detection of renal-artery stenosis.",

    "188": "Thiol angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (Captopril, CL242817) and collagen antagonists (D-penicillamine) partially prevent pulmonary hypertension in monocrotaline-treated rats. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether the nonsulfhydryl ACE inhibitors CGS13945 and CGS16617 also ameliorate monocrotaline-induced cardiopulmonary damage in rats consuming the drugs continuously for 6 weeks. D-penicillamine was tested concomitantly as a positive control. Monocrotaline-treated animals developed severe pulmonary histopathology occlusive wall thickening of the pulmonary arteries, adrenomegaly, cardiomegaly, and right heart enlargement. Concomitant administration of CGS13945, CGS16617, or penicillamine ameliorated most of these monocrotaline reactions. Monocrotaline-induced histopathologic changes in the lung were accompanied by pulmonary endothelial dysfunction, including suppressed ACE and plasminogen activator activity and increased prostacyclin and thromboxane production. None of the modifying agents influenced these functional abnormalities in monocrotaline-treated lung endothelium. Thus, the ACE inhibitors CGS13945 and CGS16617 ameliorate monocrotaline-induced cardiopulmonary damage in rats, indicating that the presence of a thiol group is not essential for this class of compounds to exhibit therapeutic activity against monocrotaline lung injury. The present data do not identify the mechanism of action of CGS13945 and CGS16617, but appear to rule out lung ACE inhibition and lung endothelial cell sparing as major therapeutic factors.", 
    "189": "Congestive heart failure is a serious health-care problem that is associated with a high mortality. Although drug therapy has been effective in reducing symptoms, until recently there has been little evidence of prolonged survival. Within the past few years, however, certain vasodilator therapies, when added to a conventional regimen, have demonstrated a positive effect on longevity. In patients with moderately severe to severe heart failure, the combination of isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine reduced mortality by 34%. In patients with severe heart failure, enalapril reduced one-year mortality by 31%. Captopril has also been shown to be effective in improving survival. In a recent analysis, the mortality rate of patients with moderately severe heart failure treated with captopril was 4% over three months, compared with 21% among placebo-treated patients. In a smaller study, 83% of captopril-treated patients, compared with 20% of hydralazine-treated patients, with moderately severe to severe heart failure survived for at least one year. The mechanisms through which captopril could potentially improve survival include hemodynamic, functional, structural, and neurohormonal variables.",

    "191": "The authors have compared the short-term effect of two captopril (ACE inhibitor) preparations namely the Lopirin (SQUIBB) and Tensiomin (EGIS) and dihydralazine as well as placebo in 15 patients with severe heart failure (NYHA III-IV, class). In case of 8 patients with NYHA IV, functional class the short-term effect of the combined therapy of dihydralazine and Lopirin and dihydralazine and Tensiomin as well dihydralazine and placebo have been compared. The underlying disease was dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and ischaemic heart disease (IHD). At the end of the treatment with different drugs and placebo the clinical signs of heart failure (complaints and physical status) and the echo and mechanocardiographic parameters of left ventricular function were assessed. The parameters, apart from the clinical signs, have been evaluated in double blind fashion. Compared to placebo all the three drugs i.e. dihydralazine, Lopirin as well as Tensiomin have decreased significantly the NYHA classes, influenced favorably the non-invasive parameters of left ventricular function and decreased blood pressure. As to the dihydralazine, it improved the left ventricular ejection function and the clinical state of the patients with DCM in a higher degree than the two ACE inhibitors did. The effect of Tensiomin and Lopirin was the same in every respect. Both have influenced more favourable the complaints and physical state of patients with IHD than dihydralazine has. The left ventricular filling pressure, the double product (heart rate x wall tension) indicating the myocardial oxygen demand were more reduced in their effect than in that of dihydralazine. Unlike dihydralazine both decreased the heart rate. Administering one of the two ACE inhibitors to the dihydralazine beneficial additive effects have been experienced; the NYHA classes, the heart rate, the left ventricular wall tension and the double product diminished. The authors, on the bases of the results, consider Tensiomin and Lopirin as equivalent in their effect. In their opinion the administration of these drugs mean a new, efficient way of therapy, first of all in cases of heart failure caused by IHD. In the most severe cases they suggest a trial with the combined dihydralazine-ACE inhibitor therapy.",

In 9 outpatients suffering from congestive cardiomyopathy the effect of Tensiomin as an adjuvant to digitalis, diuretic, vasodilator etc. was evaluated by non-invasive methods. During the 3-month follow-up period the heart rate was decreased and the PEP/LVET ratio was improved. The parameters calculated from the X-ray examination (cardiothoracic index, cardiac volume index) indicated the regression of cardiomegaly. Radioisotopic circulatory examinations (systolic volume index, cardiac output index) indicated an increase in cardiac performance. In addition to the significant changes of these parameters the patients' clinical state was also improved in all cases as assessed according to the NYHA classification. Significant side effects were not observed during the treatment.",

This action of captopril is accompanied by a favourable clinical effects, the improvement of the symptoms of heart failure and the increase of sodium and water excretion and the increase of serum potassium level.", 
    "194": "With a brief description of the physiological role of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in the regulation of blood pressure the most important clinicopharmacological aspects of the converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, is outlined. Hemodynamic and humoral effects, pharmacokinetics, indications, contraindications, dosage, side effects, drug interactions and usage in diagnostic procedures of captopril is described. The possibility of captopril therapy in children is also discussed.", 
    "195": "Combined Captopril treatment was applied in 61 patients with severe or moderately severe hypertension in patients insufficiently or not reacting to the usual combined antihypertensive therapy (3-7 kinds of drug). The combination included diuretics, beta-blockers, alpha-blockers, vasodilators, Ca-antagonists and centrally acting agents. Diuretics were used in all cases. Average duration of treatment was 8.2 months (i.e. 2-40 months). Mean systolic pressure prior to Captopril treatment was 202.4 mm Hg (S.D. +/- 27.6), while the diastolic 122.0 mm Hg (S.D. +/- 11.3). During combined Captopril treatment the average values were 154.2 mm Hg (S.D. +/- 18.8) and 97.6 mm Hg diastolic pressures (S.D. +/- 10.7), the difference being significant (p less than 0.001). Refractory hypertension occurred in three middle-aged female patients in response to combined Captopril treatments. Captopril treatment had to be discontinued for the appearance of side-effects (severe skin symptoms) only in a single case. A minor deterioration of renal functions was observed in three patients (in one bilateral renovascular, and in two essential hypertension). Serum creatinine value and renal functions of four patients showed significant improvement as a result of combined Captopril treatment. During combined Captopril treatments (also with a diuretic) two patients had so severe hypokalaemia that they needed potassium substitution or administration of a potassium-saving diuretic.", 
    "196": "Experience with the use of foreign (Capoten Lopirin; Squibb) and Hungarian (Tensiomin; EGIS) captopril preparations is reported. It was found that the first dose of captopril resulted in a larger blood pressure decrease in hypertensive patients with a high blood renin level. A linear correlation was observed between the blood renin level before treatment and the captopril induced blood pressure decrease following the first dose. Captopril monotherapy lowered the blood pressure effectively without significant pulse rate change in patients whose blood pressure was difficult to influence with combined treatment containing no captopril. This paper reports on the area of indications and side-effects of the drug.", 
    "197": "The effectiveness of captopril, the dose-response relationships, the influence of diuretics on the effective dose of captopril, the possible combinations of captopril with other antihypertensive agents as well as the clinical value of monotherapy and combined treatment have been investigated in 48 patients with hypertension. This paper summarizes the data obtained in the course of several special clinico-pharmacological studies during a 4 year period (1982-1986). Captopril proved to be an antihypertensive agent with a wide therapeutic spectrum. As a single agent it was used especially in geriatric cases. Of the antihypertensive agents, diuretics have been combined with captopril most frequently but it has been concurrently administered with practically all the other antihypertensive drugs. Captopril appeared to be a safe agent without significant side effects. An increase in serum potassium levels by captopril were seen not infrequently; its advantages, disadvantages, prevention and mechanisms have been dealt with in detail.", 
    "198": "DTPA functional renal camera scintigraphy (DTPA-FS) was performed in 220 patients with moderately severe and severe hypertension after an initial 7-14-day Captopril + thiazide-type diuretic treatment. If, comparing it with the DTPA-FS prior to treatment, appearance or increase of a side difference were observed and it was also indicated by the clinical picture, nephroangiography was performed. Using this method, 15 cases of unilateral, 3 bilateral renal arterial stenoses were recognized, and in one case restenosis was diagnosed, in all cases of positive DTPA-FS with Captopril. In negative case of DTPA-FS sensitized with Captopril, there was no positive angiographic finding. The method of DTPA-FS performed under Captopril effect is considered to be a simple, harmless, specific out-patient examination for screening genuine renovascular hypertension. To perform several angiographies likely to be negative can be avoided by this method. The hypotensive effect of Captopril may, at the same time, be a useful guide in differentiating patients with renovascular hypertension being suitable most of all for surgical intervention or angioplasty.", 
    "199": "The effect of captopril treatment on natural killer activity and mitogen-induced lymphocyte blastogenesis was studied in man. No significant change in immune reactivity was found either in short term (one hour after ingestion of 25 mg) or long term (after two weeks, 50 mg daily) treatment.", 
    "200": "Chronic effects of captopril were studied in 29 patients (age, 4 months to 16 years; mean, 6.9 years) suffering from digitalis and diuretic resistant congestive heart failure (CHF) or hypertension of different etiology. Twenty two patients with CHF (13 dilated, 4 restrictive cardiomyopathy, 5 congenital heart defects) and 7 cases with hypertension were treated for 1 to 31 months (mean, 9 months). The dose of captopril varied from 1 to 3 mg/kg/day (mean, 2.2 mg) in CHF and from 1.1 to 6.8 mg/kg/day (mean, 3.7 mg) in hypertension. In CHF digoxin therapy was maintained while the dose of diuretics could be reduced or discontinued. In 4 severely hypertensive patients the addition of a diuretic or beta blockers was necessary. In CHF clinical improvement was observed in 13 patients (59%), while there was no response in 4 and 5 patients died. The survivors exhibited a significant decrease of the cardiothoracic index (p less than 0.05), the PEP/LVET ratio (p less than 0.05) and an increase of the echocardiographic linear ejection fraction (p less than 0.001). If hypertension was present, blood pressure decreased in all patients (p less than 0.05). Captopril was well tolerated by all patients except one who developed anaemia. This side effect disappeared after having discontinued the drug. These findings suggest that captopril is of benefit in controlling chronic CHF. Captopril alone or in combination with other drugs is effective in the management of severe hypertension.", 
    "201": "The effect of oral Tensiomin treatment, 53.4 mg daily in 29 patients suffering from congestive heart failure associated with acute of chronic forms of ischaemic heart disease, e.g., recent and/or advanced myocardial infarction, aneurysm etc. was studied. The acute and long-term beneficial haemodynamic effects were verified in 4 patients by thermodilution Swan-Ganz catheterization as well. The parameters of ejection function improved moderately, while left ventricular filling pressure (PCW) decreased significantly. The balanced vasodilator effect was not accompanied by an increased myocardial oxygen demand. The \"double product\" was lowered in response to Tensiomin. During the clinical follow-up (from 6 days to 2 years) there was an improvement in the NYHA functional class by an average of 1.2 however 4 patients died in spite of combined vasodilator and dobutamine treatment. Owing to the improvement of regional blood flow to the brain and the kidney Tensiomin seems to be well-tolerated in patients with low arterial blood pressure. In pts with acute myocardial infarction and angina the critical fall of blood pressure and that of the coronary blood flow should be avoided by giving the drug in approximately titrated. Side effects were observed only with higher doses of Tensiomin in a small number of patients, i.e., transient worsening of renal function in 3 patients and dysgeusia in 2. Our data indicate that Tensiomin treatment is effective and safe in patients suffering from all kinds of congestive heart failure complicating ischaemic heart disease.", 
    "202": "The effect of captopril monotherapy on blood pressure and metabolism was investigated in a placebo-controlled study in 30 non-insulin dependent (Type II) diabetic subjects during a 3-week observation period (run-in/drug; placebo/wash-out) on a metabolic ward. Captopril significantly reduced both systolic and diastolic blood pressure (154/90 +/- 5/2 vs. 144/86 +/- 4/3 mmHg) without major side effects. Mean run-in postprandial blood glucose concentrations were also reduced upon ACE-inhibition (9 a.m.: 12.7 +/- 0.4 vs. 11.1 +/- 0.4 mmol/l; 1 p.m.: 11.0 +/- 0.3 vs. 8.9 +/- 0.3 mmol/l; P less than 0.05), while blood kinin concentrations (40.0 +/- 2.5 pmol/l) were approximately doubled (108.8 +/- 23.5 pmol/l; P less than 0.05). Body mass index, fasting plasma insulin, serum electrolyte pattern, uric acid, white blood count, lipid profile as well as hepatic and renal function parameters remained unaltered throughout the observation period. The data are in line with recent experimental studies showing a beneficial metabolic effect of captopril in Type II diabetes. ACE inhibitors might therefore become first-line drugs in early antihypertensive intervention in Type II diabetic patients.", 
    "203": "Thirty patients (21 F, 9 M) of mean age 55.3 years with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus of mean duration 10.8 years and hypertension (blood pressure 160/95 mm Hg) of 0.3 to 4.0 years were randomly allocated to either a twice daily regimen of captopril (50 mg twice daily, Group A) or a once daily captopril schedule (50 mg once daily, Group B). Good glycaemic control (HbA1c, mean 7.63%) had been achieved with sulphonylureas in 22 patients and insulin in 8 patients. There were no statistical differences in baseline values between the two groups. For the 15 patients in Group A, blood pressure fell significantly from a baseline of 177 +/- 13.2/106 +/- 7.8 mm Hg to 161 +/- 14.3/91 +/- 6.9 after one month (P less than 0.05) and continued to decrease at 3 and 6 months. In Group B the blood pressure changed from 179 +/- 19.0/110 +/- 15.6 to 169 +/- 21.0/98 +/- 7.2 at 1 month (P less than 0.05) with further reductions again seen at 3 and 6 months. Nine patients had poorer response than the other 21 but there were no demographic differences between these subgroups nor were there any differences in plasma renin activity or aldosterone responses. There were no statistically significant changes in haematological or biochemical values in either group during treatment. In particular, HbA1c and fasting glucose were unaffected by captopril treatment. No side effects were encountered during the 6 months of follow-up. In conclusion, captopril is an effective antihypertensive in non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus with mild to moderate hypertension and a once daily regimen could improve compliance.", 
    "204": "The effect of a six-week treatment by placebo, the calcium channel blocker nifedipine or the converting enzyme inhibitor captopril was assessed in normotensive patients with insulin-dependent diabetes and incipient nephropathy. In response to captopril and nifedipine, arterial pressure decreased slightly and to a similar extent. These drugs resulted in opposite effects on urinary albumin excretion (increase in urinary albumin excretion by 40% during nifedipine and decrease by 40% during captopril treatment). No change in urinary albumin excretion was observed in the placebo group. This observation of opposite changes in urinary albumin excretion in the presence of a similar fall in arterial pressure suggests that the effect of captopril and nifedipine on urinary albumin excretion results from some difference in their intrarenal action.", 
    "205": "Mean arterial pressure and three regional blood flows--renal, superior mesenteric, and hindquarter flows--were monitored in conscious normotensive control rats (NCR), in two-kidney, one-clip (two-kidney), and in one-kidney, one-clip (one-kidney) hypertensive rats. After administering captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, mean arterial pressure decreased in all three groups. However, lowering of arterial pressure was not statistically significant in any of the groups. Renal flow increased significantly in the intact artery of two-kidney hypertensive rats, whereas it did not significantly increase in the clipped artery of one-kidney hypertensive rats and in the intact artery of NCR. Superior mesenteric flow increased significantly only in one-kidney hypertensive rats. Hindquarter flow did not significantly change in the three groups. Regional resistance reduced significantly in not only renal but also in superior mesenteric vascular area in two-kidney hypertensive rats, whereas it did not reduce significantly in these two vascular areas in one-kidney hypertensive rats and in NCR. The present findings show that the renin-angiotensin-mediated vasoconstriction plays a role in not only renal but also in superior mesenteric vascular area in two-kidney hypertensive rats, whereas it hardly plays a role in these three vascular beds in one-kidney hypertensive rats.", 
    "206": "A total of 50 patients with essential hypertension, I-II stages, were investigated to study changes in peripheral and intracardiac hemodynamics and myocardial contractility in moderate restriction of sodium chloride in \"salt-sensitive\" patients (SSP). In such patients (84% of all examinees) with mild arterial hypertension moderate restriction of SC consumption causes a sufficient antihypertensive effect determined by considerable improvement of peripheral hemodynamic indices and improvement of myocardial pump function and contractility, and in patients with moderate and severe hypertension it potentiates an antihypertensive effect and influence of drug therapy on hemodynamics. In non-SSP moderate restriction in SC consumption was ineffective. A sufficient antihypertensive effect in them resulted from the use of drug therapy at higher dosage than in SSP.", 
    "207": "The arterial blood pressure (BP), the ratio between gram myocardial mass per 100 g body mass (R), the plasma renin activity (PRA) and the aldosteron content in the blood plasma (PA) were investigated in a model of renal hypertension, 30 days after the operation, in the following groups of male Wistar rats: operated and treated throughout the entire experimental period with captopril Pharmachim in a dose of 30 mg/kg body mass twice daily orally, and two control groups--operated and treated with saline, and non-operated animals of the same age, treated only with saline. BP, R and PA increase significantly in the control group with experimental hypertension. In the group treated with captopril PRA was more than doubled compared with the two control groups, with a considerable decrease in PA compared with the control group with hypertension. The results obtained for the captopril-treated experimental group (with the exception of PRA) are identical and close to the data for the control non-operated animals, i.e. the treatment of the experimental animals with captopril prevents the development of arterial hypertension and of myocardial hypertrophy with the coarctation hypertension model used.", 
    "208": "Essential hypertension is a heterogeneous spectrum of pathophysiologic disturbances, not a single entity. Identification and characterization of two different vasoconstrictor mechanisms--one renin-mediated, the other sodium-volume mediated--has made it possible not only to apply antihypertensive drug therapy on a more rational basis but to screen out a significant number of cases of curable (high-renin) renovascular disease as well as many cases of curable (low-renin) primary aldosteronism. An array of five major drug types makes long-term monotherapy for essential hypertension an achievable goal. Converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers counteract the renin-mediated vasoconstriction; diuretics, calcium-channel antagonists, and alpha-blockers oppose the low-renin sodium-volume-mediated form of vasoconstriction. This information brings us closer to the primary goal of modern therapy: to give each patient the fewest drugs in the smallest amounts and with the least frequency possible for the often lifetime commitment that antihypertensive therapy involves.", 
    "209": "Conformationally constrained phenylbutyl(hydroxyphosphinyl)acyl dipeptides are potent inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme. The activity enhancement obtained by introducing conformational constraint into these molecules is greater than for related sulfhydryl and carboxyl analogs. The results are interpreted in terms of a binding model which optimally positions both zinc binding and hydrophobic groups for active site binding.", 
    "210": "Hyperreninemic hypoaldosteronism was diagnosed in a 34-year-old woman with hypertension who was receiving captopril therapy. Renal biopsy revealed an advanced stage of IgA nephropathy, and her creatinine clearance was 40 ml/min. Elevation of serum potassium from 4.7 to 5.8 mEq/l and development of hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis with laboratory findings of pH 7.285, HCO3- 13.5 mEq/l, Na 141, and Cl 114 mEq/l were observed after captopril therapy. When captopril was withdrawn, elevated serum potassium levels and metabolic acidosis returned to normal. Challenge with captopril resulted in a decrease in plasma aldosterone levels, an increase in plasma renin activity, and development of hyperkalemic, hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis which is corrected with mineralocorticoid replacement. This case study demonstrates that captopril can cause hyperreninemic hypoaldosteronism with the laboratory finding of hyperkalemic, hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis.", 
    "211": "The response of the pulmonary circulation to captopril 75 mg has been examined in 21 patients with pulmonary hypertension secondary to mitral stenosis. The effects of captopril were measured every 15 min up to 2 h by recording pressures in the pulmonary and systemic circulations and by measuring cardiac output. Pulmonary artery systolic pressure fell significantly by 21.6% (from means = 54.6 to 42.8 mm Hg), pulmonary artery diastolic pressure by 23.3% (from 26.2 to 20.1 mm Hg), and the pulmonary artery mean pressure by 23.2% (from 36.9 to 28.3 mm Hg). Right ventricular end-diastolic pressure also fell significantly by 7% (8.1 to 7.5 mm Hg). Heart rate decreased by 6.5% (from 76.3 to 71.3 beats.min-1). Cardiac index and stroke volume index did not change. The total and vascular pulmonary resistance dropped significantly by 23.2% (from 721 to 553.7 dyn.s.cm-5) and 40% (from 287.2 to 172 dyn.s.cm-5), respectively. The right ventricular stroke work index fell by 33% (from 15.1 to 10.1 g/beat/m2). Systemic systolic pressure decreased by 10.5% (from 124.5 to 111.4 mm Hg). Thus, captopril lowered pulmonary pressures and resistances and no deterioration in right ventricular function was observed.", 
    "212": "Heart failure is difficult to define and quantify, and this makes it difficult to assess the relative value of different drug regimens. Although there are theoretical reasons suggesting that ACE inhibitors might be useful in all patients with heart failure, there are cogent arguments to the contrary. In practice, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been shown to given considerable relief to patients with severe heart failure, but in patients who are only moderately ill these drugs may have less effect than increasing the dose of diuretics. Vasodilators in general probably reduce the fatality of patients with heart failure, but the effect is not specific to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "213": "Vasodilators have gained widespread acceptance in the management of congestive heart failure. They produce prompt hemodynamic and clinical improvement in acute left ventricular failure, and in chronic congestive heart failure they also improve symptoms, functional capacity, and survival. This efficacy, however, is limited to those vasodilators which have venodilating ability, such as nitrates and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, when they are added to digitalis and diuretics in patients with moderate to severe heart failure. The utility of vasodilators without digitalis or diuretics requires further evaluation. The potential for vasodilators to prevent the development or progression of heart failure from latent to clinically overt disease is also being evaluated.", 
    "214": "Over 200 years age, William Withering described the advantages which might be gained by the considered use of extracts of the foxglove, digitalis purpurea, in patients with congestive heart failure, particularly if the rhythm was irregular. In the subsequent years many patients undoubtedly benefited from the use of this drug. The introduction of diuretics in the present century provided an alternative, more effective and safer treatment for heart failure. More recently, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have become available. The use of digoxin in the treatment of heart failure is now indicated almost solely for the control of a fast heart rate in patients with atrial fibrillation.", 
    "215": "The effect of captopril on renal function, central hemodynamics and the hormonal status was studied in 14 patients with chronic congestive heart failure in single administration of the drug at a dose of 25 mg and during short-term course therapy at a daily dose of 75 mg for 7 days. Captopril single administration was shown to cause an increase in natriuresis by 121% and diuresis by 120%. Correlation analysis showed that the natriuretic effect of captopril resulted from a decrease in tubular sodium reabsorption which, in its turn, was determined by a decrease in the production of angiotensin II and changes of pritubular circulation. Seven-day course therapy was accompanied by the patients' improved general status, improved indices of hemodynamics, and better tolerance to physical exercise. At the same time diuresis and renal excretion of sodium were above the basal level by 113 and 86%, respectively. It can be assumed that this natriuretic effect was determined by the suppression of angiotensin II, aldosterone and probably norepinephrine and vasopressin production. The analysis has shown that a favorable captopril renal effect is not mediated through improved central hemodynamics but results from changes of the hormonal and neurohumoral status.", 
    "216": "Vasodilation in congestive heart failure is an established therapeutic principal. The ventricular unloading improves contractile geometry and thereby improves working conditions for the contractile element: myocardial oxygen consumption falls and myocardial efficiency improves. This effect is independent from the vasodilating substance employed; it is, however, dependent on the simultaneous induction of pre- and afterload reduction. Vasodilation improves regional perfusion. Differential improvement in organ bloodflow is related to the type of vasodilator employed. It seems essential for a therapeutic benefit that renal and coronary perfusion are improved and that shunt flow, especially with steal phenomena, is avoided. Skeletal muscle bloodflow improves only slowly under ACE-inhibitor therapy. It could be shown that the immediate vasodilation due to ACE inhibition is followed by a second phase of vasodilation, which may be related to the influence of ACE inhibition of intraarterial wall angiotensin converting enzyme. Another factor possibly responsible for the delayed response to vasodilation in congestive heart failure, may be functional and structural changes in skeletal muscle. Reversal of these changes requires time. Both factors - the vessel wall related mechanism, as well as changes in parenchymal structure and function - require prolonged periods of treatment until therapeutic benefit can be seen.", 
    "217": "Adverse effects on serum triglycerides and cholesterol fractions have been reported in hypertensive patients treated with diuretics and non-selective beta-blockers. However, the changes induced by cardioselective beta-blockers and those with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) or by alpha-blockers have been shown to be more favourable. In addition, evidence suggests that calcium antagonists and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have little effect on serum lipid concentrations in hypertensive patients, although until now only diuretics and beta-blockers without ISA have been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality.", 
    "218": "This review will discuss the safety profiles of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors captopril, enalapril and lisinopril in patients with hypertension. In general, the safety profiles of ACE inhibitors compare favourably with those of other agents used for the treatment of hypertension. Adverse effects are not common when ACE inhibitors are used at the currently recommended doses. The adverse experiences that do occur with ACE inhibitors can be divided into 3 categories. Hypotension, hyperkalaemia and renal impairment are related directly to the blockade of the angiotensin-converting enzyme. Attention to the clinical condition, including concomitant therapy, reduces the risk of these adverse effects of ACE inhibition. Other adverse effects such as cough and angioedema also occur with all ACE inhibitors. The mechanisms are poorly understood, making it difficult to predict in which patients they will occur. Adverse effects such as rash, dysgeusia, neutropenia and proteinuria, which were reported relatively frequently in the early experience with captopril, are reported less frequently with lower doses of captopril and do not appear to be a problem with other ACE inhibitors such as enalapril and lisinopril.", 
    "219": "Tests used to evaluate the impact of drug therapies on mood and well-being need to be more sensitive than standard psychiatric tests, and specific procedures for the construction and validation of such instruments have been developed. Suitable questions are selected from an initial pool of possible test items and a questionnaire is formed. This undergoes a pretest procedure to eliminate any unclear or offensive questions and is then evaluated in a suitable group of patients for validity, responsiveness (i.e. sensitivity) and reproducibility. Using tests developed in this way, it has been shown that the transfer of hypertensive patients from standard triple therapy to placebo is accompanied by an increase in perceived well-being. Subsequent treatment with enalapril produced a further small increase in well-being. These and other results indicate that although angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may not have positive mood elevating properties, they are beneficial in terms of quality of life during treatment.", 
    "220": "Diabetic nephropathy is one of the major long term complications responsible for mortality in diabetes mellitus. While strict metabolic control of diabetes probably has a positive influence on kidney disease, most evidence supports the view that the process leading to end-stage renal failure has become independent of the metabolic disturbances of diabetes, and that haemodynamic factors in established nephropathy have become the predominant causes of progression of renal damage. In particular, increased intraglomerular pressure is thought to play a crucial part in the development of diabetic nephropathy. Therefore, drugs that can reduce intraglomerular pressure are of interest in treatment of hypertension in diabetic patients. The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to reduce intraglomerular pressure in animal studies, and the use of these drugs to treat insulin-dependent diabetics with hypertension has produced a reduction in the rate of decline of glomerular filtration rate. Although some beta-blockers can also have beneficial effects on renal function, they may produce unwanted metabolic effects. Thus the ACE inhibitors seem to be the most suitable antihypertensive drugs for diabetic patients.", 
    "221": "Renal damage in hypertension was thought to be a result of excessive renal arteriolar constriction leading to ischaemia and nephron damage. However, more recent studies have shown that in animal models the aetiology is one of increased intraglomerular pressure, and there is strong evidence that this is also the case in patients with essential hypertension. The problem is therefore one of inadequate constriction of afferent arterioles allowing increased systemic pressure to be transmitted to the glomerular capillaries. Since angiotensin II preferentially constricts the efferent arterioles, and since hypertensive patients have increased renovascular sensitivity to angiotensin II, this may explain why angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are the only drugs which actually lower intraglomerular pressure and why they reduce renal damage in hypertensive disease.", 
    "222": "The vascular impact of different antihypertensive drugs was assessed in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension by the use of the forearm circulation as a simple model to characterise the geometrical and distensible properties of the arterial system. The acute and chronic responses of the forearm arteries, expressed in terms of geometry (vasodilatation or vasoconstriction) and distensibility (arterial compliance, pulse-wave velocity), were not solely dependent on blood pressure levels. For similar blood pressure decreases, the dilatation of the forearm resistive vessels was associated either with an increase (calcium antagonists, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) or with a reduction (hydralazine-like drugs) or with no change (alpha- and beta-blocking drugs) in the calibre of the large forearm vessel. These non-homogeneous geometrical responses to antihypertensive drugs had important haemodynamic effects on the conduit, the buffering and the baroreflex functions of the arterial tree.", 
    "223": "A critical review of the medical treatment of heart failure reveals an insufficient efficacy of conventional therapy, associated with a lack of effect regarding improved survival. Inclusion of vasodilating substances into the regimen, for reduction of left ventricular impedance, offers the possibility of further improving the quality of life of patients with severe heart failure. In addition, some of these substances have now been proved to alter not only the quality but also the quantity of life in a beneficial way. Among the various vasodilators, ACE-inhibitors appear to exhibit a specific spectrum of effects that may contribute to the prolongation of survival in these patients. In particular, correction of hyponatremia, positive potassium and magnesium balance, reduction in the activity of vasopressor and volume retaining systems, as well as their potential anti-ischemic and antiarrhythmic effects, are plausible candidates for beneficially interfering with the progression of the disease. These documented effects make this type of therapy an invaluable inclusion in the modern treatment of heart failure.", 
    "224": "Numerous trials have shown the efficacy of ACE-inhibitors in moderate and severe essential hypertension. Their use must be regarded as very promising. They lower peripheral vascular resistance without influencing cardiac index and heart rate. Additionally, they maintain serum potassium and do not effect plasma lipids or provoke diabetes mellitus or gout. In 20-30% of hypertensive patients ACE-inhibitors have to be combined with diuretics and/or calcium antagonists. The addition of beta-blockers is useful in patients with resting tachycardia. In mild hypertension the use of ACE-inhibitors as first-line drugs is indicated in patients with adverse reactions to beta-blockers or diuretics. In bilateral renovascular hypertension, ACE-inhibitors may induce a strong blood pressure fall; in bilateral stenosis they contribute to a deterioration of renal function with reversible renal insufficiency. In renoparenchymal hypertension, ACE-inhibitors may attenuate the progression of renal insufficiency; in addition, proteinuria is lowered. In systolic hypertension in the elderly, one must be aware of a marked first-dose hypotensive effect. ACE-inhibitors decrease exaggerated exercise-induced elevation of blood pressure and heart rate and therefore lower myocardial oxygen consumption. In patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus, antihypertensive treatment should be initiated for blood pressure levels above 140/90 mmHg, to attenuate the progression of vascular damage in the kidney. In patients with severe left ventricular hypertrophy, ACE-inhibitors reduce left ventricular mass within three months by about 30%. In hypertension and coronary heart disease, recent studies report benefits of ACE-inhibitors on coronary circulation. Presently available ACE-inhibitors and those in preparation do not differ in pharmacodynamic, but in pharmacokinetic properties, concerning the beginning and duration of blood pressure lowering. A hypotensive first-dose effect can be observed in diuretic pretreated patients, in severe (malignant) and renovascular hypertension. ACE-inhibitors should not be used during pregnancy or in patients with autoimmune diseases or those undergoing treatment with immunosuppressive drugs, due to the side effects of neutropenia and proteinuria, which are more often seen under these conditions. Results from long-term studies on the influence of ACE-inhibitor treatment on cardiovascular risk in mild hypertension have not been available until now. In the decision to treat mild hypertension with ACE-inhibitors as first-line drug therapy, the costs of therapy in comparison to cheaper antihypertensives must be taken into account.", 
    "225": "Inhibition of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is associated with a decrease in renal vascular resistance, an increase in renal blood flow and a redistribution of intrarenal blood flow toward juxtamedullary nephrons. In general, ACE-inhibition does not affect normal glomerular filtration rate (GFR) but may increase GFR in patients on a low sodium intake prior to treatment. Since the rise in GFR is smaller than the rise in renal blood flow, in most instances a decrease in filtration fraction will result. In contrast to other vasodilator drugs, the decrease in blood pressure induced by ACE-inhibition is not accompanied by sodium retention, but rather by an initial natriuresis. ACE-inhibition also prevents secondary aldosteronism and thereby avoids renal potassium loss. The initial positive potassium balance after ACE-inhibition may protect patients with heart disease from potentially hazardous arrhythmias. Redistribution of intrarenal blood flow with increased medullary flow, in addition, will antagonize the hydrosmotic effect of vasopressin and thus result in a rise in free-water clearance. Finally, based on experimental evidence, long-term treatment with ACE-inhibitors may have a protective effect on renal function by reducing glomerular filtration pressure.", 
    "226": "Inhibition of angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE, kininase II) results in a reduced release of angiotensin II and in an accumulation of kinins. By pretreatment with inhibitors of the kallikrein-kinin systems, the blood pressure lowering effect of the ACE-inhibitors will be diminished. These results suggest that potentiation of kinins will participate in the blood pressure reduction by ACE-inhibitors. However, other studies contradict this hypothesis, showing that the inhibition of kallikrein-kinin systems per se will often result in a reduction of stimulated renin activity. Even the measurement of kinins in the blood cannot clarify the role of kinins in ACE-inhibition. Some new investigations discuss only a local and tissue-specific enhancement of kinins after ACE-inhibition, but up to now strong evidence for participation of kinins by local mechanisms in the action of ACE-inhibitors is still missing.",

Unilateral renal artery thrombosis and/or renal infarction was associated with severe impairment or lack of function on both studies (3 patients). Renal ischemia due to aortic thrombus manifested itself as lack of function only following captopril (2 patients). This approach predicted renal failure as a side effect of captopril therapy in 2 patients, 1 with unilateral (contralateral kidney infarcted) and the other with bilateral renal ischemia from aortic thrombus. Single-dose captopril scintigraphy may be a useful tool to predict tolerance to captopril therapy.", 
    "228": "The pharmacokinetic characteristics of intravenously-administered captopril were investigated in 7 healthy men 20 to 33 years old. Capropril, labeled with 14C, was given by injection over a 1 min period at mean doses of 2.78 mg (13.8 microCi), 5.67 mg (28.2 microCi) and 11.4 mg (56.8 microCi). Concentrations of unchanged captopril, captopril disulfide, and other metabolites (collectively) were determined in body fluids. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated for unchanged captopril, and it was shown that the disposition of intravenously-administered drug was linear with respect to dose over the dosage range studied.", 
    "229": "Antihypertensive drug treatments have been reported in clinical investigations to produce adverse effects to a degree that causes hypertensive patients to discontinue medication. Many of the debilitating effects reported by patients appear to be of central nervous system origin, such as sedation, fatigue, memory loss and sensorimotor disturbances. Human and animal laboratory studies in the past two decades have been characterizing the psychotropic effects of antihypertensive medications with use of a wide range of behavioral techniques. Antihypertensive drug classes covered in this review are beta-adrenergic blocking agents, alpha-adrenergic agonists, diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium channel blockers. While findings in animal studies show generally greater behavioral impairments after administration of alpha-adrenergic agonists in comparison with other drug classes, the few laboratory studies conducted with hypertensive subjects present a confusing picture. A need for further laboratory research with hypertensive subjects and, study of antihypertensive drug combinations is discussed.", 
    "230": "The decrease of blood pressure and the increase of plasma renin activity (PRA) after oral administration of captopril was evaluated in 104 consecutive hypertensive out-patients in whom the morphology of the renal arteries and parenchyma was assessed thanks to an intravenous digitalized angiography. Twenty five of these patients were excluded because of a natriuresis less than 50 mmol/24 h or non discontinuation of their treatment; 50 of these patients were classified as essential hypertension, 12 had renovascular disease (10 unilateral stenosis 2 of which significant; 2 bilateral significant stenosis); 9 had unilateral small kidneys (4 significant). The significance was ascertained on the PRA in the renal veins and/or the decrease of hypertension after surgery. The decrease of blood pressure after captopril was not different between the various groups. The increase after captopril of PRA was higher in unilateral significant lesions. However the highest post captopril PRA value was found in the essential hypertension group so that renovascular diseases could not be screened by higher post captopril PRA values. However taking into account that these latter were decreasing with age, a better discrimination of significant unilateral disease was possible in the hypertensive patients above 40 years of age. Furthermore once the diagnosis of unilateral kidney disease is established by radiological investigation, the captopril test allows to predict unilateral hypersecretion of renin with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 78%.",

The present study evaluated the degree of systemic ACE inhibition resulting from topical administration of 0.01 and 0.1% concentrations (10 and 100-fold greater than needed to lower IOP) of SCH 33861 in conscious rabbits. For reference purposes, captopril, a prototype ACE inhibitor, was examined at concentrations 5 and 20-fold greater than needed to lower IOP. Neither 0.01 nor 0.1% topical SCH 33861 led to inhibition of pressor responses to 0.3 micrograms/kg iv challenges with angiotensin I (AI) over a 4 hr period. Captopril, in contrast, caused significant attenuation of AI pressor responses. The magnitude and duration of systemic ACE inhibition following captopril administration was concentration related. Intravenous administration of the same dose administered topically did not cause any systemic ACE inhibition with 0.01% SCH 33861. Following iv 0.1% SCH 33861, 0.5 or 2.0% captopril, AI responses were inhibited 60-70% indicating the ability to inhibit ACE if any systemic absorption took place. Topical administration of 0.01% SCH 33861 twice daily for five days also did not produce systemic ACE inhibition. These findings indicate that topical amounts of SCH 33861 greatly in excess of those needed to effect reductions in IOP have an exceptionally low potential for producing systemic effects.", 
    "233": "1. Twelve normal volunteers were studied on 2 separate days, having taken a range of diets providing 50-300 mmol sodium per day for 3 days and having been dehydrated overnight. Each volunteer received a background intravenous infusion of arginine vasopressin (5 x 10(-7) i.u. kg-1 min-1) on both days, and also received 6 mg captopril orally on one day and a placebo tablet on the other. The ensuing changes in arterial pressure, and in urinary solute and solute-free water excretion were recorded. 2. Captopril did not significantly alter arterial pressure. It increased the rate of excretion of sodium but not of potassium, and it did not significantly change urinary osmolality or creatinine clearance. 3. Captopril increased the rate of solute-free water reabsorption and did so in direct proportion to its effect of increasing sodium excretion. 4. A further twelve normal, dehydrated volunteers on free diets were studied on each of 2 days, after taking 500 mg lithium carbonate on the previous evening. On each day, they also received a loading dose and maintenance infusion of inulin. On one day they received 50 mg captopril orally, and, on the other, they received a placebo tablet. The arterial pressure, urinary excretion of electrolytes, and inulin clearance were recorded. 5. Captopril increased the rates of excretion of sodium, lithium and potassium, but there were no significant changes in inulin clearance or arterial pressure. 6. The natriuretic effect of captopril in either group of twelve volunteers was not significantly less in those volunteers who were already excreting more sodium, at least over the range of dietary sodium loading to which the volunteers were subjected. 7.

    "234": "The role of nuclear medicine in the differential diagnosis of renovascular hypertension has been subject to considerable disagreement. The renogram has several distinct advantages as a diagnostic test, among which are the following: it is safe, easily performed, and has a high sensitivity for the differentiation of normal renal function from abnormal renal function. The use of the captopril renogram is based on the observation that renal function appears to be maintained in renovascular hypertension through a component of the renin-angiotensin system. Captopril renography will greatly improve the efficacy of the radionuclide renogram in the differential diagnosis of renovascular hypertension.", 
    "235": "In a multicentre study by general practitioners, the antihypertensive efficacy of urapidil, a postsynaptic alpha-blocker with central action, was compared with that of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril. The study was of a double-blind, randomised parallel-group design. Following a 2-week washout and placebo phase, 295 essential hypertensives (WHO I/II) were treated for 12 weeks with either urapidil or captopril, initially with urapidil 60 mg twice daily or captopril 25mg twice daily, with the possibility of adjusting the dose according to blood pressure response after 2 weeks of treatment [diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 90 mm Hg or less: reduction of urapidil to 30 mg twice daily or captopril to 12.5mg twice daily; DBP 91 to 99 mm Hg: dose unchanged; DBP 100 mm Hg or more: dose increased to urapidil 90 mg twice daily or captopril 50 mg twice daily].

    "236": "The choice of an appropriate antihypertensive agent and the hazards of postural hypotension are common problems faced in the treatment of diabetic hypertensive patients. The results of 3 studies addressing these problems are described in this report. In the first study, indoramin, an alpha-blocking agent, was administered to patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes and mild to moderate hypertension. Blood pressure control was achieved in 57% of patients with mild, and in none with moderate hypertension. The blood glucose and insulin responses to an oral 50g glucose loading, as well as the blood concentrations of HbA1 did not change during therapy. Seven patients were excluded because of side effects. In 4 of them postural hypotension was observed. In the second study, the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, administered to patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes and mild to moderate hypertension, were evaluated. Blood pressure control was achieved in 78% of the patients on captopril (n = 14) and in 74% of patients on enalapril therapy (n = 23). Symptomatic postural hypotension (n = 2) and hyperkalaemia (n = 2) were observed with both drugs. Significant reductions in 24-hour urinary protein or albumin excretion were detected in 12 patients on enalapril therapy. No changes in 2-hour postprandial blood glucose and HbA1 levels were observed during therapy with ACE inhibitors.

    "237": "Hypertension and certain alterations in serum lipoproteins such as a decrease in high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), an increase in low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) and perhaps also elevated triglycerides (Tg), are complementary coronary risk factors. Moreover, it has become evident that several of the drugs used for standard antihypertensive therapy may also interact with lipoprotein metabolism. The following has been observed after 1 to 12 months of treatment. Various diuretics can significantly increase LDL-C and/or very LDL-C and total C/HDL-C ratio, while HDL-C is often largely unchanged; Tg also are often elevated. LDL-C increased in diuretic-treated men and in chlorthalidone-treated postmenopausal women but not in chlorthalidone-treated premenopausal women. The latter may be protected from this side effect. Drug dosages were usually high in these studies. Indapamide, given at a dose of 2.5 mg/day, seems to exert no relevant effect on the lipoproteins. It is not established whether this difference is related to the nature of the drugs or the doses used. There is little doubt that the dose of chlorthalidone used was greater than that required for a full antihypertensive effect of this drug. Several beta-blockers given as monotherapy induce significant increases in Tg and a tendency for decreases in HDL-C. These changes are most prominent on non-selective beta 1+2-blockers without partial intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA), less pronounced on highly selective beta 1-blockers without ISA, and even more discrete or absent on beta-blockers with distinct ISA. Other sympatholytics such as reserpine, methyldopa, debrisoquine, urapidil, clonidine, labetalol, or postsynaptic alpha-blockers (prazosin, trimazosin, doxazosin etc.) did not affect or, postsynaptic alpha-blockers in particular, sometimes even slightly decreased Tg or LDL-C and very LDL-C values. During combination therapy, diuretic-induced increases in LDL-C were at short term prevented or reversed by the concomitant administration of certain beta-blockers, but not by sympatholytics such as reserpine, methyldopa or clonidine. With combined diuretic-prazosin treatment, a tendency for slightly higher HDL-C was reported. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (captopril, enalapril) and calcium channel blockers (verapamil, nifedipine, nitrendipine, diltiazem) seem to be largely devoid of undesirable effects on serum lipoproteins. Monotherapy with the potent direct vasodilator carprazidil improved blood pressure and significantly increased HDL-C. Whether and to what extent the observed variations in lipoproteins may persist beyond 1 year of treatment is as yet unclear.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "238": "In 16 hypertensive patients levels of glucose, immunoreactive insulin and C-peptide were studied during oral glucose tolerance test before and 10 days after treatment with captopril.

The relation between the clinical state, the perilimbal and eye fundus microcirculation and degree of BP decrease were studied using fluorescent angiography. An adequate (for this group of patients) effect was observed when blood pressure decreased by 25-30% as compared to the initial level. For this capoten, up to 150 mg per day, is sufficient. However, when the BP during the \"nitroprusside test\" and capoten \"overdosage\" fell by 35-40% or more as compared to the basal level, undesirable changes were observed. The angioarchitecture deteriorated considerably due to a significant increase in the number of non-perfused vessels and vast ischemic zones as compared to the initial state.", 
    "240": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are potent vasodilators acting by inhibition of production of the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II. In adults, they are used for treatment of systemic hypertension and congestive heart failure and investigated for treatment of primary pulmonary hypertension. In infants and children, saralasin and captopril were found to be useful in treatment of systemic arterial hypertension, especially when associated with high plasma renin activity. Captopril has failed in the treatment of congestive heart failure associated with complex congenital heart diseases and in most cases of primary pulmonary hypertension. It has a clear beneficial effect in coarctation of the aorta and may have such an effect in endomyocardial diseases and ventricular septal defect. In adults, serious side effects have limited the use of captopril. New converting enzyme inhibitors, devoid of a sulfhydryl group, are expected to have a better safety profile.", 
    "241": "In nuclear medicine new trends in the diagnosis of renal function are based on the introduction of new radiopharmaceuticals, improvements in the methodological part of the procedure and precise pharmacological intervention in response to given indications. Tc99m mercaptoacetyltriglycine (Tc99m MAG3) was tested as replacement for I123 orthoiodohippuric acid (I123 oIH) both in the form of a HPLC purified substance and as an impure kit preparation. HPLC purified Tc99m MAG3 clearance determinations in anuric patients showed a low extrarenal excretion amounting to only about 5% of the total clearance in normal patients. Kit preparations yielded about 90% of the labelled product; impurities were pertechnetate, reduced hydrolyzed Tc99m and chemically unidentified labelled products which showed a significantly lower renal, but increased hepatobiliary excretion in comparison with Tc99m MAG3. The renal clearance with kit preparations of Tc99m MAG3 was 55% of the clearance with oIH at a comparable urinary excretion. Significantly higher protein binding and therefore, a decrease in the distribution volume of Tc99m was found in comparison with I123 oIH. No difference was recorded between the two substances with respect to the renogram curves in normal subjects, apart from a modest delay in the elimination of Tc99m MAG3. For clinical purposes kit preparations of Tc99m MAG3 proved equal to I123 oIH. The influence of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (captopril) leads to characteristic changes in the renograms of patients with Goldblatt hypertension. Quantitative criteria for the evidence of haemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis were derived from investigations without and with captopril (25 mg) (I123 oIH and Tc99m DTPA) in 21 patients with essential hypertension. The criteria were defined as follows: a delay in peak activity (Tmax) in the I123 oIH captopril renogram exceeding 2 minutes as compared with the baseline value and/or a lower uptake of Tc99m DTPA in comparison with the uptake of I123 oIH (uptake quotient I123 oIH/Tc99m DTPA greater than 1.2). The diagnostic and prognostic potential of the captopril renogram was compared with that of the captopril test by investigating 34 patients with renal artery stenosis (23 uni-, 11 bilateral) (atherosclerosis: 23, fibromuscular hyperplasia: 11). The captopril renogram was positive more often (n = 12) than the captopril test (n = 4) in patients without renal functional impairment of the stenosed kidney. Similar results were obtained with both methods in patients with atrophic kidneys: captopril renography was positive in all cases with a positive captopril test.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "242": "The interaction of the converting enzyme (CE)-inhibitor ramipril and the bradykinin (BK)-antagonist D-Arg-[Hyp2, Thi5,8, D-Phe7]BK with angiotensin I (ANG), ANG II and BK were studied in isolated hearts of rats and guinea pigs. In isolated working rat hearts perfusion with ANG I and ANG II reduced cardiac function and coronary flow, increased the activities of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase (CK) in the perfusate, decreased high-energy rich phosphates and glycogen in the myocardium and increased duration and incidence of post-ischemic reperfusion arrhythmias. BK on the other hand reduced LDH and CK activities, improved metabolic parameters in the myocardium and reduced reperfusion arrhythmias. In isolated rat hearts pretreatment with ramipril protected against reperfusion arrhythmias and reduced enzyme activities of LDH and CK in the coronary effluent. Cardiodynamic parameters and coronary flow improved and myocardial tissue levels of glycogen, ATP and creatine phosphate (CP) were elevated. Almost identical changes were seen during perfusion with BK. The cardioprotective effects produced by both, the CE-inhibitor and BK, were completely abolished when the BK-antagonist was added to the perfusate, while a smaller inhibition was obtained by indomethacin perfusion. In isolated guinea pig hearts BK increased coronary flow. Single-dose oral pretreatment with ramipril potentiated, whereas perfusion with the BK-antagonist abolished this effect. These data add support to the hypothesis that local inhibition of CE = kininase II contributes to the beneficial effects of CE-inhibitors in the heart.", 
    "243": "Cardiac adaptation to long-standing arterial hypertension consists of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), usually of the concentric type, i.e. an increase in wall thickness at the expense of chamber volume. LVH can no longer be considered only as a simple adaptive myocardial process; it drastically increases the risk of sudden death and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, irrespective of the levels of arterial pressure. Patients with LVH have more premature ventricular contractions than patients without LVH or normotensive subjects, which indicates that LVH per se increases ventricular ectopic activity. Antihypertensive therapy should not only lower blood pressure, but also prevent or improve end-organ damage and therefore allow left ventricular mass to regress. Although they lower blood pressure, certain antihypertensive agents such as the thiazide diuretics and arteriolar dilators (hydralazine, minoxidil) have little or even a detrimental effect on LVH. In contrast, other agents such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta-blockers, antiadrenergic drugs, and certain calcium antagonists decrease left ventricular mass in parallel with arterial pressure. Recent evidence has shown that a decrease in left ventricular mass induced by certain antihypertensive drugs suppresses ventricular ectopic activity by 85%. In contrast, left ventricular mass and ventricular ectopic activity remain unchanged or may even increase in patients treated with diuretics. It is not known whether the risk of sudden death can be decreased and the ominous prognosis of LVH altered by such specific antihypertensive therapy.", 
    "244": "The present study was designed to examine the effects of two new angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, CGS 14831 and CGS 16617 (3 mg/kg i. v. 1 min prior to occlusion and 4 and 24 h after occlusion), on myocardial ischemic (MI) damage and left-ventricular hypertrophy in rats. Administration of CGS 14831 or CGS 16617 inhibited angio-tensin-I-induced pressor responses by 40-100% for 4 h after each dose. Myocardial creatine phosphokinase (CK) levels were 10.6 +/- 0.6 U/mg protein in sham-MI animals, and following coronary artery occlusion for 48 h were decreased to 4.1 +/- 0.2 U/mg protein in MI + vehicle animals (p less than 0.01). CGS 14831 and CGS 16617 attenuated the decrease in CK content and resulted in 47 and 40% sparing, respectively, of the left-ventricular free wall. Neither agent attenuated the left-ventricular hypertrophy which developed following coronary artery occlusion. These data indicate that the nonsulfhydryl ACE inhibitors CGS 14831 and CGS 16617 have a significant cardioprotective effect in rats surviving 48 h, and suggest a potential therapeutic usefulness of these agents for the treatment of ischemia-induced heart failure.", 
    "245": "To investigate the pathophysiology of elevated urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) activity in human hypertension, total and fractional urinary NAG activities were correlated with Li clearance, a measure of proximal renal tubular Na reabsorption, in 15 white hypertensive subjects, aged 56 years, and in 13 normotensive control subjects. In 11 hypertensive subjects, the measurements were repeated after 2 months of antihypertensive therapy with the converting enzyme inhibitor cilazapril (2.5 or 5.0 mg daily). Urinary NAG activity was increased in hypertensives and correlated directly with Li clearance in both hypertensive and normotensive subjects. Li clearance and urinary NAG activity were reduced by antihypertensive therapy. The findings indicate an inverse correlation between urinary NAG activity and proximal renal tubular Na reabsorption, suggesting that NAG is reabsorbed in the proximal renal tubules with Na and other proteins. High Li clearance and urinary NAG activity in hypertension are in part functional and, therefore, reversible disturbances of renal function.", 
    "246": "The effects of cicletanine were compared with those of four other antihypertensive drugs (prazosin, a highly selective alpha 1 antagonist; captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor; indapamide, an antihypertensive diuretic; and hydrochlorothiazide, a purely diuretic agent) on young stroke-prone SHR rats with high-salt diet. All the drugs except hydrochlorothiazide prevented the onset of hypertension. The minimal effective dose on blood pressure was 1 mg/kg for both cicletanine and captopril, and 3 mg/kg for indapamide. The action on cardiac hypertrophy and diuresis occurs at a dose of cicletanine 10 to 30 times higher than that required to produce the antihypertensive effect. Renal hypertrophy was also decreased significantly by cicletanine at a dose of 100 mg/kg.", 
    "247": "Plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) were measured in patients with organic heart disease undergoing diagnostic cardiac catheterization. Independent of nature and duration of the disease (valvular heart disease, congestive cardiomyopathy) plasma ANP levels were closely related to the severity of cardiac failure. Furthermore, plasma ANP levels were found to be negatively correlated with the cardiac index and to be positively correlated with right and/or left atrial and with pulmonary artery pressures. During physical exercise (bicycle ergometer) a marked increase of plasma ANP levels was observed, which was closely related to increments in mean pulmonary artery pressure. This rise in plasma ANP levels during physical exercise was not attenuated in patients with already elevated resting plasma concentrations of ANP. In patients with congestive cardiomyopathy, afterload-reduction by ACE-inhibition resulted in changes of central hemodynamics, which were closely reflected by venous concentrations of ANP. The measurement of plasma ANP levels may serve as an indicator of the severity of cardiac failure. Plasma concentrations of ANP, however, are neither helpful in establishing the etiology of the underlying heart disease nor in differentiating left and right heart failure. However, in cases of already established organic heart disease plasma ANP levels may be used as a marker for assessing the efficacy of the therapeutic regimen.", 
    "248": "A noninvasive single injection technique for the measurement of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) using technetium99m diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) was developed for use in the rat. GFR measurements obtained by the technique correlated well with those obtained by Cr51 EDTA infusion (R = 0.95, n = 7). The coefficient of variation was 8.4%. GFR was measured over 4 weeks in diabetic and control rats. GFR increased with time in both groups, with no difference between the groups; however, when corrected for body weight, diabetes was associated with an increased GFR (diabetic 13.6 +/- 1.7 vs. control 10.4 +/- 0.1 ml/min/kg p less than 0.001). Insulin treated rats had higher GFRs than untreated diabetics (p less than 0.05), but GFR/kg was reduced to that of nondiabetic controls. High protein intake in diabetic rats caused an increase in GFR after 1 week of diabetes, but this was not sustained by the fourth week. Genetic hypertension and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition with ramipril had no effect on GFR in diabetic rats. We conclude that serial measurement of GFR in the diabetic rat is accurate and reproducible. Genetic hypertension, high protein intake, and ACE inhibition have little effect on GFR in experimental diabetes.", 
    "249": "The renal circulation of patients with essential hypertension and renovascular hypertension was evaluated using 99mTc-DTPA. The first renal peak count (the first Cmax; FCmax), time phase distribution (the first Tmax; FTmax), and blood velocity (the FCmax/FTmax) were calculated by digital imaging. This yields a visual image of the renal circulation. We consider that the increase in the renal first pass blood flow in patients with essential hypertension is best observed pixel by pixel. The FCmax and FCmax/FTmax images before and after treatment by percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty in patients with renovascular hypertension clearly show its therapeutic effect. The FI technique, therefore, has the advantage that it can be performed at the same time as the conventional routine examinations of renal function. This makes it very useful clinically.", 
    "250": "1 Fosinopril sodium is the first phosphorus-containing angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor to be studied clinically as an antihypertensive agent. It is an ester prodrug that is hydrolysed in vivo to the active diacid ACE inhibitor, SQ 27, 519. 2 In a three-way crossover study, nine healthy male subjects (age range 20-34 years) each received an intravenous 7.5 mg dose of SQ 27, 519-[14C] and two oral 10 mg doses of [14C]-fosinopril sodium, administered as a capsule and in solution. 3 After the intravenous dose of SQ 27, 519, the 0 to 96 h recovery of radioactivity averaged 44 and 46% of the dose in urine and faeces, respectively, indicating substantial biliary secretion. Only intact SQ 27, 519 was detected in the plasma, urine, and faeces following the intravenous dose of SQ 27, 519. 4 After oral doses of fosinopril sodium, about 75% of the radioactivity in plasma and urine was present as SQ 27, 519; the remainder corresponded mainly to a beta-glucuronide conjugate of SQ 27, 519 (15-20%), and a monohydroxylated analogue of SQ 27, 519 (about 5%). Negligible amounts of fosinopril sodium were present, indicating complete hydrolysis of the prodrug. 5 For the solution and capsule doses, respectively, the oral absorption of fosinopril sodium averaged 32% and 36% and the oral bioavailability of SQ 27, 519 averaged 25% and 29%. 6 The average values for clearance (39 ml min-1), renal clearance (17 ml min-1), Vss (10 1), and plasma protein binding (approximately 95%), indicated that SQ 27, 519 was slowly cleared from the body and not distributed extensively into extravascular sites.",

The acute toxicity in mice, rats, and dogs after oral and intravenous administration is very low. There were no significant differences in LD50 values between male and female animals. Treatment periods up to 6 months in rats and monkeys and up to 12 months in dogs revealed consistent compound-related effects with respect to the kidneys and the hemopoietic system probably due to exaggerated pharmacological activity. Species-specific lesions in the gastric fundal mucosa were noted exclusively in rats. No adverse effects were seen at doses of 0.25 mg/kg/d in rats, 2.5 mg/kg/d in dogs, and 0.5 mg/kg/d in monkeys.

    "252": "Six weeks of treatment with carvedilol, N-696, celiprolol, dilevalol, acebutolol, urapidil, doxazosin and altiopril reduced blood pressure with various changes in heart rate. Cardiac index decreased and total peripheral resistance index (TPRI) stayed at the pretreatment levels in the carvedilol, N-696 and acebutolol groups, whereas TPRI tended to decrease in the celiprolol (p less than 0.05), dilevalol (p less than 0.05), urapidil, doxazosin (p less than 0.05) and altiopril groups; cardiac index was unchanged in these groups. As carvedilol and N-696 have no beta 1-selectivity and no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA), their direct vasodilating property (and the possible alpha-blocking activity of carvedilol) may precipitate in minimising an increase in TPRI induced by vascular beta 2-blockade and suppressed cardiac pump function. Celiprolol and dilevalol, with beta 2-selective ISA, reduced cardiac index slightly and insignificantly, and decreased TPRI. These results indicate that ISA on vascular beta 2-receptors may induce vasodilatation and ISA on cardiac beta 2-receptors may counteract cardiac beta 2-blockade. Differences in haemodynamic responses between these drugs with ISA and vasodilators such as alpha-blocking agents (urapidil and doxazosin) and an ACE inhibitor, altiopril, may be attributable to manifestation of cardiac beta-blockade as observed in the drugs with ISA.", 
    "253": "Twenty patients with moderate (4) to severe (16) hypertension, whose blood pressure (BP) could not be controlled on the previous combined antihypertensive therapy, were investigated. In acute studies the first doses of captopril, 25 and 50 mg led to a significant drop in BP 30 min after administration. The maximum fall in BP was recorded at 90-120 min and this effect was maintained throughout the whole observation period (8 hours). The fall in BP was similar in supine and standing positions and there was no change in the heart rate. During long-term (14.5 months) therapy only 2 out of the 20 patients exhibited continuing good BP control with captopril monotherapy of a maximum daily dose of 150 mg. A comparison of the acute and chronic BP lowering effects of captopril showed that the first dose of captopril caused a significantly greater decrease in BP than chronic monotherapy. However, combined captopril with a diuretic or with a diuretic and calcium antagonist or beta blocker provided a sustained BP control, significantly better than the previously used anti-hypertensive combinations (182 +/- 27/115 +/- 11 mmHg vs 164 +/- 20/104 +/- 11 mmHg p less than 0.05). The Hungarian captopril preparation (Tensiomin), similarly to other captopril products, through its angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition, caused an increase in plasma renin activity and in concentration of plasma angiotensin I and a decrease in plasma angiotensin II. Eight out of the 20 patients developed side effects, which disappeared spontaneously in 4 patients within 2-14 days. Captopril was withdrawn in 3 patients for not achieving satisfactory BP control and/or because of side effects. It is concluded that captopril is safe and effective in the long-term treatment of hypertension, however, majority of the patients with severe forms of hypertension required double or multiple combinations.", 
    "254": "Muscular exercise is the most common stress imposed on the cardiovascular system and, in hypertensive patients, it causes an exaggerated increase in the already elevated blood pressure. The evaluation of any antihypertensive drug must, therefore, include an investigation of its effects on the haemodynamic response to exercise. For this reason the effects of celiprolol and enalapril were studied in hypertensive patients, both at rest and during an exercise stress test performed on a bicycle ergometer. The haemodynamic changes observed were very similar at rest: both drugs consistently reduced blood pressure without impairing either myocardial geometry or function. The only between drug difference found at rest was slight bradycardia with celiprolol, whereas heart rate was unaffected by enalapril. By contrast, there was a marked difference in the effect on the blood pressure increase caused by muscular exercise: 24 h after dosing, celiprolol continued to attenuate the hypertensive response to exercise while enalapril failed to show any significant antihypertensive effect possibly because after this time there was a reduction in angiotensin converting enzyme inhibiting activity. Thus, celiprolol and enalapril are both effective once-a-day antihypertensive agents, but celiprolol provides a longer lasting protection from hypertensive peaks caused by exercise.", 
    "255": "1. Rabbit small intestinal brush border membranes possessed prominent angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity. 2. Intestinal ACE was located on the lumen surface, as verified by ACE co-enrichment with brush border membrane marker enzymes. 3. Hydrolysis kinetics of rabbit intestinal ACE were comparable to the lung, utilizing the substrate (N-[3-(2-furyl)acryloyl]-L-phenylalanylglycylglycine; the Vmax = 543 +/- 51 mumol/min/g and Km = 0.62 +/- 0.09 mmol/l. 4. Intestinal brush border ACE activity was strongly inhibited by the antihypertensive drug Ramipril, which yielded an IC50 value of 5 nmol/l; the ACE activity remained completely inhibited during 15 days after a single dose of 10 mumol/l Ramipril.", 
    "256": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of several pharmacological compounds on the motility and velocity of washed human spermatozoa. Results were evaluated by multiple exposure photography and computer-aided picture analysis. The motility-inhibiting effect of the antifertility drug gossypol was confirmed. Gossypol proved to be a potent inhibitor of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) detectable in high concentrations in seminal plasma. However, human sperm motility was not inhibited during incubation with two other specific ACE-inhibitors (captopril, enalapril). On the contrary, high concentrations of captopril even showed a slight motility-stimulating effect. These results indicate no direct involvement of ACE in the regulation of sperm motility but suggest a direct interaction of gossypol with the plasma membrane of spermatozoa. To clarify whether or not gossypol blocks membranous ion transport, the effect of well-defined ion transport blocking agents on sperm motility was investigated. It was determined that the acetylcholine receptor blocker alpha-bungarotoxin and trifluoperazine, a specific calmodulin antagonist, inhibit sperm motility completely. Since stimulation of sperm motility by captopril may be due to an alpha-mimetic action of this compound, the influence of two alpha receptor blockers (bromocriptine, lisuride) on sperm motility was studied. Although lisuride inhibited sperm motility completely, bromocriptine revealed no influence. A temporary and reversible intervention with membrane transport processes could be a suitable way to regulate human sperm motility and male fertility.", 
    "257": "The immature kidney may be adversely affected by a variety of vasoactive or diuretic drugs, either administered to the mother during pregnancy, or to the neonate. Inhibitors of the angiotensin-converting enzyme administered to the hypertensive pregnant woman can severely and sometimes definitely impair renal function in the fetus, leading to postnatal anuria. Pathogenesis involves interference with the renin-angiotensin system and the prostaglandins. Beta-adrenergic agents administered during labor depress glomerular filtration rate transiently. Tolazoline, an alpha-adrenergic blocking agent useful in the treatment of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the neonate induces intense renal vasoconstriction with consequent hypoperfusion. Indomethacin, a prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor used for the pharmacological closure of a patent ductus arteriosus, also increases renal vascular resistance, and decreases urine output. Furosemide, the drug most often used in oliguric neonates, may also adversely affect the newborn infant. Its use has been associated with an increase in the incidence of patent ductus arteriosus, hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis and secondary hyperparathyroidism. These observations demonstrate that the proper use of drugs requires that the therapeutic endpoint be clearly defined and the predictable side effects be anticipated.", 
    "258": "1. Intra-arterial blood pressures and heart rates were recorded in conscious, unrestrained, Long Evans and Brattleboro rats receiving sequential, continuous administrations of selective alpha 1- (prazosin) and alpha 2- (idazoxan) adrenoceptor antagonists. The same protocols were also run in the presence of ICI 118551 (a selective antagonist of beta 2-adrenoceptors). 2. Prazosin and idazoxan caused large, but transient, hypotensions in Long Evans and Brattleboro rats. In the continued presence of both drugs there were marked, intermittent, depressor episodes and tachycardias in both strains of rat. 3. In the presence of low or high doses of ICI 118551 the hypotensive responses to prazosin and idazoxan were markedly reduced in both strains of rat and blood pressures showed little variability, although intermittent tachycardias still occurred. 4. In adrenal-demedullated Long Evans rats, the hypotensive responses to prazosin and idazoxan were attenuated and in the presence of both drugs, blood pressure was relatively steady, although intermittent tachycardias still occurred. 5. In the presence of prazosin and idazoxan, when a depressor episode was not occurring, administration of captopril caused hypotension in Long Evans and Brattleboro rats. In the latter, the reduction in blood pressure was sustained, whereas there was a recovery in blood pressure in Long Evans rats. This recovery was punctuated by depressor episodes, and was abolished by a V1-receptor antagonist (d(CH2)5DAVP). 6. Long Evans rats given two primed doses of the non-selective alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist, phentolamine, exhibited variation in blood pressure similar to that seen in the presence of prazosin and idazoxan. As in the latter case, blood pressure variability was inhibited by the beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, ICI 118551. 7. Administration of idazoxan into a lateral ventricle in Long Evans rats receiving phenoxybenzamine intravenously did not cause blood pressure instability. However, intravenous administration of idazoxan in the same animals produced intermittent depressor episodes and tachycardias similar to those seen in the presence of prazosin and idazoxan. 8. The simplest explanation of the results is that beta 2-adrenoceptor-mediated depressor mechanisms contribute to the hypotensive responses to alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonism. Furthermore, in the presence of adequate peripheral alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonism, blood pressure may be maintained by the renin-angiotensin system and vasopressin (although it is only when the former system has been antagonized that a clear-cut pressor action of vasopressin is apparent). Under these conditions, blood pressure maintenance is interrupted by intermittent depressor episodes that are largely due to adrenal medullary activation.", 
    "259": "1. In the anaesthetized open-chest dog, BW A575C (N-(1-(S)-carboxy-5-[4(3- isopropylamino-2-(R,S)-hydroxypropoxy)indole-2- carboxamido]pentyl)-(R,S)-alanyl-(S)-proline) causes a dose-dependent inhibition of the isoprenaline response (increased cardiac rate). In this preparation BW A575C is approximately 50 times less active than propranolol, and 500 times less active than pindolol at the cardiac beta 1-adrenoceptor. 2. At equieffective cardiac beta 1-adrenoceptor blocking doses in the anaesthetized, open-chest dog, BW A575C (5.0 mg kg-1, i.v.) significantly reduces diastolic blood pressure and reduces cardiac contractility and rate. By contrast, propranolol (0.1 mg kg-1, i.v.) and pindolol (0.01 mg kg-1, i.v.) have little effect on diastolic blood pressure, but significantly reduce cardiac contractility and rate. The effects of BW A575C on cardiac rate are not significantly different from those of propranolol and pindolol, but its effects on cardiac contractility are significantly less than those of propranolol. BW A575C also produces some increase in left ventricular internal dimensions at end-diastole. This small cardiac dilatation is not significantly different from that observed with pindolol but is significantly less than that of propranolol. 3. In the anaesthetized closed-chest dog, BW A575C causes a dose-dependent inhibition of the angiotensin I pressor response. In this preparation BW A575C is approximately equiactive with enalapril at preventing the pressor response due to conversion of exogenous angiotensin I to angiotensin II (inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)). 4. At equieffective ACE-inhibition doses in the anaesthetized, closed-chest dog, BW A575C (1.0 mg kg-1 by i.v. infusion) significantly reduces diastolic blood pressure, cardiac contractility and rate, whereas enalapril (1.0 mg kg-1 by i.v. infusion) only significantly reduces diastolic blood pressure. This blood pressure lowering effect of enalapril is not significantly different from that of BW A575C. In this preparation BW A575C and enalapril also significantly increase renal blood flow, and renal excretion of urine and Na+. There is however no significant difference between their renovascular effects. 5. These studies demonstrate that BW A575C produces changes in cardiac and renovascular function which can be ascribed to its being an ACE-inhibitor and a beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent. The combination of these pharmacological properties results in a fall in blood pressure without compromising either cardiac performance or renal function.", 
    "260": "The effects of angiotensin II on pressor responses to electrical field stimulation (1-32 Hz) of the adrenal gland were assessed in pithed male Sprague-Dawley rats. Stimulation elicited frequency-related pressor responses and increments in plasma catecholamines. Interruption of the renin-angiotensin system with the converting enzyme inhibitor captopril or the receptor antagonist saralasin significantly attenuated the pressor responses to adrenal stimulation and injected epinephrine to an equivalent extent. This observation, along with the finding that captopril did not alter the plasma catecholamine increments produced by adrenal stimulation, suggested that endogenously generated angiotensin II was not affecting adrenal catecholamine release. Instead angiotensin II appears to interact at the level of the vascular smooth muscle, because reinfusion of angiotensin II (20 ng.kg-1.min-1 iv) in captopril-treated animals restored responsiveness to stimulation and epinephrine. Infusion of vasopressin also restored pressor activity after captopril; therefore the interaction does not appear to be specific for angiotensin II but may depend on the background tone of the vascular smooth muscle. Moreover, decreasing blood pressure with sodium nitroprusside reversibly attenuated the pressor responses to both adrenal stimulation and epinephrine. The results suggest that endogenously formed angiotensin II facilitates the vasoconstrictor activity of epinephrine by increasing vascular tone.", 
    "261": "The mechanisms mediating the effects of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) on the cardiovascular system were studied in the conscious rat. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of TRH (8 pmol-80 nmol/kg) induced dose-dependent increases in mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and cardiac index. Hindquarter blood flow increased due to vasodilation, while an increase in renal and mesenteric vascular resistance caused a decrease in blood flow in the respective organs. The plasma levels of norepinephrine and epinephrine were increased by TRH, while there was no change in plasma renin activity or vasopressin. The cardiovascular actions of i.c.v. TRH were not influenced by blockade of the renin-angiotensin system or vasopressin receptors. The ganglion blocker chlorisondamine and the alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoreceptor antagonist phentolamine (2 mg/kg i.v.) abolished the increase in blood pressure and mesenteric vasoconstriction after i.c.v. TRH. Propranolol (2 mg/kg i.v.) blocked the TRH-induced increase in cardiac index, heart rate, and hindquarter blood flow. The hindquarter vasodilation induced by TRH was also blocked by the selective beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 188,551 (1 or 2 mg/kg i.v.), while the beta 1-adrenoceptor blocker practolol (10 mg/kg i.v.) had no effect on the hindquarter vasodilation produced by TRH but totally blocked the increase in cardiac index. In adrenal demedullated rats, the systemic hemodynamic effects of i.c.v. TRH were diminished along with the decrease in renal blood flow and increase in renal vascular resistance; however, the increase in hindquarter blood flow was attenuated only in adrenal demedullated rats pretreated with the sympathetic blocker bretylium. The renal vasoconstriction induced by i.c.v. TRH was not abolished by renal denervation. In sinoaortic debuffered rats, the pressor, tachycardic, and mesenteric vasoconstrictor responses to centrally administered TRH were significantly potentiated. Taken together, these data suggest that the putative neurotransmitter TRH may play a role in central regulation of cardiac functions and organ blood flow distribution through both the sympathetic nerves and the adrenal medulla. A pivotal role for beta 2-adrenoceptors in mediation of hindquarter vasodilation is also demonstrated.", 
    "262": "1. The converting enzyme inhibitors, captopril (SQ14 225, Squibb) or enalaprilic acid (MK 422, Merck Sharp and Dohme), were used to evaluate the role of angiotensin II in sodium (Na) appetite of Na-deplete rats given a choice of water and 0.5 mol/l NaCl to drink. Also, the effect of these drugs on taste was evaluated in water-deprived Na-replete rats and in Na-deplete rats given a choice of NaCl, sucrose and water. 2. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of furosemide (20 mg/kg) increased urinary Na loss by 1.3-1.4 mmol and subsequent Na intake by 1.5-1.8 mmol. This increase in Na intake was abolished by a high dose of captopril (50 mg/kg, i.p.) or enalaprilic acid (80 mg/kg, i.p.), but was enhanced by a low dose of captopril (50 micrograms/kg, i.p.). 3. There was no clear evidence that either captopril or enalapril affected taste for NaCl, sucrose or water in water-deprived Na-replete rats. However, the high dose of captopril or enalapril decreased the intake of NaCl and sucrose in Na-deplete rats. 4. Thus, while the results are consistent with the possibility that angiotensin II is involved in Na appetite induced by Na depletion and that the difference between the high and low doses of converting enzyme inhibitors on Na appetite may be related to their relative effectiveness in blocking angiotensin I conversion at central sites, the observation that sucrose intake is decreased by high dose converting enzyme inhibitor in Na-deplete rats suggests that other actions of the converting enzyme inhibitors may be involved.", 
    "263": "Haemodynamic and humoral effects of captopril were studied in patients with essential and renovascular hypertension. Captopril decreased significantly both systolic and diastolic blood pressure and moderately, it reduced also the heart rate. On the basis of the haemodynamic effects our patients could be divided into two groups: in patients where the total peripheral resistance (TPR) exceeded 2000 dyn x sec x cm-5 during rest, captopril exerted its hypotensive effect by decreasing TPR. In patients in whom TPR was lower, the hypotensive action could be attributed to the reduction of cardiac output (CO). Captopril increased plasma renin activity, and decreased the activity of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in the plasma. In acute study captopril did not influence plasma noradrenaline level but increased it during long-term administration. It did not affect dopamine or adrenaline levels. Captopril had no effect on plasma beta-endorphin concentration, moreover, the opiate antagonist, naloxone, failed to antagonize its antihypertensive effect. Comparing the acute effects of Capoten (Squibb, USA) and Tensiomin (EGIS, HUNGARY) no significant differences were found.", 
    "264": "The rat kidney was separated into the outer cortex, inner cortex, outer medulla and inner medulla or papilla, and the distribution of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in response to consecutive administrations of captopril was studied. In normal animals, the ACE activity in the inner cortex and outer medulla was about 10 and 3 times higher than in the outer cortex, respectively, and the activity in the inner medulla was much the same as that in the outer cortex. Captopril was given in doses of 30 and 100 mg/kg/day for 7 days, and the renal ACE activity on the 8th day was examined. Since it was assumed that the ACE activity might be lower than the full activity when the tissue contained captopril, diamide, a sulfhydryl oxidant, was used to eliminate the effect of any captopril remaining in the tissue extracts. However, this compound at concentrations over 1 mM enhanced the activity of ACE itself to about twice the value when assayed without diamide. Thus, oxidation with sufficient concentrations of diamide resulted in an enhancement of a maximal activity of ACE. When all samples were pretreated with 10 mM diamide and the ACE activity determined, captopril caused a dose-related increase in the ACE activity, but only in the inner cortex. We conclude that ACE locates predominantly in the inner cortex of the rat kidney and it is this area which has an altered ACE activity in response to captopril.", 
    "265": "We examined baroreflex function and plasma angiotensin II (Ang II) before and after the treatment with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) in eight inpatients with essential hypertension (EHT). Baroreflex sensitivity (BS), expressed as a slope of linear relationship between %-changes in mean blood pressure (BP) and those in plasma concentration of norepinephrine (pNE), was greater during BP reduction by sodium nitroprusside (SNP) than during BP elevation by phenylephrine (PE). Enalapril treatment for 7 days reduced BP without a significant change in heart rate and pNE. It also increased the BS in two cases during SNP infusion and in four cases during PE infusion. Ang II was not significantly reduced after enalapril, while plasma ACE activity was suppressed by about 80% and plasma renin activity (PRA) was elevated. The changes in BS did not correlate with the changes in Ang II. The shift of barofunction curve with an enhancement of BS by enalapril therapy might not be attributed solely to the interaction between circulating Ang II and central baroreflex mechanisms.", 
    "266": "The role of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in the development of tolerance to the diuretic effect of furosemide was investigated in 12 healthy male volunteers. Furosemide in a dose of 40 mg daily for one week had a brisk acute diuretic effect, but did not lead to dehydration, hyponatremia or fall in blood pressure. The reason for this was a reduction in sodium excretion between doses (rebound effect) and a decrease in sensitivity to furosemide from day 1 to day 7. The latter phenomenon is referred to as delayed tolerance to furosemide. Inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme with lisinopril 20 mg daily did not change the renal furosemide excretion rate, the renal sensitivity to furosemide or the tolerance development. Thus, delayed tolerance to furosemide diuresis was not related to dehydration or activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Other mechanisms, probably intrarenal, will have to be looked for.", 
    "267": "Fifteen patients (median age 73 years) with severe congestive heart failure were treated with Enalapril for a total of 12 weeks with a significant improvement in their right atrial pressures and in their functional state. Renal function, serum potassium, magnesium and calcium levels were unchanged. Lymphocyte sodium, potassium and calcium levels were generally lower than control values throughout the study but these differences were only statistically significant early in the study. Lymphocyte magnesium levels were unchanged. These findings are in contrast to those previously reported in the literature for such patients treated with conventional diuretics.", 
    "268": "The intrarenal kallikrein-kinin system was studied during the acute phase of renovascular hypertension induced by renal artery constriction and during teprotide inhibition of kininase II in the dog. Kallikrein-like activity measured by both kininogenase and esterolytic assays, was increased during renal artery constriction (p less than 0.5) and (p less than 0.01). The administration of teprotide resulted in a further increase of renal cortical kallikrein-like activity and inhibited kininase II activity (p less than 0.01). Following the inhibition of kininase II, the plasma concentration of kininogen was also significantly decreased (p less than 0.01). These results suggest that kininase II inhibition may increase levels of intrarenal and plasma kinins and that decreased degradation of kinin peptides may contribute significantly to the acute hypertensive effect of teprotide.", 
    "269": "The renin-angiotensin system and the sympathetic nervous system are important control mechanisms in blood pressure regulation. A large body of in vitro and in vivo animal data indicate that angiotensin II regulates noradrenaline release and modifies sympathetic reflexes, although the physiological relevance of these to normal man remains unclear. It is established, however, that increasing age and hypertension independently modify autonomic responses in man. The hypothesis was therefore examined that angiotensin II exerts a pre-junctional effect on noradrenaline release and sympathetic cardiovascular function, in the elderly and in patients with essential hypertension. Inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme with enalapril and cilazapril, after short-term administration at doses sufficient to reduce circulating angiotensin II concentrations, did not alter sympathetically mediated orthostatic test, Valsalva's manoeuvre and cold pressor test, in young or elderly normotensives. Similarly, but in a separate study, the pressor, chronotropic and sympathoadrenal response to submaximal dynamic exercise were unchanged, following short-term converting enzyme inhibition in normal persons and essential hypertensive patients. These findings do not support a role for angiotensin II in presynaptic facilitation or post-junctional potentiation of noradrenergic transmission. It is proposed that the renin-angiotensin system exerts an independent, rather than a regulatory influence on sympathetic function in blood pressure control, in normal and hypertensive man.", 
    "270": "Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was studied in anesthetized dogs subjected to acute left ventricular failure and its treatment with enalaprilat (MK-422). When failure was induced a reduction in rCBF paralleling the reduction in systemic blood pressure was observed. After treatment rCBF did not change in spite of further blood pressure reduction. The results are explained by changes in vascular resistance of larger cerebral arteries. Vasoconstriction in these vessels during failure was counteracted by enalaprilat through reduction in circulating angiotensin II.", 
    "271": "This study examined the effect of exogenous AI and AII on renin synthesis and release. AII or AII + AI were given using osmotic minipumps, over a 7 day period to rats receiving oral Enalapril. Enalapril caused a marked increase in renin release and synthesis. AII abolished the rise in plasma and renal renin observed with Enalapril. AI had no inhibitory or stimulatory effect on renin release or synthesis in rats receiving Enalapril and AII.", 
    "272": "Renin secretion has been studied in the past at the level of the whole kidney, but the control of the genetic basis of renin synthesis is poorly understood. We have studied the regulation of renin gene expression in the fetus and also in the adult rat in response to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition with enalapril in the presence and absence of angiotensin II (AII). In the fetus, vascular smooth muscle cells of the renal afferent arteriole and feeder vessels contain renin mRNA and immunostain for renin. With maturation, these vessels progressively lose the capacity to synthesize renin, and only the juxtaglomerular cells retain this capacity in the adult. However, in response to ACE inhibition, the adult renal feeder vessels acquire the capacity to synthesize and secrete renin within 7 days. This effect is partially reversed with co-administration of AII. In order to study renin biosynthesis and secretion at the cellular level, we have developed a new method of study of individual renin-secreting cells, the reverse hemolytic plaque assay (RHPA). Utilizing this method, we have demonstrated that ACE inhibition with enalapril increases the number of renin secreting cells by over 15-fold at physiologic calcium concentrations. Enalapril also induced a 3-fold increase in the amount of renin released as estimated by the area of the hemolytic plaques formed. Transmission electron microscopy (EM) of the renin-secreting cell at the center of a hemolytic plaque demonstrates modified vascular smooth muscle cells with cytoplasmic granules. In summary, ACE inhibition stimulates renin mRNA accumulation and redistributes renal renin content toward that observed in early fetal life. AII inhibits renal renin mRNA accumulation. ACE inhibition increases the number of renin secreting cells as well as the amount of renin secreted by each cell. The individual renin secreting cell is a modified vascular smooth muscle cell with cytoplasmic secretory granules. Further studies of the cellular pathways for renin secretion can be provided by EM immunocytochemistry of the individual renin secreting cell.", 
    "273": "A multi-centre, randomized, double-blind, parallel group study was undertaken in order to assess efficacy and tolerability of ramipril as compared to enalapril in mild to moderate hypertension. A 4-week placebo run-in period was followed by 4 weeks of treatment with active medication (5 mg ramipril or 10 mg enalapril in a single morning dose). In patients not responding to this dosage regimen at the end of a 4-week treatment period, the dose was doubled. After 8 weeks of active medication, 3 mg daily of the diuretic piretanide was added to the treatment of patients not responding to the doubled dose. A total of 202 patients was admitted in the placebo phase from which 174 patients who had evaluable data at the end of the study were included in the efficacy analysis. Based on the definition of a 'responder' as a patient who achieved a supine diastolic blood pressure of 90 mmHg or less, 40% of those on 5 mg ramipril achieved this level within 4 weeks; in the enalapril group, the corresponding figure was 36.6%. By the end of 12 weeks of active treatment, a total of 55% of the ramipril group had responded to a daily dose of 5 to 10 mg ramipril. An additional 18% responded when 3 mg piretanide was added to the regimen. In the enalapril group, 59% responded to 10 to 20 mg enalapril. A further 17% responded to addition of piretanide to 20 mg enalapril. A total of 19 patients developed 29 adverse drug events while receiving ramipril, alone and in combination with piretanide. In the enalapril group, 24 patients developed 36 adverse events during enalapril monotherapy and combination treatment. It is concluded that ramipril and enalapril in a ratio of 1:2 have comparable antihypertensive efficacy in mild to moderate hypertension but the number of adverse reactions was slightly higher with enalapril in this study.", 
    "274": "An open, randomized, parallel clinical study comparing the antihypertensive efficacy and tolerability of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril and the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide was carried out in 40 patients with mild uncomplicated essential hypertension. Changes in plasma lipid profiles were also studied. The results show that the two treatments were equally efficacious in controlling blood pressure and were generally well tolerated. Favorable changes in the plasma lipid profile were observed during the 12-week treatment period with enalapril. However, adverse alterations in the plasma lipid profile were observed during treatment with hydrochlorothiazide. These included a significant increase in the total cholesterol/high density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio and the low density lipoprotein cholesterol/high density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio. Further studies are needed to confirm these plasma lipid findings and to determine their clinical significance.", 
    "275": "This review focuses on recent human studies with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril, prescribed either alone or in combination with a diuretic, to patients with essential hypertension and to patients with hypertension associated with moderate to severe renal parenchymal disease. Data suggest that enalapril therapy may provide a renal protective effect. In addition to lowering and controlling systemic arterial blood pressure, enalapril therapy is associated with stabilisation of, and/or improvement in effective renal plasma flow, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and urinary protein excretion. Such renal protective effects are probably mediated by normalisation of both the systemic arterial blood pressure and intraglomerular capillary hydraulic pressure, and by an increase in the glomerular ultrafiltration coefficient. Drug therapy enabling control of both systemic and glomerular hypertension may prevent hypertensive renal end-organ damage and attenuate the natural progression of renal parenchymal disease.", 
    "276": "Angiotensin-converting-enzyme(ACE)-inhibitors reduce the formation of angiotensin II from angiotensin I. These drugs cause a substantial fall in blood pressure in patients with various forms of hypertension. In particular, the combination of ACE-inhibitors with diuretics and, if necessary, additionally beta-blockers or calcium antagonists, has also been shown to be effective in patients with otherwise resistant hypertension. ACE-inhibitors may cause serious side-effects, but, on the other hand, these drugs often have a favourable effect on the quality of life during long-term treatment.", 
    "277": "Adverse effects of converting enzyme inhibitors are either substance-specific (neutropenia, proteinuria, skin rashes, taste disturbances) or due to the converting enzyme inhibition (hypotension, functional renal insufficiency, hyperkalemia, cough, angioedema). They are rare nowadays because of better knowledge of the pharmacokinetics and -dynamics of the converting enzyme inhibitors, resulting in lower dosage, and because of identifying patients at high risk. The dosage must be adjusted according to renal function, in order to prevent accumulation and toxicity. In addition to patients with renal insufficiency, patients at high risk are those with a stimulated renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, i.e. patients with renovascular hypertension or heart failure. Patients with collagen vascular disease, for example, systemic lupus erythematosus or scleroderma, should not be considered for long-term therapy with converting enzyme inhibitors because of the increased risk of neutropenia. Life-threatening angioedema may develop, mainly during the first few hours after drug administration.", 
    "278": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has long been perceived as basically humoral. Since recent findings in molecular biology extended this view to local, possibly independent, tissue-RAS, both the RAS and the kallikrein-kinin cascade are understood as mixed local-systemic interacting systems, which explains local and systemic effects of converting enzyme (CE) inhibitors well. The key enzyme of both systems, CE, catalyzes the activation of the vasopressor and possibly trophic peptide, angiotensin II, and also inactivates the vasodilatory and, according to our observations, cardioprotective bradykinin. Thus, it is consistent that CE-inhibitors lower blood pressure, reduce cardiac hypertrophy, improve metabolic state and attenuate arrhythmias, particularly in ischemic hearts. It is evident from animal experiments that the tight binding favours new oral CE inhibitors, such as ramipril, not only for prevention but also for treatment of tissue injuries due to hypertension or ischemia.", 
    "279": "Critical factors determining the renal handling of 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) are protein binding in plasma and the renal 99mTc-DMSA extraction efficiency. Comparison of the count rate over soft tissue with that over the cardiac blood pool about 1 h after injection demonstrated that 99mTc-DMSA is not exclusively an intravascular label. 99mTc-DMSA was 76% protein bound in plasma as demonstrated by HPLC and gel filtration. Assuming that the 24% that is not protein bound is filtered at the glomerulus, the renal extraction efficiency of 99mTc-DMSA by glomerular filtration is about 5%. Since the total renal extraction efficiency was also found to be about 5%, the majority of the activity that becomes fixed in the renal cortex arrives there as a result of filtration followed by tubular reabsorption rather than by direct extraction from peritubular blood. However, discordant changes in DMSA and DTPA uptake induced by captopril in renovascular hypertension (RVH) suggested that a minority of uptake was by direct peritubular extraction. This kinetic model was supported by indirect measurement of protein binding and extraction efficiency based on the kinetics of 99mTc-DMSA disappearance from plasma and kinetics of uptake in the kidneys. Furthermore, differential functional studies based on 99mTc-DMSA and 99mTc-DTPA before and after captopril in patients with RVH due to unilateral renal artery stenosis confirmed filtration followed by tubular reabsorption as the predominant route for DMSA uptake by the kidney.", 
    "280": "This study investigated the effects of hypoxia adaptation (10% O2 for 4 days) on rat lung angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) content before and after hyperoxia exposure (greater than 95% O2 for 2 days). The rationale for this investigation was that hyperoxia exposure decreases lung ACE, while hypoxia adaptation produces tolerance (improved survival) to oxygen toxicity in rats. Rats were exposed to air, hypoxia, hyperoxia alone, or hypoxia followed immediately by hyperoxia. The lungs were then excised and perfused in vitro at 12 ml/min with buffer. Lung ACE content was quantitated by measuring the single-pass binding of an iodinated ACE inhibitor, 125I-MK 351A, a derivative of lisinopril. We showed previously that 125I-MK 351A binding correlates quantitatively with ACE activity in lung homogenates and isolated, perfused lungs. Lung internal surface area was estimated by measuring the mean alveolar diameter of 5 micron hematoxylin and eosin sections from lungs fixed in inflation (25 cmH2O transpulmonary pressure). Hypoxia adaptation per se had no effect on 125I-MK 351A binding or estimated alveolar surface area, while hyperoxia exposure caused a significant decrease in both 125I-MK 351A binding and alveolar surface area. These hyperoxia-induced decreases were prevented partially by hypoxia adaptation, indicating a protective effect on both ACE content and surface area. 125I-MK 351A binding in isolated perfused lungs changed in parallel with histologically estimated surface area. These results indicate that hypoxia preadaptation minimizes the oxygen-induced decrease in lung microvascular ACE content.", 
    "281": "The renin-angiotensin system is perhaps the most important hormonal system in the regulation of blood pressure. Its influence on blood pressure is mediated by the potent vasoconstrictor angiotensin II. Since angiotensin-converting enzyme performs the last step in the biosynthesis of angiotensin II, inhibition of this enzyme has attracted the attention of many researchers as a novel approach in the control of high blood pressure. The evolution of inhibitors of this enzyme will be traced from the early snake venom peptide inhibitors to the drugs currently available for the treatment of high blood pressure and congestive heart failure.", 
    "282": "When a 35-year-old man with essential hypertension was treated with antibiotics for brucellosis his blood pressure rose significantly. While all other treatment was kept constant rifampicin was discontinued. On rechallenge rifampicin did not alter serum concentrations of enalapril or the area under the curve (AUC) between 0 and 7 h, but it did reduce the AUC of the active metabolite enalaprilat by 31%. These observations suggest that there may be an interaction between rifampicin and enalapril, causing reduced hypotensive efficacy of enalapril. The mechanism of such an interaction merits further study, but it could be due to enhanced renal clearance of enalaprilat.", 
    "283": "We have introduced enalapril, in doses equal to or less than the 2.5 mg currently recommended, as an adjuvant to digoxin and diuretics in 17 patients of mean (SD) age 83 (5) years with severe heart failure. Only eleven patients tolerated its introduction. Unlike those reported in younger patients, all but one of the adverse drug reactions occurred 8 h or more after the first dose. Aged patients started on ACE inhibitors should be observed in hospital until stabilized on a maintenance dose. Three patients had an adverse reaction which differed in nature from those previously reported: acute confusional state, ataxia and mesenteric ischaemia. Ten patients were discharged on 5 mg or 10 mg maintenance doses of enalapril. In nine of them improvement on triple therapy was sustained for a minimum of three months. ACE inhibition was lost in the other patient when her compliance with enalapril therapy fell to around 75%: monitoring compliance is essential when ACE inhibitors are used in low dosages. Enalapril was withdrawn during follow up in three patients because of symptoms of mesenteric ischaemia and in four because of dramatic deterioration of renal function. One of the latter was found subsequently to have severe bilateral atheromatous renal artery stenosis. When isosorbide dinitrate was substituted for enalapril, symptoms of mesenteric ischaemia resolved and renal function returned to baseline. Continuing surveillance for adverse effects is essential in patients of this age group with severe heart failure, and the risk of occult renal artery stenosis requires regular biochemical screening during follow up.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "284": "Twelve male hypertensive patients who had required enalapril and nifedipine to control their blood pressure were entered into a study of modified 2 x 2 factorial design (3 week study periods) to determine the effect of each drug separately and in combination. Factorial analysis indicated that enalapril alone (20 mg/d) lowered supine blood pressure by 10 +/- 2/8 +/- 1 mmHg, nifedipine alone (30 mg/d) lowered supine blood pressure by 11 +/- 2/8 +/- 1 mmHg and there was a positive interactive effect of 10 +/- 3/7 +/- 2 mmHg (P less than 0.001) such that the combination lowered supine blood pressure by 32 +/- 3/24 +/- 2 mmHg. The effects of the individual drugs were both significant (P less than 0.001) but did not differ from each other. Enalapril and nifedipine are both effective antihypertensive drugs and in some hypertensive patients their effects appear to be synergistic.", 
    "285": "A collective, multicentre (Ljubljana, Split, Zagreb) comparison of the antihypertensive effects between two angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) captopril and enalapril was made in 69 hypertensives of both sexes, having a diastolic blood pressure (DBP), following two weeks on a placebo, of between 110 and 130 mm Hg (14.7 and 17.3 kPa). There were 35 patients on enalapril (20-40 mg), and 34 on captopril (50-100 mg). Both drugs under study decreased significantly the mean DBP already after the first week of ACEI treatment (p less than 0.001). By the end of the trial (9th week) captopril had decreased the DBP in the supine position from the initial 180.3 +/- 15.3/117.7 +/- 6.4 mm Hg to 151.6 +/- 11.1/96.8 +/- 7.2 mm Hg. Enalapril had lowered the DBP more efficiently: from 182.7 +/- 16.7/118.7 +/- 7.7 to 145.6 +/- 12.8/92.2 +/- 6.4 mm Hg (p less than 0.05). The average reduction in mean DBP was 16.9% on captopril, and 20.9% on enalapril. Low dose ACEI monotherapy (i.e. 50 mg and 20 mg) achieved DBP normalization in 11.8% on captopril and in 26.4% on enalapril (p less than 0.01). There were no significant heart rate changes. The laboratory results did not change appreciably and there were no relevant side-effects, although particular attention was paid to the expected adverse reactions, such as cough, ageusia or proteinuria. It is concluded that the ACEIs under study showed comparable effectiveness within the used dose range, enalapril being more potent, longer acting, and possibly safer.", 
    "286": "We performed a randomized double-blind placebo controlled cross-over study of enalapril in 16 patients with chronic congestive heart failure, to assess haemodynamic and hormonal effects at rest and on exercise. Acute effects were measured 4 h after enalapril 10 mg, and chronic effects after 6 weeks treatment with enalapril 10-20 mg per day. Exercise tolerance, assessed by the duration of a maximal bicycle ergometer test, was not altered by enalapril. Mean blood pressure was reduced after enalapril, at rest and on exercise, acutely by 7% and 8% respectively, and chronically by 14% and 16%. Systemic vascular resistance was reduced by 16% at rest both acutely (NS) and chronically (p less than 0.05). The resting pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was reduced by 28% with chronic treatment. In the acute study, total body oxygen consumption on exercise was 26% higher after enalapril. Chronically, resting oxygen consumption was reduced by 13% after enalapril, with mixed venous oxygen saturation increasing by 16%. In the acute study enalapril increased plasma renin activity at rest and on exercise by 181% and by 189%, and reduced aldosterone by 49% (NS) and 39% (p less than 0.05), and these effects were sustained after 6 weeks. Enalapril increased antidiuretic hormone concentrations at rest acutely by 73% (NS) and chronically by 34% (p less than 0.05) but not on exercise; the increase in the acute study correlated with plasma enalaprilat levels (r = 0.66, p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "287": "The antihypertensive activity of spirapril given alone or in combination with felodipine was investigated in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) during a 3-week treatment regimen and for one week after drug withdrawal. Systolic blood pressure and heart rate were recorded once a week just before dosing and at varying time intervals up to 6 hr thereafter. Recordings were continued for one week after drug withdrawal. Spirapril alone at 1 and 5 mg/kg p.o. was found to produce dose-related antihypertensive effects throughout the treatment period. Felodipine alone at 5 mg/kg p.o. reduced blood pressure slightly more than did the low dose of spirapril. The combination of spirapril and felodipine induced a marked antihypertensive response which was greater than that observed in rats treated with either drug alone. One week after treatment withdrawal, blood pressure was at initial levels with no evidence of rebound phenomena. No significant heart rate changes were observed in the treated groups, as compared with the controls, except for an increase on the 1st day of treatment in rats given felodipine. These findings indicate that the combination of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor with a calcium antagonist leads to an effective control of hypertension over a prolonged period of treatment. Since the combination allows effectiveness with lower doses of ACE inhibitor, it is expected that the antihypertensive efficacy might be associated with a lower liability to untoward effects.", 
    "288": "1 Enalapril 20 mg, propranolol 160 mg, atenolol 50 mg and placebo each were given once a day for 8 days to 12 normal volunteers, using a Latin-square design and double-blind procedures. A battery of tests was applied before, 2 and 4 h after the dose on day 1 and 8. 2 EEG effects were detected on day 8 with propranolol but not consistently after atenolol or enalapril. 3 Reaction-time, symbol copying and memory were impaired with propranolol; only memory was marginally affected by atenolol. Enalapril impaired memory but improved tapping ability. 4 Subjectively, propranolol was associated with drowsiness, enalapril with calmness and perhaps contentedness. Ratings of headache were increased with enalapril. 5 It is concluded that the apparent beneficial subjective effects of enalapril in clinical practice are attributable partly to intrinsic central effects but mainly to the contrast with beta-adrenoceptor blockers such as propranolol.", 
    "289": "To evaluate whether hypertension is a cause or just an association with diabetic renal disease, diabetes was induced in both normotensive Wistar-Kyoto and spontaneously hypertensive rats (WKY and SHR). Animals were assessed monthly for 8 months before sacrifice. When compared to normotensive diabetic rats (WKY-STZ), hypertensive diabetic rats (SHR-STZ) had an earlier and more rapid rise in urinary albumin excretion. In addition, SHR-STZ had increased glomerular basement membrane thickness when compared to WKY-STZ or SHR. In a separate experiment, Enalapril therapy (35 mg/L) was administered in drinking water to WKY-STZ and SHR-STZ. Enalapril significantly reduced blood pressure in both animal groups, and this was associated with a decrease in urinary albumin excretion. The SHR-STZ model has accelerated nephropathy as determined by both functional and structural parameters. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition is associated with a reduction in albuminuria in both hypertensive and normotensive models of diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "290": "In a multicenter, multinational study, 200 patients with essential hypertension were treated with a fixed dose of Enalapril (E) 20 mg/day after a 2- to 4-week placebo period. All had diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 100 to 120 mm Hg at the end of the placebo period. They were then given E for 6 weeks. If DBP after this was greater than 90 mm Hg they were randomized double-blind to added therapy with hydrochlorothiazide (H) either 25 mg/day (E + H 25) or 12.5 mg/day (E + H 12.5) or placebo (E + P) for 4 weeks. Blood pressure was measured approximately 24 hours after taking the medication. In the whole group, BP fell from 171/107 to 156/97 mm Hg during monotherapy with E (P less than 0.001). Sixty-six patients reached DBP less than or equal to 90 mm Hg on E alone. Of the remainder, 42 were randomized to E + P. In these, BP fell by 5.9/3.4 mm Hg (P less than 0.05). Forty-two patients received E + H 12.5 and BP fell by 9.0/6.9 mm Hg (P less than 0.001). Forty-one patients received E + H 25 and BP fell by 5.6/6.3 mm Hg (P less than 0.05/0.01). The proportion of patients who reached DBP less than or equal to 90 mm Hg was 26% in the E + P group, 48% in the E + H 12.5 group (P less than 0.05 compared to E + P group), and 38% in the E + H 25 group. There were no other significant differences between the E + H 12.5 and E + H 25 groups except that S-potassium fell significantly (-0.2 mmol/L) in E + H 25. Both regimens were remarkably well tolerated. It can be concluded that H 12.5 mg/day potentiates the effect of Enalapril 25 mg/day at least as well as H 25 mg/day and better than placebo.", 
    "291": "In a 24-week randomized, single-blind study Timolol (n = 63) and Enalapril (n = 57) proved to be potent and safe antihypertensive drugs. However, the effect on lipid metabolism was fundamentally different, despite the fact that the effect on total serum cholesterol did not significantly differ between the two groups. Enalapril had no adverse effect on any lipid fractions, while Timolol increased very low (VLDL) + low (LDL) density lipoprotein cholesterol by 7.6% (p less than 0.001) and total triglycerides by 34.5% (p less than 0.001), and decreased the favorable high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol by 11.3% (p less than 0.001). Thus, the ratio HDL/VLDL + LDL cholesterol was reduced by 17.1% (p less than 0.001). Enalapril reduced uric acid by 3.4% (NS), while Timolol increased uric acid by 4.0% (p less than 0.05). The difference between the groups was statistically significant (p less than 0.01). The first steps in any attempt to solve the hypertension-coronary dilemma should be to take into consideration all pharmacologic effects of antihypertensive drugs.", 
    "292": "Enalapril 40 mg or tolerated dose was given once daily to 21 patients with congestive heart failure (CHF), NYHA class III, in addition to treatment with digoxin and/or diuretics. After an 8-week open period, 19 patients were randomized to continue enalapril or to receive a placebo in a double-blind manner. After the first enalapril dose of 10 mg, maximal reduction of blood pressure (BP) occurred after 4 hours (mean 34/17 mmHg; p less than 0.001). No further reduction was found after higher doses. After the open period significant improvement was shown as judged by NYHA class (p less than 0.01), stroke volume (p less than 0.05), maximal working capacity (p less than 0.05), heart volume (p less than 0.01) and maximum rate pressure product (RPPmax) (p less than 0.001). Urinary aldosterone markedly decreased (p less than 0.01), whereas serum potassium and serum creatinine slightly increased (p less than 0.05). At the end of the blind period enalapril was superior to placebo concerning NYHA class (p less than 0.01), heart volume (p less than 0.05) and RPPmax (p less than 0.05). Other parameters, including aldosterone in urine, did not differ between the groups. Carry-over effects may have diminished the differences between enalapril and placebo. Diarrhoea (n = 5) and hypotension (n = 5) were the most common side-effects. Overall, enalapril was well tolerated and seems to be useful in single daily doses in the treatment of CHF.", 
    "293": "To prevent in vitro generation of angiotensins, the renin inhibitor CGP 29287 (CGP) was added to blood sampling tubes. Plasma immunoreactive angiotensin (ir-ANG) I and II were simultaneously measured by radioimmunoassay after rapid and quantitative extraction from a single plasma sample on phenylsilylsilica (Bondelut PH). True plasma ANG-(1-8)octapeptide was determined after additional separation of the different angiotensins by high performance liquid chromatography. Ir-ANG II/CGP showed the known linear relationship with ANG-(1-8)octapeptide (r = 0.87, n = 23), but - in contrast to studies without addition of CGP - the y-axis intercept which presumably represents cross-reacting angiotensins other than ANG II was very small. Ir-ANG II/CGP concentrations fell below 1 fmol/ml after converting enzyme inhibition. The results suggest that CGP 29287 prevents in vitro generation of ANG I and ANG II as well as the ANG-metabolites. Ir-ANG I/CGP measured after Bondelut PH extraction of the plasma was strongly correlated with ir-ANG I obtained after blood ethanol extraction (r = 0.97, n = 23). Thus, it is now possible to measure reliably both ANG I and ANG II within the same plasma extract after a simple extraction procedure.", 
    "294": "We wanted to determine whether an antihypertensive therapy with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril can induce regression of hypertensive hypertrophy. 13 patients with hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy were treated with enalapril (10-40 mg/day) for 9 months. Left ventricular pump function, left ventricular hypertrophy and geometry were studied by echocardiography before and 3, 6 and 9 months after enalapril treatment had been established. Both a decrease in systolic arterial blood pressure as well as a reversal of myocardial hypertrophy was obtained. After 3 months' therapy, systolic arterial blood pressure dropped from 189 +/- 8 to 171 +/- 9 mm Hg and left ventricular muscle mass decreased from 210 +/- 13 to 196 +/- 8 g/m2. After 6 months' therapy, systolic arterial blood pressure decreased further to 154 +/- 7 mm Hg and left ventricular muscle mass to 181 +/- 8 g/m2. After another 3 months' therapy (after 9 months) no further decrease in systolic arterial blood pressure (159 +/- 9 mm Hg), and no further decrease in left ventricular muscle mass (189 +/- 8 g/m2) were obtained. After 9 months' therapy, reversal of myocardial hypertrophy was adequate in relation to the amount of blood pressure lowering. Due to unaltered ventricular loading conditions, as evidenced by identical systolic wall stress values, left ventricular pump function remained unchanged.", 
    "295": "The pharmacokinetics of lisinopril was studied after administration of single and multiple doses of 5 mg to hypertensive patients with normal and impaired renal function. In patients with severe renal failure the peak concentrations were higher, the decline in serum concentration was slower and the time to peak concentration was extended. Accumulation of lisinopril was highly correlated with the creatinine clearance. The effective half-life was doubled and tripled in patients with mild and severe renal impairment, respectively, as compared to patients with a normal renal function. Lisinopril lowered blood pressure in all three groups over 24 h. It is suggested that smaller doses of lisinopril should be administered to patients with severe renal failure.", 
    "296": "The interaction of blood pressure, salt intake and the inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme activity with cardiac hypertrophy were examined in the Dahl rat model. Eight-week-old salt sensitive and salt resistant rats were each separated into two colonies, one of which was maintained on a low salt and the other on a high salt diet for three weeks, at the end of which time both salt sensitive colonies were hypertensive. Each colony was then separated into two groups, one received no medication the other was given lisinopril until normotension was achieved. After 11 weeks of therapy, intra-arterial blood pressures and heart rates were recorded. The rats were sacrificed and heart weight to body weight ratios were determined. Both untreated salt sensitive groups displayed marked cardiac hypertrophy which correlated well with diastolic blood pressure irrespective of salt intake. Lisinopril therapy lowered blood pressures to normotensive levels in all groups except for salt sensitive rats ingesting a high salt diet where, despite a 10-fold increase in drug dose, normotension was not achieved. Significant cardiac regression accompanied lisinopril therapy in rats receiving low salt diets but high salt intake severely attenuated regression in both strains. There was no significant correlation between heart weight and blood pressure in the treated groups. The results suggest that cardiac regression appears to be mediated by other factors besides ventricular afterload pressure and that high salt intake adversely affects blood pressure and heart weight response to lisinopril therapy.", 
    "297": "Specific angiotensin II (ANG II) binding on human platelets in man was measured to examine ANG II receptor regulation in man. Eight normal volunteers received either a high, or a low sodium diet, or a low sodium diet together with the ANG I converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril. The following parameters were determined at the end of each study period: ANG II platelet receptor binding capacity (Bmax) and dissociation constant (KD); plasma-ANG II, plasma renin, plasma-aldosterone, plasma-atrial natriuretic peptide; and blood pressure (BP) increase to graded doses of i.v. given ANG II. Plasma ANG II (6 +/- 0.5, 21 +/- 4, 8 +/- 1 fmol/ml) and Bmax (14 +/- 2, 5 +/- 1, 10 +/- 2 sites/cell) changed in a reciprocal fashion on a high, low or low sodium diet with enalapril respectively. Plasma concentration of atrial natriuretic peptide was unchanged on a low sodium intake and consistently decreased when enalapril was added to the low sodium regimen. BP increase to 4 ng ANG II/kg/min was 27 +/- 3, 10 +/- 1, and 24 +/- 5 mmHg during the three study periods respectively. The data suggest that ANG II regulates maximal capacity of platelet ANG II binding. Therefore, regulation of platelet ANG II binding sites goes in parallel with, and may serve as index for, ANG II receptors on vascular smooth muscle, but ANG II receptor regulation is apparently different in adrenal cells.", 
    "298": "In 16 patients with essential hypertension the effects of enalapril 20 mg once daily were compared with those of atenolol 50 mg once daily, with the two drugs in combination and with placebo using a double-blind cross-over design with allocation of treatment order by randomised Latin squares. For each patient there were four treatment phases, each of four weeks duration, which together comprised a 2 x 2 factorial experiment. All blood pressure parameters were reduced in the three active treatment phases compared to placebo (p less than 0.001). Supine blood pressures (group means) were 171/97 (placebo), 147/85 (enalapril), 154/84 (atenolol) and 144/78 (enalapril plus atenolol) (S.E.M. +/- 2/+/- 1-ANOVA), and standing blood pressures were 170/105 (placebo), 146/92 (enalapril), 154/92 (atenolol) and 147/86 (enalapril plus atenolol) (S.E.M. +/- 3/+/- 1). In the combination phase there was an additional hypotensive response but the potential fully additive effects of the two agents were attenuated by 30-50%. The mechanism of the attenuated hypotensive effect of the combined agents has not been determined. Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) concentration was doubled in the presence of atenolol (P less than 0.01) suggesting that ANP may contribute to the hypotensive effect of the beta-blocker.", 
    "299": "In a double-blind study, twenty-four ASA 1 and II patients scheduled for otosclerosis surgery were randomized in two groups according to the premedication given orally 1 h before anaesthesia: placebo (group P; n = 12) or 25 mg captopril (group C; n = 12). Anaesthesia was induced with thiopentone, fentanyl and vecuronium and was maintained, after oral tracheal intubation, with N2O/O2 (50/50); 5 min after intubation, the inspired halothane concentration (FIH) was set at 1.8-2% in order to obtain a mean arterial pressure (Pa) of 45-55 mmHg; thereafter, FIH was increased or decreased (+/- 0.5% every 3 min) in order to maintain this Pa value. Ventilation was controlled in order to assure normocapnia (35-40 mmHg). Inspired and expired (FEH) halothane concentrations were monitored by an halothane analyser. The plasma renin (ARP) and conversion enzyme activities (AEC) were measured before anaesthesia (ARP1, AEC1), 5 min (ARP2) and 55 min (ARP3, AEC2) after the start of anaesthesia. In group C, AEC1 and AEC2 were reduced by half, confirming the efficiency of captopril in inhibiting the conversion enzyme. ARP1 and ARP2 were increased in group C (5.42 +/- 4.2 and 9.92 +/- 7.35 micrograms.l-1.h-1. ARP3 increased in both groups (20.75 +/- 8.42 micrograms.l-1.h-1 in group C, and 24.60 +/- 15.40 in group P). Pa decreased to 55 mmHg more rapidly in group C (9 min in group C; 18 min in group P; p less than 0.05) and FEH could be reduced by a third (1.38 +/- 0.29% in group P; 0.90 +/- 0.17% in group C; p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "300": "The aldosterone secretory response to Captopril (12.5 mg, orally) was studied in five normal men. Endogenous ACTH and epinephrine secretion was stimulated by the induction of hypoglycemia. Normally this stimulus increases plasma cortisol, GH, aldosterone, and PRA. Administration of captopril resulted in a blunted plasma aldosterone response to hypoglycemia, but no concomitant blunting of the plasma cortisol response. The responses of other hormones, with the exception of PRA, were not affected. When exogenous ACTH was administered to the same men with and without captopril, the plasma aldosterone response was again blunted by captopril, while the plasma cortisol response was unaffected. We conclude that angiotensin II may be required for ACTH to stimulate aldosterone secretion. Alternatively, the possibility that captopril may selectively inhibit aldosterone secretion at the adrenal cellular level cannot be excluded.", 
    "301": "To assess the vascular involvement of renin-angiotensin system inhibition in human hypertension, acute effects of intravenous enalaprilat on brachial artery diameter, blood flow, and blood velocity were investigated in hypertensive patients by pulsed Doppler technique and compared with effects of saline vehicle. Compared with saline vehicle, enalaprilat reduced blood pressure (P less than 0.001) and increased brachial arterial diameter (P less than 0.01) and brachial blood flow (P less than 0.01). Enalaprilat effect on arterial pulse pressure was dependent on preinjection pulse pressure (r = -0.76; P less than 0.001), but its effect on mean blood pressure was not dependent on preinjection mean blood pressure. On the other hand, enalaprilat effect on arterial blood flow was negatively correlated with preinjection blood pressure (r = -0.64; P less than 0.02). The findings point to different responses of large and small arteries to intravenous enalaprilat.", 
    "302": "Airway responses to rapid intravenous infusions of substance P (SP), selected carboxy terminal fragments (SP3-11, SP5-11, SP7-11, and SP9-11), and an amino terminal fragment (SP1-9) were measured in anesthetized, mechanically ventilated guinea pigs. The dose of each peptide required to decrease pulmonary conductance (GL) to 50% of baseline value was calculated in each animal. The order of ED50GL was: SP5-11 less than SP3-11 less than SP less than SP7-11. SP9-11 and SP1-9 were inactive at doses up to 1000 nmol/kg i.v. The effects of the neutral metalloendopeptidase (NEP) inhibitor, thiorphan, and the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, captopril, on airway responses to SP5-11 were examined in order to test the hypothesis that differences in degradation of SP and SP5-11 contribute to the difference in airway responsiveness to the two peptides. Thiorphan (0.5 mg/animal, i.v.) caused a significant decrease in ED50GL for SP5-11, as has been previously noted for SP. In contrast, captopril (1.7 mg/animal i.v.) had no effect on ED50GL for SP5-11, although it has a substantial effect on SP responses. These results indicate that while the carboxy terminal of SP is essential for peptide bronchoactivity, loss of amino terminal peptides (up to four residues) actually enhances bronchoconstrictor responses to the peptide. Part of this enhancement appears to result from differences in the degradation of SP and SP5-11 by ACE. The data suggest that cleavage of SP by dipeptidyl aminopeptidases could enhance its bioactivity.", 
    "303": "Experience with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor drugs as with other antihypertensive agents, is limited in the elderly. Nevertheless, they appear effective and well tolerated but without evidence to suggest that they have any special role in the elderly compared to a younger age group. Most are excreted through the kidney and dosage should be reduced to match glomerular function. ACE inhibitors seem likely to be used increasingly in the elderly, especially when more traditional agents are contraindicated because of concomitant disease.", 
    "304": "In spite of the fact that plasma renin activity declines with age and drugs whose action is mediated via the renin-angiotensin system might be expected to be less effective with increasing age, the limited available data suggest that both captopril and enalapril lower blood pressure in the elderly. The quantity and the quality of data to compare hypotensive effects in the young and elderly leave much to be desired. It might be predicted that adverse effects such as hypotension and exacerbation of preexisting renal failure could pose problems for the use of these drugs in the elderly, but documentation of this is also sparse. Clearly, this area of risk versus benefit of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in the elderly requires further study.", 
    "305": "During the last few years, there has been a growing awareness that treated hypertensive patients are still at substantially increased risks for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and that one conceivable explanation for this is that their blood pressure has not been lowered to strictly normotensive levels. To obtain normotensive blood pressures, it may be necessary to skillfully combine antihypertensive drugs much more frequently than has been common so far. In this context, calcium antagonists in combination with beta-blockers are of special interest, since several controlled studies have shown that a combination between a beta-blocker and nifedipine, nitrendipine, isradipine, or felodipine have been remarkably potent as regards their antihypertensive effect. In controlled trials, such combinations have also been shown to be more effective and better tolerated than a combination between a beta-blocker and hydralazine. Marked efficacy has also been noted when a calcium antagonist has been combined with an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. So far, most studies have dealt with small numbers of patients and study design has not always been optimal. Results from controlled studies will presumably be ready for presentation in the near future. It can be concluded that combination therapy between calcium antagonists and beta-blockers or ACE inhibitors appear to be markedly effective and well tolerated. This would offer the possibility of reducing elevated arterial pressure to normotensive levels in many hypertensive patients.", 
    "306": "There is evidence from several studies of the clinical usefulness of an antihypertensive regimen combining a calcium antagonist and an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. The mechanisms of this mutual potentiation between agents of these two classes are probably numerous. First, dihydropyridines cause a variable amount of reflex sympathetic activation, whereas ACE inhibitors blunt sympathetic activity at different central and peripheral levels. Second, dihydropyridines produce an almost exclusive arteriolar dilatation, and a more balanced arteriolar and venous dilatation might result from their association with an ACE inhibitor. Finally, stimulation of renin release and the consequent generation of angiotensin II are facilitated by dihydropyridines, and this increased generation of angiotensin II can be blocked by ACE inhibition. More limited information is available on the doses of calcium antagonist and ACE inhibitor that are best suited for combined therapy. Careful studies should be performed to compare the dose-response curves of either agent to be combined and of possible dose combinations, particularly if combinations of agents of the two classes are planned in the same tablet.", 
    "307": "In essential hypertension, ventricular function is determined primarily by the degree of hypertrophy (myocardial factor) and by the organic complications in the coronary artery (coronary factor). Ventricular function is inversely correlated with ventricular size and systolic wall stress, inasmuch as ventricular function diminishes when these two variables increase. Coronary reserve is reduced even in hypertensive hypertrophy without evidence of coronary artery disease. MVO2 per mass unit is directly correlated with systolic wall stress per cross-sectional area of the left ventricular wall. It is concluded that the appropriateness of left ventricular hypertrophy, as a result of mass-to-volume ratio and stress, is a major determinant of left ventricular performance, of coronary blood flow, and of myocardial oxygen consumption. Pharmacotherapeutical means of reversing cardiac hypertrophy (prazosin, clonidine, enalapril, and nifedipine) were analyzed in concentrically, as well as eccentrically, hypertrophied left ventricles. Regression of cardiac hypertrophy, i.e., therapeutic intervention on a critical precursor of hypertensive congestive heart failure, can be obtained by various antihypertensive agents. Prazosin, calcium channel blockers, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors as well as a combined treatment regimen using alpha-receptor blockers together with diuretics and vasodilators can all induce regression of hypertrophy associated with an improvement in left ventricular function. Moreover, an improved coronary reserve may reduce the ischemic risk of the hypertrophied myocardium. However, not all antihypertensive drugs seem equally effective in bringing about coronary regression of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). No regression or little regression has been found with diuretic monotherapy despite a satisfactory reduction in blood pressure. On the other hand, a trend towards a regression has been observed in patients in whom treatment with clonidine significantly reduced catecholamines. Recent experimental data in spontaneously hypertensive rats indicate that the impaired coronary reserve can be significantly improved by the long-term administration of blood pressure lowering agents, e.g., by nifedipine or by the combination of metoprolol plus hydralazine.", 
    "308": "The effects of nitrendipine (10 mg b.i.d.) on blood pressure, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and kidney function (by means of glomerular and tubular function) were studied in comparison to captopril (50 mg b.i.d.) and to nitrendipine (10 mg q.d.) + captopril (25 mg b.i.d.) in 30 untreated essential mild-to-moderate hypertensives. The blood pressure lowering effect was similar with either regimen. Nitrendipine showed an acute and chronic natriuretic effect not accompanied by modifications of kidney function. All regimens were well tolerated by the patients without any appreciable side effects over the 4-week study period.", 
    "309": "Nitrendipine and cilazapril are two new antihypertensive drugs with different mechanisms of action. Nitrendipine is a calcium antagonist of the dihydropyridine class which decreases directly the smooth muscle tone. Cilazapril is a new long-lasting inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme which suppresses the peripheral vasoconstrictor effect of angiotensin I by inhibiting its transformation in angiotensin II. The goal of the present study was to assess the effects on hemodynamics and regional blood flows (measured with radioactive microspheres) of cilazapril and nitrendipine given alone or in combination. Cilazapril (3 mg/kg) and nitrendipine (0.3 mg/kg) were given intravenously to conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats first alone, then in combination. Both cilazapril and nitrendipine decreased mean arterial pressure to the same extent. Cilazapril increased regional blood flow only in the kidney without changing total cardiac output. In contrast, nitrendipine increased regional blood flow in nearly every organ and markedly enhanced total cardiac output. Cilazapril redistributed the cardiac output distribution toward the kidney, and nitrendipine did not change the cardiac output distribution. The combination of both nitrendipine and cilazapril produced a stronger antihypertensive effect than each drug alone. The peripheral vasodilatation with the combination was not as marked as with nitrendipine alone but was associated with the same redistribution of the cardiac output toward the kidney as with cilazapril. We conclude that after acute intravenous administration the combination of cilazapril and nitrendipine produced hemodynamic effects which cannot be induced by each drug used alone. Such a therapeutic profile may be useful in patients with high blood pressure or heart failure.", 
    "310": "The possible effects of cimetidine on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of enalapril, a pro-drug requiring hepatic de-esterification to an active angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalaprilat, were assessed in a randomized, crossover study. Cimetidine (400 mg) or placebo was administered orally every 12 h for 3 days and on the day of a single oral administration of enalapril maleate (10 mg) to seven healthy male subjects. Serum ACE, plasma renin activity (PRA), plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC), and alpha-human atrial natriuretic peptide (alpha-hANP) were measured before and 4 h after the enalapril dosing. There were no significant differences in any serum- and urine-derived kinetic parameters of enalapril and enalaprilat, nor in hemodynamics, PAC, or alpha-hANP between the two treatment trials. ACE decreased and PRA increased to a similar extent in the two trials. Serum enalaprilat concentration correlated significantly (p less than 0.001) with percentage of inhibition of ACE activity. The results suggest that the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of enalapril are unaffected by preadministration of cimetidine. Thus, cimetidine does not appear to alter hepatic esterase activity toward enalapril.", 
    "311": "Amlodipine 10 mg once daily added to captopril 25 mg twice daily for 4 weeks in patients with moderate to severe hypertension significantly improved blood pressure control (by -18/-12 and -20/-12 mm Hg for supine and standing systolic/diastolic pressures respectively, p less than 0.001). Few side effects related to amlodipine were noted and none was serious.", 
    "312": "The first inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) was found in and isolated from the venom of the South American pit viper Bothrops jararaca. This was done after it was discovered that bites of the pit viper inhibit the breakdown of a proinflammatory peptide, bradykinin, in prey. Treatment with newly developed orally active ACE-inhibitors has been reported to cause symptoms such as adverse skin reactions, angioneurotic oedema, coughs and, in asthmatics, rapidly decreasing lung function. In this thesis the ACE-inhibitor MK 422 (active parent diacid of enalapril) was demonstrated to potentiate wheal and flare reactions induced by allergens, bradykinin or capsaicin, and to increase infiltration of \"inflammatory cells\", like eosinophils and neutrophils, into inflammatory dermal test sites in sensitized guinea pigs. MK 422 also augmented spontaneous and allergen-triggered histamine release in vitro from guinea pig skin and lung tissue. Capsaicin \"desensitization\" of guinea pig skin markedly reduced the wheal and flare reactions to allergens and attenuated the proinflammatory effect of the ACE-inhibitor. The histamine release in vitro from capsaicin-pretreated skin was also decreased, and no clear potentiating effect of MK 422 was demonstrated. In man, enalapril augmented anti-IgE-induced wheal and flare responses and increased bronchial reactivity to histamine. The drop of circulating eosinophils in venous blood was more pronounced after the provocations performed during enalapril treatment, and plasma substance P tended to increase. The alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine, known to attenuate \"neurogenic inflammation\", reduced the wheal and flare reactions in guinea pig skin and decreased infiltration of neutrophils and eosinophils into inflammatory test sites. Furthermore, clonidine abolished the proinflammatory effect of MK 422 on the allergen- evoked wheal and flare reactions in guinea pig skin without counteracting the blood pressure lowering effect of the ACE-inhibitor. Contrarily, an additive hypotensive effect was demonstrated when clonidine was combined with MK 422. It is suggested that the proinflammatory properties demonstrated by ACE-inhibitors is due to augmentation of \"neurogenic inflammation\".", 
    "313": "Peripheral vasodilation has proved to be a successful method to control hypertension in recent years, as illustrated by the increasing number of marketed vasodilators like calcium antagonists, alpha-adrenergic antagonists, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. A novel group of vasodilators showing excellent antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats and renal hypertensive dogs has been discovered. The first compounds of the group were pyridylthioureas. Chemical modification based on structure-activity studies involving a substitution of N-cyanoguanidine for the less active thiourea function has led to the synthesis of pinacidil, N'-cyano-N-(4-pyridyl)-N\"-(1,2,2-trimethylpropyl) guanidine, recently introduced as the new antihypertensive drug, Pindac. Preclinical studies showed that pinacidil does not relax vascular smooth muscle by any known mechanism, but recent investigations indicate that the compound opens potassium channels in the cell membranes. The hyperpolarization that follows is responsible for the relaxation. Pinacidil is rapidly and almost completely absorbed after oral administration and produces a dose-dependent blood pressure fall in hypertensive animals and humans. The therapeutic plasma concentrations are in the range of those producing relaxation of isolated, noradrenalin-contracted human blood vessels in vitro. In dogs, pinacidil decreases vascular resistance in most tissues proportionally to the blood pressure fall, but elicits a specific increase in coronary blood flow at antihypertensive doses. The compound shows a selectivity for precapillary vessels. It is mainly eliminated by hepatic metabolism to pinacidil-N-oxide followed by renal excretion, and the N-oxidation is partly reversible. Pinacidil is relatively free of toxicity, and action-related side effects such as fluid retention and tachycardia are readily controlled with diuretics and beta-blockers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "314": "A patient suffering from rheumatoid arthritis and hypertension is described who developed pemphigus foliaceus during simultaneous treatment with d-penicillamine and captopril. Discontinuation of the d-penicillamine afforded some improvement, but skin symptoms still persisted after 3 months. When the captopril was discontinued as well, all lesions healed within 2 weeks. Our findings suggest that both these chemically related drugs might have been responsible for the pemphigus-like eruption in this patient.", 
    "315": "Immunohistological study of dermal infiltrate from two pemphigus- and one captopril-induced lichenoid eruption showed the presence of a CD8 (T suppressor) infiltrate that resembled that found in skin eruptions induced by graft-versus-host disease. It is suggested that a T cell cytotoxic reaction occurs in the epidermis that might be triggered by captopril-induced modification of keratinocytic antigens.", 
    "316": "Enoximone (MDL 17043, 150 mg t.d.s.) and captopril (25 mg t.d.s.) were compared as additional treatment to diuretics in 13 patients with severe chronic heart failure in a cross-over, double-blind, and randomised trial. Each treatment was continued for one month. Heart failure was due to cardiomyopathy in six patients and ischaemic heart disease in seven. Exercise capacity and central haemodynamics at rest and on exercise were measured on entry to the study and after each treatment period. Cardiac index at peak exercise time and peak oxygen consumption were increased by both drugs, but there were no differences in these increases between the two drugs after one month's treatment. Minor differences were found in the biochemical and hormonal response to the two drugs. Those patients who improved on captopril also improved on enoximone.", 
    "317": "Dog, monkey and human aortic tissues contained two distinct types of angiotensin II-generating enzymes; angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and chymostatin-sensitive angiotensin II-generating enzyme (CAGE). Endothelium, media and adventitia of canine thoracic aortae were separated using collagenase digestion, and determined for their ACE and CAGE activity. ACE activity was assayed by hippuryl-His-Leu cleavage. CAGE activity was estimated with ANG I as substrate in the presence of inhibitors of ACE and angiotensinases. His-Leu, the common product of both enzyme reactions, was fluorimetrically quantified after o-phthalaldehyde condensation. ACE localized mainly in endothelium, while CAGE distributed predominantly in adventitia. Similar results were obtained with human and monkey aortae. Such a contrasting distribution may indicate the distinct functional role of these two enzymes.", 
    "318": "In insulin-dependent diabetics the course of the renal disease can be followed by measuring arterial blood pressure and urinary albumin excretion. Already at the stage of incipient nephropathy (microalbuminuria) a moderate but gradually increasing rise in blood pressure is noticeable. At the stage of patent nephropathy (macroalbuminuria) nothing but an effective antihypertensive treatment can slow down the deterioration of renal function and delay by a few years the occurrence of end-stage renal failure. When macroproteinuria or obvious arterial hypertension are present, it is much too late to institute an antihypertensive treatment. To really prevent diabetic nephropathy, this treatment must be given earlier, as soon as microalbuminuria is detected and irrespective of blood pressure values. Prescribing antihypertensive drugs, and especially angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, seems to be the most effective way of reducing urinary albumin excretion. 6", 
    "319": "In order to discover more about the role of the sympathetic nervous and renin-angiotensin systems in the preservation of homeostasis during chronic reductions of salt intake, blood pressure, blood catecholamines and renin activity were measured in a group of healthy subjects in normal conditions and on a salt-free diet combined with blockade of the conversion enzyme by enalapril. The results confirmed the hypothesis advanced on an earlier occasion i.e. that both hormone systems contribute to pressure during salt depletion in the initial phase, while over the long term only the renin-angiotensin system is activated though when this is inhibited, the sympathetic nervous system will take over its function.", 
    "320": "An examination of the literature provides the basis for a definition of first dose iatrogenic hypotension or \"first dose syndrome\", its nature, degree and frequency. The drugs that often cause this phenomenon are listed with details of the mechanisms involved as are the physiological, pathological and iatrogenic conditions that may trigger and/or exacerbate the gravity and duration of the syndrome. In a series of patients with essential arterial hypertension treated with ACE inhibitors, 6 developed first dose syndrome, two of them after captopril and 4 after enalapril maleate, two of whom were also receiving theophylline and nitro derivates. Though wide personal experience suggests that first dose syndrome caused by ACE inhibitors is a rare event and those drugs are undeniably effective and well tolerated, treatment should always start with minimum doses administered before bed time especially in patients receiving other medication and/or presenting the physiological or pathological conditions in which first dose syndrome has already been observed and described.", 
    "321": "Both traditional and newer treatments of essential hypertension are discussed in relation to kidney function and renal perfusion. In essential hypertension, renal vascular resistance is routinely increased and renal blood flow is often decreased. Reduced sodium intake as a form of therapy will cause a decrease in both renal blood flow and glomerular filtration, most likely due to an angiotensin-induced renal vasoconstriction caused by the reactive increase in renin release. Treatment with diuretics produces the same effects, also angiotensin-mediated. The addition of a beta-adrenergic blocking agent to prevent renin release may be a good choice, but individual agents within this class must be examined for direct renal vasoconstriction. The effects of \"nonspecific\" vasodilators on renal perfusion and renal sodium handling vary with the patient but may produce antinatriuresis, sodium retention and decrease in glomerular filtration. Studies with calcium antagonists have shown promising results. Nifedipine studies show a substantial increase in renal plasma flow, a well-maintained glomerular filtration rate and a brisk diuresis and natriuresis. However, patients with the lowest baseline renal flow do not show these benefits. Diltiazem has shown a potentiated renal vascular response in normotensive patients of hypertensive parents. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors such as captopril and enalapril have produced increased renal blood flow and well-maintained glomerular filtration in patients with essential hypertension. The agents available for treating hypertension have improved dramatically in the past decade. A salutary effect on the kidney will remain high on the list of important characteristics to be considered in choosing one of these agents.", 
    "322": "Because of the growing number of antihypertensive agents that are suitable for initial therapy in mild and moderate hypertension, it is important to identify factors that influence the response to various medications. Although individual patient considerations, such as associated illnesses and potential side effects, are of primary importance in choosing therapy, the influence of demographic factors has received increasing attention. The effect of age, race and gender on the response to antihypertensive therapy will be examined. Several studies have indicated that the beta blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are more effective in younger than in older patients. Conversely, there is a trend toward greater responses in older subjects to the diuretics and calcium antagonists. In the few studies available that have compared agents in various classes, it appears that diuretics, and probably calcium antagonists, are significantly more effective than beta blockers or ACE inhibitors in patients over 60 years of age. However, the interdrug differences in young patients are probably less important. With regard to race, the relative lack of effect of beta blockers and ACE inhibitors in blacks is well accepted; in comparative studies, diuretics proved significantly better. From the few available studies, it does not appear that the calcium antagonists are more potent in either racial group, but they may be superior to the beta blockers and ACE inhibitors in blacks. Far less information is available concerning differences in antihypertensive responses between men and women. There is some suggestion that women may be less responsive to beta blockers than men.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "323": "Decreased angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity is a common finding in patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome and in animal models of lung injury. The nature of this effect is unknown. Intravascular fibrin, also a common finding in lung injury, is degraded to small peptides by proteolytic enzymes. Peptide 6A, corresponding to amino acid residues 43 to 47 of the B beta chain of fibrin(ogen), is produced by plasmin degradation of fibrin and has been shown to inhibit ACE in vitro. We investigated the effect of this peptide on the pulmonary hydrolysis of a synthetic ACE substrate, benzoyl-phenylalanyl-alanyl-proline, in anesthetized rabbits and in isolated, perfused rabbit lungs. Peptide 6A caused a reversible, dose-dependent inhibition of benzoyl-phenylalanyl-alanyl-proline hydrolysis. It also potentiated the increase in pulmonary arterial pressure and the decrease in systemic arterial pressure due to bradykinin (BK), as well as the increase in pulmonary artery pressure due to BK in isolated lungs. The amount of BK needed to increase pulmonary arterial pressure was about 1000-fold larger in the isolated lung than in the intact animal. Peptides of this type might contribute to decreased ACE activity in patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome and may potentiate BK-mediated hemodynamic changes in these patients.", 
    "324": "Treatment of heart failure comprises the use of diuretics, vasodilators and inotropic substances. Unloading of the heart and the circulation in hydropic states is classically achieved with diuretics. The retention of salt and water in chronic heart failure requires chronic treatment with diuretics. This mode of treatment is basic to all forms of hydropic heart failure. Inotropic substances such as digitalis glycosides, sympathomimetic amines or phosphodiesterase inhibitors have certain disadvantages: Inotropic stimulation increases energy demand of the working heart muscle. Most of the substances used today increase energy consumption inordinately, thereby decreasing economy of myocardial contraction. This aspect calls for caution in the application of these substances in chronic heart failure, although they seem indispensable (sympathomimetic amines) in acute hypotensive failure and shock. Digitalis glycosides, basically suited for longterm treatment, exert only mild inotropic effects. In addition inotropic stimulation brings with it arrhythmogenic effects. All inotropic substances can induce ventricular arrhythmias already at therapeutic levels. Vasodilating substances have found increasing acceptance as a particularly useful and safe group of drugs for the treatment of heart failure. Nitrates: With the different nitrate compounds and nitrate preparations an effective venodilation with preload reduction can safely be achieved. At higher doses, arteriolar also dilatation can be induced. Although tolerance may be a problem with chronic application, this can be avoided with prudent dosing. The strong venodilating property makes these drugs together with their rapid onset of action ideally suited for the treatment of acute heart failure with pulmonary congestion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "325": "Eight diabetic subjects with moderately elevated blood pressure (BP) (systolic (SBP) greater than 140 and/or diastolic (DBP) greater than 90 mmHg) were studied. Each had evidence of mild asymptomatic autonomic neuropathy (impairment of forced sinus arrhythmia). The effect of a single oral 25 mg dose of captopril on BP and some aspects of autonomic function was compared with matched placebo in a double-blind, cross-over study. Resting supine SBP and DBP fell significantly (P less than 0.01) over 90 minutes following captopril, indicating that the hypotensive effect of the drug was not dependent on intact autonomic function. There was no significant change in resting heart rate. The bradycardic response to apnoeic face immersion was significantly (P less than 0.01) enhanced following captopril. Sinus arrhythmia did not change. The BP responses to standing and to the cold pressor test were unaffected. There was no exacerbation of postural hypotension. The ingestion of a single dose of captopril appears to increase vagal function, without affecting sympathetic nervous function, in diabetics with evidence of mild vagal impairment.", 
    "326": "To compare the hemodynamic mode of action of captopril in patients with Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) with high- or low-plasma renin activity, we studied the systemic and renal hemodynamic changes induced by this drug in patients with refractory CHF (Group I) or untreated CHF (Group II). Plasma Renin Activity (PRA) was 7.46 +/- 3.7 ng/ml/hr in Group I and 1.15 +/- 0.45 ng/ml/hr in Group II. After the administration of captopril, these values increased to 14.35 +/- 6.19 and to 1.99 +/- 0.76 ng/ml/hr respectively (p less than 0.05). We observed that patients of Group I responded with increases in cardiac index and stroke volume and diminutions in total peripheral resistance, but Group II did not show any significant change in these variables. In contrast to this difference in responses between the refractory and untreated patients, both groups showed similar decreases in pulmonary artery and wedge pressures. Both groups also showed similar increases in plasma volume and effective renal plasma flow, and decreases in renal vascular resistance. These results show that captopril has predominantly venodilator effects in patients with CHF with low PRA levels, and it acts as a mixed vasodilator in patients refractory to conventional therapy, receiving high doses of diuretics, and in whom PRA is elevated. Our results also suggest that the venodilator action of captopril is not mediated by the Renin-Angiotensin System.", 
    "327": "Captopril, a sulfhydryl compound that lowers blood pressure by inhibiting the zinc metalloenzyme, angiotensin converting enzyme, may occasionally result in ageusia, a symptom also associated with zinc deficiency. We therefore studied serum zinc and copper concentrations in a group of 14 essential hypertensive subjects before treatment and after 5-6 months of antihypertensive oral monotherapy with either captopril (50 mg, twice daily; n = 7) or other drugs (propranolol or alphamethyldopa; n = 7). Serum zinc and copper were unaltered by either regimen. Thus, zinc depletion is an unlikely consequence of long-term exposure to captopril, at least in the dosages commonly used for treatment of hypertension.", 
    "328": "Since an understanding of the pathogenesis of essential hypertension is unlikely to be imminent, there is little chance that antihypertensive therapy will become curative in the near future. What progress can be expected in symptomatic therapy? In the past, nearly all major mechanisms involved in the regulation of blood pressure have become targets of antihypertensive drugs; they include the sympathetic neuro-effector system, neuronal substrates of central cardiovascular regulation, the kidney, the renin angiotensin aldosterone system and the vascular smooth muscle cell. Among drugs that influence the function of the sympathetic nervous system, the clinical potential of one mechanism of action has not yet been explored: it is the inhibition of noradrenaline release through stimulation of inhibitory receptors located at the adrenergic nerve terminals of the cardiovascular system (inhibitory presynaptic receptors). Among the multiple presynaptic receptors, dopamine receptors appear to be a particularly interesting target. The not entirely expected activity of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in essential hypertension prompted the search for renin inhibitors. Whether interruption of the cascade of the renin angiotensin system at the first reaction step by renin inhibitors, as compared to the interference at the second step by ACE inhibitors, will yield relevant progress in antihypertensive drug therapy remains to be seen.", 
    "329": "It has been proposed that medullary washout secondary to increased blood flow will limit maximal urine osmolality and reabsorption of salt and water from the inner medullary collecting duct. We have tested this prediction. The function of the inner medullary collecting duct was examined by microcatheterization. Acetylcholine was infused directly into the renal circulation, captopril was infused intravenously, and angiotensin II was infused into the renal circulation in rats which also received captopril. Medullary plasma flow rate, measured by dye-dilution in parallel experiments, was not significantly increased by acetylcholine; it was increased 30% (p less than 0.02) by systemic infusion of captopril, and was returned to control by angiotensin II. Acetylcholine increased both urine flow rate and sodium excretion (p less than 0.01, p less than 0.001, respectively), while captopril increased only sodium excretion (p less than 0.025). Angiotensin II blocked the natriuresis due to captopril. None of the treatments altered urine osmolality (p greater than 0.4 in all cases). Acetylcholine increased the loads of water, sodium, chloride, and total solute delivered to the inner medullary collecting duct. Angiotensin II reduced delivery of water and solutes compared with captopril alone. None of the treatments affected load dependency of reabsorption of water, sodium, chloride, or total solute in the inner medullary collecting duct. We conclude that there is, at most, a weak interaction between medullary blood flow and reabsorption from the inner medullary collecting duct.", 
    "330": "1. Electrical stimulation of the brachial nerves at 3 Hz (15 V, 0.2 ms), in sodium pentobarbitone-anaesthetized rats whose renal arterial pressure was held constant, elicited a 26% increase in systemic blood pressure, a 15% rise in heart rate, an 11% reduction in renal blood flow, did not alter glomerular filtration rate and significantly reduced absolute and fractional sodium excretions and urine flow by 44, 49 and 31%, respectively. 2. In a separate group of rats, brachial nerve stimulation at 3 Hz increased plasma renin activity approximately 2-fold, while in animals in which the brachial nerves were not stimulated plasma renin activity did not change. 3. Following inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system with captopril or sar-1-ile-8-angiotensin II, brachial nerve stimulation resulted in similar increases in systemic blood pressure and heart rate as in the animals with an intact renin-angiotensin system but, in captopril-infused rats, did not change renal haemodynamics or urine flow while absolute and fractional sodium excretions were reduced by 20 and 25%, respectively. In sar-1-ile-8-angiotensin II-infused animals, similar nerve stimulation decreased renal blood flow by 12%, glomerular filtration rate by 7% and absolute and fractional sodium excretions and urine flow by 25, 18 and 18%, respectively. These decreases in sodium and water output were significantly smaller than those observed in animals with an intact renin-angiotensin system. 4. Stimulation of the brachial nerves increased post-ganglionic efferent renal nerve activity by 20% and the magnitude of this response was unaffected following inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. 5. The results show that low rates of brachial nerve stimulation in the rat can increase efferent renal nerve activity and result in an antinatriuresis and antidiuresis which is dependent on the presence of angiotensin II, and appears to be due to an action of angiotensin II at the level of the kidney.", 
    "331": "In this study we compared the antihypertensive efficacy and tolerability of captopril at 25 mg twice daily, hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), 12.5 mg twice daily and placebo in a multicentre, double-blind, randomized study that included 152 essential hypertensive patients (77 males, 75 females, 87 WHO stage I, 65 WHO stage II, aged 69 +/- 4 years, mean +/- s.d.). Supine and standing blood pressure were similarly reduced by captopril and HCTZ (P less than 0.01 for both compared with placebo). The heart rate did not change. Captopril (25-30 mg twice daily) and HCTZ (12.5 mg twice daily), alone or in combination, maintained their antihypertensive effect during a 24-week single-blind follow-up study. During the follow-up, diastolic blood pressure remained less than 100 mmHg in seven essential hypertensives on placebo, in 45 on captopril and in 25 on HCTZ. Side effects were observed in seven essential hypertensives during placebo (treatment withdrawn in two), in eight during HCTZ and in three during captopril. Serum potassium was reduced (P less than 0.05) and uric acid was increased (P less than 0.01) only during HCTZ. We conclude that captopril and HCTZ have similar antihypertensive efficacy in the elderly; however, captopril appears to be better tolerated.", 
    "332": "In order to evaluate the antihypertensive effect and the tolerability of combination therapy with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (captopril) and a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist (nifedipine) compared with monotherapy and placebo, we studied 32 uncomplicated essential hypertensives. At the end of a 1-month placebo washout period, their diastolic blood pressure was greater than 105 and less than 120 mmHg. The subjects then received, according to a double-blind randomized crossover design, captopril (50 mg twice daily), nifedipine (20 mg twice daily), captopril plus nifedipine at the same doses and the corresponding placebo, each treatment being given for 1 month. Both captopril and nifedipine significantly reduced mean blood pressure, which was further and significantly reduced by the combination of the two drugs. The decreases in mean blood pressure induced by nifedipine were significantly greater than those induced by captopril, and those induced by the combined therapy were significantly greater than those induced by either drug on monotherapy. The heart rate was significantly increased only by nifedipine, and to a similar, but not significant, extent by the combination therapy. Plasma renin activity was similarly and significantly increased and urinary aldosterone tended to decrease to a similar extent under the three active treatments. Adverse effects were mild to moderate in intensity; their incidence under captopril was lower than that under placebo, while the incidence under nifedipine and combined therapy was greater than under placebo. Ankle oedema disappeared under the combined therapy in three out of four patients who developed this side effect under nifedipine, although one additional patient developed ankle oedema under combination therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "333": "Because of the advance of techniques and age-matched apparatus for blood pressure measurement, and because of the availability of age-related normal values in childhood, the knowledge of the number of children having elevated blood pressures has recently improved. In a group of healthy children, the first important task is to determine how many incidences of \"essential hypertension\" there are among them, which may appear in childhood and persist into adulthood. This should urge us to undertake periodical examinations of healthy children. On the other hand, the treatment of \"secondary hypertension\" has similarly been improved. Since 1979 in particular, captopril, an orally active angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor, has successfully been administered to treat children with malignant hypertension and who respond poorly to conventional antihypertensive therapies. We report 3 cases that received captopril for refractory hypertension: a 2-year-old boy with renal and renovascular anomalies, a 7-year-old boy with moyamoya disease after surgical operation, and a 17-year-old youth with Cushingoid syndrome due to chronic administration of steroids against mixed connective tissue disease. After the introduction of captopril, good pressure control was obtained in all 3 cases, although reasonable effects of measurement values of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (decrease in angiotensin I & II, increase in I/II ratio, etc.) were found only in the first case.", 
    "334": "Since the introduction of vasodilator therapy, progress has been realized in the management of advanced congestive heart failure (CHF) of different etiologies. The most encouraging influences on hemodynamics, exercise tolerance and symptomatology have been reported with ACE-inhibitors. While hemodynamic parameters do correlate with prognosis in CHF [11, 14, 27], the overall prognosis in CHF is very poor [19], and there is no tight correlation between symptomatology, hemodynamics and prognosis [13]. A powerful influence of ACE-inhibitors has been demonstrated not only on hemodynamics and on the neuro-endocrine activation in CHF [10], but also on left ventricular hypertrophy [22] and myocardial morphology [16, 23]. On the background of these therapeutic options, we designed a double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled trial on the efficacy of captopril on mortality and morbidity in chronic CHF. The basic population studied consists of patients of a large community, university-affiliated hospital, with five sub-specialized divisions in internal medicine, and about 600 medical beds. All patients considered for participation live in the greater Munich area.",

Patients were randomized if they were on stable therapy for their chronic congestive heart failure usually on digitalis and diuretics. Endpoints for the double-blind treatment period were either death or severe (with digitalis and diuretics) untractable heart failure NYHA Class IV. Follow-up examinations comprised office visits of the patients every three months for a precise cardiac history over the last three months based on a questionnaire.

    "336": "With the availability of orally active angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, it has become possible to chronically inhibit the renin-angiotensin system. When given to hypertensive patients as monotherapy, these agents can normalize the blood pressure in about 50% of all cases like other antihypertensive drugs. If the monotherapy is not sufficient to normalize blood pressure, the addition of a sodium depletion, for instance by administering concomitantly a diuretic, can become necessary to normalize blood pressure. The antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors is characterized by some particularly favorable features: ACE inhibitors attenuate the fall in serum potassium and the rise in plasma uric acid induced by diuretics, they do not cause any salt retention nor orthostatic hypotension, they do not raise pulse rate when they reduce blood pressure, and they certainly do not reduce the perfusion rate of the brain, the heart or the kidneys. The same features are apparent when using these agents in patients with congestive heart failure, in whom these drugs enhance cardiac output and exercise capacity by decreasing simultaneously pre- and afterload to the heart. Untoward effects of ACE inhibitors are relatively infrequent and they can mostly be foreseen based on an understanding of the pharmacological mechanisms of these compounds. Thus, with appropriate use, untoward effects are often completely avoided. Recent clinical studies have suggested that ACE inhibitors, when compared to other antihypertensive drugs, can improve the quality of life.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "337": "This 3-part discussion of captopril, the first oral angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, focuses on the clinical use and superiority of this agent to standard treatments and the new observations that use can improve the overall poor survival associated with heart failure. Today, as in the past, treatment of CHF includes digoxin and diuretics. Vasodilators have been relegated by some to the role of supplementing therapeutic regimens when patients remain symptomatic. Recently, controlled studies have shown that the introduction and supplementation of therapeutic regimens with ACE inhibitions and specifically captopril is associated with substantial clinical benefits: Symptoms are reduced as hemodynamics and exercise capacity improve, metabolic derangements (including fluid retention, potassium and magnesium loss and sympathetic nervous activation) are reduced with resultant favourable effects on arrhythmia frequency and finally the newest and most dramatic observation of improved survival. This review will briefly summarize these developments and assist in the clinically important aspects of this therapy for practicing physicians. Guidelines for the clinical use of captopril: In patients with confirmed dilated cardiomyopathy, captopril improves stroke volume in response to afterload reduction, but in volume-contracted patients vasodilation may be associated with hypotension. Therefore, prior to initiating captopril, the diuretic dosage should be reduced, particularly in low serum sodium concentration states if intravascular volume is depleted. Potassium supplements should be stopped due to the expected decrease of aldosterone production and improved potassium retention. Initial therapy should be started with a low captopril dosage (2 to 3 times 6.25 mg/day), maintenance dosages are 25 or 50 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d. Superiority to other vasodilator drugs and use in mild cases: In studies of acute and chronic CHF, captopril improves hemodynamics, exercise tolerance, and reduces symptoms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "338": "Since the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is identical with kininase II, the reduction of its activity by an ACE-inhibitor such as captopril will not only decrease the concentration of angiotensin II but also elevate the levels of kinins. Although the slight increase of the latter will not contribute to the antihypertensive action of ACE-inhibitors, we are sure today that it exhibits local metabolic effects in cardiac and skeletal muscle tissue. These endogenous kinins have been shown to improve the utilisation of glucose in the human forearm, the whole organism and the isolated perfused rat heart and seem to exhibit their effects via prostaglandins. A cross-over plot of the glycolytic intermediates at the height of phosphofructokinase induced by bradykinin in rat heart and the activation of the purified enzyme from rabbit heart by PGE2 point to an enhanced glycolytic rate as their mode of action. From these findings similar effects under ACE-inhibitors can be assumed. This was investigated in ten non-insulin-dependent diabetics, whose glucose disposal rate was measured by the glucose clamp technique. After 25 mg of captopril their peripheral insulin resistance was significantly improved, which was found to be due to an accelerated rate of glucose uptake into their forearm muscle tissue. To evaluate the clinical relevance of these data, 15 mildly hypertensive, overweight type II-diabetic patients (mean age: 53 years; seven women) were hospitalized. After a seven-day wash-out period, the patients were given 25 mg of captopril twice daily for seven days. During the treatment, systemic kinin concentrations significantly increased.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "339": "The effects of captopril versus placebo on oxygen consumption in the exercising leg have been examined using Doppler measurements of femoral flow and arteriovenous oxygen difference. Twenty patients with heart failure were randomized to captopril 25 mg (N = 10) or placebo (N = 10). Maximal supine exercise of one leg was performed before treatment and again 1 h and 4 h afterwards. Systemic haemodynamic variables were unaffected by placebo, but captopril increased stroke index at peak exercise from 26 +/- 3 to 34 +/- 3 ml beat-1 m-2 and reduced pulmonary artery wedge pressure from 26 +/- 3 to 16 +/- 3 mmHg (P less than 0.05). Despite the captopril-induced improvement in left ventricular function, exercise duration did not increase significantly and peak values for femoral flow (1059 +/- 178 to 938 +/- 134 ml min-1, P = NS), and oxygen consumption (134 +/- 26 to 111 +/- 18 ml min-1, P = NS) in the exercising leg were unaffected. Cutaneous flow, as reflected by skin temperature (27.5 +/- 0.4 to 27.6 +/- 0.4 degrees C, P = NS), was also unaffected. In the patients randomized to captopril, the acute improvement in left ventricular function was abbreviated and, after 4 h, all variables had returned towards baseline. Moreover, when the invasive studies were repeated after four weeks chronic treatment responsiveness to converting enzyme inhibition had attenuated and there were no detectable differences between the captopril and placebo groups. These data have demonstrated an acute captopril-induced improvement in left ventricular function in patients with congestive heart failure. Nevertheless the beneficial acute response was abbreviated predicting the development of early tolerance. Oxygen delivery to the exercising leg showed no tendency to increase either acutely when left ventricular function was significantly improved, or chronically when systemic responsiveness had attenuated. Thus irrespective of its effects on left ventricular function, captopril does not increase nutritive flow to exercising skeletal muscle in congestive heart failure.", 
    "340": "Previous studies have shown that captopril (CP) inhibits ADH-stimulated osmotic water permeability (Pf) in the toad bladder by potentiating endogenous bradykinin (BK). The present studies examine the effect of CP on ADH-stimulated Pf in isolated, perfused rabbit cortical collecting tubules (CCT). CP (10(-4) M) reversibly inhibited Pf, stimulated by maximal concentrations of ADH (10 microU/ml). Pretreatment of CCT's with 5 microM indomethacin, however, abolished the effect of CP. Inhibition of BK production by the kallikrein inhibitors, aprotinin and benzamidine, failed to enhance Pf stimulated by submaximal concentrations of ADH (2.5 microU/ml). Since ADH exerts its effects by activation of adenylyl cyclase (AC), further experiments were performed to identify the site at which CP inhibits this cascade. CP significantly inhibited forskolin (10(-4) M) stimulated Pf; however, it had no effect on cyclic AMP (10(-5) M) stimulated Pf, suggesting that the site of action is on the catalytic subunit or one of the GTP regulatory proteins of AC. To further localize the site of CP's action, CCT's were pre-incubated with pertussis toxin (0.5 microgram/ml) to inactivate the inhibitory, guanosine triphosphate (GTP) regulatory protein, Gi. In these tubules, CP failed to inhibit the action of ADH. We conclude that CP stimulates prostaglandin production which in turn activates Gi and inhibits AC activity. We further suggest that CP stimulates PG's directly, not via BK.", 
    "341": "The effect of converting enzyme inhibition (CEI) by captopril (CAP, 500 mg/liter drinking water) on the development and progression of glomerulosclerosis (GS) was studied in six groups of male uninephrectomized (UN) Wistar rats. In group A, treated with CAP for four to five weeks after UN, a reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP), filtration fraction and glomerular volumes was found as compared to control group B. Long-term treatment with CAP for eight months after UN (group C) resulted in lowering of SBP with 30 mm Hg, a low level of proteinuria and low incidence of GS (0 to 1.5%) as compared to control rats (group D), with SBP of 131 +/- 4 mm Hg, proteinuria up to 103 to 509 mg/day and 9.1 to 29.7% GS at eight months after UN. Groups E and F were followed without therapy up to seven months after UN, at which time a high level of proteinuria was present. CAP therapy then started in group E, did not reduce SBP, proteinuria and GS at 11 months after UN relative to control group F. This study shows that early CEI prevents progressive proteinuria and GS in rats after UN and is associated with a reduction in SBP, filtration fraction and glomerular volume. Once high levels of proteinuria and GS have developed in rats after UN, CEI has no effect on SBP nor on the progression of GS and proteinuria.", 
    "342": "The antihypertensive efficacy of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may result from the blockade of angiotensin II formation but also, theoretically, from the inhibition of kinin breakdown. To test whether a blunted activity of the kallikrein-kinin system might account for the failure of ACE inhibitors in lowering blood pressure (BP) in patients in whom the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is not enhanced, 31 essential hypertensives with normal or low plasma renin activity (PRA) were evaluated before and after a single oral dose (50 mg) of captopril. A significant fall, in both systolic and diastolic BP, was obtained in the subgroup of patients who were classified as 'normal-kallikrein hypertensives' according to whether their pretreatment urinary kallikrein excretion was within the normal range, while no significant change in BP was observed in 'low-kallikrein hypertensives'. Furthermore, the mean percentage fall in mean BP, throughout the 2 h following captopril administration, was significantly related to the basal value of urinary kallikrein excretion (r = 0.47, P less than 0.05) in all the patients. Our results suggest that blunted activity of the kallikrein system might be responsible for failure of captopril to lower BP in some hypertensive patients.", 
    "343": "Fifteen patients with primary Raynaud's phenomenon received captopril 25 mg or placebo, three times daily for 6 weeks, in a randomized double-blind cross-over study. Compared with placebo, captopril produced a significant improvement in cutaneous blood flow but did not alter the frequency or severity of attacks of Raynaud's phenomenon.", 
    "344": "Although hypertension is a frequent complication of cyclosporin A (CSA) therapy in clinical practice, little experimental information is available on the nature and the mechanism of this form of hypertension. We studied the effect of currently recommended therapeutic dosages of CSA, i.e., 5 (CSA5) and 20 (CSA20) mg.kg-1.day-1, on blood pressure and the renin-aldosterone system (RAS) in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Influence of in vivo CSA treatment on in vitro angiotensin II (ANG II)-stimulated aldosterone secretion by isolated adrenal glomerulosa cells (AGC) was also measured. CSA treatment in SHR resulted in a consistent increase in systolic blood pressure. This increase in blood pressure occurred in the absence of significant changes in creatinine clearance in CSA5 rats, whereas in CSA20 rats a significant reduction in creatinine clearance was observed. Sodium balance and serum calcium and magnesium concentrations were not different between the control group and either of the two CSA-treated groups of rats. Plasma renin concentration (PRC) and inactive renin (IR) were markedly elevated, but plasma renin substrate remained unchanged with CSA administration. Despite the presence of hyperreninemia, plasma aldosterone was not elevated, suggesting that CSA may induce relative adrenal resistance to ANG II. This possibility was tested using AGC isolated from CSA-treated rats. ANG II-stimulated aldosterone secretion in AGC was diminished by low dose and aborted by high dose CSA-treatment. Thus CSA administration in SHR induces a predictable increase in blood pressure in association with \"hyperreninemic hypoaldosteronism.\"", 
    "345": "We have studied the effects of captopril, nitrates and dobutamine on hemodynamics and regional blood flow in the conscious rabbit with adriamycin cardiomyopathy. Rabbits were injected twice weekly with adriamycin (1 mg.kg-1 bw.) for 8 weeks and subsequently maintained for 2 weeks without adriamycin in order to allow recovery from any noncardiac effects. Doses of drug for investigation (captopril, 300 micrograms.kg-1.min-1; isosorbide dinitrate, 10 micrograms.kg-1.min-1; and dobutamine, 10.9 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) were chosen in anticipation of a 20% increase of cardiac output in animals with heart failure. In animals with heart failure myocardial blood flow was increased by dobutamine and to a lesser extent by captopril. Renal blood flow was increased only by captopril and nitrates. Cerebral blood flow was reduced by captopril in control animals but unaltered in animals with heart failure. The observed alterations of blood flow were similar to those known to occur in humans and indicate that this is a useful model of heart failure for the evaluation of new drugs.", 
    "346": "We investigated how bradykinin mediates inflammatory reactions in rats, via measurements of bradykinin by enzyme immunoassay method in inflammatory tissue fluids. Vascular permeability was increased markedly during the first 10 min and then declined quickly after the infusion of a kaolin suspension (10 mg/ml) in 0.8% carboxymethl-cellulose solution into an air pouch formed on the back of rats. Bradykinin in the exudate reached a maximum 5 min after the challenge and then decreased quickly. Local treatment with DL-2-mercaptomethyl-3-guanidinoethylthiopropanoic acid, an inhibitor of kininase I, and captopril, an inhibitor of kininase II in the first 10-min period, each enhanced the vascular permeability increase accompanied by the elevation of the bradykinin level, whereas soybean trypsin inhibitor, a plasma kallikrein inhibitor, lowered both vascular permeability and bradykinin. When applied in the period of 3.5 to 4 hr after the challenge, only the kininase II inhibitor was effective in elevating both vascular permeability and the bradykinin level, whereas soybean trypsin inhibitor was ineffective on vascular permeability. A bradykinin-degrading activity appeared in the exudate as early as 10 min after the challenge. These results suggest that bradykinin plays an essential role for the sudden rise of the vascular permeability observed immediately after the infusion of kaolin suspension. In the later stage (3.5-4 hr), bradykinin level remained below the assay limit of 0.07 ng/ml in spite of its active generation, presumably because of its rapid degradation by the kininases, although it still played a definite role in the vascular permeability increase.", 
    "347": "Angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitors are typically classified as peripheral vasodilators. We studied the effect of captopril and a known vasodilator, hydralazine, on arterial pressure-urinary output relationships in adult spontaneously hypertensive rats to determine whether these drugs produced similar changes in this relationship. Tail-cuff pressure and 24-hour urine output and sodium excretion were measured under steady state conditions during ingestion of tap water or saline (1% NaCl) ad libitum. Sodium intake increased seven to nine times when rats drank saline, but in the absence of drug treatment, tail-cuff pressure was not altered significantly (water, 213 +/- 3 vs saline, 220 +/- 5 mm Hg). Daily administration of captopril (100 mg/kg p.o.) or hydralazine (15 mg/kg p.o.) for 2 weeks lowered tail-cuff pressure significantly (175 +/- 3 and 166 +/- 3 mm Hg, respectively; p less than 0.01) while rats drank tap water. Continued administration of hydralazine plus 2 weeks of drinking saline did not alter tail-cuff pressure (162 +/- 4 mm Hg), but with the addition of saline during captopril treatment, tail-cuff pressure was elevated significantly (210 +/- 5 mm Hg; p less than 0.01). Thus, hydralazine produced a parallel shift of the arterial pressure-urinary output relationship along the pressure axis. In contrast, captopril produced a marked change in the slope of this relationship, making arterial pressure extremely salt-sensitive. The results suggest that the two drugs have different effects on the mechanisms that contribute to the long-term control of arterial pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "348": "Studies of the baroreceptor-heart rate reflex were performed in four conscious, unrestrained male baboons to determine whether changes in circulating angiotensin II within the physiological range are associated with alterations in baroreceptor reflex sensitivity. With the animals on a high sodium intake, studies were performed before and during graded angiotensin II infusion (10 and 20 ng/kg/min). To separate effects on baroreceptor reflex function mediated by angiotensin II-induced increases in arterial pressure, these studies were repeated on a different day with simultaneous glyceryl trinitrate infusion to prevent increases in pressure during angiotensin II infusion. With the animals on a low sodium intake, studies were performed before and after angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition with captopril (1 and 5 mg/kg). These studies were also repeated on a separate day during simultaneous phenylephrine infusion to prevent a decrease in pressure with captopril. Reduction in sodium intake had no significant effect on arterial pressure, heart rate, or plasma volume, although arterial plasma angiotensin II concentration and renin activity were significantly increased (p less than 0.01). Infusion of angiotensin II produced a significant reduction in baroreceptor reflex sensitivity (p less than 0.01), and converting enzyme inhibition produced a significant increase (p less than 0.05). These effects accompanied significant increases and decreases in arterial angiotensin II concentration, respectively (p less than 0.01), but were independent of angiotensin II-related changes in arterial pressure. The data indicate that physiological variations in circulating angiotensin II have a direct effect on sensitivity of the baroreceptor-heart rate reflex.", 
    "349": "Left ventricular hypertrophy can be reversed by treatment of hypertension with captopril but the consequences of this regression are not yet fully described. We studied the maximal capacity of the hypertrophied and hypertrophy-reversed ventricle to generate pressure during transient total occlusion of the aorta, and also the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure required to meet this maximal effort. Two-kidney, one clip Goldblatt (renal hypertensive rats; RHR) hypertension was induced in 17 Wistar rats, eight of which were treated with captopril (RHR-C: 50 mg/kg given orally) from the fourth to the eighth week. Sham-operated controls (SC) remained untreated, or were treated with similar doses of captopril (SC-C). Significantly lower heart weights were found in RHR-C than in RHR (2.88 +/- 0.15 versus 2.38 +/- 0.04; P less than 0.001). During transient total occlusion of the aorta, the maximal intraventricular pressure developed in RHR-C was not significantly different from that in RHR, but left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was significantly less in RHR-C than in RHR (21.4 +/- 2.2 versus 34.3 +/- 3.8; P less than 0.01). The analysis of pressure-volume characteristics of the hypertrophied left ventricles and those in which hypertrophy was reversed revealed similar compliances between these two groups. Our data suggest that there was a mechanical improvement in the heart function after reversal of left ventricular hypertrophy.", 
    "350": "The effects of acute administration of corticosterone acetate (7.5 mg/kg bolus; 5 mg.kg-1h-1 infusion) on plasma corticosterone levels and blood pressure (BP) responses to hypotension induced by ganglion blockade (with pentolinium) were studied in conscious Long Evans and Brattleboro (vasopressin-deficient) rats. Steroid infusion raised plasma corticosterone levels similarly in both strains of rat, but there was no effect on resting BP. However, the fall in BP after pentolinium administration was less in the steroid-treated groups of both strains than in their vehicle-injected counterparts. During infusion of pentolinium the ensuing recovery in BP was abolished by captopril administration. Steroid treatment did not affect this recovery but did attenuate the hypotensive effects of captopril. In Long Evans rats, only, there was a further vasopressin-mediated, recovery in BP during the infusion of pentolinium and captopril. This recovery was not accentuated by the presence of the steroid. In a further experiment, infusion of corticosterone acetate after the onset of hypotension (induced by pentolinium, captopril and d(CH2)5DAVP in Long Evans rats or by pentolinium and captopril in Brattleboro rats) caused a progressive increase in BP in both strains. These findings demonstrate a pressor action of corticosterone acetate which is apparent after hypotension induced by ganglionic blockade and which does not necessarily involve any interaction with the renin-angiotensin system or vasopressin."
