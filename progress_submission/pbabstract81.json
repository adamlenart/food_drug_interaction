    "1": "In nine normotensive patients with angiographically assessed coronary atherosclerosis, we measured the changes in mean arterial pressure (intra-arterial catheter), heart rate, rate-pressure product (RPP), coronary sinus blood flow (CBF, thermodilution method), and coronary vascular resistance (CVR, ratio between mean arterial pressure and CBF) induced by the cold pressor test (CPT, 2 minutes) and diving (30 seconds), i.e., two stimuli eliciting a sympathetic coronary vasoconstriction. The measurements were performed in the control condition and 30 minutes after captopril 25 mg p.o. In the control condition, CPT caused an increase in mean arterial pressure and heart rate. Despite the increase in RPP (+20.7 +/- 3.2%, p less than 0.01), CBF did not change and CVR increased (+12.2 +/- 4.0%, p less than 0.05). diving caused an increase in mean arterial pressure and a reduction in heart rate. RPP increased (+14.3 +/- 3.5%, p less than 0.01), but despite this increase, there was a reduction in CBF and a marked increase in CVR (+37.3 +/- 7.4%, p less than 0.01). Captopril did not modify the blood pressure and heart rate responses to both stimuli except for a slight accentuation of the bradycardia to diving. Despite the unchanged or only slightly reduced RPP response, the increase in CVR was markedly and significantly attenuated (p less than 0.01).", 
    "2": "ACE inhibition attenuates sympathetic coronary vasoconstriction in patients with coronary artery disease. This is probably due to removal of the facilitating influence of angiotensin II on sympathetic modulation of coronary vasomotor tone.", 
    "3": "The quantitative impact of mesenteric vasoconstriction on the systemic hemodynamic response to cardiogenic shock induced by pericardial tamponade was evaluated. Graded increases in pericardial pressure produced corresponding decreases in cardiac output to 44% +/- 2% and arterial pressure to 64% +/- 3% of baseline and increases in total peripheral vascular resistance to 131% +/- 4% of baseline. Total mesenteric blood flow decreased disproportionately, to 28% +/- 3% of baseline, because of a disproportionate increase in mesenteric vascular resistance to 223% +/- 6% of baseline. Nonmesenteric vascular resistance increased only to 119% +/- 4% of baseline. Thus mesenteric vasoconstriction accounted for 42% of the increase in total peripheral resistance. Prior blockade of the renin-angiotensin axis ablated this response and eliminated the mesenteric contribution to systemic vascular resistance, while confirmed blockade of the alpha-adrenergic system or vasopressin system had no effect. Without shock, central intravenous infusions of angiotensin II (but not norepinephrine or vasopressin) closely mimicked this selective vasoconstriction. Angiotensin-mediated selective mesenteric vasoconstriction accounts for more than 40% of the overall increase in systemic vascular resistance in cardiogenic shock.", 
    "4": "A captopril renal study performed with both radiohippuran and 99mTc-MAG3 demonstrated the typical changes of a hemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis in a hypertensive renal allograft recipient. Arteriography demonstrated high grade stenosis not of the renal artery but of the iliac artery. After successful angioplasty, the patient's hypertension resolved.", 
    "5": "The primary goal of the current study was to assess in situ, using magnetic resonance imaging, the effect of a new angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, cilazapril, in reducing left ventricular remodeling after acute myocardial infarction. Three groups of animals were investigated: (1) sham-operated rats (n = 19); (2) infarcted rats receiving no treatment (n = 23); and (3) infarcted rats receiving cilazapril (100 mg/L drinking water, n = 20). Treatment with cilazapril began on the third day postocclusion and continued for 3 to 4 months. Myocardial infarction was produced by ligation of the left coronary artery, and electrocardiographic (ECG)-gated short-axis images were acquired 3 to 4 months later. Sham-operated animals were subjected to the same procedure but the left coronary artery was not ligated. From the image acquired in the middle of the left ventricle (equatorial slice), left ventricular wall thicknesses, chamber diameters, and surface area measurements of the cavities were determined. At autopsy examination, infarct size and tissue water content were determined. The results demonstrate that magnetic resonance imaging has the potential to assess in situ the alterations of left ventricular dimensions and mass after acute myocardial infarction and can be used to document the influence of therapeutic interventions. Cilazapril provided protection against the deleterious remodeling changes such as ventricular dilation and wall thinning consequent to acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "6": "The goal of the current study was to determine whether treatment of hypertension reduces cerebral infarction after occlusion of the middle cerebral artery in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSPs). Three-month-old SHRSPs received untreated drinking water or drinking water containing cilazapril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, or hydralazine and hydrochlorothiazide. After 3 months of treatment, the left middle cerebral artery was occluded and neurological deficit was evaluated. Infarct volume was measured 3 days after occlusion using computer imaging techniques from brain slices. Cilazapril and hydralazine with hydrochlorothiazide were equally effective in reducing systolic blood pressure in SHRSPs. One day after occlusion of the middle cerebral artery, neurological deficit was decreased by both cilazapril and hydralazine with hydrochlorothiazide compared with untreated SHRSPs, and the deficit 3 days after occlusion was decreased significantly only by cilazapril. Infarct volume was 178 +/- 7 mm3 (mean +/- SEM) in untreated SHRSPs, and it was significantly reduced to 117 +/- 15 mm3 by hydralazine with hydrochlorothiazide and to 101 +/- 17 mm3 by cilazapril. Infarct volume in Wistar-Kyoto rats was 27 +/- 16 mm3. Thus, reduction in arterial pressure by hydralazine with hydrochlorothiazide or an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor is protective against focal cerebral ischemia in SHRSPs.", 
    "7": "Angiotensin II (Ang II) has been shown to induce proliferation of cardiac myocytes. To examine the role of Ang II in left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, isoproterenol was infused subcutaneously into 9-week-old male Wistar rats at 4.2 mg/kg/day for 7 days. Infusion of isoproterenol increased LV weight and Ang II concentrations in plasma and in LV tissue. In anephric rats, LV weight and tissue Ang II were increased similarly, but plasma Ang II was not changed by isoproterenol. Concomitant oral administration of trandolapril and isoproterenol prevented increases in both LV Ang II and LV weight. Treatment with hydralazine decreased blood pressure in a similar way as trandolapril but did not affect either LV weight or LV Ang II. Plasma Ang II was not decreased by either trandolapril or hydralazine when administered in combination with isoproterenol. These results suggest that cardiac tissue Ang II regulates myocyte growth in isoproterenol-induced LV hypertrophy, and the reduction of Ang II partly explains the prevention of cardiac hypertrophy by the converting enzyme inhibitor.", 
    "8": "A multicenter, randomized double-blind study of 6 months' duration was performed in 540 patients (average age 54 years, 57% male) with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension to determine the relative effects on quality of life of cilazapril, atenolol, and nifedipine retard. Quality of life was assessed by using both a self-administered and an interviewer-administered questionnaire; the assessment included a complaint score (symptoms checklist), Health Status Index, assessment of work satisfaction, Psychological General Well-being Index, Profile of Mood States subscales, and life satisfaction assessment. Psychomotor function was measured by the Reitan Trail Making test B. At the end of the trial, diastolic blood pressure had fallen by an average of 15 mm Hg in all three groups, but significantly (p = 0.01) more patients taking cilazapril required the addition of a diuretic (36%) compared with those taking atenolol (25%) or nifedipine retard (24%). No significant differences in quality of life were observed between cilazapril and atenolol during the trial. Symptomatic complaints increased on nifedipine retard (p = 0.02) and contributed to a higher discontinuation rate (21% discontinued treatment compared with 13% and 14% taking atenolol and cilazapril, respectively, p = 0.04). However, a possible improvement in the fatigue subscale (p = 0.04) was also observed on nifedipine retard. The 95% confidence intervals showed that none of the drugs in this trial produced an effect equivalent to that previously reported between captopril and methyldopa in the Psychological General Well Being Index or between captopril and methyldopa or propranolol in Trail Making test B.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "9": "Using digitized M-mode echocardiography, the left ventricular (LV) response to acute increase in blood pressure after regression of myocardial hypertrophy due to an effective antihypertensive treatment was evaluated. Fifteen hypertensive patients with basal LV hypertrophy (LV mass greater than 230 g, and normal LV diastolic diameter) and normal LV mass after 3 to 4 months of treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were selected for study. Subjects performed a cold pressor test before and after therapy. LV systolic function was normal in all subjects. LV diastolic function (impaired at basal evaluation in 13 subjects) improved after therapy in all subjects, with normalization in 10. Before treatment, the cold pressor test induced significant increases in blood pressure and heart rate without changes in LV parameters. After regression of hypertrophy, the cold pressor test induced increases in hemodynamic parameters comparable to those of the basal test, and LV parameters remained unchanged. Our results indicate that regression of myocardial hypertrophy induced by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors does not impair the ability of the left ventricle to face acute increases in afterload. The improvement in LV diastolic function (found at rest after reversal of hypertrophy) persists during the cold pressor test, which confirms that it is primarily due to LV mass reduction and is not simply a consequence of decrease in afterload induced by treatment.", 
    "10": "The admission of antihypertensive medications in the elderly (65 y.o. or more, 269 pts) was compared to that in younger cases (less than 65 y.o., 348 pts). All were outpatients who visited our clinic in 1990. The number of patients on a single therapeutic regimen was almost equal in both age groups. Once-a-day regimens were more common in the young (56.9% vs 48.3%, p less than 0.05), and three times-a-day regimens were more common in the elderly (14.7% vs 23.1%, p less than 0.01). The choice of antihypertensive drugs in patients with single therapy or combined therapy in the young was beta blockers in 49.7%, Ca blockers in 39.4%, diuretics in 30.7% and ACE inhibitors in 17.8%, and those in the elderly were Ca blockers in 46.1%, diuretics in 44.2%, beta blockers in 33.8%, and ACE inhibitors in 16.4%. The patients were subdivided into three groups according to the time of the initial visit to the clinic; initial visit during 1969-1979 (phase 1), 1980-1984 (phase 2) and 1985-1990 (phase 3). In the young, choice of beta blockers and diuretics was most popular in phase 1. However, the choice of diuretics decreased in phase 2, and in phase 3 beta blockers were used in 50.4%, Ca blockers in 43.2%, ACE inhibitors in 22.3% and diuretics in only 17.3%. In the elderly, diuretics were most popular followed by Ca blockers and beta blockers in phase 1 and phase 2. In phase 3 Ca blockers were selected in 58.2% followed by both beta blockers and ACE inhibitors in 28.4% then diuretics in 23.9%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "11": "The aim of this study was to assess whether an interaction exists between the renin-angiotensin system and the sympathetic nervous system at the level of the adrenal medulla during insulin-induced hypoglycemia in normal humans. Seventeen healthy volunteers were studied in a randomized, single-dose, double-blind, cross-over fashion using 25 mg captopril v placebo followed by an intravenous injection of 0.15 IU/kg insulin. Blood samples were obtained before and at 15 min intervals after insulin injection. Both plasma glucose level and heart rate were identical during captopril and placebo at rest and after insulin. Plasma renin activity increased after insulin and captopril. The increase in plasma epinephrine was lower after insulin and captopril compared to after insulin and placebo. Likewise the increase in plasma norepinephrine was blunted on insulin and captopril. Thus, when the generation of angiotensin II was blocked by captopril the insulin-induced rise in epinephrine and norepinephrine was blunted. This indicates that an interaction exists between the renin-angiotensin system and the sympathoadrenal system.", 
    "12": "In a retrospective study we analyse two populations of aged patients in congestive heart failure, one treated with ACE inhibitors other not and the other with conventional therapy. Both populations received the same medication (diuretics and digitalis) and are equivalent in age, sex distribution, NYHA functional class and echocardiographic left ventricular parameters. Comparing the mortality of the two populations at the first, second and third year of follow-up, a statistically significant reduction in mortality was found on the ACE inhibitors treated population, at the first year. However, this reduction did not reach statistical significance at second and third years. The results are similar to trials in which the effects of ACE inhibitors are studied on general populations in heart failure.", 
    "13": "Blood pressure (BP) was recorded directly and automatically by a microcomputer aid system for 48 h in normotensive and Goldblatt hypertensive goats. By population-mean cosinor fitting, significant circadian rhythms were found for SBP and DBP in both groups of goats. The BP during nighttime was higher than that during daytime in our goats. An angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, was given to hypertensive goats with usual schedule of drug administration (25mg, t.i.d) or form of chronotherapy (62.5 mg, given before the acrophase of BP, q.n). BP significantly decreased throughout the whole day in both treated groups. But there was no statistical difference of cosinor parameters between the effects of BP in these two groups. BP could be decreased by the method of chronotherapy with less amount of drug and less frequency of drug administration.", 
    "14": "Bulbar conjunctival microcirculation, aggregation of platelets and red blood cells, skin oxygen balance were studied in 22 patients with Stage II hypertensive disease. Captopril was found to decrease not only blood pressure, but aggregation of platelets and red blood cells and to improve tissue oxygen supply. With inadequate doses of the drug, an extreme lowering in blood pressure resulted in deteriorated skin oxygen supply along with unaltered aggregation of cellular elements.", 
    "15": "The antihypertensive efficacy of combination therapy with N-E-A was evaluated during 6 months in 15 patients with hypertension associated with mild to moderate kidney failure. After 6 months a significant reduction of SBP and DBP (p < 0.001), with improvement of creatinine clearance and with no adverse effects on ECG, heart rate and routine laboratory tests test, was observed in 3 patients treated with N 20 mg x 2/d + E 10 mg/d + A 50 mg/d and in 8 patients treated with N 20 mg x 3 + E 10 mg x 2, + A 50 mg x 2.

There were analyzed heart rate (HR), arterial systolic (Ps) and diastolic (Pd) blood pressure, body weight (Mc), 24-hour urinary output (Dd), cardio-thoracic index (CTI), cardiac volume index (CVI) and dimensions of the left ventricle: systolic (LVIDs), and diastolic (LVIDd). The mean daily doses of the drugs were as follows: D-0.290 +/- 0.108 mg, F-13.0 +/- 4.1 mg, S-44.5 +/- 9.8 mg, N-42.0 +/- 12.2 mg, and C-75.1 +/- 24.4 mg. The treatment with vasodilators (Vd) induced decreases in Mc, CVI, LVIIDs and LVIDd in comparison with the treatment with D and F. The largest lowerings in HR, Ps, Pd and Mc were observed during the treatment with D and F. The most beneficial effects with regard to CVI, LVIDs and LVIDd were obtained during four-week treatment with captopril.", 
    "17": "Nephropathy is a severe complication of type I diabetes mellitus. About 25% of all new candidates for renal replacement therapy consist of diabetic patients. Glomerular hyperfiltration is an important causative factor in the development of this nephropathy. Microalbuminuria is the clinical first symptom of glomerular hypertension. New information stresses the importance of angiotensin II. Systemic as well as local reduction of angiotensin II formation can reduce glomerular hyperfiltration. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors should therefore be considered as first anti-hypertensive agents in type I diabetics with microalbuminuria.", 
    "18": "The hypotensive efficacy of (S)-1-[6-amino-2[[hydroxy(4-phenylbutyl) phosphinyl]oxy]-1-oxohexyl]-L-proline (SQ 29,852), a phosphorus-containing novel angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) was examined in conscious two-kidney, one-clip Goldblatt hypertensive dogs. The acute hypotensive effect of SQ 29 852 was compared with that of captopril or enalapril at 3 mg/kg, p.o., for each, and the potencies were ranked as follows, enalapril greater than SQ 29,852 greater than captopril. On the other hand, the hypotension caused by repetitive dosing with SQ 29,852 (3 mg/kg, p.o./d for 7 d followed by another 7-d treatment with 10 mg/kg, p.o./d) was somewhat more marked than that by enalapril at the same dosage. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) increased in all the animals given enalapril, while that in all of the SQ 29,852-treated animals did not increase. These results indicate that SQ 29,852 is a potent, and long-lasting ACEI with a possible low incidence of side effects.", 
    "19": "Ceronapril is a member of a new chemical class of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors being developed by The Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute. A radioimmunoassay (RIA) has been developed for the measurement of ceronapril in biological fluids. The RIA has a range of 0 to 500 ng/ml and has the sensitivity to detect 1.0 ng/ml of ceronapril. Satisfactory zero binding and sensitivity were obtained after a 2-h incubation at room temperature or overnight at 4 degrees C. Separation of the antibody-bound and free radiolabel was achieved by employing polyethylene glycol-goat anti-rabbit gamma-globulin separant. A quantitative recovery of the exogenous analyte was obtained at all concentrations of ceronapril tested. Intraassay coefficients of variance (CV's) were 3.9% and 4.6% for the low and medium controls, respectively. A highly significant statistical correlation between RIA and [14C]TLRC was observed for both plasma and urine samples. Clinical samples from the ascending dosage studies have been analyzed by the ceronapril RIA. The maximum concentration and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve did not increase in a dose-proportional manner for doses above 100 mg.", 
    "20": "Using the nuclear medicine procedures it is possible to evaluate the renovascular hypertension via the captopril test. Decreased renal blood flow due to stenotic vessel may produce a variety of findings on the renogram using both OIH-I131 and DTPA-Tc99m. Delayed transit time and excretion also may be detected. In this situation the sensitivity and specificity of Nuclear Medicine for RAS detection is very low. Using Captopril test is possible to detect enhanced modification on the shape of renogram due to Angiotensin Converting enzyme inhibition.", 
    "21": "Captopril, an inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme is widely used in the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure. It contains active sulfhydryl group and shares other structural feature with cysteine, the main substrate of glutathione. Experiments were undertaken to examine the effect of captopril on concentration of endogenous glutathione in the liver and to examine the ability of captopril to protect against paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity. Single doses of captopril (30 mg/kg) given to male Sprague-Dawley rats produced a significant time dependent depletion of hepatic glutathione: at 3 h--16% (controls--10% as the effect of fasting; p less than 0.02), at 5 h--25% (controls--17%; p less than 0.02). Pretreatment of rats with single doses of captopril (30 mg/kg) 2 hours prior to administration of toxic doses of paracetamol (2500 mg/kg) produced a significant depletion of hepatic glutathione level as compared with animals without pretreatment with captopril (median: 2.95 mumol/g liver and 3.50 mumol/g liver, respectively; p less than 0.01). This was not accompanied by a difference in the hepatotoxic effect of paracetamol as assessed by histological staging of necrosis. Studies on covalent binding of paracetamol showed that neither captopril at the doses 30 mg/kg, nor penicillamine (20 mg/kg) affected covalent binding of paracetamol metabolites to cell protein. The results suggest that captopril despite its structural similarity to cysteine depletes hepatic glutathione level and does not protect against paracetamol hepatotoxicity.", 
    "22": "The effects of bicarbonate on acid production by 4 human strains of Actinomyces viscosus were estimated under anaerobic conditions. The rate of acid production was accelerated by bicarbonate 3-4 times as much as that without bicarbonate. The analyses of intracellular glycolytic intermediates, NAD and NADH revealed a decrease in NADH:NAD ratio and an increase in the level of 3-phosphoglycerate in the cells when bicarbonate was present. Furthermore, when bicarbonate was available, malate dehydrogenase and fumarate reductase in the succinate pathway were expected to function as NADH-oxidizing enzymes in addition to lactate dehydrogenase. These observations indicate the efficient regeneration of NAD in the presence of bicarbonate. Thus, the stimulation of A. viscosus glycolysis by bicarbonate was thought to stem from the activation of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) by the decrease in the level of NADH, because NADH was a strong inhibitor of G3PDH in this microorganism.", 
    "23": "Drug-induced pemphigus has been recognized for 20 years, but the mechanisms leading to acantholysis are still unclear. It has recently been demonstrated that penicillamine, captopril, and thiopronin may produce acantholytic lesions, either by direct toxic or biochemical effect, in human skin explants. Our work confirms that penicillamine and captopril may induce acantholysis on the model of keratinocyte culture on dead, de-epidermized dermis. Moreover, it demonstrates that piroxicam, a new non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, of which one side effect is a pemphigus vulgaris-like eruption, is also able to produce in vitro acantholysis.", 
    "24": "Platelet angiotensin II concentrations were significantly (P less than 0.01) elevated in 16 patients with a history of cerebral infarction, compared with 12 control subjects. The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, captopril, enalapril and delapril hydrochloride, were evaluated in 20 hypertensive patients with a history of cerebral infarction. Each agent was administered orally each day for 12 weeks using an open randomized crossover design. After 4 weeks' treatment, 75 mg/kg captopril significantly (P less than 0.01) increased platelet angiotensin II concentrations and the increase was maintained for a further 8 weeks. Treatment with 5 mg/day enalapril resulted in no significant change in angiotensin II. Treatment with 30 mg/day delapril hydrochloride significantly (P less than 0.05) decreased platelet angiotensin II concentrations at 4 weeks and the change persisted for 12 weeks (P less than 0.01). During delapril hydrochloride treatment platelet angiotensin II concentrations approached normal values. It is concluded that delapril hydrochloride may be used to treat patients with arteriosclerosis disorders and may inhibit the tendency for atherosclerotic changes and thrombosis.", 
    "25": "All possible diastereoisomers of the dicarboxylic acid (10a), the biologically active form of imidapril (1), were synthesized, and their inhibitory activity against angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) was examined. The in vitro ACE inhibitory activity of these compounds greatly depended on the configurations of the three asymmetric carbons in each molecule. The (S,S,S) isomer (10a) showed much more potent activity than the others.", 
    "26": "In elderly hypertensive patients effect of antihypertensive treatment with Ca antagonist or ACE inhibitor on the heart were examined. Twenty-four elderly hypertensive patients with cardiac hypertrophy, aged 65-79 years old (mean +/- SEM, 71 +/- 1) were treated with Ca antagonist (nifedipine or nicardipine) or ACE inhibitor (captopril or enalapril) for 3 months. Thirteen patients had essential hypertension (EH: SBP greater than or equal to 160 mmHg and DBP greater than or equal to 95 mmHg, 70 +/- 1 years) and 11 had isolated systolic hypertension (ISH: SBP greater than or equal to 160 mmHg and DBP less than 95 mmHg, 74 +/- 2 years). Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate were measured every two weeks. In all patients, M-mode echocardiography was performed to measure left ventricular mass index (LVMI) and ejection fraction (EF), and the sympathetic nervous (plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine) and the renin-angiotensin system (plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentration), were assessed before and after 3 months of treatment. BP significantly decreased from 174 +/- 3/97 +/- 1 to 149 +/- 4/84 +/- 2 mmHg in EH and from 167 +/- 3/82 +/- 2 to 144 +/- 4/74 +/- 2 mmHg in ISH. LVMI was significantly reduced from 204 +/- 14 to 174 +/- 16 g/m2 in EH and from 179 +/- 14 to 156 +/- 12 g/m2 in ISH. EF showed no significant changes in either group. In ISH, the change in LVMI was significantly correlated with the change in systolic BP (r = 0.74, p less than 0.05). In EH, there was no significant relation between BP and LVMI changes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "30": "Radioimmunoassays for a nonsulfhydryl angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor prodrug--spirapril--and its active metabolite--spiraprilate--are described. Nonextraction equilibrium assays using antibodies with a high specificity for spirapril or spiraprilate were used, with charcoal separation of bound and free tracer. Within-assay reproducibility (CV%) was less than 20% in the concentration range 0.5-40 micrograms/L for both analytes and the comparable value for between-assay reproducibility was less than 25%. Results for external quality control samples were in good agreement with the expected values of 0-250 micrograms/L (spirapril, r = 0.997) and 0-300 micrograms/L (spiraprilate, r = 0.999). Overall, samples circulated to four laboratories gave good agreement for measured values, including one center using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis for the two compounds. Data are presented to show the suitability of these two assays to the measurement of spirapril and spiraprilate in clinical samples from assays to the measurement of spirapril and spiraprilate in clinical samples from dose-ranging and bioequivalence studies. Results are also shown relating drug plasma concentration data to a measurement of the pharmacodynamic effects of spiraprilate, namely inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme activity. It is concluded that these assays have the sensitivity for use in studies to model the relationship between the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the two compounds.", 
    "31": "We report here the protective effect of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors captopril and ramiprilat against damage due to oxygen free radicals on aortic endothelium in a superfusion cascade system. Oxygen free radicals were generated by electrolysis of Krebs solution. Acetylcholine was infused through the donor aortic segment and relaxation of the detector aortic ring was used to indicate the release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF). The percentage of relaxation before and after electrolysis was compared to calculate the relaxation index. Electrolyzed Krebs solution impaired the release of EDRF, as shown by a reduction in the relaxation index with a concomitant decrease in the tissue levels of superoxide dismutase and 6-keto PGF1 alpha and increase in malondialdehyde in the donor vessel. Captopril (100 microM), 15 microM ramiprilat and 30 nM iloprost had a protective effect as shown by a significantly smaller reduction in the relaxation index and the level of 6-keto PGF1 alpha and by an attenuation of the production of malondialdehyde. In addition, 1 microM indomethacin almost eliminated the protection by captopril. We conclude that both the SH-containing angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril and the non-SH-containing ramiprilat, as well as iloprost, a stable analog of prostacyclin, can protect rabbit aortic endothelium against damage due to oxygen free radicals. The mechanism of such protection may be partly associated with the facilitation of the release of prostacyclin and consequent reduction in lipid peroxidation.", 
    "32": "Effects of the renin-angiotension system (RAS) on adrenal catecholamine release in response to hemorrhagic hypotension and splanchnic nerve stimulation (SNS) were studied in pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs. In hemorrhage experiments, mean blood pressure (MBP) was maintained at 50 mm Hg for 60 min by bleeding the arterial blood into a pressurized bottle. In the renal intact group (control), epinephrine (EPI) and norepinephrine (NE) output from the adrenal gland increased markedly during hemorrhagic hypotension: from 45 +/- 13 and 4.7 +/- 0.9 to 1,167 +/- 202 and 169 +/- 30 ng/min at 60 min after onset of hemorrhage, respectively. The increases in catecholamine output during hemorrhagic hypotension in the renal-intact group pretreated with captopril (1 mg/kg intravenously, i.v.) and in the renal-ligated group were significantly smaller than those in the control group. The increases in catecholamine output in the renal-ligated group infused with angiotensin II (AngII 10 ng/kg/min i.v.) were comparable to those in the control group. In SNS experiments, AngII infusion (10 ng/kg/min i.v.) enhanced increases in catecholamine output induced by 3 Hz SNS significantly. Captopril (1 mg/kg i.v.) did not affect the SNS-induced increases in catecholamine output. These results suggest that the renal RAS facilitates reflex release of adrenal catecholamines during hemorrhagic hypotension, at least in part, by acting directly on the release process of catecholamines from dog adrenal gland.", 
    "33": "The antihypertensive effect of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor lisinopril administered in a single dose of 20 mg was evaluated by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. Twenty-four patients (21 men and 3 women, mean age 52 +/- 6 years) with mild to moderate hypertension were included in the study and randomly assigned to two consecutive treatments with lisinopril 20 mg and placebo, each administered for 4 weeks. On the last day of each treatment, BP was assessed by noninvasive 24-h ABPM. BP was significantly lower after lisinopril than after placebo in a 24-h period (mean 24-h systolic BP (SBP) with lisinopril 120 +/- 7 mm Hg and with placebo 135 +/- 9 mm Hg; mean day SBP with lisinopril 125 +/- 3 mm Hg and with placebo 142 +/- 5 mm Hg; mean night SBP with lisinopril 112 +/- 4 mm Hg and with placebo 124 +/- 6 mm Hg; mean 24-h diastolic BP (DBP) with lisinopril 76 +/- 6 mm Hg, and with placebo 87 +/- 8 mm Hg; mean day DBP with lisinopril 80 +/- 3 mm Hg and with placebo 93 +/- 4 mm Hg; mean night DBP with lisinopril 69 +/- 2 mm Hg and with placebo 79 +/- 5 mm Hg, p less than 0.001). Mean 24-h, mean day, and mean night heart rate (HR) did not differ significantly between placebo and lisinopril treatments. Repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed a significant influence on SBP (p less than 0.001) and DBP (p less than 0.001) throughout the treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "34": "Using a spectral procedure, we studied the acute and chronic effects of enalapril and hydralazine on the variability of blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) in conscious Wistar rats. In the acute protocol, rats received two injections 25 min apart (saline followed by enalaprilic acid or hydralazine hydrochloride). In the chronic protocol, animals received oral enalapril maleate, hydralazine hydrochloride, or distilled water. A 5-min recording session was initiated on day 12. Acute enalapril and hydralazine amplified the low-frequency (LF) component of the systolic BP (SBP) spectrum. Chronic enalapril reduced the variability of BP, as indicated by the lower variance in SBP distribution. Chronic enalapril preferentially reduced the amplitude of the 400-mHz oscillations of SBP. Acute administration of enalapril or hydralazine resulted in BP variability profiles, suggesting a reflexly mediated vascular sympathetic activation. In contrast, chronic angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) blockade with enalapril caused a significant decrease in the LF oscillations of BP. This could reflect a reduced sympathetic outflow to vascular smooth muscles.", 
    "35": "An increase in cell size and protein content was observed when quiescent arterial smooth muscle cells in culture were incubated with either angiotensin II or III. These effects were inhibited by the specific angiotensin type-1 receptor antagonist losartan (DuP753) but not by CGP42112A. In parallel, a transient and dose-dependent induction of c-fos was demonstrated not only with angiotensins II and III but also with angiotensin I. Both angiotensins II and III exerted their maximal effect at 1 microM, while angiotensin I needed a tenfold-higher concentration to exert an identical effect. As for hypertrophy, losartan also inhibits angiotensin-induced c-fos expression, suggesting that this gene may be involved into the hypertrophic process. Angiotensin-I-mediated c-fos induction is partially inhibited by the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors captopril and trandolaprilate; given that an angiotensin-converting enzyme activity was detected in these smooth muscle cell cultures, these results suggest that angiotensin-I-induced c-fos expression is mediated in part via angiotensin-I conversion to angiotensin II, but also by other unidentified pathway(s). Angiotensin I could essentially induce smooth muscle cell hypertrophy by indirect mechanisms, while angiotensins II and III act directly on smooth muscle cells.", 
    "36": "Little attention has been paid to the influence of orally administered antihypertensive drugs on intraocular pressure (IOP). Therefore, we evaluated the effects of oral medications on the IOPs and visual fields of 70 patients with systemic hypertension who had no ocular symptoms and had not visited any eye hospital. In patients with systemic hypertension treated with medication, the IOP value (mean, 18.3 +/- 4.2 mmHg; age range, 63.3 +/- 11.6 years) was significantly higher than in a control group with a similar age range who were not receiving oral medication (mean, 13.7 +/- 2.0 mmHg; age range, 62.5 +/- 7.8 years). In the group in which hypertension was controlled by medication, the IOPs were lower when orally administered beta-adrenergic blockers were given than in those patients with uncontrolled hypertension. In the group to whom calcium-channel blockers were administered orally, the IOPs were not lower. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors made the visual fields worse. This study suggests a modulating influence of orally administered drugs on the IOP and visual fields, which may be affected by whether or not the patient's blood pressure is controlled.", 
    "37": "1. The effects of beta-adrenoceptor blockade on the changes in plasma renin activity (PRA) following angiotensin enzyme (ACE) inhibition were investigated in pentobarbitone-chloralose anaesthetized dogs. 2. ACE-inhibition, with enalapril (2 mg kg-1), caused a significant reduction in systemic arterial blood pressure (BP) with little or no effect on cardiac function, and a significant elevation of plasma renin activity (PRA). By contrast beta-adrenoceptor blockade with atenolol (1 mg kg-1), caused a similar reduction in BP but in addition, significantly reduced cardiac function and PRA. 3. A combination of enalapril with atenolol, caused a significant reduction in BP, cardiac function and PRA, hence there was no elevation of PRA, as was seen following ACE-inhibition with enalapril alone. 4. The observations with beta-adrenoceptor blockade alone, show that there is an important homeostatic role for the renal sympathetic innervation, mediated by beta-adrenoceptors, in controlling basal renin levels. Furthermore, the renal sympathetic innervation appears to be an important contributor to the renin release caused by an ACE-inhibitor as the additional presence of a beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent will prevent this release. 5. BW B385C (2 mg kg-1), which combines both ACE-inhibition and beta-adrenoceptor blocking properties, also produced reductions in BP and cardiac function similar to those seen with the enalapril/atenolol combination. In addition, for an equivalent degree of ACE-inhibition by BW 385C, to that seen with enalapril alone, the elevation of PRA was attenuated. 6. A combination of ACE-inhibition and beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity in a single entity, such as BW B385C, therefore also produces a reduced renin release when compared with an ACE-inhibitor, such as enalapril. This provides further confirmation of the importance of the renal sympathetic innervation in the renin response to ACE-inhibition, and supports the concept of combining ACEinhibition with beta-adrenoceptor blockade.",

MORBIDITY, MORTALITY AND SURROGATE ENDPOINTS: Only diuretics and beta-blockers have been shown to benefit hypertensive patients in terms of the hard endpoints morbidity and mortality. beta-Blockers and diuretics are cheaper than newer drugs and thus represent good value for money. It is not acceptable to use drug effects on plasma lipids or insulin resistance as measures of the effects on coronary heart disease, since dihydropyridine calcium antagonists improve these parameters while significantly increasing coronary heart disease events in the acute and chronic ischaemic situation.

Diuretics appear particularly suited to elderly hypertensives, especially those with isolated systolic hypertension, but they may increase cardiac events in younger and middle-aged diabetic and non-diabetic hypertensives.

The aim was to clarify the action and safety of beta-blocker in the treatment of CHF. The results revealed that there was no statistical difference between beta-receptor density in CHF with cardiac function of degree I and II (516.57 +/- 85.93 fmol/10(7) cells, mean +/- s) and in normal controls (576.56 +/- 97.18 fmol/10(7) cells, P > 0.05), while beta-receptor density in CHF of degree III and IV was much lower than that in normal controls (decreased by 50%). There was no statistical difference of beta-receptor density between rheumatic heart disease and cardiomyopathy. Metoprolol up-regulated beta-receptor density from 302.40 +/- 100.91 to 459.60 +/- 174.34 fmol/10(7) cells (P < 0.05), but no change was observed after treatment by captopril. Ejection fraction was increased in both groups (P < 0.01). The results revealed that beta-receptor density was decreased in certain kinds of CHF but no relationship was observed between CHF of different etiology. beta-receptor density was up-regulated by beta-blocker, thus it indicates that it is rational to use beta-blocker for the treatment of certain kinds of CHF. And the use of small dose of beta-blocker with conventional therapy of heart failure might reduce the negative inotropic action of the former.", 
    "57": "The calcium antagonist nifedipine markedly relaxed intact rabbit aortic rings precontracted with low level potassium chloride while converting enzyme (CE) inhibitors, ramiprilat, enalaprilat, and captopril were only marginally effective. Either CE inhibitor combined with nifedipine, however, significantly accentuated this relaxation. The CE inhibitors increased vascular cyclic GMP content while nifedipine was not active. Thus, inhibition of potassium chloride-induced calcium influx by nifedipine may unmask the vasorelaxant potential of CE inhibitors that in turn may result from local accumulation of endothelium-derived bradykinin.",

Its stable expression in a variety of cell lines conferred some angiotensin responsiveness. To understand why mas-transfected cells exhibit a transformed phenotype and if angiotensin responsiveness plays any role in this process, we studied the growth characteristics of mas-transfected 3T3 cells and demonstrated that they lose contact inhibition, exhibit foci formation, and increased DNA synthesis even in absence of serum. Our results suggest that the transformed phenotype is due to the production of a mas receptor ligand distinct from angiotensin.", 
    "60": "Activity of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is usually measured in vitro by estimation of products cleaved by the enzyme from synthetic substrates. These substrates have affinities for ACE different from the natural substrate angiotensin I, and insensitive detection systems necessitate millimolar substrate concentrations while physiological angiotensin I concentrations are in the picomolar range. A new assay for ACE activity measurement was developed which reliably quantitates femtomoles of generated angiotensin II in plasma from angiotensin I added at a 17 pmol/mL concentration. The production of high affinity monoclonal antibodies against angiotensin II (Kd = 7 x 10(-11) mol/L) allowed a quantitative trapping (and thus protection from degrading enzymes) of angiotensin II generated during the incubation step and subsequent radioimmunoassay by simple dilution with labelled angiotensin II. Using 40 microL plasma, the detection limit was 20 fmol/mL/min. Normal human plasma has an ACE activity of 335 +/- 83 fmol/mL/min (mean +/- SD). Precision was characterized by coefficients of variation of less than or equal to 11% both within-assay and between-assays. Accuracy of the new method was established by comparing ACE activity with the ratio of plasma angiotensin II/angiotensin I in plasma obtained from normal volunteers 0.5 to 24 h after oral administration of 20 mg enalapril. The percentage of ACE inhibition indicated by both methods was almost identical (r = 0.93, n = 60, P less than .001). Since the latter ratio appears to reflect in vivo ACE activity, these results indicate that accurate measurement in vitro of ACE activity in vivo has been achieved.", 
    "61": "Twelve healthy male volunteers were given adrenaline infusions, 0.05 microgram/kg body weight/min over 120 minutes in order to achieve serum adrenaline concentrations comparable with those seen in acute myocardial infarction. The infusions were given on four occasions, at intervals of at least 4 weeks. Before the infusions the subjects were given, in random order, 14 days of pretreatment with placebo, hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg once daily, amiloride 10 mg once daily, or lisinopril 20 mg once daily. The adrenaline infusion induced a drop in serum potassium of the same magnitude in all four groups, with the lowest absolute value after hydrochlorothiazide because of the lowest pre-adrenaline level. The infusion-induced decreases in serum calcium and magnesium were of the same magnitude in all groups, with the absolute calcium being least low in the hydrochlorothiazide group because of the highest preinfusion value. Preinfusion serum urate was highest after hydrochlorothiazide and fell during the adrenaline infusion in all groups, although not significantly. Blood glucose increased during the adrenaline infusion in all groups, but significantly more after hydrochlorothiazide and amiloride than after lisinopril. Heart rate increased during the adrenaline infusion in all groups but least after lisinopril. QTc preinfusion was longer after hydrochlorothiazide than after amiloride and placebo, but the infusion-induced prolongation of QTc was of the same magnitude in all pretreatment groups. Since our results were obtained in short-term experiments in normal subjects, their clinical relevance is questionable, but they support the view that ACE inhibitors may have certain metabolic advantages over diuretics.", 
    "62": "Fifty-six hypertensive patients were recruited to participate in a 12 week, randomised, multicentre trial to compare the effects of lisinopril (n = 31) and low-dose trichlormethiazide (n = 25) administration on blood pressure and lipoprotein metabolism. Both systolic and diastolic BPs decreased significantly after administration of lisinopril (5-40mg/day, mean dose 11 mg/day) and trichlormethiazide (2.0-4.0 mg/day, mean dose 2.2 mg/day). There were no significant changes in lipids, lipoproteins or apolipoproteins with either drug for 12 weeks and no significant differences between the two drugs for these parameters. It is concluded that lisinopril and low-dose trichlormethiazide administration are effective antihypertensive measures without any adverse effects after 12 weeks on lipoprotein metabolism in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension.", 
    "63": "To determine the haemodynamic profile of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors during stress, the cardiovascular response to various stress tests was examined in patients with essential hypertension before and after three months of therapy with lisinopril. Eighteen white patients were enrolled in the trial, of whom 12 completed the protocol. ACE inhibition with lisinopril effectively reduced systolic and diastolic pressure in the office (P less than 0.001), at rest (P less than 0.002), during mental stress (P less than 0.003), cold pressor test (P less than 0.003), and reaction time task (P less than 0.05). During physical exercise only diastolic pressure was significantly reduced (P less than 0.02). The fall in peak systolic pressure during cold pressor test and reaction time task was more pronounced than the fall in casual systolic pressure (P less than 0.05). At rest, cardiac output was unchanged, but total peripheral resistance was reduced after medication with lisinopril (P less than 0.05). During the cold pressor test, the increase in total peripheral resistance was attenuated by ACE inhibition (P less than 0.04). The haemodynamic response profile was not altered during the other tests. It is concluded that in middle-aged men ACE inhibitors reduce blood pressure during a variety of stressful events without altering the haemodynamic profile and even attenuating vasoconstriction during stress. This response pattern to ACE inhibition with lisinopril may reduce the impact of recurring stress-induced increases of blood pressure and of exaggerated vasoconstrictive stimuli on the cardiovascular system.",

Scatchard analysis revealed no differences in receptor affinity but maximum density of binding sites was less in captopril-treated rats than in controls. Short-term incubation of cells with captopril or lisinopril did not affect angiotensin II binding in neuronal cultures from normotensive rats; however, angiotensin II binding was decreased in SHR cells treated with captopril. Angiotensin II binding was also decreased in SHR treated in utero with captopril.",

    "69": "Lisinopril is a potent competitive inhibitor of purified rabbit lung ACE (dissociation t1/2 = 105 min). To examine reversibility of binding and ACE functional activity in situ, the single-pass extraction (E) of an 125I-lisinopril analogue (351A) and the hydrolysis of an ACE substrate, benz-phe-ala-pro (BPAP) were studied. Lungs were perfused at 50 ml/min with a Krebs-albumin (3%) solution. A bolus containing [14C]dextran, [3H]BPAP, and 351A was injected and (E)351A measured by multiple indicator dilution technique. BPAP metabolism (M) was reflected by the appearance of its hydrolysis product [3H]benz-phe in lung effluent. Control (E)351A was 66 +/- 5% (mean +/- SD, n = 6) and (M)BPAP was 69 +/- 9% (n = 6). Unlabeled lisinopril (30 nmol) in the bolus significantly reduced E(351A) and M(BPAP) to 16 +/- 16% and 3 +/- 3%, respectively. Ten minutes later E(351A) and M(BPAP) had returned to control values. Reduction of E(351A) was partially reversible and M(BPAP) completely reversible after 1 min. After recirculation with 0.25 mM lisinopril for 30 min, however, significant depression of E(351A) was evident for 60 min after exposure to lisinopril was discontinued. Thus, rapid as well as slowly reversible components of inhibition of ACE inhibitor binding can be demonstrated in the perfused rabbit lung.", 
    "70": "1. Serum, tissue and urine angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) activity was estimated in the following groups of rats: saline-injected rats (controls); captopril-treated (CAP) control animals (CONTROL-CAP); puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN)-induced nephrotic syndrome (NS); and CAP-treated animals with NS (NS-CAP). 2. Serum ACE activity increased in the CONTROL-CAP, NS, and NS-CAP groups. The increase in the NS-CAP group was significantly higher compared with the NS or CONTROL-CAP groups. 3. In the CONTROL-CAP group, tissue ACE decreased in brain, heart and adrenal glands, and remained unchanged in the lung, testis, kidney, small intestine and liver. In the NS group, tissue ACE activity increased in the lung and testis, decreased in the brain and heart, and remained unchanged in the small intestine, adrenal glands, kidney and liver. Tissue ACE activity increased significantly in the NS-CAP group compared with the other groups. This increase in tissue ACE may contribute to an increase in the serum ACE activity in the NS-CAP group compared with the NS group. 4. Urine ACE activity increased in the NS and NS-CAP groups, although the rise in the NS-CAP group was significantly higher. The urine ACE correlated significantly with the circulating levels of this enzyme in the NS and NS-CAP groups. The loss of ACE in the urine in the presence of an increased serum ACE activity indicates that the biosynthesis of tissue ACE and its release into the bloodstream must be elevated.", 
    "71": "For several reasons, increasing numbers of patients with hypertension are treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium channel blockers. In a twenty-four week, double-blind, randomized, parallel study, the antihypertensive effect of lisinopril (20 to 80 mg qd) and nifedipine (20 to 80 mg bid) were compared in 21 patients. Fourteen patients received lisinopril (mean dose 35 mg), and 7 patients received nifedipine (mean dose 54 mg). By the end of week 12, 8 patients had responded (supine diastolic pressure less than or equal to 90 mg) to lisinopril and 5 to nifedipine. At the end of the study supine systolic/diastolic blood pressure was reduced from 172/104 to 149/92 mmHg with lisinopril and from 171/102 to 158/94 mmHg with nifedipine. No significant difference between the two treatments was detected. Three patients were reported to have at least one clinical adverse experience during the active treatment period, 1 in the lisinopril group and 2 in the nifedipine group. No serious clinical adverse experiences were recorded. In conclusion, lisinopril and nifedipine are both effective in reducing blood pressure in patients with mild to severe hypertension. Lisinopril qd and nifedipine slow release bid produce similar decreases in blood pressure after twelve weeks of therapy and the safety profiles of the two drugs are similar.", 
    "72": "We investigated the processing enzymes involved in the formation of circulating angiotensin-(1-7) after intravenous administration of angiotensin I to conscious spontaneously hypertensive and Wistar-Kyoto rats. Immunoreactive products, including angiotensin I, angiotensin II, and angiotensin-(1-7), were measured in arterial blood by three specific radioimmunoassays. Angiotensin I infusion (2 nmol) induced a rapid increase in immunoreactive angiotensin II and angiotensin-(1-7). Pretreatment with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalaprilat (2 mg/kg) eliminated angiotensin II formation and augmented circulating levels of angiotensin I and angiotensin-(1-7) in spontaneously hypertensive and Wistar-Kyoto rats. The elevated levels of angiotensin-(1-7) in enalaprilat-treated rats were blocked by concurrent treatment with the neutral endopeptidase (EC 3.4.24.11) inhibitor SCH 39,370 (15 mg/kg) in both strains. Administration of SCH 39,370 alone decreased angiotensin-(1-7) levels in spontaneously hypertensive rats, whereas angiotensin II levels increased in both strains (p less than 0.01). Comparisons of the metabolism of angiotensin I in the two rat strains showed increased formation of angiotensin-(1-7) in spontaneously hypertensive rats not given any of the enzyme inhibitors. In addition, levels of angiotensin I were higher after administration of SCH 39,370 in hypertensive rats. These novel findings reveal that neutral endopeptidase EC 3.4.24.11 participates in the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin-(1-7) and in the metabolism of angiotensin II in the circulation of both spontaneously hypertensive and Wistar-Kyoto rats. Our results suggest that neutral endopeptidase EC 3.4.24.11 is a major enzymatic constituent of the circulating renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "73": "To assess the role of the vascular angiotensin II-generating system in one-kidney, one clip hypertension, we determined the angiotensin converting enzyme activity in plasma and vascular tissues and examined the pressor response to angiotensin II, angiotensin I, and tetradecapeptide renin substrate in isolated mesenteric arteries from one-kidney, one clip hypertensive rats 7 and 30 days after clipping the renal artery and in mesenteric arteries from age-matched normotensive rats. Angiotensin converting enzyme activity, determined in aortic and mesenteric tissues, was significantly augmented in the hypertensive (30 days after clipping) group, whereas plasma activity was normal. The vasoconstrictor responses elicited by angiotensin I and tetradecapeptide in arteries from hypertensive rats were found to be significantly potentiated 30 days after clipping, whereas the angiotensin II responses were basically unchanged. Saralasin completely blocked the vasoconstrictor responses, whereas captopril blocked only the responses to angiotensin I without affecting the responses elicited by angiotensin II and tetradecapeptide. Enalapril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor given intravenously to unanesthetized rats, significantly lowered the blood pressure of hypertensive rats. The pressor responses elicited by angiotensin II, angiotensin I, and tetradecapeptide were completely inhibited by saralasin, whereas enalapril blocked only the responses of angiotensin I but not those elicited by angiotensin II and tetradecapeptide. These results indicate that local formation of angiotensin II is increased in arteries of one-kidney, one clip hypertensive rats. The data obtained with tetradecapeptide renin substrate suggest an important role for nonrenin proteases in vascular angiotensin II formation.", 
    "74": "T cell stimulation by the human immunodeficiency virus 1 gp160-derived peptide p18 presented by H-2Dd class I major histocompatibility complex molecules in a cell-free system was found to require proteolytic cleavage. This extracellular processing was mediated by peptidases present in fetal calf serum. In vitro processing of p18 resulted in a distinct reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography profile, from which a biologically active product was isolated and sequenced. This peptide processing can be specifically blocked by the angiotensin-1 converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril, and can occur by exposing p18 to purified ACE. The ability of naturally occurring extracellular proteases to convert inactive peptides to T cell antigens has important implications for understanding cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses in vivo, and for rational peptide vaccine design.",

ACE activity has been shown to be dynamically regulated by hormones, ACE inhibitors, and endothelial cell growth state. To study how ACE expression is regulated, we isolated and sequenced the bovine ACE gene using both ACE-specific cDNA and genomic clones. Bovine ACE cDNA encodes a single polypeptide of 1,306 residues with a molecular mass of 150 kd. Bovine ACE is approximately 80% homologous to that of other species. It contains two homologous domains of equal size. Alignment of ACE sequences from bovine, human, mouse, and rabbit reveals that during evolution both domains have been highly conserved. We used the bovine ACE cDNA to study regulation of ACE gene expression during density-dependent growth arrest. As endothelial cells became growth-arrested (6 days after confluence), there was a 12-fold increase in ACE activity and a 90% decrease in DNA synthesis. Immunocytochemically detectable ACE markedly increased in growth-arrested cells. The increase in ACE was due to increased ACE gene expression, as assayed by RNase protection, which showed a 20-fold increase in ACE-specific mRNA. The present study shows that bovine ACE is highly regulated by endothelial cell growth state at the level of protein and mRNA expression. Such dynamic regulation may have important consequences for angiotensin II production during endothelial cell proliferation after arterial injury.", 
    "76": "The authors investigated in ten patients with essential hypertension changes in the membrane transport of sodium in red blood cells and the intracellular calcium content of thrombocytes during the control period during treatment of hypertension with central sympatholytics and after three-week treatment with an inhibitor of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), enalapril. The effect of enalapril in hypertonic patients was manifested by a rise of the renin plasma activity and the potassium concentration and a reduction of the sodium plasma concentration which corresponds to the inhibition of angiotensin II. The intracellular calcium and sodium content was unaltered. In 8 of 10 patients after enalapril treatment increased values of Vmax for Na(+)-K+ cotransport occurred, incl. 6 patients where at the same time a rise of Vmax Na(+)-Li+ countertransport was recorded.", 
    "77": "Symptoms of chronic cardiac failure depend on four determinants: The initial event concerns a decrease in contractility. The resulting complex neurohumoral regulatory mechanisms are essentially sympathicomimetic and stimulate the renin-angiotensin system. Accordingly, pre- and afterload will increase and symptoms may become aggravated by dys- or arrhythmias. Symptomatic pharmacotherapy of cardiac failure is directed to these four determinants. The actual rationale for its use is presented, putting emphasis on the renewed controversy on digitalis and on the importance of vasodilators, in particular ACE inhibitors. The relevance of diagnostic evaluation before and during treatment is indicated. The adaptation of treatment according to different causative disorders leading to cardiac failure is outlined. Finally, open questions and unsolved problems are brought up.",

    "83": "A new series of renin inhibitors has been developed. The inhibitors feature a novel replacement for the P2/P3 dipeptide moiety normally associated with renin inhibitors. The dipeptide replacement was a (2S,4S)-3-aza(or oxa)-2,4-dialkylglutaric acid amide. Extensive structure-activity relationship studies determined that optimum potency was achieved when inhibitors employed a benzyl and butyl group at the C(4) and C(2) carbon position, respectively. In addition, maximum in vitro potency was obtained when the N-terminus was functionalized by incorporating a 4-(1,3-dioxabutyl)piperidine amide. SAR data suggested that the 1,3-dioxabutyl group (methoxymethyl ether) interacted by hydrogen bonding to groups in the S4 domain of renin. This hypothesis was strengthened when a 4-butylpiperidine amide was substituted and inhibitor potency decreased dramatically. Inhibitors employing this novel dipeptide mimic were prepared by coupling the glutaric acid amides with either the transition-state mimic (2S,3R,4S)-2-amino-1-cyclohexyl-3,4-dihydroxy-6- methylheptane (18) or the hydroxyethylene dipeptide isostere. The glutaric acid amides were prepared by two general procedures. The first procedure involved the reductive amination of alpha-amino acid esters with alpha-keto esters. The second procedure involved the displacement reaction of alpha-bromo esters or acids with alpha-amino acid amides.", 
    "84": "MK 954 (DuP 753), a recently developed angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor antagonist, was administered orally for 2 weeks to spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). Whereas the basal levels of plasma Ang II were lower in SHR than in WKY, treatment with MK 954 markedly reduced blood pressure in SHR but not in WKY. Plasma renin activity, Ang I and Ang II were increased, while plasma aldosterone was decreased in both strains. These results no only indicate therapeutic efficacy of this agent in the chronic treatment of human hypertension, but also support the idea that the renin-angiotensin system plays an important role in the control of blood pressure in SHR.", 
    "85": "There is evidence that cardiac hypertrophy in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) occurs before the development of hypertension. 1,2-Diacylglycerol, which is thought to be a second messenger activating protein kinase C, is also produced in excess in SHR hearts at 4 weeks of age, before established hypertension. We determined myocardial 1,2-diacylglycerol content in SHR with and without prazosin and enalapril from 3 to 4 weeks of age. Hearts from untreated SHR had greater RNA and DNA synthesis and greater relative weights at 4 weeks of age than those from Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. There was no difference in triglyceride content or phospholipid species between WKY rats and untreated SHR, except for a higher cholesterol content in SHR. Treatment of SHR with enalapril, but not prazosin, lowered not only 1,2-diacylglycerol content but also RNA synthesis to the levels of WKY rats. Moreover, fatty acids involved in 1,2-diacylglycerol were altered by enalapril despite the lack of a difference between WKY rats and untreated SHR. Prazosin did not have any effect on 1,2-diacylglycerol fatty acid composition. Enalapril may decrease cardiac hypertrophy in SHR by lowering myocardial 1,2-diacylglycerol production.", 
    "86": "Antibody microprobes bearing antibodies to the C-terminus of substance P (SP) were used to measure release of immunoreactive (ir) SP in the dorsal horn of barbiturate anaesthetized spinal cats. Electrical stimulation of unmyelinated primary afferents of the ipsilateral tibial nerve produced a relatively localised release of ir SP in the superficial dorsal horn. Prior microinjection of the peptidase inhibitors kelatorphan and enalaprilat in the dorsal horn resulted in ir SP being detected over the whole of the dorsal horn and the overlying dorsal column. This pattern had previously been observed with evoked release of ir neurokinin A and supports the proposal that a slow degradation results in a neuropeptide accessing many sites remote from sites of release.", 
    "87": "Inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) may cause angioneurotic oedema. In order to define the clinical spectrum of this important adverse effect, we analysed data on 60 patients with angioneurotic oedema notified to the Drug Commission of the German Medical Association, after taking captopril (n = 24), enalapril (n = 25) or lisinopril (n = 11). In 48 cases the oedema affected the face, tongue and pharynx, while swelling of the extremities (n = 4), the trunk (n = 2) or the genitalia (n = 1) was observed less frequently. While oedema appeared most often after 1 to 21 days, it started within an hour in one patient, and only after 6 months of therapy in five patients. After discontinuation of the ACE inhibitor, the angioneurotic oedema resolved within 72 hours; additional therapeutic measures (glucocorticoids, antihistamines, adrenaline, C1 inhibitors) did not shorten the recovery time. In view of the increasing use of ACE inhibitors, the features of this unusual adverse reaction need to be widely recognized, since angioneurotic oedema of the larynx is potentially life-threatening.", 
    "88": "Albumins from several species activated the bifunctional, Zn2+ metalloenzyme amino-peptidase/leukotriene A4 hydrolase (EC 3.3.2.6). Bovine serum albumin, 1 mg/mL, increased hydrolysis of L-proline-p-nitroanilide and leucine-enkephalin by 12-fold and 7-fold, respectively. The apparent Km for L-proline-p-nitroanilide was inversely proportional to the albumin concentration from 0 to 1 mg/mL, declining from 9.4 to 0.7 mM without an appreciable change in apparent Vmax. These data imply a random activation process in which the enzyme-activator complex is catalytically dominant. Hill plots indicated a 1:1 stoichiometric relationship between albumin and enzyme. Secondary plots of slope versus the reciprocal of albumin concentration indicated that it binds to the enzyme with an affinity constant of 0.9 microM. The pH optimum of the nonactivated enzyme occurred at pH 8; the albumin-activated enzyme had an optimum near pH 7. Neither ultrafiltration nor dialysis of albumin altered its activating effect, but boiling abolished it. Albumin did not affect other cytosolic or microsomal leucine aminopeptidases, or gamma-glutamyltransferase. Albumin functions as a nonessential activator, since enzymatic activity was always detectable in its absence. Chloride ions, which activate other Zn2+ metalloenzymes, also activated leukotriene A4 hydrolase/aminopeptidase with an EC50 = 50 mM, increasing its initial velocity 2.2-fold in the absence of albumin. Zn2+ activated the enzyme, increasing its apparent Vmax but not its apparent Km, suggesting it replaced Zn2+ lost from the active site, especially at acidic pH. At concentrations greater than 30-50 microM, Zn2+ was inhibitory. Albumin mitigated the effect of chloride, but not the effect of Zn2+ or that of the competitive inhibitor, captopril.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "89": "The effect of captopril on infarct size and arrhythmias was determined in a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind study of 46 patients (9 women, 37 men; mean age 61 [38-86] years). Within 2-18 hours of entry into the study these patients received either a slow intravenous bolus injection of 2.5 or 5.0 mg captopril followed by a continuous infusion of 1.5-2.0 mg/h for a period of 48 hours (n = 22), or of a placebo by the same mode of administration (n = 24). The two groups were comparable as to age, infarct site and time of intervention. All patients, except one in each group, also received nitroglycerin (1.2-6.0 mg/h intravenously). QRS complexes were measured to provide a necrosis index. Q-wave amplitudes decreased under captopril (-0.08 +/- 0.04 mV) while increasing under placebo (+0.15 +/- 0.04 mV; P less than 0.05). The number of ventricular extrasystoles in the first 24 hours after onset of treatment or on placebo was 25/h and 9/h, respectively (P less than 0.02). Ventricular fibrillation occurred in 7 patients of the placebo group, in none of the captopril group. Creatine-kinase infarct weight was 59 and 45 gram-equivalents, respectively (placebo vs treated group: not significant). The mean arterial blood pressure fell by 14 mm Hg during the first hour in the captopril group, but by only 3 mm Hg on placebo (P less than 0.01). These results indicate that captopril has a favourable influence on infarct size and electrical stability which is additional to that provided by standard nitroglycerin treatment.",

Equivalent patients aged 45, 60 and 75 years would be prescribed a diuretic as drug of first choice in 41%, 55% and 68% of cases respectively. Despite this, there are wide differences in the choice of initial therapy between individual practitioners. These differences can have a substantial cost impact, given that in Australia the cost of diuretic therapy for one month can be as low as $1.97 compared with $34.08 for standard angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor therapy for one month. There was also a perceived need, and demand, for patient education materials to assist practitioners in the drug treatment of hypertension.",

A Bruce stress test was obtained before and after administration of conventional treatment with captopril or placebo. The captopril induced less systolic pressure elevation during maximal exercise without modification of heart rate. By decreasing myocardial oxygen consumption, increasing the time in which angina appears during exercise. Captopril may prove to be useful adjunct to the antianginal drug regimens of patients with stable angina and systolic arterial pressure greater than 110 mm Hg.", 
    "94": "We evaluated the effect of captopril treatment on left ventricular mass (LVM) and function in sustained mild-to-moderate primary hypertension. In 16 men aged 34.5 +/- 6.4 yrs. M-mode echo and pulsed wave Doppler recordings were obtained prior to and after 2 months captopril treatment (50-150 mg daily). No significant changes in heart rate, systolic blood pressure, ejection fraction, fractional shortening, cardiac output, LVM and Doppler-derived indices of mitral inflow were observed. Diastolic blood pressure measured during examination fell from 102.2 +/- 13.3 to 90.3 +/- 9 mmHg (p less than 0.026). No consistent correlations between catecholamines and indexes of left ventricular function were found. Two-month captopril therapy in mild-to-moderate hypertension results in diastolic blood pressure lowering with no effect on LVM or left ventricular function.", 
    "95": "We studied a group of 30 patients to determine the effect of captopril on the exercise training response after a period of training in patients with ischemic heart disease but without cardiac failure. The study was a double-blind placebo-controlled comparison of captopril and placebo. The patients studied were 28 men and 2 women, mean age 53.6 +/- 6.9 years. All were 8 to 12 weeks postmyocardial infarction or coronary artery bypass surgery. These patients underwent an organized exercise training program consisting of exercise training sessions 3 times weekly for a period of 8 weeks. On commencement and completion of the program patients were assessed for exercise tolerance using submaximal exercise stress testing. Patients were assessed in the untreated state. Both groups showed a statistically significant training effect with increased exercise duration, decreased heart rate for equal workload, increased energy expenditure, and reduced functional aerobic impairment. There was no statistically significant change in systolic blood pressure, but the captopril group alone showed a significant reduction in diastolic blood pressure (p less than 0.001). The change in heart rate at rest over the 8-week period was not significant in both groups. In summary, this study shows that treatment with captopril does not affect the exercise training response in patients with ischemic heart disease undergoing an organized exercise training program.", 
    "96": "Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a disorder characterized by a variety of clinical, biochemical, electrophysiological, and hemodynamic abnormalities. During the past two decades, numerous drugs have been employed in the treatment of this complex syndrome, and many agents have been shown to improve symptoms and ventricular function in patients with CHF. Because CHF is associated with a high risk of death, treatment should be directed not only toward the relief of symptoms, but also toward a reduction in mortality. Many variables have been shown to be related to survival; taken individually, however, each is limited in its utility in predicting prognosis. In recent years, large-scale studies with large sample sizes have directly assessed the effects of treatment on mortality in CHF. Results from these trials indicate that vasodilators and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may improve mortality in patients with symptoms of heart failure. Additional trials are now in progress to evaluate the effect of treatment on patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction.",

Nevertheless, this test was only marginally superior to a careful analysis of the supine values where a similar ratio in the presence of a normal or suppressed plasma renin activity predicted primary hyperaldosteronism with a sensitivity also of 100% but a slightly lower specificity of 75% and predictive value of 77%.",

Effect of order of treatment was evaluated in rats receiving perindopril plus HCTZ. Time course of changes in systolic blood pressure, heart rate, 24 h urine volume and urinary excretion of sodium, potassium and chloride were studied and compared for all groups. HCTZ alone and lower dosages of perindopril (0.1 mg/kg, 0.3 mg/kg) were ineffective in lowering elevated systolic blood pressure of the spontaneously hypertensive rat, and there were no significant intergroup differences in urine volume and electrolytes. However, antihypertensive efficacy of lower dosages of perindopril was significantly (P less than 0.01) enhanced when administered in combination with HCTZ. The combined treatment also induced significant (P less than 0.01) diuresis and urinary chloride excretion. No significant effect was seen in heart rate. The dose-effect relationship of the combination confirmed the existence of synergistic antihypertensive action between HCTZ and perindopril in the spontaneously hypertensive rat.", 
    "104": "Thirty-six patients (33 male, 3 female) with a mean age of 67 years and a diastolic blood pressure between 95 and 115 mm Hg, after a four-week placebo run-in period entered a double-blind crossover study comparing felodipine 5 and 10 mg with enalapril 5 and 10 mg and their combination (enalapril 5 mg + felodipine 5 mg). Combined therapy caused a fall in blood pressure of 24/16 mm Hg at trough level that was greater than the falls with the higher doses of monotherapy. The fall with felodipine was greater than with enalapril. Similar patients responded to felodipine and enalapril but more patients achieved blood pressure control with felodipine. When patients not controlled with enalapril 5 mg had felodipine 5 mg or enalapril 5 mg added, felodipine was more effective at lowering blood pressure than the increase in enalapril dosage. A similar effect occurred in those not controlled with felodipine 5 mg. Adverse effects occurred in 22 patients on felodipine, 14 patients on enalapril and 8 on combined therapy. The lipoprotein profile was not altered significantly. Glomerular filtration rates as assessed by 24-hour creatinine clearance were 90 ml/min at randomization, 125 ml/min on felodipine, 108 ml/min on enalapril and 120 ml/min on the combination. Felodipine and enalapril in low doses are effective antihypertensive agents in elderly people. Felodipine monotherapy is more effective than enalapril monotherapy but a greater blood pressure lowering effect can be obtained with the combination of low doses of enalapril and felodipine. This has the advantage that the number of side effects is less.", 
    "105": "The pathogenesis of progressive renal disease includes systemic hypertension and intrarenal factors that may be hemodynamic or metabolic in origin and involve mediators of inflammation. Most current information derives from experiments in rodents. In other species (rabbit, dog, baboon) subjected to renal mass reduction, a greater variety of pathologic changes is apparent than in rats. Clinical trials at controlling progression of renal disease are compounded by numerous factors; and it is not evident that extrapolation can safely be made from results of animal studies to human disease. The mechanism(s) of renal disease progression in humans, therefore, remain largely unknown. Current therapeutic recommendations in patients with chronic renal disease include limitation of phosphorus absorption, correction of lipid abnormalities and control of systemic blood pressure. The latter can be achieved with a variety of agents some of which, like angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium antagonists, may be preferred because of specific intrarenal effects.", 
    "106": "Cytosolic [Ca2+] can be increased by influx of the ion from the extracellular compartment, Ca2+ release from intracellular storage sites, and/or a reduced activity of active transport processes for Ca2+ extrusion or sequestration. Organic calcium antagonists block transmembrane calcium entry and, therefore, can be utilized to evaluate the importance of calcium influx in the regulation of renal hemodynamics. Recent studies indicate that calcium antagonists selectively vasodilate preglomerular arterioles, leading to increases in renal blood flow (RBF), glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and glomerular pressure. In contrast with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and other vasodilator agents, calcium antagonists primarily influence the component of renal vascular resistance responsible for autoregulation, potently attenuating autoregulatory efficiency. Calcium antagonists also block the afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction elicited by angiotensin II, while not influencing the efferent arteriolar vasoconstriction evoked by this peptide. Tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF)-mediated vasoconstrictor responses are also abolished by calcium antagonists, indicating that the TGF effector mechanism may require transmembrane calcium influx into the smooth muscle cells of the afferent arterioles. These observations provide compelling evidence that calcium influx, through pathways which are influenced by organic calcium antagonists, is an integral component of the afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction elicited by a variety of stimuli, while efferent arteriolar vasoconstriction appears to depend on other calcium access pathways.", 
    "107": "The effects of a nonselective beta-adrenergic blocking drug with beta-2 agonist activity (dilevalol 200 mg) on proteinuria and renal hemodynamics were evaluated in a double-blind crossover study versus an ACE inhibitor (enalapril 5 mg) in eight patients with glomerulonephritis, moderate renal function impairment and proteinuria greater than 1 g/24 hr. Patients were studied after a one week placebo phase while off all other medications, except steroids in a few cases, and after three weeks of treatment. A 10-day placebo washout perod was included between the various drug treatments. During each period renal hemodynamics were measured by clearance techniques, and urinary protein excretion as well as fractional clearance of albumin and IgG were determined. Both drugs reduced mean arterial pressure and proteinuria to a similar extent [mean arterial pressure: placebo 108 +/- 13 mm Hg; dilevalol 103 +/- 11 mm Hg (P less than 0.05); enalapril 103 +/- 12 mm Hg (P less than 0.05); protein excretion: placebo 5.1 +/- 4.2 g/day; dilevalol 3.3 +/- 3.0 g/day (P less than 0.05); enalapril 2.8 +/- 2.8 g/day (P less than 0.05)]. The antiproteinuric effect was greater with enalapril than dilevalol. Dilevalol reduced GFR [baseline inulin clearance: 73.3 +/- 38 ml/min/1.73 m2; after dilevalol: 63.3 +/- 28 ml/min/1.73 m2 (P less than 0.05)] and the decrease of proteinuria correlated positively with the reduction of GFR. Enalapril did not significantly lower the GFR (inulin clearance during enalapril 66.8 +/- 23 ml/min/1.73 m2) and the reduction of proteinuria did not correlate with the lowering of the GFR.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The gastrointestinal transit and pulsatile release were followed using gamma scintigraphy. A pulsatile capsule system with release after a nominal 5-hr period was found to perform reproducibly in vitro and in vivo. In six of the eight subjects, the drug was delivered to the colon, and in the remaining two subjects, to the terminal ileum. Measurable blood levels of free captopril were found in three subjects. Variable instability of the drug in the distal intestine is suggested as a possible reason for the lack of absorption of the drug in the majority of subjects.", 
    "109": "Changes of glucose and lipid metabolism in NIDDM hypertensive patients during treatment with a new dihydropyridine derivative, nilvadipine, were examined by a randomized, crossover study comparing the results with those elicited by captopril in 18 patients for 12 weeks each. Nilvadipine (8 mg per day) and captopril retard (75 mg per day) caused a sufficient decrease in blood pressure without changing the pulse rate. Nilvadipine and captopril did not significantly change fasting plasma glucose, hemoglobin A1c, serum cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol or apoprotein A-I, A-II and B levels in either of the 12-week treatments. In 75-g oral glucose tolerance tests carried out three times in each patient (before treatment and after 12 weeks of treatment with each drug), changes in plasma glucose and serum insulin levels were not significantly different among the three tests. These results demonstrate that nilvadipine as well as captopril are antihypertensive drugs without adverse effects on glucose and lipid metabolism in hypertensive patients with NIDDM.", 
    "110": "Multiunit and single-unit recordings of afferent renal nerve activity (ARNA) were obtained in anesthetized spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats between 35 and 150 days of age. Intrapelvic backflow of urine at 20 mmHg excited ARNA at all ages in SHR (152 +/- 18% above control) and WKY rats (262 +/- 24%). In SHR, complete renal ischemia was more excitatory in rats older than 120 days (1,233 +/- 103%, n = 8) than in younger SHR (317 +/- 28%, n = 42). Single-unit recordings showed that this was related to the appearance of R1 chemoreceptors in older SHR and coincided with a decline in the proportion of R2 chemoreceptors in the renal nerves. Other chemoreceptive responses were identified in single units that did not show complete R1 or R2 characteristics, some of which showed responses consistent with a transformation process from R2 to R1 receptor type. R1 chemoreceptors were not present in WKY rats studied up to 150 days of age and, unlike SHR, the proportion of R2 chemoreceptors did not decline with age. Accordingly, complete renal ischemia in WKY rats caused a comparable excitation in multiunit ARNA at all ages (285 +/- 33%, n = 43). Oral enalapril from weaning to 100 days of age prevented hypertension in SHR but did not impair the responsiveness of ARNA to any stimulus. In WKY rats, enalapril treatment for the same period resulted in exaggerated ARNA response to renal ischemia (1,250 +/- 377% above control).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Seventy-four mildly to moderately hypertensive patients (mean seated blood pressure, 150/101 mm Hg) received enalapril 10 mg once daily as initial monotherapy. In 66 patients, the seated diastolic blood pressure remained greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg at the trough blood levels of enalapril. Transdermal clonidine (3.5 cm2, 7.0 cm2, or 10.5 cm2, equivalent to 0.1 mg, 0.2 mg, and 0.3 mg clonidine/day, respectively) then was added as needed to achieve blood pressure control. Forty-eight patients achieved diastolic blood pressures less than 90 mm Hg on concomitant therapy; 44 patients completed 8 weeks of maintenance dosing with a mean blood pressure of 134/85 mm Hg. Oral compliance, as measured by an electronic device that was actuated each time the medication vial was opened, varied from 48 to 140%. Compliance with the transdermal clonidine regimen was excellent; the patch was worn as directed during 96% of the patient-weeks of therapy. The authors conclude that blood pressure can be controlled by a combination of transdermal clonidine and enalapril in patients that do not adequately respond to enalapril monotherapy. Patients poorly complying with oral regimens may be candidates for a trial of transdermal clonidine monotherapy.",

These reactions were severe in 11 cases. In eight patients, anaphylactoid reactions stopped when AN69 membrane was replaced by polysulfone membrane and ACE inhibitors were continued. In one case, reducing the dose of ACE inhibitors was sufficient to prevent new reactions. Anaphylactoid reactions did not occur in patients undergoing dialysis with another membrane (cellulosic or synthetic), nor in those on AN69 membrane without ACE inhibitor treatment. We conclude that back-filtration of endotoxin-contaminated dialysate does not play the main role in the origin of such reactions, since they occurred in patients on hemofiltration with sterile and pyrogen-free substitution liquids.", 
    "114": "The antihypertensive effect of captopril, metoprolol, and hydrochlorothiazide was compared in 23 non-insulin-dependent (NIDDM) diabetic patients less than or equal to 75 years of age, with borderline to moderate primary hypertension. In a double blind, placebo-controlled cross-over trial the patients were treated with 25 to 50 mg captopril, 50 to 100 mg metoprolol, 12.5 to 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide, and placebo, each given twice daily for 8 weeks. Antidiabetic treatment remained unchanged during the study. After receiving placebo for a 4 week run-in period, arterial blood pressure was 168/101 +/- 93/10 (mean +/- SEM) mm Hg. Diastolic blood pressure was lowered significantly during all active treatment periods compared to the placebo value of 97 +/- 2 mm Hg: captopril, 92 +/- 1 mm Hg; metoprolol, 90 +/- 1 mm Hg; hydrochlorothiazide, 91 +/- 1 mm Hg. Metabolic variables were not significantly altered by captopril and metoprolol, while hydrochlorothiazide treatment increased hemoglobin A1c from 7.5 +/- 0.3 to 8.2 +/- 0.4% (P less than .001), decreased high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol from 1.19 +/- 0.08 to 1.10 +/- 0.06 mmol/L (P less than .05). Glomerular filtration rate, urinary albumin excretion, orthostatic blood pressure response, and digital systolic blood pressure in the lower limb remained unchanged during the active treatment periods. The frequency of subjective adverse effects was acceptable during active treatment and not significantly different compared to placebo. We conclude that antihypertensive treatment for 8 weeks with captopril or metoprolol in NIDDM patients is well-tolerated and causes no deterioration in metabolic control and kidney function, while hydrochlorothiazide causes a slight deterioration in glycemic control and lipid profile.", 
    "115": "This case report demonstrates that the antihypertensive effects of captopril were neutralized by the concomitant administration of ibuprofen. If elderly patients on ACE inhibitors show evidence of a \"noncompliant\" worsening of their hypertension, a thorough review of all the patient's medications, including the use of over-the-counter ibuprofen, should be undertaken.", 
    "116": "The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors available today include captopril (Capoten), enalapril (Vasotec), enaloprilat (Vasotec IV), lisinopril (Prinivil, Zestril), benazepril (Lotensin), fosinopril (Monopril), and ramipril (Atace). These drugs are used in the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure. They also are used in treating renovascular hypertension not amenable to surgery and are being studied to decrease left ventricular size after infarction and to determine whether they slow the rate of internal hyperplasia. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have negative inotropic and chronotropic effects. This chapter discusses the ACE inhibitors and their actions, uses, adverse effects, contraindications, and nursing implications.", 
    "117": "Clinical studies indicate that the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor quinapril is an effective antihypertensive agent when administered once daily. At the end of a 4-week, double-blind crossover trial comparing quinapril and placebo, patients were admitted for a hemodynamic profile study 12 hours after taking the previous dose. A final 20 mg dose of quinapril had no additional effect on blood pressure. This is interesting inasmuch as the plasma half-life of the active metabolite quinaprilat is approximately 2 hours and the effective accumulation half-life is approximately 3 hours. The blood pressure reduction in patients with mild hypertension receiving long-term quinapril therapy may be more closely related to prolonged angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition or to an effect on tissue angiotensin II concentration than to the plasma half-life. This may be the case particularly for cardiac output and renal circulation, because quinapril lowers total vascular resistance without increasing cardiac output or disturbing autoregulation of renal blood flow. Reduced ventricular wall stress, improved diastolic function, and lower renal perfusion pressure may spare cardiac function and glomeruli from hypertensive vascular damage.", 
    "118": "The efficacy and safety of once-daily administration of the new angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor quinapril or quinapril plus hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) were assessed in 64 older (greater than 65 years) patients with mild to moderate hypertension in an uncontrolled, open-label study. Treatment was initiated with 20 mg of quinapril once daily and titrated upward to 40 mg of quinapril or 40 mg of quinapril combined with 25 mg of HCTZ according to efficacy. At the end of the 12-week active-treatment phase, 43 patients received 20 mg of quinapril once daily, 12 patients received 40 mg of quinapril once daily, and 4 patients received 40 mg of quinapril combined with 25 mg of HCTZ once daily. Of 48 patients evaluable for efficacy, the mean decrease from baseline in sitting diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was 12.8 mm Hg; 96% of the patients had a blood pressure reduction of greater than or equal to 10 mm Hg, and 98% had a sitting DBP of less than or equal to 90 mm Hg 20 to 28 hours after administration. The decrease in sitting DBP was significant after 1 week and continued for the entire study, as did corresponding changes in sitting systolic blood pressure. We conclude that quinapril administered once daily is well tolerated and effective for the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension in elderly patients.", 
    "119": "Twenty-four-hour noninvasive ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was used to study the antihypertensive effect of morning (8 AM) versus evening (10 PM) administration of the new angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor quinapril, 20 mg. Eighteen patients with mild to moderate hypertension were studied in a double-blind, crossover fashion after 2 weeks of placebo for 4 weeks of each of the two active treatments. The results show that 20 mg of quinapril given once daily is effective in lowering blood pressure levels throughout a 24-hour period. The 24-hour blood pressure profiles showed a more sustained antihypertensive effect with an evening dose of quinapril compared with a morning dose of quinapril; with the morning dose a smaller reduction in blood pressure was observed during nighttime hours. Evening administration seems preferable, because it produces a more sustained and stable 24-hour blood pressure control probably through a more favorable modulation of tissue angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition or effect on the adrenergic-induced rise in blood pressure that occurs during early morning hours.", 
    "120": "The antihypertensive effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors cannot be fully explained by their actions on the circulating renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Agents such as captopril or enalapril maintain efficacy during long-term therapy even when plasma concentrations of converting enzyme or angiotensin II are not fully suppressed. Components of the entire RAS exist at several sites, thereby making it possible for drugs to produce effects at extracirculatory locations. An ACE inhibitor such as quinapril that has a comparatively short plasma concentration half-life binds strongly to plasma ACE as well as to ACE in key tissues including artery wall, heart, and kidney. The effects of ACE inhibition on the tissue RAS are of potential importance in fully explaining the blood pressure-lowering effects of these drugs. ACE inhibitors might also reduce blood pressure by blocking nonhemodynamic actions of angiotensin II. They affect vascular properties by increasing compliance of arteries and they act on baroreceptors and central regulatory mechanisms. Furthermore, ACE inhibitors affect other neuroendocrine systems, including aldosterone, kinins, and prostaglandins; attenuation of sympathetic activity can contribute further to their antihypertensive properties. Actions independent of circulating renin effects do not necessarily require plasma ACE inhibition throughout a 24-hour period. Sustained antihypertensive effects by drugs with short durations of plasma ACE inhibition give credibility to therapeutic targets beyond the circulating RAS.", 
    "121": "Antihypertensive agents may modify the renal effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition (ACEI). This potential interaction, which is important in the diagnosis of renovascular hypertension was studied in two rat models with and without diuretic treatment prior to ACEI. Acute intravenous administration of furosemide or hydrochlorothiazide in one-kidney, one-clamp animals (1K1C) did not change glomerular filtration rate (GFR) or effective renal plasma flow (ERPF). ACEI administration after furosemide and hydrochlorothiazide decreased GFR (p less than 0.001, p less than 0.01) but not ERPF. Chlorothiazide administered to 1K1C prior to ACEI, decreased GFR (p less than 0.02) but not ERPF captopril administration to 1K1C which received hydrochlorothiazide intraperitoneally for 7-10 days decreased GFR (p less than 0.007) and ERPF (p less than 0.02), while two-kidney, one-clamp animals (2K1C) decreased GFR only in the clamped kidney (p less than 0.005). ERPF in 2K1C increased only in the contralateral kidney (p less than 0.01). Without diuretic 1K1C animals decreased GFR and ERPF after ACEI (p less than 0.005, P less than 0.001). In the clamped kidney of 2K1C rats, GFR and ERPF decreased significantly (p less than 0.0005, p less than 0.004) and contralateral kidney ERPF increased (p less than 0.001), but GFR did not. The consequences of ACEI on GFR are similar with or without diuretic. These data suggest that diuretic therapy may not significantly interfere with ACEI evaluation of renovascular hypertension.", 
    "122": "The influence of long-term oral administration of enalapril maleate (an angiotensin II-converting enzyme inhibitor) on regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was studied in 10 patients with chronic cerebral infarction. The rCBF was measured by a 133Xe inhalation method before and after a mean of sixty-five days' administration of 5 mg of enalapril.", 
    "123": "Mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) was mildly decreased in 6 patients, but the average change in MABP was not significant (Endtidal partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PeC02) was not changed significantly. The mean rCBF was increased by 8% after administration of enalapril (0.05 less than p less than 0.1) There was no significant correlation between percent change in MABP and the percent change in rCBF. These results indicate that enalapril has not only antihypertensive action but also a beneficial effect on the cerebral circulation in patients with chronic cerebral infarction.", 
    "124": "Cine nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging was used to serially measure cardiovascular function in 17 patients with New York Heart Association class II or III heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction less than or equal to 45% who were treated for 3 months with benazepril hydrochloride, a new angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, while continuing treatment with diuretic agents and digoxin. Interobserver reproducibilities for ejection fraction (r = 0.94, SEE 3.3%), end-systolic volume (r = 0.98, SEE 10.6 ml), end-diastolic volume (r = 0.99, SEE 8.29 ml), end-systolic mass (r = 0.96, SEE 15.4 g), end-systolic wall stress (r = 0.91, SEE 10 dynes.s.cm-5) and end-systolic stress/volume ratio (r = 0.85, SEE 0.13) demonstrated applicability of cine NMR imaging for the serial assessment of cardiovascular function in response to pharmacologic interventions in patients with heart failure. During 12 weeks of treatment with benazepril, ejection fraction increased progressively from 29.7 +/- 2.2% (mean +/- SEM) to 36 +/- 2.2% (p less than 0.05), end-diastolic volume decreased from 166 +/- 14 to 158 +/- 12 ml (p = NS), end-systolic volume decreased from 118 +/- 12 to 106 +/- 11 ml (p less than 0.05), left ventricular mass decreased from 235 +/- 13 to 220 +/- 12 g (p less than 0.05), end-systolic wall stress decreased 29% from 90 +/- 5 to 64 +/- 5 dynes.s.cm-5 (p less than 0.05), end-systolic pressure decreased from 92.6 +/- 3.7 to 78.8 +/- 5.3 (p less than 0.05) and end-systolic stress/volume ratio, a load-independent index of contractility, decreased from 0.83 +/- 0.05 to 0.67 +/- 0.06 (p less than 0.05), demonstrating that improved ejection fraction is due to afterload reduction.", 
    "125": "Felodipine induces natriuresis, possibly by renal hemodynamic and/or tubular effects. Theoretically, reversal of the sodium-retaining effect of angiotensin II (Ang II) could be involved. Therefore, we administered felodipine during Ang II infusion and during suppression of endogenous Ang II production in two double-blind studies in healthy volunteers. First, a gradually increasing dose of Ang II was infused during felodipine or solvent infusion. Before starting Ang II, felodipine had lowered renal vascular resistance (RVR) and filtration fraction (FF), and simultaneously increased CNa. The Ang II induced rise of mean arterial pressure (MAP) and renal vasoconstriction was partly antagonized and the falls in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and CNa completely abolished by felodipine. The combination of felodipine and 3.0 ng/kg/min Ang II even enhanced natriuresis. Second, felodipine or solvent was infused after one week of pretreatment with placebo or the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor ramipril, which reduced MAP and induced renal vasodilatation. Ramipril pretreatment did not influence significantly the blood pressure reduction, renal vasodilatation, and natriuresis caused by felodipine. In conclusion, it seems unlikely that the natriuretic effect of felodipine is due to interference with renal effects of endogenous Ang II. The fact that felodipine reverses sodium retention on exogenous Ang II may be explained by interference with systemic and renal hemodynamic effects of exogenous Ang II.", 
    "126": "In congestive heart failure (CHF), excessive vasoconstriction is present, which is due to overactive vasoconstrictor mechanisms although vasodilator mechanisms may be impaired. In the present study, we examined vasodilation in CHF by measuring forearm blood flow with a strain gauge plethysmograph. Patients with CHF had higher forearm vascular resistance than normal control subjects. Patients with CHF had decreased forearm vasodilation in response to intra-arterial infusions of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and acetylcholine, but not in response to sodium nitroprusside or nitroglycerin. Oral captopril did not alter the degree of forearm vasodilation during handgrip exercise. These results suggest that endothelium-dependent and ANP-induced forearm vasodilation is impaired in patients with CHF but the decreased vasodilation is not due to impaired vascular smooth muscle responsiveness to a vasodilator. The renin-angiotensin system does not seem to play a major role in the maintenance of vascular resistance during exercise in CHF.", 
    "127": "Infarct expansion after myocardial infarction results in early ventricular enlargement and distortion of ventricular geometry. To characterize the components of late volume enlargement, biplane left ventriculography was performed in 52 patients 3 weeks and 1 year after a first anterior myocardial infarction. Biplane diastolic circumference and contractile and noncontractile segment lengths were measured. Global geometry was evaluated by using a sphericity index (angiographic volume of the ventricle divided by the volume of a sphere with the same circumference). Regional geometry was assessed by measurement of endocardial curvature, an important determinant of wall tension. End-diastolic volume was enlarged at baseline and increased at 1 year (230 +/- 42 to 244 +/- 55 ml, p = 0.01) as a result of increases in contractile segment length (34 +/- 5 to 37 +/- 5 cm, p less than 0.001) and sphericity index (0.74 +/- 0.07 to 0.76 +/- 0.08, p less than 0.001), whereas the noncontractile segment length decreased (15 +/- 6 to 12 +/- 6 cm, p less than 0.005). Curvature analysis revealed a flattening of presumably high tension concavity at the anterobasal (-6.0 +/- 4.0 to -4.5 +/- 3.7, p less than 0.01) and inferior (-4.5 +/- 2.0 to -3.6 +/- 2.1, p less than 0.005) margins of the infarct and less bulging of the anterior wall (9.4 +/- 2.5 to 8.2 +/- 2.3, p less than 0.001). Patients selected for late enlargement (diastolic volume increase greater than 20 ml, n = 19) had an increase in sphericity (0.75 +/- 0.05 to 0.80 +/- 0.08, p less than 0.005) and in diastolic circumference (54 +/- 3 to 56 +/- 4 cm, p less than 0.001) secondary to elongation of the contractile segment (32 +/- 4 to 36 +/- 4 cm, p = 0.001) at 1 year. Thus, late ventricular enlargement after anterior infarction results from an increase in contractile segment length and a change in ventricular geometry and is not a result of progressive infarct expansion. In the group of patients at high risk for late ventricular enlargement because of persistent occlusion of the infarct-related vessel, captopril therapy attenuated late volume enlargement by preventing these changes in contractile segment length and chamber geometry.", 
    "128": "Left ventricular remodeling describes a number of geometric and structural changes that the left ventricle undergoes after myocardial infarction. Briefly, it comprises expansion of the infarct and dilatation of the healthy left ventricular segments. Its severity is related to the infarct size. These changes in ventricular geometry, in particular the dilatation, influence the long-term incidence of cardiac failure, the main secondary complication of myocardial infarction. Up to now, therapeutic interventions have been oriented to reducing the infarct size with the aim of avoiding or delaying the occurrence of left ventricular dysfunction. Nowadays, it seems possible to influence the natural process of post-infarction. Left ventricular remodeling independently of efforts to reduce infarct size. There is evidence that this process may be limited pharmacologically with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. In animal studies, these agents limit remodeling and improve survival after myocardial infarction, but for the moment, despite confirmed benefits on left ventricular modeling, it is not possible to extrapolate these results in terms of clinical mortality.", 
    "129": "The influence of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory octapeptide derived from tuna muscle (tuna AI) on the bovine aorta endothelial cell (BAEC) migration was investigated, as compared with captopril. BAEC migration was quantitated 6 d after release from contact inhibition by a teflon fence assay. The culture grown in the presence of tuna AI (1 and 10 microM) clearly exhibited an increase in migration, compared with the control. The media collected from tuna AI (1 and 10 microM)-stimulated BAECs significantly exhibited the interleukin (IL) -1 activity that was detected by the thymocyte costimulation assay with phytohemagglutinin. Although tuna AI was a weaker ACE inhibitor than captopril, the increasing effect of tuna AI on the migration and the IL-1 generation in BAECs was slightly greater than that of captopril. In quiescent BAECs, tuna AI (1 microM) apparently induced c-myc and platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) A-chain messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expressions within 30 min, which persisted for 6 h. In contrast, captopril induced a very low expression of c-myc mRNA, and had no relation to PDGF A-chain mRNA expression. These results suggest that the increase of BAEC migration by tuna AI, unlike captopril, is likely related to the induction or activation of IL-1, and c-myc and PDGF mRNAs, in addition to the inhibition of the conversion of endogenous angiotensin I to angiotensin II.", 
    "130": "Fifteen normotensive athletes specializing in dynamic sports took part in a randomized double-blind and cross-over study: captopril (50 mg/24 h) vs placebo. Each treatment lasted one month. Maximal exercise tests on cycle ergometer were performed at the end of each period. No significant differences were observed in the maximal values of oxygen uptake, power, heart rate or blood lactate value. The anaerobic threshold, defined as the exercise intensity which corresponded to a 4 mmol.l-1 blood lactate level was unchanged. With captopril, the end-of-exercise systolic and diastolic BP were slightly altered (NS). Lower limb muscle strength, as explored with a Cybex isokinetic system, was not modified by captopril intake. The results indicate that maximal aerobic performance and isokinetic strength of the lower limbs are not altered by captopril chronic administration (50 mg/day) in normotensive trained subjects.", 
    "131": "1. The effect of enalapril on handling of an Na load and on body Na during 96 h of zero Na intake was measured in hypertensive rats (GH and SHR) and their normotensive controls (N and WKY) by a whole body counting method. 2. Enalapril treatment led to a greater fall in body Na in the first 24 h after the Na load (as expected from the known effect of ACE inhibition on aldosterone production) and thus to a slightly faster excretion of an amount equivalent to the load. 3. Enalapril-treated rats were unable to maintain body Na on a zero Na intake. This was also expected from the known effect on aldosterone production, though other mechanisms are not excluded. The effect was more marked in the SHR and WKY than in GH and N but there was no significant difference in this effect between the hypertensives and their respective control strains.", 
    "132": "1. The effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril on the responses of blood pressure and plasma catecholamine levels to the cold pressor test in human hypertensives were examined. 2. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased significantly after treatment with enalapril (5 mg/day for 4 weeks) as did the resting level of plasma noradrenaline. 3. The cold pressor test induced a rise in blood pressure and plasma noradrenaline levels. After 2 and 4 weeks enalapril treatment, the rises in the plasma noradrenaline level and systolic and diastolic pressure due to cold pressor test were reduced significantly. 4. These results suggest that ACE inhibition has a sympatho-inhibitory effect. One possible explanation is that enalapril reduces angiotensin II formation thus decreasing the activation of release-enhancing angiotensin II receptors on postganglionic sympathetic nerve endings.", 
    "133": "Five tetrahydroxyxanthones, 3,4,6,7-tetrahydroxyxanthone [1], 1,3,5,6-tetrahydroxyxanthone [2], 3,4,5,6-tetrahydroxyxanthone [3], 1,3,6,7-tetrahydroxyxanthone [4], and 2,3,6,7-tetrahydroxyxanthone [5] isolated from Tripterospermum lanceolatum inhibited angiotensin-I-converting-enzyme activity in a dose-dependent manner. The mode of inhibition of the tetrahydroxyxanthones (THXs) was found to be competitive inhibition. When the tetrahydroxy groups of THXs were blocked with acetyl groups, the angiotensin-I-converting-enzyme inhibitory activity was abolished, suggesting that the tetrahydroxy groups are indispensible for the inhibitory activity.", 
    "134": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are increasingly used to treat hypertension and congestive heart failure. Recently, several new ACE inhibitors with pharmacokinetic features different from earlier agents such as captopril or enalapril have come into use. This review discusses the use of pharmacokinetics to optimise ACE inhibitory therapy in various patient groups. Among the pharmacokinetic characteristics of ACE inhibitors the route of excretion and to a lesser degree the half-life appear to be the most clinically relevant. There is no evidence that being a prodrug offers a significant clinical advantage. The importance of varying tissue penetration also remains to be determined. Knowledge of ACE inhibitor pharmacokinetics is particularly important in patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction in whom the major route of excretion of these agents is impaired. This might also be the case in elderly patients or those with severe congestive heart failure. However, for most ACE inhibitors, major changes in the drug dosage (amount or interval) are necessary only when the glomerular filtration rate falls below 30 ml/min (1.80 L/h). The occurrence of adverse effects due to overdosage or drug interactions may be prevented by adapting the prescription of an ACE inhibitor to its pharmacokinetic characteristics.", 
    "135": "To test whether quinaprilat, a new angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, has any venous effect, its immediate effects were measured on mean circulatory filling pressure (MCFP), intravascular volume and total body vascular (i.e., venous) compliance in conscious rats with mild congestive heart failure induced by coronary artery ligation. MCFP was determined by inflating a right atrial balloon to arrest the circulation instantly and temporarily. Total body vascular compliance was derived from total circulatory pressure-volume relationships as determined by series measurements of MCFP with different intravascular volume status. In 8 rats with mean infarct size of 26 +/- 4%, 30-minute infusion of quinaprilat (0.1 mg/kg/min) decreased both mean arterial and central venous pressures by 8 mmHg and 0.7 mmHg, respectively (P less than 0.02); heart rate, MCFP, hematocrit and blood volume remained unchanged. Compared with control vehicle infusion, quinaprilat increased the total body vascular compliance (2.09 +/- 0.12 vs 2.69 +/- 0.23 ml/kg/mmHg; P less than 0.05) and decreased extrapolated unstressed circulating volume (34.96 +/- 1.10 vs 28.53 +/- 2.55 ml/kg; P less than 0.02). These data suggest that quinaprilat produces possible venodilation through immediately improved total body vascular compliance thereby reducing cardiac preload in this rat model of chronic heart failure.", 
    "136": "The hypothesis that antihypertensive drugs should be prescribed to elderly patients with isolated systolic hypertension is being addressed in at least 3 trials: the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP) in the United States, a trial in China, and the Syst-Eur study in Europe. The SHEP trial has recently reported its final morbidity and mortality results. This article summarizes the protocol of the European study. To be eligible for the Syst-Eur trial, patients must be at least 60 years old and have a systolic blood pressure averaging 160-219 mmHg with a diastolic pressure less than 95 mmHg. Patients must give their informed consent and be free of major cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular diseases at entry. The patients are randomized into active treatment or placebo. Active treatment consists of nitrendipine (10-40 mg/d), combined with enalapril (5-20 mg/d) and hydrochlorothiazide (12.5-25 mg/d), as necessary. The control group received matching placebos. The drugs (or matching placebos) are stepwise titrated and combined in order to reduce systolic blood pressure by 20 mmHg at least to a level below 150 mmHg. Morbidity and mortality are monitored to enable an intention-to-treat and per protocol comparison of the outcome in the two treatment groups.", 
    "137": "We studied the effect of captopril on exercise performance in 30 patients with congestive heart failure using a randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled method. 4-week captopril treatment can significantly increase the exercise tolerance time and work load, heart function, blood flow in exercising lower limbs as well as oxygen metabolic capacity. However, 3-day captopril treatment had no effect on exercise performance. A significant correlation was found between improvement in exercise performance and the pretreatment level of plasma angiotensin II. The increased levels of plasma prostaglandins E 2 and I 2 after captopril treatment were also correlated with improvement of exercise performance. The results indicated that long-term captopril treatment can increase exercise performance in congestive heart failure by improving both central and peripheral hemodynamics and metabolism. Certain vasomotor or endocrine factor may play a mediate role in the above changes.", 
    "138": "The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, abutapril (CGS 16617), was administered daily for 3 weeks to six different groups of rats at intervals of 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 or 120 min prior to a 40-min daily access to alcohol. Compared to a control group receiving the saline vehicle, abutapril (20 mg/kg) produced a significant and progressively increasing reduction in alcohol intake over the 3-week period of administration. In addition, intervals around the 60-min mark appeared to produce a more pronounced effect on alcohol intake such that a U-shaped function of interval emerged. These findings indicate that the interval between abutapril administration and alcohol consumption is an important variable in determining the ability of abutapril to reduce alcohol intake. Treatment of human alcohol misuse with ACE inhibitors might be more successful if done on a symptomatic basis.", 
    "139": "In this double blind randomised placebo controlled study, we investigated the antianginal efficacy of oral captopril in 33 patients of angiographically documented coronary artery disease (chronic stable angina). Apart from sublingual nitrates, all other antianginal drugs were withdrawn. Patients were then evaluated both subjectively by questionnaire and objectively by treadmill stress test. No patient had more than mild hypertension and all patients had good left ventricular function. One group of patients received oral captopril while the other group was given placebo. A repeat assessment was done after six weeks and the results compared with baseline. Anginal attacks decreased from 20.11 +/- 1.86 per week on placebo to 9.92 +/- 1.38 (p < 0.01) on captopril as also the number of sublingual nitrates (18.84 +/- 3.01 to 11.14 +/- 2.94, p < 0.01). Assessment by the treadmill stress test showed that in comparison to the pretreatment test, captopril therapy resulted in a significantly increased exercise duration (6.26 +/- 0.21 to 6.98 +/- 0.31 minutes, p < 0.05), total work done (6.76 +/- 0.26 METS to 7.48 +/- 0.29 METS, p < 0.05). In addition there was a significant increase in time to angina (6.16 +/- 0.18 to 6.85 +/- 0.24 min, p < 0.05) and time to 1mm ST depression (5.18 +/- 0.26 to 6.46 +/- 0.30 min, p < 0.01). We conclude that captopril is an effective monotherapy for patients with chronic stable angina and has both antianginal as well as anti-ischemic effects, possibly secondary to direct coronary vasodilation.", 
    "140": "Activation of the renin-angiotensin system induced by feeding a low NaCl, K-free (LS) diet is associated with polydipsia and a chronic reduction in effective plasma osmolality (efPosm). We have recently shown that converting enzyme inhibition with enalapril (EP) abolishes polydipsia. The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that the osmotic threshold for vasopressin is reset in rats fed the LS diet and to examine the effect of EP on ambient and osmotically stimulated plasma vasopressin levels (PAVP). Animals were fed the LS diet or a control salt diet and treated with vehicle or the lowest dose of EP sufficient to prevent polydipsia (7.5 mg.kg-1.day-1) in rats fed the LS diet. PAVP and efPosm were measured under ambient conditions and after osmotic loading. Urine osmolality (Uosm) was measured under ambient conditions and after water loading. The chronic reduction in efPosm in LS rats was associated with the excretion of a Uosm 1-2 times greater than the corresponding Posm, PAVP similar to controls (LS, 2.27 +/- 1.08 vs. control, 1.19 +/- 0.22 pg/mL) and the ability to excrete a water load. Following osmotic loading, efPosm and PAVP increased significantly and similarly in both LS and control rats. EP administration had no effect on water intake, ambient efPosm and PAVP, and the AVP response to osmotic loading in rats fed the control diet.

    "141": "Urinary excretion of albumin and beta 2-microglobulin were measured in 13 patients with congestive heart failure, NYHA class II-IV, before and after captopril treatment for 4 weeks, and in 13 healthy control subjects. The urinary excretion of albumin was enhanced in heart failure patients compared to control subjects (12.0 micrograms min-1 vs 2.8 micrograms min-1; medians, p less than 0.01), whereas beta 2-microglobulin excretion was normal. No significant change in urinary excretion of albumin was observed after captopril. Using Spearmann's test the urinary excretion of albumin was correlated to the NYHA class (Px = 0.681, p less than 0.05, plasma renin (Px = 0.886, p less than 0.01) and plasma angiotensin II (Px = 0.5840, p less than 0.05). Correlations with atrial natriuretic peptide (rho = 0.412, p = 0.153) and aldosterone (Px = 0.487, p = 0.106) did not reach significance. By multiple linear regression analysis only plasma renin activity was correlated to albumin excretion. In conclusion, patients with congestive heart failure had an increased urinary excretion of albumin. It is suggested that the enhanced transglomerular passage of albumin in congestive heart failure is partly due to an increased intra-renal angiotensin II generation, but elevated plasma level of atrial natriuretic peptide and increased renal venous pressure may also be important pathogenetic factors.", 
    "142": "Cardiac transplantation can be a highly successful therapeutic option for patients with end-stage congestive heart failure. Successful results, however, depend on the appropriate selection of patients for the procedure. Patients whose survival or quality of life would be compromised without cardiac transplantation and who are likely to benefit from this intensive type of treatment are potential candidates. Each patient should undergo a thorough assessment to identify any medical or psychologic contraindications to cardiac transplantation. In this review, we discuss the important predictors of survival in patients with congestive heart failure: the cause of heart failure, the patient's symptomatic and functional status, the hemodynamic and pathologic findings, the evaluation of neurohumoral activity, and the presence of cardiac arrhythmias. Once a patient with congestive heart failure has been identified as having a limited life expectancy and severely impaired quality of life, cardiac transplantation should be considered.",

The calcium antagonists Finoptin and Corinfar, as well as Capoten were equal in lowering blood pressure and having a heterodirectional action on cardiodynamics: Finoptin exerted a positive inotropic effect in 46.3% and a negative one in 53.7%, corinfar in 66.7 and 33.3%, respectively, and Capoten in 37.5 and 62.5%. The baseline hemodynamic type fails to predict how the myocardium in a particular patient will respond to the antihypertensive drug. Nevertheless, Corinfar is more preferable in patients with hypertensive disease attended by hypokinetic circulation, Capoten is more preferable in those with its hyperkinetic variant. The baseline hemodynamic type makes an insignificant contribution to the activity of Finoptin.",

    "152": "The persistent effects on blood pressure of the angiotensin II receptor antagonist losartan and the converting enzyme inhibitor captopril were compared in the young spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR). Losartan (DuP753/MK954, 15 mg/kg/day) and captopril (100 mg/kg/day) were given in the drinking water of 3-week-old SHRs for 4- and 10-week durations. Blood pressure was measured during treatment and after treatment was stopped until the age of 30 weeks. Both losartan and captopril given for 4 and 10 weeks prevented the development of hypertension during treatment and redevelopment of hypertension after treatment was stopped. Treatment for 10 weeks was more effective than for 4 weeks in lowering long-term pressure. Four weeks of treatment did not affect the mesenteric resistance artery media/lumen (m1/l1) ratio. In contrast, both losartan and captopril given for 10 weeks resulted in large and significant reductions in m1/l1 [5.3 +/- 0.8 and 5.63 +/- 0.8 vs 7.7 +/- 0.8 x 10(-2) (SD), p less than 0.001]. In losartan-treated rats, plasma renin and angiotensin II concentration were increased between 4- and 7-fold at the end of both treatment periods. These findings show losartan to be an effective antihypertensive agent and support data implicating angiotensin II in the early events leading to hypertension in this model. The abilities of losartan and captopril to affect blood pressure without affecting vascular structure suggest that the latter is a poor predictor of long-term hypertensive levels in the SHR.", 
    "153": "Previous studies on the possible antiarrhythmic effects of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors during early ischemia in pigs have been inconclusive or negative; however, proof of adequate ACE inhibition was not provided. Perindoprilat, 0.06 mg/kg, i.v., was administered 30 min prior to ligation of the anterior descending coronary artery (CAL) in anesthetised open-chest pigs. Plasma ACE activity was decreased by 95.0 +/- 1.9% when measured 5 min before CAL. Within 5 min of CAL, the ventricular fibrillation threshold (VFT) in the control group was decreased from 11.8 +/- 1.9 to 7.2 +/- 1.2 mA (p less than 0.01). Perindoprilat prevented the fall in the VFT and the increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure caused by CAL. Perindoprilat decreased arterial pressure. Cardiac output (thermodilution) was decreased by 23 +/- 3% after CAL in the control group and by only 10 +/- 5% (p less than 0.05) in the perindoprilat group (both versus pre-CAL values). In the control group cyclic AMP was increased from 0.97 +/- 0.04 (pre-CAL) to 1.16 +/- 0.04 nmol/g (p less than 0.05) in the central ischemic zone 20 min after CAL. Perindoprilat prevented this increase in cyclic AMP. Twenty minutes after CAL blood flow (microsphere method) in the nonischemic zone of the perindoprilat group was increased, whereas blood flow in the central ischemic zone was decreased compared to the control group. However, levels of tissue metabolites (ATP, phosphocreatine, lactate) measured in drill biopsies in the same zones of the two groups were similar.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "154": "In this study the effect of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril on beta-receptor responsiveness was investigated in failing rat hearts after experimental myocardial infarction. Infarcted rats were treated for 8 weeks with either captopril added to the drinking water (100 mg/kg/day; n = 5) or drinking water alone (n = 7). Treatment was started 2-3 days before myocardial infarction. A third group of untreated rats without myocardial infarction served as control (n = 6). At the end of the treatment period the hearts were perfused as described by Langendorff, and a cumulative dose-response curve of isoprenaline was obtained in each heart. In comparison with noninfarcted hearts, the response of heart rate and peak pressure rate (dP/dt) to isoprenaline stimulation was significantly depressed in hearts of infarcted rats. Chronic treatment with captopril significantly attenuated the reduced responsiveness to isoprenaline stimulation. This improved responsiveness in captopril-treated rat hearts might be due to prevention of \"down-regulation\" of myocardial beta-adrenoceptors. Other factors should also be considered, such as prevention of structural alterations in the noninfarcted myocardium, e.g., myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis. Differences in infarct size did not play an important role, since infarct size was comparable in both groups of infarcted rats. This partial preservation of beta-adrenergic responsiveness was accompanied by a significant reduction in right ventricular weight and lung weight, suggesting that captopril also improved the signs of heart failure. Therefore, the results of this study indicate that early ACE inhibition in myocardial infarction may be useful in preventing deterioration of cardiac function.", 
    "155": "In this randomized, blinded study the effect of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril on electrical stability after myocardial infarction in pigs was compared to placebo. The left anterior descending artery was occluded for 45 min. Perindoprilat (0.06 mg/kg, n = 12) or saline (n = 12) was injected 15 min before reperfusion. Treatment was continued till day 13 with perindopril (12 mg, once daily) or placebo. At day 14 an electrophysiologic study was performed. The release of creatine phosphokinase did not differ significantly. During the subsequent days, seven of 12 placebo-treated pigs died (six within 24 h), whereas two of the 12 perindopril-treated pigs died (one within 24 h; p less than 0.04). Sustained ventricular tachycardia was inducible in one of five placebo-treated pigs versus three of 10 perindopril-treated survivors (NS). Late potentials had developed in one placebo-treated pig but not in pigs that received perindopril. Characteristics of infarct border zone heterogeneity (percentages of a reference electrode in viable myocardium) such as a dispersion of current thresholds (127 +/- 96 vs. 238 +/- 463% in perindopril-treated pigs, NS) and refractoriness (9.8 +/- 8.4 vs. 11.9 +/- 6.0% in perindopril-treated pigs, NS) were comparable. This treatment with perindopril significantly improved survival while electrical stability was comparable between survivors. The latter indicates that a comparable electrical stability 2 weeks after myocardial infarction is obtained in perindopril-treated pigs at a significantly higher survival rate.", 
    "156": "Prostaglandins (PG) have been suggested to play a role in the genesis of cough induced by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) and that inhibition of PG synthesis can reduce or abolish the incidence of this side effect. Moreover, experimental and clinical data suggest that nifedipine, a dihydropyridine Ca antagonist, can inhibit PG synthesis. Therefore, we wished to determine whether nifedipine can reduce cough induced by ACE-I as compared with indomethacin, a known inhibitor of PG synthesis. Fourteen hypertensive patients who developed cough during captopril chronic therapy randomly received slow-release nifedipine 20 mg twice daily (b.i.d.), indomethacin 50 mg b.i.d., and placebo b.i.d. for 1 week in a double-blind, cross-over design. At the end of each treatment phase, cough was evaluated by a self-administered questionnaire containing an ordinal scale for daily cough intensity and frequency. Indomethacin abolished or markedly reduced cough induced by ACE-I, whereas nifedipine reduced it but to a lesser degree. These findings suggest that PG can play a role in cough caused by ACE-I, and a dihydropyridine Ca antagonist can reduce the occurrence of this side effect.", 
    "157": "FK506, a newly developed immunosuppressive agent, has recently been used for human liver and kidney transplantation. The present study was carried out to assess the functional and morphological changes by acute or chronic administration of FK506 in heminephrectomized rats. FK506 was given intravenously at the dose of 0.384 mg/kg/hr for 90 min in acute experiment. FK506 was administered by gastric gavage at doses of 1, 2.5, 5 mg/kg for 21 days. Blood and urinary biochemistry were monitored every week. Inulin and PAH clearance studies were conducted during the infusion of FK506 for acute study, and at day 21 for chronic study. Some of the rats were treated with diltiazem (Dilt), captopril or prazosine for 21 days to prevent FK506 nephrotoxicity. Acute infusion of FK506 did not change renal and systemic hemodynamics. Creatinine clearance showed a dose dependent decrease by 10-20% in the rats with chronic administration of FK506. Inulin/PAH clearance indicated a decrease in glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow with an increase in renal vascular resistance. The renal histology showed vacuolization in proximal tubuli and media of smooth muscle cells of arterioles. The administration of Dilt functionally and morphologically improved renal impairment induced by FK506. In conclusion, FK506 induces a dose dependent decrease in renal function with significant histological changes in tubuli and arterioles in rat kidney. Intracellular calcium deregulation seems to be involved in FK506-induced nephrotoxicity.", 
    "158": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and digoxin may be used in the management of heart failure. Digoxin increases myocardial contractility in vitro, and has a modest but durable beneficial effect in congestive heart failure due to impaired left ventricular systolic function. ACE inhibitors have clear beneficial effects in all grades of heart failure and, in addition, modify the natural history and reduce mortality. Comparative studies in mild to moderate heart failure reveal a tendency towards greater benefits and tolerability of ACE inhibitors over digoxin. ACE inhibition is indicated, in conjunction with diuretic therapy, for all grades of heart failure. Digoxin is best reserved for patients with atrial fibrillation and a rapid ventricular response, and for those whose heart failure is not controlled with an ACE inhibitor plus a diuretic. In patients with heart failure following myocardial infarction, digoxin is of modest benefit. Digoxin should be administered slowly and carefully to avoid acute vasoconstriction and toxicity. Provisional data suggest ACE inhibitors are also beneficial in these patients. However, the results of clinical trials presently in progress are required to clarify their role following myocardial infarction.",

    "160": "The physicochemical properties, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, cardiovascular and metabolic effects, adverse effects, dosage, and administration of doxazosin are described, and comparative clinical studies of doxazosin therapy in patients with mild to moderate hypertension are reviewed. Doxazosin mesylate, an alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, is rapidly absorbed after oral administration and undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism. The drug decreases blood pressure by reducing peripheral resistance. Maximum hypotensive effects occur four to eight hours after the dose. Doxazosin favorably affects serum lipids by increasing concentrations of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, increasing the HDL:total cholesterol ratio, and decreasing concentrations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, and triglycerides. In comparative clinical trials, doxazosin lowered standing and supine systolic and diastolic blood pressures as effectively as other alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists, beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, diuretics, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, and calcium-channel-blocking agents. The most frequently reported adverse effects are dizziness, headache, nausea, lethargy, and fatigue. Doxazosin may be used either alone or in combination with a beta-adrenoceptor inhibitor or a diuretic. Orthostatic hypotension after the first dose occurs infrequently and may be minimized by initiating therapy at a dosage of 1 mg/day. The dosage may be increased at two-week intervals as needed, and blood pressure should be closely monitored. Doxazosin has blood-pressure-lowering effects comparable to those of other alpha 1-adrenoceptor inhibitors and to those of antihypertensives in other drug classes.", 
    "161": "Choosing antihypertensive agents that protect patients against cardiovascular and other complications is a growing trend in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension. Calcium channel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are favored because they have neutral or positive effects on lipid levels and insulin resistance. The alpha 1 blockers, especially doxazosin mesylate (Cardura), are enjoying a resurgence in popularity because they have a beneficial effect on lipid levels. In terms of preserving patients' quality of life, the ACE inhibitors in particular have been shown to have a positive impact. It has been shown that systolic hypertension in elderly patients should definitely be treated, but the most appropriate agent has yet to be defined. Therapy should be tailored to the individual. The following questions should be considered when choosing an antihypertensive agent: (1) What are its side effects (especially metabolic ones)? (2) Does it require only once- or twice-a-day dosing? (3) Does it cause regression of left ventricular hypertrophy? (4) Does it prevent death from coronary artery disease? (5) How will it affect quality of life? (6) How much does it cost? The goal of therapy should be to provide adequate blood pressure control throughout the day, enhance compliance, and protect the heart, brain, and kidneys without adversely affecting metabolic state.", 
    "162": "Plasma levels of endothelin (ET), plasma renin activity (PRA) and angiotensin II (Ang II) were measured in anaesthetized marmosets exposed to acute aortic stenosis proximal to the renal arteries. In vehicle experiments, ET rose from 5 +/- 2 to 38 +/- 4 pg ml-1, PRA from 5 +/- 2 to 99 +/- 21 ng ml-1 h-1 and Ang II from 21 +/- 4 to 213 +/- 76 pg ml-1. Administration of renin inhibitor and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor reduced PRA and Ang II to control levels, while the plasma levels of ET increased further (51 +/- 10 and 71 +/- 16 pg ml-1, respectively). During aortic stenosis the two isoforms ET-1 and ET-3 appeared in the circulation, while in conscious control animals only ET-1 was found. It is concluded that the increased plasma levels of ET in our primate model could not be ascribed to the increased circulating levels of PRA and Ang II.", 
    "163": "Eye-ground-photos were taken in twenty-eight previously untreated men with mild to moderate essential hypertension. The same eye was evaluated before and after 26 weeks of double-blind treatment with Enalapril or Hydrochlorothiazide. The vascular changes were assessed by using a more elaborate and refined grading than the Keith-Wagener-Barker scale. All photos were examined by the same observer without knowledge of blood pressure, type of treatment or the order in which the photos had been taken. There were significant positive correlations between the vascular alterations in the retina in the untreated state and left ventricular wall thickness (echocardiography), minimal vascular resistance in the calf (plethysmography) and blood pressure respectively. Treatment with Enalapril decreased the reflection of the retinal arterial wall significantly and reduced the narrowing of arteries and arterio-venous crossing phenomena non-significantly. Hydrochlorothiazide did not affect any of the retinal vascular changes. It can be concluded that this relatively simple technique of evaluating eye-ground-photos with a new grading scale, when used in non-malignant hypertension, gives a useful assessment of the degree of hypertensive target organ damage in the retina as well as in other important target organs, i.e. the heart and vascular beds. In addition, Enalapril positively affects hypertensive retinopathy in contrast to Hydrochlorothiazide, reflecting what happens to structural cardiovascular changes in the rest of the body.", 
    "164": "The actions of angiotensin II can be described in terms of the three paradigms listed in Table 1. According to the first paradigm (organ physiology), angiotensin II is a pressor, while the second (cell biochemistry) views it as an extracellular messenger that, by promoting Ca2+ release within cells, causes vasoconstriction and a weak positive inotropic response by the heart. However, neither of these paradigms fully explains the remarkable ability of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors to improve the prognosis for patients with heart failure. To account for these clinical effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, we will probably need to invoke the third paradigm (gene expression), which views angiotensin II as a growth factor that promotes and modifies protein synthesis. Angiotensin II, therefore, should probably not be viewed simply as a vasoconstrictor with a side effect to promote hypertrophy, but instead as a growth factor that, because it utilizes Ca2+ to mediate its effects on gene expression, also increases smooth muscle tone and myocardial contractility. This view of angiotensin II as a growth factor helps us to understand the clinical benefit of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors as arising from inhibition of maladaptive changes in the failing heart (gene expression) as well as from the reduced afterload (organ physiology) that results from decreased smooth muscle tone (cell biochemistry).",

ACE from rat lung and testis was characterized by radioligand binding studies using [125I]-Ro 31-8472, the radioiodinated hydroxy derivative of the potent ACE inhibitor cilazaprilat. 2. Analysis of the displacement of [125I]-Ro 31-8472 from ACE by ACE inhibitors of different structure by the LIGAND program was best fitted by a two binding site model for lung ACE and a one binding site model for testis ACE. 3. There was marked variation in ACE inhibitor binding affinity at the two binding sites of lung ACE across the panel of ACE inhibitors studied (equilibrium dissociation constant; Kd; pmol/L) for site one vs site two: cilazaprilat 40 +/- 3 vs 430 +/- 92*; lisinopril 25 +/- 1 vs 848 +/- 107**; and quinaprilat 4 +/- 1 vs 1869 +/- 720; *P less than 0.05; **P less than 0.005, t-test, n = 3). Reduction in binding affinity at site two of lung ACE was related to an increase in ACE inhibitor side chain length or complexity of carboxyl terminal moiety. ACE inhibitor binding affinity at the testis ACE binding site resembled site one of lung ACE. 4. Inhibition of bradykinin hydrolysis by lung ACE in the presence of increasing concentrations of cilazaprilat or quinaprilat was similar (F = 0.64; P greater than 0.05), suggesting that bradykinin cleavage predominates at ACE active site one. 5.

The rate constants for reactions of those compounds with .OH were determined using the deoxyribose method. All there compounds proved to be good scavengers of .OH with rate constants of about 10(10)M-1s-1 and are iron chelators specially enalapril.

In previous studies relatively high doses of captopril (25-400 mg daily) were unsuccessful in promoting diuresis and natriuresis in these patients. We analyzed the efficacy of a low dose of captopril in eight patients with massive ascites resistant to therapy of salt/fluid restriction and increasing doses of spironolactone and furosemide. Mean duration of diuretic use was 73 days (range 7-240 days). After at least 3 days of observation on 80 mg furosemide and 100 mg spironolactone only, captopril was added. Four out of eight patients responded with an increase in natriuresis and diuresis; daily dose of captopril was 20.6 mg in responders and 26.5 mg in non-responders. After the addition of captopril the mean weight change was -7.5 kg in responders and +0.25 kg in non-responders. Mean urinary sodium output in responders increased from 72.8 (S.D. = 35.2) to 128.5 (63.5) mmol within 10 days. Increased diuresis in responders made diuretic reduction necessary: mean furosemide from 80 to 53.3 mg, and mean spironolactone from 100 to 68.1 mg. Creatinine clearances remained stable. High levels of plasma renin activity, plasma aldosterone and angiotensin-II were found in all patients. Non-responders showed more severe hyponatremia and higher vasopressin levels. Natriuretic atrial factor (NAF) was in the upper-normal range or slightly elevated in both groups. In non-responders we noticed low levels of cGMP in 24-h urine, compared with responders.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "179": "The involvement of the circulating and local renin-angiotensin system in atherosclerotic process has been hypothesized on the basis of experimental data showing presence and specific actions of the components of this system in the vascular wall. In particular, angiotensin II may participate in well known events in atherogenesis as the control of smooth muscle cell growth and proliferation. Recent studies have shown an effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition on the development of atherosclerosis in animal models. Captopril and cilazapril prevent myointimal proliferation after vascular injury in rat. Captopril reduces aortic cholesterol content and percentage intimal aortic surface covered by lesions in Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic rabbits. Captopril also significantly reduces the progression of carotid and coronary lesions in monkeys fed a high cholesterol diet. In addition, a role for converting enzyme inhibitors in reducing aortic and microvascular growth either in hypertensive or normotensive rats has been demonstrated. It is possible that ACE-inhibitors prevent angiotensin II-induced vascular proliferation and thereby suppress the development of atherosclerosis in animals. It is also conceivable that the blood pressure effects of ACE-inhibitors could play a role in the antiatherosclerotic effect shown by these drugs, even though this explanation cannot be addressed by studies dealing with normotensive animals. Then, other mechanisms could be involved, including hypothesized effects of blockade of the renin-angiotensin system on sympathetic nervous system activity, regulation of vascular growth factors and insulin sensitivity. The clinical significance of these experimental findings is unknown.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Human PMNs were isolated and exposed for 30 min to either saline or one of three different pharmacologic agents, each tested at three different concentrations: Group 1, saline (control, n = 14); Groups 2-4, heparin (5000 units, n = 8; 2500 units, n = 6; 1250 units, n = 6) respectively; Groups 5-7, dexamethasone (4 mg, n = 8; 2 mg, n = 6; 1 mg, n = 6), respectively; and Groups 8-10, enalapril (1.25 mg, n = 8; 0.62 mg, n = 6; 0.31 mg, n = 6). Superoxide anion production was measured by the reduction of cytochrome c in a spectrophotometric assay. Chemotaxis was evaluated by the number of PMNs migrating across a filter using a Neuro Probe chamber. Phagocytosis was determined by the ingestion of opsonized zymosan particles by PMNs. Serum obtained from each PMN donor was used both to opsonize the zymosan and as a chemoattractant in the chemotaxis assay. No agent, at any dose, significantly changed superoxide production when compared to control cells. All three agents significantly inhibited PMN chemotaxis at every dose tested (P less than 0.01). In the phagocytosis assay, both heparin (at high and intermediate doses) and enalapril (at all doses) significantly reduced phagocytic activity (P less than 0.01); however, dexamethasone (at high and intermediate doses) produced a marked stimulation (P less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Previous studies designed to identify the mechanisms involved in this response have yielded conflicting results. We noted certain similarities between the pharmacology of MBS-induced airway responses and those elicited by bradykinin (BK), another provocating agent in asthmatic subjects. Therefore we used allergic sheep to determine whether MBS-induced bronchoconstriction 1) had a pharmacology similar to that previously seen with BK in this model, including protection by a BK B2-receptor antagonist, NPC-567, and 2) was associated with increased concentrations of immunoreactive kinins in bronchoalveolar lavage. We measured specific lung resistance before and immediately after inhaled buffer and increasing concentrations of MBS (30 breaths of 25, 50, and 100 mg/ml) and calculated the concentration producing 100% increase in specific lung resistance over baseline (PC100). In seven sheep, geometric mean control PC100 was 33.1 mg/ml. Pretreatment with either the anticholinergic agent ipratropium bromide (180 micrograms; PC100 87.1 mg/ml) or the antiasthma drug nedocromil sodium (1 mg/kg aerosol; PC100 97.7 mg/ml) blocked the MBS-induced bronchoconstriction (P less than 0.05), whereas the histamine H1-receptor antagonist chlorpheniramine (2 mg/kg iv) was ineffective. Furthermore the MBS-induced bronchoconstriction was not affected by the neutral endopeptidase inhibitor thiorphan (40 breaths of a 1 mg/ml solution) or the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalaprilat (2.5 mg aerosol). In six sheep the MBS-induced bronchoconstriction was completely blocked by NPC-567 (20 breaths, 5 mg/ml aerosol): after treatment with NPC-567 mean PC100 was 100 mg/ml compared with 57.5 mg/ml in the control trial (P less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Left ventricular (LV) mass was already significantly reduced after 16 weeks of treatment (p less than 0.001) and remained decreased thereafter, with no difference in the response to the 2 treatment regimens. The change in LV mass was related to the decrease in systolic BP for the total study group (p less than 0.001) and for each treatment group separately. During the 3-week run-out period on placebo, BP and LV mass increased again (p less than 0.01). Afterload decreased during active treatment (p less than 0.001), and fractional shortening of the LV internal diameter was significantly increased (p less than 0.01) to a similar extent in both groups. The ratio of peak mitral flow velocities during atrial contraction and early filling was reduced after 1 year of active treatment in the total study group (p less than 0.01); this change was similar in both groups.

In contrast, BK agonist analogs were hydrolyzed more slowly due to selective resistance to these plasma peptidases. In addition to Lys-Lys-BK (B1087), which is partially resistant to ACE, [Hyp3,Phe8-r-Arg9]BK (B7642) was completely resistant to ACE, CPN, and the unidentified plasma activity (1.9 +/- 0.3 nmol/min/ml), and D-Arg0[Hyp3,Phe8-r-Arg9]BK (B7644) was resistant to all plasma hydrolysis, including APP (less than 0.2 nmol/min/ml). In vivo ACE-resistant B1087 exhibited a depressor potency and duration of action greater than BK and equivalent to that of BK in the presence of the ACE inhibitor enalapril. Although the B7642 and B7644 agonists were also more potent and longer acting than BK, the increases were no more than that seen for B1087, despite their additional resistance to CPN (B7642) and CPN and APP (B7644). The duration of action of these analogs was, however, increased after renal ligation. These data demonstrate the importance of ACE to the metabolism of circulating BK and BK analogs. In contrast, resistance to CPN and APP are not associated with further potentiation. Beyond ACE resistance, it is likely that the development of more potent, longer-acting BK agonists and antagonists will relate to other factors, such as renal processing independent of CPN and APP.",

    "202": "Hearts with compensatory pressure-overload hypertrophy show an increased intracardiac activation of angiotensin II that may contribute to ischemic diastolic dysfunction. We studied whether pressure-overload hypertrophy in response to aortic banding would result in exaggerated diastolic dysfunction during low-flow ischemia and whether the specific inhibition of the cardiac angiotensin converting enzyme by enalaprilat would modify systolic and diastolic function during ischemia and reperfusion in either hypertrophied or nonhypertrophied hearts. Isolated, red blood cell-perfused isovolumic nonhypertrophied and hypertrophied rat hearts were subjected to enalaprilat (2.5 x 10(-7) M final concentration) infusion during 20 minutes of baseline perfusion and during 30 minutes of low-flow ischemia and 30 minutes of reperfusion. Coronary flow per gram was similar in nonhypertrophied and hypertrophied hearts during baseline perfusion, ischemia, and reperfusion. At baseline, left ventricular developed pressure was higher in hypertrophied than nonhypertrophied hearts in untreated groups (224 +/- 8 versus 150 +/- 9 mm Hg; p less than 0.01) and in enalaprilat-treated groups (223 +/- 9 versus 145 +/- 8 mm Hg; p less than 0.01). During low-flow ischemia, left ventricular developed pressure was depressed but similar in all groups. All groups showed deterioration of diastolic function; however, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure increased to a significantly higher level in untreated hypertrophied than in nonhypertrophied hearts (65 +/- 7 versus 33 +/- 3 mm Hg; p less than 0.001). Enalaprilat had no effect in nonhypertrophied hearts, but it significantly attenuated the greater increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure in hypertrophied hearts treated with enalaprilat compared with no drug (65 +/- 7 versus 50 +/- 5 mm Hg; p less than 0.01). The beneficial effect could not be explained by differences in coronary blood flow per gram left ventricular weight, glycolytic flux as reported by lactate production, myocardial water content, oxygen consumption, and tissue levels of glycogen and high energy phosphate compounds. During reperfusion, all hearts showed a partial recovery of developed pressure to 70-74% of initial values. No effect of enalaprilat could be detected during reperfusion on systolic and diastolic function or restoration of tissue levels of high energy compounds. In conclusion, our experiments show that hypertrophied red blood cell-perfused hearts manifest a severe impairment of left ventricular diastolic relaxation in response to low-flow ischemia in comparison with control hearts. Further, our experiments support the hypothesis that the enhanced conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II in rats with pressure-overload hypertrophy contributes to the enhanced sensitivity of hypertrophied hearts to diastolic dysfunction during low-flow ischemia.", 
    "203": "Age-related changes (e.g., decrease in plasma renin activity and total body potassium, increase in plasma catecholamines, volume depletion) need to be taken into account when selecting an antihypertensive agent for the elderly patient. A number of large scale clinical trials (e.g., Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program, Veterans Administration Cooperative Study, European Working Party on High Blood Pressure in the Elderly) have demonstrated that antihypertensive therapy with diuretics substantially reduced cardiovascular mortality and stroke incidence. However, since diuretics, even potassium-sparing agents, may induce hypokalemia, newer antihypertensive agents (angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors and calcium antagonists) may also be appropriate as first-line monotherapy for this patient population. ACE inhibitors are effective antihypertensive agents and are associated with a lower rate of adverse effects than diuretics, beta blockers, and centrally acting agents. Nevertheless, periodic monitoring of serum potassium, creatinine levels, and renal function is advisable. An important feature of calcium antagonists is that they lower blood pressure with no negative effect on serum lipids or glucose metabolism. Typically, they have few side effects, peripheral edema being the most commonly reported. A recent double-blind randomized study comparing a new sustained release nifedipine formulation and the ACE inhibitor lisinopril found the 2 drugs equivalent in efficacy with no differences in the rate of adverse events.", 
    "204": "Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, including coronary artery disease (CAD), stroke, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, renal failure, and aortic aneurysms. It is also a potent promoter of atherosclerosis. Observational studies have shown a linear relationship between a wide range of blood pressures and the risk for CAD and stroke. Clinical trials have indicated that hypertension reduction leads to the predicted reduction in stroke incidence, but that CAD incidence is affected to a lesser extent than predicted. The modest effect of traditional antihypertensive drugs on CAD may be due to several factors, including failure to reverse well-established coronary atherosclerosis, particularly if multiple risk factors are not reduced as well. Metabolic side effects of antihypertensive drugs or excessive lowering of blood pressure leading to inadequate myocardial perfusion, especially in patients with increased left ventricular (LV) mass, also may play important roles. Hypertension is a major cause of renal failure, particularly in black males, but control of the hypertension does not necessarily prevent deterioration of renal function. Increased glomerular pressure is thought to play a causative role in the development of renal failure in hypertensive and diabetic patients. Antihypertensive drugs may have a direct effect on the arterial wall, which may be independent of their antihypertensive action. Beta-adrenergic blockers, calcium antagonists, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors inhibit the development of vascular lesions in response to hypercholesterolemia or to iatrogenic balloon injury, but the clinical importance of these observations remains to be determined.",

Of these, 460 patients have completed the 6-week double-blind phase (comprising two assessments, at 3 and 6 weeks), and are currently undergoing assessments every 3 months over a 1-year follow-up period. The end points include the incidence of progression or improvement in concomitant disease, the incidence of positive or negative interaction between ACE inhibition and concomitant therapy, change in blood pressure, adverse biochemical and hemodynamic reactions, self-reported side effects, and quality of life indices. Interim results for the 6-week double blind phase will shortly be available.

In a subgroup of 38 patients a complete echocardiographic study was performed. The two groups had similar (ANOVA) blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), body mass index, and duration of hypertension. Supine and standing BP was significantly reduced by both drugs, without differences between them.

Patients were assessed at 2 weekly intervals for the first month and then monthly for 2 more months. If supine DBP was greater than 90 mm Hg, treatment was increased by stepwise doubling of dose up to 8 mg perindopril or 100 mg atenolol once daily, and later by the addition of hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg, (indapamide 2.5 mg in diabetic patients) once daily. The two groups were homogeneous prior to treatment except for supine and erect heart rate, which were higher in the perindopril group than in the atenolol group (p less than 0.05). Mean supine DBP was 101.1 +/- 0.6 mm Hg in the perindopril group (n = 94) and 99.9 +/- 0.6 mm Hg in the atenolol group (n = 96). After 3 months' active treatment, 74% of patients in the perindopril group achieved a supine DBP of less than or equal to 90 mm Hg and 73% of patients in the atenolol group achieved the same goal. Monotherapy controlled supine DBP in 67% of the perindopril group and 63% of the atenolol group. The decrease in supine DBP was not significantly different between the two groups (-12.9 +/- 0.9 versus -14.7 +/- 0.9 mm Hg) but the decrease in erect DBP was lower in the perindopril group (-10.3 +/- 0.9 versus - 13.4 +/- 1.0 mm Hg, p less than 0.02). Heart rate was reduced in the atenolol group (p less than 0.001). Sixteen patients withdrew from the study; nine were attributed to adverse events, two in the perindopril group and seven, including one death, in the atenolol group. Cough was spontaneously reported by 13% patients of the perindopril group and 1% patients of the atenolol group. In 5% of the perindopril cases this was mild and associated with upper respiratory tract infection. The nature and incidence of other symptoms were similar with both drugs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "211": "About 40% of patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes (NIDDM) have hypertension, which in turn may contribute to their enhanced risk for cardiovascular diseases. However, a number of antihypertensive agents tend to cause a deterioration in the control of diabetes. The present study was designed to elucidate whether treatment with perindopril (a new angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitor) affects plasma lipid metabolism, glucose homeostasis, and insulin sensitivity. Ten patients with NIDDM and moderate hypertension were studied in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study encompassing 6 weeks of placebo treatment and 6 weeks of perindopril treatment given in random order. Mean systolic/diastolic blood pressure was 162/94 +/- 6/3 mm Hg during placebo treatment versus 157/91 +/- 5/2 mm Hg during perindopril therapy. Plasma levels of free fatty acids, triglycerides, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and total cholesterol were similar during placebo and perindopril treatment. Oral glucose tolerance tests showed similar responses of plasma glucose, serum insulin, and serum C peptide following placebo and perindopril treatment. Insulin sensitivity estimated with an intravenous insulin tolerance test (IVITT) was unchanged by perindopril therapy (KIVITT: 0.014 +/- 0.001 min-1 [placebo] versus 0.015 +/- 0.003 min-1 [perindopril], difference not significant. In conclusion, treatment with perindopril in NIDDM patients had no adverse effects on plasma lipids, glucose tolerance, or insulin sensitivity.", 
    "212": "The excretions of urinary sodium, potassium, magnesium, urate, and water after dosing with diuretics or the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril are reported, as well as the results of other recent studies. Perindopril in low dose had no significant effect on any of these 24-hour urinary excretions and in high dose, in contrast to captopril and enalapril, does not increase magnesium loss. These effects were studied in healthy volunteers, which may not reflect urinary excretions in hypertensive patients.", 
    "213": "Aging in rats with intact kidneys is associated with changes in selective glomerular permeability to macromolecules resulting in proteinuria and progressive glomerular sclerosis. We have previously reported that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition in Munich Wistar Fromter/Ztm (MWF/Ztm) rats resulted in a significant reduction of proteinuria, in respect to untreated animals, and that treated animals were protected against the development of glomerular sclerotic lesions. The present study was designed to establish whether ACE inhibition protects against glomerular injury in male Sprague-Dawley rats, which develop spontaneous proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis with age. The effect of ACE inhibition was tested when proteinuria was already present. Four-month treatment with the ACE inhibitor perindopril prevented the increase in systolic blood pressure, compared with vehicle-treated animals, and significantly decreased urinary protein excretion of aging rats. Partial protection of the development of glomerular sclerosis was also observed.", 
    "214": "Large artery dilation is produced by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition in hypertensive subjects despite a significant blood pressure reduction. The resulting increase in arterial compliance may be due both to blood pressure decrease and to arterial smooth muscle relaxation. In healthy volunteers and in hypertensive subjects, dosages causing large artery dilation seem to be higher than those causing pure arteriolar dilation with resulting blood pressure reduction. Similar findings have been noted to obtain compliance enhancement. Such results may be important in considering antihypertensive therapy, particularly when remodeling of the cardiovascular system is considered in long-term treatment.", 
    "215": "A model of arterial graft arteriosclerosis is described in which arterial wall immune injury was induced by grafting segments of abdominal aorta between two histologically incompatible strains of rats. The effect of hypertension and its treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor perindopril was tested using inbred spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and their normotensive controls (Wistar-Kyoto [WKY]). Each of the grafted hypertensive and normotensive rats was randomly allocated to placebo treatment (10 SHR, 10 WKY) and perindopril treatment (2 mg/kg/day) (10 SHR, 10 WKY). The immune injury and the arterial wall response were quantified morphometrically 2 months after the grafting using specific stains for collagen, elastin, and nuclei. Hypertension was associated with a significant increase in intimal thickness. Treatment with perindopril greatly reduced intimal proliferation, decreasing the intimal thickness and the collagen content within the intimal layer. In contrast, hypertension and ACE inhibition had little effect on the arterial wall injury. We conclude that hypertension and its treatment with perindopril significantly affect graft arteriosclerosis. These effects seem to be independent of their effects on arterial wall injury, but not independent of blood pressure.", 
    "216": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are effective hypotensive agents in hypertension of different types and degree. Probably, they lower pressure by reducing angiotensin II (AII); the varied timing of their hypotensive effect suggests that AII increases blood pressure in more than one way. Infusion studies show two effects of AII: at moderate dose, a rapid vasoconstrictor action; at lower dose, a slow-developing but ultimately large hypertensive effect. Vascular hypertrophy develops during the slow pressor response; at least part of the hypertrophy results from a nonpressor mechanism. In vitro studies show that AII has mitogenic and trophic actions on vascular smooth muscle cells in culture and that it stimulates synthesis of extracellular matrix proteins. One of these actions may produce the nonpressor component of vascular hypertrophy. ACE inhibitors lower pressure in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) and when given in young animals produce a hypotensive effect that endures long after the period of treatment. An action of endogenous AII, possibly a paracrine effect within the vessel wall, may cause vascular hypertrophy in young SHR with long-lasting effects on arterial pressure.", 
    "217": "The renin system plays a critical role in hypertension as well as in the edematous states of heart failure, cirrhosis, and nephrosis. Properly performed measurements of plasma renin, with techniques now widely available, can be used as indicators of risk and of therapeutic strategies. The results of the plasma renin measurements are equally relevant whether they are high or low. The renin profile should be part of the routine workup of the patient with hypertension of any type or of the patient with an edematous disorder. Once the renin component of hypertension is established, management with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, such as perindopril, follows, for ACE inhibitors attack the pathophysiologic source, thus providing adequate perfusion and protection of vital organs. The role of renin's involvement in hypertensive states is elaborated, as well as that of the ACE inhibitors.", 
    "218": "Angiotensin II plays an important role in the kidney by regulating renal flow, glomerular filtration rate, mesangial cell function, and sodium reabsorption. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system has powerful effects on kidney function. Studies in animal models of renal failure suggest that converting enzyme inhibitors slow down the inevitable progression of the renal failure. This could be in part due to their effect on reducing glomerular pressure or by reducing glomerular hypertrophy. In patients with malignant hypertension, diabetic nephropathy, and other causes of renal failure, preliminary evidence suggests that lowering the blood pressure with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may possibly carry some other benefits compared with other blood pressure lowering regimens. However, single drug therapy is rarely sufficient to control blood pressure in these patients. Further properly controlled randomized trials should give a clear indication of whether any particular class of drug has any advantage in slowing down the progressive renal impairment for a given lowering of blood pressure. In patients with renovascular hypertension ACE inhibitors are effective drugs in lowering blood pressure. However, in certain settings they may cause a reversible decline in renal function.", 
    "219": "A universal underlying abnormality in the pathogenesis of hypertension, atherosclerosis, myocardial dysfunction, and diabetic glomerulosclerosis involves alteration in smooth muscle cell structure, function, and growth. Angiotensin II, through its effects on contractility, growth, and the sympathetic nervous system, may potentially play a key role in this pathologic process and, thus, contribute to the development of these cardiovascular and renal complications of diabetes mellitus. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and some direct renin inhibitors prevent or slow the progression of some of these complications, which further suggests a pathologic role for the reninangiotensin system in diabetes mellitus.", 
    "220": "We studied the long-term effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor perindopril, administered for 36 months on glycemic control, creatinine clearance, and albuminuria in hypertensive insulin-treated diabetics. After 1 month treatment with placebo, 39 patients entered the study and received 4-8 mg perindopril/day. Within the first 3 months, diastolic blood pressure was normalized in 80% of the patients. From these, 23 were followed during a total of 3 years on perindopril therapy, and divided in three groups according to their initial urinary albumin excretion rate (AER): 11 had normal AER (less than 15 mg/24 hours), eight had microalbuminuria (AER 15-150 mg/24 hour), and four had AER greater than 150 mg/24 hours and had overt proteinuria. Long-term (3 years) diastolic blood pressure normalization (less than or equal to 90 mm Hg) was achieved throughout the study. Concomitant with blood pressure reduction, a long-term decrease in AER was observed in normo- and microalbuminuric patients. Macroproteinuria was unaffected by perindopril. Glycemic control and creatinine clearance remained stable during the whole study period. No major side effects were observed. We conclude that perindopril safely produces a long-term normalization of elevated blood pressure in hypertensive insulin-treated diabetics without affecting glycemic control. Blood pressure normalization is associated with long-term AER reduction in normo- and microalbuminuric patients.", 
    "221": "In the present study, we examined whether antihypertensive treatment of young and adult hypertensive rats with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor perindopril could restore the baroreflex vagal deficit and whether this was related to prevention of cardiac or vascular hypertrophy. Spontaneously hypertensive (SHR), stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive (SHR-SP), and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats were untreated or treated with perindopril (3 mg/kg/day) in the drinking water from 4-9 and from 14-20 weeks of age. Steady-state sigmoidal mean arterial pressure (MAP)-heart rate (HR) reflex curves were obtained in the conscious rats by the injection of pressor and depressor agents before and after atenolol (vagal component). Increased left ventricle to bodyweight ratio (LV/BW) indicated cardiac hypertrophy. After ganglion blockade, the minimum MAP produced by nitroprusside and the maximum produced by methoxamine were used as indications of vascular hypertrophy. Perindopril treatment reduced cardiac and vascular hypertrophy to different extents in SHR and SHR-SP. The 4-9 and 14-20 week treatments reduced MAP and both minimum and maximum blood pressure of the SHR to the levels of the untreated WKY. However, only in the older animals was LV/BW restored. In the SHR-SP, early treatment had a much greater effect on vascular hypertrophy than on LV/BW. The reverse occurred for the 14-20 week animals. In untreated hypertensive animals the baroreflex curves were shifted to the right with reduced vagal HR range. Perindopril treatment shifted the baroreflex curves back towards the WKY curves. Vagal HR range was strongly correlated with the LV/BW, whereas vagal HR range was less well related to the level of vascular hypertrophy or blood pressure. These results suggest that antihypertensive treatment can restore cardiac baroreflex function and that it is related to the reduction in cardiac hypertrophy. Although the mechanism of this relationship remains to be elucidated, these findings suggest that cardiac vagal afferents may be important.", 
    "222": "The effect of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor quinapril on myocardial ischaemia was tested in a randomized double-blind cross-over study of 16 men (mean age 62 [44-75] years) with angiographically demonstrated coronary heart disease, exercise-induced ST-segment depression and stable angina. Exercise ECGs were recorded before and 4 hours after a single dose of 10 mg quinapril and after a 14-day course of 10 mg quinapril twice daily. The single dose decreased the average ST-segment depression from 1.12 mV (placebo) to 0.74 mV (P less than 0.05); after 14 days on quinapril the ST-segment depression decreased from 0.91 mV (placebo) to 0.72 mV (P less than 0.05). While heart rate remained unchanged the average resting arterial blood pressure fell from 136/80 to 120/74 mmHg (P less than 0.05) after a single dose and from 141/83 to 127/78 mmHg (P less than 0.05) after 14 days on the drug. These data indicate that ACE inhibitors should be considered as a means of treating coronary heart disease and angina.", 
    "223": "The active site of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) has been shown by chemical modification to contain a critical tyrosine residue, identified as Tyr-200 in human testis ACE (hTACE). We have expressed a mutant hTACE containing a Tyr-200 to Phe mutation. The mutant exhibits a marked decrease in kcat: 15-fold and 7-fold for the hydrolysis of furanacryloyl-Phe-Gly-Gly and angiotensin I, respectively, whereas its Km increases by only 1.6- and 2.2-fold, respectively. We conclude that Tyr-200 is not required for substrate binding. Instead, the effect on kcat together with a 100-fold decrease in affinity for the ACE inhibitor lisinopril indicates that Tyr-200 may participate in catalysis by stabilizing the transition state complex. Thus, Tyr-200 in hTACE has a role analogous to that of Tyr-198 in carboxypeptidase A.", 
    "224": "Inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) exert favorable regional hemodynamic effects at various sites. In patients with essential hypertension, ACE inhibitors reduce renal vascular resistance while enhancing renal blood flow, glomerular filtration rate, and acute and sustained natriuresis. Whereas these agents may either reduce or have no effect on hepatic blood flow, they are associated with reduced splanchnic resistance. ACE inhibitors reduce total peripheral resistance and may maintain limb blood flow. In normal subjects, they augment blood flow to skeletal muscle and skin and reduce peripheral resistance in vessels supplying these regions. ACE inhibitors appear to exert a vasodilatory effect on large arteries as well as arterioles. Dilatation is often accompanied by significant improvements in arterial compliance, possibly due to direct effects of the renin-angiotensin system on the arterial wall. Reduction of blood pressure is generally not accompanied by reduced cerebral blood flow. Enhanced tissue effects of newer ACE inhibitors such as quinapril may result in improved regional hemodynamic effects.", 
    "225": "Advances in renal angiography and revascularization techniques have renewed interest in developing a better noninvasive screening test for identifying patients with potentially correctable renovascular hypertension. Captopril renography is a promising diagnostic tool in the evaluation of the hypertensive patient. This review highlights the important pathophysiological changes in renal hemodynamics and humoral response attributable to significant renal artery stenosis, and underscores the dramatic effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition on the renovascular bed. The review also summarizes the available clinical information in captopril renography, and presents consensus recommendations on appropriate patient selection, radionuclide(s) of choice, and suggested diagnostic criteria.",

    "227": "All reports of angio-oedema reactions associated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors submitted to Swedish Adverse Reactions Advisory Committee were reviewed and the clinical courses summarised. Numbers of cases judged to be induced by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors were related to their annual usage, estimated from total sales of defined daily doses, as well as to the estimated number of new patients. All cases of angio-oedema associated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors reported to the World Health Organisation's international drug information system were also summarised.", 
    "228": "36 of the 38 reported cases in Sweden between 1981 and 1990 were judged to be related to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. During 1981 through 1990, altogether 1309 cases of angio-oedema associated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors were registered with the international drug information system. The incidence of reported cases of angio-oedema increased largely in parallel with the increased sales (usage) of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Of the 36 Swedish patients, 77% experienced the reaction within the first three weeks after starting treatment. 10 patients needed hospitalisation, two of whom had life threatening laryngeal obstruction. With one exception all 36 patients were free of symptoms within one week after discontinuing the drug.", 
    "229": "Angio-oedema induced by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors is a rare but potentially life threatening reaction, which in most instances occurs shortly after the start of treatment. Any patient in whom the reaction is suspected should have the treatment interrupted and, if necessary, be admitted for observation.",

The review included articles indexed under the terms congestive heart failure and drug therapy in the National Library of Medicine's MEDLINE database.", 
    "232": "Studies selected for detailed review were those having mortality as a primary or secondary end point.",

    "234": "Review of the existing literature demonstrates that pharmacologic agents that improve resting hemodynamics or exercise duration in patients with CHF may not necessarily prolong survival. However, recent studies demonstrate that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors prolong survival in patients with symptomatic CHF, while at the same time improving exercise capacity and left ventricular performance. Although less well tolerated, the combination of hydralazine hydrochloride and isosorbide dinitrate therapy also improves survival, but to a lesser degree. New agents show promise, but definitive assessment requires the results of large, randomized and double-blind studies having mortality as an end point.", 
    "235": "Mortality is an important end point in assessing the efficacy of drugs for the treatment of CHF.", 
    "236": "This review compares the metabolism and pharmacokinetic profiles of captopril, the first orally active angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, and 2 newer ACE inhibitors, enalapril and quinapril. Captopril differs from both enalapril and quinapril in that its chemical structure contains a sulfhydryl group, the presence of which may be important in the development of adverse reactions. Captopril also differs from enalapril and quinapril in its ability to be metabolized in plasma. Enalapril and quinapril are both de-esterified, most likely in the liver, to their active metabolites, enalaprilat and quinaprilat. All 3 ACE inhibitors are eliminated primarily via renal excretion, and renal dysfunction markedly increases the area under the time versus plasma concentration curves. Hepatic dysfunction also slows the conversion of enalapril and quinapril to their active metabolites. There is evidence that both captopril and enalapril, but not quinapril, may accumulate with repeated dosing. The pharmacokinetics of these agents are not significantly modified by co-administration of other drugs. However, captopril does cause marked increases in trough plasma levels of digoxin. Overall, the pharmacokinetic profiles of captopril, enalapril, and quinapril make them suitable for a wide range of patients with hypertension or congestive heart failure.", 
    "237": "Whereas many physicians have been reluctant to treat hypertension in the elderly because of perceived limited benefits and the risk of side effects associated with traditional antihypertensive agents such as diuretics and beta blockers, studies and clinical experience have shown that elderly as well as younger patients can benefit from treatment. In recent years, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been found to be safe and effective in both young and elderly hypertensive patients without many of the adverse effects associated with traditional agents. ACE inhibitors possess characteristics that meet many of the special needs of elderly patients, including reduction of left ventricular mass, lack of metabolic and lipid disturbances, no central nervous system effects, no risk of induction of cardiac failure, and low risk of orthostatic hypotension.", 
    "238": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are useful first-line drugs in the therapy of mild and moderate hypertension. Adverse reactions to this drug class are rarely serious. Hypotension, cough, rash, and taste disturbance are uncommon; reduced glomerular filtration and hyperkalemia occur infrequently; angioedema is rare and neutropenia is extremely rare. Quinapril is a new ACE inhibitor that is converted to biologically active quinaprilat in the liver. This ACE inhibitor has a rapid onset of action and inhibits local tissue converting enzyme systems in kidney, heart, and brain, as well as in the circulating renin-angiotensin system. Clinically significant adverse effects of quinapril occur at low rates. In 1,771 patients receiving quinapril, the reported incidence of the first occurrence of orthostatic hypotension was comparable to that seen in patients receiving placebo. In other studies, headache was reported by up to 4.7% of patients receiving quinapril, which is comparable to reported incidences of headache in patients receiving other ACE inhibitors. Other adverse events reported at rates greater than 1% include cough with associated rhinitis and bronchitis, dizziness, and somnolence. Such adverse events have only rarely led to the withdrawal of patients from clinical studies of quinapril.", 
    "239": "The adverse effects of certain antihypertensive medications, most notably diuretics and beta blockers, on serum lipids, glucose, and potassium may explain why control of hypertension has not been accompanied by declines in coronary artery disease. Evidence indicates that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, including quinapril, the newest member of this class of drugs, have no deleterious effects on these coronary risk factors. In addition to differences in chemical structure, the unique activity of quinapril at the local tissue level might to some degree explain its comparatively favorable clinical profile. Consequently, ACE inhibiting agents may be better choices for the management of patients with mild-to-moderately elevated blood pressure. However, controlled clinical trials with these drugs are needed to determine their impact on events related to coronary artery disease.", 
    "240": "Components of the renin-angiotensin system, and the ability to synthesize these components locally, have been demonstrated in cardiovascular tissues. Locally generated angiotensin II may affect vascular tone, regional blood flow, cardiac contractility, and vascular and cardiac growth. Local renin-angiotensin systems may exert autocrine and paracrine functions, whereas the circulating system serves an endocrine function. Use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors has provided further clarification of the activities of local renin-angiotensin systems. Tissue and systemic effects of these agents may prove equally important in determining their clinical efficacy. Experiments with quinapril demonstrated that inhibition of vascular ACE was a significant component of the antihypertensive effect of the drug. Differences at the tissue level may have implications for the efficacy and tolerability of a particular agent. Improved individualization of therapy may be accomplished by the use of newer ACE inhibitors with very favorable side effects profiles and tissue specificity. The newest agent, quinapril, appears to exert an important effect on vascular converting enzyme.", 
    "241": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and calcium antagonists are important classes of antihypertensive agents. Within their respective classes, ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists share common pharmacokinetic properties, but in contrast to ACE inhibitors, some calcium antagonists may cause a significant increase in plasma digoxin concentrations. Clinically, both classes of agents have been shown to be safe and effective in large-scale, long-term clinical trials. ACE inhibitors appear to be very well tolerated and may be associated with fewer adverse effects than some calcium antagonists. ACE inhibitors appear to blunt diuretic-induced hypokalemia, hypercholesterolemia, hyperuricemia, and hyperglycemia. Both classes of agents can be used safely in patients with renal disease, diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. They may also be used in the elderly. While ACE inhibitors are particularly useful in hypertension accompanied by congestive heart failure, calcium antagonists can be very useful when angina pectoris is present in the hypertensive patient.", 
    "242": "Nephropathy may develop in patients with sickle cell disease. We determined the prevalence of proteinuria and renal insufficiency in a group of patients with sickle cell disease and investigated the renal pathologic changes and the effects of an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (enalapril) on protein excretion in patients found to have nephropathy.", 
    "243": "We prospectively screened 381 patients with sickle cell disease for the presence of proteinuria and renal insufficiency. Renal biopsy and measurements of glomerular filtration rate, effective renal plasma flow, and urinary protein excretion were performed in 10 patients with mild nephropathy before and after the administration of enalapril, and again two to three weeks after its discontinuation.", 
    "244": "Of the 381 patients with sickle cell disease, 26 (7 percent) had serum creatinine concentrations above the normal range and 101 (26 percent) had proteinuria of at least 1+. The renal lesions in the 10 patients who had biopsies consisted of glomerular enlargement and perihilar focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. The mean (+/- SD) glomerular area in these patients was 28.7 +/- 4.1 x 10(3) micron 2, as compared with 15.8 +/- 4.3 x 10(3) micron 2 in 10 control patients without renal disease who had died of trauma (P less than 0.0001). During the administration of enalapril, the mean 24-hour urinary protein excretion decreased 57 percent (range, 23 to 79 percent) below the base-line value (P less than 0.001), and it increased to 25 percent below the base-line value after enalapril was discontinued. The glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow did not change significantly.", 
    "245": "Approximately 25 percent of patients with sickle cell disease have proteinuria. Treatment with enalapril reduces the degree of proteinuria in these patients, suggesting that glomerular capillary hypertension may be a pathogenic factor in sickle cell nephropathy.", 
    "246": "In addition to the classic circulating renin-angiotensin system, increasing evidence supports the existence of local tissue renin-angiotensin systems (vascular, cardiac, kidney, and brain) that appear to participate in cardiovascular homeostasis and in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disorders via multiple autocrine and paracrine functions. Components of local systems have been detected in cardiovascular tissues. Studies with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors provide further evidence of the existence and importance of tissue renin-angiotensin systems. The blood pressure-lowering effect of quinapril, for example, correlated better with inhibition of tissue ACE (aorta) than with inhibition of plasma ACE. The effects of ACE inhibitors on local tissue renin-angiotensin systems (vascular in particular) may be the crucial determinant of response to treatment. Newer ACE inhibitors, such as quinapril, have favorable side effect profiles as well as apparent tissue specificity for the vascular renin-angiotensin system (and possibly other relevant cardiovascular tissue). Differentiation among ACE inhibitors should play an even more important role in the future for individualization of therapy.", 
    "247": "This review summarizes the evidence indicating that local synthesis of angiotensin II, and interference with this process by inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), may be important in the treatment of hypertension. Inhibition of tissue converting enzyme generally has a stronger correlation with the hemodynamic effects of ACE inhibitors than inhibition of ACE in plasma. Reported differences in the ability of ACE inhibitors to penetrate tissues and to bind to the converting enzyme may be closely related to the relative lipophilicity of these agents. Finally, correlation of data from clinical studies with results provided by laboratory experimentation suggests that the efficacy of different ACE inhibitors in hypertensive patients may be predicted from differences among the actions of these drugs in vitro and in whole animals.", 
    "248": "Hypertension is often seen in Type 1 and Type 2 diabetic patients, particularly in those with nephropathy, and the progression of diabetic nephropathy is closely related to blood pressure elevation. Thus, the effects of antihypertensive drugs on kidney function and insulin sensitivity in diabetic patients are of great clinical importance.Successful antihypertensive treatment has been shown to slow the progression of diabetic nephropathy. Several results from short term studies have suggested that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may be advantageous over other conventional antihypertensive agents in reducing albuminuria in both hypertensive and normotensive diabetics with microalbuminuria or persistent proteinuria. However, the decline in glomerular filtration rate during ACE inhibitor treatment is comparable to that during effective treatment with conventional antihypertensive drugs in hypertensive Type 1 diabetic patients with overt nephropathy. Whether ACE inhibitors possess a specific effect in preventing the development of diabetic nephropathy remains to be seen in properly designed long term studies. Although calcium antagonists may preserve kidney function or possess a renoprotective effect in hypertensive Type 2 diabetics with nephropathy, firm evidence supporting this contention seems to be lacking and also requires long term evaluation.Increasing attention is being directed toward the effect of antihypertensive drugs on insulin sensitivity in diabetic patients: ACE inhibitors and \u03b1-adrenoceptor blocking agents have been shown to improve this sensitivity. Despite the widespread involvement of calcium in hormone secretion and action, calcium antagonists appear to have little effects on the glucoregulatory and calcium-regulatory hormones within the drug dosages used in clinical practice.Several clinical variables, such as the presence or absence of hypertension, overt nephropathy and microalbuminuria, or a combination of variables should be accounted for when evaluating critically the cumulative data on the effects of antihypertensive drugs on kidney function and albuminuria in the variety of diabetic patient groups. Understanding the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of antihypertensive drugs will be of clinical importance in diabetic patients with advanced nephropathy (glomerular filtration rate of < 30 ml/min) and/or other complications, such as impaired gastric motility or gastroparesis, and will thereby lead to a more rational management of hypertension in those patients.", 
    "249": "In order to clarify the sites of metabolism and the metabolizing enzymes of imidapril hydrochloride ((-)-(4S)-3-[(2S)-2-[[(1S)-1- ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl]amino]propionyl]-1-methyl-2- oxoimidazolidine-4-carboxylic acid hydrochloride, imidapril, TA-6366, CAS 89396-94-1), metabolism studies were carried out using rat, dog, monkey, and human plasma and rat tissue homogenates. After incubating with the various plasma samples, imidapril was mainly metabolized to the pharmacologically active metabolite, 6366 A (M1, CAS 89371-44-8), in rat plasma; on the other hand, the ester bond of imidapril was not hydrolyzed in dog, monkey, and human plasma. Imidapril was metabolized to M1, M2, M3, and M4 in all rat tissue homogenates tested. Aside from the above metabolites, no other metabolites were detected. The metabolic activity of imidapril to M1 was the highest in the liver, followed by the kidney and lung; however, it was low in other tissue homogenates. From the results of experiments using certain esterase inhibitors, it has been concluded that the metabolic conversion of imidapril to M1 is mainly due to a carboxylesterase (B-esterase). In contrast, the metabolic activity of imidapril to M2 and M3 (or M4) was highest in the kidney and small intestine while low in other tissues. From the experiments using certain enzyme inhibitors, it has been found that an acetylesterase (C-esterase) is largely involved in the metabolism of imidapril into M2 and M3.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "250": "The pharmacokinetics and excretion of the main metabolites of imidapril hydrochloride ((-)-(4S)-3-[(2S)-2-[[(1S)-1-ethoxycarbonyl-3- phenylpropyl]amino]propionyl]-1-methyl-2-oxoimidazolidine-4-carboxylic acid hydrochloride, imidapril, TA-6366, CAS 89396-94-1) were investigated in rats, dogs, and monkeys after oral or intravenous administration of [N-methyl-14C]-imidapril and [alanine-3-14C]-imidapril. After oral administration of 14C-labeled imidapril to rats and dogs, the plasma concentrations of the pharmacologically active metabolite, 6366 A (M1, CAS 89371-44-8), reached a peak at 1-2 h in rats and at 2-6 h in dogs. The disappearance half-lives of M1 from plasma were much longer in dogs (6.3-9.3 h) than in rats (0.9-2.3 h). At the point of peak plasma radioactivity, the major radioactive metabolites in the plasma were M2, followed by M3, M4 greater than M1 in rats; in dogs, M2 and M3 followed by M1 greater than M4. After intravenous administration of [N-methyl-14C]-imidapril to rats and dogs, plasma levels of M1 reached a peak at the first measuring time of 5 min in rats and at about 2 h in dogs. The half-lives of plasma M1 levels were similar to those after oral dosing. At 1 h after dosing, the major metabolites in plasma were M1 followed by M2 in both rats and dogs.

Radio-chromatographic analysis of the metabolites of imidapril from the plasma, urine, and bile of rats, dogs, or monkeys resulted in the detection of at least four metabolites. These four metabolites were isolated and characterized by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry(GC-MS). Of these metabolites, M1 (6366 A, CAS 89371-44-8) was pharmacologically active; however, M2, M3, and M4 were inactive. There was no evidence of any glucuronides or sulfates of drug-related compounds, or of the piperazine-dione lactam type metabolites of imidapril or 6366 A in the urine of the animals used. Imidapril was metabolized by hydrolysis at the carboxylic ethyl ester side-chain to give M1, and by cleavage of the amide bond to form M2 and M3. M4 was formed by hydrolysis of M3 and/or cleavage of the amide bond of M1. Qualitatively, the same metabolites were found in all animal species tested; however, quantitatively, there were differences in the amounts of metabolites formed depending on the species.",

The placental transfer and the secretion into milk were studied using whole-body autoradiographic methods and/or quantitative determination of total radioactivity after autopsy. Irrespective of the stages of pregnancy, the placental transfer of imidapril was low in the rats after oral administration. The transfer of total radioactivity per fetus on the 13th and 19th day of pregnancy was below 0.001 and 0.07%, respectively, of the dose to their dams during the observation periods. This indicates that the substance-associated radioactivity penetrates the placental barrier to a low extent. After oral administration of [N-methyl-14C]-imidapril to lactating rats on the 7th day after delivery, the concentration of radioactivity in the milk attained a peak at 4 h after administration (0.05 microgram equivalents of imidapril/g), which was about 1/3 of Cmax in the blood. The transfer of imidapril and/or its radioactive metabolites to each suckling via milk after oral dosing was only below 0.03% of the dose to the dams on the 13th day after delivery during the observation periods.

During the consecutive oral administration, the plasma radioactivity levels at 1 h after each dose reached steady-state following the 3rd to 4th administered dose; this was about 1.4 times higher than the corresponding plasma levels of the first dose. At 24 h after each administration, the plasma levels attained a steady-state at 3-4 days after the beginning of the consecutive dosing. Examination of the time course of plasma radioactivity after the single and multiple (7 and 14 times) oral administration revealed that the Cmax and AUCO-24 h values slightly, but significantly, increased according to repeated dosing and the beta-phase of the t1/2 of disappearance became longer after consecutive dosing. However, these values were not markedly different among consecutive dosing groups. The extent and rate of excretion of radioactivity in the urine and feces were nearly constant during the periods of consecutive oral administration, and were also similar to those after the single oral administration.

Imidapril was relatively rapidly absorbed from the digestive tract and easily metabolized to the pharmacologically active 6366 A after oral dosing in the rats and dogs. Thus, imidapril proved to be an orally usable 6366 A prodrug. More than 62% and 38% of the dose were assumed to be absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract in the rats and dogs, respectively. The in situ absorption study showed that [N-methyl-14C]-imidapril was absorbed from nearly the entire rat small intestine, especially from the jejunum, but hardly absorbed from the stomach.

However, 6366 A, like imidapril, had no effect on angiotensin II (AT-II), norepinephrine, serotonin-, KCl- and PGF2 alpha-induced contractions. The inhibitory effect of 6366 A on AT-I-induced contraction was attenuated by denudation of the endothelium, but it was still maintained even after washing out the aorta that had been previously exposed to the medium containing 6366 A. This suggests that 6366 A persistently inhibits the angiotensin I converting enzyme located preferentially in the endothelium. Therefore, the antihypertensive action of imidapril is mainly attributable to the vasodilation through the inhibitory effects of 6366 A on AT-II synthesis and BK degradation in the vasculature.",

In the control group, GFR and RPF were markedly attenuated. However, both were preserved at much higher levels in the ACEI-treated group, and GFR was also maintained to a similar degree in the CCB-treated group. Histological studies were carried out after the clearance studies. As a result, it was found that the ACEI treatment significantly limited the development of glomerulosclerosis, whereas CCB modestly ameliorated the glomerular structural lesions. Moreover, ACEI significantly reduced the serum cholesterol, while CCB did not exert such an effect.

A significant NFBP was observed in the patients of groups I and V, a significant but smaller NFBP in the hypertensives of groups II and IV, and no NFBP in the patients of group III. Administration of the antihypertensive drugs, enalapril and nifedipine, tended to augment the NFBP. These preliminary observations showed that NFBP did occur in elderly hypertensives but the fall was smaller than that observed in younger hypertensives or elderly normotensives.

DIABETIC HYPERTENSIVES WITH ABNORMAL ALBUMINURIA: Antihypertensive therapy, particularly with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, typically produces a permanent reduction in the decline of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in diabetic patients with abnormal albuminuria. The rate of decline in the GFR during antihypertensive treatment is a well accepted end-point in diabetic renal disease. DIABETIC HYPERTENSIVES WITHOUT ABNORMAL ALBUMINURIA: In insulin-dependent diabetic patients with essential hypertension but with normal urinary albumin excretion there is no reduction in the GFR. Longitudinal studies have shown a fall in the GFR only in the presence of significantly increased urinary albumin excretion. ABNORMAL ALBUMINURIA AS A MARKER OF INCIPIENT NEPHROPATHY: Micro-albuminuria and proteinuria may be pathogenetic factors in the development of nephropathy, leading eventually to end-stage renal failure in diabetic patients. Measurements of micro-albuminuria and proteinuria, in addition to blood pressure recordings, might therefore be used as indications for initiating antihypertensive treatment. NEED TO MONITOR PATIENTS FOR ABNORMAL ALBUMINURIA: Transglomerular macromolecular traffic may produce mesangial damage, with subsequent glomerulopathy and diabetic nephropathy. Thus, close monitoring for micro-albuminuria and proteinuria is desirable in the management of diabetic hypertensive patients.",

During those six months, 2,877 patients were admitted to the medical and geriatric services of whom 140 (4.9%) had heart failure. Only 29 patients in heart failure were under the age of 65 years. In 86 patients the mode of presentation was acute pulmonary oedema. Fifty-two (37%) patients had an arrhythmia at the time of admission of whom 48 had atrial fibrillation. An electrocardiogram, a chest X-ray, and an echocardiogram were performed in 137, 136, and 81 patients respectively. The aetiology of heart failure was considered to be coronary artery disease (41%), valve disease (9%), hypertension (6%), cor pulmonale (4%), a dilated cardiomyopathy (1%), congenital heart disease (1%), thyrotoxicosis (1%), and unknown (36%). During the period of hospital stay 42 patients (30%) died; a further 20 patients (14%) died in a one-year follow-up.

Fourteen patients were on cyclosporin (CSA) and eight were receiving azathioprine with prednisolone (AZA). In each patient effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) was determined four times, first baseline, second with E, third as another baseline after a washout period, and fourth with N; and renal vascular resistance (RVR) was derived in each. ERPF and RVR were significantly compromised in the CSA group (202 +/- 55 ml/min and 65 +/- 18 mmHg/ml/min) compared to the AZA group (302 +/- 99 and 43 +/- 15 respectively). During E therapy, RVR further increased in the CSA group to 82 +/- 37 while it decreased in the AZA group to 31 +/- 7 (both changes were significant when compared to their respective baseline values). N, on the other hand, only significantly lowered RVR in the AZA group. Furthermore, two patients, one from each group, developed acute reversible renal failure shortly after E therapy. However, both agents were effective in lowering blood pressure to a comparable degree in both groups.

Blood and urine samples were collected over 72- and 24-hour periods, respectively, after the first single dose and last multiple dose for measurement of quinapril and quinaprilat concentrations. The renal clearance of quinapril and quinaprilat decreased with increasing renal insufficiency but did not result in significant changes in quinapril pharmacokinetics in patients with renal impairment. In contrast, quinaprilat maximum plasma concentration, trough and peak steady-state plasma concentrations, area under the plasma concentration-time curve, and half-life increased significantly with increasing renal insufficiency. The disposition of quinapril and quinaprilat was unchanged from single to multiple doses. Small changes in the pharmacokinetic disposition of quinapril, together with a decreased rate of quinaprilat elimination, resulted in increased quinaprilat plasma concentrations following administration of both single and multiple quinapril doses to normotensive patients with renal impairment. Thus, quinapril dosage adjustment may be required in some patients with renal impairment.",

Beginning at either 4 or 10 wk of age, male Wistar rats were treated with enalapril for 2 or 5 wk. Enalapril treatment had no significant effect on body weight and small, generally non-significant effects on systolic and diastolic blood pressures. In contrast, young enalapril-treated animals showed a marked decrease in accumulation of total elastin and collagen in both large (aorta, renal, and carotid) and smaller (superior and large mesenteric) arteries, as well as a large reduction in total collagen in both left and right ventricles. This effect also was present but less pronounced in rats treated with enalapril beginning at 10 wk of age.

Development of tolerance can be avoided by various approaches. In patients with stable angina, intermittent use of nitrates with long nitrate-free intervals, use of transdermal nitroglycerin during the day or oral isosorbide dinitrate or isosorbide-5-mononitrate twice daily in the morning and early afternoon, and intermittent use of nitrates in combination with another class of antianginal agent are appropriate. In patients with unstable angina, continuous therapy with intravenous nitroglycerin is recommended during the acute phase of angina. Despite development of partial tolerance, oral isosorbide dinitrate, 30 to 60 mg four times a day, plus hydralazine may be useful for patients with congestive heart failure who cannot tolerate angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Concomitant use of sulfhydryl donors or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, agents that might theoretically prevent nitrate tolerance, is not recommended. Data on these agents are conflicting, and added costs and adverse effects are likely to preclude their use in the future.",

Because angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to block intimal hyperplasia after arterial injury in the rat, it has been suggested that angiotensin II is an important mediator of the proliferative response to vascular injury. To prove that previous observations with use of ACE inhibitors are a result of effects on local angiotensin levels versus nonspecific drug effects, we tested the ability of an unrelated drug, the angiotensin II receptor antagonist saralasin, to similarly block intimal hyperplasia after aortic injury in the rat. Balloon catheter aortic denudation was performed in 28 rats pharmacologically treated for 14 days after surgery and split into four groups: group 1, saralasin 360 micrograms/kg/hr intravenously; group two, normal saline 0.5 mm3/hr intravenously; group 3, captopril 100 mg/kg/day orally; and group 4, heparin 50 U/kg/hr intravenously. Animals were killed and aortas were perfusion fixed at physiologic pressure 14 days after denudation. Cross-sectional intima-to-media ratios were calculated by computerized planimetry. Compared with saline controls, saralasin inhibited intimal hyperplasia 45% (p less than 0.001), captopril 59% (p less than 0.001), and heparin 68% (p less than 0.001). A reduction in total intimal area was also evident in animals treated with saralasin (p less than 0.01). Blood pressure in the group treated with captopril decreased from 107.4 +/- 3.9 to 96.3 +/- 4.3 mm Hg (p less than 0.01) after 6 days, whereas saralasin and heparin had no effect on blood pressure. Weight gain during the study was reduced in groups treated with captopril and heparin but not in the group treated with saralasin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

We therefore investigated the effect of inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system by SK&F 108566, a novel, nonpeptide angiotensin II (AII) receptor antagonist, or by enalapril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, on glycine-induced hyperfiltration. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) were measured by inulin and p-aminohippurate clearances in conscious chronically instrumented rats. Glycine infusion (3.7 mg/min i.v.; n = 8) significantly increased GFR by 27% (from 1.09 +/- 0.53 to 1.38 +/- 0.08 ml/min.100 g), ERPF by 22% (2.96 +/- 0.30 to 3.61 +/- 0.32 ml/min.100 g) and significantly decreased effective renal vascular resistance by 22% [from 25.4 +/- 2.9 to 20.8 +/- 2.5 mm Hg/(ml/min.100 g)]. SK&F 108566 (30 micrograms/kg.min) or enalapril (1 mg/kg), at doses which inhibited the pressor effects of AII or AI, respectively, but had no significant influence on base-line GFR and ERPF, significantly attenuated the glycine-induced glomerular hyperfiltration and hyperemia. In the presence of SK&F 108566 or enalapril, glycine resulted in only small, statistically insignificant changes in GFR (from 1.07 +/- 0.03 to 1.10 +/- 0.04 and from 1.19 +/- 0.03 to 1.21 +/- 0.08 ml/min.100 g, respectively), ERPF (from 3.27 +/- 0.21 to 3.53 +/- 0.26 and from 3.57 +/- 0.11 to 3.41 +/- 0.38 ml/min.100 g, respectively) and effective renal vascular resistance [from 21.2 +/- 1.9 to 19.2 +/- 1.6 and from 18.4 +/- 0.9 to 20.2 +/- 2.2 mm Hg/(ml/min.100 g], respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

We studied nine patients with steroid-requiring asthma, aged 9 to 16 years, who had elevated blood pressures during corticosteroid treatment. Unlike in previous studies, all nine patients developed hypertension during corticosteroid reduction. Diastolic blood pressures were 50 to 84 mm Hg during maximum corticosteroid therapy (1 to 4 mg/kg/day); these values were in the normal range for seven of the nine patients and in the high normal range for the other two patients. Maximum diastolic pressures were 100 to 120 mm Hg, 1 to 8 weeks after corticosteroid reduction was started. Hypertension occurred at 0% to 70% of their maximum corticosteroid dose. Corticosteroid reduction was the only medication change. Renal causes of hypertension were excluded. Six patients had levels of renin and aldosterone measured before onset of treatment. All six patients had elevated levels of renin, and five patients had elevated levels of aldosterone. Blood pressure elevations were resistant to diuretic therapy but responded rapidly to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Caretakers of subjects with asthma need to be aware that hypertension may occur both during maximum corticosteroid use and during corticosteroid reduction.", 
    "285": "Blood pressure declines in virtually all patients with severe congestive heart failure given an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, but hypotension is of concern only if symptomatic. Acute renal insufficiency induced by an ACE inhibitor is due to reduced renal perfusion pressure together with blockade of angiotensin II-induced constriction of the efferent arteriole. Risk factors (or markers) for renal failure include hyponatremia, hypotension, volume contraction. Hyponatremia is an index of increased hemodynamic impairment, marked activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis, and poor prognosis. Preventive measures for both ACE inhibitor-associated hypotension and renal insufficiency include withholding diuretics for a few days, initiating therapy with very small doses of ACE inhibitors, and cautious dose titration. Therapy for both hypotension and renal insufficiency involves increasing dietary sodium intake and reducing the dosage of, or temporarily discontinuing, the diuretic. The ACE inhibitor may have to be given at reduced dosage or discontinued for a time. If discontinuation is deemed necessary, administration of these survival-prolonging medications should be reinitiated after a brief respite whenever possible.",

Case histories consistent with diagnoses other than primary FGS (such as reflux nephropathy or intravenous drug use) were eliminated from the study. During this time period, 78 allografts were received by 71 patients with FGS. Independent variables that were analyzed included sex, race, time in months between the diagnosis of FGS and end-stage disease (dialysis or transplantation), age at time of transplantation, type of dialysis, source of allograft (cadaveric or living related), haplotype matching, donor-specific transfusions, age and sex of the donor, post-transplantation acute tubular necrosis, rejection episodes, immunosuppression regimen, use of plasmapheresis and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and outcome.",

Patients who had rapid progression to end-stage disease tended to experience more frequent recurrences. Of seven patients who received a second transplant, five patients lost the first graft to recurrent FGS, and four of those patients (80%) had a recurrence in the second allograft. Recurrent disease developed in 34% of patients concurrently treated with cyclosporine and in 28% of those treated with prednisone and azathioprine alone (NS). Patients with recurrent FGS who were treated with ACE inhibitors benefited from a significant reduction of proteinuria. Six patients underwent plasmapheresis after diagnosis of the recurrence. Three of five patients in whom the diagnosis was made early in the course of the disease and in whom plasmapheresis was initiated immediately had reversal of epithelial foot process effacement and remission of proteinuria. End-stage disease eventually developed in 14 allografts (56%) an average of 23.7 months (range: 1 to 65 months) after diagnosis of recurrent disease. The cause of failure was chronic rejection in four allografts and recurrent disease in the remaining 10 allografts.", 
    "289": "FGS recurs in approximately 30% of allografts and causes graft loss in half of these. Patients who have lost a first allograft to recurrent FGS are at high risk for developing recurrent disease in a second allograft. Prolonged allograft survival is possible in patients with recurrent FGS and may best be obtained with a combination of treatment modalities including cyclosporine (perhaps in higher dosages than are routinely used in clinical renal transplantation), ACE inhibitors, and early use of plasmapheresis. The efficacy of these modalities supports the notion that recurrent FGS is caused by a circulating humoral mediator.", 
    "290": "Diabetic nephropathy typically presents more than a decade after diagnosis of diabetes and correlates with the duration of poorly controlled disease. Diabetic nephropathy begins as glomerular hypertension and hyperfiltration, followed by microalbuminuria and the development of hypertension, overt proteinuria, nephrotic syndrome, and a progressive decline in the glomerular filtration rate. Increasing expansion of the glomerular mesangium correlates with loss of function, resulting in uremia. This process eventually leads to the need for dialysis or renal transplantation in 30 percent of patients with insulin-dependent diabetes. By lowering intraglomerular pressure through enhanced glycemic control, inhibition of angiotensin and limitation of protein intake, severe nephropathy may be prevented, delayed or even partially reversed. Treatment must stress control of hypertension.",

Accordingly, the ambulatory BP recordings of 236 mild to moderate hypertensive patients who had previously entered a clinical trial and had received either a calcium antagonist (n = 121) or an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (n = 115) were reviewed. The inclusion criterion was a clinic diastolic BP between 95 and 115 mm Hg at the end of the placebo period. Patients were classified according to the difference between their observed and predicted ambulatory BP (the latter assessed by regressing the observed ambulatory BP on the clinic BP). Reduction in ambulatory systolic and diastolic BP seemed to be greater (p less than 0.0001, p = 0.01) in patients receiving an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor than in those who were given a calcium antagonist. However, analysis of variance showed (1) there was a significant interaction (F = 6.37 p = 0.01) between the pharmacologic class and the baseline systolic ambulatory BP; and (2) the difference in diastolic ambulatory BP reduction between both classes was no longer significant when adjusted for baseline diastolic ambulatory BP. In patients with higher than predicted ambulatory BP levels, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium antagonists had roughly a similar effect (reduction in systolic BP, 9 +/- 8% vs 7 +/- 6%, p = not significant; reduction in diastolic BP, 11 +/- 8% vs 8 +/- 6%, p = not significant).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The underlying causes are contractile impairment due to myocyte loss and reduced compliance due to myocardial fibrosis.

This necrosis is not secondary to adrenergic activation or raised blood pressure. Similarly, renovascular hypertension results in cardiac myocyte necrosis, which can be prevented by pretreatment with the ACE inhibitor captopril. In established genetic hypertension in rats, sustained treatment with high-dose lisinopril normalizes the blood pressure, reverses left ventricular hypertrophy, reverses excessive interstitial and perivascular fibrosis (and consequently the impaired compliance), and reverses excessive coronary artery medial thickening (thereby normalizing coronary vascular reserve). With a low dose of lisinopril that does not reduce blood pressure significantly, only the excessive fibrosis is reversed.",

    "298": "Numerous pharmacologic agents are capable of lowering the blood pressure of hypertensive patients; however, each drug has a characteristic side effect profile and effect on cardiac performance. In this study, the hemodynamic effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor fosinopril were assessed at rest and at peak upright bicycle exercise by first-pass radionuclide cineangiography in 12 patients with essential hypertension. Fosinopril reduced blood pressure at rest in the seated position from 152/101 to 131/85 mm Hg (P less than .01) and at peak exercise from 206/103 to 184/91 mm Hg (P less than .01). Fosinopril therapy was associated with an increase in stroke volume and cardiac output and a decrease in systemic vascular resistance at rest and during peak exercise. Both peak ejection rate and peak filling rate increased significantly at rest during fosinopril therapy. The unique cardiotropic response to fosinopril may reflect its effects on the myocardial renin-angiotensin system, and suggests that this agent may offer a therapeutic advantage compared with other angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.",

Carotid arteries isolated at 4 weeks were examined morphometrically with a computerized digitizer after in situ glutaraldehyde fixation. Both in the deendothelialized and dilated arteries, the surface area in square millimeters of the neointima and media were similar in the treated and control animals; therefore, the ratio of neointima to media was again not different. The neointimal changes included a combination of proliferative changes as well as organization of mural thrombus and were equally well distributed in the two groups of animals. At the time that the animals were killed, blood pressure (38.2 +/- 2.1 versus 56.8 +/- 4.8 mm Hg, p = 0.003) and plasma angiotensin converting enzyme activity (5.6 +/- 4.1 versus 182.3 +/- 70.4, p = 0.02) were lower in treated than in control pigs, but aortic media thrombogenicity (as assessed in an ex vivo perfusion flow chamber) and serum lipids were not different between groups.",

We studied the hemodynamic effect of isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) by Doppler echocardiography in 7 patients with severe cardiac failure despite prolonged therapy with usually effective doses of captopril. The patients were evaluated before (H0) and 24 hours after treatment by ISDN (120 mg/24 hr) (H24) and 10 minutes after sublingual 0.75 mg of trinitrin (H24 + T). M mode echocardiography did not show any significant changes in chamber dimension as reported after vasodilator therapy in patients without cardiac dilation: in patients with severe left ventricular dilatation a reduction in LV filling pressures causes little if any changes in fractional shortening and ventricular dimensions. Two-dimensional echocardiography showed a reduction in end systolic volume and an increase in ejection fraction, emphasizing the superiority of this technique in cases of abnormal left ventricular function and the sensitivity of indices of systolic function to changes in afterload in these patients. Cardiac output measured by Doppler increased during the study. The maximal acceleration did not change significantly and pulmonary artery pressures were stable after administration of nitrates. ISDN caused a marked change in diastolic mitral flow patterns for which there are several explanations: an effect of ISDN on relaxation or LV compliance or on the conditions of LV filling or on both factors together. The presence of mitral regurgitation and/or atrial arrhythmia prevents the use of Doppler indices for analysis of diastolic LV function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The beneficial action on exercise capacity was recently demonstrated in the Veterans II Study in association with Hydralazine and has also been suggested by other trials. The reduction in mortality from cardiac failure was demonstrated in the Veterans I Study in association with Hydralazine compared to conventional digitalo-diuretic therapy but seems less important than that obtained by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. The phenomenon of tolerance seems to be related to the use of high doses in continuous therapy and may be countered by discontinuous use of the drug during the 24 hour period. Tolerance seems to be related to neuro-hormonal factors and perhaps to depletion of SH groups. Simultaneous use of nitrates and ACE inhibitors seems to be an interesting therapeutic concept.",

Captopril (CPT) (100 mg/kg/orally), on the development of functional and morphological alterations induced in rats by a single injection (7.5 mg/kg/iv) of Doxorubicin (DXR) (Adriamycin*), were investigated. Twenty-four-hour protein excretion, urine output, food intake, water intake, and body weight gain were measured weekly for 30 days. Transmission and scanning electron microscopy observations were performed on kidney samples after 30 days. Four groups were studied. Group 1 were control rats. Group 2 were rats injected with DXR. Group 3 were rats injected with DXR and treated with CPT for 30 days. Group 4 were rats injected with DXR and treated with CPT for 15 days (CPT treatment started 15 days after DXR injection). Group 1 did not show significant functional or morphological changes. Group 2 showed severe proteinuria, significant increase in urinary volume within 2 weeks, significant body weight reduction and diffuse morphological changes. These changes mainly consisted of podocyte swelling, severe foot process fusion, and presence of casts within tubular lumen. Group 3, with respect to group 2, showed a significant reduction of the 24 h protein excretion and urine output. This group displayed morphological changes similar to those observed in group 2, but with a focal distribution. Group 4 showed functional and morphological changes comparable with those of group 2. It is concluded that CPT partially inhibits the development of the functional and morphological damage induced by DXR in the rat kidney.

    "305": "Small increases in blood pressure are a feature of incipient diabetic nephropathy, and mean blood pressure often correlates with the degree of albuminuria in such patients. Antihypertensive therapy with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (CEI) or calcium channel blockers (CCB) has been assessed in several studies to determine if either form of treatment modifies incipient diabetic nephropathy and its evolution to established nephropathy. The acute renal hemodynamic effects of CEI differ from those of CCB under certain circumstances. In incipient diabetic nephropathy, therapy with CEI but not CCB tends to reduce filtration fraction, especially in hyperfiltering patients. In hypertensive patients with incipient diabetic nephropathy, both treatments result in a decrease in albuminuria and the responses are mainly dependent on the lowering of systemic blood pressure. In normotensive patients with incipient diabetic nephropathy, a lowering of mean blood pressure with CEI or CCB is not found consistently while effects on albuminuria are difficult to interpret. Short- and long-term therapy with CEI lowers or stabilizes albuminuria. Short-term administration of CCB has at times been associated with increases in albuminuria, but a comparison of CEI and CCB over 12 months in the Melbourne Diabetic Nephropathy Study (MDNS) has shown that both drugs stabilize albuminuria with no significant differences in their effects. Serial analysis of urinary sodium excretion in the MDNS shows that the hypotensive response to CEI in incipient nephropathy is highly dependent on sodium intake, and that sodium intake may modulate albuminuria during both CEI and CCB therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "306": "We have compared the effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, perindopril, and a conventional antihypertensive regimen (triple therapy: hydralazine, reserpine and hydrochlorothiazide) on kidney function and albuminuria in hypertensive diabetic rats. Diabetes was induced with streptozotocin in spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) rats and they were randomized to receive no treatment, perindopril or triple therapy. Antihypertensive drugs were commenced at the time of induction of diabetes and continued for 16 weeks. Blood pressure reduction was equal in the groups treated with perindopril or triple therapy. All groups had similar severity of diabetes as determined by body weight, serum glucose and glycated hemoglobin levels. Whereas plasma renin activity rose in both the perindopril and triple therapy groups, it is likely that the effects on angiotensin II levels were opposite since perindopril but not triple therapy was associated with a significant reduction in plasma angiotensin converting enzyme activity. Diabetes was associated with an increase in glomerular filtration rate. At 12 weeks, glomerular filtration rate was higher in the perindopril treated group when compared to the triple therapy group, but neither group treated with antihypertensive therapy was different to untreated diabetic rats. Both drug regimens reduced albuminuria in the diabetic rats to a similar degree apparently independently of their effects on the renin-angiotensin system. Studies in diabetic subjects are warranted to evaluate different classes of antihypertensive drugs with respect to their effects on kidney function, proteinuria and glomerular morphology.",

We studied the effect of the vasodilator hydralazine which acts via nitric oxide and thus is expected to have a gastroprotective action.

This effect is not influenced by pretreatment with the selective alpha 1 adrenergic antagonist prazosin but is abolished by the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril suggesting the involvement of the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "308": "Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors decrease blood pressure without causing reflex tachycardia in hypertensives, but do not always do so in normotensives. To investigate this phenomenon, hemodynamic changes in normotensive rabbits receiving a subpressor dose of norepinephrine were studied following captopril or diltiazem treatment. We also investigated the effect of captopril on baroreceptor reflex in relation to norepinephrine infusion; the baroreflex sensitivity was determined by the relationship between mean arterial pressure and pulse interval receiving graded doses of phenylephrine. Captopril infusion decreased mean arterial pressure and pulse interval from 84 +/- 4 to 74 +/- 5 mmHg and 244 +/- 7.4 to 216 +/- 7.6 msec, respectively. In contrast, in rabbits receiving a norepinephrine infusion captopril lowered mean arterial pressure to the same extent (92 +/- 5 to 76 +/- 3 mmHg, p less than 0.05) without producing reflex tachycardia. When diltiazem was administered, reflex tachycardia occurred in rabbits both with and without a norepinephrine infusion. There was no difference in the baroreflex sensitivity between rabbits receiving norepinephrine with and without captopril treatment. However, the baroreflex curve showed a slight shift to lower pressures after norepinephrine infusion in the rabbits receiving captopril. These results suggest that elevating circulating norepinephrine might be involved in preventing reflex tachycardia after captopril.", 
    "309": "Immunogold techniques were used to investigate renin processing within granular juxtaglomerular cells following short-term (6 h and 1 day) and long-term (4 weeks) enalapril treatment in female BALB/c mice. In control animals, renin protein labelling was localized to all types of granules (proto-, polymorphous, intermediate and mature) and to transport vesicles, whilst prorenin labelling was found in all these sites except mature granules, confirming that active renin is localized to mature granules only. Following short-term enalapril treatment, the exocytosis of renin protein from mature granules was increased. Long-term enalapril treatment resulted in increased numbers of transport vesicles and all types of granules, consistent with increased synthesis and storage of renin. More large intermediate granules contained discrete regions labelled for prorenin. Renin protein was exocytosed from individual and multiple granules, whilst prorenin was exocytosed from proto- and intermediate granules. It is concluded that under normal conditions prorenin is secreted constitutively by bulk flow from transport vesicles. On the other hand, active renin is secreted regulatively from mature granules. In conditions of intense stimulation (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition treatment), increased synthesis of prorenin leads to enhanced secretion of prorenin by both constitutive and regulative pathways. Under these conditions, the conversion of prorenin to active renin is increased, with increased secretion of active renin occurring in a regulative manner. Furthermore, the localization of prorenin to one discrete region of large intermediate granules leads us to conclude, that cleavage of the prosegment of renin occurs with the transition of intermediate to mature granules.", 
    "310": "To determine the effects of moderate versus severe dietary sodium restriction on the development of 2-kidney, 1-clip (2K,1C) hypertension, young male Wistar rats were placed on diets containing 9, 26, or 101 (control) mumol sodium/g food. Three days later, a solid silver clip (i.d. 0.20 mm) was placed on the left renal artery and diets were continued up to 6 weeks. Adult rats received a 0.25-mm clip. In young clipped rats receiving the 101 mumol/g diet, blood pressure (BP), plasma renin activity (PRA), and BP response to captopril were increased as early as 1 week after clipping and increased further over time. Moderate sodium restriction (26 mumol sodium/g) led to only a slight delay in the development of hypertension; the levels of BP and PRA, the BP response to captopril, and the extent of cardiac hypertrophy achieved by 6 weeks were not different between the 2K, 1C rats receiving 26 or 101 mumol sodium/g. Sodium restriction to 9 mumol/g decreased rate of growth and completely prevented the rise in BP and in left ventricular weight. At 3 and 6 weeks the severely sodium-restricted rats had significantly higher PRA levels than the 2K, 1C control group. However, the BP response to captopril was attenuated relative to the other hypertensive groups. In adult rats, this level of sodium restriction had a small, but significant effect on body weight, but still prevented the increase in BP and in left ventricular weight. In conclusion, dietary sodium restriction can prevent the development of 2K,1C hypertension in both young and adult rats, but only if the restriction is severe. This effect may relate to a marked reduction in the pressor effectiveness of the renin-angiotensin system by low sodium intake per se or by associated metabolic or other changes.",

(Group 1); 17 patients, matched by age, sex and BMI were treated with captopril 50 mg b.i.d. and hypocaloric diet (Group 2). During follow-up a good control of blood pressure levels (< 150/90 mmHg) and a significant reduction in body weight (> 10%) were achieved in all patients of Group 2. Left heart anatomy was accessed by 2D guided M-mode echocardiogram before starting treatment and after 6 months. In Group 1 Interventricular Septal Thickness (ST), Posterior Wall Thickness (PWT) and Left Ventricular Mass (LVM) decreased significantly (p < 0.01). In Group 2 not only ST, PWT and LVM decreased significantly (p < 0.01 for ST and PWT, p < 0.001 for LVM), but also left atrial dimension (p < 0.05) and left ventricular diastolic dimension (p < 0.01). The percent reduction in AD, LVDD and LVM was significantly higher (p < 0.01) in Group 2. In obese hypertensives relevant weight loss can improve the effect of captopril treatment on left ventricular hypertrophy; the decrease of AD and LVDD is probably secondary to a reduction of the volume overload present in obese patients.",

    "319": "Antihypertensive agents have been shown to exert inequivalent effects on glomerular injury in experimental renal disease models. To compare the consequences of dissimilar antihypertensive regimens on the development of diabetic glomerulopathy, studies were performed in three groups of uninephrectomized moderately hyperglycemic diabetic rats. One group (DM) received no therapy except insulin. The remaining groups received insulin and either the angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor, fosinopril (FOS), or the calcium channel blocker, nifedipine (NIF). Both drugs lowered blood pressure comparably. At four to eight weeks, DM rats exhibited elevation of the single nephron glomerular filtration rate (SNGFR), due to elevations of the glomerular capillary plasma flow rate (QA) and the glomerular capillary hydraulic pressure (PGC). Neither NIF nor FOS affected values for SNGFR or QA. However, while FOS lowered PGC and increased Kf, NIF did not affect these parameters. In longer term (8 month) studies, DM rats exhibited progressive albuminuria and glomerular sclerosis. FOS markedly limited development of albuminuria and glomerular injury, but NIF was ineffective in limiting either parameter of glomerular injury. Thus, in contrast to the beneficial effects of converting enzyme inhibitors, chronic calcium channel blockade with nifedipine fails to limit PGC or glomerular injury in diabetic rats. These findings lend further support to the concept that different classes of antihypertensive agents are not equally effective in protecting against diabetic glomerulopathy.",

The pathogenesis of impaired natriuresis in insulin dependent diabetes remains to be elucidated. The present study examines the role of hyperinsulinemia, impaired atrial natriuretic release, and resistance to atrial natriuretic peptide action in determining sodium retention in normotensive and hypertensive insulin-dependent diabetic patients. Eight insulin-dependent diabetic patients had significantly higher daily sodium excretion rate (147 +/- 16 mmol/day; mean +/- SE) during conventional insulin treatment (daily plasma glucose: 11.6 +/- 1.2 mmol/liter; daily plasma insulin: 27 +/- 3 microU/ml) than during intensified insulin treatment (daily sodium excretion rate: 91 +/- 12, P less than 0.01; daily plasma glucose: 6.8 +/- 0.7, P less than 0.01; daily plasma insulin: 44 +/- 4, P less than 0.01). Daily sodium excretion rate was also significantly lower (107 +/- 13, P less than 0.01) in the same diabetic patients during intensified insulin treatment along with hyperglycemic clamp (daily plasma glucose: 12.8 +/- 0.3, NS; plasma insulin 48 +/- 4, P less than 0.01).

Endothelium-removed aorta from 16-week-old SHRSP exhibited a high amplitude of spontaneously developed active tension (active tone), whereas no active tone was observed in the preparation from control normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. Treatment with SQ29852 or captopril at age 5-16 weeks prevented the development of hypertension. No active tone could be detected in the preparation from SQ29852-treated SHRSP. Endothelium-dependent relaxation was markedly reduced in the preparation from nontreated SHRSP compared with WKY rats. Treatment with SQ29852 prevented the impairment of endothelium-dependent relaxation. It was also shown that norepinephrine-induced contraction was markedly depressed in endothelium-intact aorta from SQ29852-treated rats. The effects of SQ29852 were more prominent than those of hydralazine when blood pressure was maintained at similar levels. It was suggested that SQ29852 exerts an action on both vascular smooth muscle and endothelium that is mediated by the inhibition of angiotension-converting enzyme in addition to indirect actions of SQ29852 that are brought about by blood pressure lowering.",

Treatment with captopril was found to attenuate pressor responses produced by the administration of either alpha 1- or alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists, resulting in the displacement to the right of the agonist dose-response curves and significantly increasing the calculated ED50 values. The maximum response was unaltered and the calculated dose ratios for alpha-agonists in the presence or absence of captopril were found to be 3, 4.6, and 3.8 for B-HT 920, St 587, and cirazoline, respectively. In comparison, nifedipine displaced the dose-response curves for all three alpha-agonists to the right but only significantly increased the ED50 values for the partial alpha 1-agonist St 587 and the alpha 2-agonist B-HT 920, with the calculated dose ratios being 3.2 and 3.8, respectively. Following treatment with nifedipine, however, the maximum responses were significantly reduced. A combination of captopril and nifedipine did not result in any significant additive increase in the ED50 values compared to those obtained with captopril or nifedipine alone. However, the inhibition of the maximum response to B-HT 920 by a combination of captopril and nifedipine was additive.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "323": "The purpose of the present study was to evaluate whether in addition to its myocardial effects, chronic beta-adrenergic stimulation with isoproterenol could modify the coronary vasculature. For this purpose, rats were treated for 2 weeks with isoproterenol, and the hearts were isolated for determination of the minimal coronary vascular resistance under maximal vasodilation and then perfused-fixed for morphometry of the coronary arteries. In addition, because isoproterenol stimulates the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition on the coronary vasculature were assessed. Isoproterenol increased heart weight by 65% and minimal coronary resistance by 55%. This effect was associated with medial thickening in intermediate (32%) and large coronary arterioles (26%). Cilazapril, a long-acting ACE inhibitor, completely prevented the medial thickening induced by isoproterenol and normalized the minimal coronary resistance. We conclude that impairment of the rat coronary vasculature induced by chronic beta-adrenergic stimulation might be in part mediated by activation of the RAS.", 
    "324": "Hypertension is often seen in Type 1 and Type 2 diabetic patients, particularly in those with nephropathy, and the progression of diabetic nephropathy is closely related to blood pressure elevation. Thus, the effects of antihypertensive drugs on kidney function and insulin sensitivity in diabetic patients are of great clinical importance. Successful antihypertensive treatment has been shown to slow the progression of diabetic nephropathy. Several results from short term studies have suggested that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may be advantageous over other conventional antihypertensive agents in reducing albuminuria in both hypertensive and normotensive diabetics with microalbuminuria or persistent proteinuria. However, the decline in glomerular filtration rate during ACE inhibitor treatment is comparable to that during effective treatment with conventional antihypertensive drugs in hypertensive Type 1 diabetic patients with overt nephropathy. Whether ACE inhibitors possess a specific effect in preventing the development of diabetic nephropathy remains to be seen in properly designed long term studies. Although calcium antagonists may preserve kidney function or possess a renoprotective effect in hypertensive Type 2 diabetics with nephropathy, firm evidence supporting this contention seems to be lacking and also requires long term evaluation. Increasing attention is being directed toward the effect of antihypertensive drugs on insulin sensitivity in diabetic patients: ACE inhibitors and alpha 1-adrenoceptor blocking agents have been shown to improve this sensitivity. Despite the widespread involvement of calcium in hormone secretion and action, calcium antagonists appear to have little effects on the glucoregulatory and calcium-regulatory hormones within the drug dosages used in clinical practice. Several clinical variables, such as the presence or absence of hypertension, overt nephropathy and microalbuminuria, or a combination of variables should be accounted for when evaluating critically the cumulative data on the effects of antihypertensive drugs on kidney function and albuminuria in the variety of diabetic patient groups. Understanding the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of antihypertensive drugs will be of clinical importance in diabetic patients with advanced nephropathy (glomerular filtration rate of less than 30 ml/min) and/or other complications, such as impaired gastric motility or gastroparesis, and will thereby lead to a more rational management of hypertension in those patients.",

In a cohort of patients receiving antihypertensive treatment predominantly consisting of beta blockers in combination with diuretics, support for an improved survival has been presented.

In 10 insulin-dependent diabetic patients with early diabetic nephropathy [urinary albumin excretion rate (UAE) less than 100o micrograms/min], who were receiving continuous therapy with metoprolol and bendroflumethiazide, a double-blind crossover study with four months addition of ramipril 5 mg (Ramace) and placebo was conducted.

In comparison with placebo, RIL significantly decreased BP. In double-blind comparative trials versus first-line diuretics and beta-blockers, RIL normalized BP in approximately 60% patients, showing a similar efficacy to other drugs. In contrast with hydrochlorothiazide, RIL decreased total cholesterol and did not change plasma potassium levels. No tachyphylaxis was observed during long-term treatment. Central side effects, which have contributed to the limitation of the use of alpha 2-agonists as second- or third-line therapy for hypertension, were significantly less frequent with RIL than with clonidine or methyldopa. Indeed, the incidence of dry mouth and drowsiness during double-blind comparative trials versus clonidine and methyldopa was significantly lower with RIL.

Anti-heart antibody were found in sera of mice and myosin isoenzyme were changed during the course of EMC virus myocarditis. Atrial natriuretic polypeptide was markedly increased in the ventricles in these mice. Successive infection with coxsackievirus and EMC virus developed lesions similar to chronic myocarditis. The myocardial uptake of antimyosin antibody was proved to be a useful method of diagnosis of myocarditis. Treatment with the nucleoside analogue, ribavirin and recombinant alpha interferon effectively inhibited myocardial virus replication and reduced myocardial damage. Passive immunization and virus-specific vaccine prevented development of myocarditis. The use of immunosuppressive therapy was associated with greater mortality when administered early in illness and beneficial effects were not seen by later administration.

Cross-clamping of the thoracic aorta was associated with an expected increase in mean arterial pressure and systemic vascular resistance in all animals. During the period of cross-clamping, cardiac output gradually decreased in all groups. Animals pretreated with the alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist or the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor developed hypertension of a lesser degree than the control animals, while rats pretreated with the beta-adrenergic or alpha 2-adrenergic antagonist demonstrated a greater arterial hypertension than the control animals.

    "336": "This study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that, given equal arterial pressure reductions, the combination of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and calcium antagonist slows declines in renal function and yields greater reductions in albuminuria over either agent alone. This hypothesis was evaluated in four groups of hypertensive, non-insulin dependent, diabetic subjects with renal insufficiency (N = 30). Renal hemodynamics, albuminuria and metabolic parameters were evaluated for a period of one year. Subjects were all placed on a 90 mEq sodium, 0.8 g/kg protein, 1500 calorie American Diabetes Association diet for the entire length of the study. Subjects were followed for two weeks off antihypertensive medications and were subsequently randomized to either lisinopril, alone (group I), sustained release verapamil, alone (group II), reduced doses of both lisinopril and sustained release verapamil (group III), and hydrochlorothiazide with guanfacine (group IV). At the end of one year group III had the greatest reduction in albuminuria (78 +/- 7%, group III vs. 59% +/- 4, group I: P less than 0.05). In addition, the decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was the lowest in this group (0.28 +/- 0.07, group III vs. 0.69 +/- 0.12, group I; P less than 0.05) although there was no significant difference between groups II and IV. The highest side effect profiles were noted in group IV, the least in group III. The greatest reductions in renal hemodynamics occurred in all groups within the first month; however, striking differences between groups were noted (7.4 +/- 2%, group I vs. 1.4 +/- 2%, group III; P less than 0.05). We conclude that the combination of reduced doses of an ACE inhibitor and calcium antagonist attenuate both albuminuria and the rate of decline in glomerular filtration rate. Furthermore, the combination of these classes of agents appear to yield the lowest side effect profile over either agent alone. Lastly, high doses of ACE inhibition alone may be detrimental to renal function in late stage diabetics with renal insufficiency.",

Ramipril at a dose of 1 mg kg-1 day-1 for 6 weeks prevented the increase in blood pressure and development of LVH after aortic banding; plasma ACE activity was significantly inhibited. A lower dose of ramipril (10 micrograms kg-1 day-1 for 6 weeks) had no effect on the increase in blood pressure or on plasma ACE activity, but prevented LVH after aortic banding. The antihypertrophic effects of the higher and the lower dose ramipril, as well as the antihypertensive action of the higher dose of ramipril were abolished by the coadministration of HOE 140 (500 micrograms kg-1 day-1).

Intravenous (i.v.) administration of 6366 A at 30 micrograms/kg strongly inhibited angiotensin I-induced renal vasoconstrictive and pressor responses. 6366 A promptly lowered blood pressure and renal vascular resistance, and caused clear increases in renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate. It also increased urine volume and urinary excretion of sodium and chloride. These renal effects were also produced by intraduodenal (i.d.) administration of 2 mg/kg of imidapril. However, the effects of i.d. imidapril began later, developed gradually and reached a plateau after 2 to 3 h. Enalaprilat (30 micrograms/kg i.v.) and enalapril (2 mg/kg i.d.) had renal effects similar to 6366 A and imidapril.

Quantitative autoradiography, with the use of consecutive pituitary sections, allowed for simultaneous determination of changes in binding and in the potential AT synthetic ability of individual pituitaries, and for a correlation between these two phenomena. In the anterior pituitary, ACE activity and binding of the ACE inhibitor [125I]-351A were not changed during the estrous cycle. Ovariectomy produced a significant increase in ACE activity and binding, and both of these parameters returned to normal after estrogen replacement. There were no changes in ACE activity or binding in the posterior pituitary during the estrous cycle or after ovariectomy or hormone replacement. AT receptors were characterized as of the AT1 type, since they were displaced by the selective AT1 antagonist DuP 753 and not by the AT2 competitor PD 123177. There were marked changes in the concentration of AT1 receptors during the estrous cycle, with highest numbers in metestrus, lower in estrus and diestrus, and lowest during proestrus. Estrogen replacement in ovariectomized rats decreased AT1 receptor number in the anterior pituitary. Our results indicate a dual effect of estrogen on anterior pituitary AT, physiologically on AT receptor expression and pharmacologically on ACE activity.",

Inhibitor sensitivity of kidney angiotensin I-converting activity with captopril and lisonopril was similar in both groups.

In the enalapril treated group after three months the pressure in the wedged hepatic vein (25 +/- 4.8 vs. 21.3 4.8 mm Hg) and the pressure gradient wedged free hepatic vein (17.0 +/- 6.0 vs. 12.6 +/- 3.4 mm Hg) were significantly lower than the initial values (p less than less than 0.01) in the enalapril treated group. A very marked decline (greater than 3 mm Hg) of this pressure was recorded in 50% of the patients. In the group treated by sclerotherapy and placebo the pressure gradient did not decline. During treatment no changes in the systemic haemodynamics and liver tests occurred. None of the patients died during the investigation and the subsequent 6-month period.

    "346": "The separate catalytic roles of Zn2+ and Mg2+ and the specificity of the prenyl pyrophosphate-binding site of the rat brain protein farnesyltransferase were explored using a purified enzyme preparation. The binding of p21Hras to the enzyme was abolished by dialysis against EDTA and restored by addition of ZnCl2, as demonstrated by chemical cross-linking. The binding of the other substrate, farnesyl pyrophosphate, was independent of divalent cations, as demonstrated by gel filtration. Transfer of the enzyme-bound farnesyl group to the bound p21Hras required Mg2+. Geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate bound to the prenyl pyrophosphate-binding site with an affinity equal to that of farnesyl pyrophosphate, but the geranylgeranyl group was not transferred efficiently to p21Hras. It also was not transferred to a modified p21Hras containing COOH-terminal leucine, a protein that was shown previously to be a good substrate for a rat brain geranylgeranyltransferase. We conclude that the protein farnesyltransferase is a metalloenzyme that most likely contains Zn2+ at the peptide-binding site. It thus resembles certain metallopeptidases, including carboxypeptidase A and the angiotensin-converting enzyme. Strategies previously developed to screen for inhibitors of those enzymes may aid in the search for inhibitors of the protein farnesyltransferase.",

The concentration-response curve of resiniferatoxin was biphasic, yielding two EC50 values, one about 10,000 times lower than the other, the latter value being similar to that for capsaicin. The responses to resiniferatoxin, capsaicin or bradykinin were progressively reduced upon repeated application. The contraction evoked by either of the three compounds was not affected by thiorphan (an enkephalinase inhibitor) or captopril (an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor). Pretreatment with capsaicin concentration dependently reduced the contractile response to a subsequent application of resiniferatoxin and vice versa. Bradykinin pretreatment reduced the resiniferatoxin response by about 50%; resiniferatoxin pretreatment completely abolished the response to bradykinin. Also, the contractile response to electrical stimulation was reduced concentration dependently by resiniferatoxin, capsaicin and bradykinin pretreatment. The response to electrical stimulation could be completely abolished by pretreatment with large doses of resiniferatoxin or capsaicin; pretreatment with large doses of bradykinin reduced the response by about 50%. Pretreatment with high concentrations of resiniferatoxin, or capsaicin, but not bradykinin, reduced the contractile response to the NK1 receptor agonist, [Sar9, Met(O2)11]SP (10(-8) M). The results suggest that the three compounds produce tachyphylaxis, mainly through partial (bradykinin) or complete (capsaicin, resiniferatoxin) exhaustion of the neuronal pool of releasable tachykinins although desensitization of tachykinin receptors may also contribute.",

Chronic treatment with enalapril markedly and dose dependently enhanced the number of capsaicin-induced coughs. However, chronic treatment with hydrochlorothiazide significantly reduced the number of coughs associated with enalapril treatment, also in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that diuretics might be used to reduce the coughing associated with treatment with inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme in patients with hypertension.",

At the end of each treatment period cerebral blood flow (CBF) was assessed by single proton emission, computed tomography, using 99m-Tc-exametazime. In the 20 patients who completed the study, supine BP was lowered from 194/106 to 167/90 mmHg (p less than 0.001/0.001) by E and from 185/104 to 172/91 (p less than 0.01/0.001) by CCB.

Although there were great interpatient differences in CBF, the individual pattern remained unaltered by either E or CCB and mean quantitative changes were not significant. We conclude that in elderly hypertensives both E and CCB effectively lower BP, while cerebral perfusion is not adversely affected by either.", 
    "354": "To compare the benefit of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and direct vasodilation on the prognosis of advanced heart failure, 117 patients evaluated for cardiac transplantation who had severe symptoms and abnormal hemodynamic status at rest were randomized to treatment with either captopril or hydralazine plus isosorbide dinitrate (Hy-C Trial). Comparable hemodynamic effects of the two regimens were sought by titrating vasodilator doses to match the hemodynamic status achieved with nitroprusside and diuretic agents, attempting to achieve a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 15 mm Hg and a systemic vascular resistance of 1,200 dynes.s.cm-5. Treatment with the alternate vasodilator was started because of poor hemodynamic response or side effects (40% of patients in the captopril group and 22% in the hydralazine group). Adequate hemodynamic response in patients with a serum sodium level less than 135 mg/dl was more likely with hydralazine than with captopril (71% vs. 33%, p = 0.04). Isosorbide dinitrate was prescribed in 88% of the hydralazine-treated patients and 84% of the captopril-treated patients. The hemodynamic improvements from each regimen were equivalent. After 8 +/- 7 months of follow-up, the actuarial 1-year survival rate was 81% in the captopril-treated patients and 51% in the hydralazine-treated patients (p = 0.05). The improved survival with captopril resulted from a lower rate of sudden death, which occurred in only 3 of 44 captopril-treated patients compared with 17 of 60 hydralazine-treated patients (p = 0.01). In the subset of patients who continued treatment with the initial vasodilator, results were similar to those for the entire treatment group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "355": "The effects of captopril and digoxin treatment on left ventricular remodeling and function after anterior myocardial infarction were evaluated in a randomized unblinded trial. Fifty-two patients with a first transmural anterior myocardial infarction and a radionuclide left ventricular ejection fraction less than 40% were randomly assigned to treatment with captopril (Group A) or digoxin (Group B). The two groups had similar baseline hemodynamic, coronary angiographic, echocardiographic and radionuclide angiographic variables. Among the 40 patients (20 in each group) who were followed up for 1 year, echocardiographic end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes were unmodified in Group A and global wall motion index was improved (p less than 0.01); in Group B, end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes increased (p less than 0.001 for both) and global wall motion index was unchanged. Rest radionuclide ejection fraction increased significantly in both groups (p less than 0.001, Group A; p less than 0.005, Group B). A comparison of the changes in the considered variables between the two groups after 1 year of treatment showed a difference in end-diastolic (p less than 0.005) end-systolic volumes (p less than 0.001) and global wall motion index (p less than 0.005) without differences in radionuclide ejection fraction, which improved to a similar degree in both groups. The results of this study suggest that captopril therapy, started 7 to 10 days after symptom onset in patients with anterior myocardial infarction and an ejection fraction less than 40%, improves both left ventricular remodeling and function and prevents left ventricular enlargement and in these patients performs better than digitalis.", 
    "356": "We examined whether the renal protective effect of the angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) is dose-related and associated with alterations in the urinary excretion of prostaglandin (PG) E2 and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, a stable breakdown product of prostacyclin. Enalapril maleate at 1.5, 5 and 15 mg/kg/day or vehicle was chronically administered to saline-drinking SHRSP (six per group) starting at 8.1 weeks of age. Vehicle-treated SHRSP developed severe hypertension, proteinuria and strokes (age at death, 14 +/- 1 weeks; mean +/- S.E.). Enalapril prolonged survival dose-dependently and reduced proteinuria; all SHRSP given 15 mg/kg/day lived beyond 23 weeks of age without evidence of stroke or proteinuria. There was no effect of enalapril at any dose on systolic arterial blood pressure in spite of variable levels of urinary protein excretion and onset of stroke in the different groups. Likewise, urinary 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and PGE2 excretion did not differ among the groups except for an increase in 6-keto-PGF1 alpha in the 15 mg/kg/day group at one week after initiation of enalapril therapy. These results are consistent with a dose-related renal protective action of enalapril in saline-drinking SHRSP that is not closely associated with sustained alterations in urinary excretion of renal vasodilatory PGs.", 
    "357": "Nitric oxide (NO) contribution to the renal hemodynamic effect of lisinopril was assessed in anesthetized rabbits. NG-Nitro-L-arginine (NArg), slightly decreased renal blood flow following vehicle. Also, NArg reversed partially the increase in renal blood flow caused by DuP 753, and almost completely reversed the effect of lisinopril. The results suggest that NO plays an important role in the renal hemodynamic effect of lisinopril, more so than its contribution to the effect of DuP 753.", 
    "358": "The renin angiotensin system is activated during anaesthesia and operation, and the degree to which this activation takes place depends on the hydration and circulation of the patient. The anaesthetic agent used is also important for the activation. Treatment with ACE-inhibitors blunts or abolishes the sympathetic response to anaesthesia/operation. ACEI treatment reduces the need for other hypotensive agents in controlled hypotensive anaesthesia. Some studies suggest that ACEI-treatment should be continued peroperatively on account of its stabilising effect on the circulation to avoid sudden fluctuations in blood pressure and organ perfusion. On the other hand measurements of the cerebral blood flow under anaesthesia in patients treated with ACEI have shown low values in a few patients and this led the authors to recommend discontinuation before anaesthesia. We conclude that controlled clinical trials to evaluate the haemodynamic and neurohumoral consequences of the interaction between ACEI and anaesthetics are required.",

Cardiovascular effects of opioid peptide products of proenkephalin, [Met] enkephalin (ME), [Leu] enkephalin (LE), [Met] enkephalyl Arg6-Phe7 (MEAP) and [Met] enkephalyl Arg6-Gly7-Leu8 (MEAGL) have been studied in urethane-anaesthetised rats. 2. ME, LE, MEAP and MEAGL produced vasodepression and bradycardia mediated by mu-opioid receptors. 3. Atypical responses to MEAP were observed in a quarter of the animals studied showing tachycardia and pressor effects. This response was probably due to the release of the dipeptide Arg-Phe which exerted its effects at sympathetic ganglia. 4. Studies with the peptidase inhibitors captopril and bestatin showed a differential potentiation of the cardiovascular effects of the proenkephalin products by inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme and aminopeptidase. 5. The effects of vagotomy, pithing and studies with atropine, and N-methyl levallorphan were used to demonstrate that, for all four proenkephalin peptides, cardiovascular effects were mediated by peripheral opioid receptors and transmission to the CNS via vagal afferents.",

The efficacy sample included 1267 patients: at therapy week 14, 78.6% of patients were treated with quinapril alone. Global response rate (intent-to-treat) was 83.3%, with a mean reduction of diastolic pressure of 15.8 mmHg (95% confidence interval from 15.5 to 16.2 mmHg). 91 patients reported 126 associated adverse events (7.0%); the most frequently reported event was cough (2.7%).

    "361": "The purpose of this research was a retrospective evaluation of the mortality rate in 138 patients, considered after the first hospitalisation due to heart failure. After 5 years, the mortality rate was higher in the 54 patients with dilatative cardiomyopathy (74.3%), compared to the 44 patients with coronary heart disease (54.5%), while the 40 patients with valvular heart disease showed a lower mortality (37.5%). The mortality rate was higher in patients admitted in higher NYHA class. The primary aim of this research was to assess the effects of captopril on mortality in 101 treated patients, compared to 37 non treated patients, both receiving conventional treatment for heart failure. Between the 2 groups, the mortality rate showed lower percentage values for patients treated with captopril, with significant difference (p less than 0.01) at controls carried out every 12 months, until 5 years. Progressive heart failure was the greater cause of death in both groups, while the deaths classified as due to arrhythmia without pump failure were less frequent. Deaths due to reinfarction in patients with coronary heart disease showed lesser percentage values in patients treated with captopril. This research demonstrated the high mortality rate affecting a group of patients after the first hospitalisation due to heart failure. The addition of captopril to conventional treatment for heart failure significantly reduced mortality.", 
    "362": "Early in the acute phase of myocardial infarction the phenomenon of expansion may occur, with regional thinning and dilatation of necrotic region. This complication may be detected by echocardiography since the first hours of infarction. During the two subsequent weeks, an additional increase of left ventricular volume may occur, due to an increase of length of the infarcted segments and, as well, of the contractile segments which suffer a \"volume overload hypertrophy\". This is the phenomenon of remodeling. Finally during the first year post infarction, a progressive left ventricular dilatation may develop. This late dilatation seems to be due to an increase of perimeter of the contractile regions only. By the time this topographic changes have occurred, the left ventricle assumes a more spheric configuration. Left ventricular dilatation affects adversely cardiac function, with higher incidences of heart failure and death. Experimental and clinical studies show that, in selected patients, remodeling and ventricular dilatation may be attenuated by the administration of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, with better indices of left ventricular function. Final results of several on-going multicenter studies are awaited for; they will allow a better definition of the role of ACE inhibitors on prevention and treatment of left ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction.",

This case illustrates that such complications can occur late during the course of treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. It is therefore important that both the renal function and plasma potassium are closely monitored in such patients even if these parameters are normal at the beginning of therapy.",

In the following case report, we describe the successful diagnosis of renovascular hypertension in a 13-year-old girl by using color-encoded doppler sonography and Captopril renal scintigraphy. The patient was admitted with hypertension of 180/130 mmHg. Laboratory findings showed elevated plasma renin and aldosterone concentrations. No abnormalities were found by abdominal sonography, isotope renography, intravenous pyelography, or in venous digital subtraction angiography. However, subsequent color-encoded doppler sonography clearly showed evidence of an artery stenosis of the right kidney. Furthermore, isotope renography one hour after oral administration of captopril revealed an almost complete loss of glomerular filtration rate of the right kidney. Based on these findings, arterial digital subtraction angiography, including transluminal angioplasty, was performed. During this treatment procedure, the right renal artery stenosis could be confirmed and was subsequently dilated without complication. In the following twelve months the patient remained normotensive and required no further antihypertensive drug treatment.",

Twenty 25-mg captopril tablets were crushed separately, added to 25 mL of tap water in individual volumetric flasks, and shaken vigorously. Five flasks each were incubated at 25, 50, and 75 degrees C in a shaking water bath and refrigerated at 5 degrees C. Samples were taken from each flask immediately after dissolving the drug and at intervals up to 28 days for 5 and 25 degrees C, 15 days for 50 degrees C, and 16 days for 75 degrees C. Captopril concentrations were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. First-order rate constants were calculated for each temperature setting, and the Arrhenius plot was applied to estimate the shelf life of captopril at 5 degrees C. More than 90% of the initial concentration of captopril remained after 28 days at 5 degrees C. Captopril concentration in the samples stored at 75, 50, and 25 degrees C decreased to 90% of the initial concentration at calculated times (mean +/- S.E.) of 2.1 +/- 0.1, 3.6 +/- 0.4, and 11.8 +/- 1.2 days, respectively. The estimated time required for the concentration of a 1-mg/mL solution of captopril stored at 5 degrees C to decrease to 90% of initial concentration was 27 days. The shelf life of a solution of captopril 1 mg/mL in tap water stored at 5 degrees C was 27 days.", 
    "367": "The prognosis of patients with advanced chronic cardiac failure is very poor. Only investigations made in recent years provided evidence that this adverse prognosis can be influenced by conservative pharmacological treatment. Among many tested vasodilating substances positive data were obtained only with high doses of nitrates with hydralazine and in particular with inhibitors of the angiotensin converting enzyme which are the greatest advance in the treatment of chronic cardiac failure. Preparations of this group mitigate the symptomatology, increase load tolerance and improve the prognosis. So far they are indicated above all in severe forms of cardiac failure, however, the possibility to use them also in milder forms and in patients with myocardial infarction is intensively investigated. The basis of pharmacological treatment remain diuretics. The position of digitalis in the treatment of cardiac failure is revised at present; in a major proportion of patients, in particular those with a preserved sinus rhythm, its administration is useless. A number of other positively inotropic substances was tested, catecholamines as well as phosphodiesterase inhibitors (amrinone, milrinone, xamoterol, enoximone). Contrary to acute failure, their effect in chronic failure is controversial, data on an improved prognosis are lacking and some investigations reveal an adverse trend. Almost half the patients with cardiac failure die from a sudden death and it would thus be logical to use antiarrhythmic drugs. Here, too, however, data on an improved diagnosis are lacking. The results of hitherto accomplished studies were rather disappointing, the investigation with the most promising antiarrhythmic agent--amiodarone--is still under way.", 
    "368": "Conditional probability procedures offer a flexible means of performing sequential analysis of clinical trials. Since these procedures are not based on repeated significance test, the number and schedule of the interim analyses is less important than with group sequential procedures. Their main disadvantage is that the magnitude of their effect on the significance level is difficult to assess. This paper describes a conditional probability procedure which attempts to maintain the overall significance level by balancing the probabilities of false early rejection and false early acceptance. Monte Carlo sampling results suggest that this procedure can achieve a large reduction in expected sample size without greatly affecting either the significance level or power of the trial.", 
    "369": "Acute hemodynamics of pimobendan were compared to captopril in a crossover trial in patients with chronic heart failure (NYHA II-III). Heart failure had been stabilized by conventional therapy with diuretics and digitalis for more than 2 weeks. Patients receiving vasodilators were excluded. The hemodynamics were analyzed using a Swan-Ganz catheter at the bedside during drug administration. Following an intravenous injection of 2.5 mg of pimobendan, there was a significant increase in heart rate and decrease in mean pulmonary artery pressure, total pulmonary resistance, mean arterial pressure, systemic vascular resistance and mean right atrial pressure 2 hours after the injection. Captopril (12.5 mg, orally) significantly decreased mean arterial pressure, systemic vascular resistance and double product 2 hours after administration. In this study, the inotropic effect was evaluated through the relation between the stroke volume index and diastolic pulmonary artery pressure, and also between the stroke volume index and mean arterial pressure. Although decreases of diastolic pulmonary artery pressure and mean arterial pressure were seen with both drugs, the differences in stroke volume index were not significant. In comparison with captopril, the acute hemodynamics of pimobendan are characterized as follows: 1) the systemic arteriovasodilating effects of the two drugs were equal, 2) the pulmonary arteriovasodilating effect of pimobendan was marked, 3) a venodilating effect, documented through a decrease of mean right atrial pressure, was seen only with pimobendan. This study concluded that pimobendan is a stronger arterio-venodilator than captopril.",

Partially nephrectomized rats were studied at 2 and 8 weeks post-surgery before the development of systemic hypertension. At 2 weeks, nephrectomized rats had a numerically higher tubular stop-flow pressure than controls (43 +/- 2 mmHg vs. 38 +/- 2 mmHg; P = 0.08) and a higher post- to pre-glomerular resistance ratio (Re/Ra) (0.40 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.31 +/- 0.03; P = 0.08). At 8 weeks, stop-flow pressure and post- to pre-glomerular resistance ratios were similar in remnant and intact kidneys.

This increase in stop-flow pressure was associated with an increase in the post- to pre-glomerular resistance ratio (0.33 +/- 0.02-0.42 +/- 0.02, P = 0.009). Stop-flow pressure was positively correlated with the post- to pre-glomerular resistance ratio in 2-week post-surgery nephrectomized rats and their respective controls when combined (r = 0.89, P = 0.0001) and 8-week post-surgery nephrectomized rats and their respective controls combined (r = 0.78, P = 0.0001).

    "371": "The effect of kininase II inhibitor, enalapril, on the delivery of monoclonal antibody A7 to the targeted tumor was investigated using athymic mice bearing human colon cancer, SW1116. Enalapril alone, which enhances tumor vascular permeability through the kinin-generating cascade, did not increase the uptake of 125I-labeled A7 (125I-A7) in SW1116 due to the systemic hypotension induced by its inhibitory effect on angiotensin converting enzyme. However, with combined angiotensin II (AT-II) and enalapril treatment, a 2-fold increase in the accumulation of 125I-A7 was seen when compared to A7 alone. This marked increase was presumably due to increased tumor vascular permeability induced by enalapril combined with the absence of hypotension due to the actions of AT-II. This approach might be useful in radioimmunodetection and immunotargeting chemotherapy using monoclonal antibody.",

In one patient, it was demonstrated that the discontinuation of enalapril was followed by a decrease in renal blood flow and a significant increase in the plasma erythropoietin levels that preceded the rise in hemoglobin. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition may cause anemia by increasing renal blood flow and consequently decreasing erythropoietin levels.", 
    "373": "Perindopril is a non-sulphydryl angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor which requires hydrolysis to its active metabolite, perindoprilat, to produce its effects. Ten cirrhotic patients with mild to severe disease were studied after oral administration of a single 8 mg dose of perindopril as its tert-butylamine salt. Compared with a historical control group of young healthy volunteers receiving the same single oral dose of perindopril, mean AUC values of the prodrug perindopril were double in patients with liver cirrhosis (602 +/- 294 s.d. ng ml-1 h vs 266 +/- 70 s.d. ng ml-1 h) whereas the mean AUC of perindoprilat was found to be similar (134 +/- 139 ng ml-1 h vs 120 +/- 29 ng ml-1 h). The partial metabolic clearance of perindopril to perindoprilat was much lower in the cirrhotics (26 +/- 12 ml min-1 vs 58 +/- 22 ml min-1). The maximum inhibition of plasma ACE activity measured in the cirrhotic patients (87.5 +/- 5.1%) was comparable with that previously reported with perindopril in patients with mild hepatic impairment as well as in patients with essential hypertension. We suggest that liver cirrhosis may be associated with imparied deesterification of perindopril to its active metabolite perindoprilat but that no dosage adjustment of perindopril is required in cirrhotic patients.",

The relaxation is mediated by endothelial B2 bradykinin receptors, the contraction through B1 bradykinin receptors. Converting-enzyme inhibitors induced a weak potentiation of the contractile response and weak or no potentiation of the endothelium-dependent relaxation. In the presence of indomethacin, the response to bradykinin was not modified and no potentiation from the inhibitor could be observed. Blockade of the contractile response with a B1 bradykinin antagonist did not unmask a potentiation of the bradykinin endothelium-dependent relaxation by the converting-enzyme inhibitors. However, in the presence of B2 bradykinin antagonist, when high concentrations of bradykinin are required to induce relaxation, converting-enzyme inhibitors potentiated the effects of bradykinin. In contrast, in bioassay conditions with a perfused vascular segment, converting-enzyme inhibitors selectively enhanced the release of EDRF by bradykinin. This effect is observed in the bioassay tissue and in the donor segment. These results suggest that converting enzyme is indeed a powerful modulator of bradykinin action and that other enzymatic pathways of bradykinin metabolism present in the vascular wall could mask its action.",

Anionic immunoglobulin clearance (IgG4) was compared with that of total immunoglobulins, which have the same size but are mostly cationic, and of albumin. Ten type I hypertensive diabetic patients (group 1), 10 type 2 hypertensive diabetic patients (group 2), 5 type 1 normotensive diabetic patients (group 3), 10 subjects with essential hypertension (group 4), and 7 normal volunteers (group 5) received an intravenous injection of captopril (25 mg/100 ml in 5 min). Twelve of the hypertensive diabetic patients underwent a second provocative test with clonidine (150 micrograms/100 ml) (group 6) or placebo (100 ml saline) (group 7) with the same procedure. None of the patients had clinical nephropathy or other disorders. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal plasma flow (RPF) were measured before and during the tests. A significant decrease in diastolic blood pressure was observed in groups 1, 2, 4, and 6, together with an increase in the GFR and RPF values in groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 only, as well as a decrease in renal vascular resistances in groups 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. Both clearances and fractional clearances of IgG4 and IgG decreased after captopril in groups 1 and 2.2+ The decrease in IgG4 clearance was correlated to that of renal vascular resistances in group 1 patients. A significant decrease in the anionic-cationic immunoglobulin ratio (IgG4/IgG) was observed in groups 1, 2, and 3.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "389": "To evaluate the role of glomerular hypertension, glomerular hypertrophy, glomerular lipid deposition, and plasma cholesterol levels in diabetic glomerulopathy, Munich-Wistar rats received streptozocin and daily insulin injections and were assigned to one of three groups: untreated diabetic (DMC), hydralazine-treated diabetic (DMH), and enalapril-treated diabetic (DME). Age-matched control rats were also studied. At 6-10 wk of diabetes, DMC rats showed marked elevations of glomerular pressure and glomerular filtration rate as well as slight glomerular enlargement and cholesterol elevation. DMH and DME rats exhibited arterial hypotension but no change in cholesterol or glomerular volume. Glomerular pressure was normalized by enalapril but not by hydralazine treatment. Additional rats were followed up to 12 mo of diabetes. Slight hypertension was seen in DMC rats, whereas sustained hypotension occurred in DMH and DME rats. Progressive albuminuria occurred in DMC and DMH but not in DME rats. At 12 mo, glomerular hypertension persisted in DMC and DMH rats but was still absent in DME rats. Cholesterol was elevated in DMC and slightly lower in DMH and DME rats. Glomeruli were equally enlarged in the diabetic groups. Glomerular sclerotic lesions and lipid deposits appeared in DMC and DMH but not in DME rats. These findings are consistent with the notion that glomerular hypertension may promote glomerular injury in experimental diabetes. Glomerular lipid deposition may also participate in this process, although a causal relationship was not demonstrated. Glomerular hypertrophy and cholesterol were unrelated to glomerular injury, although they may have exacerbated hemodynamically mediated damage.",

Streptozocin-induced diabetic (STZ-D) rats were studied with micropuncture (MP) technique after 10-15 days of diabetes (daily blood glucose level 15.3-18 mmol). We also studied STZ-D rats treated with the converting-enzyme inhibitor (CEI) enalapril or the angiotensin II (ANG II) receptor antagonist DuP 753 (DuP) for 3 days before MP. Nondiabetic rats (NOR) served as controls. Glomerular hemodynamics and proximal tubular reabsorption were measured in the control period and during intravenous glycine infusion. In NOR rats, glycine increased single-nephron plasma flow (SNPF) and single-nephron glomerular filtration rate (SNGFR). Although STZ-D rats did not exhibit hyperfiltration, SNGFR and SNPF were not modified by glycine, defining loss of RFR. CEI rats responded to glycine with an increase in SNGFR due to a rise in SNPF and a rise in the ultrafiltration coefficient. Interestingly, loss of RFR in STZ-D rats was associated with a decrease in absolute proximal reabsorption. The decrease in absolute proximal reabsorption was corrected by both CEI and DuP, although glomerular vasodilation was restored only in the CEI group. In conclusion, at the early stage of diabetes mellitus, loss of RFR does not detect hyperfiltration, but rather the presence of a tubular alteration probably dependent on ANG II.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "391": "Hypertension is quite common in the elderly population. Isolated systolic hypertension and diastolic hypertension are associated with cardiovascular complications. Like younger patients, the elderly may have labile hypertension. On the other hand, pseudohypertension, auscultatory gap, and postural hypotension are peculiar to the elderly. Obesity, atherosclerosis, arteriosclerosis, baroreceptor insensitivity, decline in renal function, physical inactivity, and insomnia are factors that can lead to or aggravate hypertension in older patients. Secondary hypertension should be suspected if elevated blood pressure first appears late in life or becomes resistant to previously adequate treatment. Spontaneous hypokalemia can indicate primary aldosteronism. Elevation in the serum creatinine level of a patient taking an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor suggests bilateral renovascular hypertension. The goal of antihypertensive therapy is to prevent morbidity, disability, and death from complications and to maintain quality of life. Psychosocial factors may play an important role in controlling hypertension. Nonpharmacologic treatment, such as weight loss, salt restriction, and exercise, should always be tried prior to and in conjunction with medical therapy. Antihypertensive drugs often cause side effects and should be prescribed with caution. Always start with a low dose and gradually increase it if necessary. All drugs that reduce blood pressure in the younger individual also work in the elderly. ACE inhibitors and calcium blockers are particularly useful because of their low incidence of adverse effects.",

At their initial presentation, 94% of these patients manifested signs and symptoms of angioedema in the head and neck; three of them required urgent tracheotomy or intubation. As treatment of complement-mediated angioedema is distinct, an etiology-specific diagnostic and treatment protocol is presented. Of the patients, 35% had recent initiation of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy for hypertension, and 6% demonstrated classic hereditary angioedema. However, the majority of them (59%) had unclear etiologies for their symptoms. Since angioedema is the final result of several possible abnormalities, a thorough knowledge of the differential diagnosis and clinical presentation is vital to patient management.",

Measurements were done 3 hours after a single dose treatment. Furosemide (20 mg/kg) produced a marked diuresis and tachycardia with no change in blood pressure; in comparison with control rats, furosemide-treated rats had total peripheral vascular resistance increased by 46.55% (p less than 0.01) and local vascular resistance increased in most organs, to a significant degree in the spleen, muscle, stomach, intestine, and skin (p less than 0.05 to 0.01).

Total peripheral and local vascular resistances in several tissues were significantly lower in both the Dup 753 and enalapril groups than in the furosemide group. In particular, both antiangiotensin agents, in contrast to furosemide, produced significant decrease in renal vascular resistance by 42.28% and 38.81%, respectively (p less than 0.01), with a tendency to increase the renal blood flow (of the intact kidney).

Autotransplantation of the left kidney to the right iliac fossa with contralateral nephrectomy was done in female mongrel dogs. One group served as controls (n = 6). A second group underwent constriction of the external diameter of the renal artery at the time of the operation to produce renal artery stenosis (n = 7). At two weeks postoperatively, glomerular filtration rate was significantly lower in the renal artery stenosis group (26.2 +/- 3.4 ml./min. vs. 38.2 +/- 3.2 ml./min., p less than 0.05), and deteriorated further after captopril administration (17.9 +/- 2.7 ml./min. vs. 26.2 +/- 3.4 ml./min., p less than 0.05). Despite the presence of hemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis, mean arterial pressure was not different between the two groups (134 +/- 4 mm. Hg vs. 132 +/- 6 mm.

Serial hemodynamic as well as topographic and functional variables (two-dimensional echocardiography) were measured over 6 weeks.

Infarct scar mass, transmurality and collagen content at 6 weeks were similar in the two groups but scars showed less (p less than 0.001) thinning and expansion with captopril than with placebo. Echocardiograms showed similar infarct expansion and thinning in the two groups at 2 days but less aneurysm with captopril at 6 weeks.

    "396": "The goal of the present study was to compare the hemodynamic and biochemical effects of the renin inhibitor Ro 42-5892, the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor cilazapril, and the angiotensin II receptor blocker EXP132, the aldehyde derivative of DuP 753. The three drugs were evaluated in guinea pigs, previously treated with furosemide, using their maximal effective doses. Cilazapril decreased arterial blood pressure more than Ro 42-5892 and EXP132. In contrast, Ro 42-5892 and EXP132 had similar effects. The larger decrease of arterial pressure induced by cilazapril was not due to a larger decrease of angiotensin II in plasma and was not influenced by cyclooxygenase inhibition with indomethacin or by bradykinin antagonism with Hoe 140. After binephrectomy, most of the blood pressure-lowering effect of Ro 42-5892 disappeared. In contrast, cilazapril was still markedly effective, pointing to extrarenal effects. We conclude that in furosemide-treated guinea pigs, as opposed to previously published animal models, the decrease of arterial pressure induced by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors may be partly due to extrarenal effects not related to the renin-angiotensin system.",

Although it did not affect the systemic hemodynamic parameters, zabicipril induced a strong peripheral vasodilation, significantly reducing brachial, carotid, and femoral resistances and increasing the corresponding blood flows from 3 or 4 1/2 hours to 9 hours. This vasodilation affected only the arterioles, not the large arteries, and resulted in a redistribution of cardiac output toward the three regional vascular beds. Zabicipril induced an early, potent, and long-lasting converting enzyme inhibition. Furthermore, zabicipril did not affect plasma catecholamines and atrial natriuretic factor.",

Sodium excretion was detected only if ACE had been blocked. In both series of experiments, an increase in chloride excretion was found to be statistically significant. A conclusion has been made that PGE2 influences directly the inhibition of acid excretory function of the kidneys.",

There were 13 patients in this group who had their trial drug switched after a certain period to allow direct but blind comparison between placebo and enalapril. Cardiac mortality with enalapril was 32 per cent compared to 48 per cent with placebo at intervals after initiating therapy of 20.0 +/- 19.4 versus 14.3 +/- 11.5 months respectively. When compared to a preceding control period, 80 per cent of the enalapril patients improved in contrast to 21 per cent of the placebo. However, when a comparison was made directly between enalapril and placebo, enalapril was better in 31 per cent and placebo was better in 8 per cent of the patients. It is concluded that in certain patients with systolic heart failure from non-valvular and non-hypertensive causes, enalapril is beneficial when added to the conventional treatment. An argument is also presented that to cost-effectively identify the group who will benefit, a short term ACE-I trial after the conventional antifailure therapy can be considered in all patients with systolic heart failure.",

Intravenous digital subtraction angiography is now performed in all patients with progressive, drug-resistant hypertension associated with aorto-iliac lesions or with renal impairment induced by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Yet the finding of hypertension with renal artery stenosis is not enough to make the diagnosis of renovascular hypertension, this term being reserved to hypertension reversible by revascularization. The selection of patients who may benefit from revascularization rests on urography to explore the excretory and endocrine functions of the ischaemic kidney, as well as on scintigraphy and measurement of renin levels in renal veins before and after administration of captopril. The functional data are completed by vascular exploration which helps in evaluating the usefulness and safety of revascularization: repercussions of hypertension on target organs and extension of the vascular disease to other territories. Revascularization as first-line treatment consists of percutaneous transluminal dilatation; surgery must be reserved to difficult cases, such as arterial obliteration or failed dilatation.",

This study examined whether brain and atrial natriuretic peptides (BNP, ANP) are secreted together through the coronary sinus from the heart, and whether plasma concentrations of BNP and ANP were affected by ergometric exercise in patients with essential hypertension. The effects of temocapril, a potent angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, on plasma concentrations of these peptides was also examined. 2. The plasma concentrations of immunoreactive (ir) BNP and ir-ANP in the coronary sinus in seven patients with ischaemic heart disease during cardiac catheterization were far greater than values with plasma obtained at the same time from the femoral artery. 3. The plasma concentrations of ir-BNP and ir-ANP increased with exercise and were correlated with each other. Temocapril reduced the blood pressure and slightly (but significantly) decreased the levels of both peptides at rest and during exercise. 4. The results suggest that BNP and ANP were secreted together through the coronary sinus from the heart. The secretion was increased by exercise and suppressed by acute ACE inhibition. The increase in these peptides during exercise may reflect a compensatory mechanism against further elevation of blood pressure.",

Mean blood pressure and plasma aldosterone, cortisol and vasopressin concentrations were not modified by this treatment, while plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma angiotensin I concentrations increased significantly. The same parameters were studied using a constant intravenous 30 min-infusion of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) (0.1 micrograms.kg-1min-1). This dose of ANP infused to anesthetized guinea-pigs induced a significant decrease in mean blood pressure (about -20%) in control and in perindopril treated animals. In ANP infused animals, plasma aldosterone and cortisol concentrations decreased similarly in both groups by about -50%, whereas plasma vasopressin concentrations increased in controls (+169%) but not in perindopril treated guinea-pigs. An increase in PRA and plasma angiotensin I concentrations was observed in both groups after the infusion of ANP. Thus, when ANP demonstrated an potent hypotensive effect a concomitant increase in PRA occurred. The rise observed in vasopressin concentration in control animals was probably mediated by angiotensin II. The fall in plasma aldosterone and cortisol concentrations observed after ANP infusion demonstrated a direct potent action of ANP at the adrenal levels.", 
    "407": "Seven-month-old, lean male SHHF/Mcc-cp rats, a model of spontaneous hypertension, progressive renal dysfunction, and congestive heart failure (CHF), were treated with either clonidine (CL) or enalapril (EN) or received no treatment (CON) for 20 weeks. CL significantly decreased systolic blood pressure (SBP), kidney weights, and severity of renal lesions as compared with untreated CON. EN produced a decrease in SBP comparable to that in CL. Kidney weights and severity of renal histologic changes in the EN group were intermediate between those of the CL and CON groups. Despite similar plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) concentrations, CL treatment resulted in a significant increase in the density of guanylate cyclase-linked glomerular ANP receptors, whereas EN treatment resulted in a significant decrease in the total number of ANP receptors and in the number of nonguanylate cyclase-linked receptors and an increase in overall binding affinity. These findings demonstrate that antihypertensive agents will slow progression of renal injury in SHHF/Mcc-cp rats and that CL is more effective than EN in alleviating progressive kidney damage in this model. Furthermore, different classes of antihypertensive drugs may alter the density or ratio of biologically active and clearance ANP receptor sites in the glomerulus.", 
    "408": "To test whether quinaprilat, a new angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, has any venous effect, we measured its immediate effects on mean circulatory filling pressure (MCFP), intravascular volume, and total body vascular (i.e., venous) compliance in conscious rats with healed myocardial infarction induced by coronary artery ligation. MCFP was determined by inflating a right atrial balloon to arrest the circulation instantly and temporarily. Total body vascular compliance was derived from total circulatory pressure-volume relationships as determined by series measurements of MCFP with different intravascular volume status. In 8 rats with mean infarct size of 26 +/- 4%, 30-min infusion of quinaprilat (0.1 mg/kg/min) decreased both mean arterial and central venous pressures (MAP, CVP) by 8 and 0.7 mm Hg, respectively (p less than 0.02); heart rate (HR), MCFP, hematocrit, and blood volume remained unchanged. As compared with control vehicle infusion, quinaprilat increased total body vascular compliance (2.09 +/- 0.12 vs. 2.69 +/- 0.23 ml/kg/mm Hg; p less than 0.05) and decreased extrapolated unstressed circulating volume (34.96 +/- 1.10 vs. 28.53 +/- 2.55 ml/kg; p less than 0.02). These data suggest that quinaprilat produces possible venodilation through improved total body vascular compliance, thereby reducing cardiac preload in this rat model of myocardial infarction.", 
    "409": "In a blind, randomized study, the effects of perindopril, a nonsulfhydryl-containing angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, were compared with those of placebo in a closed-chest pig model of myocardial infarction. In anesthetized pigs, myocardial ischemia and reperfusion were induced by inflation and deflation of a catheter balloon in the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD), respectively. Thirty minutes after induction of ischemia and 15 min before reperfusion, a bolus injection of 0.06 mg/kg perindoprilat (n = 12), the active compound of perindopril, or placebo (n = 12) was administered in the pulmonary artery of these animals. After the acute phase of myocardial infarction, treatment with 12 mg/day perindopril or placebo was continued orally for 2 weeks. During the entire treatment period, 7 of 12 animals died in the placebo group versus 2 of 12 animals in the perindopril group (Fisher's exact test p less than 0.04). This beneficial effect of perindopril on mortality could not be attributed to salvage of myocardial tissue because the increases in creatine phosphokinase and coronary venous purine levels were similar in perindopril- and placebo-treated animals. Neither were there any significant between-treatment differences in the hemodynamic and (neuro)humoral parameters during the acute phase of myocardial infarction. The difference in mortality was observed within 24 h after myocardial infarction. Prevention of acute pump failure and, especially, life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias may explain this improvement in survival by perindopril. Retrospectively, logistic regression analysis showed that, irrespective of treatment, survival was inversely correlated to plasma renin activity (PRA) before induction of ischemia (r = -0.33; p less than 0.02).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "410": "Among the interventions designed to limit postischemic oxidative injury, those that enhance the myocardial content of thiol groups are attractive because thiols are powerful antioxidant. Indeed, part of the protection afforded by the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril in regional myocardial ischemia is attributed to its thiol group. This study assesses the effects of captopril in a surgically relevant model of global ischemic arrest. Thirty rats were implanted subcutaneously (s.c.) with osmotic pumps that allowed continuous delivery of captopril (total dose 75 mg), enalapril (a nonthiol-containing ACE inhibitor, total dose 7.5 mg) or saline in 48 h. Drug concentrations were equipotent in their effect on angiotensin I (ANGI) pressor response. Hearts were then excised, perfused under isovolumic conditions, and subjected to 90-min cardioplegic arrest at 30 degrees C followed by 1-h reperfusion. Pre- and postischemic coronary flows were significantly higher to a similar extent in the two drug-pretreated groups than in controls. However, captopril-pretreated hearts had the best recovery of contractility (dP/dtmax; 3,590 +/- 74 versus 2915 +/- 64 mm Hg s-1 in the enalapril group, p less than 0.001), and diastolic pressure (13.7 +/- 0.9 mm Hg vs. 20.0 +/- 1.6 mm Hg in the enalapril group, p less than 0.05). We conclude that pretreatment with ACE inhibitors improves myocardial recovery after cardioplegic arrest and that captopril is more effective than enalapril. The additional protection afforded by captopril was not flow mediated, suggesting that the cardioprotective effects of this drug not only involve an ACE inhibition-dependent coronary vasodilation but could be related to a thiol-dependent limitation of oxidative injury.", 
    "411": "We wished to determine whether angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition alters the effect of hypoxia and reoxygenation directly on the cardiac myocyte; to compare two different ACE inhibitors, one with and one without a sulfhydryl group (i.e., captopril and cilazapril), and to examine the potential interaction of these ACE inhibitors with agents that purportedly prevent the deleterious action of oxygen-derived free radicals. Ventricular myocytes were obtained from 7-day-old chick embryo hearts and were maintained in culture for 96 h before study. Hypoxia produced a significant (p less than 0.05) and marked reduction in cardiac contractile frequency that was not influenced by captopril 10(-6) and 10(-7) M or cilazapril 10(-6) or 10(-7) M. During the reoxygenation period, cardiac contractile frequency gradually returned to normal. Both ACE inhibitors, captopril and cilazapril, were associated with a similar significant (p less than 0.05) enhancement of restoration of contractile frequency. Angiotensin II (ANGII) reversed the effect of these ACE inhibitors. Two agents that reduce reoxygenation-induced myocardial damage, perhaps through alteration in production or degradation of oxygen-derived free radicals, i.e., allopurinol and superoxide dismutase (SOD), significantly (p less than 0.05) accelerated recovery of cardiac myocytes during reoxygenation. There was no additive effect with either captopril or cilazapril plus allopurinol or SOD. Conclusions about the actions of these ACE inhibitors must be tempered by the evidence that substrates other than ANGI, particularly bradykinin, are processed by the enzyme and inhibited by ACE inhibitors so that some of the observed effects may have been due to accumulation of other substrates.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Four weeks later, structural (LV mass and LV wall thickness) as well as functional parameters [LV end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes, stroke volume (SV), ejection fraction (EF)] were determined in anesthetized animals by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The rats were then divided into two groups, one of them receiving spirapril (10 mg/kg/day) in food. LV parameters were evaluated by MRI at 4, 18, 25, and 32 days after treatment was started. MRI analysis before the start of treatment showed that both groups had developed a similar degree of eccentric LV hypertrophy. Similarly, LV wall thickness, end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes, SV, and EF did not differ between the groups. Treatment with spirapril resulted in stable LV weight during the follow-up period of 32 days, whereas the untreated group showed a significant steady increase in heart weight. LV end-diastolic volume, LV end-systolic volume, and SV were smaller in the spirapril group when measured after 25 and 32 days, but only the difference in end-diastolic volume reached statistical significance. LV wall thickness and EF were not affected by spirapril. After the last MRI determinations, blood pressure (BP) and the response to angiotensin I (ANGI) were measured in conscious animals.

Captopril was a more effective FR scavenger at pH 5.0 than at pH 7.5. Captopril (2 x 10(-5) M) also scavenged the other toxic oxygen species hydrogen peroxide and singlet oxygen and inhibited microsomal lipid peroxidation.

To determine whether acute ACE inhibition may influence myocardial perfusion deficit during ischemia and reduce ischemia-reperfusion injury, anesthetized open-chest dogs underwent 2-h left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) occlusion followed by 6-h reperfusion. After 1-h coronary occlusion, each dog was randomized to receive either captopril [5 mg/kg intravenous (i.v.) bolus and 0.25/kg/h infusion for 7 h] or saline. Whereas arterial pressure was reduced (p = 0.001), captopril did not influence myocardial perfusion deficit: Blood flow in the central ischemic zone represented 17.1 +/- 2.8% of the flow in the nonischemic zone versus 20.5 +/- 3.8% before treatment (NS). The values of the control group were 17.8 +/- 2.5 and 16.7 +/- 2.4%, respectively. In addition, there was no difference in infarct size: 35.9 +/- 3.3% of the area at risk in captopril-treated dogs versus 40.0 +/- 3.6% in controls. Analysis of subgroups based on the level of the collateral flow indicated, however, that ACE inhibition had an adverse effect on infarct size in dogs with high collateral flow: 31.9 +/- 4.6% in captopril dogs versus 17.6 +/- 4.7 (p = 0.048). This effect was related to a decrease in collateral flow because animals exhibiting the highest increase in perfusion deficit presented the greatest increase in infarct size (r = -0.92, p = 0.003). Although in dogs with low collateral flow, ACE inhibition appeared to exert a slight beneficial effect on infarct size, we conclude that at least in this dog model, acute ACE inhibition could exacerbate myocardial injury.", 
    "415": "In the isolated working rat heart model, we studied metabolic and hemodynamic effects of 5- and 30-min global ischemia followed by reperfusion and assessed the potentially beneficial effect of captopril 80 micrograms/ml added throughout the experiment. Creatine kinase (CK) and catecholamines were measured in coronary effluent. De novo eicosanoids (prostaglandin E2) synthesis was assessed in endocardial explants. Hemodynamic alterations occurred after 30-min ischemia and were reflected most dramatically by a reduction in cardiac output (CO 72 +/- 10% of baseline values in captopril vs. 68 +/- 16% in controls) without significant differences as a result of treatment. Captopril shortened reperfusion ventricular fibrillation (VF) duration (6.9 +/- 1.2 vs. 13.6 +/- 8.7 min, p less than 0.05) but had no effect on VF incidence. No differences occurred in norepinephrine (NE) outflow, whereas total CK release was greater in controls. Five controls versus none of the treated hearts (p less than 0.05) released trace amounts of epinephrine during reperfusion. Increased de novo PGE2 synthesis was demonstrated after 5-min I (465 +/- 168 vs. 238 +/- 75 pg/100 mg tissue per hour, p less than 0.01). Captopril stimulated production of PGE2 in normoxic hearts (p less than 0.02), but the difference was no more apparent in ischemic hearts. We conclude that captopril produces some biochemical and electrophysiologic evidence of myocardial salvage, but these effects are not sufficient to induce hemodynamic improvement after global ischemia and reperfusion.", 
    "416": "Enalapril, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor usually administered orally once daily, decreases blood pressure by lowering peripheral vascular resistance without increasing heart rate or output. It is effective in lowering blood pressure in all grades of essential and renovascular hypertension. Patients not responding adequately to enalapril monotherapy usually respond with the addition of a thiazide diuretic (or a calcium antagonist or beta-blocker), and rarely require a third antihypertensive agent. Enalapril is at least as effective as other established and newer ACE inhibitors, and members of other antihypertensive drug classes including diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium antagonists and alpha-blockers, but therapy with enalapril may be less frequently limited by serious adverse effects or treatment contraindications than with other drug classes. The most frequent adverse effect limiting all ACE inhibitor therapy in clinical practice is cough. This favourable profile of efficacy and tolerability, and the substantial weight of clinical experience, explain the increasing acceptance of enalapril as a major antihypertensive treatment and supports its use as logical first-line therapeutic option.", 
    "417": "Peptide mediators or neuropeptides released from sensory nerves may induce inflammatory effects in airways, but their effects on airway blood velocity and lung resistance have not been previously studied simultaneously in awake animals. Nine adult sheep were chronically prepared for continuous measurement of blood flow velocity to the distal trachea and bronchi by surgical implantation of a 20-MHz pulsed Doppler flow probe on the common bronchial branch of the bronchoesophageal artery. Awake restrained animals were intubated and connected to a pneumotachograph to measure resistance to airflow across the lung (RL). Doubling doses of bradykinin (BK, 0.02-1.51 nmol/kg), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP, 0.004-0.26 nmol/kg), or substance P (SP, 0.02-1.19 nmol/kg) were injected as a bolus into the right atrium while mean arterial pressure (MAP), bronchial blood velocity (Vbr), and RL were measured. BK at 0.76 nmol/kg caused a transient dose-related increase in Vbr from a baseline of 19.3 +/- 2.5 to 41.4 +/- 4.1 (SE) cm/s (P less than 0.05) despite a decrease in MAP from 118 +/- 6 to 80 +/- 6 mmHg.

    "418": "To investigate the role of the renin-angiotensin system in steroidogenic enzyme expression, the angiotensin-I converting enzyme inhibitor captopril was administered in conjunction with high potassium (K+) or low (Na+) intake to rats for a 7-day period. Northern blot analysis of adrenocortical zona glomerulosa RNA revealed that sodium restriction markedly increased mRNA production of P-450scc (3.1-fold) and P-450(11 beta) (3.4-fold) as well as of the electron donor adrenodoxin (2.0-fold). Captopril combined to the low Na+ diet led to suppression of these effects and, as also seen with captopril alone, further diminished P-450(11 beta) mRNA levels below controls. These responses were accompanied by parallel changes in respective protein levels of the enzymes as indicated by Western blot analyses. Captopril was also shown to inhibit the K(+)-stimulated levels of P-450(11 beta) mRNA (3.3-fold) and protein (1.4-fold) beneath control values (0.6- and 0.8-fold, respectively). On the other hand, increased P-450scc mRNA and protein levels by K+ loading were not affected by captopril treatment. No response was observed in any steroidogenic enzyme expression in zona fasciculata-reticularis following either diet with or without captopril. Thus, the inhibitory effect of captopril on stimulated steroidogenesis seemed to be mediated in part through transcriptional regulation of P450s. In addition, it appeared that P-450(11 beta) expression might be under the control of the renin-angiotensin system in both high K+ and low Na+ diets as opposed to the K+ stimulation of P-450scc where other mechanisms seemed to be involved.",

All studies included compared active treatment to baseline (placebo or no treatment) with the patients as their own control and used blinded, randomized trials. Change was measured by self and/or interviewer-assisted evaluation, standardized psychomotor/cognitive tests, or sleep laboratory observations. After an exhaustive literature search (1970 to 1990), nine published trials of 27 population groups (n = 1620) using 14 drugs from six pharmacological groups met selection criteria and were analyzed for five QL constructs: sexual function, sleep, psychomotor, general well-being, and mood. Small positive effect size (d) improvement with treatment was seen for sleep (d = 0.106), psychomotor (d = 0.283), general well-being (d = 0.139), and mood (d = 0.167) while no effect could be determined for sexual function (d = -0.030) based on 95% confidence intervals. Either a comparably small improvement with treatment or no effect was seen among various pharmacological drug groups; no negative effect with treatment was identified. A larger positive effect could be postulated if the drug choice was individualized to the patient rather than randomized as in clinical trial methodology. Although none of the drug groups had a clearly superior effect, a more frequent positive effect with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers was seen for all constructs. Narrower demographics and smaller sample sizes may have biased similar positive effects in calcium-channel blockers and diuretics.",

The efficacy and safety profile of lovastatin given in the presence of antihypertensive medication was evaluated using patient subgroups identified in the Expanded Clinical Evaluation of Lovastatin (EXCEL) Study. The EXCEL study examined 8,245 patients with moderate hypercholesterolemia randomly assigned either to a group treated with lovastatin (20-80 mg daily) or to a group given placebo for 48 weeks.

The placebo-corrected dose-dependent effect of lovastatin on the percent change from baseline in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was not attenuated in any subgroup and was slightly enhanced in the calcium antagonist subgroup (-29% to -44%, p = 0.06) when compared with patients taking no antihypertensive agents (-24% to -40%); this difference, however, was only of borderline significance. Patterns of lovastatin-induced increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and decrease in triglycerides were not consistently different among the subgroups.

When the same peptides were assayed as potential inhibitors of the hydrolysis of hippuryl-His-Leu (specific substrate for ACE activity), substance P and its (1-9) fragment were equally potent, whereas neurokinin A was inactive. The beta-casomorphins, beta-casein derived opioid peptides, with a proline residue at their C-terminus also showed inhibitory action on ACE activity, without being cleaved by the enzyme. These results indicate a modulatory action of these peptides. No differences between ACE originating from different tissues or body fluids could be demonstrated in this regard.",

The detection limit was 0.77 fmol ml-1, and the extraction recovery of [125I]-Ang I added to albumin buffer was 83% at the inflection point (10 fmol ml-1) of the standard curve. The overall recovery was 98.5 +/- 3.5%. The intra- and inter-assay reproducibility was 10.4% and 9.7% respectively. Cross-reactivity of the antiserum used was low (less than 0.3%) with all angiotensin peptides tested except Ang (2-10) nonapeptide. 3.

During the hypotension which lasted 78 (SEM 10) min, only minor adjustments of the isoflurane concentration (0.70 (0.04%) were needed. The desired level of hypotension was obtained with preservation of the cardiac output and without tachycardia. No resistance to the blood pressure lowering effect of isoflurane was observed.

Aminopeptidase P purified from pig kidney cortex was found to contain one atom of zinc per polypeptide chain, confirming its metalloenzyme nature. The concentrations of converting enzyme inhibitors required to cause 50% inhibition (I50) of aminopeptidase P were in the low micromolar range. The most potent converting enzyme inhibitors toward aminopeptidase P were the carboxylalkyl compounds, cilazaprilat, enalaprilat, and ramiprilat (I50 values of 3-12 microM). The sulfhydryl compounds captopril (I50 110 microM) and YS980 (I50 20 microM) were slightly less potent at inhibiting aminopeptidase P. In contrast, the carboxylalkyl compounds benazeprilat, lisinopril, and pentoprilat; the sulfhydryl compound rentiapril; and the phosphoryl compounds ceranopril and fosinoprilat had no inhibitory effect against aminopeptidase P. This compares with I50 values in the 1-6 nM range for these inhibitors with angiotensin converting enzyme. Inhibition of aminopeptidase P may account for some of the effects or side effects noted with the clinical use of converting enzyme inhibitors. These results may provide the basis for the design of more selective inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme or mixed inhibitors of aminopeptidase P and angiotensin converting enzyme, or both.",

Maximal ACE inhibition was produced by the 2.5, 5, and 20 mg doses (but not by 0.5 mg), but there was evidence of dose-dependency only for the duration of ACE inhibition. Quinaprilat was detectable in plasma up to 72 hours after all doses and the terminal phase half-life was calculated at 26 +/- 7 hours. Although there were dose-related increases in area under the curve (AUC), the relationships between dose and both AUC and maximum concentration were nonlinear. These findings suggest that quinapril displays the same prolonged terminal phase half-life that is characteristic of other ACE inhibitor drugs. The failure of doses above 2.5 mg to produce any further increase in the magnitude of ACE inhibition is consistent with an maximum effect dose-response relationship, with the obvious implication that higher doses will increase only the duration not the magnitude of response.",

Dialyzed serum was chromatographed successively on Affi-gel blue, hydroxyapatite, DE-cellulose, phenyl-Sepharose, an affinity matrix for angiotensin converting enzyme and concanavalin-Sepharose. On the latter matrix, 68% of the enzyme activity was eluted with alpha-methyl mannoside at 10 and 100 mM, and 29% was eluted with alpha-methyl glucoside, 500 mM, at 56 degrees C. The two fractions ('biantennary' and 'high mannose' fractions, respectively) were concentrated and then chromatographed separately on Sephacryl S-200HR. Both fractions were eluted as expected for a globular protein of Mr 217,000. On SDS-PAGE, under reducing and non-reducing conditions, each of the concanavalin-Sepharose fractions was separated into two protein bands, Mr 89,000 and Mr 81,500.

Hydrolysis of the substrate was strongly inhibited by bradykinin and those of its lower homologs that contain two adjacent proline residues. Cu2+ was strongly inhibitory. Co2+ at 30 microM activated the enzyme, as did Mn2+, Mg2+ and Ca2+ at higher concentrations. Sulfhydryl compounds, including captopril, inhibited the enzyme as did 1,10-phenanthroline. Iodoacetamide and N-ethylmaleimide had no effects, but 4-hydroxymercuribenzoate conferred a partial inhibition over a remarkably wide concentration range: 0.34-1400 microM. Amastatin and bestatin did not inhibit the enzyme.

To assess the effect of quinapril on renal function and structure, a 4-week time-course study was conducted in male Wistar rats with daily oral gavage doses of 0, 10, 100, or 400 mg/kg. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimated as creatinine clearance and fractional electrolyte excretion values were derived from urinalysis and blood chemistry data obtained at days 1, 7, 14, and 28. Renal sections were collected on these days for histopathologic evaluation, and cortical slices were obtained to assess organic ion transport in vitro. Expected pharmacologic effects of an ACE inhibitor were observed at all doses and included increased urine output, increased water consumption, decreased serum aldosterone (65 or 25% of control at 10 or 400 mg/kg, respectively, on day 28), increased plasma renin activity (PRA, up to two- to threefold higher than controls at day 28), and hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular apparatus. Despite these expected class effects, quinapril administration to male rats for 28 days produced no functional alterations or renal tubular lesions suggestive of renal toxicity at doses up to 400-fold higher than the effective antihypertensive dose in rats.",

With appropriate therapy, renal function is usually restored within a few days. Renal artery stenosis, dehydration and diuretics stimulate the renin angiotensin system and make preservation of normal renal function, increasingly dependent on angiotensin II. The prevalence of renal artery stenosis is substantially increased in patients with peripheral vascular disease or with coronary artery disease with concomitant hypertension. Patients should be told about the increased risk of adverse effects to the kidneys if they become dehydrated. In these cases it is essential to reduce the dose diuretics and ACEI, and it may be necessary to give parenteral fluid substitution.",

Since the vasodepressor action of kinins may be linked to the generation of prostaglandins and endothelium-derived relaxing factors, we also investigated the role of prostaglandins and nitric oxide in the blood pressure reduction caused by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. To this end, we contrasted the hypotensive effects of captopril (10 mg/kg i.v.), ramiprilat (2 mg/kg i.v.), and the angiotensin II antagonist DuP 753 (30 mg/kg i.v.) in spontaneously hypertensive rats with and without pretreatment with a kinin antagonist (D-Arg-Arg-Pro-Hyp-Gly-Thi-Ser-D-Phe-Thi-Arg-trifluoroacetic acid) (200 micrograms/kg/min i.v.), an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthesis (NG-monomethyl-L-arginine) (15 mg/kg + 10 mg/kg/hr i.v.), or an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis (indomethacin) (10 mg/kg i.v.). The kinin antagonist did not affect blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats but did attenuate the hypotensive effect of captopril and ramiprilat; the kinin antagonist did not minimize the depressor action of DuP 753. The nitric oxide synthesis inhibitor increased blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats and attenuated the hypotensive effect of captopril, ramiprilat, and DuP 753, but it did not impede the hypotensive effect of sodium nitroprusside. Pretreatment of hypertensive rats with indomethacin did not modify the acute hypotensive effect of ramiprilat or captopril. These data suggest a contribution of endogenous kinins and nitric oxide to the acute antihypertensive effect of captopril and ramiprilat in spontaneously hypertensive rats and of nitric oxide to the hypotensive effect of DuP 753.",

    "468": "Bradykinin is a potent vasodilator peptide; however, its half-life in vivo is very short because of various plasma and tissue peptidases that hydrolyze bradykinin to inactive fragments. We studied the role of kininase II (angiotensin converting enzyme) and neutral endopeptidase 24.11 (enkephalinase) in the catabolism of bradykinin in vascular tissue by determining the effect of inhibitors of kininase II (captopril) and of endopeptidase 24.11 (phosphoramidon) on the action of bradykinin on rat isolated mesenteric arteries. Because bradykinin may induce prostaglandin formation and release, we also studied the effect of a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin, on the action of bradykinin. The mesenteric bed was isolated from rats (250-300 g) with rats under either anesthesia and was perfused with Krebs' solution (4 ml/min) containing phenylephrine (0.5-1.0 microgram/ml) to produce a mean perfusion pressure of 120-130 mm Hg. Bradykinin (2.5-40.0 ng), injected as a bolus, produced a dose-dependent decrease in perfusion pressure. In the presence of indomethacin (1.0 microgram/ml), the amplitude of the vasodilator responses to bradykinin was not significantly affected, although the duration of the responses was increased approximately two to four times. In the presence of captopril (1.0 microgram/ml), bradykinin elicited either a vasodilator or a biphasic effect. The vasodilator effect was greatly potentiated by captopril, whereas the duration of the response was unchanged when compared with control experiments. When present, the pressor responses were also dose related. In the presence of indomethacin plus captopril, bradykinin produced only a fall in perfusion pressure that lasted five to six times longer than without any treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "470": "Increases in renal venous pressure have been shown to consistently increase renal interstitial pressure; however, not until renal interstitial pressure is increased threefold is a natriuresis noted in normal animals. Since the intrarenal angiotensin II (Ang II) concentration has been postulated to increase with increasing renal venous pressure, the antinatriuretic action of Ang II could override the natriuretic effect of increased renal interstitial pressure. Therefore, the role of Ang II in the natriuretic response to increased renal venous pressure was examined in 10 pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs. Mean arterial pressure, renal blood flow, renal interstitial pressure, glomerular filtration rate, urinary sodium excretion, plasma renin activity, and prostaglandin E2 excretion were measured at renal venous pressures of 3, 15, and 30 mm Hg. The measurements were repeated after the administration of captopril (1 mg/kg i.v. bolus, n = 5) or [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II (50 micrograms/kg i.v. bolus + 50 micrograms/kg/hr infusion, n = 5). Under control conditions, mean arterial pressure, renal blood flow, plasma renin activity, and prostaglandin E2 excretion remained unchanged when renal venous pressure was increased. The elevations in renal venous pressure increased renal interstitial pressure from 7 +/- 2 to 12 +/- 2 and 22 +/- 4 mm Hg, while sodium excretion remained unchanged until renal venous pressure was 30 mm Hg. In the captopril-treated group, increasing renal venous pressure increased renal interstitial pressure as under control conditions; however, sodium excretion (23 +/- 4, 19 +/- 4, and 27 +/- 6 mueq/min) was not significantly increased even at the highest renal venous pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Patients were classified into 2 groups: those with (n = 14) and those without (n = 16) MR. No significant differences were observed between the 2 groups in pretreatment studies. Exercise tolerance increased significantly in the group with MR (p less than 0.001) during the year of follow-up, from 514 +/- 193 seconds at baseline study to 671 +/- 178 seconds (p less than 0.0005) at 1 month, 688 +/- 127 seconds (p less than 0.0005) at 3 months and 690 +/- 108 seconds (p less than 0.01) at 12 months.

At 12 months the increase was not statistically significant. Left ventricular end-diastolic diameter decreased more in the group with than without MR, although the differences were not significant.

Although the reason for this is not yet clear, the possibility of a negative inotropic effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors was demonstrated by intracoronary injection. The effects of an oral dose of captopril on systolic performance were assessed by examining left ventricular (LV) pressure-volume loops obtained with simultaneous cineangiography and micromanometer pressure recordings before and 90 minutes after administration of oral captopril (25 to 50 mg) in 18 patients with chronic, severe mitral regurgitation. Group 1 (n = 9) was given captopril alone, and group 2 (n = 9) was given captopril plus atropine (0.04 mg/kg intravenous) to assess the role of parasympathetic activity in mediating the effects of captopril. Captopril reduced heart rate (90 to 81 beats/min; p less than 0.002) and LV end-diastolic pressure (13 to 10 mm Hg; p = 0.03), despite a slight increase in end-diastolic volume (257 to 264 ml; p = not significant) that suggests improved diastolic properties. Despite a decrease in end-systolic pressure (103 to 90 mm Hg; p less than 0.001), ejection fraction did not increase (0.60 to 0.58; p = not significant) owing to an increase in end-systolic volume (107 to 114 ml; p = 0.008).

In each patient the efficacy of placebo, captopril (50 to 100 mg), ISDN (10 mg), and a combination of captopril (50 to 100 mg) and ISDN (10 mg) was assessed by repeated exercise treadmill tests performed before and 1, 2, 3 and 6 hours after administration of a single dose. A single-blind, randomized technique was applied. According to the mean data in the whole group of 14 patients, captopril alone produced no improvement in exercise duration to the onset of angina and to angina of moderate severity compared with placebo. The magnitude of ST-segment depression did not significantly change after captopril administration. ISDN alone significantly increased exercise duration to onset of angina and to angina of moderate severity (antianginal effect) and decreased the magnitude of ST-segment depression (antiischemic effect) 1 to 3 hours after administration. Combined administration of ISDN and captopril resulted in more expressed antianginal and antiischemic effects; at 2, 3 and 6 hours these effects with ISDN plus captopril were significantly more pronounced than those with ISDN alone. According to individual data, the most marked potentiation of ISDN efficacy was observed in patients who had poor response to ISDN alone.

    "474": "Changes in relative left-to-right lung blood flow ratios were followed as an index of vascular radiation injury in left-hemithorax-irradiated Sprague-Dawley rats. Single doses of 11 to 21 Gy gamma radiation resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in relative blood flow to the irradiated lung from 3 to 5 weeks after exposure during the development of pneumonitis. Blood flow returned to near normal by 5 weeks after lower doses (11-13.5 Gy). After a single dose of 15 Gy the left-to-right blood flow ratio recovered to 75% of normal at 12 weeks and leveled off. Following 18 Gy irradiation a second period of reduced flow began 16 weeks after exposure. After 21 Gy irradiation flow to the irradiated side remained low for 1 year after exposure. Rats that received a single dose of 18 Gy to the left hemithorax were also treated with one or two of the following drugs: captopril, cyproheptadine, dexamethasone, diethylcarbamazine, penicillamine, or theophylline. Dexamethasone was most effective at preventing the decrease in blood flow to the irradiated lung when treatment was continued through the pneumonitis period and dose was not tapered until 8 weeks after radiation exposure. All other drugs and drug combinations were, for the most part, virtually ineffective after the pneumonitis period. There was a relatively poor correlation with earlier vascular permeability surface area product studies. This suggests that endothelial damage, as well as damage to other cell types, contributes to the development of post-irradiation fibrosis in the lung.",

However, no pharmacologic intervention has yet been shown to reproducibly reduce the incidence of restenosis after coronary balloon angioplasty in humans. To identify the reasons for the apparent nonspecificity of the animal models and to determine which model should most reliably predict the efficacy of individual therapies in humans, the distinguishing characteristics of the experimental models were compared. Particular attention was paid to the size and morphologic structure of the treated artery, the susceptibility of the species to spontaneous and diet-induced arterial disease, the nature of the stimulus to intimal proliferation and several practical and logistic considerations. Finally, the reported efficacies of specific drug therapies in the respective animal models and in humans were compared. This review suggests that significant interspecies and occasionally intraspecies differences do exist among the respective animal models, particularly in the extent and composition of the neointimal thickening.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "477": "Thiyl free radicals have been shown to react with polyunsaturated fatty acids via abstraction of bisallylic hydrogen, forming pentadienyl radicals, and via addition to the double bonds. In the absence of oxygen, the latter pathway leads to regeneration of thiyl radicals through beta-elimination or \"repair\" of the adduct radicals by thiols. In the presence of oxygen, fixation of thiyl-induced damage occurs through reaction of O2 with the pentadienyl radical (yielding conjugated dienyl peroxyl radicals) and also with the thiyl-to-double bond adduct radical. A quantitative reaction scheme evaluated from these data considers abstraction, addition, rearrangement, and repair reactions, and the evaluation of rate constants for the individual steps. Absolute rate constants have been measured, in particular, for reactions of thiyl free radicals from glutathione, cysteine, homocysteine, N-acetylcysteine, cysteine ethyl ester, penicillamine, captopril, mercaptoethanol, and dithiothreitol with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) ranging from 18:2 to 22:6, and the lipids trilinolein and trilinolenin. The rate constants for hydrogen abstraction were found to be typically of the order of 10(7) mol-1 dm3 s-1 and to increase with increasing lipophilicity of the attacking thiyl radical. Thioperoxyl radicals, RSOO., were found to be rather unreactive toward PUFAs, in contrast to the isomer sulfonyl radicals, RSO2., which not only abstract hydrogen from the bisallylic methylene groups of the PUFAs (although only at relatively small yield) but also readily add to the PUFA double bonds (major pathway). Specific information was obtained on the optical properties of the thiyl radical derived from the ACE inhibitor captopril, CpS.

Regional brain slices (2 mm x 230 microns) prepared from nucleus accumbens, caudate-putamen, and hippocampus were incubated for 2 h in the absence and presence of phosphoramidon, captopril, N-[1(R,S)-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl]-Ala-Ala-Phe-p-aminobenzoate, and o-Phenanthroline, which are inhibitors of neutral endopeptidase 24.11, angiotensin-converting enzyme, metalloendopeptidase 24.15, and nonspecific metallopeptidases, respectively. Neurotensin-degrading proteolytic activity varied by brain region. Significantly less (35.0 +/- 1.6%) neurotensin was lost from hippocampus than from caudate-putamen (45.4 +/- 1.0%) or nucleus accumbens (47.8 +/- 1.1%) in the absence of inhibitors. Peptidases responsible for neurotensin metabolism on brain slices were found to be predominantly metallopeptidases. Metalloendopeptidase 24.15 is of major importance in neurotensin metabolism in each brain region studied. The relative contribution of specific peptidases to neurotensin metabolism also varied by brain region; angiotensin-converting enzyme and neutral endopeptidase 24.11 activities were markedly elevated in the caudate-putamen as compared with the nucleus accumbens or hippocampus. Interregional variation in the activity of specific peptidases leads to altered neurotensin fragment formation. The brain microslice technique makes feasible regional peptide metabolism studies in the CNS, which are impractical with synaptosomes, and provides evidence for regional specificity of neurotensin degradation.",

The compounds studied were biotin, captopril, cefoxitin, cephalexin, the sodium salt of penicillin G, sulfathiazole, and thiamine hydrochloride. Biotin, captopril, cephalexin, and sulfathiazole were found to have a significant effect in reducing the nephrotoxicity of cisplatin when administered simultaneously with cisplatin via an intravenous route in the rat. Biotin was the most effective in providing renal protection and sulfathiazole the least effective, based upon BUN, serum creatinine values, and weight changes, though all four of these compounds provided a considerable measure of protection against the typical cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. The effect of the simultaneous administration of cisplatin with biotin, cephalexin, and sulfathiazole was examined on the antitumor activity of cisplatin toward the L1210 murine leukemia in the DBA/2 mouse and the Walker 256 carcinosarcoma in the rat. With the L1210 murine leukemia no loss of antitumor activity was found for any of the compounds. With the Walker 256 carcinosarcoma some loss of antitumor activity was found with biotin.

Multiple-choice 34-item questionnaires with three possible answers (severe, mild and none) per question were used to assess symptoms and mood. Twenty patients were initially given enalapril and 16 were initially given trichlormethiazide. There was no significant difference in the antihypertensive efficacy of the 2 drugs. Treatment with enalapril resulted in significant improvement in 11 of the 34 items, and a tendency for another 4 items to improve. Treatment with trichlormethiazide resulted in significant improvement in only 5 items and a tendency to improve in 2. When enalapril and trichlormethiazide were compared, significantly greater improvement in 2 items and a tendency toward greater improvement in 4 items was seen with enalapril treatment. Thus, enalapril was found to be more efficacious than trichlormethiazide with respect to quality of life in patients with hypertension.", 
    "485": "In a half-year open clinical study the authors investigated the antihypertensive action of enalapril--an inhibitor of the angiotensin converting enzyme--and its action on renal functions in a group of 11 patients with nephrogenic hypertension. In seven patients monotherapy, using a mean dose of 12 mg, was sufficiently effective. In the remaining four patients treatment was combined with diuretics. It was revealed: that: 1. a significant drop of systolic and diastolic pressure occurred with a concurrent decline of the total peripheral vascular resistance, 2. a slight (statistically not significant) reduction of the glomerular filtration as well as quantitative proteinuria with a decline of glomerular hypertension. 3. In this group of patients without left ventricular hypertrophy no signs of regression of its mass were present. 4. Even in patients with nephrogenic disease no negative effect on the lipid, carbohydrate and purine metabolism was observed. The subjective tolerance of the preparation was very satisfactory.", 
    "486": "Seventy one mild to moderate essential hypertensive patients receiving out-patient treatment with Captopril--inhibitor of the conversion enzyme--during a period of six months, are studied. The therapeutic goal (DAP less than 95 mm Hg.) was reached in 88% of the cases, with just a single Captopril dose of 50 mg/day in 42 patients (59.1%). AP decreased from 174.2/100.2 mm Hg. to 149.2/84.0 mm Hg. (p less than 0.001). Any significant changes in heart rate nor in body weight were observed. Side effects were rare (just in two patients), although their intensity determined in both cases the interruption of treatment. Finally, and improvement in the metabolic profile of patients was observed, with reduction in glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides and uric acid at the end of the study.", 
    "487": "We present a non-controlled prospective study of 10 hypertensive patients with systemic erythematous lupus and nephropathy, treated with captopril exclusively or combined with other drugs, in order to assess its effectivity and potential side effects. Four of these 10 patients had mild hypertension; 3, moderate hypertension and 3, severe hypertension. In 5 of them, arterial pressures was controlled with just captopril; in other 3, we added furosemide and in one patient, we added furosemide and nifedipine. In one case, hypertension was not controlled. Renal function remained stable and proteinuria improved in six patients. Three patients presented reversible agranulocytosis, during or immediately after treatment. One of them was treated two years after with enalapril, without observing hematologic recurrence. We conclude that captopril is useful in treating arterial hypertension associated to lupous nephropathy, but frequent leukocyte counting controls must be done during the first months.", 
    "488": "We report a case of drug-induced pemphigus caused by an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril. The cutaneous reaction remitted after withdrawal of captopril therapy. Unique to this case, however, was the substitution of another angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril, without exacerbation of the pemphigus. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported patient with captopril-induced pemphigus in whom no new lesions developed after subsequent treatment with enalapril. A difference in chemical structure between these two drugs, particularly of a sulfur moiety, may help explain why the drug-induced disease did not recur.", 
    "489": "The impact of hostility was examined in relation to the conduct and results of a clinical field trial. Data were derived from a multi-center randomized double-blind study of the comparative effects of antihypertensive therapy (captopril, methyldopa and propranolol) on the quality of life of 620 hypertensive men. Hostility levels were higher in subjects reporting skipping medication dosages compared to those reporting they always complied with the medication schedule. Reporting of symptoms often associated with antihypertensive drug regimens was positively related to hostility scores throughout the study, even during the blinded placebo period. Persons with high hostility scores showed the greatest decline in blood pressure independent of type of antihypertensive medication. However, there was some limited evidence that hostility levels were significantly reduced by one antihypertensive medication. Overall, the present findings suggest that double-blind pharmacologic clinical trials may benefit from using reliable measures of hostility as covariates in the evaluation of symptom reports and amount of blood pressure reduction.", 
    "490": "We investigated the effects of an intravenous (pentobarbital sodium) and inhalational (halothane) general anesthetic on the pulmonary vascular responses to angiotensin II and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (CEI). Multipoint pulmonary vascular pressure-flow (P/Q) plots were generated in conscious pentobarbital- (30 mg/kg iv) and halothane-anesthetized (approximately 1.2% end-tidal) dogs in the intact (no drug) condition, during angiotensin II administration (60 ng.kg-1.min-1 iv), and during CEI (captopril 1 mg/kg plus 1 mg.kg-1.h-1 iv). In conscious dogs, angiotensin II increased (P less than 0.001) the pulmonary vascular pressure gradient [pulmonary arterial pressure--pulmonary arterial wedge pressure (PAP-PAWP)] over the empirically measured range of Q; i.e., angiotensin II caused pulmonary vasoconstriction. Pulmonary vasoconstriction (P less than 0.01) in response to angiotensin II was also observed during pentobarbital sodium anesthesia. In contrast, angiotensin II had no effect on the P/Q relationship during halothane anesthesia. In conscious dogs, CEI decreased (P less than 0.001) PAP-PAWP over the empirically measured range of Q; i.e., CEI caused pulmonary vasodilation. However, CEI caused pulmonary vasoconstriction (P less than 0.02) during pentobarbital sodium and had no effect on the P/Q relationship during halothane. Thus, compared with the conscious state, the pulmonary vasoconstrictor response to angiotensin II is unchanged or abolished, and the pulmonary vasodilator response to CEI is reversed to vasoconstriction or abolished during pentobarbital sodium and halothane anesthesia, respectively.",

    "498": "Very little information is available on the permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to small polar drugs in chronic hypertension. The blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pharmacokinetics of libenzapril (LZP), a potent angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, were investigated in hypertensive (SH) and normotensive (SD) rats. Following intravenous bolus administration of this hydrophilic drug, the terminal rate constant for elimination (beta), steady-state volume of distribution (Vdss), and systemic clearance (CL) were similar in these two animal groups. Other pharmacokinetic parameters (Cpo, alpha, k12, and k21) were significantly (P less than 0.05) greater in the hypertensive group, except for the volume of the central compartment (Vc) and ratio of Vc to Vdss, which were smaller in SH rats. The ratio of area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) in CSF to blood was about twofold higher in SH rats compared to normotensive rats, showing increased BBB permeability in hypertensive rats. An acute brain uptake study was also performed in SH, SD, and WK rats by intracarotid administration of 14C-LZP along with 3H2O as a reference marker. Both LZP and water transport was found to be significantly higher (about two- to five-fold) in six of the seven different brain regions in SH rats as compared to the normotensive (SD and WK) controls. Because of this simultaneous increase in concentrations of both the drug and the reference marker, BUI values were not affected. Regional brain concentrations in SH rats were also linearly correlated with the mean arterial pressure (MAP) values, providing further evidence of the systemic pressure related increase in BBB permeability.", 
    "499": "Results from animal experiments have suggested that treatment with recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) causes changes in renal hemodynamics which are detrimental to renal function. Therefore, the effects of correction of the anemia by rHuEPO on glomerular filtration rate (GFR; inulin clearance) and effective renal plasma flow (ERPF; PAH clearance) were studied in eight pre-dialysis patients. The studies were done before (Hct 0.24 +/- 0.05 liter/liter) and at 89 +/- 19 days after the start of rHuEPO therapy (Hct 0.39 +/- 0.03 liter/liter). To further evaluate the effects of ACE inhibition, 25 mg of captopril was given orally after baseline values had been obtained. Baseline GFR, renal blood flow (RBF) and filtration fraction (FF) did not change during rHuEPO therapy. At low hematocrit (Hct) captopril induced a significant increase in ERPF and RBF, and a decrease in MAP. After correction of the hematocrit the blood pressure lowering effect of captopril remained unchanged. However, captopril no longer induced changes in ERPF and RBF. We conclude that the increase in hematocrit had no adverse effects on GFR. The results suggest that changes in hematocrit may influence the effects of ACE inhibition on efferent vascular resistance. Therefore, the hematocrit should be taken into account when evaluating studies on the effects of ACE inhibition in the progression of chronic renal failure.", 
    "500": "The hemodynamic effects of separate and combined intravenous administration of the vasopressin (AVP) V1-receptor antagonist SK&F 100273 (10 micrograms/kg) and the angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (20 mg + 1 mg/h) were studied in 12 sheep during stable halothane anesthesia (1.5% end-tidal conc.). The separate blockade of either V1-receptors or angiotensin II (ANG II) synthesis induced a small (7-10%), but significant, fall in mean systemic arterial pressure (MSAP), whereas the combined treatment caused a 30% reduction in blood pressure. The changes in systemic vascular resistance paralleled those of the MSAP. Consequently, the cardiac output was largely unaffected by the interference with AVP effects and/or ANG II synthesis. The halothane anesthesia effectively increased the plasma levels of AVP and ANG II, and plasma renin activity without any relation to changes in MSAP. When either the AVP effects or ANG II synthesis were blocked separately, there was a slight tendency for a compensatory increase of the unimpeded hormonal system. It is concluded that halothane anesthesia increases the plasma levels of AVP and ANG II in sheep, and that the maintenance of the arterial pressure is dependent on the concurrent vasopressor effects of the two hormones in this situation.", 
    "501": "Digitalis should be used for slowing a rapid ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter unassociated with the preexcitation syndrome.

Patients with the tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome should receive maintenance doses of digitalis after pacemaker implantation. Digitalis should not be used for treating CHF with normal LV systolic function unless a supraventricular tachyarrhythmia is present. Conflicting studies have been reported as to the efficacy of digoxin in the treatment of patients with CHF in sinus rhythm. Digoxin may be used for treating CHF with abnormal LV systolic function which does not respond to diuretics and ACE inhibitors or in patients unable to tolerate ACE inhibitor or other vasodilator therapy. Digitalis has a low toxic-therapeutic ratio, especially in elderly persons. Digoxin-specific Fab antibody fragments may be used for treating digitalis toxicity refractory to conventional measures with a treatment response in at least 90% of patients with advanced and potentially life-threatening digitalis toxicity.",

Carbamazepine exposure in utero is associated with a 1% risk of spina bifida. Long-term follow-up of antenatal exposure to phenobarbital and carbamazepine in two groups of infants shows no neurologic differences between the two groups. Magnesium sulfate is more effective in prevention of recurrent eclamptic seizures than phenytoin. During pregnancy, the need for thyroxine increases in many women.

In the dose range 2.5-10 mg once daily the drug has been effective and well tolerated during treatment for up to two years.

Captopril was evaluated as an adjuvant to diuretic and digoxin therapy in heart failure in old age, using walking ability, minute ventilation and oxygen consumption and plasma atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) concentration as measures of outcome. 2. Twenty patients, mean (s.d.) age 81 (6) years, entered a double-blind, randomised, crossover study of three treatments, a twice daily regimen of captopril (AA), at a dosage established by titration against serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity, the same dosage in the morning with placebo at night (AP), and twice daily placebo (PP). Each treatment lasted 3 weeks. A 2 week run-in period on triple therapy, with AA captopril, was used to assess stability and compliance. Seventeen completed all treatments: three completed two. 3. Any benefit of captopril was modest and there was deterioration in gait on the titrated dosage 3 months afterwards (P = 0.04). Efficacy in the old may be greatest when the titrated dose (25 or 50 mg) is given once daily: the multiple daily doses recommended may be unnecessarily demanding. 4. Walking performance was measured by gait analysis (GA) at free walking speed and by a simple walking test (SWT), in which patients stopped at the first relevant symptom. There was a consistent tendency for four measures of performance (GA: speed, stride length and double support time; SWT distance) to be best on the AP treatment, next best on AA, and worst on PP but for the fifth, SWT speed, AP and AA were similar. The trend appeared most marked for SWT distance, mean (s.e. mean) values for AP, AA and PP being 123 (15), 94 (16) and 75 (16) m, respectively. However, the treatment effect did not reach statistical significance at the 0.05 level. 5. There was no significant difference between treatments in minute ventilation, minute oxygen consumption, or their ratio, either at rest or on exercise. 6. Resting ANF concentrations were nearly four times higher (P = 0.0001) in the patients than those, mean (s.e. mean) 66 (5) pmol l-1, in eleven healthy volunteers of mean age 80 (6) years, and the increase on exercise, seen in the controls (P less than 0.01), was absent. In the patients the resting plasma ANF concentration was significantly affected by treatment (P = 0.03), being less on both AP, 245 (9), and AA, 214 (9) than on PP, 264 (10) pmol l-1 (P = 0.02 and 0.03, respectively). 7. Baseline serum ACE activity was induced on active treatment. The change in ACE activity at 3 h post an active dose was significantly greater on AP than AA (P = 0.005). The increased sensitivity to inhibition during once daily administration was reflected in mean arterial pressure. The pre-dose standing pressure was less on AP than on PP (P less than 0.05), and the change in postural fall (pre-dose minus 2 h post), was greater (P = 0.004), but AA and PP were similar in these respects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "505": "This is a metaanalysis of all available studies as of December 1990 that have evaluated the effect of antihypertensive pharmacologic therapy on left ventricular structure examined by echocardiography. We applied preset inclusion criteria to the analysis. A total of 109 studies comprising 2357 patients (28% previously untreated) with an average age of 49 years (range 30 to 71) were included. Overall left ventricular mass (LVM) was reduced by 11.9% [95% confidence interval (CI) 10.1 to 13.7] in parallel with a reduction of mean arterial pressure of 14.9% (CI 14 to 15.8). To differentiate between first-line therapies and to adjust for differences between studies, we performed ANCOVA. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduced LVM by 15% (CI 9.9 to 20.1), beta-blockers by 8% (CI 4.8 to 11.2), calcium antagonists by 8.5% (CI 5.1 to 11.8), and diuretics by 11.3% (CI 5.6 to 17). When we calculated LVM using the same formula for all studies the absolute reductions in grams were 44.7 g with ACE inhibitors, 22.8 g with beta-blockers, 26.9 g with calcium antagonists, and 21.4 g with diuretics. Except for diuretics, all therapies mainly affected wall thickness, while diuretics predominantly reduced ventricular diameter. In conclusion, this metaanalysis shows that ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, and calcium antagonists all reduce LVM by reversing wall hypertrophy, and that the effect is most pronounced with ACE inhibitors. Conversely, diuretics reduce LVM mainly through a reduction of left ventricular volume. Based on these data, we hypothesize that ACE inhibitors are more effective than other first-line therapies in reducing LVM. However, this theory and its possible prognostic implications need to be evaluated in controlled prospective trials.", 
    "506": "Cows that were normally hydrated or deprived of water were given intravenous or intracerebroventricular (icv) infusions of angiotensin I converting-enzyme inhibitors (CEI) or angiotensin II antagonists. Normally hydrated Na-deficient cows increased water intake in a dose-related manner in response to icv infusion of angiotensin I (n = 5). The response to 3 micrograms/h angiotensin I was abolished by concurrent icv infusion of the CEI captopril at 3 mg/h but not by intravenous infusion of captopril at 120 mg/h, which reduced Na appetite (n = 5). The icv infusion of captopril at 12 mg/h did not reduce the water intake of cows that were water restricted for 26.5 h (n = 4) or water restricted and Na deficient (n = 4). The icv infusion of the more lipophilic CEI ramipril at 3 mg/h (n = 7) did not reduce the water intake of normally hydrated or dehydrated cows but reduced the \"need-free\" intake of Na solution by dehydrated cows. The icv infusion of the nonpeptide antagonist Du Pont 753 at 3 mg/h (n = 7) reduced water intake in dehydrated cows. The results indicate that brain angiotensin may be involved in thirst in cattle. The data suggest that this brain angiotensin II may be formed by a pathway that does not include converting enzyme and that is sited inside the blood brain barrier, possibly in the median preoptic nucleus.",

The basal values of maximal developed tension, +T, and -T were similar in the four groups. The increment in +T and -T in response to isoproterenol (10(-4) M) was depressed in the hypertensive animals and in both treated groups (p less than 0.05).

    "511": "This study attempted to evaluate the role of glucoheptonate (GHA) in captopril renography in an in vivo laboratory investigation in which postcaptopril glucoheptonate uptake was analysed in awake 2KlC hypertensive rats. Clamped kidney uptake in a previous study was greater in the poststenotic kidney than in the normal kidney (P = 0.01) in rats with mild renal artery stenosis. A glucoheptonate renogram protocol was developed for use in rats anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbital. An 123I-hippuran scan was performed to determine the relative renal function, followed by a control 99Tcm-GHA scan. Five minutes after administering captopril, another 99Tcm-GHA scan was performed. Relative renal uptake was determined between 30 and 90 s postinjection. 99Tcm-GHA uptake in the clamped kidney was more than 50% of total uptake in 3/9 of the abnormal rats' control scans. No abnormal rats clamped kidney 99Tcm-GHA uptake was greater than 50% in the postcaptopril scans. Captopril reduced GHA uptake in all nine of the animals with baseline scans. These findings suggest that the laboratory observation of captopril induced paradoxically increased 99Tcm-GHA uptake in renal artery stenosis may not be observed scintirenographically. Moreover, the data support a potential value of glucoheptonate in captopril renography.", 
    "512": "The acute hemodynamic and hormonal effects of incremental doses of a specific ovine renin inhibitor (RI: EMD 52 297) and captopril were compared in an ovine model of heart failure. Both RI and captopril inhibited the renin-angiotensin II (ANG II) system, although the decrease in plasma aldosterone (ALDO) was significant only during captopril infusion. Both agents exhibited strong vasodilator properties with similar decreases in mean arterial pressure (MAP, maximum decrease: RI = -20.5 +/- 2.2 mm Hg, p less than 0.001; captopril = -19.8 +/- 1.7 mm Hg, p less than 0.001) and left atrial pressure (LAP, maximum, decrease: RI = -6.8 +/- 1.5 mm Hg, p less than 0.01; captopril = -6.9 +/- 0.4 mm Hg, p less than 0.01) along with a slight increase in cardiac output (CO, maximum increase: RI = 0.54 +/- 0.11 L/min; captopril = 0.79 +/- 0.26 L/min). The slope of the response between MAP and LAP was similar in all animals, indicating that the agents have a similar effect on cardiac preload and afterload. The similar hemodynamic actions of RI and captopril in this model of congestive heart failure suggest that beneficial effects are due to inhibition of ANG II. Thus, orally active renin inhibitors may offer a useful therapeutic alternative when side effects preclude use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.",

They may also play a role in the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. In the present study, we compared systemic and regional hemodynamic effects of nonhypotensive doses of captopril and enalaprilate in normal rats, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), and rats with heart failure due to myocardial infarction (MI). Enalaprilate (0.1 mg/kg) or captopril (3 mg/kg) was injected intravenously (i.v.) in conscious rats equipped with miniature Doppler flow probes on renal and mesenteric artery and abdominal aorta or an electromagnetic flow probe on the ascending aorta to measure cardiac output (CO). This resulted in a shift of the angiotensin-I (ANG I) dose-pressor curve (ED50 of ANG I after saline 0.21 +/- 0.33 micrograms, enalaprilate 1.45 +/- 0.26 micrograms, captopril 2.38 +/- 0.73 micrograms; mean +/- SEM; n = 6-12). In the systemic hemodynamic groups, no significant changes in mean arterial pressure (MAP), CO, or total peripheral resistance (TPR) were observed.

Resistance in the hindquarters was not affected by ACE inhibitors, whereas only enalaprilate reduced mesenteric resistance in MI rats. In contrast, renal resistance was reduced and renal blood flow (RBF) increased after captopril in normal and MI rats and after enalaprilate in MI rats.

The Japanese multicenter study on the effect of beta-blockers revealed significant improvement of NYHA functional classification, LV end-diastolic dimension, ejection fraction, and exercise tolerance time in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. From our study using normal rabbits, metoprolol augmented adenylate cyclase activity without upregulation of the beta-adrenergic receptor number. Carteolol, a beta-adrenergic blocker with intrinsic sympathomimetic action, prevented the development of dilatation and hypertrophy of the heart in the chronic stage following murine encephalomyocarditis (EMC) viral myocarditis. Metoprolol exerted no such effect. Animal experiments indicated that immunosuppressive treatment for inflammatory myocarditis may aggravate the clinical course of the disease. However, immunosuppressive treatment in acute myocarditis should be reevaluated with the use of newly developed antiviral agents. A new synthetic immunoactive peptide FK 565, given before or simultaneously with viral inoculation, proved effective in inhibiting myocardial virus replication and myocardial damage in murine EMC viral myocarditis. Beneficial effects of captopril on survival rate and myocardial injury were demonstrated dose dependently in murine EMC viral myocarditis, even when the treatment was started around the peak of virus replication, namely, on day 4-14 after inoculation. Captopril may be promising for the treatment of acute myocarditis, and hopefully for prevention of the progression from myocarditis to dilated cardiomyopathy.",

Ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) was performed before and during treatment. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and HR were monitored under ambulatory conditions every five minutes for 24 hr with a finger volume oscillometric device. In all three groups, the mesor of MAP decreased significantly, while the amplitude and acrophase did not change during treatment. beta-Blockers reduced the amplitude as well as the mesor of HR. Ca channel blockers increased the amplitude of HR without influencing the mesor. ACE inhibitors had no effect on the circadian rhythm parameters of HR. These results suggest that Ca channel blockers, beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors lowered BP throughout the day without changing the circadian BP rhythm. However, the three drug classes may have different influences on the autonomic nervous system that regulates circadian cardiac rhythm.",

    "517": "Binding of 3H-dexamethasone and 3H-aldosterone by peripheral lymphocyte receptors was investigated in healthy persons and hypertensive patients before and after 2-week captopril treatment. The number of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid binding sites was increased in hypertensives vs normotensives. The treatment with the ACE inhibitor captopril led to activation of hormone-receptor interactions. There was a more marked rise of the number of receptors in middle-aged (44-55 years) hypertensives vs elderly (61-80 years) subjects after captopril treatment.", 
    "518": "The crucial issues in the management of congestive heart failure (CHF) are improvement of depressed myocardial contractility and reduction of excessive load. For this purpose, positive inotropic agents and vasodilators have been developed as new oral drugs. The former include Denopamine which possesses beta 1 stimulating effect, Xamoterol which is a unique agent acting as a beta 1-partial agonist, and Ibopamine, Docarpamine and Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors which possess both inotropic and vasodilating effects and are called \"Inodilators\". The latter include Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors. In addition, new vasodilators, such as, Vasopressin Antagonist have also been developed. However, careful long-term clinical trials are required with regard to the efficacy and adverse effects before these agents are widely used with safety in the management of CHF.", 
    "519": "Structural changes within the blood vessel wall such as hyperplasia and hypertrophy of vascular smooth muscle cells are important factors in the pathogenesis of hypertension. Humoral growth factors such as angiotensin II (AII) and platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB) may participate in the remodelling of the blood vessel wall. Whether and by which mechanisms antihypertensive treatment is capable of influencing the structural blood vessel alterations to date remains unclear. In the present study, the effect of nifedipine and diltiazem on AII- and PDGF-BB-induced vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation was examined. Nifedipine and diltiazem at a concentration of 10 microM did not affect baseline DNA synthesis in isolated vascular smooth muscle cells in culture. AII (final concentration 100 nM) and PDGF-BB (50 ng/ml) stimulated DNA synthesis by approximately 9.0- and 4.6-fold, respectively. Both AII- and PDGF-BB-induced DNA synthesis was significantly blunted by diltiazem and nifedipine in a concentration of 10 microM, while no significant influence was seen with concentrations from 10 nM up to 1 microM. In contrast, no significant influence of these drugs could be observed on fetal calf serum 5%-induced DNA synthesis. The findings indicate that calcium antagonists possess antimitogenic potential and that they may thus contribute to the regression of structural changes of the blood vessels associated with hypertension.", 
    "520": "The goal of the present study was to show that, in contrast to an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, Ro 42-5892, a new renin inhibitor, can block the renin-angiotensin system without potentiating skin reactions induced by bradykinin.", 
    "521": "Potentiation of skin reaction to i.d. injections of bradykinin and histamine was evaluated in guinea pigs in the presence and absence of the drug (placebo, Ro 42-5892 or cilazapril). The elimination rate of radioactive bradykinin in blood was measured in other groups of guinea pigs treated with the same drugs. Maximal effective doses of each drug were used.", 
    "522": "Measurements of erythema area induced by bradykinin and histamine injection were performed using a digital planimeter. Radioactive bradykinin was measured in blood by high-performance liquid chromatography and followed over 40 min.", 
    "523": "The ACE inhibitor cilazapril increased the area of erythema induced by bradykinin but not that induced by histamine. In contrast, Ro 42-5892 did not potentiate the effect of bradykinin. In addition, cilazapril did not change the elimination rate of i.v. radioactive bradykinin in blood.", 
    "524": "These results suggest that potentiation of bradykinin-induced skin reaction by cilazapril is due to a tissular (and not systemic) inhibition of ACE and does not occur with Ro 42-5892. Thus, side effects such as rash, angioneurotic edema or cough, which have been attributed to bradykinin accumulation by ACE inhibitors, may not occur with the use of specific renin inhibitors such as Ro 42-5892.", 
    "525": "1. The effect of administration of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), lisinopril (Carace; 10-40 mg twice daily) and the calcium channel blocker, nifedipine (Adalat Retard; 20-40 mg twice daily) on ex vivo [45Ca2+] uptake by platelets from hypertensive diabetic (type 1 and 2) patients was investigated. 2. At the end of at least 3 months treatment, blood was collected prior to the patient taking the morning dose of medication and washed platelets prepared. [45Ca2+] uptake was monitored following the addition of adrenaline, isoprenaline and dibutyryl cAMP (dbcAMP), as well as in unstimulated (zero) platelets. 3. Both nifedipine and lisinopril significantly inhibited the ex vivo uptake of [45Ca2+] by platelets when this process was stimulated by adrenaline, isoprenaline and dibutyryl cAMP. Basal uptake was also inhibited in both groups. 4. These data consolidate the hypothesis that ACE inhibitors may possess calcium channel/calcium mobilisation blocking properties. Apart from its hypertensive action, lisinopril may also reduce platelet activity via modulation of calcium dynamics, thereby reducing the incidence of vascular complications associated with diabetes mellitus."
