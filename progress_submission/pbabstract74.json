ACE inhibitors have assumed a vital role in the treatment of patients with ventricular dysfunction, including those who have sustained one or more myocardial infarctions. The greatest benefits appear over time and not unexpectedly are most pronounced in cases of moderate to severe reduction in left ventricular performance. Emerging evidence suggests that the paradigm for ACE inhibitor use will expand even further, opening new doors for patient care.",

However, the effect was not found in patients with more advanced heart failure. Coinfusion of enalaprilat did not enhance sodium nitroprusside-induced vasodilation in any of the groups. To explore the mechanism of the inhibitor's effect, an additional 20 patients with mild heart failure (functional class II) were pretreated with a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, acetylsalicylic acid (n = 10) or an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthesis, NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (n = 10), followed by administration of acetylcholine with or without enalaprilat. Acetylsalicylic acid reduced the converting enzyme inhibitor's effect, whereas NG-monomethyl-L-arginine failed to block the augmentation of blood flow.",

    "6": "Increased glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure (PGC) is an important hemodynamic determinant of glomerular injury, but the molecular events responsible for this association are poorly understood. PGC is normal in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), but uninephrectomy leads to an increase in PGC and accelerated glomerulosclerosis. Since recent studies have implicated transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) and platelet-derived growth factor sought to determine if uninephrectomy increased mRNA levels for TGF-beta 1 and PDGF in glomeruli of SHR. Since treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril lowers PGC and prevents glomerulosclerosis in uninephrectomized SHR, we also sought to determine if ACE inhibitor lowered mRNA levels for TGF-beta 1 and PDGF in the glomeruli of uninephrectomized SHR. PGC increased from 53 +/- 1 to 64 +/- 1 mm Hg 1 week after uninephrectomy in SHR (P < .05). The increase in PGC was associated with a sixfold rise in mRNA levels for TGF-beta 1 and a twofold rise in mRNA levels for PDGF in glomeruli. mRNA levels for PDGF returned to normal 2 weeks after nephrectomy, but the increase in mRNA levels for TGF-beta 1 was sustained. An increase in TGF-beta 1 immunostaining was detectable in glomeruli 4 weeks after nephrectomy. Treatment with ACE inhibitor normalized PGC (51 +/- 1 mm Hg) and prevented the rise in glomerular mRNA levels for TGF-beta 1 and PDGF. We conclude that an acute increase in PGC leads to increased TGF-beta 1 and PDGF expression in the glomerulus, thus linking changes in PGC to cytokine gene expression.", 
    "7": "Acute unilateral ureteral obstruction (AUUO) has been associated to a blood pressure increase, presumably secondary to activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), since the obstructed kidney increases renin secretion (Ref. 8). In an attempt to delineate the role of the RAS in this hypertensive model, we acutely obstructed the ureter in two groups of dogs that previous to the obstruction received either placebo (G I, n = 8) or 50 mg of captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (G II, n = 9). Animals that received placebo showed a consistent increase in mean arterial pressure (MAP), 128 +/- 4 vs. 144 +/- 4 mm Hg (p < 0.001); those that received captopril did not show such a tendency: 135 +/- 7 vs. 135 +/- 7 mm Hg. In further studies, three groups of animals were included: group III (G III, n = 4), identical to G I except that plasma renin activity (PRA) and aldosterone (ALDO) were measured; Group IV (G IV, n = 5), identical to G II except that they received 50 mg of indomethacin, 60 min before captopril; and group V (G V, n = 6), which was sham operated and measured for PRA and ALDO.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "8": "This study tested the efficacy of high resolution miniature transesophageal echocardiography (m-TEE; 3.5 mm-diameter probe, 7.5 MHz, axial resolution of 0.25 mm) in the evaluation of atherosclerotic lesions of the thoracic aorta rabbits exposed to a high cholesterol diet. The effects of the ACE inhibitor Alacepril (90 mg/kg) on atherosclerosis were also assessed in normotensive, high cholesterol-diet rabbits by m-TEE, both in situ and in vitro. Oral treatment with Alacepril was begun on confirmation of atherosclerosis after a three month high cholesterol diet (group AL). Ultrasound examination reliably distinguished the lesions of atherosclerosis in situ. A three month course of Alacepril treatment decreased the systolic and diastolic blood pressures by approximately 20 and 5 mmHg, produced a regression of atherosclerosis and significantly decreased the intimal plus medial thickness compared with hyperlipidemic-controls (group HC) (1.0 + 0.3 vs 1.6 + 0.4 mm, p < 0.02). The intimal surface involvement area in group AL was marginally smaller than in group HC (57 + 23 vs 76 + 23%, p = 0.06). The high dose of Alacepril in this study did not affect the serum levels of t-cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C, triglycerides, or apoproteins A-I and B. These results suggest that Alacepril can produce regression of atherosclerosis, without changing circulating lipoprotein or apoprotein levels. Further miniature TEE offers high repeatability and is useful both in situ and in vitro for determining changes in arterial wall thickness and the severity of atherosclerosis.",

Rat atrial natriuretic peptide, rANP-99-126 (rANP) inhibited stimulated SCC and Jw to submaximal concentrations of arginine vasotocin (AVT) at a site before cyclic AMP generation.

The study was conducted as a double-blind, cross-over comparison of idrapril calcium against placebo. Plasma concentrations of idrapril were determined by an indirect enzymatic method. Urinary concentrations were measured by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (h.p.l.c.). Plasma samples were also analysed for ACE activity. The pharmacokinetics of idrapril calcium did not change significantly between day 1 and day 5. The values of Cmax and AUC were dose-related over the range of doses tested; tmax was 3-4 h and apparent elimination half-life was 1.4-1.6 h. Plasma ACE activity was maximally inhibited (94-96%) at all dose levels and remained more than 80% depressed from 2 to at least 6 h after idrapril calcium. Although the maximum effect was not dose-related, the duration of inhibition showed some dose-dependency, ACE activity returning to 56, 45 and 29% of the basal value 12 h after the 100, 200 and 400 mg doses, respectively. There were no clinically significant adverse events experienced by the volunteers. No dose-related effects on blood pressure or heart rate were observed. There were no changes in clinical pathology tests, urine analyses or electrocardiograms after dosing with idrapril calcium. Idrapril calcium, the prototype of a new class of ACE inhibitors, appears to be well-tolerated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

We have evaluated the effects of orally administered enalapril on angiotensin II induced vasoconstriction in the human forearm. Subjects received in random order, enalapril (20 mg) or matched placebo daily for 2 weeks. Forearm blood flow response to increasing doses of angiotensin II was measured using venous occlusion plethysmography at the beginning of the study and at the end of each 2 week treatment period. Treatment with enalapril significantly reduced plasma angiotensin II levels and supine blood pressure compared with placebo. The percentage reductions in forearm blood flow in the infused arm, in response to the maximum dose of angiotensin II (50,000 fmol min-1) were 48.1 +/- 3.6% at baseline, 57.5 +/- 3.6% on placebo and 54.5 +/- 4.2% on enalapril. The differences were not significantly different. This demonstrates that suppression of plasma angiotensin II for a 14 day period does not enhance the response to exogenous intra-arterial angiotensin II in the human forearm of healthy salt replete subjects.", 
    "12": "Extracellular levels of dynorphin B were analysed with in vivo microdialysis in the neostriatum and substantia nigra of halothane-anaesthetized rats. Dopamine and its metabolites, 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl-acetic acid and homovanillic acid, as well as GABA were simultaneously monitored. Chromatographic analysis revealed that the dynorphin B-like immunoreactivity measured in perfusates collected under basal and K(+)-depolarizing conditions co-eluted with synthetic dynorphin B. Dynorphin B, GABA and dopamine levels were Ca(2+)-dependently increased by K(+)-depolarization, while 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and homovanillic acid levels were decreased. Dopamine and its metabolites, but not dynorphin B or GABA levels, were significantly decreased after a unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine injection into the left medial forebrain bundle. In contrast, following a unilateral injection of ibotenic acid into the striatum, dynorphin B and GABA levels were decreased by > 50% in striatum and substantia nigra on the lesioned side, whereas no significant changes were observed in basal dopamine levels. The inclusion of the peptidase inhibitor captopril (50-500 microM) into the nigral perfusion medium produced a concentration-dependent increase in nigral extracellular levels of dynorphin B. In the striatum, a delayed increase in dynorphin B and GABA levels could be observed following the nigral captopril administration, but this effect was not concentration-dependent. Thus, we demonstrate that extracellular levels of dynorphin B, dopamine and GABA can simultaneously be monitored with in vivo microdialysis. Extracellular dynorphin B appears to originate from neurons, since the levels were (i) increased in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner by K(+)-depolarization, and (ii) decreased by a selective lesion of the striatum, known to contain cell bodies of dynorphin neurons in the striatonigral pathway. Furthermore, (iii) the increase in nigral dynorphin B levels by peptidase inhibition suggests the presence of clearance mechanisms for the released dynorphin peptides.",

A typical dry cough is the main cause for discontinuation of ACE-I therapy. Data about the incidence, course, and clinical significance of this side effect are conflicting. This study determined the incidence of cough in ACE-I treated patients with hypertension and with CHF and to appreciate its clinical significance; 268 ACE-I treated patients, 164 with hypertension and 104 with CHF were prospectively followed for at least 1 year and specifically questioned about cough and other side effects. In those in whom cough developed, a second and then a third ACE-I were tried. Cough developed in 50 (18.6%) of the 268 patients; 23 patients with hypertension (14%) had coughs 24.7 +/- 17.1 (SD) weeks after initiation of therapy; 27 patients with CHF (26%) had coughs 12.3 +/- 12 (SD) weeks after the start of ACE-I therapy (P = 0.005). All but three patients had coughs also on the second and third ACE-I. The time from the beginning of therapy to the onset of cough was significantly shorter with the second than the first drug. ACE-I agents had to be discontinued in 50% of the patients in whom coughs developed, most of them in the CHF group. In the others, cough was well tolerated or disappeared during subsequent months.

In patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, kinin-related effects have been postulated repeatedly, but information on changes in plasma kinin levels in these patients is sparse. Difficulties in the measurement of plasma kinins account for this, at least in part. 2. The main purpose of the present study was to investigate, in normal human subjects, the effect of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor quinapril on plasma kinins. 3. High-affinity antisera (Kd < 10(-11) mol/l) of C-terminal specificity were raised in rabbits for radioimmunoassay of immunoreactive kinins activating the bradykinin B2-receptor, and three different liquid- and solid-phase extraction methods for plasma kinins were evaluated. Ethanol and subsequent petroleum ether extraction of 5-40 fmol of bradykinin added to plasma yielded recoveries of 39 +/- 16% (mean +/- SD); normal kinin levels in human plasma were 18.6 +/- 3.3 pmol/l (mean +/- SEM). Solid-phase extraction on urea-equilibrated phenylsilylsilica produced recoveries of 89 +/- 5% and normal values of 36.4 +/- 18 pmol/l. Finally, with an assay based on ethanol extraction alone, recoveries of 100 +/- 16% and normal values of 16.8 +/- 5.8 pmol/l were obtained, with a detection limit of 1.5 fmol/ml of plasma. Blanks were below the detection limit. Serial dilution of plasma extracts (n = 4) provided linear kinin concentrations (r = 0.99).

    "26": "The essential goal of medical treatment following myocardial infarction with left ventricular dysfunction must be the prevention of secondary cardiac failure. The existence of left ventricular dysfunction, in particular when it is not accompanied by clinical cardiac failure, is a virtually formal indication for beta-blocker treatment after an infarction. Beta-blockers with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) are possibly better tolerated in this context. However, experience shows that cardiologists and general practitioners often remain reluctant to prescribe beta-blockers whenever left ventricular function is impaired. Converting enzyme inhibitors decrease the risk of onset of secondary cardiac failure, reduce sudden deaths by ventricular arrhythmias, reduce recurrences of myocardial infarction or unstable coronary insufficiency, and more generally reduce overall and cardiovascular mortality. This is a class effect. While there is no urgency to prescribe them during the acute phase, it is generally considered that it is extremely useful to give them fairly quickly, i.e. during the first 72 hours. At the end of the hospital phase, around two weeks, it is desirable, whenever possible, to prescribe a dose of the order of 75 mg/day of captopril or 2.5 mg/day of ramipril. The administration of aspirin can be considered virtually routine. Oral anticoagulants are desirable in the presence of a large akinetic pocket, a frequent starting point of thrombosis and/or systemic emboli, or in the presence of atrial fibrillation. Digitalis/diuretic treatment does not appear to be indicated at this stage. Other types of anti-ischemic treatment are not theoretically indicated as a matter of principle at this stage in the absence of residual ischemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "27": "1. The effects of the beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist, procaterol, on sympathetic neuroeffector transmission were studied in the pithed adrenal demedullated rat to determine if generation of angiotensin II was involved in its effect. Pressor responses were elicited by either electrical stimulation (20 V, 2 Hz) of the entire spinal sympathetic outflow or methoxamine (0.1 mg kg-1, i.v.). 2. Sodium nitroprusside (3 and 5 micrograms kg-1 min-1, i.v.) produced hypotension and the pressor responses to both sympathetic nerve stimulation and methoxamine were reduced. This indicates that decreasing blood pressure in pithed rats reduces pressor responses. Procaterol (10 and 30 ng kg-1 min-1, i.v.) also produced hypotension but did not alter pressor responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation. Nevertheless, procaterol (10 and 30 ng kg-1 min-1, i.v.) did reduce pressor responses to to methoxamine. Together these results suggest that procaterol may have enhanced sympathetic neurotransmitter release. This was confirmed in another series of experiments where procaterol (30 ng kg-1 min-1, i.v.) increased plasma noradrenaline levels during sympathetic nerve stimulation. 3. Captopril (5 mg kg-1, i.v.) produced hypotension and as expected reduced pressor responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation. When the hypotensive effect of captopril was abolished by concomitant vasopressin infusion (1.5-4.5 i mu kg-1 min-1, i.v.), pressor responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation were restored to pre-captopril levels. In this situation procaterol (10 and 30 ng kg-' min', i.v.) reduced basal blood pressure and did not alter pressor responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation whereas the pressor responses were reduced by an equihypotensive infusion of sodium nitroprusside (3 and 5 jig kg-' min' , i.v.). The lack of reduction of pressor responses after procaterol in the presence of captopril is indirect evidence that procaterol may have enhanced noradrenaline release independently of angiotensin II.4. In another series of experiments, plasma noradrenaline levels elicited by sympathetic nerve stimulation were not altered by captopril (5 mg kg', i.v.). In the presence of captopril (5 mg kg-', i.v.),procaterol (30 ng kg- min-1, i.v.) no longer enhanced plasma noradrenaline levels during sympathetic nerve stimulation. However, since the dose of captopril is well above that required to block angiotens in converting enzyme (ACE) the effect may be non-specific. Therefore, the selective AT, receptor antagonist, losartan (10mgkg'1, i.v.), was also used. Losartan (10mgkg'1, i.v.) did not alter plasma noradrenaline levels during sympathetic nerve stimulation, and in the presence of losartan procaterol(30 ng kg-I min-', i.v.) enhanced plasma noradrenaline levels during sympathetic nerve stimulation. This result further suggests that 1-adrenoceptor facilitation of noradrenaline release from sympathetic nerves in the pithed rat occurs by a mechanism independent of angiotensin II generation.", 
    "28": "1. The aim of this study was to determine the participation of endogenous bradykinin (BK) in the antihypertensive effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), perindoprilat, in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) on different salt diets. 2. Conscious SHRs receiving either a low or a high NaCl diet were used in order to evaluate the respective roles of angiotensin II suppression and bradykinin stimulation in the acute hypotensive effects of perindoprilat. Two different B2 receptor antagonists (B 4146 and Hoe 140) were used after bolus administration of 7 mg kg-1 of the ACEI, perindoprilat. In separate animals, Hoe 140 was administered before the injection of perindoprilat. In other experiments, the effects of Hoe 140 on the hypotensive effects of the calcium antagonist, nicardipine, were tested. 3. The different NaCl diets had no effect on baseline blood pressure. Hoe 140 injection before ACE inhibition did not modify blood pressure. Perindoprilat caused more marked hypotension in the low salt-fed rats than in the high salt animals (P < 0.01). Administration of Hoe 140 or B4146 after perindoprilat significantly reduced the antihypertensive effects of perindoprilat in the different groups, but this effect was more pronounced in high salt-fed rats. However, in SHRs receiving Hoe 140 before perindoprilat, the antihypertensive effect of perindoprilat was completely abolished in both high or low salt diet rats. In separate experiments we confirmed that Hoe 140 did not affect the hypotensive efficacy of the calcium antagonist, nicardipine. 4. Our study shows that inhibition of endogenous bradykinin degradation participates in the acute antihypertensive effects of perindoprilat in SHRs. The role of bradykinin is more pronounced following exposure to a high salt diet i.e., when the renin-angiotensin system is suppressed. Blockade of bradykinin B2 receptors by Hoe 140 before administration of perindoprilat completely abolished the hypotensive effect of perindoprilat suggesting an increased role of bradykinin in the onset of hypotensive action of ACE inhibitors. However, the exact mechanism of this interaction remains unclear.", 
    "29": "Twenty patients with essential hypertension were randomised to a 7-week period of dose titration with doxazosin, 1-8mg/day or enalapril, 5-20mg/day. In a further 7-week period the dosage level reached with the initial drug was halved, and titration with the second agent was carried out. Blood pressure responses at the end of each treatment period were assessed by clinic measurements made 24 hours post-dose. In the first treatment period, enalapril (mean dose 19mg/day) reduced serum free ACE activity by 40% and had a greater effect than doxazosin (mean dose 5.2mg/day) on clinic supine blood pressure (systolic and diastolic). In the second period, the addition of enalapril to doxazosin was associated with a significant fall in clinic standing blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), despite the doxazosin dose reduction and consequent decrease in median plasma doxazosin concentration (from 10.6 to 5.2ng/ml). Alternatively, when doxazosin was added to enalapril, free ACE activity remained 40% decreased despite enalapril dose reduction, and blood pressure was not further affected. Plasma renin activity was increased by enalapril. No changes were observed in plasma aldosterone or lipid concentrations with either drug. The combination of doxazosin and enalapril was well tolerated and lowered blood pressure overall. Judged by clinic measurements 24 hours post-dose, most of the antihypertensive effect was attributable to the enalapril component. However, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring 0-12 hours post-dose in a subset of patients suggested a contribution of doxazosin earlier in the dose interval.", 
    "30": "It is well-established that administration of moderate doses of the adrenal catecholamines epinephrine or norepinephrine shortly after training results in the enhancement of later retention performance in laboratory animals. These substances, released endogenously as a result of arousal, are thought to modulate memory processes by stimulating peripheral receptors that send neural messages to the brain, thus altering the memory storage process. The applicability of this hypothesis to the modulation of memory processes in humans was tested in this experiment by using elderly subjects who were chronically taking beta-receptor antagonist medications to control hypertension. A moderate level of muscle-tension-induced arousal was produced by having subjects squeeze a hand dynamometer during the initial storage and recall of highlighted words in short 200-word paragraphs. Twenty young normal individuals, 22 normotensive elderly subjects, 21 elderly subjects taking either calcium-channel blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors to control hypertension, and 21 elderly subjects taking beta-blocker antihypertensive medications served as subjects. The young subjects, normal elderly subjects, and those taking non-beta-blocker medications all showed enhanced long-term recognition performance as a result of the arousal manipulation.

Hematocrit increased by at least 0.04 in 13 patients ('responders') but changed by -0.08 to 0.01 in five patients ('nonresponders'). In the responder subgroup, hematocrit increased from 0.43 +/- 0.05 to 0.51 +/- 0.05 (P < 0.001), red cell mass increased from 25.4 +/- 5.9 to 28.9 +/- 5.9 ml/kg body weight (P < 0.001), and transferrin saturation decreased from 41 +/- 16 to 27 +/- 9 percent (P < 0.01). Reticulocyte count increased two weeks after withdrawal of enalapril. Plasma volume did not change significantly. No measurement changed in the nonresponder subgroup. Plasma levels of erythropoietin, total erythroid stimulating activity, insulin-like growth factor I, and angiotensin II did not change significantly in either subgroup. Enalaprilat did not inhibit erythropoiesis in cell culture. Thus, erythropoiesis increased in 13 of 18 patients after stopping enalapril and was independent of changes in circulating concentrations of several erythropoietic factors, including erythropoietin. The pathogenesis of PTE and mechanism underlying the beneficial effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition remain undetermined.", 
    "32": "Recent evidence indicates that transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) plays an important role in renal fibrosis via stimulation of extracellular matrix synthesis. The present study was undertaken to investigate the role of angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1 receptor) in hypertension-induced renal injury. Twenty-two-week-old stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP), which had established hypertension and moderate renal damage, were orally given TCV-116, a selective non-peptide AT1 receptor antagonist (0.1, 1 or 10 mg/kg/day), enalapril (10 mg/kg/day) or vehicle once a day for 10 weeks. At the end point of the treatment, we examined renal function, the gene expressions of TGF-beta 1 and extracellular matrix components in the interstitium [collagen types I (COI) and III (COIII), fibronectin (FN)] and the basement membrane (COIV and laminin), and renal microscopic morphology in rats aged 32 weeks. In vehicle-treated 32 week-old SHRSP with renal dysfunction and nephrosclerosis, renal mRNA levels for TGF-beta 1, COI, COIII, FN, COIV were all several-fold higher than in WKY. Thus, renal TGF-beta 1 gene expression was enhanced in SHRSP, which may contribute to the increased renal expressions of COI, COIII, FN, COIV in SHRSP. Treatment with TCV-116 (0.1 mg/kg/day) in SHRSP, in spite of no reduction of blood pressure, decreased renal mRNA levels for TGF-beta 1, COI, COIII, FN, COIV, being accompanied by the significant decrease in urinary protein and albumin excretion, blood urea nitrogen and plasma creatinine. Treatment with TCV-116 (10 mg/kg/day) in SHRSP decreased mRNAs for TGF-beta 1, COI, COIII, FN and COIV to almost the same levels as WKY, being associated with normalization of urinary protein and albumin excretion and the prevention of nephrosclerosis, as judged by microscopic histological observations. On the other hand, the effects of enalapril (10 mg/kg/day) on the above mentioned mRNA levels, renal function and renal morphology were weaker than those of TCV-116 (10 mg/kg/day) and were as much as TCV-116 (1 mg/kg/day). These results suggest that independently of hypotensive action, AT1 receptor antagonist has a potent renal protective effect by inhibiting the gene expression of renal TGF-beta 1 and extracellular matrix components.", 
    "33": "To investigate the effects of enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide on erythrocyte sodium and potassium in relation to their effects on BP, 28 men (mean age 46 years, range 22-64 years) with previously untreated essential hypertension (casual DBP > or = 95 mmHg) were randomised to enalapril (n = 14) or hydrochlorothiazide (n = 14) treatment. BP was also measured intraarterially (brachial artery) and the mean arterial pressure (MAP) recorded. Intraerythrocyte sodium and potassium were measured by flame photometry at baseline and after 26 weeks of active treatment in the hypertensive patients and also in 28 age- and sex-matched normotensive control subjects. There was a significant positive relationship between intra-arterial BP and intraerythrocyte sodium in untreated hypertensives, but there was no significant difference in mean intraerythrocyte sodium or potassium content between hypertensive and normotensive subjects at baseline. The distribution of values of intraerythrocyte sodium, however, differed between hypertensive and normotensive subjects. Supine MAP was lowered from 113 +/- 4 to 97 +/- 3 mmHg and from 110 +/- 3 to 102 +/- 2 mmHg on enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide treatment, respectively. BP reduction with enalapril was associated with a significant decrease in intraerythrocyte sodium (P = 0.02), while hydrochlorothiazide had no effect. There was no significant correlation between delta MAP and delta intraerythrocyte sodium after 26 weeks in any of the groups. Intraerythrocyte potassium did not change on treatment with either drug. In conclusion, there wa a significant relationship between intra-arterial BP and intraerythrocyte sodium in untreated hypertensives. Both enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide reduced BP effectively while enalapril only reduced intraerythrocyte sodium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "41": "In twelve hypertensive patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) due to chronic glomerulonephritis (CGN), the mechanisms of renin and aldosterone regulation were studied by exogenously infused angiotensin II, captopril, and upright posture. The results were compared to those obtained in ten patients with unilateral renovascular hypertension (RVH), eleven patients with essential hypertension (EH), and in eleven normal subjects (NS). Exogenously infused angiotensin II (5.0 ng/kg/min) failed to decrease the plasma renin activity (PRA) in the ESRD group but significantly decreased the PRA in the RVH, EH, and NS groups. The plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) in the ESRD group and in the other control groups significantly increased after the addition of exogenous angiotensin II. An oral dose of 50 mg of captopril failed to increase the PRA in the ESRD group. However, it significantly raised the PRA in the RVH, EH, and NS groups. The plasma aldosterone concentration was significantly reduced by captopril in the ESRD group, and similar results were obtained in the other three groups. The ratio between the PRA before and after being in an upright posture for 4 hours in the ESRD group was lower than that in the three other groups. Meanwhile, there was no difference in the PAC ratio between the ESRD group and the control groups. Thus, we conclude that, in hypertensive patients with ESRD due to CGN, PRA regulation is different from that in the other three groups, although there were no differences in the regulation of the PAC among the four groups, suggesting that renin production in the ESRD group is somewhat autonomous.",

Two patients withdrew from the enalapril group and 8 from the diltiazem group. No unexpected side-effects were seen during the study and no deaths occurred in any treatment group. Twice-daily sustained-release diltiazem 120 or 180 mg was shown to be an effective antihypertensive agent and equal in efficacy and patient acceptability to once-daily enalapril 10 or 20 mg.

The choice of treatments available for its treatment was largely limited to diuretics and some accepted beta-adrenergic blockers. It is only 4 years since the choice was extended to the calcium-channel-blockers and the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, in civil aviation. In military aviation in the U.K., ACE inhibitors have been in use for less than 2 years. This paper surveys these choices and makes the case for the use of ACE-inhibitors, under controlled conditions. It also emphasizes that the functional studies, conducted to show the safety of ACE-inhibitors, were more comprehensive than for any of the predecessors. These methods of study should serve as models for the study of any drug in the future, before it is authorized for use in the aircrew.", 
    "49": "Left ventricular (LV) function and plasma levels of cardiovascular hormones were examined in patients with severe chronic congestive heart failure (CHF), randomized to placebo or enalapril, in addition to conventional therapy. M-mode echocardiography and plasma hormone concentrations were available at baseline and after 6 weeks of treatment. There was a significant relationship between LV systolic function and levels of angiotensin-II and norepinephrine. Enalapril increased LV fractional shortening (FS%) (13.3 +/- 5.6 to 15.4 +/- 5.8, p < 0.05) and decreased the systolic time interval index (0.58 +/- 0.14 to 0.48 +/- 0.15, p < 0.05) concurrent with a significant decrease in angiotensin-converting enzyme activity and in aldosterone, angiotensin-II, and norepinephrine concentrations after 6 weeks. No changes were found in the placebo group. However, there was no direct relationship between the amount of change in neurohormones and improvement in LV function after 6 weeks. These findings indicate that in patients with severe chronic CHF, severe LV systolic dysfunction is associated with high plasma levels of angiotensin-II and norepinephrine, which can be favorably modified by enalapril. This may be of importance for prolonging life in severe heart failure. The lack of relationship between changes in individual hormones and systolic function suggests complex dynamic interaction. It is, therefore, not sufficient to predict changes in LV function by measuring changes in only one hormone.", 
    "50": "The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is one of the main systems involved in the regulation of blood pressure and sodium homeostasis. In animal experiments and in humans, the plasma renin activity and aldosterone levels are reduced with aging. The age-related differences in plasma renin activity and aldosterone are more pronounced in stimulated conditions (when sitting in an upright position, when salt intake is restricted and when plasma volume is depleted) than under basal conditions. Age-related alterations of the kidney (glomerulosclerosis, decreased number of functional nephrons) might account for the age-related differences in the active to inactive plasma renin ratio. In the same way, a diminished synthesis of angiotensinogen by the liver could contribute to the decrease in the activity of the RAAS in aging. This is partially compensated for by increases in the density of angiotensin II receptors reported in elderly patients. Furthermore, aging is associated with a reduced adrenal responsiveness to angiotensin II, contributing to lower production of aldosterone and alterations of sodium homeostasis. Estradiol and progesterone help stimulate the secretion of renin. Reduced levels of these hormones at menopause also lead to reduced plasma renin activity. In relation to these findings, several studies have shown that reductions in blood pressure, induced by short or long term treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, were more pronounced in old than young hypertensive patients. An insertion/deletion polymorphism in the ACE gene has been described; the genotype deletion/deletion of this gene has been reported to be closely associated with longevity. This result was unexpected since the same deletion polymorphism was also shown to represent a potent risk factor for myocardial infarction.",

Of the 38 subjects, 18 were designated as the control hypercholesterol group (CH) and 20 received oral alacepril at 90 mg/day (ACE) for 13-22 weeks. Three rabbits in each group died due to pneumonia. TEE enabled a clear diagnosis as either normal, early stage or late stage of atherosclerosis. The intimal-medial thickness was significantly less in the ACE group than in the CH group, but only over the middle portion of the aorta. The ACE group had a smaller area of atheromatous plaque than the CH group (atheromatous index: 37 +/- 20* and 60 +/- 30% respectively, *p < 0.02). Serum cholesterol and triglycerides were similar in the CH group (1590 +/- 653, 258 +/- 224) and the ACE group (1574 +/- 824, 303 +/- 360 respectively). In conclusion, alacepril reduced both the area of atheromatous atheroma plaque and wall hypertrophy independent of serum lipids in cholesterol-fed rabbits.

Blood flow in the kidney, right ventricle, small intestine of the heart failure rats treated was increased. In sham-operated animals, perindopril reduced mean blood pressure, cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, systolic pressure, diastolic pressure and unchanged renal blood flow.

    "60": "Measurement of plasma methoxyamines is aimed to provide a reliable plasma marker readily available for any patient suspected of having a pheochromocytoma. The present HPLC method is able to detect methoxyamine amounts as low as 0.2 nmoles/l and allows the determination of both free or conjugated methoxyamines (metanephrine MN and normetanephrine NMN) in normal subjects, treated or untreated patients and a fortiori in pheochromocytoma. The analytical specificity is excellent. Among most usual antihypertensive drugs, only conversion enzyme inhibitors and diuretics induce in some patients a moderate increase of NMN with minor consequence in values interpretation. The kidney plays a major role in the blood clearance of methoxyamines and any alteration of renal function is associated to the increase of plasma methoxyamine levels. Plasma methoxyamines have a long half-life and are long-lasting integrated markers of catecholamine secretion; at variance with plasma free catecholamines, they are able to afford the presence of a secreting pheochromocytoma whatever the clinical presentation--asymptomatic or paroxysmal form between the crisis.

    "61": "The ex vivo effects of perindopril and enalapril, inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), were studied on rat aortae and perfused hearts to clarify the inhibition of vascular response to angiotensin I. The duration of the effects of these inhibitors was also studied. One hour after oral administration of perindopril (0.1-30 mg/kg) or enalapril (0.3-100 mg/kg), the aortae and hearts were isolated for the measurement of isometric force and coronary flow, respectively. In aortae, perindopril and enalapril dose-dependently inhibited the maximal contractions to angiotensin I (1-1000 nM). In isolated perfused hearts, the compounds inhibited the decrease in coronary flow induced by angiotensin I (100 ng). In other experiments, the inhibitory effects of perindopril lasted for 24 h in both aortae (3 mg/kg, p.o.) and hearts (10 mg/kg, p.o.). In contrast, the effects of enalapril disappeared within 6 h in aortae (3 mg/kg, p.o.) and 12 h in hearts (100 mg/kg, p.o.). These results demonstrate that oral administration of ACE inhibitors reduce the ex vivo vascular response to angiotensin I and suggest that perindopril is a longer-lasting inhibitor than enalapril on vascular contraction to locally generated angiotensin II.",

    "63": "In moderate congestive heart failure pulmonary overhydration may be detected at chest X-ray even if therapy is optimized to keep the urinary output normal and to prevent weight gain and dependent edema formation. Removal of overhydration of the lung may help to define its significance. This study was aimed at investigating whether a subclinical accumulation of fluid in the lung interstitium in moderate congestive heart failure interferes with the patient's functional capacity, and whether furosemide is able to promote reabsorption of the excessive fluid. Patients whose digoxin, oral furosemide and ACE-inhibitor therapeutic regimen was kept constant, were randomly allocated to ultrafiltration (8 cases) or iv bolus (mean dose = 248 mg) of supplemental furosemide (8 cases). The amount of body fluid removed with each method approximated 1.600 ml. Functional performance was assessed with cardiopulmonary exercise tests. Soon after fluid withdrawal with either procedure the filling pressures of the two ventricles and body weight were reduced and plasma renin activity, norepinephrine and aldosterone were augmented. After furosemide hormones remained elevated in the subsequent 4 days, and, during this period, patients had positive water metabolism, recovery of the elevated ventricular filling pressures, recurrence of lung congestion without any improvement in functional capacity. In ultrafiltrated patients, renin, norepinephrine and aldosterone fell below control values within the first 48 hours and water metabolism was equilibrated at a new set point (less fluid intake and diuresis without weight gain). Functional capacity in these patients was improved through favorable circulatory and ventilatory adjustments consequent on reabsorption of lung water. This may also have restored the ability of the lung to clear norepinephrine, thus restraining its facilitation of renin release. Improvement persisted at 3 months after the procedure. In congestive heart failure the set point of fluid balance is altered despite oral furosemide; supplemental iv furosemide does not shift the set point, at least in the presence of ACE-inhibition; excessive, although silent, lung water limits the functional capacity of the patient.",

Stress cardiac function was assessed by the development of LVdp/dtmax in response to incremental pressure load (phenylephrine, Phe) and volume load (dextran, Dex). The slope of delta HR/delta MAP relationship curve was used as an index of baroceptor sensitivity. Results showed that both Cap and Clo caused decreases in BP in SHR. Cap not only reduced markedly the left ventricular mass/body weight (LVM/BW), (mg.g-1, 2.7 +/- 0.4 vs SHR 3.5 +/- 0.3, P < 0.01), but also normalized the LVdp/dtmax, -LVdp/dtmax, T value, and the stress cardiac function. Clo neither decreased the LVM/BW (mg.g-1, 3.4 +/- 0.5 vs SHR 3.5 +/- 0.3, P > 0.05), nor improved the resting and stress cardiac function.

The single clone identified stimulated uptake of cefadroxil into oocytes about 50-fold at pH 6.5. Kinetic analysis of expressed transport activity revealed a saturable transport system shared by amino beta-lactam antibiotics, dipeptides and selected angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Evidence for rheogenic cefadroxil/H(+)-cotransport was obtained by a) The demonstration that cefadroxil influx increased the inward current in oocytes clamped at a holding potential of -60 mV in sodium-free medium and b) A decrease of intracellular pH in oocytes caused by cefadroxil uptake. Current-voltage relationships in the presence of glycylsarcosine or cefadroxil showed that transport activity is dependent on the membrane potential. Sequencing of the cDNA revealed its identity with the recently cloned peptide transporter from rabbit small intestine designated PepT1.", 
    "66": "SHORT- VERSUS LONG-ACTING ANGIOTENSIN CONVERTING ENZYME (ACE) INHIBITORS: Although ACE inhibitors are widely used in the treatment of hypertension, there are few data on trough:peak ratios and the data are contradictory. Part of the explanation for this lies in differences in pharmacological properties. Depending on the kinetics of elimination, the trough:peak ratio of short- and long-acting ACE inhibitors has to be evaluated according to a dose regimen of twice or once a day, respectively, and must take account of the dose used, since long-acting ACE inhibitors appear to have a dose-dependent trough:peak effect. Further explanations for the contradictory trough:peak ratios reported for ACE inhibitors include measurement methods (clinic blood pressure versus ambulatory monitoring) and study design. TROUGH:PEAK RATIO: Data from randomly allocated, placebo-controlled studies indicate that both the short-acting ACE inhibitors captopril and quinapril given twice a day and the long-acting ACE inhibitors enalapril, lisinopril, benazepril and cilazapril given once a day have an acceptable trough:peak ratio (> 50%).

Similarly, there is a decrease after the administration of clonidine. Guanfacine, however, which acts on the same central receptors, does not lessen variability. Calcium antagonists do not influence blood pressure variability and the results with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are contradictory.", 
    "70": "From these results we conclude that blood pressure variability is not dependent on beta-receptor activity or calcium-mediated mechanisms. It is most likely that both alpha-adrenergic tone and the vagal system have significant effects on blood pressure variability.", 
    "71": "In this study, which was primarily designed to determine the lipid-lowering efficacy of pravastatin in the setting of background antihypertensive therapy with ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists, we took the opportunity to examine whether pravastatin interacts with antihypertensive therapy to produce additional falls in blood pressure. This may help clarify the mechanism of action of pravastatin's rapid beneficial effects on cardiovascular morbidity. We treated 25 hypertensive hypercholesterolaemic patients with 12 weeks of either pravastatin or placebo in this double blind, placebo controlled parallel group study. Placebo treatment did not alter plasma lipids, whereas 12 weeks' treatment with pravastatin reduced total cholesterol by 27% (from 7.1 +/- 0.27 to 5.2 +/- 0.18, p < 0.001 compared with placebo) and low density lipoprotein cholesterol by 35% (from 4.9 +/- 0.36 to 3.2 +/- 0.17, p < 0.001). There were no changes in systolic or diastolic blood pressure either following 12 weeks' treatment or 3 weeks' withdrawal of pravastatin. Thus, pravastatin remains efficacious as a lipid lowering agent in the presence of antihypertensive therapy but does not enhance the blood pressure lowering action of these drugs. Therefore it is unlikely that blood pressure reduction is the mechanism by which pravastatin mediates its reported short term effects on cardiovascular morbidity.", 
    "72": "Immunoreactive endothelin (ir-ET) was measured in peripheral venous plasma in 12 patients with renovascular hypertension (RVH) due to unilateral renal arterial stenosis, in 12 patients with essential hypertension (EH), and in 12 control subjects (C). In the patients with RVH, ir-ET was also measured in the aorta and in both renal veins before and 1 h after 25 mg of captopril was given orally. In peripheral venous plasma, ir-ET was the same in RVH (median 1.02 pmol/l (range 0.53-1.65)) as in EH (0.96 pmol/l (0.76-1.32)) and in C (1.00 pmol/l (0.77-1.16)). In RVH, the concentrations of ir-ET decrease from the aorta to the renal vein of both the affected (0.88 pmol/l (0.54-1.28) vs 0.68 (0.51-1.24), p < 0.01) and in the unaffected kidney (0.85 pmol/l (0.62-1.38) vs 0.78 pmol/l (0.36-1.25), p < 0.01). Renal extraction of ir-ET was the same on the affected side (15.1% (-3.7-33.2)) and on the unaffected side (11.2% (0.5-46.4)). In the aorta, ir-ET was significantly lower than in peripheral venous plasma (p < 0.05). The renal handling of ir-ET did not change in response to captopril in either the affected or unaffected kidney. It is concluded that circulating levels of ir-ET are normal in renovascular hypertension associated with unilateral renal artery stenosis and in essential hypertension. There is significant renal extraction of ir-ET which is unaffected by renal artery stenosis and captopril.", 
    "73": "Semotiadil fumarate, a novel benzothiazine calcium antagonist, was given alone or in combination with either enalapril or trichlormethiazide to conscious, spontaneously hypertensive, rats daily for 2 weeks. Systolic blood pressure and heart rate were recorded 24 h before the start of the regimen and then every 2 and 24 h after the 1st, 3rd, 7th, 10th and 14th doses. When given alone, the antihypertensive effects of semotiadil (10 mg/kg, p.o.) and enalapril (5 mg/kg, p.o.) first became apparent after the 3rd dose and thereafter the effects appeared to develop daily although this effect had waned by the time of the next dose. When given in combination, however, these drugs appeared to potentiate each other and after the 7th dose, the antihypertensive effect persisted. Trichlormethiazide (30 mg/kg, p.o.) alone failed to exert any significant antihypertensive effect and in combination was not always additive to that of semotiadil. In contrast to the effect on blood pressure, the heart rate remained resistant to all these drugs. These results indicate that combined daily dosing of semotiadil, especially with enalapril, each at relatively low doses may be able to control hypertension in a continuous manner.", 
    "74": "This study assessed the effects of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, perindopril, on the 24-hour blood pressure (BP) profile and hemodynamic responses to isometric exercise and mental stress in elderly hypertensive patients. We performed ambulatory BP monitorings and echocardiographic studies during hand-grip exercises and a mental stress test before and after the 10-week administration of perindopril in 11 elderly patients (mean age, 71.8 years). Office BP was significantly decreased by perindopril treatment. Both daytime and nighttime systolic BP decreased significantly without any change in circadian pattern (P < 0.05). Daytime diastolic BP was also significantly decreased by perindopril (P < 0.05); nighttime diastolic pressure was decreased, but this result was not statistically significant. The reduction in 24-hour BP was associated with a decreased left ventricular end-systolic dimension (P < 0.01) and an increased fractional shortening (P < 0.01), suggesting reduced afterload due to arterial dilatation. The left ventricular mass index was not changed by perindopril therapy, and neither were systolic and diastolic BP responses to the handgrip exercises. The increases in systolic BP during mental stress was augmented after perindopril therapy, although systolic BP during mental stress after treatment was significantly lower than before treatment (P < 0.05). These results indicate that perindopril is effective in reducing ambulatory 24-hour BP levels and is associated with improved systolic function caused by dilatation of resistance vessels.", 
    "75": "A combination of benazepril 10 mg plus hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg once daily was investigated in the treatment of patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension who had not responded to monotherapy with benazepril 10 mg. Patients failing to respond to 4 weeks of benazepril 10 mg/d were randomized to continue with the monotherapy (n = 47) or receive the combination therapy (n = 46). After 4 weeks of double-blind treatment, reductions in blood pressure were significantly greater among patients given the combination than among those receiving benazepril alone: a 4.7 +/- 1.5 mm Hg difference in mean sitting diastolic blood pressure was noted in favor of the combination therapy (P = 0.0037). The incidence of adverse events, particularly cough, was lower with benazepril + hydrochlorothiazide than with benazepril alone; no notable changes in body weight or heart rate were seen in either group.",

At the stress test there was an increase of exercise time from 9 to 17 minutes and from 12 to 16 minutes with captopril and ibopamine respectively. The Echo study showed respectively to captopril and ibopamine groups a left ventricular and diastolic diameter increase from 72 to 74 and from 74 to 75mm and a increase from 0.35 to 0.38 and from 0.35 to 0.39 of the left ventricular ejection fraction. The incidence of ventricular arrhythmias was similar in both groups.",

    "80": "The respective effects of 6 month's administration of beta-blockers (atenolol, metoprolol, carteolol and arotinolol), calcium-channel blockers (nicardipine, diltiazem) and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril) on hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels were evaluated in hypertensive patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), using a retrospective method. NIDDM patients with stable HbA1c and body weight were selected for this study. The following results were obtained. (1) The administration of nicardipine or beta-blockers significantly elevated HbA1c levels. (2) The administration of diltiazem or enalapril did not have any influence on HbA1c levels. These findings suggest that not only beta-blocker but nicardipine (dihydropyridine type calcium-channel blocker) may cause deterioration in glucose metabolism in NIDDM patients.", 
    "81": "We have tested the hypothesis that altered vascular reactivity, specifically the appearance of spontaneous and BayK 8644 (L-type voltage gated calcium channel agonist)-induced oscillations in the carotid artery and the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibitor cyclopiazonic acid (CPA)-induced oscillations in the aorta from stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRS), are dependent upon angiotensin II production early in life. SHRSP and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats were treated from 6-10 weeks of age with vehicle, hydralazine/hydrochlorothiazide (used as a control for lowered blood pressure) or the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril (3 mg/kg/day). Systolic blood pressures were measured weekly in rats from 6 to 17 weeks of age. In SHRSP (at 17 weeks of age), ramipril-treatment but not hydralazine/hydrochlorothiazide attenuated the long term expression of elevated systolic blood pressure in adult SHRSP while blood pressures of all adult WKY rats were unaffected by any treatment. At 17 weeks, rats were killed and arteries removed for in vitro measurement of isometric contractile activity. Only the incidence of spontaneous oscillations (carotid artery) was affected by ramipril treatment; ramipril did not change the frequency of BayK 8644-induced oscillations in the artery or the frequency of CPA-induced oscillations in aorta from either SHRSP or WKY. These data indicate that while spontaneous oscillations in the carotid artery may be dependent on an angiotensin II-sensitive mechanism during development, agonist-induced oscillations (CPA and BayK 8644) appear not to be angiotensin II-dependent. Thus, not all of the contractile oscillations which appear in vascular smooth muscle from SHRSP are angiotensin II-dependent, suggesting that some of these vascular abnormalities may develop at a time separate from that in which increased blood pressure is firmly established and may not be associated with the for maintenance of elevated blood pressure.", 
    "82": "Endothelin-1 (ET-1) and angiotensin II (AII) are potent vasoconstrictor hormones which regulate tissue perfusion and blood pressure. We pharmacologically characterized endothelin and angiotensin receptors mediating contractions of human mammary resistance arteries in myographs for isometric tension recording. ET-1 caused potent contractions. The concentration response curve was shifted to the right by ETA antagonist FR 139317, but a high sensitivity, low efficacy component remained. After incubation with ETB agonist sarafotoxin (S6c) this component of the concentration response curve resistant to FR 139317 disappeared. The ETA/ETB-receptor antagonist bosentan shifted the entire concentration response curve to the right. AI and AII caused marked contractions. The effects of AI were reduced by the ACE inhibitor benazeprilat, while those of AII were prevented by valsartan, an AT1 antagonist. In summary, in human resistance arteries, contractions to ET-1 are mediated by ETA- and ETB-receptors while those to AII are exclusively mediated by AT1-receptors.", 
    "83": "Synthesis of angiotensin-converting enzyme is induced during its chronic inhibition. Like angiotensin-converting enzyme, neutral endopeptidase (EC 3.4.24.11) is a plasma membrane peptidase. We studied changes of the two enzymes in lung, kidney and serum in a coronary ligation model of experimental congestive heart failure, and during chronic inhibition of the enzymes. Coronary-ligated rats (n = 19) and sham-operated controls (n = 18) were given SCH 34826 [(S)-N-[N-[1-[[(2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl) methoxy]carbonyl]-2-phenylethyl]-L-phenylalanine]-beta-alanine], a specific neutral endopeptidase inhibitor (n = 13), captopril (n = 12), or vehicle (n = 12) for 4 days, and exsanguinated. Pulmonary angiotensin-converting enzyme was induced both by captopril (52% compared to vehicle) and by SCH 34826 (21%). Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme was induced by captopril (44%). Neutral endopeptidase was induced in lung by captopril (73%), and in kidney by SCH 38426 (32%). Compared to controls, the relative heart weight of rats with heart failure was increased by 29%, and the plasma level of atrial natriuretic peptide elevated by 74%, but enzyme activities were not different. We conclude that, in the rat, separate inhibition of either angiotensin-converting enzyme or neutral endopeptidase induces both enzymes, and that the induction varies in different tissues. Alterations in the substrates of the two enzymes, e.g. in bradykinin, might cause these changes.",

In the five hypertensive cases with an increased Tmax, selective angiography demonstrated severe stenotic and tortuous changes in the small intrarenal branches of the high-dose irradiated kidneys without stenosis of the main renal artery.

We have recently shown an authentic Ang II/Ang I ratio of 1.5:1 in renal lymph, the opposite of the Ang II:Ang I relation in plasma. Our second goal was to examine the influence of maximal angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition on these relations in plasma and in renal tissue. We used two converting enzyme inhibitors with differing lipid solubility, on the premise that tissue penetration and action might differ on that basis. We measured Ang I and Ang II in plasma and renal tissue of rats given an intravenous dose of either vehicle, enalapril, or ramipril, over a wide dose range, from 0.1 to 10.0 mg/kg i.v. Renal and plasma angiotensin concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography and radioimmunoassay. Whereas the Ang I concentration in normal rat plasma (273 +/- 84 fmol/mL) was over threefold the plasma Ang II concentration (83 +/- 12 fmol/mL), the ratio was reversed in the kidney (Ang II, 178 +/- 12 versus Ang I, 91 +/- 3 fmol/g; P < .001).

The objective of this study was to determine whether long-term treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors improves endothelium-dependent vasodilation in forearm resistance vessels of patients with hypertension.

In hypertension, color-Doppler US can be used to study the renal arteries for both the diagnosis of renovascular hypertension and better physiopathologic assessment of renal arterial blood flow in essential hypertension. To this purpose, we studied renal flow characteristics with the resistive index in both basal conditions and after pharmacologic stimulation with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. The resistive index was seen to rise in parallel with hypertension severity, as measured by mean arterial pressure; the change was statistically significant (p < 0.05). Values rose step by step from 57.4 (+/- 4.96) in the right renal artery and from 56.6 (+/- 4.18) in the left one in controls, up to 62.2 (+/- 6.6) in the right and 62.3 (+/- 7) in the left renal arteries of severe hypertensives.

At the end of the study all adriamycin-treated groups had the same degree of renal failure irrespective of whether blood pressure was well controlled with captopril or hydralazine or whether hypertension persisted. Nevertheless, antihypertensive therapy slowed down renal function deterioration in the early stage of adriamycin nephropathy.

We have investigated this issue using transient occlusion of the inferior vena cava to simulate hypotensive hemorrhage. Single-unit recording experiments done in the supraoptic nucleus of pentobarbital-anesthetized rats demonstrated that severe caval occlusion, sufficient to drop mean arterial pressure (MAP) below 30 mmHg, excited 88% of putative VP neurosecretory cells and a similar proportion of putative oxytocin (OT) cells. Responsive VP cells increased their firing by 8.5 +/- 0.6 spikes/s within 11.2 +/- 0.8 s of the fall in MAP. This response was unrelated to the size of the fall in MAP and was unchanged by combined sinoaortic denervation (SAD) and vagal denervation, by T1 spinal section, or by administration of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril, except that spinal section decreased the response latency. Moderate caval occlusion, sufficient to drop MAP to approximately 50 mmHg, did not excite any of the OT cells tested but did excite 65% of VP cells, causing a 3.8 +/- 0.3 spikes/s increase in firing after a delay of 9.0 +/- 1.3 s. This response was proportional to the size of the preceding fall in MAP, and after combined SAD and vagal denervation only 20% of VP cells still responded. Elimination of sinoaortic or vagal afferents alone had no effect on VP cell responses to moderate caval occlusion, except that SAD significantly increased the response latency. These data suggest that in rat the mechanisms that initiate the VP response to hypotensive hemorrhage depend on stimulus intensity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Changes in sympathovagal balance modulating the sinoatrial (SA) node were inferred, respectively, from the low (LFR-R)- and high-frequency (HFR-R) components of R-R variability; LFSAP furnished a marker of sympathetic vasomotor control. Increases in sympathetic activity were induced by three different experimental maneuvers [bilateral carotid occlusion (BCO), coronary artery occlusion (CAO), and dynamic exercise] capable of increasing sympathetic outflow to the SA node and to the vessels. Studies were performed both before and after intravenous captopril administration. During BCO, only LFSAP increased from 4.3 +/- 1.5 to 19.7 +/- 4.1 mmHg2; during CAO, both LFR-R and LFSAP increased, respectively, from 3 +/- 1 to 21 +/- 2 normalized units (nu) and from 4.1 +/- 1.3 to 7.2 +/- 1.5 mmHg2. Dynamic exercise at 2 and 4 km/h progressively raised LFR-R from 8 +/- 2 to 58 +/- 7 and 75 +/- 5 nu, respectively; LFSAP showed a parallel trend increasing from 2.5 +/- 0.7 to 8.04 +/- 1.9 and 12.7 +/- 2.2 mmHg2. In all experimental conditions, captopril significantly (P < 0.05) blunted the increase of LFSAP. A restraining effect on LFR-R was apparent only with CAO.

Factors that contribute to this variability include a lack of consistency in diagnostic criteria, the preparation of the patient and the performance of the test, and the criterion standard (renal artery stenosis or renovascular hypertension). We investigated the sensitivity and specificity of a simplified version of the test, based on a single postcaptopril value of plasma renin activity, in 36 patients who were undergoing either angioplasty or surgery for renal artery stenosis. The test demonstrated an excellent sensitivity (96%) but a poor specificity (55%). However, the poor specificity was related to certain clinical characteristics; high baseline plasma renin activity measurements, female gender, current smoking, renal dysfunction, and bilateral renal artery stenosis were all associated with false-positive results. This simplified captopril test, when applied to a population with a high prevalence of renovascular hypertension and performed in a standardized manner, can accurately identify those patients unlikely to respond to intervention. However, a positive test, especially in those with the characteristics noted above, does not help clinical decision making because of the limited test specificity.",

The prevalence and natural history of this disease remain unknown due to difficulty in identification of the process. There are several scenarios that may help alert the clinician to the presence of atherosclerotic renovascular disease. In hypertensive patients, poorly controlled blood pressure on several medications or rapid acceleration of hypertension can suggest renovascular disease. In addition, high-grade retinopathy or abdominal bruits seem to be associated with this condition: bruits have the highest positive predictive value of the clinical signs. Renal artery stenosis also may be related to rapidly progressive renal failure. The classic association is renal failure after use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors; however, acute renal failure induced through any sudden therapeutic decrease in blood pressure may imply the presence of renal artery stenosis. Unexplained azotemia in the elderly patient also has been associated with renovascular disease. It is possible that the majority of patients with renal artery stenosis are those with a clinically silent process. Advanced age, peripheral atherosclerotic vascular disease, and coronary artery disease may all have a high association with stenosis of one or both renal arteries. It is nevertheless unknown whether a radiographically detected lesion implies current or future clinical complications.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The causes of the increase in ESRD are not known. Although control of any degree of hypertension with any antihypertensive drug will slow the progression of renal failure from any cause, captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, has been shown to slow progressive renal failure in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus to a greater degree than that expected from only its antihypertensive effect.

Control or streptozocin-induced diabetic rats were randomized to receive no drug or the ACE inhibitor perindopril. In addition, other diabetic rats were randomized to receive either low-dose insulin that does not alter glycemic control or high-dose insulin, administered as a silastic pellet to achieve euglycemia.

Diabetes was associated with increased mesenteric ACE levels, increased vessel weight, and an increase in the wall:lumen ratio. ACE inhibition, despite no effect on glycemic control, food intake, urinary urea excretion, or gut weight, prevented the increase in mesenteric ACE levels and attenuated mesenteric vascular hypertrophy as assessed by weight or wall:lumen ratio. The increase in staining by an antibody to the endothelial product, von Willebrand factor, in diabetic rats was totally prevented by perindopril treatment. Euglycemia but not low-dose insulin therapy in the diabetic rats normalized mesenteric vessel ACE, weight, and wall:lumen ratio.

Cardiac volume overload by aortocaval shunt or minoxidil treatment decreased LV collagen accumulation as compared with control rats. In contrast, RV collagen accumulation was potentiated during the initial weeks but not during chronic aortocaval shunt. Enalapril and losartan prevented the relative decreases in LV collagen content and concentration induced by a shunt. Losartan also reversed the decrease in LV collagen content by aortocaval shunt. Neither blocker significantly affected the enhanced RV collagen accumulation during the initial weeks of shunt, but both blockers further potentiated RV collagen accumulation during chronic volume overload. Aortocaval shunt for 4 weeks but not 10 weeks enhanced LV and RV elastin accumulation. This initial increase in LV and RV elastin content was blocked by both enalapril and losartan.", 
    "151": "Cardiac volume overload, even when accompanied by increased plasma renin activity, decreases LV collagen accumulation, suggesting that in contrast to the stimulatory effect of systolic wall stress, increased diastolic wall stress inhibits collagen accumulation. In support of this concept, enalapril and losartan decreased LV preload and maintained LV collagen accumulation. In contrast to LV collagen, RV collagen accumulation was potentiated during the initial weeks of volume overload, possibly related to acute RV pressure overload shortly after aortocaval shunt and its decrease with chronic shunt. Enalapril and losartan had minimal effect on the enhanced RV collagen during the initial weeks of aortocaval shunt but potentiated RV collagen during chronic shunt, possibly by decreasing RV diastolic pressures. Altogether, these data suggest that during cardiac volume overload, the RAS affects cardiac collagen primarily by its hemodynamic effects. The RAS, however, may potentiate RV and LV elastin accumulation during the initial weeks of volume overload since both enalapril and losartan block this increase.",

The influence of captopril on recurrent MI, cardiac revascularization procedures, and hospitalization with unstable angina was examined. The likelihood of recurrent MI was greater in patients with an MI or functional disability before the index infarction and higher systolic pressure (all P < .001) but was not influenced by baseline left ventricular ejection fraction. Therapy with captopril reduced the risk of development of recurrent MI by 25% (95% confidence intervals, 5% to 40%; P = .015) and the risk of death after recurrent MI by 32% (95% confidence intervals, 4% to 51%; P = .029).

Atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) dilates preglomerular resistance vessels, in which autoregulation occurs, and has been reported to inhibit TGF. This study addressed potential actions of ANF on the slow, TGF-mediated, component of autoregulation. Renal blood flow was measured by an electromagnetic flow probe in Sprague-Dawley rats anesthetized by halothane or isoflurane while renal perfusion pressure was manipulated by a servo-controlled clamp placed on the aorta between the renal arteries. Progressive reduction of perfusion pressure to 60 mmHg (1 mmHg = 133.3 Pa) induced resetting of autoregulation to operate at the reduced pressure and to defend lower renal blood flow. Infusion of ANF at a dose shown to reliably increase sodium excretion did not affect autoregulation or its resetting. Because resetting is angiotensin II dependent, the converting enzyme inhibitor Enalaprilat was used to provide angiotensin II blockade. As expected, autoregulation did not reset to operate at reduced perfusion pressure. Again ANF was without effect. In a third experiment, relaxation of resistance was assessed in response to repeated steps of perfusion pressure between 65 and 75 mmHg. Time constants of constriction and dilatation were recovered by fitting to a single exponential before and during ANF infusion. Time constants ranged form 0.045 to 0.055 Hz, were consistent with operation of TGF, were not different for constriction or dilatation, and were unaltered by ANF; nor did ANF affect the magnitude of constriction or dilatation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "160": "Clinical evidence accumulated over the past decade suggests that neurohormonal mechanisms significantly influence the pathogenesis and eventual outcome of congestive heart failure (CHF). Pharmacologic modulation of this neuroendocrine activity can, consequently, be expected to improve patient prognosis. Results of several recent clinical trials--the Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD), the second Veterans Administration Cooperative Vasodilator Heart Failure Trial (VH eFT-II), and the Cooperative North Scandinavian Enalapril Survival Study (CONSENSUS)--provide substantial evidence that addition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril to conventional therapeutic regimens can significantly reduce mortality and improve prognosis in patients with all grades of heart failure. Moreover, data from all three trials confirm the involvement of neurohormonal systems in the development and progression of CHF and suggest that the beneficial effects of enalapril in heart failure may in part be due to the suppression of this neurohormonal activity. It is now apparent that some form of neurohormonal activation is present early in the course of the disease before the emergence of overt heart failure symptoms. On the basis of such findings, it would seem that early introduction of therapy targeted at neurohormonal influences may well become a central component of any future CHF treatment program.",

To confirm these findings, a histopathological investigation was conducted on the kidney of salt-loaded (from 11 to 16 weeks of age) SHRSP, which was the subject of the preceding study. Their brains and hearts were also examined. Histopathologically, renal lesions such as fibrinoid necrosis and proliferative arteritis of small calibration arteries, necrotizing glomerulitis and tubular degeneration, and cerebral hemorrhage and slight cardial hypertrophy were observed in salt-loaded control SHRSP. The occurrence of these lesions were prevented in a dose-dependent manner by the administration of imidapril (1 and 2 mg/kg/day). Especially, the preventive effects on the renal lesions were apparently noted. Enalapril also prevented these renal lesions, but its preventive effects were weaker than those of imidapril at the same dose (2 mg/kg/day).

Compared with baseline, 1 week of placebo reduced the sum of ST-segment depression, the main efficacy parameter, by 10% (NS), captopril by 19% (NS), ISDN by 37% (P < 0.001) and the combination of captopril and ISDN by 42% (P < 0.001; NS versus ISDN). No patient remained completely free of exercise-induced angina during treatment with captopril; however, three patients after ISDN and seven patients after the combination did (P < 0.05). Blood pressure at rest decreased at peak effect by 9-10% systolic (P < 0.001) with monotherapy and by up to 7% diastolic (P < 0.001), and during combined therapy with captopril and ISDN by 18% systolic (P < 0.001) and 12% diastolic (P < 0.001). Significantly enhanced circulatory effects of captopril plus ISDN versus ISDN were found for blood pressure (P < 0.001) and peripheral arterial vasodilation (P < 0.01). The reflex tachycardia induced by ISDN in the upright position (5 beats/min) was not blocked by captopril during combined therapy.", 
    "165": "The antianginal and anti-ischemic effects of captopril alone were marginal, despite significant circulatory effects after short-term administration. Although captopril in combination with ISDN resulted in a significant further blood-pressure-lowering effect and increased peripheral arterial vasodilatation, the magnitude of potentiation of the anti-ischemic nitrate effects was, in contrast, small. Only exercise-induced angina was further improved by the use of the combination. No paradoxical worsening of ischemia or angina was seen after captopril. Thus, although captopril has no place as first-line therapy for ischemia, its use in combination with ISDN could be advantageous for long-term prognosis.", 
    "166": "We tested the hypothesis that overactivity of the renal and systemic renin-angiotensin system is important to the pathogenesis of hypertension in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Up to 21 normotensive subjects with ADPKD and creatinine clearance > 70 ml/min/1.73 m2 were compared to 12 unaffected controls from the same families. Blood pressure, serum chemistry, sodium excretion, plasma renin and serum aldosterone and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) levels were measured at baseline, after acute sodium depletion, and after chronic higher sodium intake with and without enalapril. Effective renal plasma flow was measured by paraaminohippurate clearance in the higher sodium state, before and during an intravenous infusion of angiotensin II at 3 ng/kg/min. This was to test whether, by analogy to non-modulating essential hypertension, renal blood flow would fall to a lesser extent in the ADPKD subjects. The groups were comparable at baseline apart from a higher supine mean arterial pressure in the ADPKD group (median 91 vs. 81 mm Hg, P = 0.002). There were no significant differences between ADPKD and control subjects in blood pressure or hormonal response to sodium depletion. During chronically higher sodium intake, serum ANP was significantly higher (median 130 vs. 81 ng/liter, P = 0.0006) and plasma renin tended to be higher (median 20.5 vs. 13.5, P = 0.08) in ADPKD than in control subjects. The ADPKD group had a higher renal vascular resistance (median 7420 vs. 5915 dyn.sec.cm-5, P = 0.009) before angiotensin, but tended to have a lower percentage rise in resistance during angiotensin (median 31.5 vs. 46, P = 0.14).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "167": "Although an underlying disturbance in cardiac function can be identified in most patients with congestive heart failure, manifestations of the disease are greatly influenced by other factors, particularly neurohumoral and peripheral adaptive responses which occur secondary to impaired cardiac function. Until recently diuretic agents and digoxin formed the basis of conventional treatment of this condition. The majority of clinical trials published since 1980, indicate that digoxin lessens symptoms and reduces morbidity associated with congestive heart failure particularly in patients with more advanced symptoms and ventricular dysfunction. The efficacy of digitalis in congestive heart failure may in part result from sympathoinhibitory properties such as the activation of baroreceptorial mechanisms. At present there is no conclusive evidence that cardiac glycosides improve survival. Several trials clearly indicate that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (enalapril, captopril) can reduce both morbidity and mortality in symptomatic congestive heart failure. Asymptomatic patients like those with severe left ventricular dysfunction and those who are at high risk for left ventricular remodeling after anterior wall myocardial infarction may also benefit from ACE-inhibition therapy. Increasing evidence suggests that beta-adrenergic blockade can produce symptomatic and hemodynamic improvement in heart failure of idiopathic and ischemic aetiology. Appropriately powered randomized controlled trials are required to determine the impact on survival of beta-blockers.", 
    "168": "Congestive heart failure is characterized by profound alterations in systemic haemodynamics as well as in neurohumoral profile with activation of the sympathetic nervous system, reninangiotensin axis, plasma vasopressin and atrial natriuretic peptides, i.e. factors involved in homeostatic control of the cardiovascular system. The sympathetic stimulation, which has been documented by a variety of methodological approaches (plasma norepinephrine measurement, norepinephrine spillover technique, microneurographic recording of efferent post-ganglionic muscle sympathetic nerve traffic) is already evident in the initial stages of the disease (NYHA classes I-II) and more manifest in severe heart failure (NYHA classes III-IV). Although representing in mild heart failure a compensatory mechanism aimed at preserving cardiac output, the sympathetic and neurohumoral activation, which can be likely ascribed to arterial baroreceptor dysfunction, may represent, in the clinical course of the disease, a maladaptative phenomenon. Thus pharmacological treatment of heart failure should be aimed not only at improving systemic haemodynamics but also at reversing neurohumoral activation and baroreflex impairment. Recent experimental clinical evidence suggests that these therapeutical goals can be satisfactorily achieved by digitalis glycosides and ACE-inhibitors.", 
    "169": "Heart failure is today one of the most serious health problems of modern industrialized societies. The increase in the mean age of the population is an additional factor which favours a high incidence of episodes of heart failure. Age is also a relevant factor in mortality linked with heart failure. On this basis more emphasis has been given by researchers and physicians to improve a preventive and therapeutic approach to heart failure. For many years the pharmacological treatment of heart failure patients was based on the increase in inotropism through the digitalis and on the reduction in sodium-water retention through diuretics, while less importance was given to the improvement of the afterload. We have had knowledge of vasodilatory drugs in chronic heart failure for at least 20 years but only 10 years ago with the Vasodilator-Heart Failure Trial (V-HeFTI), it was proved that the combination of hydralazine and nitrates in addition to the conventional treatment, improved the survival of patients affected by moderate-severe heart failure. With the advent of the ACE-inhibitors, in the '80s, the first studies concerning the role of such drugs in heart failure were carried out. In the Cooperative North Scandinavian Enalapril Survival Study (CONSENSUS I) it was proved for the first time that an ACE-inhibitor (enalapril), added to the conventional heart failure therapy, improved the survival of patients with severe congestive heart failure (NYHA class IV). The result was so extraordinary that the study was interrupted for ethical reasons. However, it has raised a considerable interest in the study of the ACE-inhibitors in heart failure and now it has been proved that such drugs are a milestone in a correct pharmacological approach to heart failure.",

It compares tight blood pressure control (aim: < 150/85 mmHg) versus less tight control (aim: < 180/105 mmHg) and, within the tight control group, an ACE inhibitor, captopril, versus a beta blocker, atenolol. We report the efficacy, side-effects of treatment, biochemical responses and incidence of hypoglycaemia in 755 patients (mean age 57 years, blood pressure 150/94 mmHg) followed for 2 years. At 2 years, blood pressure was 143/84 in the tight control and 156/90 mmHg in the less tight control group (p < 0.0001). Blood pressure reduction, adherence to therapy, incidence of side-effects and of hypoglycaemia were similar on captopril and on atenolol. Patients on atenolol had a greater increase in body weight (+2.3 vs +0.7 kg, p < 0.01) and a non-significant trend to a greater increase in triglyceride than patients on captopril. A large blood pressure difference between the tight control and less tight control groups was obtained, with captopril and atenolol having similar hypotensive effects. The study has the potential to determine whether strict blood pressure control reduces the incidence of diabetic complications and whether ACE inhibitor or beta-blocker therapy is clinically advantageous.",

The latter were monitored until urinary protein excretion reached 40 to 50 mg/24 h (on average, 23 wk after the induction of the diabetes). At this time, Group 2 continued to receive insulin alone, whereas Group 3 was also given the ACE inhibitor moexipril for 8 more wk. Untreated diabetic rats showed a moderate increase in systolic blood pressure that was normalized by moexipril administration. Urinary protein excretion progressively increased during the 8-wk follow-up in untreated diabetics that, at the end of the study, developed moderate glomerular sclerosis. Moexipril treatment lowered urinary protein excretion to a normal range and completely prevented glomerular injury. Three other groups of rats were similarly treated, except that moexipril treatment was started later on (when proteinuria reached 100 to 200 mg/24 h, on average, 32 wk after the induction of diabetes), and were monitored for another 8 wk.

    "173": "The present study was designed to examine some of the pharmacological properties of venom from the stonefish (Synanceja trachynis), with particular reference to the presence in the venom of pain-producing/enhancing substances. Stonefish venom (1-6 micrograms/ml) produced concentration-dependent contractile responses in guinea-pig isolated ileum. No tachyphylaxis, or reduction in responses with time, was observed to venom (3 micrograms/ml) in ileum. The response to venom (3 micrograms/ml) was not significantly affected by the histamine antagonist mepyramine (0.5 microM), or a preceding anaphylactic response. Mecamylamine, 5HT-desensitization or EXP3174 failed to have any significant effect on responses to venom (3 micrograms/ml). Responses to venom (3 micrograms/ml) were significantly inhibited by the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin (5 microM), the leukotriene D4 receptor antagonist FLP55712 (1 microM), the thromboxane A2 receptor antagonist GR32191B (1 microM), the muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine (10 nM) and the neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist CP96345 (0.1 microM). Venom (6 micrograms/ml) produced contractile responses in the rat isolated vas deferens which were abolished by the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin (0.3 microM) and significantly potentiated by the neuronal uptake inhibitor DMI (1 microM). However, noradrenergic transmitter depletion with reserpine (5 mg/kg, i.p.) did not significantly inhibit responses to venom (6 micrograms/ml). Histamine fluorometric and phospholipase A2 assays failed to detect significant quantities of either substance in the venom. These results suggest that stonefish venom may cause the release of acetylcholine, substance P, and cyclooxygenase products, or contain components which act at these receptors. The venom also appears to contain a component which is a substrate for neuronal uptake and has a direct action at alpha 1-adrenoceptors.", 
    "174": "Recent studies have shown that, not only in hypertensive animals but even in normotensive rats, dietary salt (sodium chloride) produces a dose-related increase in the left ventricular and renal mass. In the present study the effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) enalapril and the thiazide-type diuretic, hydrochlorothiazide, on the development of the salt-induced left ventricular and kidney hypertrophy were examined in normotensive Wistar-Kyoto and Wistar rats. A high intake of sodium chloride (6% of the dry weight of the chow to mimic the level found in many human food items) during eight weeks produced a marked increase in the mass of the left ventricle and the kidneys in both rat strains with little or no effect on blood pressure. The cardiac hypertrophy correlated strongly with the renal hypertrophy. These salt-induced changes in the heart and in the kidneys were completely blocked by hydrochlorothiazide, while enalapril was devoid of any significant effects during the high-salt diet. However, during a low-salt diet enalapril, but not hydrochlorothiazide, effectively lowered the blood pressure and decreased the left ventricular mass of the normotensive rats. There was a 3- to 4-fold increase in the urinary excretion of calcium during the high intake of sodium chloride. Hydrochlorothiazide decreased the urinary excretion of calcium even during the low salt diet, and it completely blocked the salt-induced hypercalciuria. Enalapril had no significant effect on the urinary calcium excretion. During the low-salt diet hydrochlorothiazide increased the calcium and decreased the potassium concentration in the heart while enalapril increased the phosphorus concentration. In conclusion, a high intake of sodium chloride produced hypertrophy both in the heart and in the kidneys, even in the absence of a rise in blood pressure. Salt also remarkably increased the urinary calcium excretion. These harmful effects of salt were blocked by the thiazide diuretic hydrochlorothiazide but not by the ACEI enalapril. However, this study does not allow to make any direct comparison between the effects of enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide.",

From the analysis of efficacy one patient from the lisinopril and two patients from the nifedipine groups were excluded because their supine DBP after run-in was < 95 mmHg. Adverse reactions, mostly transient during the initial treatment period, and withdrawals occurred in six (4.1%) and three (2.1%) patients of the lisinopril group and in 12 (8.2%; NS) and three (2.0%) patients of the nifedipine group, respectively. After the six weeks' treatment period the lisinopril group showed 19 nonresponders (supine DBP > or = 95 mmHg) of the remaining 142 patients and the nifedipine group revealed 20 nonresponders of the remaining 142 patients. Initial supine and standing heart rates were similar in both groups. Supine heart rate fell significantly in the lisinopril group, whereas standing heart rate in this group and supine and standing heart rates in the nifedipine group did not change significantly with treatment.

Saline infusion alone during LoSo increased natriuresis without changes in catechol excretion or suppression of plasma renin activity (PRA) or plasma aldosterone (PALD). Sympatho-inhibition by clonidine resulted in marked antinatriuresis, decrease in BP and decrease in UDOPAV and UDAV, whereas plasma DOPA, GFR, and ERPF remained unchanged. PRA and PALD rose as indication of activation of the RAA system, probably by the reduced renal perfusion pressure after clonidine. Captopril significantly stimulated the saline-induced natriuresis without affecting UDOPAV and UDAV. On HiSo, when sympathetic tone is relatively suppressed, saline infusion alone stimulated natriuresis but did not affect catechol excretion or PRA. In the first and second hour after saline infusion PALD was suppressed. Clonidine again reduced BP and natriuresis, while PRA, PALD, and UDOPAV and UDAV were unaffected.

Plasma concentrations of icatibant fell exponentially following each of three doses, up to the final measurement. Elimination half-lives calculated from linear regression of the mean data were 25, 27 and 29 min after 20, 50 and 100 micrograms kg-1 doses respectively. 4. Icatibant inhibited the effect of bradykinin (P < 0.001 at each dose of icatibant) in a dose-dependent manner. Bradykinin (100 ng min-1) increased mean blood flow in the infused arm by 238 +/- 31% when infused following placebo, by 112 +/- 21% after icatibant 20 micrograms kg-1, by 71 +/- 14% after icatibant 50 micrograms kg-1 and by 48 +/- 9% after icatibant 100 micrograms kg-1. 5. These results demonstrate that icatibant antagonises B2-receptor mediated vasodilation in human forearm resistance vessels. The findings provide a quantitative basis for future studies of the role of bradykinin in the response to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and in circulatory disease.", 
    "199": "A multicenter, open-label trial in Japan examined the efficacy, safety, and optimal dose of monatepil (AJ-2615) as monotherapy and in combination therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or beta-blockers. Patients with essential hypertension who had never been treated or had been refractory to conventional antihypertensive agents were enrolled in the trial. During a 4-week control period patients assigned to monotherapy received placebo and those assigned to combination therapy received an ACE inhibitor or beta-blocker and placebo. Patients with systolic blood pressure (BP) > or = 160 mm Hg and diastolic BP > or = 95 mm Hg at the end of the control period were enrolled in the study. The initial dose of monatepil was 30 mg/day in monotherapy and 15 mg/day in combination therapy; the daily dose was titrated to 60 mg/day according to the antihypertensive response. The treatment period was 8 to 12 weeks. Blood pressure decreased from 168 +/- 8/100 +/- 6 to 142 +/- 9/85 +/- 7 mm Hg (SD) with monatepil monotherapy, from 171 +/- 11/102 +/- 6 to 141 +/- 9/84 +/- 6 mm Hg in combination with ACE inhibitors, and from 175 +/- 13/102 +/- 7 to 153 +/- 21/91 +/- 9 mm Hg in combination with beta-blockers (P < .001). When patients in whom mean BP decreased by > or = 13 mm Hg were defined as responders, the response rate was 80.4%, 78.1%, and 51.6% in the respective groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "200": "Several classes of antihypertensive drugs, including beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium antagonists, alpha 1-blockers, and a combined calcium antagonist/alpha 1-blocker, have been shown to reduce atherosclerosis in hypercholesterolemic animals. Although the exact mechanism of action of these drugs has not been described, certain findings are of particular interest. All of these drugs have the ability to inhibit cellular growth. ACE inhibitors appear to be antiatherosclerotic in several species including the low density lipoprotein (LDL)-deficient Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic rabbit, and their effects appear to be mediated through both angiotensin II inhibition and bradykinin enhancement. Calcium antagonists may influence primarily the development of new atherosclerotic lesions and their action may be species specific and, at least in part, dependent on the integrity of the LDL receptor. The action of alpha 1-blockers and of a combined calcium antagonist/alpha 1-blocker in hypercholesterolemic animals is probably related in part to their cholesterol-lowering properties. Whether any of the antihypertensive drugs can affect atherosclerosis in humans remains to be determined. Clinical trials are in progress to examine their effects on the course of coronary heart disease and on surrogate endpoints of atherosclerosis such as those demonstrable by angiography and Doppler-ultrasound techniques. Although the results of trials involving such surrogate markers will be of great interest, the findings will need to be interpreted with caution because they may not necessarily be predictive of either the course of atherosclerosis or its clinical complications.", 
    "201": "The effect of the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor benazepril (55 mg/kg orally) on the preservation of cardiac performance in diabetic-hypertensive Dahl S rats was investigated. Diabetes mellitus was produced by streptozotocin. Fasting (4-h) blood glucose levels were 279 +/- 50 mg/dL in diabetic Dahl salt-sensitive v 79 +/- 5 mg/dL in nondiabetic Dahl salt-sensitive rats. Cardiac performance was determined at the end of 8 weeks in an isolated perfused working heart apparatus. Peak left ventricular pressure (LVPmax), left ventricular peak negative dP/dt, and coronary flow were depressed in diabetic Dahl S rats (P < or = .05 v control). These deficits in cardiac function were not observed in diabetic Dahl S rats chronically treated with benazepril. The beneficial effects of benazepril apparently were independent of systolic blood pressure reduction. Although plasma ACE activity was increased in diabetic Dahl S rats, plasma renin activity was reduced. This suggests that the beneficial effects of ACE inhibition may be due to an effect upon the kinin system rather than the renin-angiotensin system. The benazepril-associated preservation of cardiac function in this study suggests that ACE inhibitors may be beneficial in the treatment of diabetic heart disease.", 
    "202": "The treatment of hypertension must fall within a strategy of the early and strict control of blood pressure levels. Only actual normalisation of blood pressure can offer long term benefit regarding the incidence of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. While major studies undertaken up to now have already proven the benefit of treatment using classical drugs as monotherapy, it is now necessary to offer all young hypertension patients, even mild, with strict control of levels, a non-pharmacological action on risk factors, and a choice of treatments ensuring no loss of part of the prognostic benefit as a result of persistence or worsening or sub-clinical metabolic disorders. It seems logical, when first-line monotherapy is selected from among the five major drug groups recommended, is neither perfectly effective nor perfectly tolerated, and risks worsening a metabolic disorder in the long term, to use a combination of hypotensive drugs. This should enable blood pressure control in 80 to 90% of cases, and improved acceptability, a major factor in treatment compliance. It is reasonable to hope, in the long term, that the use of a combination of lower doses than as monotherapy, will ensure less interference with major metabolic, endocrine and vascular functions, leading to a further improvement in the prognosis of treated hypertension.", 
    "203": "A female neonate, born by cesarean section at 37 weeks of gestation, presented with respiratory distress syndrome, right pneumothorax and anuria. A sonogram showed increased echogenicity, with neither hydronephrosis nor macroscopic cysts. Peritoneal dialysis was started on the 14th day because of renal insufficiency, but the newborn died on the 33rd day. Family history was unremarkable, except that the mother received piroxicam at about the 26th week of gestation. A sonogram at the 28th week showed oligohydramnios. Histopathological study of the kidneys revealed crowded glomeruli and only few differentiated proximal convoluted tubules in the inner cortex, abnormally differentiated microcystic tubules and microcystic glomeruli in the outer cortex. Periodic acid-Schiff staining showed only traces of brush border in the dilated tubules of the outer cortex. Immunoperoxidase staining for epithelial membrane antigen was positive in the luminal border of all tubules. Electron microscopy confirmed the presence of brush border remnants and other proximal tubular characteristics in some segments. The renal abnormality bears some similarities to that found in familiar renal tubular dysgenesis, but it fits better with those described after maternal use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The lesion in this case appears to have resulted from fetal exposure to piroxicam. Recently, a second pregnancy ended in a completely normal female newborn.", 
    "204": "The present study was aimed at evaluating the effects of combined lisinopril-hydrochlorothiazide (Zestoretic) antihypertensive treatment on sphygmomanometric and 24-hour systolic and diastolic blood pressure values in 631 elderly patients (mean age +/- SD 68.8 +/- 5.8 years) with mild-to-moderate essential systolic-diastolic or isolated systolic hypertension. After a wash-out period of 4 weeks, patients received o.d. lisinopril combined with hydrochlorothiazide for a 6-week period. At the end of both periods, sphygmomanometric blood pressure was assessed 24 hours after dosing and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure was performed, taking blood pressure readings every 15 minutes during day- and night-time. The drug induced in all elderly hypertensives clearcut and significant systolic and diastolic blood pressure reductions (average reduction amounting to 25 mmHg and 15 mmHg for systolic and diastolic blood pressure values respectively) without any significant heart rate change. The antihypertensive effect of combined lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide was significant during the whole 24-hour monitoring period. This antihypertensive drug regimen was well tolerated, a low side effect profile being observed (10.3% of treated patients). Thus single daily administration of combined lisinopril-hydrochlorothiazide represents a safe and effective antihypertensive drug regimen.", 
    "205": "Tempocapril is a novel angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor which is preferentially eliminated via the biliary tract. To examine whether it has a protective effect in diabetic nephropathy like conventional ACE inhibitors which are eliminated via the kidney, a study was performed in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats for 8 months. Male Wistar rats were divided into 4 groups (control rats, diabetic rats treated with temocapril at the doses of 5 mg/l or 15 mg/l of drinking water, and untreated diabetic rats). There was no significant difference in the blood glucose levels of the 3 diabetic groups. Administration of temocapril at both doses of 5 mg/l and 15 mg/l significantly reduced the blood pressure as well as the urinary excretion of albumin and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase. However, significant suppression of glomerular basement membrane hypertrophy was only induced by treatment with temocapril at the dose of 15 mg/l. Elevated glomerular filtration rate and filtration fraction in diabetic rats were decreased by tempocapril at the dose of 15 mg/l, but not significantly. These results indicate that tempocapril has a protective effect on diabetic nephropathy like conventional ACE inhibitors.", 
    "206": "In the past bilateral nephrectomy was often necessary in treating hypertensive scleroderma renal crisis. Since the availability of convertin enzyme inhibitors, many patients who were dialysis-dependent have recovered sufficiently to discontinue dialysis. We describe a 32-year-old woman with scleroderma who developed malignant hypertension and acute renal failure and required dialysis. She was treated aggressively with captopril and other agents. After 15 months, renal function improved and hemodialysis could be discontinued.", 
    "207": "Diabetic nephropathy is a common cause of end stage renal failure. Patients ultimately require dialysis or transplantation and endure a poor quality of life in association with increased mortality. Due to the quantitative significance of this problem there is also a considerable financial burden. It has been generally accepted that once nephropathy is established it is irreversible although aggressive anti-hypertensive treatment can delay its progression. More recently there have been numerous reports proposing a specific renal protective role of certain drugs. In this article we review the current literature on the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in diabetic nephropathy. There is strong evidence that the use of ACE inhibitors in diabetic nephropathy (in the presence or absence of hypertension) slows the progression of deterioration in renal function and may even arrest its progression if detected at the microproteinuric stage.", 
    "208": "The authors reports an unrecognised secondary effect, but perhaps not as rare as has been thought, of enalapril: the acute abdomen. Three similar cases have previously been reported. The underlying mechanism is probably the inhibition of degradation of tissue kinins to inactive peptides as in subcutaneous and/or submucous angioneurotic oedema. Todate, this secondary effect has not been reported with other angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. The relationship between the acute abdomen and angioneurotic oedema with primary hyperaldosteronism is discussed.", 
    "209": "Nine peptides to inhibit angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) were isolated from sake and sake lees. They were short peptides with 5 or fewer amino acid residues, and many of them had a tryptophan or tyrosine residue at the C-terminus. We synthesized the peptide fragments of IYPRY and YGGY, and measured their inhibitory activity. As a result, we have concluded that hydrophobic amino acids in the sequence and amino acid at C-terminus had an important role in the inhibition. When digested with pepsin and pancreatin, YGGY lost its inhibitory activity but IYPRY maintained its activity. YGGY and IYPRY were orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) at the dose of 100 mg/kg. YGGY didn't change the blood pressure of SHR, but IYPRY reduced their blood pressure. The hypotensive effect of IYPRY continued for 30 h after administration. Also, three dipeptides among the IYPRY fragments, IY, YP and RY, had hypotensive effects, and the effect of RY continued for 30 h after administration.", 
    "210": "The presence of constituents of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in ocular tissues and fluids suggests this system is involved in ocular physiology. Angiotensin II (AngII) is the main biological effector of the system, so we measured AngII in plasma and in aqueous humor of the anterior ocular chamber of patients undergoing cataract extraction. Untreated normotensive patients were compared with arterial hypertensive patients taking either diuretics which stimulate the RAS or angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors which reduce the production of AngII. Plasma levels of AngII were higher in patients on diuretics (5.46 +/- 1.04 fmol/ml; mean +/- SEM) than in untreated cataract patients (2.28 +/- 0.32 fmol/ml, p < 0.02), and were very low with ACE inhibitors (0.51 +/- 0.18 fmol/ml). In aqueous humor, AngII was measurable in 7 of 11 patients on diuretics (median 1.1 fmol/ml), and in 6 of 16 normotensive patients (median < 0.55 fmol/ml), but not in aqueous humor of 4 patients receiving enalapril or captopril. These results demonstrate the presence of AngII in the eye but do not exclude either its sequestration in the eye or local production. The possibility of individual measurements of intraocular AngII will permit more precise determination of its role in future studies.", 
    "211": "The beneficial effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in the prevention of heart failure following myocardial infarction are widely accepted. However, the underlying mechanisms are still a matter of discussion. We therefore investigated the relative contribution of the breakdown of bradykinin and of the inhibition of angiotensin-II synthesis to the beneficial actions of ACE inhibitors in chronic heart failure following myocardial infarction.", 
    "212": "We compared the effects pretreatment with the ACE inhibitor moexipril with those of the type 1 angiotensin (AT1)-receptor antagonist losartan on structural and functional cardiac parameters after myocardial infarction in rats. In addition, the bradykinin B2-receptor antagonist icatabant was used to investigate the role of bradykinin in the cardioprotective effects of ACE inhibition. Rats underwent a sham operation or surgery to induce myocardial infarction. Treatment was started 1 week before myocardial infarction and continued for another 6 weeks after the procedure.", 
    "213": "Moexipril reduced infarct size (100 +/- 9mm2 compared with 165 +/- 8mm2), the ratio of total heart weight to body weight (2.6 +/- 0.1 g/kg compared with 2.9 +/- 0.1 g/kg) and end-diastolic pressure (8.2 +/- 1.5 mmHg compared with 14.0 +/- 1.7 mmHg). All of these effects of the ACE inhibitor were blocked by concomitant treatment with icatibant. Losartan did not affect any of these cardiac parameters.", 
    "214": "The cardioprotective effects of the ACE inhibitor moexipril administered before myocardial infarction in the present study were a result of the reduced breakdown of kinins rather than of the reduced synthesis of angiotensin II.", 
    "215": "A number of 21 patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) of various etiologies were studied. All patients were subjected to a classical exercise testing (ET) on cycloergometer. The ET was repeated 24 hrs later, 6 hrs after the administration of 2 mg Perindopril (Coversyl). No statistically significant differences in duration and intensity of ET before and after Perindopril were noted for the whole group. But in 9 patients (42.8%) at least one effort level was gained. In these patients the peak double product (DP) was similar before and after Perindopril, but at submaximal effort DP was, at each level, lesser after Perindopril, suggesting a mechanism of afterload reduction in the improvement of effort capacity.", 
    "216": "A group of 17 patients with ischemic heart disease, significant left ventricular dilatation and congestive heart failure, class III NYHA (9 patients) and class IV NYHA (8 patients) was studied. The patients received angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor--captopril 75 mg/day or perindopril 4 mg/day--added to diuretics, digitalis and nitrates. The plasmatic level of fibronectin was investigated, by radial immunodiffusion, before and one month after the beginning of the treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. The plasmatic level of fibronectin is increased significantly (p < 0.001) while the cardiothoracic ratio is decreased significantly (p < 0.02) after one month of ACE inhibitors treatment. A positive correlation between the increase of the plasmatic level of fibronectin and the decrease of cardiothoracic ratio is found (r = 0.62; p < 0.01). The increased fibronectin plasmatic level can be a marker of the favorable effect of ACE inhibitor on the myocardium interstitium.", 
    "217": "We evaluated the two angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors captopril and fosinopril with regard to possible antiatherosclerotic effects in minipigs. Experimental hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis was produced in 33 minipigs of the G\u00f6ttingen strain by an egg yolk/cholesterol-enriched diet for 1 year. One group (n = 11) was fed the atherogenic diet alone and served as a control. A second group (n = 11) received captopril (80 mg/kg/day) added to the atherogenic diet, and a third group (n = 11) was treated in the same manner but with fosinopril (8 mg/kg/day). The drug treatments produced significant reduction in serum ACE activity associated with a reactive increase in plasma renin activity (PRA), but had only minor effects on plasma lipids and lipoproteins. At the end of the treatment period, all animals were killed and examined for degree of atherosclerosis. The percentage of atherosclerotic area in the abdominal aorta was significantly lower in both drug-treated groups as compared with controls. Furthermore, accumulation of cholesterol in the thoracic and abdominal aorta was inhibited by drug treatment. Finally, the percentage of intimal thickening in abdominal aorta was significantly reduced in the drug-treated groups. In conclusion, the ACE inhibitors captopril and fosinopril inhibited development of atherosclerosis in hypercholesterolemic minipigs.", 
    "218": "To assess the role of angiotensin II (AII) in development of myocardial injury during ischemia and reperfusion, the effects of short-term treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor lisinopril were compared with the effects of short-term treatment with L-158,338, an AII antagonist, in isolated working rat heart. Myocardial function was assessed and correlated with simultaneous measurement of high-energy phosphate metabolism and intracellular pH by [31P] nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) before, during, and after global ischemia. Hearts from rats treated with 1 mg/kg lisinopril in vivo recovered substantially more function than those of controls (p < 0.001), whereas 50 ng/ml (0.11 microM) lisinopril in vitro had no effect on functional recovery. A dose-dependent increase in functional recovery was observed in rat heart treated with 0.3, 1, or 3 mg/kg L-158,338 in vivo (p < 0.005). Treatment with 50 ng/ml (0.12 microM) L-158,338 in vitro also resulted in increased functional recovery (p < 0.02). Significantly milder acidosis during ischemia and significantly increased coronary flow were characteristic of the improved functional recovery exhibited by the groups treated with either lisinopril or L-158,338 in vivo. Treatment with L-158,338 in vitro caused significantly increased coronary flow during reperfusion as compared with either its control group or with lisinopril treatment in vitro. High-energy phosphate metabolism was essentially unchanged by any treatment regimen. AII antagonism alone resulted in a degree of improvement in functional recovery comparable to that observed with oral ACE inhibitor treatment.", 
    "219": "We tested the effects and interactions of blockade of nitric oxide (NO) synthase and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) on renal function. Six rabbits were studied four times, each at 14-day intervals. The treatments were intravenous (i.v.) vehicle, NG-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA) 5 mg/kg, captopril 500 micrograms plus 3.3 micrograms/kg/min, or L-NNA plus captopril. The studies were performed in random order. Arterial blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and clearance of H2O, Na+, Li+, [3H]inulin [glomerular filtration rate (GRF)], and paraaminohippuric acid (PAH, renal plasma flow) were measured for the hour before treatment and for 3 h after treatment. Renal blood flow (RBF), renal vascular conductance, and GFR were reduced by 36 +/- 4, 41 +/- 4, and 17 +/- 5%, respectively, after L-NNA treatment. Although captopril did not affect these variables significantly when given alone, it completely abolished the effects of L-NNA. After L-NNA administration, sodium excretion decreased by 41 +/- 11%, chiefly attributable to reduced GFR, although increased reabsorption of sodium also contributed. The site of this increased reabsorption was probably the proximal nephron, since Li+ reabsorption (a marker of proximal tubular sodium reabsorption) tended to increase by 8.4 +/- 4.8%. Captopril had a natriuretic effect chiefly attributable to reduced sodium reabsorption in the proximal nephron. When these agents were coadministered, proximal tubular sodium reabsorption did not change significantly. Our data suggest the existence of a functional interaction between ACE and NO synthase in control of RBF and GFR.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "220": "The role of angiotensin II (ANG II) in the development of isoproterenol (Iso)-induced cardiac hypertrophy was examined in rats. Iso increased cardiac mass, left ventricular RNA-to-DNA ratio, and the cardiac content of both myosin heavy chain and hydroxyproline in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that Iso-induced cardiac hypertrophy involves growth of both muscle and connective tissue. Cardiac hypertrophy reverted within 11-14 days after cessation of Iso. Propranolol prevented development of Iso-induced cardiac hypertrophy but did not affect the rate of its reversal. The ANG II receptor blocker losartan (Los) did not significantly decrease the hypertrophic response to Iso. Los injected after cessation of Iso dramatically enhanced the reversal of cardiac hypertrophy, even in rats that received Los with Iso during the induction of Iso-induced cardiac hypertrophy. ANG II, injected continuously at a subpressor dose that did not affect heart weight when given alone, inhibited reversal of cardiac hypertrophy when given after cessation of Iso. Los did not significantly affect the induction of the protooncogene c-fos by Iso. We conclude that endogenous ANG II has a major function in maintaining Iso-induced cardiac hypertrophy but does not mediate its induction. This suggests that different interactive stimuli may be required for development of cardiac hypertrophy, i.e., for initiation and for maintenance.", 
    "221": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are proved, effective agents for the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure. New data suggest that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may be effective therapy for patients following acute myocardial infarction. Results from clinical trials, such as the Survival and Ventricular Enlargement trial, have demonstrated that captopril attenuates left ventricular enlargement, minimizes and/or prevents the subsequent development of overt congestive heart failure, and improves survival in patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction. Clinical reinfarctions and need for subsequent revascularization procedures were also reduced with captopril. In the Acute Infarction Ramipril Efficacy study, patients with clinically evident heart failure following acute myocardial infarction who received ramipril demonstrated a significant reduction in mortality and cardiovascular events. The mortality benefit in this study was evident within 30 days, possibly reflecting differences in patients studied (ie, population with high-risk heart failure in the Acute Infarction Ramipril Efficacy study as opposed to population with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction in the Survival and Ventricular Enlargement trial). Contrary results have been reported in another major postmyocardial infarction trial, the Cooperative New Scandinavian Enalapril Survival Study, which evaluated enalaprilat/enalapril maleate in unselected patients with acute myocardial infarction. This article reviews the recent trials using angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition after myocardial infarction and will explore the reasons why angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition seems to be beneficial in this clinical setting.",

    "223": "The AR described were classified by organs and systems, evaluating the age and the sex of the patient, the indication for the drug, dosage used, and the level of health care assistance received since notification. Previous knowledge of the reported AR was analyzed, as was the possible relation of causality with the drug and severity of the same. The rates of notification were calculated with respect to the consumption of both drugs, expressed in daily dosage defined (DDD).", 
    "224": "Two hundred one YC were evaluated, 111 for CP and 90 for EN referring 160 and 133 clinical manifestations, respectively. The rate of notification was 2.51 YC/million DDD for CP and 5.57 for EN. The AR in the respiratory tract were the most frequently reported with cases of dry cough representing 33.7% of the total YC for CP and 33.8% for EN. Cutaneous AR followed for both drugs. Angioedema was reported in 0.09 AR/million DDD for CP and 0.56 for EN. Reactions were most frequently observed in patients over the age of 50 with a predominance of the female sex, being usually slight and with 80% having been notified from primary health care centers.", 
    "225": "The high number of reports of cough demonstrate that this is the most frequently observed adverse reaction. The distribution of reactions and the characteristics of the patients with the same coincide with other studies. The low number of yellow cards reporting severe adverse reactions may support the favorable safety profile of this pharmacologic group, or, to the contrary, be a consequence of the under-reporting of adverse reactions.", 
    "226": "Human leukocyte elastase (HLE) is a serine protease produced by neutrophils that has been implicated in diseases such as emphysema and cystic fibrosis. An HLE inhibitor may have therapeutic value in these diseases. An active site model of HLE bound to a tripeptidic trifluoromethyl ketone (TFMK) inhibitor, 2, was created from X-ray structures of HLE and porcine pancreatic elastase. Analysis of the model indicated a preferred binding conformation for the tripeptide and potentially important interactions between it and the enzyme. This information was used to aid in the design of a series of novel, pyridone-containing, non-peptidic HLE inhibitors such as 2-[3-[[(benzyloxy)carbonyl]amino]-2-oxo- 1,2-dihydro-1-pyridyl]-N-(3,3,3-trifluoro-1-isopropyl-2-oxopropyl)ace tam ide (5b) (Ki = 280 +/- 78 nM). Inspection of the active site model suggested that a benzyl substituent at the 5-position of the pyridone ring might improve potency by forming a lipophilic interaction with the enzyme S2 pocket. Synthesis and biological evaluation of a series of 5-benzylpyridone TFMKs provided evidence for this proposition. Further analysis of the model indicated that substitution on the 3-amino group of the pyridone ring with a hydrogen bond acceptor could potentially lead to interactions with the NH atoms of glycine-218 and/or -219. The oxalate derivative 2-[5-benzyl- 3-(carboxycarbonyl)-2-oxo-1,2-dihydro-1-pyridyl]-N-(3,3,3-trifl uor o-1- isopropyl-2-oxopropyl)acetamide (5v) was synthesized and found to have a Ki of 48 +/- 9 nM. Unfortunately, none of the compounds tested was active in an in vivo model of HLE-induced lung injury when dosed orally.", 
    "227": "The in vivo effects of alacepril (1-[(S)-3-acetylthio-2-methylpropanoyl]- L-prolyl-L-phenylalanine), an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, and SC-52458 (5-[(3,5-dibutyl-1H-1,2,4-triazol-1- yl)methyl]-2-[2-(1H-tetrazol-5-ylphenyl)]pyridine), an angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonist, were examined on the cardiac and aortic gene expressions of extracellular matrices and TGF-beta 1 in young spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). In SHR, types I and III collagen mRNAs were increased in the left ventricle, and in contrast, fibronectin, collagen IV, and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) mRNAs were increased in aorta, compared with those in Wistar-Kyoto rats. All the enhanced mRNAs in both organs in SHR were significantly inhibited by the short-term treatment with the above two drugs. Thus, angiotensin AT1 receptor may play an important role in the regulation of extracellular matrices and TGF-beta 1 expressions in SHR.",

    "229": "The degree of left ventricular dilatation occurring after myocardial infarction is a major prognostic factor. Left ventricular remodeling is characterized by early expansion of the infarcted region and predominantly excentric hypertrophy of the noninfarcted myocardium, resulting in left ventricular cavity dilatation. Remodeling is most pronounced in large anterior infarctions. Recent evidence indicates that remodeling is amenable to treatment. Several randomized studies have demonstrated that long-term administration of converting enzyme inhibitors not only reduces left ventricular enlargement but also lowers morbidity and mortality after myocardial infarction.", 
    "230": "Probably the most common and irritating side effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors is cough. In this retrospective study the incidence of cough was investigated in 1113 patients with arterial hypertension who were receiving ACE inhibitors alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents. Patients were treated with one of the following ACE inhibitors: enalapril 10-20 mg/day (n:668), captopril 25-75 mg/day (n:234), perindopril 2-8 mg/day (n:90), or lisinopril 5-20 mg/day (n:121). Mean follow-up periods were twenty-six months with enalapril, twenty-nine months with captopril, eleven months with perindopril, and thirteen months with lisinopril. Spontaneously declared cough incidence in enalapril, captopril, perindopril, and lisinopril groups were 7%, 5.1%, 2.2%, and 1.6%, respectively. Cough was not dose related. Treatment was stopped in all patients with cough. In 59% of patients the onset of cough occurred after the first month of treatment (thirty to one hundred eighty days). Cough decreased by 50% within three days of drug cessation and disappeared in ten days. Mean age of patients with cough was 58.7 years and 79% of them were women. In patients without cough, mean age was 57.8 years and 56% of them were women. There was no significant difference between the two groups regarding mean age, but the sex difference between groups was statistically significant (P < 0.05). In conclusion, although cough may occur with all four types of ACE inhibitors, the incidence of this side effect was higher during enalapril and captopril treatment than during lisinopril and perindopril treatment.

In the present study we hypothesized that N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), by increasing the availability of reduced sulfhydryl groups, would enhance the antihypertensive response to the ACEIs captopril and enalaprilat by a mechanism dependent on nitric oxide. The experiments were performed on instrumented, indomethacin-pretreated, awake spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Thirty minutes after a bolus of captopril (10 mg/kg iv) was administered, blood pressure decreased from 167 +/- 5 to 147 +/- 6 mmHg (n = 8). The pretreatment with the donor of thiol groups NAC (300 mg/kg iv) potentiated the depressor response to captopril because blood pressure decreased from 172 +/- 3 to 139 +/- 4 mmHg (n = 6). At the dose of 60 micrograms/kg iv, the ACEI enalaprilat did not acutely modify the blood pressure of SHRs (from 172 +/- 5 to 167 +/- 4 mmHg; n = 6). However, when the SHRs were pretreated with NAC, the same dose of enalaprilat significantly reduced blood pressure from 176 +/- 5 to 151 +/- 5 mmHg (n = 6). This potentiation of the depressor response to ACEIs, due to NAC, was not observed when SHRs were pretreated with the nitric oxide inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; 50 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 iv). The results of this study suggest that NAC, a donor of sulfhydryl groups, potentiates the antihypertensive response to captopril and enalaprilat in SHR by a nitric oxide-dependent mechanism.",

There was no age-dependent change in mean arterial blood pressure, basal CBF, or cerebrovascular reactivity to hypercapnia, but the lower limit of CBF autoregulation rose from 70 mmHg at 6 and 12 mo to 90 mmHg in 24- and 30-mo-old animals. ACEI lowered mean arterial blood pressure but had no effect on basal CBF or on cerebrovascular reactivity to hypercapnia. ACEI shifted the lower limit of CBF autoregulation to a 20-mmHg-lower level in 12- and 24-mo animals but not in rats treated for 2 yr, i.e., from the ages of 6 to 30 mo. In conclusion, the main age-related change in CBF regulation was an increase in the lower limit of CBF autoregulation to a higher blood pressure level. Treatment with ACEI partially restored the lower limit of CBF autoregulation.",

Age-matched control animals underwent a sham operation (Sham group, n = 57). Six weeks after surgery, rats with aortic stenosis were randomized to receive either oral fosinopril 50 mg.kg-1.d-1 (Fos/LVH group, n = 38) or no drug (LVH group, n = 36) for 15 weeks. Pilot studies confirmed that this dosage produced significant inhibition of LV tissue ACE in vivo. Animals were monitored daily, and survival during the 15-week treatment period was assessed by actuarial analysis. At 15 weeks, in vivo LV systolic and diastolic pressures and heart rate were measured. To assess contractile function, the force-calcium relation was evaluated by use of the isovolumic buffer-perfused, balloon-in-LV heart preparation at comparable coronary flow rates per gram LV weight. Quantitative morphometry was performed. Mortality during the 15-week trial was significantly less in the Fos/LVH group than in the LVH group (3% versus 31%, P < .005). No deaths occurred in the Sham group. In vivo LV systolic pressure was similar between Fos/LVH and LVH hearts (223 +/- 10 versus 232 +/- 9 mm Hg) and significantly higher than the Sham group (99 +/- 3 mm Hg, P < .05). In vivo LV diastolic pressure was significantly lower in Fos/LVH hearts than in LVH hearts (10 +/- 2 versus 15 +/- 2 mm Hg), and both were significantly higher than in the Sham group (5 +/- 1 mm Hg, P < .05). Heart rate was similar among all groups. Despite equivalent elevation of LV systolic pressure, fosinopril resulted in regression of myocyte hypertrophy in Fos/LVH versus LVH (myocyte cell width, 14.8 +/- 0.5 versus 20.8 +/- 2.2 microns, P < .05) to normal levels (Sham, 16.3 +/- 0.9 microns). Quantitative morphometry demonstrated that the regression of LV myocyte hypertrophy in the Fos/LVH group was associated with a relative increase in the fractional volume of fibrillar collagen and noncollagen interstitium. In the isolated heart experiments, LV systolic developed pressure relative to perfusate [Ca2+] was significantly higher in Fos/LVH hearts than in LVH hearts. The improvement in systolic function was not related to any difference in myocardial high-energy phosphate levels, since LV ATP and creatine phosphate levels were similar in Fos/LVH and LVH hearts.",

Thirty-two enflurane/N2O-anesthetized open-chest dogs were subjected to 15 minutes of occlusion of the left circumflex coronary artery (LCx) and 4 hours of subsequent reperfusion. Eight dogs served as placebo controls (group 1), and 8 dogs received ramiprilat (20 micrograms/kg IV) before LCx occlusion (group 2). Eight dogs received a continuous intracoronary infusion of HOE 140 [0.5 ng/(mL.min) IC] during ischemia and reperfusion (group 3), and in 8 dogs HOE 140 was infused continuously during ischemia and reperfusion, starting 45 minutes before the administration of ramiprilat (group 4). Mean aortic pressure was kept constant with an intra-aortic balloon, and heart rate did not change throughout the experimental protocols. Under control conditions and during myocardial ischemia, posterior transmural blood flow (BF) and systolic wall thickening (WT) were not different in the four groups of dogs. However, at 4 hours of reperfusion, WT was still depressed in groups 1 (-10 +/- 20% of control [mean +/- SD]), 3 (-18 +/- 12% of control), and 4 (-12 +/- 21% of control), whereas WT in group 2 had recovered to 55 +/- 20% of control (P < .05 versus group 1). BF at 4 hours of reperfusion was not different in the four groups of dogs. Thus, the beneficial effect of ramiprilat on the functional recovery of stunned myocardium was obviously mediated by bradykinin. Since bradykinin stimulates the formation of both prostaglandins and nitric oxide, we tested in a second protocol which of these mediators was further involved in the beneficial effects of ramiprilat. Twenty-four additional dogs were subjected to 15 minutes of LCx occlusion and 4 hours of reperfusion. Six dogs received the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin (10 mg/kg IV) (group 5) and 6 dogs a combination of indomethacin with ramiprilat (group 6) before LCx occlusion. Six dogs received the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) (20 mg/kg IV) (group 7) and 6 dogs a combination of L-NAME with ramiprilat (group 8) before LCx occlusion. BF and WT before and during myocardial ischemia were not different in groups 5 and 6 and groups 7 and 8. However, at 4 hours of reperfusion, WT was still depressed in groups 5 (-10 +/- 38% of control), 6 (-7 +/- 18% of control), and 7 (-12 +/- 14% of control), whereas WT in group 8 had recovered to 47 +/- 28% of control (P < .05 versus group 7).

Ten 1-month-old, cardiomyopathic (CM) Syrian hamsters and 6 normal (NL) hamsters were treated with captopril (2 g/L water ad libitum), and 10 CM hamsters and 10 NL hamsters were maintained untreated for 3 months. Hearts were excised, and backscattered radiofrequency data were acquired from 1200 independent sites from each specimen with a high-resolution 50-MHz acoustic microscope for calculation of integrated backscatter (IB). Treatment with captopril reduced left ventricular mass, calcium concentration, and IB in CM hearts without affecting myofiber size or collagen concentration. The IB from grossly normal regions of myocardium in NL hamsters, treated CM hamsters, and untreated CM hamsters was not significantly different. The IB from the microscopic regions of scar tissue in treated CM hamsters was significantly less (P = .0004) than that from scar tissue in untreated CM hamsters.",

These alterations in material properties of scar tissue components represent a potential mechanism for the salutary actions of ACE inhibitors in heart failure.", 
    "247": "Renal radiation injury is a known complication of both local kidney irradiation and total body irradiation (TBI). TBI is felt to play an important role in the late-onset chronic renal failure seen after bone marrow transplantation in human beings. Two-hundred and eleven WAG/Rij/MCW rats underwent 0 to 20 Gy TBI followed by syngeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT). Rats received either no drug or verapamil, enalapril, or captopril in the drinking water starting 9 days before TBI and continuing thereafter. Follow-up continued up to 55 weeks after TBI/BMT. No-drug irradiated animals developed significant proteinuria 6 weeks after TBI, were azotemic by 9 weeks after TBI, and were hypertensive by 13 weeks after TBI. Survival was inversely related to the dose of TBI. There was a dose-related reduction in proteinuria, blood pressure, and azotemia with increasing doses of captopril. At 500 mg/L, captopril was more effective than 50 mg/L enalapril in controlling proteinuria, blood pressure, and azotemia and in enhancing survival of irradiated animals. Verapamil, 700 mg/L, did not control proteinuria, blood pressure, or the development of renal failure and did not enhance survival when compared with no-drug irradiated animals. We conclude that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are beneficial in preventing radiation nephropathy and that control of proteinuria may be of particular importance in preventing progression of renal failure in this model.", 
    "248": "In vitro studies have demonstrated that angiotensin (Ang) II directly stimulates vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) growth. However, it is still unclear if Ang II exerts a direct effect on vascular hypertrophy in vivo independent of its effect on blood pressure. In vivo gene transfer provides the opportunity to assess the effects of increased activity of the vascular angiotensin system in the intact animal while avoiding an increase in circulating angiotensin or in blood pressure. Accordingly, we transfected the human angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) vector into intact rat carotid arteries by the hemagglutinating virus of Japan-liposome method. 3 d after transfection, we detected increased ACE activity in the transfected artery. Immunohistochemistry localized immunoreactive ACE in the medial VSMC as well as in the intimal endothelial cells. The increase in vascular ACE activity was associated with a parallel increase in DNA synthesis as assessed by BrdU (bromo-deoxyuridine) index and vascular DNA content. This increase in DNA synthesis was abolished by the in vivo administration of an Ang II receptor-specific antagonist (DuP 753). Morphometry at 2 wk after transfection revealed an increase in the wall to lumen ratio of the ACE-transfected blood vessel as compared with control vector transfected vessels. This was accompanied by increases in protein and DNA contents without an increase in cell number. Local transfection of ACE vector did not result in systemic effects such as increased blood pressure, heart rate, or serum ACE activity. These morphological changes were abolished by the administration of the Ang II receptor antagonist. In this study, we used in vivo gene transfer to increase local expression of vascular angiotensin converting enzyme and provided proof that increased autocrine/paracrine angiotensin can directly cause vascular hypertrophy independent of systemic factors and hemodynamic effects. This approach has important potentials for defining the role of autocrine/paracrine substances in vascular biology and hypertension.", 
    "249": "Subthreshold concentrations of angiotensin II (Ang II) potentiate agonist-induced tone in a variety of blood vessels. We measured in vivo the mesenteric artery diameter and blood flow in 12-week-old normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats (n = 20) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR, n = 20); systemic blood pressure was monitored continuously. Phenylephrine (10 mumol/L) superfused on the exteriorized mesentery reduced arterial diameter from 480 +/- 40 to 256 +/- 18 microns (P < .05) in WKY rats and from 562 +/- 26 to 273 +/- 7 microns (P < .05) in SHR, whereas blood flow was lowered by 77% in WKY rats and 76% in SHR (P < .05 in both strains). Topical superfusion of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (perindoprilat, 10 and 100 mumol/L) attenuated the phenylephrine-induced decrease in diameter and blood flow in both strains (P < .05). The Ang II type 1 receptor blocker losartan (10 mumol/L) attenuated the phenylephrine-induced decrease in diameter and blood flow in both strains (P < .05). The relaxing effect of losartan was significantly accentuated by the addition of perindoprilat (10 mumol/L) to the superfusate (P < .05 in both strains). Systemic blood pressure was unaffected by the topical application of phenylephrine (10 mumol/L), perindoprilat (10 or 100 mumol/L), or losartan (10 mumol/L). We conclude that phenylephrine-induced tone impairment by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and Ang II type 1 receptor blockade in vivo probably reflects the role of endogenous Ang II in the potentiation of the adrenergic response during the control of vascular tone. This role is identical in both normotensive and hypertensive rats.",

To determine whether similar effects could be observed in an autosomal dominant model of polycystic kidney disease, heterozygous cystic (Cy/+) and homozygous normal (+/+) Han:SPRD rats were divided into experimental groups at 3 weeks of age. The first study included four groups receiving enalapril (50 mg/L), losartan (400 mg/L), hydralazine (80 mg/L), or no drug in their drinking water. The second study included four groups fed a sodium-deficient diet or the same diet supplemented with 0.25%, 0.6%, or 3.3% sodium chloride. The Cy/+ rats receiving enalapril had lower kidney weights and histologic scores than those in the control group, and lower kidney weights, plasma creatinines, and histologic scores than those in the hydralazine group. The Cy/+ rats receiving losartan had lower plasma creatinines and histologic scores than those in the control and hydralazine treatment groups. A sodium-deficient diet markedly blunted the growth of the animals and the development of cystic disease. Increases in the sodium content of the diet in the other three groups were accompanied by higher relative kidney weights and histology scores, while the levels of plasma creatinine were not significantly different. Regression of the cystic disease was observed between 3 and 4 months of age. These results indicate that the development of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease in the rat can be modulated by pharmacologic and nutritional factors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

We evaluated BP, serum ACE activity, and clinical status when a low, first dose of ENAL (2.5 mg, n = 59) or CAP (6.25 mg, n = 58) was administered in a double-blind, randomized, and parallel fashion to 117 patients with mild to moderate heart failure. BP and serum ACE activity were measured at 30 min and hourly for 8 hours after drug administration. BP decreases were similar for both groups (mean supine BP -6.2/-4.8 mm Hg for ENAL vs -8.3/-6.4 mm Hg for CAP; mean standing BP -9.2/-5.6 mm Hg for ENAL vs -10.0/-4.7 mm Hg for CAP). Although the maximum mean decrease in BP occurred at hours 4 and 5 in the ENAL group and hours 1 and 2 in the CAP group, considerable between-group overlap was observed for individual patients. Decreases in mean serum ACE activity occurred earlier and were of shorter duration in the CAP group. ENAL significantly inhibited serum ACE activity to a greater extent than did CAP at all time points except the 1st hour.

Using five or more cases of drug-induced lichen planus reported in at least three separate reports with at least one case of probable cause by the scale of Naranjo et al as criteria, sufficient evidence exists that beta-blockers, methyldopa, penicillamine, quinidine, and quinine play a role in this disorder. Evidence is insufficient for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, sulfonylurea agents, carbamazepine, gold, lithium, and a host of miscellaneous drugs.

Resting [Ca2+]i was not affected by captopril in MC from either SHR or WKY. Captopril inhibited the Ang II-induced [Ca2+]i increase in MC from both SHR and WKY in a dose-dependent and time-dependent fashion. The preincubation of MC with 1 mumol/liter captopril for 40 minutes significantly reduced the Ang II-induced [Ca2+]i increase in SHR from 167 +/- 30 nmol/liter (N = 17) to 74 +/- 20 nmol/liter (N = 8, P < 0.05) and in WKY from 102 +/- 42 nmol/liter (N = 14) to 43 +/- 12 nmol/liter (N = 7, P < 0.05). After removal of external calcium there was no significant effect of captopril on the Ang II-induced [Ca2+]i increase. With the Mn2+ quenching technique, it was confirmed that captopril affects Ca2+ influx. Phospholipase C activity as estimated by diacylglycerol formation was not changed by captopril. The preincubation of MC with 1 mumol/liter captopril for 40 minutes significantly reduced the PDGF-induced [Ca2+]i increase in SHR from 166 +/-54 nmol/liter (N = 9) to 31 +/- 19 nmol/liter (N = 6, P < 0.01) and in WKY from 127 +/- 31 nmol/liter (N = 11) to 61 +/- 32 nmol/liter (N = 5, P < 0.05). Similarly captopril reduced the [Ca2+]i increase induced by endothelin and vasopressin.

Recent studies, however, suggest that the cardioprotective effect produced by these drugs is complex and may not be solely related to inhibition of the generation of angiotensin II. An alternative pathway for the generation of angiotensin II from angiotensin I has been proposed, following the recent identification of a chymotrypsin-like protease (chymase) that may contribute to the formation of angiotensin II in human heart tissue. The enzyme is present in cardiac mast cells and displays unusual substrate specificity for the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. While biochemical studies have provided convincing evidence for a chymase-dependent production of angiotensin II, the contribution of this enzyme to the physiologic or pathological regulation of arterial pressure and cardiac function remains undetermined.", 
    "264": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) functions as a primary regulator in the short-term and long-term control of blood pressure. Pharmacologic inhibition of the RAS with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition is effective for treating systemic hypertension and congestive heart failure. As a more specific therapy, the development of renin inhibitors has evolved through various approaches: specific renin antibodies, peptides developed from prosegments of renin precursor, oligopeptides related to pepstatin a universal inhibitor of aspartyl proteinase enzyme, and analogs of angiotensinogen (the renin substrate). Angiotensinogen analogs are promising as therapeutic agents because of high potency, metabolic stability, and good oral bioavailability. Ongoing research is directed towards the application of renin inhibition, the treatment of various cardiovascular disorders, and as a biological probe for understanding the role of the RAS in control of blood pressure and blood volume.",

PRA and aldosterone secretion was stimulated by a vertical position and by administration of 40 mg furosemide by the i.v. This test proved suitable for assessment of secondary arterial hypertension in different forms of primary hyperaldosteronism and for expressing suspicion of renovascular hypertension and hypertension with affection of the renal arteries resp. Based on PRA levels, arterial hypertension can be divided into normorenin, high-renin and low-renin hypertension. This classification is, however, of no value for selection of treatment and the prognosis of hypertension. Each level of PRA can be associated with three different aldosterone levels. PRA and aldosterone did not correlate with urinary K, Na excretion nor with blood pressure. During treatment with ACE inhibitor PRA rose while basal as well as stimulated aldosterone levels declined. After administration of betablockers basal as well as stimulated PRA and aldosterone levels declined.",

Nonsignificant reductions were recorded after treatments with either angiotensin II or hypertonic NaCl. Meal-related hyperdipsia, and resultant possible hyperhydration, of desalivate rats does not account fully for these reductions in experimental thirsts. The mean 24-h intake of three concentrations of NaCl, in choice with water, showed no difference in the preferences for NaCl of desalivate and sham-operated animals.

In the kidney, the preglomerular and postglomerular vessels constrict to protect the glomerular capillary from increased hydrostatic pressure, further increasing peripheral resistance. Because the renal microcirculation adjusts to maintain glomerular filtration and blood flow, antihypertensive agents that can normalize the pressure and blood flow in these vessels may help prevent the long-term consequences of hypertension. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors directly affect preglomerular and postglomerular resistance, but they further decrease postglomerular resistance. Calcium antagonists selectively decrease preglomerular resistance. The diuretics, vasodilators, alpha blockers, and beta blockers may also cause changes in preglomerular and postglomerular resistance; however, compensatory reflex responses may mitigate their direct effects.",

The inhibitory effects of delapril were more prominent than those of nilvadipine, although both drugs reduced right ventricular pressure to the same extent. Calcium transients in delapril treated rats were similar to those in control rats. On the other hand, the calcium transient in nilvadipine treated rats was decreased and its time course was prolonged. The changes were similar to those found in monocrotaline treated rats. The responsiveness of calcium transients to isoprenaline in delapril treated rats was similar to that in control rats. The responsiveness in nilvadipine treated rats was decreased, and was similar to that in monocrotaline treated rats. Delapril improved developed tension and the beta adrenoreceptor responsiveness of developed tension to isoprenaline.",

Here, we examined the relationship between steroid-induced hypertension and components of the renin-angiotensin system. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were injected s.c. with 0.2 micrograms ethynyloestradiol, 2.0 micrograms levonorgestrel, a combination of both or vehicle, six days per week. A second group of rats received 2.0 micrograms enalapril maleate, enalapril plus ethynyloestradiol or levonorgestrel, or vehicle. Systolic blood pressure increased with both ethynyloestradiol. (6 weeks, +17 mmHg; 12 weeks, +32 mmHg) and levonorgestrel (6 weeks, +24 mmHg) treatment. This effect of levonorgestrel was attenuated by co-administration of enalapril, which also reversed the hypertension seen with ethynyloestradiol. Ethynyloestradiol, but not levonorgestrel treatment caused a significant increase in plasma renin concentration, plasma renin activity, and plasma angiotensin II at both 6 and 12 weeks. Plasma renin substrate was increased by ethynyloestradiol at 3, 6 and 12 weeks, prior to the observed increase in systolic blood pressure. Combined steroid treatment had less pronounced effects. Enalapril alone or in combination with ethynyloestradiol decreased plasma renin concentration, activity and angiotensin II, and in combination with levonorgestrel decreased plasma renin concentration, substrate and activity (6 weeks only) but not angiotensin II. The data indicate a positive relationship between hypertension and the renin-angiotensin system with ethynyloestradiol, but not levonorgestrel treatment in rats.",

Rats received water or caffeine (0.1%) in drinking water and were instrumented with radiotelemetry devices to permit continuous monitoring of blood pressure. A clip was placed on the left renal artery of rats in both the water (WATER/CLIP) and caffeine (CAFFEINE/CLIP) groups. The clip was applied briefly to, then removed from, the renal artery of caffeine- and water-treated rats randomized to the sham-operated (SHAM) group. Mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) increased by approximately 35 mm Hg within 2 hr of clipping. MABP in the WATER/CLIP and CAFFEINE/CLIP groups differed significantly from the SHAM group, but not from each other, for the first 10 days after clipping. Thereafter, MABP was greater in the CAFFEINE/CLIP rats as compared to WATER/CLIP rats. At 4.5 weeks after clipping, MABP values differed significantly in the CAFFEINE/CLIP, WATER/CLIP and SHAM rats (140 +/- 4, 122 +/- 4 and 103 +/- 2 mm Hg, respectively). Involvement of the renin-angiotensin system was assessed by treatment with the AT1 receptor antagonist, losartan, and the converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril. Results from this study indicate: 1) hypertension develops rapidly after clipping in rats monitored with telemetry; 2) the renin-angiotensin system is involved in maintaining hypertension in 2K1C rats even beyond 4 weeks after clipping; and 3) caffeine augments the increase of blood pressure in 2K1C rats, apparently through the involvement of the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "285": "Many patients with arterial hypertension have abnormal urinary excretion levels of albumin. This study was aimed at examining the effects of lisinopril and amlodipine on urinary excretion of albumin and kidney function. Thirty-six previously untreated patients with essential arterial hypertension were divided randomly into two groups. The first group received lisinopril 20 mg daily for 12 weeks followed by 10 mg amlodipine daily for another 12 weeks. The second group received 10 mg amlodipine daily for 12 weeks followed by 20 mg lisinopril daily for another 12 weeks. The arterial pressure decreased in a similar way with both therapies in both groups. In both groups urinary albumin excretion decreased in patients receiving lisinopril (p < 0.01). No significant changes were observed with amlodipine. This study shows that lisinopril, but not amlodipine, is able to reduce urinary excretion of albumin in patients with essential hypertension independently of its effective antihypertensive properties. It is probable that the positive effect of lisinopril on microalbuminuria is attributable to the modifications in intrarenal hemodynamics or to a change in glomerular permeability.",

Sodium azide (10(-5) to 10(-3) M) caused a marked inhibition in CL production in activated leukocytes, but not of X-XO CL. The antioxidants, glutathione (10(-3) M) and L-ascorbic acid (10(-3) M) were ineffective in activated leukocytes, but caused total inhibition of X-XO-induced CL. Mannitol (100 mM) had no effect on chemiluminescence in either system. Captopril (10(-3) M) produced an inhibition of CL in both systems and this inhibition was significantly modified by pH. Thus, the present study has established a standard screening procedure for the assessment of free-radical scavenging activity using activated porcine leukocytes and xanthine-xanthine oxidase.",

In addition, studies were also performed to assess intestinal tissue uptake and evaluate a canine intestinal-access-port model as techniques for screening absorption. To evaluate the impact of differences in the contributions of passive permeation and carrier-mediated peptide transport on in vitro uptake and in vivo absorption, an esterified prodrug, benazepril, and a free diacid non-prodrug, CGS 16617, were selected for study. Potential colonic absorption enhancement utilizing coadministration of Intralipid was also investigated. Studies in rat everted intestinal rings verified that jejunal benazepril uptake included a carrier-mediated component while that of the diacid did not. Uptake of both drugs was purely passive in colonic rings. Equilibrium uptake and uptake rate of the more lipophilic prodrug was 2-fold greater than the diacid. Benazepril and CGS 16617 jejunal uptake rate at 0.01 mM was 3.5 and 2.5 times higher, respectively, than from colonic rings. Following jejunal administration in dogs, maximum benazepril plasma levels (Cmax) and area under the plasma level versus time curve (AUC) were 5.5 and 3.0 times higher, respectively, than following colonic administration. Maximum benazepril plasma levels following colonic administration in dogs was 2-fold greater than for CGS 16617, consistent with in vitro results. Colonic coadministration of the poorly-absorbed CGS 16617 with 2 mL of Intralipid (within dietary range for fecal fat content) enhanced Cmax and AUC 2.5- and 3.5-fold, respectively, in the dog and AUC 1.5-fold in the rat.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

In addition, minor activities of kininase I (carboxypeptidase N/CPN; E.C. 3.4.17.3) were measured exclusively in human samples.

Experimental and clinical studies have shown the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors on the metabolism, function, and structure of healthy and damaged hearts and these studies support the concept of both primary and secondary \"cardioprotection\" with these drugs. More recently, the prevention of atherosclerotic lesions has been demonstrated in animal models, extending the concept to a more general definition of \"cardiovascular\" protection with ACE inhibitors involving both the heart and the vessels. The potential role of ACE inhibitors on the primary prevention of atherosclerotic disease in humans is currently evaluated in PHYLLIS (Plaque HYpertension Lipid Lowering Italian Study), a multicenter clinical trial in which fosinopril sodium, a new ACE inhibitor, is administered to hypertensive patients with at least one uncomplicated carotid artery lesion. The primary aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of the drug on the long-term (3 years) progression of carotid artery atherosclerosis, noninvasively detected by B-mode ultrasound imaging. In addition to studies on primary prevention, some large clinical trials have been conducted to establish the role of ACE inhibitors on secondary prevention, in particular in patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI). The beneficial effect of these drugs is well established when administered in the subacute phase of acute MI.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "323": "Several studies during the past 15 years have shown that antihypertensive therapy with different types of drugs can reduce microalbuminuria or clinical proteinuria and retard the progression toward end-stage renal failure. However, some authors reported disparate renal protective effects of different antihypertensive drugs in diabetic animals and humans. In an attempt to resolve the controversy surrounding this possibility, previously we reported a meta-analysis of published studies in diabetics with microalbuminuria or overt proteinuria treated with conventional agents, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, or calcium antagonists (Ca2+ antagonists). Here we present an updated meta-analysis of published studies in diabetics with microalbuminuria or clinical proteinuria (UProt), treated during > or = 4 weeks with ACE inhibitors, Ca2+ antagonists, or conventional therapy (diuretic and/or beta-blocker). Despite similar blood pressure (BP) reductions, UProt tended to decrease more on ACE inhibitors (on average -45%) than on conventional therapy (on average -23%) or Ca2+ antagonists other than nifedipine (on average -35%); in contrast, UProt tended to increase slightly on nifedipine (on average 5%, P < .05). On the basis of multiple regression analysis, ACE inhibitor-induced UProt changes correlated with BP changes (r = 0.77, P < .00001), averaged -28% at zero BP change, and varied 1.5% for each percent BP change. On conventional therapy, UProt and BP changes also correlated (r = 0.62, P < .005), but UProt began to decrease only after a BP reduction of > 5% and the slope was steeper (4% UProt change per percent BP change) than on ACE inhibitors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "325": "In addition to factors such as protein intake or hyperlipidemia, hypertension contributes to the progressive deterioration of renal function in experimental animal models of renal disease, and has a prominent role in the imbalance of intrarenal hemodynamics. Reduction of arterial pressure was shown to alter the course of human chronic renal disease. In patients with diabetic as well as nondiabetic nephropathy, the lowering of proteinuria by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors is greater than that observed with other antihypertensive drugs and appears to be independent of blood pressure control alone, whereas albuminuria may be unaffected or worsened during nifedipine treatment. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may afford better protection than conventional treatment at various stages of diabetic nephropathy and prevent the evolution from incipient to overt nephropathy. In patients with nondiabetic renal disease, no unequivocal evidence exists for such a protective effect. In renal transplant recipients receiving cyclosporine, converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium antagonists are equally effective in the control of hypertension and both leave unaltered the glomerular filtration rate. It remains to be demonstrated, using adequate study designs, whether a particular class of agent is superior to another in patients with chronic renal disease.", 
    "326": "Diabetic nephropathy is the only increasing cause of renal failure in the Western world. It affects a large proportion of both insulin-dependent (IDDM) and non-insulin-dependent diabetic (NIDDM) patients. A critical stage in the development of diabetic renal disease is the onset of microalbuminuria, defined as an albumin excretion rate of 30 to 300 mg/day. Microalbuminuria predicts progression to renal failure and early cardiovascular mortality in both IDDM and NIDDM patients. Microalbuminuria is associated with a constellation of other risk factors for small and large vessel damage which include raised blood pressure, poor glycemic control, plasma lipid and clotting factor abnormalities, left ventricular hypertrophy, and insulin resistance. Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors corrects microalbuminuria and prevents progression to persistent proteinuria. Good blood glucose control significantly reduces the risk of progression from normoalbuminuria to microalbuminuria. The treatment of microalbuminuria appears highly cost-beneficial and substantially increases life expectancy. The development of microalbuminuria, for which all diabetic patients aged 12 to 70 years should be screened, should alert the physician to set in motion a program of assessment, monitoring, and correction of all risk factors for renal and cardiovascular disease.",

Therefore, not only ethical and medical but also economic reasons suggest more intense efforts in primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular and, especially, coronary artery disease. The prevention of the progression of heart failure and of the risks inherent in left ventricular dysfunction, including development of heart failure, reinfarctions, and death, are major cornerstones in the ambitious but economically balanced use of our resources. Major trials in chronic heart failure as well as the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor pooling project in heart failure of all major studies have shown almost uniformly a reduction in hospitalizations attributable to slowing of the progression of the disease. In the Munich Mild Heart Failure Trial (MHFT) socioeconomic analysis confirmed the high economic burden of progression to the end-stages of disease: Patients with progressive heart failure had a four- to fivefold increase in hospital costs. The blunting of the progressive course of heart failure was effective enough to offset the costs of drug treatment with captopril in an analysis extrapolating the results of the socioeconomic analysis to the total trial population. Favorable results in preventive treatment of patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction, hypertension, and diabetic nephropathy also suggest that part of the additional costs of medication is outweighed by fewer hospitalizations and interventions. Thus in many cardiovascular diseases angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have a favorable cost-benefit ratio and can be recommended for broader use.", 
    "328": "The Survival and Ventricular Enlargement (SAVE) study was designed to test the hypothesis that chronic use of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril in survivors of myocardial infarction with left ventricular dysfunction would prevent a further deterioration of ventricular function and thereby improve clinical outcome. The study did demonstrate that randomization to the ACE inhibitor resulted in improved survival and, specifically, lessened cardiovascular deaths. The prestudy rationale that less ventricular enlargement would be observed in ACE inhibitor treated patients was validated by an echocardiographic substudy. As anticipated, fewer patients treated with the ACE inhibitor went on to manifest the prespecified definitions of more overt congestive heart failure. Importantly, not only were the manifestations of congestive heart failure reduced, there were fewer fatal events subsequent to development of failure. Although this concept of attenuation of progressive remodeling leading to benefits was upheld, the study also yielded other observations to support the generation of new hypotheses to explain a component of the overall benefit of ACE inhibitor therapy. Particularly attractive, and supported by observation from the Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD) studies, is the reduction in myocardial infarction and subsequent death following myocardial infarction with chronic ACE inhibitor therapy. These clinical observations point to an important potentially modifiable interface between the renin-angiotensin system and the risk of experiencing a coronary atherosclerotic event.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

After the GISSI-3 and International Studies of Infarct Survival (ISIS-4) trials it is now clear that nitrates are safe, but used routinely the small mortality reduction was not statistically significant. In ISIS-4 the results with magnesium were disappointing, with a worrying small excess mortality. On the other hand, routine use of ACE inhibitors in this early phase showed a statistically significant 5 to 10% reduction in mortality. There was greatest benefit in those with more obvious left ventricular damage. Since it is not easy to identify all such patients in the first hours, a policy of initial treatment of all, then later reassessment, is safe and would produce the greatest overall benefit.",

The experiments were performed on chinchilla buck rabbits of 2500-3000 g of body weight. Isolated hearts were perfused according to the method of Langendorff, ischemia was evoked by a 60-minute stoppage of the coronary blood flow. The cardioprotective substances were added into the perfusion solution prior to ischemia inducement. We investigated the following cardioprotective substances: Spirapril (ACE inhibitor), magnesium (Mg2+), and MDL 73,404 (antioxidant, synthetic analogue of alpha-tocopherol). After the 60-minute ischemy the mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake decreased by 43% in comparison with the control group (p < 0.01), Spirapril caused its accretion by 35% in comparison with the ischemic group (p < 0.05), and magnesium increased the uptake even by 52% (p < 0.001). The MDL 73,404 substance had no effect on the mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. On the basis of experimental results we assume that the cardioprotective effects of Spirapril and magnesium can be besides other factors intermediated also by the increase of intramitochondrial enzymatic activity in consequence of augmented transport of Ca2+ into mitochondria. The cardioprotective effect of the MDL 73,404 substance is assumedly caused by its antioxidant properties. (Fig. 4, Ref. 21.)",

More recent studies in patients with nonmalignant hypertension have shown positive effects on mortality as well, especially with regard to the treatment of hypertension in the elderly. Other cardiovascular disorders have also been treated successfully with regard to mortality. This is true in particular of postmyocardial infarction patients, in whom beta-blocker treatment has been effective. Moreover, patients with congestive heart failure have been shown to benefit from treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors as regards total mortality. The most recent addition to our knowledge stems from the GISSI-3 trials in which lisinopril, alone or in combination with nitrates, was shown to reduce mortality in patients with acute myocardial infarction.",

The presence and severity of LVH is best determined by echocardiography and expressed as left ventricular mass index or left ventricular wall thickness. Pathological LVH, in response to pressure or volume load on the heart, is characterised by myocyte hypertrophy and hypertrophy/hyperplasia of nonmyocyte cells within the myocardium. Angiotensin II and aldosterone are promoters of increased fibroblast activity and a significant increase in collagen fibres in the myocardium. Early diagnosis and treatment of hypertension has significantly decreased the incidence of LVH and subsequent heart failure in many countries, but the choice of antihypertensive therapy alters the rate of reversal of LVH and the subsequent development of heart failure. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers produce the most rapid reversal of hypertrophy.

This appears to achieve equal blood pressure control while causing fewer side effects. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium antagonists are newer, relatively expensive drug classes whose benefits can be exploited in certain subgroups of patients. Whether they will lead to improved outcome in the uncomplicated hypertensive patient remains uncertain. New classes of drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system are in various stages of development. Again, they have theoretical advantages over those currently available.

    "341": "The kidney is not only the source of circulating renin, which determines the plasma concentration of angiotensin II, but it is also one of the main targets of angiotensin II. Thus, angiotensin II exerts an important physiologic influence on renal function through its ability to modulate renal hemodynamics as well as glomerular and tubular functions. Moreover, angiotensin II appears to contribute to the progressive deterioration of renal function commonly observed in renal diseases. The availability of new orally active, nonpeptide angiotensin II receptor antagonists lacking agonistic or kinin- and prostaglandin-inducing properties has offered the possibility of investigating further the renal influence of angiotensin II. Thus, it is now clear that most if not all renal effects of angiotensin II are mediated by the activation of AT1 receptors, although the AT2 subtype is present in the kidney. Furthermore, increasing experimental evidence indicates that the long-term renal protective effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors is indeed due to the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system rather than to the activation of non-angiotensin II mechanisms.", 
    "342": "The effect of captopril on the development of hepatic septal fibrosis in a specific experimental model produced by repeated injections of whole pig serum into the peritoneal cavity of rats was studied. The results afforded four basic conclusions. First, the experimental model used seems to be a pure form of septal fibrosis, which depends on active tissue fibroplasia, without hepatocyte necrosis. The fibrotic septa, located between limiting plates of adjacent classic hepatic lobules, and delimiting the classic liver lobule, consisted of collagen fibers infiltrated by eosinophils, mast cells, fat-storing cells (Ito cells), transitional cells and interstitial fibroblasts. Second, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril attenuated the hepatic fibrosis induced by pig serum administration, as proven by a decrease in hepatic hydroxyproline concentration and histological examination of the liver. Third, this attenuation of hepatic fibrosis might be related, at least in part, to diminished mast cell and eosinophil accumulation in the hepatic tissue. Finally, these data may indicate a novel action of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor in general, and for captopril in particular, as drugs potentially capable of reducing eosinophils in fibrotic processes.",

This negative relationship in very old people probably reflects cardiac, respiratory and neoplastic disease in those with low blood pressure, and good myocardial function in those with high blood pressure. Therefore, in very elderly hypertensive people we cannot conclude that a reduction in blood pressure will not be beneficial, e.g. in reducing stroke events. However, the results of clinical trials of antihypertensive treatment in the elderly provide inadequate evidence to assess the benefit of treating hypertensive individuals over the age of 80 years. Randomly allocated controlled trials are required in this age group.

After the placebo was given to the patients, BP was measured at 30 and 60 min. Sublingual captopril 25 mg was administered and BP was again measured at 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 120 y 240 min. There was not statistically significant difference between the values of BP before and after placebo. A significant decrease was observed post C, from 182.6/123.6 to 174.6/117.3 (p:SN/p < 0.02) in 10 min., to 169.9/114.9 (p < 0.04/p < 0.001) in 15 min., to 167.7/112.2 (p < 0.02/p < 0.0001) in 30 min., to 164.3/108.8 (p < 0.002/p < 0.0001) in 60 min., to 156.9/106.5 (p < 0.0001/p < 0.0001) in 120 min., to 161.3/107.0 (p < 0.0002/p < 0.0001) in 240 min. In 15 patients there was a decrease in diastolic BP > or = 5 mmHg, 10 min. post C. No correlation was found between decrease in BP and age, nor with BMI. Pearson r correlation index between the decrease in systolic BP and initial systolic BP was 0.63 (p < 0.003) and between the decrease in diastolic BP and initial diastolic BP, 0.59 (p < 0.005). Secondary effects were mild and well tolerated. In conclusion, C effectively reduced BP in hypertensive crises. Because the efficacy of C, its rapid onset of action and minimal side effects, sublingual Captopril should be considered a first line drug for hypertensive crises.", 
    "347": "The antihypertensive drug captopril was found to inhibit the oxidation of low density lipoproteins by copper in a dose dependent manner in vitro. Up to 65% inhibition of oxidation was observed at the concentration of 100 micrograms/ml of captopril. During subsequent studies with patients, captopril protected low density lipoproteins against oxidation slightly better than enalapril, although this difference was not statistically significant. Captopril had no effect on the levels of Lp(a) as compared to the levels established during enalapril treatment.", 
    "348": "We investigated the effect of perindopril, a novel angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, on neointima formation in vessel walls after balloon injury in rats (carotid artery) and cholesterol-fed rabbits (thoracic aorta). Continuous treatment with perindopril significantly reduced neointima formation in both species, as compared with the control group: intima/media (I/M) ratio (rats -62%; p < 0.001; rabbits -25%, p < 0.05); neointima area (rats -65%, p < 0.01; rabbits -24%, p < 0.05). These changes involved reduction of intimal smooth muscle cells (SMC) in rats and of macrophages in rabbits. Furthermore, perindopril also significantly decreased ACE activity in both aortic tissue and serum [11.38 +/- 0.87 vs. 34.93 +/- 6.44 pmol His-Leu (HL)/mg/min (p < 0.01) and 2.79 +/- 0.28 vs. 38.50 +/- 5.41 pmol HL/mg/min (p < 0.001), respectively], aortic contraction evoked by angiotensin I (AI) and mean blood pressure (BP, 84.9 +/- 3.5 vs. 109.3 +/- 3.8 mm Hg, p < 0.001) as compared with control values. These results indicate that perindopril may reduce neointima formation by suppressing the aortic renin-angiotensin system (RAS). These findings indicate that perindopril may be capable of preventing restenotic lesions after angioplasty in humans [corrected].",

Naltrexone potentiated the inhibitory effect of CAP on NIR. Pretreatment with NALX did not alter SARA-induced decrease in NIR. It is suggested that the endogenous release of AII and/or opioids somehow modulate basal rearing activity.", 
    "350": "Conventional routine renography and dynamic renoscintigraphy fail to yield sufficient diagnostic criteria in vasorenal hypertension, being associated with 21.5% false negative and 33.3% false positive results. Capoten induces statistically significant functional changes manifested by worsening of time-associated indicators of secretory-excretory function of the kidney, glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow on the side of the unilateral renal artery stenosis; relative hypotension in this situation leads to a statistically insignificant improvement of functional activity of the contralateral kidney parenchyma.", 
    "351": "The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of bradykinin (BK), substance P (SP) and histamine on plasma exudation in the skin of conscious dogs with and without pacing-induced heart failure. We also determined the role tissue angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) and neutral endopeptidase (NEP) play in modulating these responses. We found that intradermal injection of BK, SP and histamine induced a significant, concentration-dependent Evans blue exudation in normal dogs (p < 0.05). Bradykinin-induced responses were significantly potentiated by captopril (p < 0.05). In contrast, phosphoramidon potentiated BK-induced responses only at low concentrations of BK. Both captopril and phosphoramidon had no significant effects on SP- and histamine-induced Evans blue exudation. BK- and SP-induced responses were significantly attenuated, whereas histamine-induced Evans blue exudation was significantly potentiated in dogs with heart failure. We conclude that heart failure is associated with attenuation of BK- and SP-, but not histamine-induced plasma exudation in the peripheral microcirculation and that these responses are not modulated by tissue ACE and NEP.",

The roles of the tissue kallikrein-kinin system and nitric oxide (NO) release in Phoneutria nigriventer venom-induced relaxations of rabbit corpus cavernosum (RbCC) smooth muscle have been investigated by use of a bioassay cascade. 2. Phoneutria nigriventer venom (10-30 micrograms), porcine pancreatic kallikrein (100 mu), rabbit urinary kallikrein (10 mu), bradykinin (BK, 0.3-3 nmol), acetylcholine (ACh, 0.3-30 nmol) and glyceryl trinitrate (GTN, 0.5-10 nmol) caused relaxations of the RbCC strips. Captopril (1 microM) substantially potentiated Phoneutria nigriventer venom- and BK-induced RbCC relaxations without affecting those elicited by GTN. 3. The bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist, Hoe 140 (D-Arg-[Hyp3,Thi5,D- Tic7,Oic8]-BK, 50 nM), aprotinin (10 micrograms ml-1) and the tissue kallikrein inhibitor, Pro-Phe-Aph-Ser-Val- Gln-NH2 (KIZD-06, 1.3 microM) significantly inhibited Phoneutria nigriventer venom-induced RbCC relaxations, without affecting those provoked by GTN and ACh. The B1 receptor antagonist, [Leu9]des Arg10BK (0.5 microM) and soybean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI, 10 micrograms ml-1) had no effect on Phoneutria nigriventer venom-induced RbCC relaxations. 4. The relaxations induced by Phoneutria nigriventer venom, porcine pancreas kallikrein, BK and ACh were significantly inhibited by N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 10 microM) but not by D-NAME (10 microM). L-NAME did not affect GTN-induced relaxations. L-Arginine (300 microM), but not D-arginine (300 microM), significantly reversed the inhibitory effect of L-NAME. 5. Our results indicate that Phoneutria nigriventer venom activates the tissue kallikrein-kininogen-kinin system in RbCC strips leading to NO release and suggest a functional role for this system in penile erection.", 
    "353": "The effects of single oral doses of lisinopril (5 and 20 mg) on systemic and regional hemodynamics were investigated noninvasively in a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, cross-over study of 6 healthy male volunteers. Lisinopril induced a dose-dependent (significant after 20 mg) and long-lasting (< or = 8 h) decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP, approximately 11% after 20 mg) that was related to a decrease in total peripheral resistance (TPR), because simultaneously heart rate (HR) and cardiac output (CO) were unchanged. Brachial artery flow (+42 and +47% after 5 and 20 mg, respectively) and diameter (+8 and +9%) increased significantly, whereas brachial vascular resistance (-31 and -38%) decreased significantly from 2 to 8 h after drug intake. Common carotid artery flow (+20 and +24%) also increased significantly, whereas corresponding resistance (-18 and -26%) decreased significantly during the same period. Finally, CO was significantly redistributed toward the brachial and, to a lesser extent, the carotid vascular beds after both doses of lisinopril. We conclude that in healthy subjects lisinopril, at non- or slightly hypotensive doses, dilates both arterioles and large arteries and that this vasodilation is not homogeneous, affecting preferentially the brachial rather than the carotid vascular bed.", 
    "354": "In a double-blind study, we compared the value of different approaches to assess blockade of angiotensin (Ang) II generation in 10 normal volunteers treated with the new Ang-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor temocapril. Plasma concentration of the diacid active metabolite of temocapril, plasma Ang I and II levels, plasma ACE activity, and inhibition of the pressor response to repeated intravenous (i.v.) doses of Ang I were measured before and repeatedly after different doses of tempocapril or placebo. In vivo ACE activity, estimated by the plasma Ang II/Ang I ratio, correlated well with temocapril diacid concentration (r = 0.85, n = 148) and with systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP) responses to Ang I (r = 0.76 and r = 0.79, n = 148). SBP and DBP responses to Ang I were also strongly related to temocapril diacid concentration (r = -0.81 and r = -0.88, n = 148). ACE activity measured in vivo reliably predicts the decrease in Ang-dependent BP to be achieved by ACE inhibitors.", 
    "355": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors can improve cardiac function independent of their blood pressure (BP)-lowering actions. We investigated the effect of chronic subantihypertensive ACE inhibitor treatment on functional and biochemical cardiac parameters in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP). Animals were treated in utero and subsequently to age 20 weeks with the ACE inhibitor perindopril (0.01 mg/kg/day). The contribution of endogenous bradykinin (BK) potentiation to the actions of the ACE inhibitor was assessed by cotreatment with the BK beta 2-receptor antagonist Hoe 140 (500 micrograms/kg/day subcutaneously, s.c.) from age 6 to 20 weeks and by measurement of myocardial prostacyclin and cyclic GMP concentrations. Chronic low-dose perindopril treatment had no effect on development of hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), but perindopril improved cardiac function, as demonstrated by increased LV pressure (LVP) (19.4%) and LVdp/dtmax (27.8%) but no change in heart rate (HR). The activities of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase (CK) as well as lactate concentrations in the coronary venous effluent were reduced by 39.3, 50, and 60.6%, respectively. Myocardial tissue concentrations of glycogen and the energy-rich phosphates ATP and CK were increased by 16.3, 33.1, and 28.2%, respectively. All ACE inhibitor-induced effects on cardiac function and metabolism were abolished by concomitant chronic BK receptor blockade. Cardiac prostacyclin concentrations were threefold elevated in perindopril-treated animals whereas cardiac cyclic GMP concentration remained unchanged as compared with that of controls. Our data demonstrate that chronic low-dose ACE inhibitor treatment can improve cardiac function and metabolism by potentiating endogenous BK.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "356": "Antihypertensive drugs influence the sympathetic nervous system in different ways that may cause adverse or beneficial effects. We treated 48 hypertensive patients with either nitrendipine (10-20 mg twice daily, b.i.d.) or captopril (25-50 mg b.i.d.) for 16 weeks to evaluate changes in plasma catecholamines, platelet alpha 2- and lymphocyte beta 2-adrenoceptors. Blood pressure (BP) decreased from 153/95 to 135/87 mm Hg with captopril and from 155/99 to 137/89 mm Hg with nitrendipine. Treatment with nitrendipine significantly stimulated plasma norepinephrine (NE) from 327 +/- 37 to 446 +/- 50 pg/ml, and treatment with captopril resulted in a significant reduction in platelet alpha 2-adrenoceptor density from 265 +/- 39 to 171 +/- 26 fmol/mg protein. Despite having equal BP-lowering properties, captopril and nitrendipine have different effects on the sympathetic nervous system. Stimulation of plasma NE during long-term treatment with nitrendipine may contribute to possible adverse effects, whereas reduction in alpha 2-adrenoceptors induced by captopril may contribute to the vasodilating effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition.", 
    "357": "Endothelial regulation of peripheral vascular resistance is impaired in hypertension. We studied the effects of different antihypertensive therapies on endothelial function in perfused mesenteric resistance arteries. Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) aged 7 weeks were treated with either the nonpeptidic angiotensin II (AII) receptor antagonist CGP 48369, the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor benazepril HCl, or the calcium antagonist nifedipine (each 10 mg/kg/day orally, p.o.) for 8 weeks. All forms of therapy inhibited the increase in systolic blood pressure (SBP) to a comparable degree (18-23 mm Hg) and reduced but did not normalize medial hypertrophy in SHR. Changes in intraluminal vascular diameter to acetylcholine (ACh), norepinephrine (NE), and endothelin-1 (ET-1) were measured. Impaired endothelium-dependent relaxations to intraluminal ACh improved or normalized with all therapies, whereas the response to extraluminal ACh (which was unimpaired in SHR) remained unaffected. The endothelium-dependent inhibition of contractions to NE was lost in untreated SHR and improved or restored by antihypertensive therapy. In SHR, the sensitivity but not the maximal response of vascular smooth muscle (VSM) to ET-1 was paradoxically decreased. Antihypertensive therapy with CGP 48369, nifedipine, or benazepril HCl restored or increased the sensitivity to ET-1. Thus, chronic blockade of the renin-angiotensin system or voltage-operated calcium channels reduces BP and improves endothelial dysfunction in the resistance circulation of SHR. This may contribute to normalization of peripheral vascular resistance during antihypertensive treatment and improve local blood flow to vital organs.", 
    "358": "Chronic rapid right ventricular pacing (RRVP) at 250 beats/min produces low cardiac output (CO) heart failure, marked reduction in total vascular capacitance, and a shift in volume centrally. The effect of converting enzyme inhibition with captopril on cardiac preload was investigated in this model of heart failure. Eight splenectomized dogs were treated with captopril (6.4 mg/kg daily) for 3 days before and 35 +/- 3 days (mean +/- SEM) after continuous RRVP was initiated and the outcome was compared with that of 5 untreated dogs subjected to RRVP for 32 +/- 3 days. Similar reductions in systemic arterial pressure (Psa) and CO and increases in right atrial pressure (Pra) and total peripheral resistance (TPR) were noted in both groups, however, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (Ppcw) was higher in the untreated group (18.4 +/- 1.6 vs. 12.1 +/- 2.0 mm Hg). Total vascular compliance and capacitance was estimated from mean circulatory filling pressures (Pmcf) at different blood volumes (TBV) during transitory cardiac arrests with acetylcholine (ACh). Pmcf after chronic RRVP was higher in untreated animals (12.6 +/- 1.9 vs. 8.4 +/- 0.7 mm Hg) and compliance was lower (1.9 +/- 0.2 vs. 2.6 +/- 0.2 ml/mm Hg/kg). Total vascular capacitance at a Pmcf of 6 mm Hg was lower in untreated animals (50 +/- 6 vs. 68 +/- 3 ml/kg). Central vascular capacitance was also lower in untreated animals because Ppcw was higher and central blood volume (CBV) as a proportion of TBV was higher (21 +/- 3 vs. 15 +/- 2%). Four of 5 untreated and 1 of 8 treated dogs had severe ascites.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "359": "Since dietary salt loading enhances nitric oxide (NO) generation in the kidney, we investigated the hypothesis that changes in salt intake have specific effects on vascular resistance in the kidney mediated by the L-arginine-NO pathway. We contrasted changes in renal and hindquarter vascular resistances (RVR and HQVR) in anesthetized rats during intravenous infusions of graded doses of the NO synthase inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME). Groups (N = 8 to 10) of rats were maintained on a high salt (HS) or low salt (LS) diet for two weeks. Compared to those on LS, rats on HS had a greater increase in mean arterial pressure (delta MAP; +32 +/- 4 vs. +22 +/- 3%; P = 0.05) and RVR (+160 +/- 17 vs. +83 +/- 10%; P < 0.005) and a greater fall in renal blood flow (delta RBF; -47 +/- 3 vs. -32 +/- 4%; P < 0.01); changes in HQVR were similar in the two groups. The enhanced RVR response to L-NAME in HS rats could not be ascribed to the higher renal perfusion pressure (RPP) since it persisted in rats whose RPP was controlled by adjustment of a suprarenal aortic clamp. Changes in RVR with an NO donor (SIN-1) were similar in HS and LS rats. L-NAME reduced plasma renin activity in both HS and LS rats. After inhibition of ACE with captopril, or of angiotensin II type I (AT1) receptor with losartan, the increase in RVR with L-NAME remained greater in HS than LS rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Ramiprilat, the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor NG-nitro-L-NAME (L-NAME), ramiprilat plus L-NAME, or saline (n = 8 each group), were administered i.v. in intact animal preparations of experimentally induced acute myocardial ischemia. Anesthetized, open-chest rabbits were instrumented for measurement of systemic hemodynamics and left ventricular pressure from which left ventricular +dP/dtmax was derived. Animals were subjected to 30 min of left main coronary artery occlusion (marginal branch) followed by 2 hr of reperfusion. Ramiprilat (50 micrograms/kg) or saline was administered 5 min before reperfusion, and those rabbits receiving L-NAME (100 micrograms/kg/min) were pretreated starting 30 min before occlusion throughout the remainder of the experiment. After reperfusion, myocardial infarct size (IS) was determined via tetrazolium staining and expressed as a percentage of area at risk (AR). IS/AR% was significantly reduced in rabbits administered ramiprilat (19 +/- 3%) compared to those receiving saline (39 +/- 2%), ramiprilat plus L-NAME (43 +/- 4%) or L-NAME alone (43 +/- 2%; mean +/- S.E.M.; P < .05). AR as a percent of total left ventricular mass was not different between any of the four treatment groups. Systemic hemodynamic effects were not significantly different between groups.

    "361": "To evaluate the direct effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, captopril, enalaprilat, enalapril (a prodrug without therapeutically significant ACE inhibitory effect) and ramiprilat, on cellular calcium metabolism, the cytosolic free calcium concentration was measured in cultured rat vascular smooth muscle cells using the fluorescent dye, fura-2. Preincubation with captopril, enalaprilat, enalapril, or ramiprilat for 40 min significantly reduced the angiotensin II-induced transplasma membrane calcium influx but did not influence the angiotension II-induced calcium release from internal stores. Captopril and ramiprilat also inhibited arginine vasopressin, but not the thapsigargin-, norepinephrine-, or the BayK 8644-induced changes in cytosolic calcium. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate pretreatment for 30 s caused an increase in the angiotensin II-induced rise in cytosolic calcium. Although both captopril and verapamil reduced responses to angiotensin II to similar extents, only verapamil blocked the ability of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate to enhance responses to angiotensin II. It is concluded that ACE inhibitors modulate the effects of some but not all agonist-induced transplasma membrane calcium influx.", 
    "362": "A 57-year-old man with a cough and increasing exertional dyspnoea for the past 6 weeks was found on examination to have a loud systolic murmur and cardiomegaly with pulmonary congestion. Echocardiography revealed congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (cTGA: atrioventricular and ventriculoarterial discordance): a morphologically right ventricle with a tricuspid valve on the left, a morphologically left ventricle with bicuspid a-v valve on the right, the aorta arising ventrally from the left-sided (morphologically right) ventricle. The tricuspid valve showed an Ebstein-like anomaly with obvious regurgitation. Transoesophageal and contrast echocardiography defined valvar anatomy, attachment of the great arteries and cardiac chambers to the venous and arterial circulations, as well as absence of a left to right shunt. Angiography revealed a coronary anatomy typical for cTGA. The exertional dyspnoea responded to diuretics and low doses of ACE inhibitor. Follow-up monitoring of the valvar regurgitation and appropriate endocarditis prophylaxis were recommended. As the haemodynamics in cTGA is normal, in the absence of additional anomalies, it is a congenital cardiac defect which can, though rarely, present first in adulthood. Life expectancy depends on the nature of any additional defects and the degree of commonly associated tricuspid valve regurgitation. As this case demonstrates, echocardiography can largely define the anomalies.", 
    "363": "Hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism has mainly been described in patients with diabetes mellitus. In order to elucidate the mechanisms of hyporeninemia in diabetic patients, the author studied the response of active renin concentration (ARC) and inactive renin concentration (IRC) to the administration of captopril or sodium depletion in patients with diabetes mellitus and glomerulonephritis and in normal subjects. The diabetic patients were separated into four groups: Group 0, diabetic patients without neuropathy or nephropathy; Group I, those with neuropathy without nephropathy; Group II, those without neuropathy with nephropathy; Group III, those with neuropathy and nephropathy. Diabetic patients with some complications had slightly lower plasma active renin levels than those without complications. The mean increase in plasma active renin after captopril (delta ARC) and sodium depletion was lower in group I than in group 0, and there was no difference between group II and group 0. There was no correlation between delta ARC and creatinine clearance (Ccr) in diabetes mellitus. Plasma prorenin was higher in group I than in group 0, and there was no difference between group II and group 0. No significant change of prorenin after captopril was observed in all groups, but the mean increase in plasma inactive renin after sodium depletion was slightly higher in groups I and III than in groups 0 and II. ARC/IRC was significantly lower in group I than in group 0, and there was no difference between group II and group 0. There was no correlation between ARC/IRC and Ccr in diabetes mellitus, but significant correlation between ARC/IRC and postural change in systolic blood pressure. In three diabetic patients with hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism, the postural fall in systolic blood pressure was significant, and ARC/IRC was significantly low, but IRC was not high. These results suggest that autonomic dysfunction is a major factor in an impairment of the processing of prorenin to active renin in diabetic patients, and severe autonomic dysfunction may impair the biosynthesis of prorenin in patients with hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism.", 
    "364": "Posttransplant erythrocytosis (PTE) represents a common complication in allograft recipients with normal renal function. Although the pathogenesis is not completely known, an alteration in the regulation of erythropoietin production by native kidneys or by renal allograft have been implicated as the main causes. Traditional therapies include repeated phlebotomies, bilateral native nephrectomies, and anticoagulant therapy. Recently, theophylline has been proposed as an effective therapy, although without general acceptance. Also, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been involved in the development of anemia in chronic renal failure and dialysis patients. The aim of the present study was to demonstrate the efficacy of captopril on long-term treatment of PTE. Nineteen renal allograft recipients affected with severe PTE were included in the study. All patients had their native kidneys and none had a renal tumor or hydronephrosis. Restrictive criteria for PTE were applied to all patients and other causes of erythrocytosis were rationally excluded. Captopril was administered at a dose of 25 mg/24 hr (12.5 mg b.i.d.) during 12 months and no change on the initial dose was made during follow-up. After 3 months of captopril therapy and during the study period, significant reductions in hematocrit (P < 0.001), hemoglobin (P < 0.001), and RBC count (P < 0.001) were obtained in all patients. Erythropoietin levels decreased significantly during the study period, although the values were within the normal range of our laboratory. Captopril was well tolerated and only 1 patient had to be withdrawn from the drug because of dry cough. The present study has shown that captopril, at a low dose, represents a safe and effective therapy for PTE, without remarkable side effects or graft dysfunction. Long-term treatment with captopril in PTE did not induce anemia.", 
    "365": "Low and high doses of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown either to enhance or suppress, respectively, the water intake of rats induced by acute administration of isoproterenol. In order to assess the role and sites of action of angiotensin II (Ang II) in this dual action of ACE inhibitors, rats were administered either low or high doses of enalapril or captopril, followed by isoproterenol, and were sacrificed 1 h later for determination of Fos-like immunoreactivity (FLI) in brain. Isoproterenol induced strong FLI in the magnocellular paraventricular (PVN) and supraoptic (SON) nuclei, and moderate staining along the structures of the rostral wall of the lamina terminalis (LT). Low doses of ACE inhibitors either had no effect or slightly increased FLI along the LT following isoproterenol. Enalapril reduced FLI in some other regions, including the parvocellular PVN. In contrast, high doses of ACE inhibitors abolished FLI along the LT, and reduced FLI in the PVN and SON. Captopril, but not enalapril, induced some FLI in the LT, SON and PVN. The data are discussed in terms of access of ACE inhibitors to the brain, and interactions with structures involved in Ang-related water intake.",

In order to determine its tolerability, primarily the impact on renal function, Spirapril was tested in a single-blind trial with a 2-week placebo run-in phase and a 4-week active treatment period. Forty-nine patients (34 males and 15 females) with varying degrees of renal impairment were included. Their pretreatment diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ranged from 95 to 115 mm Hg.

Renal function was assessed in the beginning and at the end of the active Spirapril treatment period using Tc-99m-DTPA-clearance (representing glomerular filtration rate), J-131-hippuran-clearance (representing renal plasma flow) and creatinine clearance. Particularly in patients with renal impairment, Spirapril did not deteriorate renal function as given by these parameters. Regression analysis revealed a linear correlation between total plasma clearance of the active metabolite Spiraprilate and creatinine clearance. There was no evidence for drug accumulation.",

Their disease progresses more rapidly than that of nondiabetics, due to the underlying cause of arteriosclerosis of which the origin is still unknown. Much attention has been paid recently to the causative role of glycosilated lipoproteins, free radical reactions and hyperinsulinaemia--insulin resistance. Disturbances of the carbohydrate metabolism are accompanied by disorders in lipid metabolism and in the antioxidant system. While proteins undergo glycosilation, free radicals are being released from inflamed cells and, during the course of glycosilation with subsequent lipid peroxidation. Oxidation of lipids and proteins form the basis of pathological processes that might initiate the development of arteriosclerosis. There are attempts to influence the above processes by scavengers--e.g. vitamins, Ca-antagonists, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and antilipaemic agents.", 
    "370": "Hepatotoxicity has been reported with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. The mechanism of liver injury is not known. In the present study, primary rat hepatocytes were used to investigate the cytotoxicity of ACE inhibitors.

Enalaprilat, the de-esterified metabolite of enalapril, and lisinopril, the lysine analogue of enalaprilat, were not cytotoxic. In vivo pretreatment with pregnenolone-16alpha-carbonitrile (cytochrome P-450 (CYP) 3A induction) enhanced the toxicities of enalapril, fosinopril and quinapril but did not affect the response to captopril. Induction with phenobarbital (CYP2B), beta-naphthoflavone (CYP1A) or ethanol (CYP2E1) did not influence the cytotoxicity of any of the ACE inhibitors. The hypothesis of a CYP3A-mediated bioactivation in the cytotoxicity of enalapril, fosinopril and quinapril was further supported by observations of reduced toxicity in the presence of SKF525-A and troleandomycin. The enhancement of cytotoxicity after pretreatment of the cultures with buthionine sulfoximine suggested a role for glutathione in protection, possibly by detoxifying unknown reactive metabolites.",

A double-blind crossover protocol was used with conduction velocity measurements at baseline and after saline (placebo) and Enalaprilat 2.5 mg intravenously. There were no significant changes in heart rate (64 plus minus 9 versus 65 plus minus 11 versus 65 plus minus to beats min(minus sign1)) at baseline, after saline and enalaprilat infusion, respectively, mean blood pressure (97 plus minus 11 versus 94 plus minus 10 versus 94 plus minus 7 mm Hg, respectively), atrioventricular conduction time (100 plus minus 20 versus 100 plus minus versus 100 plus minus 20 versus 100 plus minus ms), and His--Purkinje (HV) conduction time (40 plus minus 12 versus 40 plus minus 13 versus 40 plus minus 12 ms). Ventricular activity duration was 110 plus minus 11 ms at baseline, 110 plus minus 10 ms after saline infusion (p = NS), and 88 plus minus 13 ms after Enalaprilat administration (p < 0.001).

In this multicenter study, 252 patients received HCTZ 25 mg/day for 4 weeks; the 208 whose blood pressure did not normalize entered a 12-week, double-blind segment. These patients continued to receive HCTZ and were randomly assigned to perindopril (2, 4, or 8 mg) or placebo once daily. Mean supine SBP/DBP reductions from baseline for all HCTZ plus perindopril groups were significantly (p less-than-or-equal 0.05) greater than for HCTZ plus placebo. At the start of double-blind treatment, mean supine SBP/DBP readings were 146.1/97.0, 145.4/98.2 and 146.4/98.2 mmHg for the HCTZ plus perindopril 2-, 4-, and 8-mg groups, respectively, and 143.9/96.9 mmHg for HCTZ plus placebo group. At the final visit, mean reductions in supine SBP/DBP were 10.3/6.7, 9.6/8.0, and 9.3/6.3 mmHg for HCTZ plus perindopril 2, 4, and 8 mg, respectively, and 1.6/2.0 mmHg for HCTZ plus placebo. Significantly (p less-than-or-equal 0.05) more HCTZ plus perindopril patients (53.2%) than HCTZ plus placebo patients (24.5%) achieved an adequate response to therapy (supine DBP <90 mmHg or decrease by >10 mmHg). Incidences of adverse experiences were similar among treatment groups. There were no reports of first-dose hypotension. In patients unresponsive to HCTZ alone, the addition of perindopril at doses of 2--8 mg once daily provided safe and effective blood pressure reduction with no added side-effect liability.", 
    "373": "The purpose of this study was to compare a lipophilic angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, ramiprilat, to the hydrophilic agent, captopril, with respect to its efficacy in decreasing blood pressure (BP) and increasing renal blood flow (RBF). Fifty-seven anesthetized rabbits were instrumented for monitoring BP and RBF. Separate groups of experiments were conducted in which the inhibitors were given i.v. and intrarenal i.a. In Group I, ramiprilat (1 mg/kg and 0.5 mg/kg/hr i.v.) and captopril (2 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg/hr i.v.) decreased BP and increased RBF to the same extent. Both ACE inhibitors abolished the pressor effect and greatly attenuated the renal vasoconstrictor response to exogenous angiotensin I. When the ACE inhibitors were administered in graded doses i.a. (Group II), they caused a similar increase in RBF and decrease in BP as when given i.v. Ramiprilat was about twice as potent as captopril by either route of administration. In the presence of an i.a. infusion of the bradykinin antagonist HOE 140 (Group IV), the effect of ramiprilat and captopril given i.a. on BP and RBF was not different than in Group II. In Group V, the angiotensin II receptor antagonist, losartan, decreased BP and increased RBF. There was little further effect on RBF seen with ramiprilat, but captopril caused some additional renal vasodilatation after losartan. A small further fall in BP was obtained with both agents after losartan. In conclusion, ramiprilat and captopril, despite marked solubility differences, produced a similar renal hemodynamic effect and decrease in BP. No significant difference was seen in the presence of bradykinin antagonism.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Urine flow, sodium excretion, and integrated renal sympathetic nerve activity were measured before and during an acute graded VE (with isotonic saline) in anesthetized (Inactin; 0.1 g/kg ip) control rats (vehicle; n = 7), diabetic rats (Sprague-Dawley rats injected with STZ 65 mg/kg ip 2 wk before experiment; n = 7), and diabetic rats treated with insulin (2 U/day sc; n = 6). Blood glucose levels were significantly elevated in the diabetic group (370 +/- 8 mg/dl) compared with the control group (104 +/- 3 mg/dl). Acute graded VE with isotonic saline produced a significantly blunted renal sympathoinhibition (50% of control by 10% VE), diuresis (19% of control by 10% VE), and natriuresis (24% of control by 10% VE) in the diabetic rats compared with control rats. Treatment with insulin for 2 wk to restore normoglycemia in diabetic rats (third group; 93 +/- 9 mg/dl) resulted in reversal of the blunted urine flow, sodium excretion, and renal sympathoinhibition in response to acute VE. However, acute (a few hours before VE challenge) reduction of hyperglycemia in the diabetic rats (125 +/- 18 mg/dl) did not correct the blunted renal sympathoinhibition. The second goal of this study was to determine if enalapril treatment (10 mg/day by mouth) for 2 wk corrects the blunted volume reflex in diabetic rats. Enalapril did not correct the blunted renal excretory and renal nerve responses to acute VE in diabetic rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "375": "The mechanisms and receptor subtype mediating vasodilator responses to bradykinin were investigated in the hindquarters vascular bed of the cat under constant flow conditions. Intraarterial injections of bradykinin in doses of 10-1,000 ng into the hindquarters vascular bed caused dose-related decreases in perfusion pressure that were inhibited by Hoe-140, a bradykinin B2-receptor antagonist. Injections of des-Arg9-bradykinin (in doses 10-fold higher than for bradykinin) caused smaller dose-related decreases in hindquarters perfusion pressure that were not blocked by Hoe-140. Administration of atropine, glibenclamide, or cyclooxygenase inhibitors did not alter vasodilator responses to bradykinin, suggesting that activation of muscarinic receptors, ATP-sensitive K+ channels, or prostaglandin release is not involved in the response to the peptide. Administration of N omega-nitro-L-arginine and its methyl ester reduced vasodilator responses to bradykinin, acetylcholine, and substance P, whereas responses to endothelium-independent vasodilator agents were not attenuated. Decreases in systemic arterial pressure and in hindquarters perfusion pressure in response to bradykinin were enhanced by the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors captopril and enalaprilat. These results suggest that hindquarters vasodilator responses to bradykinin are mediated by activation of kinin B2 receptors and in part by the release of nitric oxide. These data also suggest the presence of bradykinin B1 receptors, mediating vasodilation in the hindquarters vascular bed. These results indicate that bradykinin is rapidly inactivated by angiotensin-converting enzyme in the lung and in the hindquarters vascular bed of the cat.",

Treatments were given by gavage for 3 days before and during the 6-day period of low-sodium (LS) diet. Cumulative sodium excretion during LS was similar in untreated and low-dose losartan groups (0.62 +/- 0.07 and 0.75 +/- 0.07 mmol/6 days), whereas it was significantly increased in groups treated by the high dose of losartan and enalapril alone or combined with both doses of losartan (1.38 +/- 0.16, 1.50 +/- 0.10, 1.37 +/- 0.16, and 1.12 +/- 0.03 mmol/6 days, respectively). A decrease in conscious systolic arterial pressure was observed in all treated groups in response to LS. At the end of LS, conscious renal blood flow (microsphere method) was similarly increased in all treated groups. Creatinine clearance decreased to a similar extent with both doses of losartan, whereas a further reduction was observed with enalapril given alone or combined with losartan. These results demonstrate that the enalapril-induced disturbance in the response of renal sodium excretion to LS is mainly related to angiotensin-mediated mechanisms. However, non-angiotensin-related actions of enalapril may contribute to the deterioration of renal function in sodium-restricted animals. In addition, a high dose of losartan is required to impair renal sodium conservation, thus suggesting that the tubular renin-angiotensin system may play a crucial role in the renal adaptation to dietary sodium withdrawal.",

When normalized to the oral 1 mg/m2 dose of enalapril maleate, the mean +/- SD area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC) of enalaprilat, a pharmacologically active angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, did not differ significantly between the pediatric group aged > 20 days and adult group (83.1 +/- 47.0 versus 64.6 +/- 17.8 ng.hr/ml per 1 mg/m2). When normalized to the oral 0.1 mg/kg dose, the mean AUC was significantly (p < 0.05) smaller in this pediatric group than in the adult group (138.4 +/- 69.2 versus 245.7 +/- 61.8 ng.hr/ml per 0.1 mg/kg). The AUC observed in three younger (age < 20 days) subjects tended to be much greater compared with infants aged > 20 days. The mean AUC ratio of enalaprilat to enalapril was significantly (p < 0.05) lower in the older pediatric subgroup (2.0 +/- 1.0) than in the adult group (3.4 +/- 1.6), whereas the mean ratios were comparable between the two subdivided pediatric groups. The results suggest that the oral enalapril dose would be better determined on a body surface area rather than on a body weight basis in pediatric patients with congestive heart failure aged > 20 days. The oral dosage should be much reduced in infants with congestive heart failure aged < 20 days compared with those aged > 20 days.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Measurements were repeated after complete investigation and treatment, when patients were entered into one of four study groups: (1) treatment success (primary cause of cough successfully treated with elimination of the cough, n = 48); (2) primary treatment failure (treatment of potential primary cause of cough unsuccessful, n = 12); (3) cough treatment failure subgroup A (potential primary cause of cough identified and successfully treated but no improvement in cough, n = 8); and (4) cough treatment failure subgroup B (no potential primary cause of cough identified, n = 19). All patients in groups 3 and 4 were nonsmokers, had normal chest radiography and negative histamine challenge test, and failed to respond to intensive empirical treatment for rhinitis and gastroesophageal reflux. The VAS cough severity was lower and log C2 and C5 higher after treatment compared with initial values in the treatment success group but not in the other three groups. Enhanced sensitivity of airway nerves that mediate cough is important in the pathogenesis of nonproductive cough, and successful treatment is associated with a reduction in cough sensitivity. While enhanced sensitivity of airway nerves is usually present in patients with identifiable causes of chronic nonproductive cough, it is also found in other patients in whom the cause of cough is unknown.",

To test the hypothesis that captopril may prevent neutrophil-induced myocardial injury during acute myocardial infarction (AMI), the authors subjected rats to coronary occlusion for thirty minutes and reperfusion for twenty-four hours (MI) or to sham operation (sham MI). Oral captopril (100 mg/kg) or vehicle was administered thirty minutes before coronary occlusion. The effect of captopril on mean arterial blood pressure was assessed in separate group of animals (n = 8). Infarct size and neutrophil accumulation in myocardium were determined by measuring creatine phosphokinase depletion and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, respectively, in the left ventricular free wall (LVFW). Animals treated with 100 mg/kg of captopril exhibited significant reduction in mean arterial blood pressure compared with vehicle-treated animals (P < 0.01). Compared with vehicle-treated animals, administration of 100 mg/kg of captopril to MI animals attenuated neither twenty-four-hour mortality (56% vs 52%, respectively), nor infarct size (36 +/- 7% vs 34% +/- 7% respectively), nor MPO activity (1.0 +/- 0.17 vs 1.26 +/- 0.19). Thus, in the present experiment captopril did not reduce neutrophil-induced myocardial damage following coronary occlusion and reperfusion. These findings may be partly explained by the negative effect of captopril on arterial blood pressure during AMI.",

Tissue mRNA levels were measured by Northern blot analysis. Renal mRNA levels for TGF-beta 1; types I, III, and IV collagen; and fibronectin in DOCA-salt hypertensive rats were increased by severalfold (P < .01) compared with sham-operated rats. In the aorta of DOCA-salt hypertensive rats, TGF-beta 1 and fibronectin mRNA levels were increased, but types I, III, and IV collagen mRNAs did not increase. In the heart, increased mRNA was found only for fibronectin. Thus, these gene expressions are regulated in a tissue-specific manner. TCV-116 or enalapril did not lower blood pressure in DOCA-salt hypertensive rats. However, the increase in renal mRNAs for TGF-beta 1 and extracellular matrix components in DOCA-salt hypertensive rats was significantly inhibited by treatment with TCV-116 or enalapril, which was associated with a significant decrease in urinary protein and albumin excretions and histological improvement of renal lesions. In contrast, in the aorta and heart these gene expressions were not affected by TCV-116 or enalapril. Thus, local Ang II may contribute to renal injury of DOCA-salt hypertension by stimulating the gene expression of TGF-beta 1 and extracellular matrix components.",

One and 2 days after clipping, renin mRNA levels increased 3-fold and 4.3-fold in the stenosed kidney and were suppressed to 52% and 26% of controls in the intact kidneys; plasma renin activity increased from 8 to 16.5 and to 30.5 ng angiotensin I.h-1.mL-1 and systolic blood pressure rose from 114 to 123 and to 137 mm Hg. We found a strong correlation (P < .001) between plasma renin activity and renin mRNA levels in the clipped kidneys. We also found significant correlations (P < .05) between mRNA levels in the clipped and intact kidneys and between plasma renin activity and blood pressure for the individual animals. Treatment of normal rats with the converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril (5 mg/kg twice a day) for 2 days increased renin mRNA levels in both kidneys fourfold. In animals with unilateral clips, additional treatment with ramipril increased renin mRNA levels 6.4-fold in the stenosed and 3.3-fold in the intact kidneys. These findings suggest that endogenous angiotensin II exerts an inhibitory effect on renin mRNA expression in normal kidneys, clipped kidneys, and their contralaterals. Suppression of the renin gene in contralateral kidneys seems not to be directly mediated by the rise of plasma renin activity or by the rise of blood pressure in two-kidney, one clip rats.",

A percutaneous renal biopsy was performed in all patients initially and repeated in a representative 19 patients with treated hypertension after 4 years. Mean glomerular volume (MGV), interstitial fibrosis (IF), capillary volume, and sclerosed glomeruli (GS) were measured histomorphometrically. Mean fall in creatinine clearance (CCr) was 11.8% after 4 years with no difference between treatment groups or type of diabetes. BP both initially and during treatment correlated with initial and final serum creatinine and CCr (P < 0.01). There were no histomorphometric differences between type I and type II patients or hypertension treatment groups. Initial IF correlated with initial and final serum creatinine and CCr (P < 0.05) in all patients and type I patients alone, MGV correlated inversely with CCr in type I patients (P < 0.05). After 4 years, IF (24.8 vs. 30.0%, P < 0.01) and GS (26 vs. 37%, P < 0.05) increased significantly, and increase in IF correlated with fall in CCr (P < 0.01). Proteinuria and HbA1 did not correlate with indexes of function or structure. In this longitudinal study of patients with diabetic nephropathy, there was a close relation between BP and renal function but no difference between treatment with enalapril and other hypertensive agents.

Despite a 20-fold increase in plasma ANG I during ANG I infusion, urinary ANG I did not increase. Similarly, the 30-fold increase in plasma ANG II during ANG II infusion was not followed by an increase in ANG II excretion, but in fact by a decrease in urinary ANG I and ANG II. In a separate study, urinary ANG I and ANG II were measured before and after the oral administration of 20 mg of enalapril in eight healthy volunteers taking 400, 200, or 20 mmol of NaCl daily. In contrast to the considerable effects on plasma ANG I and ANG II and renal hemodynamics, enalapril had no effect on urinary ANG I and ANG II. Variation of sodium intake had predictable effects on plasma ANG I and ANG II but did not affect urinary ANG I and ANG II. These data suggest that urinary ANG I and ANG II originate from an intrarenal source. The independency of sodium intake and ANG-converting enzyme make the juxtaglomerular apparatus as the site responsible for the production of this ANG unlikely.",

Plasma concentration profiles of benazepril, its active metabolite benazeprilat, and total salicylic acid were determined together with urinary excretion of benazeprilat, salicylic acid, salicyluric acid, and salicylate glucuronides. Almost superimposable plasma profiles of benazepril, benazeprilat, and total salicylic acid were achieved with the drugs given alone and concomitantly. The coadministration of benazepril hydrochloride and aspirin did not modify the pharmacokinetics or the metabolism of the two drugs.", 
    "413": "We have investigated the contractile effect of bradykinin (BK) in guinea pig lung in vitro. BK induces a dose-related contraction of lung parenchymal strips which is increased significantly in the presence of 10(-5) M captopril (an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor) or 10(-5) M DL-thiorphan (a neutral endopeptidase inhibitor). The kininase I inhibitor, DL-2-mercaptomethyl-3-guanidino-ethylthiopropionic acid (MGTPA), has no effect on the BK-induced contraction. BK is more potent in contracting parenchymal lung strips than other contractile agents (histamine, carbachol and substance P), however the BK-induced maximal contraction is lower than those obtained with histamine and carbachol. The B1 agonist, des-Arg9-BK, does not contract lung parenchymal strips. The new BK B2 receptor antagonists (Hoe 140, NPC 17731 and NPC 17761), which possess binding affinities in the nanomolar range, inhibit the BK-induced contractile response in a dose-dependent manner. The BK-induced contraction was unaffected by propranolol, atropine, tetrodotoxin, capsaicin pre-treatment, triprolidine, methysergide, Ro 19-3704 and N omega-nitro-L-arginine-methyl-ester (L-NAME), excluding the involvement of nervous pathways, preformed mast cell mediators, platelet-activating factor and nitric oxide. However, indomethacin, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, AA-861, a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, and furegrelate, a thromboxane A2 synthase inhibitor, decreased the contractile response to BK, suggesting that both cyclooxygenase and 5-lipoxygenase products are involved in this contraction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "414": "Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) participate in the development of myocardial injury during ischaemia/reperfusion and granules released by human neutrophils contain proteases capable of activating prorenin in human plasma and can cleave angiotensin II directly from angiotensin I and angiotensinogen. The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors exert an in vitro effect on PMN degranulation. Isolated neutrophils were incubated with captopril, lisinopril, enalaprilat or ramiprilat and release of lysozyme and myeloperoxidase was measured from unstimulated and opsonised zymosan stimulated cells. All ACE inhibitors increased neutrophil myeloperoxidase release and lysozyme release by both unstimulated and stimulated cells. In the presence of saline unstimulated PMN released 4.48 +/- 0.68% and zymosan-stimulated cells released 7.28 +/- 0.76% of myeloperoxidase content and the enzyme release increased after incubation with captopril (5.55 +/- 0.71 and 8.74 +/- 0.72%), lisinopril (5.43 +/- 0.57 and 9.02 +/- 0.7%), enalaprilat (6.05 +/- 0.67 and 9.20 +/- 0.82%) and ramiprilat (5.82 +/- 0.69 and 9.26 +/- 0.74%), respectively. In the presence of saline unstimulated PMN released 16.71 +/- 1.28% and zymosanstimulated PMN released 34.42 +/- 1.71% of lysozyme content and the release increased after incubation with captopril (21.15 +/- 1.36 and 42.75 +/- 1.95%), lisinopril (23.95 +/- 1.26 and 39.23 +/- 1.94%), enalaprilat (21.34 +/- 1.32 and 41.59 +/- 1.99%) and ramiprilat (20.88 +/- 1.35 and 37.53 +/- 1.95%) by unstimulated PMN, respectively. The ACE-inhibitory effect of these drugs may therefore be decreased by stimulation of PMN degranulation and neutrophil-dependent angiotensin II forming pathway.", 
    "415": "Quality of life was assessed 4-6 months after an acute myocardial infarction in a randomized double-blind study of enalapril versus placebo. Quality of life was evaluated using the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP), the Physical Symptoms Distress Index (PSDI), the Work Performance Scale (WPS) and the Life Satisfaction Index (LSI). The study comprised 36 women (aged 46-85 years, mean 68) and 96 males (aged 39-81 years, mean 62). Quality of life did not differ significantly between patients treated with enalapril versus placebo. The scores were (enalapril vs placebo, mean +/- SE): average NHP 15.4 +/- 2.3 vs 17.1 +/- 2.3; PSDI 9.5 +/- 1.0 vs 10.8 +/- 0.9; WPS 19.8 +/- 2.0 vs 19.4 +/- 1.4; LSI 24.1 +/- 1.0 vs 22.5 +/- 1.4. Men reported a better quality of life than women on most assessments, and non-smokers and ex-smokers better than smokers. Patients with moderate or severe angina pectoris had a worse quality of life measured by PSDI and NHP than patients with minimal or no angina pectoris. Patients with congestive heart failure had a higher PSDI than those without (13.6 +/- 1.7 vs 9.4 +/- 0.7, P < 0.05), while no significant differences were observed in the NHP scores. In conclusion, quality of life was similar in enalapril and placebo-treated patients after an acute myocardial infarction.

The results indicate that pressor and vasoconstrictor responses were unaffected by prior exercise, fosinopril, and both interventions combined. Expression of the responses as percent change from baseline levels provided identical results indicating that changes in baseline values did not mask an altered vascular responsiveness. It is concluded that skeletal muscle vascular responsiveness to sympathetic nervous activity is unchanged after exercise or during ACE inhibition with fosinopril.", 
    "417": "Hypertension is often related to metabolic disorders, such as android obesity, glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia, and hyperinsulinism (X syndrome). Insulin resistance (IR), described as the common link among these disorders, could contribute to an increase in coronary risk. The euglycemic insulin clamp technique has been used to show that different classes of antihypertensive agents have different effects on IR. The purpose of this multicenter study was to compare the effects of captopril to those of nicardipine on insulin profile using the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), a routine-feasible test. After a 1-month single-blind placebo period, 154 patients with hypertension and android obesity were randomized to 3 months of double-blind therapy with either 50 mg captopril twice daily (n = 77) or 50 mg nicardipine twice daily n = 77). An OGTT with an assay of insulin was performed before and after active treatment. Lipid parameters, Factor VII (F VII), fibrinogen, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) were measured at the same time. After 3 months of treatment, the changes from baseline in mean +/- SD values for the insulin area under the curve (AUC) were -24.8 +/- 107.4 microIU x h/mL (-15.2%) for captopril v 6.1 +/- 98.6 microIU x h/mL (4.8%) for nicardipine (P = .072).

    "418": "Left ventricular (LV) filling was studied in 18 healthy subjects and 19 mildly hypertensive patients before and after 50% and 70% of maximal supine exercise using radionuclide ventriculography. In addition, in the hypertensive patients, the effects of oral verapamil and lisinopril treatment on LV filling before and after exercise were studied. At rest, hypertensive patients compared with healthy subjects had a lower peak filling rate, ratio of peak filling to peak emptying rate, first-half filling fraction, and a longer isovolumic duration. With exercise, LV filling measures were not different between healthy subjects and hypertensive patients. In the hypertensive patients at rest, compared with before treatment, lisinopril prolonged isovolumic duration and verapamil had no effect on LV filling; at 50% maximal exercise compared with before treatment, verapamil shortened the time to peak filling rate and isovolumic duration and increased first-half filling fraction but, at 70% maximal exercise, verapamil had no effect, whereas lisinopril did not alter exercise LV filling at either exercise level. Thus, the early abnormal LV filling in mildly hypertensive patients is influenced by therapeutic interventions both at rest and with exercise.", 
    "419": "Hemodynamic theories of atherogenesis suggest that flow disturbances (departures from laminar flow including high and low shear) and increases in heart rate may be important in the initiation, progression, and complications of atherosclerosis such as dissection and embolism. It is therefore desirable to evaluate the effects of antihypertensive drugs on the occurrence of such flow disturbances. Effects of metoprolol, nifedipine, and captopril were studied, by quantitative spectral analysis, in 20 patients with carotid stenosis to evaluate 3 indices of disturbed flow: peak velocity, spectral broadening index and window index (WI). Heart rate (HR), and the product of WI by HR, were improved (reduced) significantly by metoprolol (p < 0.05), and worsened by nifedipine (p < 0.05), but most of the effect was due to effects on heart rate. These findings suggest that most of the benefit of antihypertensive drugs on flow disturbances can be identified by counting heart rate. Further developments will require improved methods for quantitation of flow disturbances.", 
    "420": "1. Twenty-four elderly patients with stable, chronic congestive heart failure, NYHA II-IV, requiring addition of an ACE inhibitor to their existing therapy were randomised to receive double-blind a single dose of quinapril 2.5 mg p.o. or matching placebo after 24-48 h supervised diuretic withdrawal. 2. The effect of treatment on resting supine blood pressure, heart rate, plasma angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and circulating plasma renin activity was compared between groups over the first 24 h after dosing. The pharmacokinetic profiles of quinapril and the active metabolite quinaprilat were determined. 3. Compared with placebo, quinapril caused a statistically significant but modest fall in blood pressure from 3 to 10 h post dose. The maximum fall of 12 mm Hg (95% C.I. 5.4-18.5) was seen at approximately 5 h. Circulating ACE activity was 40% inhibited within 1 h. Maximum ACE inhibition (83.6%, 95% C.I. 76.7-90.5) was observed at 3 h. ACE remained 60% inhibited at 24 h post dose. tmax for quinapril was seen at 2.6 +/- 1.2 h. while tmax for quinaprilat was at 3.6, +/- 0.8 h. 4. Treatment with quinapril was associated with a significant rise in plasma renin activity (PRA) of 8.83 ng AI ml-1 h-1 (95% C.I. 0.30-17.96) compared with placebo. 5. Compared with placebo, quinapril 2.5 mg inhibits plasma ACE by over 60% for 24 h and reduces blood pressure for at least 10 h in patients with stable, chronic congestive heart failure. The blood pressure fall, although moderate and well tolerated, is more sustained than previously described for quinapril in heart failure.", 
    "421": "Renal Na excretion during the 24 h following feeding was studied in sheep. A pronounced natriuresis occurred 3.5-5.5 h after feeding. Na excretion then fell to low levels in animals allowed to drink water, but was significantly elevated above this level in water-deprived sheep for most of the remaining period. Both the post-prandial and dehydration-induced natriuresis were prevented by intracerebroventricular (icv) infusions of low Na concentration 0.3 mol l-1 mannitol at 1 ml h-1, and a water diuresis also occurred. These effects were not caused by icv infusion of artificial cerebrospinal fluid (Na concentration = 150 mmol l-1). As a result, there was a much greater increase in plasma Na concentration and osmolality in the sheep given icv mannitol. Intravenous infusion of vasopressin prevented the water diuresis induced by icv mannitol, but the inhibition of natriuresis was still observed and plasma Na concentration increased by 8 mmol l-1 over 24 h compared with an increase of 3 mmol l-1 in dehydrated sheep infused icv with artificial cerebrospinal fluid. The results show that the ambient Na concentration in the brain plays an important role in the normal homeostatic regulation of Na balance by the kidney in sheep.", 
    "422": "ACE inhibitors have been shown to worsen the kidney damage occurring distal to a renal artery stenosis. To determine if this effect was due to the decrease of arterial pressure or to an inhibition of the formation of angiotensin, we compared the effects of equihypotensive doses of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril) and a long-acting calcium antagonist (Ro 40-5967) in 2K-1C rats. The rats were treated for five weeks with either enalapril, Ro 40-5967, or were left untreated. A group of sham operated rats was used as control. At the end of the five-week treatment period, proteinuria, plasma urea and creatinine were measured and quantitative morphometry of the clipped and unclipped kidneys was performed. Ro 40-5967, despite an absence of inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system, worsened the lesions of the clipped kidney to the same extent as enalapril. In contrast, the effects of both drugs on the unclipped kidney were different. Ro 40-5967, and not enalapril, increased the weight and the glomerular surface area of the unclipped kidney. Ro 40-5967 did not change the glomerulosclerosis index, which was improved by enalapril. In contrast with enalapril, Ro 40-5967 decreased plasma urea and creatinine concentrations. Only enalapril decreased proteinuria which originated from the unclipped kidney as shown by nephrectomy experiments. We conclude that during ACE inhibition the fall in renal perfusion pressure seems to be the main determinant of the renal damage distal to a renal artery stenosis, independently of a blockade of the renin-angiotensin system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

It has been argued that uninephrectomy (UNX) accelerates the development of glomerular injury by aggravation of glomerular hypertension and by an independent effect to promote glomerular enlargement. The present study was performed to further delineate the importance of these parameters for the development of FGS. At the age of eight weeks male rats were UNX and randomly assigned to either control (CON), enalapril (ENA) or Nw-nitro L-arginine methyl ester (NAME) treatment. In all groups glomerular hemodynamic studies were performed four weeks post-UNX. Systemic blood pressure and UpV were monitored for 4 to 12 weeks post-UNX. Kidneys were then prepared for morphologic study. ENA treatment achieved control of both systemic and glomerular hypertension, maintenance of glomerular hyperfiltration and hyperperfusion, increased ultrafiltration coefficient(Kf), and long-term protection against UpV and FGS. NAME rats showed aggravation of both systemic and glomerular hypertension, decreased renal perfusion and filtration with reduced Kf, and high filtration fraction. The incidence of FGS in NAME and CON groups was similar at 8 and 12 weeks post-UNX, respectively. Glomerular enlargement was present in CON and ENA rats, but did not correlate with injury, while glomerular tuft size was lowest in NAME rats, which displayed prominent glomerular injury. Systemic blood pressure correlated strongly with glomerular capillary pressure. We conclude that systemic and glomerular hypertension govern the development of UpV and FGS.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "424": "Both the hibernating and the stunned myocardium are characterized by reversible contractile dysfunction. In hibernating myocardium ischemia is still ongoing, whereas in stunned myocardium blood flow is fully or almost fully restored. Both the hibernating and the stunned myocardium retain an inotropic reserve. In hibernating myocardium the increase in contractile function is at the expense of metabolic recovery whereas in stunned myocardium no metabolic deterioration occurs during inotropic stimulation. Therefore, inotropic stimulation in combination with metabolic imaging may help not only to identify viable, dysfunction myocardium but also to distinguish hibernating and stunned myocardium. The only causal therapy of hibernating myocardium is to restore blood flow to the hypoperfused tissue. Myocardial stunning per se requires no therapy at all, since by definition blood flow is normal and contractile function will recover spontaneously. If, however, myocardial stunning involves large parts of the left ventricle and thus impairs global left ventricular function, the extent of myocardial stunning can be reduced by inotropic stimulation, without inducing further damage to the myocardium. In the experimental setting, antioxidant agents, calcium antagonists and ACE inhibitors attenuate stunning, most effectively when administered before ischemia.",

Enkephalin metabolizing enzymes, total aminopeptidase, aminopeptidase M (APM), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and neutral endopeptidase (NEP) activities were measured in BMEC monolayers. The effect of specific inhibitors of APM, ACE and NEP on the permeability of [Met5]enkephalin (Met-Enk) and a conformationally constrained and enzymatically stable analog, DPDPE, also was determined. High levels of membrane-associated enzyme activity were measured for total aminopeptidase, APM and ACE. Interestingly, the permeability coefficient of Met-Enk was increased 4-fold in the presence of specific inhibitors of APM and ACE. Low levels of NEP activity were measured in BMEC monolayers and inhibition of NEP had no effect on Met-Enk permeability. The permeability coefficient for DPDPE was not increased with enzyme inhibitors but was 4-fold greater than Met-Enk alone. In the presence of APM or ACE inhibitors, there was no difference in the permeability of DPDPE and Met-Enk.

Even under ideal circumstances only 20% of patients who have an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survive to hospital discharge.

Risk stratification of high-risk patients, such as the post-myocardial infarction (MI) population, has been of limited value. Between 70% and 85% of \"high-risk\" post-MI patients, as defined by these screening tests, will not have a sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia over several years of follow-up. The use of beta-blockers and possibly amiodarone may have some benefit in reducing mortality in high-risk patients after an MI. Several ongoing trials are studying the use of serial drug testing, amiodarone, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators in reducing the incidence of sudden cardiac death in patients with potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmias. Although implantable cardioverter-defibrillators appear to be superior to antiarrhythmic drugs in reducing sudden cardiac death, total mortality may not be altered.

    "444": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors protect the myocardium from experimental lethal ventricular arrhythmias induced by ischemia or reperfusion. Hypothetically, such arrhythmias may result from the calcium-dependent transient inward current Iti. It is already known that perindoprilat decreased the transient inward current in guinea-pig myocytes [1]. In the same preparation, however, angiotensin-II decreased the transient inward current, an effect opposite to that required to prove that the ACE inhibitor exerted its beneficial effects on Iti by lessening the action of angiotensin-II. We, therefore, selected another species, the rabbit, in which angiotensin-II was known to have a positive inotropic effect. Perindoprilat (1 microM but not 0.01 microM) decreased the transient inward current from -8.93 +/- 0.80 microA/cm2 to -5.33 +/- 0.74 microA/cm2 (p < 0.05). Perindoprilat (1 microM) also protected from the effects of angiotensin-II (0.01 and 0.1 microM), which on its own increased the amplitude of the transient inward current. Based on our results, we conclude that perindoprilat (1 microM) prevents the effect of angiotensin-II in promoting the transient inward current in the rabbit. Hence our data support the hypothesis that the ACE inhibitor, perindoprilat, might in relatively high concentrations have an antiarrhythmic effect, at least in part through inhibition of angiotensin-II-evoked calcium-dependent Iti.", 
    "445": "We sought to confirm the identity of the tachykinin receptor subtype that mediates plasma extravasation in the rat trachea, and assess the respective contributions of neutral endopeptidase (NEP) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in regulating this tachykinin-induced response. To achieve these aims, we determined the relative potencies of several natural tachykinins and receptor-selective synthetic agonists, both before and after inhibiting NEP with phosphoramidon and ACE with captopril. We also determined the effects of these peptidase inhibitors, and the NK-1 receptor antagonist L-703,606, on the plasma extravasation produced by capsaicin, which releases tachykinins endogenously from sensory nerve endings. We found that the rank order of potency for producing plasma extravasation in the rat trachea was NK-1 receptor agonist ([Sar9, Met(O2)11] SP) > substance P > neurokinin A > neurokinin B. The NK-2 ([Nle10]NKA (4-10)) and NK-3 ([MePhe7]NKB) receptor agonists were without effect. We observed no change in the relative potencies of these peptides after giving rats phosphoramidon or captopril, which suggests that the different peptide potencies are not simply the consequence of different rates of enzymatic degradation. Nevertheless, the responses to substance P and neurokinin A were clearly potentiated in rats given phosphoramidon, indicating that NEP effectively degrades tachykinins in vivo. No significant potentiation was evident for any peptide in rats given captopril. Similarly, the plasma extravasation produced by capsaicin was potentiated in rats given phosphoramidon, but not in those given captopril. Pretreating rats with L-703,606 abolished the response to capsaicin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "446": "Background and noxious heat-evoked responses of wide-dynamic-range (WDR) and high-threshold (HT) lumbosacral spinal dorsal horn neurons were recorded in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), Wistar-Kyoto normotensive rats (WKYs), lifetime captopril-treated SHRs, SHRs with bilateral cervical vagotomy, SHRs with bilateral sino-aortic deafferentation (SAD), and SHRs with either a single or repeated administration of naloxone methobromide (NMB). Stimulus-response functions (SRFs) were generated for neurons using 15 sec of heating of the foot at temperatures ranging from 38 to 52 degrees C. Comparisons were made of neuronal response thresholds, slopes of the SRFs, mean discharge frequency during heat stimulation, arterial blood pressure (ABP), and heart rate (HR). The primary finding was that group mean SRFs for both WDR and HT neurons were shifted in a parallel, rightward fashion in SHRs compared to WKYs. Heat-evoked response thresholds were increased and asymptotic discharge frequencies were decreased in WDR and HT neurons of SHRs compared to WKYs. Analyses of group mean SRFs for WDR and HT neurons of SHRs receiving lifetime captopril treatment indicated they were normalized to the SRFs of WKYs, but detailed comparisons using discharge frequency during heat stimulation revealed that this was due to a statistical averaging effect. Specifically, lifetime captopril-treated SHRs not only showed enhanced neuronal responses to the onset of noxious heat but also enhanced adaptation of neuronal responses with continued heating compared to WKYs. Bilateral SAD in SHRs significantly increased the total discharge frequency of WDR neurons to heat stimuli between 44 and 52 degrees C, but produced no change in the response threshold for heat-evoked activation of these neurons. A similar effect of SAD was observed in HT neurons of SHRs, but the greater response thresholds of HT neurons precluded detection of any significant effect. Bilateral cervical vagotomy did not affect response thresholds, slopes, or total discharge frequencies of SHRs, although only WDR neurons were studied. SRFs of WDR and HT neurons in SHRs obtained pre- and post-administration of a single dose of NMB did not differ. However, repeated administration of NMB in SHRs resulted in a parallel, leftward shift in SRFs of both WDR and HT neurons. In all strains and treatments studied, there were no significant differences in background activities of these neurons that might contribute to the observed outcomes. In conclusion, the hypoalgesia reported in human essential hypertensives and animals with chronic hypertension may be due to a significant attenuation in spinal nociceptive transmission.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

The in-vitro release profile was controlled by selecting a PGEF with an appropriate hydrophilic-lipophilic balance value for the matrix. The microspheres from which 80% of the drug was released in 6 h were orally administered to rats. The plasma concentration of the active metabolite was sustained after administration of the microspheres in comparison with administration of a solution. The in-vivo release profile was in good agreement with the in-vitro release profile.

This SBP reduction was associated with the attenuation of cardiac and aortic wall hypertrophy and that of proteinuria and urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase excretion. Kidney injuries, e.g. glomerular, arterial and tubular damage, were improved with alacepril treatment. Losartan decreased SBP to the same extent as alacepril, but neither renal function nor morphological structure was improved as was the case with alacepril.

A second CBF measurement was performed in hypertensive subjects after a 60 days randomized double blind treatment with either captopril, 75 mg a day (n = 8) or placebo (n = 5). CBF was quantified using the 133Xe inhalation technic and 16 stationary detectors by hemisphere. Comparison of CBF values between hypertensive subjects before treatment and normotensive subjects demonstrated a decrease of CBF in the hypertensive group (49 +/- 9 vs 72 +/- 14 ml/100 g/min; p < 0.001). After the trial the results in the captopril group showed a significant fall in systolic (p < 0.001) and diastolic (p < 0.05) blood pressure and a significant increase in CBF (60 +/- 14 vs 49 +/- 11 ml/100 g/min; p < 0.05).

Patients were randomized to receive either cilazapril 2.5-5 mg or atenolol 25-100 mg per day per day. Blood pressure before treatment was 147/99 and 148/99 mmHg in both groups respectively. At 1 year of treatment blood pressure was 132/86 and 131/85 mmHg in both groups of patients respectively.

We measured repeatedly blood pressure and aortic distensibility (carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, PWV). Statistical analysis was made through repeated measure ANOVA and repeated measure analysis of covariance because of the tight link between pressure and arterial function.

Six-month old male spontaneously hypertensive (HT) rats (n = 11) were compared to rats from the same strain treated with a calcium channel antagonist, nitrendipine (60 mg/kg/j; n = 11) or with a converting-enzyme inhibitor, perindopril (2 mg/kg/j; n = 9) during three months. The hearts were perfused in retrograde isovolumic mode and submitted to a standardized anoxia-recovery protocol. Aortic perfusion pressure and left ventricular pressure were constantly monitored. P-31 NMR spectra were simultaneously recorded and allowed to quantify the changes in myocardial inorganic phosphate, phosphocreatine and ATP. The pH was derived from the chemical shifts of inorganic phosphate and phosphocreatine, and the free intracellular magnesium concentration from the alpha-beta chemical shifts of ATP. Both treatments lowered systolic blood pressure and reversed left ventricular hypertrophy, perindopril being slightly more efficient at the dose administered. Intracellular magnesium concentration, calculated from the P-31 NMR spectra, was 277 +/- 17 microM in the untreated hypertensive group, 311 +/- 15 microM in the nitrendipine group and 401 +/- 17 microM in the perindopril group (p < 0.001 versus untreated and nitrendipine). There was a significant correlation between intracellular magnesium concentration and left ventricular developed pressure at the early stage of post-anoxic recovery (r = 0.61; p < 0.01).

    "464": "The vascular wall itself, through a complex interplay of endocrine, neurocrine and autoparacrine mechanisms, plays an active role in vascular homeostasis. The endothelial cell senses humoral and hemodynamic changes and responds by secreting a variety of metabolically active substances that act locally causing either vasodilatation or vasoconstriction. Kallikrein (KK) and the mRNA for KK are present in arteries and veins. Vascular KK releases kinins from kininogen which circulate in plasma and is also present in vascular tissue. Vascular-derived kinins induce vasodilatation through the release of endothelial compounds (prostacyclin, EDRFs and cytochrome P-450). Disturbance in the delicate balance between vasodilators and vasoconstrictors may play a role in the development of hypertension. Vascular kallikrein (VKK) was significantly (P < 0.05) elevated after 2 weeks of development of renovascular and mineralocorticoid hypertension, and blood pressure was only slightly elevated. However, VKK decreased in both experimental models when blood pressure was increased. It is possible that the increase in VKK in the early stages resulted in increased local vasodilatory activity, thus counteracting the rise in blood pressure. As hypertension developed, KK was significantly decreased in arteries. The decrease in arterial KK during established hypertension is most likely secondary to high blood pressure. When the endothelium is damaged by high blood pressure, diabetes, excessive LDL cholesterol or cigarette smoking, a net imbalance favoring vasoconstriction, proliferation and migration of cells and increased lipid deposition predisposes to specific vascular diseases. Converting enzyme inhibitors (CEI) blunt the proliferative response of vascular smooth muscle cells after endothelial injury. The cardiovascular protective effects of CEI are mediated in part by the antihypertrophic, antihyperplastic and antithrombotic effects of kinins. The vascular kallikrein-kinin system has a promising role in the regulation of vascular homeostasis and some of the CEI effects may be explained by potentiation of the vascular-derived kinins.", 
    "465": "1. Severe anaphylactoid reactions have been reported in some patients treated with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors during hemodialysis with a polyacrylonitrile (PAN) membrane. Generation of bradykinin via contact activation at the negatively charged membrane surface and reduced bradykinin breakdown due to ACE inhibition have been suggested as possible causes. This hypothesis was evaluated in the present study. 2. PAN or cellulose dialyzer membranes were incubated with plasma at different concentrations of ACE inhibitor. The rate and extent of kinin accumulation was dependent on the ACE inhibitor concentration. 3. Bradykinin levels were determined in \"historical\" plasma samples drawn from patients treated with ACE inhibitor at the onset of anaphylactoid reactions during hemodialysis with PAN dialyzers. The kinin levels were significantly higher (2.4 +/- 0.05 pmol/ml) than in samples from a group of control patients (0.29 +/- 0.02 pmol/ml). 4. Plasma kinin levels were measured in patients who developed anaphylactoid reactions during dialysis with a PAN membrane though not being treated with ACE inhibitor. At the onset of the reaction, kinin levels increased to 2.1 pmol/ml in the line entering the dialyzer and to 10.5 pmol/ml in the line leaving the dialyzer compared to not more than 0.12 pmol/ml upon dialysis with other membranes. 5. These in vitro and in vivo results demonstrate that contact of blood with a polyacrylonitrile membrane leads to the generation of kinins which accumulate if ACE is inhibited. It is very likely that kinin accumulation in the circulation is the cause of anaphylactoid reactions during hemodialysis with PAN membranes in patients treated with ACE inhibitors and, in some cases, in patients not receiving ACE inhibitor medication.", 
    "466": "To delineate the cardioprotective actions of bradykinin (BK) and the contribution of endogenous kinins to the cardiac effects of the ACE inhibitor ramipril, we used the specific B2 kinin receptor antagonist icatibant (HOE 140) during myocardial ischemia and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). In isolated working rat hearts, perfusion with ramiprilat (10 nM to 10 microM) reduced the incidence and duration of ventricular fibrillation, and improved cardiodynamics and myocardial metabolism. BK perfusion (0.1 nM to 10 nM) induced comparable cardioprotective effects. In addition, perfusion with ramiprilat (0.1 microM) markedly increased kinin outflow measured by RIA. The beneficial effects of ramiprilat and BK were abolished by the addition of the specific NO synthase inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA 1 microM) or icatibant (1 nM). Similar results were obtained in dogs, rabbits and rats with myocardial infarction induced by ligation of the left descending coronary artery. The influence of the icatibant on the antihypertrophic effect of ramipril and BK in the LVH was investigated in rats made hypertensive by aortic banding. Ramipril at the antihypertensive dose of 1 mg kg-1 day-1 for 6 weeks prevented the increase in blood pressure and the development of LVH. The lower non-antihypertensive dose of ramipril (10 micrograms kg-1 day-1 for 6 weeks) had no effect on the increase in blood pressure or on plasma ACE activity but also prevented LVH after aortic banding. The antihypertrophic effect of the higher and the lower dose of ramipril as well as the antihypertensive action of the higher dose of ramipril were abolished by coadministration of the icatibant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "467": "1. The blood pressure-lowering and cardioprotective actions of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are thought to be based primarily on a reduction in vascular angiotensin II (Ang-II) formation. However, since ACE also degrades the potent endothelium-dependent vasodilator bradykinin, it has been proposed that the local accumulation of this peptide represents an additional mechanism by which ACE inhibitors exert their cardiovascular effects. 2. Incubation of endothelial cells with ACE inhibitors indeed causes an enhanced formation of nitric oxide (NO) and prostacyclin (PGI2) which can be completely blocked by the B2-kinin receptor antagonist Hoe 140, suggesting that the vascular endothelium is capable of generating vasoactive kinins from an endogenous source. 3. Moreover, ACE inhibitors not only prevent the breakdown of bradykinin but, by virtue of an as yet unidentified mechanism, also enhance the potency of bradykinin at the receptor level and reverse the desensitization of the B2-kinin receptor following continuous exposure to bradykinin. Both of these effects may enhance or sustain the bradykinin-induced formation of NO and PGI2 by the endothelium. 4. Furthermore, ACE inhibition leads to the accumulation of Ang-I which can be metabolised to Ang-(1-7) by another endothelial enzyme, neutral endopeptidase 24.11. By activating an as yet unidentified angiotensin receptor, Ang-(1-7), but not other known angiotensin peptides, stimulates endothelial NO release in porcine coronary arteries as well as in the isolated perfused rat heart. This effect is, albeit to a different degree, dependent on the release of vasoactive kinins from the endothelium. The shift in Ang-I metabolism towards an enhanced formation of Ang-(1-7) in the presence of an ACE inhibitor may thus contribute to the hypotensive action of this class of compounds as well.",

    "469": "In 42 patients aged 33 to 79 years (mean age 55 years) with NYHA grade II chronic congestive circulatory failure, a comparative assessment was carried out of the effectiveness of treatment with captopril (29 patients, daily dose 18.75-150 mg, mean 82.5 mg) adn digoxin (13 patients, daily dose 0.125-0.5 mg, mean 0.275 mg). The patients were administered the drugs, depending on the improvement obtained, for 3-5 weeks. In the assessment of the effectiveness of the treatment, the following was taken into account: medical examination, laboratory investigations, chest X-ray, exercise tests and haemodynamic parameters measured during 2D and M echocardiographic examination. In the group of patients treated with digoxin the following was observed: a significant, in comparison to the patients receiving captopril, reduction of the heart rate by 11 beats per minute, decrease of the heart volume index by 50 ml/m2 and increase of the stroke volume by 14 ml. Higher effectiveness of captopril was observed as increase of the maximal workload during exercise test by 21 W and prolongation of its duration by three minutes. It seems that captopril may find use also in the treatment of early stages of circulatory failure.",

This drug was administered for six weeks. The patients had myocardial infarction 6-18 months before their inclusion to the studies. In all patients two-dimensional echocardiographic and Doppler examinations were performed twice: before and after the treatment with enalapril. Left ventricular contractility disturbances and the following parameters were analysed: maximal early diastolic filling rate (EDF), maximal late diastolic filling rate (LDF), EDF/LDF ratio and early diastolic deceleration time (dec. EDF) and early diastolic slope (EF sl.). Enalapril administered in patients after myocardial infarction caused an increase of ejection fraction and increase of the contractility of left ventricular muscle segments not involved by necrosis. It exerted, however, no effect on the changes of contractility index. After the treatment with enalapril the maximal late diastolic filling rate (LDF) was significantly decreased while early diastolic deceleration slope (EF sl.) was significantly increased. The observed influence of enalapril on the left ventricular filling profile may suggest an improvement of left ventricular diastolic function.", 
    "471": "Desulfated hirugen (hirudin 54-65) at concentrations from 0.1 to 2 microM was found to relax PGF2 alpha-precontracted ring segments of porcine pulmonary arteries with intact endothelium. The relaxation was associated with a pronounced increase in cGMP in the vessels. This endothelium-dependent relaxant effect depended on the extracellular calcium ion concentration and was probably due to the release of endothelium-derived NO as indicated by its susceptibility to blockade of the NO synthesis by NG-nitro-L-arginine. In the presence of indomethacin (3 microM) the maximum hirugen effect was significantly diminished by about 25%. In contrast, neither the sulfated hirugen nor recombinant desulfato hirudin at equimolar concentrations exerted endothelium-dependent relaxation. Hence, the relaxant effect did not correspond to the anticoagulant activity. Desulfated hirugen can be assigned to the group of well-known peptides causing vasodilatation via an endothelium-dependent mechanism.", 
    "472": "Following systemic absorption, quinapril is converted by de-esterification to quinaprilat (the active diacid metabolite), an inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). Pharmacodynamic studies in animals indicate inhibition of ACE both in plasma and at tissue sites, such as the arterial wall and heart, following administration of quinapril. Tissue ACE inhibition may be an important component of the mechanism of action of quinapril (and other ACE inhibitors) in achieving favourable effects in cardiovascular disorders. Quinaprilat has a short elimination half-life (approximately 2 hours), but binds potently to and dissociates slowly from ACE, thus allowing once or twice daily administration of quinapril in the treatment of patients with hypertension or congestive heart failure. Quinapril 10 to 40 mg/day has achieved adequate control of blood pressure in most patients with essential hypertension in clinical trials. Some patients required quinapril dosages up to 80 mg/day and/or concomitant diuretic therapy. Titrating quinapril dosages from 10 to 40 mg/day increased response rates without increasing the incidence or severity of adverse events. Addition of hydrochlorothiazide to quinapril therapy improved response rates by approximately 10 to 20% in patients with hypertension. In general, blood pressure control with quinapril monotherapy was similar to that achieved with enalapril or other standard antihypertensive agents in comparative trials. Quinapril < or = 40 mg/day improved exercise tolerance, reduced the severity and frequency of symptoms, and improved functional (New York Heart Association) class in most clinical studies of patients with congestive heart failure. In addition, beneficial haemodynamic and echocardiographic changes achieved with quinapril were maintained for up to 1 year with continued administration to such patients, but its effect on survival in patients with congestive heart failure has not been reported. The tolerability profile of quinapril is broadly similar to that of other ACE inhibitors; pooled data from clinical trials indicated that 12% of patients with hypertension or congestive heart failure receiving quinapril experienced a treatment-related adverse effects compared with 15% of enalapril recipients and 16% of captopril recipients. Thus, quinapril has clearly established a role as an effective and well tolerated alternative to other ACE inhibitors for the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure. While effects of quinapril on survival of patients with congestive heart failure have not been determined, large intervention studies have demonstrated improved mortality rates with other ACE inhibitors. Further studies, including a large ongoing trial of normotensive patients with coronary artery disease but normal left ventricular function, may also establish a role for quinapril in treating patients with ischaemic heart disease.", 
    "473": "The new angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor idrapril acts by binding the catalytically important zinc ion to a hydroxamic group. We investigated its pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties in 8 healthy men: Increasing doses of 1, 5, and 25 mg idrapril as well as placebo or 5 mg captopril were administered intravenously (i.v.) at 1-week intervals. Six of the subjects received 100 mg idrapril orally (p.o.) last, and two ingested oral placebo as a double-blind control. Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) remained unchanged. No serious side effects were observed. ACE inhibition in vivo was evaluated by changes in the ratio of specifically measured plasma angiotensin II (AngII) and AngI concentrations determined by high-performance liquid chromatography/radioimmunoassay (HPLC/RIA) techniques. Plasma ACE activity in vitro was estimated by radioenzymatic assay; it was suppressed by > or = 93% at 15 min after injection of 25 mg idrapril or 5 mg captopril and by 96% 2 h after idrapril intake. Mean AngII levels were decreased dose dependently at 15 min after idrapril injections. At the same time, plasma renin activity (PRA) and AngI increased according to the doses. The AngII/AngI ratio was clearly related to plasma idrapril levels (r = -0.88, n = 60). Oral idrapril inhibited ACE maximally at 1-4 h after dosing, when < 7% of initial ACE activity was observed in vitro and in vivo. Idrapril is a safe and efficient ACE inhibitor in human subjects. It is well absorbed orally. Besides having a slightly slower onset of action, idrapril has pharmacodynamic effects comparable to those of captopril.",

The differences in systolic BP (SBP) reductions were statistically significant in favor of each of the moexipril groups over the placebo group at all trough time-points. Adjusted mean changes in sitting SBP were 10.9, 12.0, and 11.7 mm Hg, respectively, as compared with a reduction of 0.6 mm Hg in the placebo group (p < 0.001).

During the 13-week study, 28% of all patients (xamoterol, 104; placebo, 42) received potassium-sparing diuretics. All groups were comparable in hemodynamics and dose of other diuretics. At study end, patients with or without PSD showed no significant differences in serum K+ or creatinine, independent of xamoterol or placebo therapy. Mortality rate was consistently lower: 4.6% in patients with PSD and 8.5% in patients without PSD, although statistical significance was not reached. As compared with baseline, K+ values of 6 patients with and 17 patients without PSD had increased by > 5.0 mM at study end (p = NS); 1 patient with and 11 patients without PSD had a creatinine level > 180 microM (p = NS). For 3 patients receiving PSD, and 2 patients not receiving PSD because of renal impairment, study was discontinued because of hyperpotassemia. No significant differences were noted in long and short action or different dosages of ACE inhibitors. PSD may be administered concomitantly with ACE inhibitors, but serum K+ should be monitored as with other diuretics.", 
    "476": "Heart failure has emerged as a major cardiovascular public health syndrome with increasing incidence, reduced quality life, risk of progression, and high mortality. It's therapy still continues to pose a major clinical problem. The main goals of therapy are: improving the quality life and prolonging the survival. For many years digitalis and diuretics have been the cornerstones of pharmacologic treatment recently completed with vasodilators. Regarding the results of experimental and clinical investigations efforts to refine therapy have focused on choosing a combination of drugs particularly those that effectively inhibit the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) system. The ACE inhibitors proved to be effective in managing heart failure of all degrees of severity including left ventricular dysfunction and end-stage of syndrome and in prolonging survival in patients. Spironolactone which inhibits the activity of aldosterone may exert an independent and additive effect to that of ACE inhibitors. The standard therapy of heart failure became: digitalis, diuretics--including spironolactone--and ACE inhibitors. In end-stage of heart failure refractory to therapy the only choice is heart transplantation.", 
    "477": "A sprightly 79-year-old woman was treated for high blood pressure with indapamide (2.5 mg/day) and the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor lisinopril (5 mg/day). About 12 months after starting treatment a blood count carried out because of a syncopal attack revealed pancytopenia (haemoglobin 3.3 g/dl, erythrocytes 1.0 x 10(6)/microliters, leucocytes 1100/microliters, platelets 8000/microliters). Until then the blood count had been unremarkable. The bone marrow showed severe hypoplasia of all three cell lines with reactive plasmocytosis. Malignant cells were not present. The patient received a total of nine units of erythrocytes and seven units of platelets. Her care included reverse barrier nursing and antibiotic treatment. She was also given high dose steroid therapy (methylprednisone up to 150 mg/day) and granulocyte colony stimulating factor (filgrastim 300 micrograms/day subcutaneously for 25 days), and after a latent period of several weeks juvenile myeloid precursors reappeared in the blood. Before discharge from hospital the results rose to subnormal levels without further transfusions (haemoglobin 8.5/dl, erythrocytes 3.1 x 10(6)/microliters, leucocytes 3900/microliters, platelets 21.000/microliters). In the bone marrow, all three cell lines were beginning to recover. The final diagnosis was incompletely reversible pancytopenia resulting from secondary aplastic anaemia during ACE inhibitor therapy.", 
    "478": "A 52-year-old female was hospitalized with malaise, pruritus, jaundice, abdominal discomfort and vomiting. For 20 weeks she had been taking enalapril (Reniten) for hypertension. Serum aminotransferases and bilirubin were highly elevated with prolonged thromboplastin time. There was no evidence for extrahepatic cholestasis in ultrasonography. Serological investigations for a viral etiology of the liver failure were negative and the patient had no risk factors for viral hepatitis or exposure to hepatotoxic substances. Liver puncture revealed hepatitis of the fulminant viral hepatitis type, a picture that can be seen in a drug-induced hepatitis. The complete recovery of liver function after cessation of enalapril administration suggests acute toxic hepatitis due to enalapril. A metabolically mediated idiosyncratic reaction is the most plausible. Potential mechanisms of enalapril-induced hepatotoxicity are discussed and the current literature is surveyed.", 
    "479": "The beneficial effect of a low-protein diet on the course of renal failure after ablation nephropathy in the rat is known; also calcium channel antagonists (CaA) and angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) have a protective effect. Because even simple energy restriction retards the development of spontaneous or ablation-induced glomerulosclerosis the authors decided to replace the lacking dietary protein in the low protein diet by starch (disaccharide) and by fat (cereal oil) and compare these two low-protein diets as to their effect on the development of chronic renal failure (CRI) caused by surgical removal of 5/6 of renal parenchyma (5/6 NX).", 
    "480": "In Wistar rats just after weaning, 5/6 of renal parenchyma were removed surgically. Thereafter, the rats were fed either a \"high-protein\" (21%) or two types of a \"low-protein\" (6%) diet, in one of the latter, the lack of protein was substituted by saccharide, in the other by fat making the substitution \"isocaloric\" in either case. In all three diet groups, subgroups drinking either tap water or water containing either the ACE-inhibitor enalapril (ena) or the calcium antagonist diltiazem (dil) or both (ena+dil) were formed. On the high-protein diet, an increase in the weight of kidney remnants, in proteinuria and in systolic blood pressure (SBP) was seen. This was prevented by feeding either type of the low-protein diet but also by ena and ena+dil. Ena and ena+dil not only prevented the increase in SBP but actually lowered it significantly. Dil alone also had a SBP-lowering action but offered no protection from kidney hypertrophy and it significantly. Dil alone also had a SBP-lowering action but offered no protection from kidney hypertrophy and proteinuria. No additive protective action of ena+dil or ena+low-protein or ena+dil+low-protein was seen suggesting that the lower limit of these protective actions was reached by the low-protein diet alone. There was no substantial difference between either type of low-protein diet except a small and transient decrease in body weight in the first week on a fat-rich diet.", 
    "481": "In the described experiments and with the set-up used the low-protein diet had no effect on the plasma creatinine and urea levels nor on creatinine clearance. The weight of the kidney remnants and proteinuria were significantly higher in animals on a high-protein diet who drank water or water with diltiazem. These changes were suppressed by administration of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors either alone or combined with diltiazem. A low- protein diet (both types tested) as well as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors improve the course of chronic renal failure in ablation nephropathy in the rat; the authors did not prove an additive effect of the combination of this diet with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "482": "We investigated the release of endothelin-1 (ET) from rat mesenteric arteries to clarify its pathophysiological role in the sustained hypertension of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) following nephrectomy and the regulatory mechanism of the ET release which might be modified by vascular angiotensins and bradykinins. Nephrectomy increased the plasma level of ET and enhanced the ET release in both SHR and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). CV-11974, an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, did not affect the ET release from arteries of nephrectomized rats. On the contrary, infusion of captopril, a converting enzyme inhibitor, further enhanced the ET release in both intact and nephrectomized rats. These findings suggest that the release of ET from mesenteric arteries may be regulated by bradykinins, but not by angiotensins. This pressor substance does not contribute to the sustained hypertension because the enhanced production of ET observed in both SHR and WKY. However, there is a possibility that the exaggerated responsiveness of vascular ET may in part account for local vascular tone and vascular remodeling in renal dysfunction.", 
    "483": "Bradykinin B2 receptor agonists, but not a B1 receptor agonist, were potent spasmogens of ferret isolated trachea. Bradykinin-induced contractions were unaffected by several pharmacological agents, indicating a direct effect on airway smooth muscle B2 receptors. Captopril plus thiorphan caused contractions in approximately 70% of preparations that were abolished by B2 receptor antagonists, but not by B1 receptor antagonist. Thus, ferret tracheal tissues appear capable of releasing and degrading kinins in vitro. Inhibition of peptide degradation with captopril and thiorphan may allow the endogenous kinins to accumulate in concentrations sufficient to elicit tracheal contraction via activation of B2 receptors.", 
    "484": "Enalapril is an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor with an established clinical profile. In patients with symptomatic heart failure, enalapril reduces overall mortality, death from progressive heart failure and hospitalisation rates. In those with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction, enalapril decreases the combined risk of death and development of heart failure, and the risk of death and hospitalisation. The effects of enalapril in reducing hospitalisation rates in symptomatic patients translate into net savings in healthcare costs in heart failure. Enalapril also produces modest benefits in quality-of-life (QOL) parameters in patients with symptomatic heart failure as shown in well controlled studies. Its effects appear similar to those of hydralazine plus isosorbide dinitrate. The influence of enalapril on quality of life in patients with asymptomatic disease is minimal but not deleterious. Enalapril generally either maintains or slightly improves quality of life from baseline in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. The drug appears to have a QOL profile that is more favourable than that of propranolol and similar to those of most other comparator drugs, as assessed by subjective measures of quality of life. Clarification is required of its QOL profile relative to that of captopril, in view of conflicting results in the literature. The effects of enalapril on cognitive and psychomotor function appear to resemble those of comparator agents. Thus, enalapril has modest beneficial effects on the quality of life of patients with symptomatic heart failure, while generally maintaining quality of life in patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction or mild to moderate hypertension. Enalapril is a cost-effective treatment in heart failure that would be expected to yield considerable cost savings in this therapeutic area.", 
    "485": "In the light of a case history, current treatment modalities for heart failure after acute myocardial infarction are described. Thrombolytics, beta-blocking agents and angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors have radically changed the prognosis of acute myocardial infarction. A decrease in cardiac mortality and a marked reduction in cases with severe heart failure have been achieved with optimal use of modern therapy. In cases without sufficient improvement by pharmacotherapy, combination with cardiac surgery may lead to a favourable result. Left ventricular aneurysmectomy is the procedure of choice for large ventricular aneurysms with heart failure symptoms.",

Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors were used in hypertensive glomerular disease, as well as with particular success in prevention and treatment of diabetic nephropathy. Malignant hypertension generally responds to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Guidelines for treatment of hypertension in chronic renal failure, and in end-stage-kidney disease patients on chronic dialysis or after kidney transplantation, with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are reviewed.",

We have launched five large scale multicenter cooperative studies, namely, Japan Multicenter Investigation for Cardiovascular Drugs/Therapies, J-MIC (I), (B), (M), (S), and (K). The aims of studies include to investigate: the best therapeutic approach in patients with acute myocardial infarction who underwent thrombolytic therapy with or without any adjunctive treatment (I), the long-term comparative study (3 years) of nifedipine (extended release tablet) with ACE inhibitor in patients with essential hypertension and ischemic heart disease (B), the long-term effect (3 years) of trapidil and/or ethyl icosapentate in patients with ischemic heart disease with or without arteriosclerotic obstructive disease in terms of progression or regression of atherosclerotic changes in coronary as well as peripheral arteries (M), the efficacy and safety of pravastatin to prevent post-PTCA restenosis (S), and regression of atherosclerotic lesion of coronary arteries in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia by LDL apheresis (K).",

    "489": "Creatinine clearance (CrCl), 24-hour urinary sodium excretion, fractional excretion of sodium, and urine flow were estimated in 68 non-azotemic uncomplicated cirrhosis patients; all these patients were followed up for a period of 6 months. Eighteen patients with ascites and edema were treated with large volume paracentesis without colloid replacement and renal function was evaluated before, and 48 hours and 7 days later. Eight patients with abnormal CrCl were treated with 10 mg of enalapril daily and CrCl estimated at the end of 7 days.", 
    "490": "Of 68 patients, 22 had CrCl > 80 mL/min (Group I), 21 had CrCl of 50-80 mL/min (Group II) and 25 had CrCl < 50 mL/min (Group III). Renal dysfunction correlated with Child's class. During a mean follow up period of 180 days, patients in Groups II and III had higher mortality rates than those in Group I (23.8% and 36.0% vs 9.1%; p < 0.001). Following large volume paracentesis, CrCl decreased at 48 h and continued to be low at the end of 7 days even though blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine remained normal. CrCl improved with 10 mg enalapril at 7 days (46.5 +/- 15.4 to 73.2 +/- 19.7 mL/min; p < 0.05).", 
    "491": "More than two-thirds of patients with advanced cirrhosis have abnormal CrCl despite normal blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine; they also have a higher mortality as compared with patients with normal CrCl. CrCl decreases after large volume paracentesis even though blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine remain unchanged. Enalapril improves CrCl in patients with liver cirrhosis but its exact clinical utility needs further evaluation.", 
    "492": "The antihypertensive mechanism of imidapril was investigated in relation to its inhibition of ACE activities in the serum, thoracic-abdominal aorta, lung, kidney, heart and brain from adult spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). In comparison with normotensive rats (NTRs), the ACE activities in the aorta, heart, brain and lung were higher, while those in the serum and kidney were considerably lower. Imidapril (2 mg/kg) showed remarkable inhibitions within 6 hr in all tissues, except for the brain, after a single oral administration. Consecutive administration of imidapril (2 mg/kg/day) for 30 days produced inhibitions in all tissues. The inhibitions in the serum, aorta and lung were greater, and the duration of inhibition in the aorta, brain and lung were longer. Blood pressure declined gradually until 6 hr, and the reductions were significant at 24 hr after the single and chronic administrations. Imidapril (0.5 mg/kg, ineffective on normal blood pressure) inhibited ACE activities in NTRs similarly. Enalapril at the same dose exhibited less ACE inhibition and antihypertension. These results suggest that the ACE inhibition in the serum, lung and aorta by imidapril correlate with the antihypertension in SHRs; especially, the lung and vascular ACE inhibitions play an important role in the duration of antihypertension in SHRs.", 
    "493": "The possibilities of applying the rotarod method in young rats for evaluating the antidepressive effect were studied. The results were compared with those obtained by the despair test, which was also used to evaluate the antidepressive effect. The rats used in these tests had not been trained previously. In the rotarod test, antidepressant drugs such as imipramine (30 mg/kg, p.o.), desipramine (10 mg/kg, p.o.), clorgyline (10 mg/kg, p.o.), mianserin (30 mg/kg, p.o.), trazodone (10 mg/kg, p.o.) and clomipramine (30 mg/kg, p.o.) and an ACE inhibitor, enalapril (30 mg/kg, p.o.), significantly prolonged the time rats were able to remain on the rotating rod in a dose-dependent manner. Diazepam significantly reduced the duration on the rotating rod. Theophylline, caffeine and fenfluramine did not affect the duration on the rotating rod. In the despair test (forced swimming test), clorgyline, enalapril and caffeine significantly reduced the duration of immobility during the forced swimming in a dose-dependent manner. Imipramine and desipramine significantly reduced the duration of immobility during forced swimming. Trazodone and clomipramine did not affect the duration of immobility. Diazepam significantly prolonged the duration of immobility. A highly significant correlation was noted between the results obtained by the rotarod method and those obtained by the despair test. In the traction test, theophylline and caffeine significantly prolonged the duration during the traction response. However, other drugs did not affect the duration during the traction response. These results demonstrate that the rotarod method in young rats may be applicable for evaluating the antidepressive effect.", 
    "494": "Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is a multifunctional cytokine and a major regulator of tissue repair and extracellular matrix. Recent studies show that TGF-beta overexpression in experimental and human kidney diseases leads to progressive glomerular and tubulointerstitial scarring and renal failure. New evidence suggests that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and a low-protein diet may slow the progression of chronic kidney diseases in part by suppressing TGF-beta overexpression. New therapies may prevent progressive fibrosis in chronic kidney disease by suppressing the action of TGF-beta.", 
    "495": "We studied the potential renoprotective properties of a calcium channel blocker in moderately hyperglycemic diabetic rats both in the early phase of the disease and in the very long term, and compared such an effect with that of an angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Three groups of diabetic rats, one receiving no therapy except insulin and the remaining two receiving insulin and the ACE inhibitor enalapril or the calcium blocker lacidipine and one group of nondiabetic control rats were followed for 4-6 weeks. Both antihypertensive drugs lowered systolic blood pressure comparably. At the end of the observation period, untreated diabetic rats exhibited elevation of glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow. Both enalapril and lacidipine treatment completely prevented whole-kidney hyperfiltration and hyperperfusion. Four additional groups of rats, similarly treated, were followed for 1 year. A comparable control of systolic blood pressure and blood glucose level was achieved with the two antihypertensive regimens throughout the whole study period. At 12 months, the average kidney weight was elevated to similar values in all diabetic groups relative to control rats. Untreated diabetic rats had progressive proteinuria and developed glomerulosclerosis. Enalapril markedly limited the development of proteinuria. By contrast, urinary protein excretion in diabetic rats given lacidipine markedly increased with time, and values were as high as those in untreated diabetic animals. Similarly, only enalapril was effective in limiting glomerular injury. These results indicate that ACE inhibition but not calcium channel blockade has a favorable effect in preventing renal disease progression in diabetic rats and suggest that the various antihypertensive regimens are not equally beneficial in protecting against diabetic glomerulopathy.",

Incremental daily doses of 25 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg captopril used for a four week period each for a total of 12 weeks preceded by a two week placebo washout. Twenty eight ambulatory patients (mean age 72) New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II or III with apparently controlled ischaemic dilated heart failure (ejection fraction 29% (0.04%)) on digoxin, diuretics, and nitrates were randomised. All had at least grade 2/4 functional mitral regurgitation (> 5 cm2 regurgitant area on colour flow Doppler).", 
    "498": "Twenty three patients completed the study (13 on placebo and 10 on captopril). Significant improvements were confined to the captopril group. Compared with placebo the following improvements were noted in the captopril treated group: mitral regurgitant area decreased from a threshold at 50 mg/day (p < 0.05, mean (95% confidence interval (95% CI)) 3.1 (0.2 to 6.0) cm2), with a further decrease at 100 mg/day (p < 0.01, mean (95% CI) 5.3 (3.1 to 7.5) cm2). Significant improvements in all the other measurements were noted only after 100 mg/day. Stroke volume increased (p < 0.01, mean (95% CI) 11, (1.4 to 21) ml), systemic vascular resistance decreased (p < 0.05, mean (95% CI) 414 (35 to 793) dyn s cm5), left atrial area decreased (p < 0.05, mean (95% CI) 4.3 (0.03 to 8.6) cm2), and deceleration time increased (p < 0.01, mean (95% CI) 52 ms (7 to 98) ms). Left ventricular diameter decreased marginally (p = 0.06, mean (95% CI) 4 (-0.05 to 9 mm). Duke activity index score increased (p < 0.001, median (95% CI) 6.8 (4.5 to 12) points). Heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, serum creatinine, and serum potassium did not change with either placebo or captopril. No patient was withdrawn directly due to the side effects of captopril. In an open phase nine placebo patients given captopril in rapid increments reaching 100 mg/day in the fourth week showed similar improvements.",

    "500": "The prevailing theory of sodium depletion-induced salt appetite states that angiotensin (ANG) of cerebral origin, not of renal origin, causes the behavior. This assertion depends partly on an experiment that suppressed salt appetite using an intravenous infusion of a dose of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (captopril, 2.5 mg/h) that supposedly blocked both central and peripheral enzyme (17). The present experiments used the same dose of captopril to suppress salt appetite both in 24-h and in 3-h models of sodium depletion-induced behavior. The captopril-infused rats 1) increased water intake normally after central injections of ANG I given immediately after each salt appetite test, 2) had no arterial pressor response after intravenously injected ANG I, and 3) had normal arterial pressor responses after either intravenously injected ANG II or centrally injected ANG I. Thus, although the peripheral ACE was completely blocked in captopril-infused rats, the central ACE was not, because the central thirst and arterial pressor responses to ANG I were indistinguishable from controls. This demonstrates that ANG of renal origin is necessary for the expression of sodium depletion-induced salt appetite.", 
    "501": "Age-related changes in endothelial (E) function were studied in mesenteric arterial bed (MAB) preparations removed from male, normotensive, WAG/Rij rats. At the age of 6 mo, one-half of the animals was assigned to chronic treatment with a hypotensive dose of an angiotensin I (ANG I)-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI; perindopril, 1 mg.kg-1.day-1 po). Animals were killed at 6, 12, 24, or 30 mo of age; the MAB was perfused in vitro, perfusion pressure (PP) being taken as an index of arteriolar tone. Disruption of E function produced a fall in baseline PP in all groups except 30-mo-old rats, suggesting that 1) baseline tone is maintained by the release of E vasoconstrictor factor(s) and 2) this mechanism is impaired in 30-mo-old rats. The muscarinic agonist, carbachol, antagonized vasoconstriction produced by norepinephrine (NE) in the presence of E. This mechanism was impaired in 30-mo-old rats. NE vasoconstriction increased following disruption of E, suggesting that NE release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor attenuates vasoconstriction. This mechanism was impaired in 30-mo-old rats. Chronic ACEI postponed the age-related decrease in E function, possibly due to a direct effect, or an indirect effect via the prolonged hypotensive action of such treatment.", 
    "502": "The consequences of hypertension and aging on cardiovascular structure and function are reputed to be similar, suggesting that blood pressure plays a role in the aging process. However, the exact relationship between aging, blood pressure, and the arterial structure-function relationship has not been demonstrated. To test the effects of aging, renin-angiotensin system, and pressure on the arterial wall, 20 normotensive male WAG/Rij rats were killed at 6, 12, 24, and 30 mo of age and compared with similar groups treated with an angiotensin (ANG)-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), perindopril. Arterial function was determined by a systemic hemodynamic study and by in situ measurement of carotid compliance. Arterial wall structure was determined by histomorphometric and biochemical methods. Aging did not significantly modify blood pressure, but ACE inhibition decreased blood pressure significantly from 6 to 30 mo. Plasma renin activity decreased with age and increased with ACEI. Plasma atrial natriuretic factor increased with age and was significantly decreased with ACEI. Absolute and relative left ventricular weight increased with age, and ACEI delayed these increases. Arterial wall stiffness increased with age, as shown by a significant decrease in systemic and local arterial compliance and by an increase in aortic characteristic impedance. The increase in carotid wall compliance after poisoning of smooth muscle contractile function (KCN) was greater in young (6- and 12-mo old) than in old (24- and 30-mo old) rats. Chronic ACEI treatment increased basal carotid compliance values slightly and did not change KCN carotid compliance. The aortic and carotid luminal size increased regularly with age. Aging was associated without any change in absolute elastin content. In contrast, collagen content increased with aging. Aging was also associated with an increase in medial thickness. Medial thickening was mainly due to smooth muscle hypertrophy. Aging was associated with intimal proliferation, which became progressively thicker and collagen rich. ACEI treatment did not prevent aortic lumen enlargement but significantly postponed the increase in medial and intimal thickening. Biochemical determinations of the aortic wall components confirmed the morphometric data. In conclusion, the age-dependent large artery enlargement and stiffening were observed both in normotensive rats and in those rats whose blood pressure was lowered by ACEI. This suggests that aging and blood pressure affect arterial wall structure and function by different mechanisms.", 
    "503": "Normal aging is accompanied by renal functional and structural deterioration. To examine the hemodynamic and growth-related mechanisms of age-associated nephron loss, as well as the potential beneficial effects of antihypertensive therapy, studies were performed in normal aging Munich-Wistar rats, and in rats receiving long-term antihypertensive therapy with the converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI) enalapril. In protocol 1, rats were treated from the age of 3 mo. Compared with young rats, untreated old rats studied at 2.5 yr of age exhibited normal blood pressure but increased glomerular capillary pressure due to a reduction in afferent arteriolar resistance. Glomerular size increased proportionately to changes in body weight, while kidney weight increased to a lesser degree. Albuminuria rose significantly after 10 mo of age and was accompanied by development of modest, but significant, glomerular sclerosis. CEI therapy from the age of 3 mo lowered systemic and glomerular capillary pressures, did not affect glomerular size, and significantly ameliorated development of albuminuria and structural injury. In protocol 2, untreated rats were compared with a treated group in which enalapril therapy was delayed until the age of 1 yr, when albuminuria was already rising. Subsequent increases in albuminuria and development of sclerosis were significantly attenuated, although not entirely prevented. These findings suggest that hemodynamic maladaptations may contribute to age-related loss of renal function in the rat and that antihypertensive therapy may serve to delay this process.",

    "510": "Anaesthetists will encounter increasing numbers of patients who are receiving long-term treatment with ACE inhibitors for hypertension, congestive heart failure and prophylactically following myocardial infarction. Our understanding of the physiology and pharmacology of the renin-angiotensin system has dramatically increased in the last decade, and has led to the discovery of endogenous renin-angiotensin systems which may be physiologically more important than the better understood circulating system. There are several reports of adverse interactions between anaesthesia and ACE inhibitors, manifested as hypotension and bradycardia, which may be delayed until the postoperative period. The mechanism behind them is not understood and, as yet, no published studies have attempted to address this issue. It is possible, however, that dehydration associated with the pre-operative fast may play an important role. ACE inhibitors may, in the future, prove to be useful in the subspecialties of cardiac and vascular anaesthesia, where they might be used in an attempt to preserve cardiac function following periods of ischaemia and cardiopulmonary bypass, and to avoid renal damage following aortic cross-clamping. Meanwhile, it would seem prudent to exercise caution when anaesthetising patients taking ACE inhibitors and to be fully prepared to treat the hypotension and bradycardia which may occur.", 
    "511": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition could ameliorate renal ischemic injury. Both a chronic rat model and a rat isolated perfused kidney (IPK) model were used. Adult rats were subjected to 60 min of left hilar crossclamping and right nephrectomy. Captopril (1 mg/kg) was given intravenously 5-10 min prior to clamping (CAP-pre, n = 5), at reperfusion (CAP-post, n = 5), or 30 min after reperfusion (CAP-30 min post, n = 5). Other groups of rats received enalapril (0.8 mg/kg iv) in the same manner (ENAL-pre, n = 5; ENAL-post, n = 5; ENAL-30 min post, n = 4). Serum creatinine in the treated groups was compared to ischemic control (NS, n = 7) for 7 days. In the IPK experiments, kidneys were similarly treated with CAP or ENAL. Vascular resistance (VR) and oxygen consumption (O2 CON) were determined from pressure, flow, and oxygen tension data for 60 min after initial equilibration. In the chronic model, Day 2 serum creatinine was significantly lower in all treated groups vs ischemic control. By Day 7, serum creatinine remained significantly lower in all ENAL-treated groups and in the CAP-30 min post group, although other CAP-treated groups had appreciably, although not significantly, lower creatinines, too. Histologic examination of CAP-pre kidney revealed intact morphology compared to ischemic control where acute tubular necrosis was observed. In the IPK experiments, CAP- and ENAL-treated kidneys had VR values that were significantly lower than those of ischemic controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "512": "The present study was undertaken to assess the presence of renin enzymatic activity and renin mRNA in proximal tubules of rat kidneys, and to determine the effect of converting enzyme inhibition (CEI) on proximal tubule renin gene expression. Proximal convoluted tubules (PCT), proximal straight tubules (PST), outer medullary collecting ducts (OMCD), and glomeruli (Gloms) were isolated by microdissection. Renin activity was measured in sonicated segments by radioimmunoassay. Renin mRNA levels were assessed using a quantitative PCR. Renin activity in PCT averaged 51 +/- 15 microGU/mm compared to 405 +/- 120 microGU/glomerulus. No measurable renin activity was found in PST and OMCD. Renin activity in both glomeruli and tubules had the same pH optimum, between 7.0 and 7.5. Renin mRNA was consistently detectable in cDNA prepared from PCT and PST, although its abundance per mm tubule was about 1/500th that found in one glomerulus. Renin mRNA was not detectable in OMCD. Tubular renin PCR product identity was confirmed by restriction digestion. CEI administration increased glomerular renin activity and renin mRNA, but not proximal tubular renin. The absence of a stimulatory effect of CEI on proximal tubule renin gene expression suggests the operation of different intracellular signals in control of renin synthesis in the proximal tubule than in the vascular compartment.", 
    "513": "The aim of the study was to compare, in a rat model of congestive heart failure, the effect of captopril, a selective angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE; EC 3.4.15.1) inhibitor, to that of alatriopril, a mixed inhibitor of ACE and atriopeptidase (EC 3.4.24.11), an enzyme implicated in the degradation of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF). Myocardial infarction was induced by ligation of the left coronary artery. Groups of rats received orally twice daily captopril (10 mg/kg), alatriopril (100 mg/kg) or vehicle. Treatments were started 18 to 20 h after ligation and continued for 4 weeks. Hypertrophic and hormonal changes reflecting congestive heart failure were assessed in rats with large infarcts by measuring the relative weight of cardiac tissues as well as by assaying ANF in heart and plasma and by measuring renin activity in plasma. Both treatments significantly reduced cardiac hypertrophy, but alatriopril showed a greater efficacy than captopril--the increase in relative heart weight reaching 38% with captopril and only 22% with alatriopril (P < .05). The hypertrophy of right ventricle was reduced by 47% with alatriopril and by 35% with captopril (N.S.), whereas the corresponding reductions for atria were 47% vs. 21% (P < .05). Both treatments prevented the ligation-induced increase of ANF level in the right ventricle. In contrast, plasma ANF level was significantly reduced after captopril but not after alatriopril treatment, a difference that probably reflects the protection of endogenous ANF in circulation resulting from atriopeptidase inhibition. Plasma renin was increased by 36-fold after captopril but only by 1.6-fold after alatriopril, a difference that presumably reflects the inhibition of renal renin secretion by endogenous ANF after alatriopril. These data suggest that enhancement of ANF levels in circulation via atriopeptidase inhibition magnifies the capacity of ACE inhibitors to prevent cardiac hypertrophy, and they show the potential therapeutic value of mixed ACE-atriopeptidase inhibitors in congestive heart failure.", 
    "514": "We developed a method of measuring the mole quantity of pulmonary angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) bound by a partially saturating dose of an ACE inhibitor injected i.v. For each test animal (11 guinea pigs), tracer (nonsaturating) doses of the ACE substrate [14C]benzoyl-Ala-Gly-Pro (14C-BAGP) and the ACE inhibitor 3H-RAC-X-65 were coinjected at timed intervals for a total of four studies per animal. The injectate used for the second study contained, in addition, a partially saturating dose of unlabeled RAC-X-65. With indicator-dilution techniques supplemented with measurements of fractional hydrolysis of 14CBAGP and uptake of 3H-RAC-X-65 during a single transit through the pulmonary vascular bed, the following parameters were computed: plasma flow (Qp), (kcat/Km)[E] vector c, k1[E] vector c and Eb, where [E] is the concentration of active ACE, Eb is the mole quantity of ACE bound by inhibitor, kcat/Km is the second-order rate constant for substrate hydrolysis, k1 is the inhibitor-ACE association rate constant and vector c is capillary mean transit time. As shown elsewhere (Catravas et al., 1990; Catravas and White, 1984), the product of Qp (in liters per second) multiplied by (kcat/Km)[E] vector c is (kcat/Km)E, and the product of Qp multiplied by k1[E] vector c is k1E, where E is the mole quantity of ACE. Values of (kcat/Km)Eb and k1Eb were computed and divided by Eb to obtain kcat/Km and k1. The fractional degree of inhibition conferred by a partially saturating dose of an ACE inhibitor can be understood to be the ratio Eb/ET, where ET is total ACE. With Eb in moles and the ratio Eb/ET, we computed the mole quantity of ET. By measuring the rate of recovery of ACE activity following partial inhibition of ACE, an apparent dissociation rate constant, k(dissoc), was computed. With k(dissoc) and K1, an apparent Ki was computed. The following computations were obtaine: ET of 0.90 +/- 0.20 (S.E.M.) nmol; kcat/Km, 5.16 +/- 0.89E + 06 M-1.sec-1; k1, 1.26 +/- 0.21E + 06 M-1.sec-1; k(dissoc), 6.47 +/- 0.63E - 04 sec-1 and Ki, 5.13E - 10 M. Although we focused on the characterization of ACE, the methods developed are general and may be applicable to studies of other vascular surface proteins, including other enzymes and hormone receptors.", 
    "515": "The renin-angiotensin axis has recently been called the source of disproportionate splanchnic vasoconstriction during shock, and blocking this axis decreased gastric stress ulceration during swine cardiogenic shock. The present study tested whether the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril would prevent stress ulceration when given after the onset of canine hemorrhagic shock, and whether any detrimental effects would result from enhancing splanchnic perfusion with captopril during hemorrhagic shock. We found that captopril treatment was associated with a decrease in gastric mucosal injury and with a marked decrease in systemic acidosis. Captopril enhanced blood flow to the small intestine, pancreas, liver, and spleen, but not flow to the stomach, during shock. Following the reinfusion of shed blood, the captopril-treated animals had decreased mean blood pressures and increased heart rates compared with untreated animals. We found captopril alleviated the stress ulceration produced by canine hemorrhagic shock, but concluded that the likely mechanism was alleviating systemic acidosis through enhanced perfusion of other viscera rather than a specific enhancement of gastric perfusion.", 
    "516": "The role of nonhemodynamic cardiac trophic mechanisms differs not only between different models of cardiac hypertrophy but also within the same model for development versus maintenance of cardiac hypertrophy. Our previous studies pointed to a major role for the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) as a cardiac trophic stimulus in the remodeling of the heart in response to volume overload by aortocaval shunt or minoxidil treatment.", 
    "517": "In the present study, we evaluated the effects of blockade of the RAS by the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril and the angiotensin II receptor blocker losartan on left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular mass and LV dilation in relation to changes in central hemodynamics during the maintenance of minoxidil and aortocaval shunt-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Both blockers similarly decreased LV end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and LV peak systolic pressure, whereas cardiac output remained unchanged in both models of volume overload. This suggests a major contribution of improved LV performance and decreased afterload to the decrease in cardiac preload by the two blockers rather than decreased venous return. Both blockers reversed LV hypertrophy in parallel to their effects on LVEDP in both models of volume overload. In minoxidil-treated rats, the extent of reversal in LV mass and dilation by the two blockers was similar to \"spontaneous regression\" after discontinuation of minoxidil treatment.", 
    "518": "These results indicate that in contrast to the development phase of cardiac hypertrophy, the RAS does not contribute to the maintenance of volume overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy in these two models via direct cardiac trophic effects. The RAS, however, maintains cardiac hypertrophy indirectly by contributing to the persistence of high filling pressures.", 
    "519": "The role of angiotensin as a vasoconstrictor is well established. Lately, several other actions of this hormone on vascular smooth muscle (VSM) cells have been recognized including the induction of hypertrophy and/or DNA synthesis. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), a mitogen recently shown to increase plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) synthesis in VSM cells, shares with angiotensin II (Ang II) several steps of its intracellular signaling pathway.", 
    "520": "The expression of PAI-1 and tissue-type plasminogen activator (TPA) mRNA in cultured rat VSM cells was studied. Northern blot analysis demonstrated a severalfold increase in the PAI-1 mRNA 3 to 8 hours after stimulation with 300 nmol/L Ang II. A similar response for TPA mRNA was observed. This induction did not require the synthesis of an intermediate protein or peptide because it was not affected by cycloheximide. In the cell-conditioned supernatant, the net result was an increase in PAI-1 activity from 4.18 +/- 1.8 to 13.2 +/- 6.8 IU/mL 6 hours after the addition of 300 nmol/L Ang II (mean +/- SD, P < or = .008, n = 6). The Ang II-induced increase in PAI activity was dose related, with a maximal effect at a concentration of 23 nmol/L (n = 3) and an ED50 of 3.3 +/- 1.5 nmol/L (n = 3). [Sar1-Ile8]angiotensin II, a specific competitive antagonist of Ang II, blocked 90 +/- 9% (n = 3) of the PAI activity induced by 10 nmol/L Ang II. In basal conditions, fibrin overlay zymography demonstrated the presence of free TPA. After stimulation with Ang II, lysis caused by the in situ dissociation of TPA was also present in the region of the TPA/PAI-1 complex. Angiotensin I (Ang I) elicited an increase in PAI activity similar to that obtained with equivalent doses of Ang II. Captopril (5 micrograms/mL), an inhibitor of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), completely prevented the Ang I effect, demonstrating that VSM cells display an ACE-like activity.", 
    "521": "Recent research has demonstrated the existence of a localized vascular renin-angiotensin system. The finding that Ang II can potentially modulate the plasminogen activation in the arterial wall has important biological and therapeutical implications for the evolution of arterial wall thrombi and the migration of cells through the vessel wall in the genesis of atherosclerotic lesions. We speculate that the reduction in thrombotic events observed in patients with a previous myocardial infarction and in high-renin, hypertensive patients treated with ACE inhibitors could be due at least in part to the decreased production of PAI-1 by VSM cells caused by these agents.", 
    "522": "Contrary to expectation, most studies have demonstrated that initiation of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor in conventional doses in patients with heart failure reduces the diuretic efficacy of furosemide. Recently, it has been suggested that single low doses (1 mg) but not high doses (25 mg) of captopril enhance furosemide-induced diuresis. It is not known whether the interaction between diuretics and ACE inhibitors are altered during long-term dosing.", 
    "523": "Eight patients with heart failure treated with diuretics and ACE inhibitors for at least 3 months were studied. All patients were established on captopril 12.5 mg three times daily for 2 weeks before the study. Sodium intake was fixed before the study, and usual medication was withheld on study days. Intravenous furosemide was given on each of 2 study days to maintain a moderate, constant diuresis. Renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were determined using clearance techniques, and urine was collected hourly over 4 hours. Captopril 12.5 mg or placebo was given in a randomized, single-blind fashion at the end of the first hour. Compared with placebo, captopril reduced plasma concentrations of angiotensin II (23 +/- 18 versus 4 +/- 3 pg/ml 1 hour after dosing, P < .02) and systolic (131 +/- 31 versus 122 +/- 29 mm Hg, P < .01) and diastolic (74 +/- 15 versus 67 +/- 13 mm Hg, P < .05) blood pressures. GFR fell (55 +/- 24 versus 51 +/- 22 mL/min, P < .02) and effective renal plasma flow rose during the first (198 +/- 76 versus 231 +/- 49 mL/min) and second hours after dosing (185 +/- 69 versus 247 +/- 74 mL/min, P < .02). Similarly, urine volumes, in response to furosemide, increased after captopril (238 +/- 90 versus 283 +/- 111 mL, P < .05, and 245 +/- 78 versus 311 +/- 92 mL, P < .01, 1 and 2 hours after dosing). Urinary electrolyte concentrations fell, but total urinary sodium (22 +/- 7 versus 28 +/- 12 mmol/hr, P < .01) and chloride (20 +/- 6 versus 25 +/- 11 mmol/hr, P < .05) excretion increased in the 2 hours after dosing, as did fractional excretion of sodium (urinary sodium/urinary creatinine) (61 +/- 27 versus 75 +/- 36 mmol/mumol, P < .01).",

After baseline examination between 48 and 72 hours after symptom onset, patients were randomly assigned to placebo or captopril administration, and on the third day, 24-hour Holter monitoring was repeated. No changes in time and frequency domain were detectable after placebo. After captopril, the SD of all normal RR (NN) intervals (SDNN) increased from 90 +/- 29 to 105 +/- 30 milliseconds (P < .01); the SD of the average NN intervals for all 5-minute segments (SDANN index) and the mean of the SDs of all NN intervals for all 5-minute segments (SDNN index) also increased from 74 +/- 24 to 90 +/- 26 milliseconds (P < .01) and from 45 +/- 17 to 49 +/- 15 milliseconds (P < .05), respectively. The root mean square successive difference (r-MSSD) and the percent of differences between adjacent NN intervals > 50 milliseconds (pNN50) remained unchanged. In regard to frequency-domain measures, after captopril, total power (ln unit) increased from 8.28 +/- 0.42 to 8.47 +/- 0.30 (P < .01); considering the frequency bands, a significant increase was observed in ULF (P < .01), VLF (P < .05), and low-frequency (LF) power (P < .05), whereas high-frequency (HF) power remained unchanged.",

    "529": "The effects of captopril were evaluated in 58 patients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction after MI. Patients were randomized on day 7 to either placebo or captopril (50 mg daily) in a double-blind parallel study over a period of 6 months. Patients were followed up by means of ambulatory ECG monitoring and echocardiography. There was a significant increase in VA in the placebo group (P < .05) in contrast to a significant decrease in the captopril group (P < .05). As a consequence, there was a significant between-group difference after 6 months (P < .05). Furthermore, the number of patients without VA at baseline who presented with this at the completion of the study was 6% in the captopril group versus 38% in the placebo group (P < .05). At baseline as well as at the termination of the study, LV end-diastolic volume index (LVEDVI) and LV end-systolic volume index (LVESVI) were significantly increased among patients with VA (P < .01). On day 180, both myocardial ischemia and an increase in the LVEDVI were independent predictors of VA; however, progressive dilation of the left ventricle was confined to the placebo patients with significant increases in the LVEDVI compared with the captopril group: 17% versus 0%, respectively (P < .01). Furthermore, the duration of ambulatory ST-segment depression was significantly longer in this group compared with the captopril group (P < .01).",

In post-MI patients with LV dysfunction, captopril has a beneficial effect on both the number of complex VAs as well as the number of patients who develop VA during the chronic phase. This is in all probability mediated through effects on both LV remodeling, LV function, and myocardial ischemia in patients who are exposed to an increased risk of undergoing progressive dilation of the left ventricle.",

Extremely high levels of active renin and, to a greater extent, of prorenin were found in plasma and tumor tissue. Immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization studies demonstrated that the neoplastic cells were the source of renin production. The hyponatremic hypertensive syndrome and proteinuria promptly responded to treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, suggesting an angiotensin II dependency of these disorders. After removal of the leiomyosarcoma, plasma concentration of active renin, but not of prorenin, normalized and the hypertension, proteinuria, and electrolyte abnormalities disappeared. However, 5 months after operation, the patient presented once again with hypertension, hypokalemia, proteinuria, and markedly increased plasma levels of both active renin and prorenin that heralded the relapse of neoplastic disease.",

Defined as a persistently elevated hematocrit (> 0.51), it occurs most commonly during the first 2 years posttransplant in hypertensive males with excellent allograft function. Its consequences are disputed, but may include increased risk of thromboembolic events. Traditionally, PTE has been thought to reflect excess erythropoietin production, of either native kidney or allograft origin, and to abate spontaneously with time. More recent data indicate that factors other than erythropoietin may be involved in the pathogenesis of PTE and that spontaneous resolution is relatively uncommon. Standard treatments have included serial phlebotomy and native kidney nephrectomy. It now appears that PTE also can be managed safely and effectively with converting enzyme inhibitors, a development that challenges our previous understanding of PTE and offers new avenues for investigating its pathogenesis.",

We used intravital microscopy in an original preparation of cremaster isolated from its normal blood supply and externally perfused with physiological solution, thus allowing the exclusion of circulating converting enzyme, circulating renin, and circulating angiotensinogen. We classified arterioles studied as second-, third-, and fourth-order, with mean diameters, respectively, of 67 +/- 6, 35 +/- 2, and 17 +/- 1 microns in WKY controls and 61 +/- 5, 34 +/- 2, and 16 +/- 1 microns in SHR. No difference between WKY controls and SHR was found for arteriolar vasoconstrictions in response to topical administration of 0.01 to 1 nmol/mL angiotensin II. Conversely, in response to 0.01 to 1 nmol/mL angiotensin I, significantly more arteriolar vasoconstriction was found in SHR cremaster muscle. In both strains, responses to angiotensin I were significantly inhibited by 10 nmol/mL of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril. When angiotensinogen-rich, renin-free plasma containing 2.3 nmol/mL angiotensinogen was administered, almost no vasoconstriction was found in WKY controls, but significant constrictions were observed in SHR (23 +/- 4%, 30 +/- 5%, and 41 +/- 4% for second-, third-, and fourth-order arterioles, respectively). In SHR, vasoconstriction in response to angiotensinogen-rich, renin-free plasma was dose dependent, was inhibited by lisinopril, and was not found 24 hours after bilateral nephrectomy.

We orally administered TCV-116 (Ang II type 1 receptor antagonist) and delapril (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor) to Wistar rats for 1 week and measured the immunoreactive cardiac Ang II. Immunoreactive cardiac Ang II (pg/gm tissue) was 14.3 +/- 2.0 in control group, 11.8 +/- 0.8 in TCV-116-treated group, and 7.3 +/- 0.6 in delapril-treated group (p < 0.05 compared to TCV-116-treated group; p < 0.01 compared to control group). The 15 hearts (five rats in each group) were perfused by a langendorff method and global ischemia was maintained for 30 min. Both TCV-116 and delapril were found to improve postischemic cardiac function and decrease reperfusion creatine kinase (CK) release. Ang II injection before ischemia worsened postischemic cardiac function and increased reperfusion CK release. Only TCV-116 prevented this injury. These data indicated that TCV-116 Ang II type 1 receptor antagonist was effective against myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury, and exogenous Ang II accelerated this injury through Ang II type 1 receptor.",

Stretching and thinning of the myocardium within the infarct region can be seen within hours after the acute event and may be accompanied by delayed but potentially progressive stretching and thinning in the noninfarct regions. Development of left ventricular hypertrophy in the nonischemic myocardium, in response to increased wall stress, can be observed but may be insufficient for proper compensation. This process is referred to as postinfarction remodeling and can result in progressive and long-term changes in ventricular architecture and function in the absence of additional ischemic injury.",

In addition to traditional post-infarction medications such as beta-blockers, nitrates, and aspirin, long-term benefit may be derived by use of adjunctive pharmacologic therapy such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, which have been shown to be valuable in limiting the extent of ventricular chamber dilatation after infarction. Studies in animal models and conclusions from clinical trials have shown that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors also decrease late mortality and cardiac morbidity after infarction, likely through favorable effects on both hemodynamic and neurohumoral factors specific to this class of medication.",

    "540": "To assess the mechanism behind a possible atherosclerosis-promoting effect of angiotensin II, the influence of angiotensin II, noradrenaline, and enalapril on transfer of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) into the arterial wall was investigated in conscious rabbits. Intravascular infusion of angiotensin II (1.4 micrograms/kg per minute) initially increased the mean blood pressure from 70 to 80 mm Hg to 125 to 150 mm Hg; this effect was transient, and the blood pressure returned to baseline values within 2 hours, despite continuous infusion of angiotensin II. The normalized influx of LDL into the aortic intima, determined after in vivo exposure to 125I-LDL for 1 hour, was 88 +/- 17 (n = 6), 12 +/- 12 (n = 5), and 28 +/- 6 (n = 5) nL/cm2 per hour (mean +/- SEM) during angiotensin II infusion at high blood pressure, during angiotensin II infusion after the blood pressure had been normalized, and during continuous saline infusions, respectively (P < .05 for high blood pressure versus low blood pressure and saline). When noradrenaline was used to increase blood pressure to a level similar to that induced by angiotensin II, the normalized influx of LDL in noradrenaline-treated rabbits was also increased markedly. Production of endogenous angiotensin II was inhibited with enalapril (2.9 mg/kg per day). Compared with placebo rabbits, enalapril-treated rabbits had a 92% lower plasma angiotensin-converting enzyme activity and a 23% lower blood pressure.

ET production in the culture medium was measured by radioimmunoassay. BAECs spontaneously produced ET in a time-dependent manner for 4 to 24 h after incubation. Addition of tuna AI to the medium resulted in a time- and concentration-dependent decrease in the production of ET. The tuna AI-induced inhibition of ET production was blocked by B-3824 (bradykinin (BK) B2-receptor antagonist), NG-monomethyl-L-Arg and indomethacin, but not by angiotensin II receptor antagonist. While BK, sodium nitroprusside and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) significantly inhibited ET production, angiotensin II and interleukin-1 did not. Potent ACE inhibitory peptides among tuna AI analogues did not always inhibit ET production. The results suggest that tuna AI inhibits ET production at least in part via potentiation of PDGF expression in addition to potentiation of BK pathway.",

Hepatocyte growth factor is a multifunctional polypeptide which acts as mitogen, motogen or morphogen depending on the biological context. Recently, we found that HGF stimulates hair follicle growth in a mouse organ culture system, and therefore proceeded to investigate the expression of HGF on cultured human dermal papilla cells (DPC) and the effect of HGF on cultured human keratinocytes derived from hair bulb. Using an enzyme immuno assay, HGF immunoreactivities were not detected in conditioned media of DPC that were either non-treated or treated with TGF-beta, but were detected in conditioned media of DPC treated with IL1-alpha, TNF-alpha and TPA. Using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method, HGF mRNA was also detected in DPC. This expression was enhanced by IL1-alpha, TNF-alpha and TPA, but suppressed by TGF-beta. Furthermore, HGF stimulated the DNA synthesis in keratinocytes derived from human hair bulb in a dose-dependent manner. These results indicate that DPC express HGF in vitro and that HGF stimulates the growth of human keratinocytes derived from hair bulb in vitro.",

Ang II was determined by radioimmunoassay coupled with high performance liquid chromatography. Nephrectomy caused a decrease of plasma renin activity and plasma Ang II concentration in both SHR and WKY. Aortic Ang II levels were significantly lowered by nephrectomy only in WKY, and not in SHR. Ang II levels in hypothalamic block, brainstem and cerebellum of SHR increased after nephrectomy, whereas those of WKY were unchanged. Intracerebroventricular administration of ceronapril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, significantly decreased sustained high blood pressure in SHR 48 h after nephrectomy compared with vehicle administration, whereas intravenous administration had no effect. These results suggest that in spite of the important role of the renal renin-angiotensin system in maintenance of high blood pressure in SHR, control mechanisms may switch to other systems after nephrectomy, and that the increased brain Ang II levels after nephrectomy may be related to these mechanisms.", 
    "549": "Aspirin at low doses is used as an inhibitor of platelet aggregation and is frequently administered to essential hypertensive patients with arterial thrombotic complications. However, it is unknown whether aspirin can modify blood pressure values either in treated or untreated hypertensive patients, as described for other non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Thus 30 patients. 10 with mild uncomplicated and untreated essential hypertension, 10 with essential hypertension under chronic treatment with captopril, 50 mg bid, and 10 with essential hypertension under chronic treatment with atenolol, 100 mg oid, received aspirin, 100 mg oid, and the corresponding placebo for one month, according to a double blind randomized cross-over design. At the end of each treatment, blood pressure, heart rate, generated serum thromboxane B2 and urinary excretion of thromboxane B2 and 6 keto prostaglandin F1 alpha and plasma renin activity were measured. Both in treated and untreated essential hypertensive patients, aspirin administration did not affect blood pressure, heart rate and urinary 6 keto prostaglandin F1 alpha, while it significantly reduced serum and urinary excretion of thromboxane B2 and plasma renin activity. In conclusion, while the present data confirm that low doses of aspirin selectively inhibit thromboxane B2 synthesis, they indicate that aspirin at 100 mg oid can be administered to treated and untreated essential hypertensive patients without any harmful effect on blood pressure values.",

To test the hypothesis that a central mechanism may play a role in the minimal reflex tachycardia noted in response to peripheral converting enzyme inhibition, we compared the effects of intravenous (i.v.) ceronapril (CER) with nitroglycerin (NTG) on neurotransmitter release in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM), using an in vivo microdialysis method in pentobarbital anaesthetized rats. 2. CER (0.1 mg/kg, i.v.) caused a progressive decrease in glutamate (GLU) release (CER 65 +/- 7% vs NTG 83 +/- 3% of each baseline at 140 min, P < 0.05) and attenuated the increase in glycine (GLY) release (CER 100 +/- 8% vs NTG 122 +/- 9%, P < 0.05). 3. Prevention of blood pressure reduction due to i.v. CER by concomitant infusion of a subpressor dose of angiotensin II (AII) attenuated the progressive reduction of GLU release (87 +/- 4%, P < 0.05 compared with NTG group), whereas GLY release was not affected (106 +/- 5%, NS compared with NTG group). 4. Perfusion of GLU into this area at approximately physiological concentrations resulted in a sustained tachycardia with an attenuation of the depressor effect of i.v. CER and perfusion of GLY solely lowered blood pressure. 5. These results demonstrate that i.v. converting enzyme inhibitor reduces the release of GLU in the RVLM, which was specifically caused by reducing circulating AII, without any effect on GLY release, thus resulting in the reduction of blood pressure with minimal effect on the heart rate.",

    "552": "The effect of two angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on the development of atherosclerosis was determined in hyperlipidemic hamsters. Preliminary studies indicated that only fosinopril (50 mg/kg) temporarily decreased mean arterial pressure, while after chronic dosing fosinopril and captopril (50 mg/kg) were ineffective. The same dose of fosinopril and captopril inhibited the angiotensin I pressor response, indicating these agents suppressed ACE activity in vivo. In the 3 week atherosclerosis experiment, all hamsters were fed chow supplemented with 0.05% cholesterol and 10% coconut oil. Control hamsters were compared with those receiving either 50 mg/kg per day of fosinopril or 50 mg/kg per day of captopril. After 3 weeks, fosinopril reduced plasma total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL) plus very low density lipoprotein cholesterol and total triglycerides by 17%, 27% and 45%, respectively. Captopril only reduced high density lipoprotein cholesterol by 20%. Neither fosinopril or captopril altered blood pressure at 3 weeks. Atherosclerosis was quantified from en face preparations of the lesion-prone aortic arch that were stained with oil red O (for cholesteryl ester and triglycerides). In control hamsters, oil red O labeled numerous subendothelial macrophage-foam cells located along the inner curvature of the aortic arch. Compared with controls, fosinopril reduced the number of intimal macrophage-foam cells/mm2, foam cell size and the fatty streak area by 85%, 38% and 90%, respectively. Captopril decreased these parameters by 44%, 16% and 53%. Thus captopril decreased early atherosclerosis without affecting plasma LDL cholesterol or blood pressure, which suggested that inhibiting ACE (or kininase II) directly impeded the accumulation and formation of macrophage-foam cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "553": "The renal response to a selective increase in the Na+ concentration of the blood perfusing the central nervous system was investigated in conscious dogs treated with the converting enzyme inhibitor enalaprilat and the aldosterone antagonist canrenoate. In split-infusion experiments the plasma [Na+] of carotid blood was increased (approx. 6 mM) by bilateral infusion of hypertonic NaC1. Concomitantly distilled water was infused into the v. cava making the sum of the infusions isotonic. In control experiments isotonic saline was infused at identical rates into all three catheters. Na+ excretion increased markedly in both series, 103 +/- 14 to 678 +/- 84 mumol min-1 during split-infusion and 90 +2- 14 to 496 +/- 74 mumol min-1 during the isotonic volume expansion. Peak rate of excretion, peak fractional sodium excretion, and cumulative sodium excretion were all significantly higher (P < 0.05) during split-infusion than during control experiments. Plasma vasopressin increased only during split-infusion (0.68 +/- 0.11 to 2.4 +/- 0.8 pg ml-1) while the increases in plasma atrial natriuretic peptide were similar in the two series. Urinary excretion of urodilatin (ANP95-126) increased significantly more during split-infusion (46 +/- 11 to 152 +/- 28 fmol min-1) than during the isotonic volume expansion (45 +/- 14 to 84 +/- 16 fmol min-1) (P < 0.05). It is concluded that the natriuretic mechanisms activated by a selective increase in the Na+ concentration of carotid blood and associated with increased excretion of urodilatin cannot be eliminated by blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.", 
    "554": "This pilot study was undertaken to generate preliminary data on the accuracy of captopril-enhanced renal scintigraphy with a relatively new radiopharmaceutical, 99Tcm-mercaptoacetyltriglycine (99Tcm-MAG3) for detecting significant renal artery stenosis. Truth data was based either on arteriographic or outcome criteria (blood pressure response to therapy). Twenty-seven subjects with suspected renovascular hypertension were studied with baseline and captopril-enhanced 99Tcm-MAG3 renal scintigraphy and renal arteriography. Scan interpretations were expressed as a probability of a significant renal artery stenosis. Scan interpretations were compared with renal arteriographic results, renal vein renin levels, blood pressure values after renal artery repair, and blood pressure control after 4-26 months of clinical follow-up. Using > or = 50% luminal obstruction on arteriography as the reference standard for renal artery stenosis and a high probability scan representing a positive test, the test sensitivity and specificity were 33 and 97%, respectively (using high or indeterminate probability to represent a positive scan, the test sensitivity and specificity were 67 and 83%, respectively). The negative predictive value of a low probability scan for renal artery stenosis was 80%. However, including a measure of renovascular hypertension (blood pressure response to renal artery repair) as the reference standard, the accuracy of the scan improves, with the negative predictive value of a low probability scan for renovascular hypertension increasing to 97%. Scintigraphic results were also positively correlated with renal vein renin values in a statistically significant fashion (two-tailed Fisher exact test statistic = 6.43, P = 0.0219). Captopril-enhanced 99Tcm-MAG3 renal scintigraphy is a moderately accurate technique for detecting renal artery stenosis. More importantly, our preliminary findings suggest that the scintigraphic technique using 99Tcm-MAG3 appears to predict the blood pressure response to renal artery repair in subjects with suspected renovascular hypertension, thereby separating subjects with haemodynamically insignificant renal artery stenosis from those with renovascular hypertension.",

The left ventricular ejection fraction increased slightly at rest and during exercise in patients with aortic regurgitation, but showed no change in the mitral regurgitation patients after 1 year of quinapril treatment. Echocardiographic studies showed that after 1 year of therapy there was a decrease of about 10% in the left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic diameter in both patient groups. Moreover, the left ventricular mass was reduced by 35% in the aortic regurgitation group (P = 0.0001), and left ventricular hypertrophy, which was present in all patients, was reversed completely.

There was a direct correlation between baseline IGF-1 and left ventricular mass in the hypertensive patients (r = 0.365, P < 0.001). All three ACE inhibitors caused similar reductions in IGF-1 levels, the left ventricular mass index and blood pressure after the treatment period. The effect of ACE inhibition on mean blood pressure was similar in patients with (-13%) and without (-12%) a regression of left ventricular hypertrophy. The mean change in IGF-1 levels with treatment was more pronounced in those patients in whom left ventricular hypertrophy regressed (-25 versus -12%).",

    "592": "GROWTH-PROMOTING EFFECTS OF ANGIOTENSIN: Angiotensin, a vasoconstrictive peptide, is now known to be an agent of vascular and cardiac growth and may directly influence the pathophysiology of coronary artery disease and ventricular remodeling. Vascular growth occurs when angiotensin activates autocrine and paracrine growth factors, including fibroblast growth factor, transforming growth factor beta-1 and platelet-derived growth factor, and is modulated by endothelium-derived vasodilators and growth inhibitors. ANGIOTENSIN AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE: The presence of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and angiotensin II has been demonstrated in vascular tissue, and these local substances are causally involved in the development of vascular lesions. Similarly, angiotensin can stimulate cardiac myocyte growth and matrix modulation. Cardiac tissue ACE is implicated in ventricular remodeling in the course of progressive heart failure. A genetic variant of the ACE gene has been reported to be associated with increased risks of cardiovascular pathology. ACE INHIBITOR THERAPY: To date, studies of ACE inhibitor treatment in human patients have not demonstrated any prevention of restenosis after angioplasty. However, recent clinical trials in postmyocardial infarction reported that ACE inhibitor therapy reduces recurrent myocardial infarction and prevents cardiac enlargement. Long-term prospective trials are currently being conducted to examine the effects of ACE inhibitor therapy on coronary ischemic events and coronary atherosclerosis, as evaluated by angiography or intravascular ultrasound, and the relationship between coronary events and ACE gene polymorphism.", 
    "593": "AIM OF STUDIES: The extent of cardiovascular alterations in hypertension is related quantitatively to the degree of hypertension. However, there is increasing evidence that humoral processes, which are not dependent on blood pressure, are of major importance in these alterations. In particular, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity seems to be involved. We therefore compared the effects of blood pressure reduction and of acute and long-term ACE inhibition on cardiac hypertrophy, arterial function and morphologic alterations in hypertension.", 
    "594": "To examine the acute effect of ACE inhibition on arterial compliance, we used an experimental model allowing a pressure-volume determination in the carotid artery in situ to assess arterial compliance in normotensive Wistar-Kyoto and spontaneously hypertensive rats. The pressure-volume relationship was determined after an acute, single, oral administration of either placebo or the ACE inhibitor quinapril in doses of 0.3 and 3 mg/kg. Both doses of quinapril produced a similar relaxation of arterial smooth muscle, approximately 80-90% of the maximum relaxation produced by potassium cyanide. LONG-TERM STUDY: We then studied the long-term effects of ACE inhibition compared with those of hydralazine. Four groups of 4-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats were treated for 4 months with quinapril at 1 or 10 mg/kg per day, hydralazine at 15 mg/kg per day or placebo. Blood pressure, plasma and aortic ACE activity, left ventricular weight and histomorphometric parameters of the thoracic aorta, the renal and the mesenteric arteries were evaluated. We found a marked dissociation between the effects on blood pressure and cardiovascular structural parameters. Whereas both hydralazine and 10 mg/kg quinapril prevented the development of hypertension and aortic hypertrophy in a pressure-dependent manner, only the ACE inhibitor prevented left ventricular hypertrophy and aortic collagen accumulation. These quinapril effects were observed even with a small non-antihypertensive dose (1 mg/kg); the effect on aortic collagen was related to a reduction in aortic but not plasma ACE.", 
    "595": "These results indicate that the acute and long-term effects of ACE inhibitors on arterial function and structure go well beyond their antihypertensive actions and seem to be related to inhibition of tissue ACE. However, while clear effects were observed in the particular arterial segment explored, it may not be valid to extrapolate these findings to other arterial segments.", 
    "596": "New approaches to renin-angiotensin blockade: The successful use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure has generated a great deal of research interest in developing new pharmacological approaches to block the renin-angiotensin system. In recent years, several new non-peptide angiotensin II antagonists have been synthesized and some of them are available for experimental and/or clinical investigations. Now that experience with the antagonist losartan is accumulating, it is important to compare the effects, the efficacy and the side effects of this agent with those of ACE inhibitors. Effects of losartan compared with ACE inhibitors: So far, ACE inhibitors and the angiotensin II antagonist losartan appear to have similar systemic and regional hemodynamic effects. The impact of ACE inhibition and angiotensin blockade on the various components of the renin-angiotensin system is also comparable except for a marked increase in plasma angiotensin II levels during angiotensin II blockade. This increase in circulating angiotensin II might theoretically lead to an excessive stimulation of the AT2 receptor subtype, but since the function of this receptor is not known it is impossible to evaluate the implications of this reactive rise. Renal effects of losartan: The renal effects of angiotensin II antagonists are also very similar to those of ACE inhibitors. However, a marked increase in uric acid excretion has been observed with the administration of losartan. This uricosuric effect of losartan might represent a clinical advantage unless a state of urinary supersaturation of undissociated uric acid is achieved.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

In rats treated with imidapril the major finding was that imidapril rapidly ameliorated the damage to the blood-brain barrier and resolved brain oedema within 1 week. At the same time the neurological symptoms observed after stroke disappeared. Furthermore, none of the rats treated with imidapril showed recurrence of stroke, and their survival rate was improved.",

Contralateral kidneys enlarged significantly and their total renin content decreased significantly compared with hydronephrotic and sham kidneys. Plasma renin was unchanged. Fewer juxtaglomerular cells were labelled for renin and prorenin in contralateral than in hydronephrotic or sham kidneys. Granulopoiesis and exocytotic profiles were markedly greater in hydronephrotic than in contralateral or sham kidneys.

Treatment with alpha-MD did not affect the circulating levels of kininogen, the bradykinin precursor. 4. Pretreatment with captopril that potentiates the depressor effects of bradykinin did not potentiate the hypotension to alpha-MD. 5.

    "623": "This study investigated the protective effect of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, ramipril, on endothelium-dependent responses in arteries from control (CON) and streptozotocin-induced (STZ) diabetic rats. Three hypotheses were tested: 1) there is an endothelium-dependent component to the increased alpha-adrenergic responsiveness characteristic of diabetes; 2) endothelium-dependent, acetylcholine-induced relaxation is attenuated in aorta from diabetic rats; and 3) ramipril (3 mg/kg daily in the food, 12-15 weeks) will prevent functional vascular changes in diabetic rats. Vascular function was assessed in aortic rings using standard muscle bath procedures for measurement of isometric force. Sensitivity to phenylephrine was increased in aortic rings from diabetic compared to control values [pD2 values (-log ED50): CON = 6.22 +/- 0.12, STZ = 7.54 +/- 0.11), and removal of the endothelium (-Endo) increased phenylephrine sensitivity (CON-Endo = 7.40 +/- 0.11, STZ-Endo = 8.32 +/- 0.18). The magnitude of the shift in responsiveness following endothelium removal was greatest in control rats. Ramipril treatment (Ram) partially normalized phenylephrine responsiveness in intact (STZ + Ram = 6.55 +/- 0.11) and denuded (STZ-Endo + Ram = 7.75 +/- 0.10) vessels. Vasodilatation to acetylcholine and nitroglycerin was not altered in diabetic rats nor was it affected by ramipril treatment. Diabetes increases contractile sensitivity to phenylephrine but not to vasodilators and chronic ramipril treatment prevents this increase in contractile sensitivity. Ramipril treatment did not alter the hyperglycaemic condition induced by streptozotocin. The changes in phenylephrine sensitivity appear to involve an endothelial and a smooth muscle component.", 
    "624": "Trandolapril (RU44570) is an ethyl ester prodrug of trandolprilat (RU44403) having angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity. Disposition of RU44403 was investigated by oral or intravenous administration of RU44570 (0.1, 1, and 3 mg/kg p.o. or 1 mg/kg i.v.) and RU44403 (0.94 mg/kg p.o.) to rats. Orally dosed RU44403 was scarcely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract (3% of dose), whereas its prodrug was found to be rapidly absorbed (32.1-45.7% of dose) and completely transformed to RU44403, giving maximum plasma concentration within 0.5 hr. Regardless of both dose level and route of administration, almost similar plasma concentrations of RU44403 were observed in the terminal phase following doses of RU44570, resulting in prolonged elimination half-life, 89.01, 63.29, and 62.64 hr for 0.1, 1, and 3 mg/kg p.o. and 63.52 hr for 1 mg/kg i.v., respectively. Furthermore, oral AUC0-infinity of 0.1 mg/kg RU44403 was not dose proportional, suggesting nonlinear pharmacokinetic profile. To elucidate the factors causing the nonlinear disposition, a dissociation constant of the active metabolite in plasma was determined using a one-compartment model in which free RU44403 in plasma was the sole form available for elimination from the compartment. The value of the constant was 0.024 nM, which was closely similar to that of the high-affinity binding site of plasma protein determined by the ultrafiltration method in vitro. Also, both values were comparable with an inhibitor constant of RU44403 to ACE in plasma that was obtained by Henderson's plot for a kinetic analysis of the tight binding of an enzyme and inhibitor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Chronic treatment with enalapril, at a dose of 3 mg/kg, p.o., significantly enhanced the number of capsaicin-induced coughs. Chronic treatment with trandolapril, at doses of 1 and 3 mg/kg, p.o., slightly enhanced the number of capsaicin-induced coughs. However, there were no significant differences in the number of capsaicin-induced coughs between trandolapril-treated and vehicle-treated animals. These results suggest that cough induced activity, one of the most serious side effects associated with chronic treatment with ACE inhibitors, of trandolapril is relatively lower than that of enalapril.", 
    "627": "1. Myocardial 'reperfusion injury' has been partly attributed to the production of free radicals which are cytotoxic towards cells. Neutrophils are recruited by ischaemic tissue and are one source of free radicals. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors can reduce 'reperfusion injury' and we decided to determine if ACE inhibitors might contribute to this effect by inhibiting neutrophil chemotaxis. 2. The effects of captopril (a thiol containing ACE inhibitor) and enalaprilat (a nonthiol ACE inhibitor) and N-mercaptopropionyl glycine (MPG) (a simple thiol) on neutrophil chemotaxis were tested in an in vitro Boyden chamber assay. 3. The chemotactic response of human neutrophils to fMLP was reduced by 27.6% with MPG (n = 8; P < 0.05), by 13.2% with enalaprilat (n = 8; P = 0.075) and by 5.2% with captopril (n = 8; P = 0.66) at 5 microM (therapeutic concentration.) 4. Neutrophil chemotaxis was significantly decreased with 50 microM and 500 microM MPG and enalaprilat and 500 microM captopril. 5. Supratherapeutic concentrations of ACE inhibitors can reduce neutrophil chemotaxis at high concentrations and this effect does not appear to be -SH dependent.", 
    "628": "The antihypertensive efficacy of isradipine has been widely studied. In most studies, however, blood pressure values were assessed by causal readings (CR) only. Furthermore, whether or not such blood pressure readings are sufficient proof of efficacy is still under discussion. Thus, a multicenter study was devised wherein blood pressure were recorded by CR, self-recordings, and noninvasive ambulatory monitoring (ABM). A total of 595 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension were treated for 6 months starting with 1.25 mg of isradipine twice daily. If, after 4 weeks of treatment, CR-determined diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was still > 90 mm Hg, this dosage was doubled (n = 327) and, at week 8, pindolol at 5 mg or spirapril at 3 mg daily was added if necessary for blood pressure control. On the basis of CR, the results confirmed that low dosages of isradipine twice daily are safe and effective in the treatment of mild-to-moderate hypertension. The mean decrease in CR-determined blood pressure was 28.5/19.0 mm Hg at week 24, and the normalization rate (DBP < or = 90 mm Hg) for all patients treated was 78.2%. However, SR-determined blood pressure reduction was 20.0/13.0 mm Hg, with a normalization rate of 42%, whereas ABM-determined blood pressure reduction was 7.0/4.2 mm Hg. On the basis of ABM recordings, 66% of the patients had a DBP < 90 mm Hg on entry into the study and their blood pressures did not decrease with treatment. Thus, it appears that CR-determined blood pressures bias study results by including normotensives and thereby overestimating efficacy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "629": "The benefits of treating isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) have been established, but the most appropriate choice of drug is still uncertain. For this reason, a sustained-release formulation of isradipine was compared with spirapril in a double-blind randomized study in elderly Chinese patients with ISH. The dosage was titrated if necessary after 4 weeks of treatment. The reduction in systolic/diastolic blood pressure after 8 weeks was similar for both treatments--20/10 mm Hg with isradipine versus 24/6 mm Hg with spirapril--measured in the supine position. There were no orthostatic symptoms and both treatments were well tolerated.", 
    "630": "There is no doubt that calcium antagonists are effective antihypertensive agents. Their antihypertensive potency is comparable with that of beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Blood pressure decreases are dose dependent with no orthostatic reactions, and are more pronounced in patients with lower renin levels, which is demonstrable in both white and black patients; whether the blood pressure response is stronger in elderly patients remains to be ascertained. Blood pressure rises during stress are moderately decreased. Basic documentation has been obtained for first-generation calcium antagonists, and the newer members of this class of drugs--nearly all dihydropyridine derivatives--were developed to achieve greater vascular specificity and a longer duration of action. With calcium antagonists, blood pressure decreases are due to decreases in peripheral resistance. However, blood flow increases do not necessarily persist over time, thus raising the question of what is the mechanism for the long-term decreases in blood pressure. Several studies have shown that blood pressure variability is unchanged with calcium antagonists. However, blood pressure decreases are accompanied by regression of left ventricular hypertrophy, which is understandable in light of the strong correlation between parathyroid hormone and left ventricular hypertrophy. The use of calcium antagonists in the treatment of clinical hypertension can be guided by the following facts: 1) They are metabolically neutral and are accompanied by few or no life-threatening side effects that, when they do occur, tend to disappear over time; 2) They increase blood flow to muscle and help control angina pectoris as well as vasospastic diseases.", 
    "631": "Microvascular and macrovascular complications are a major cause of increased morbidity and mortality in patients with diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Atherosclerosis is the major cause of these complications. Recently, Hebden and colleagues demonstrated endothelial injury in a rat model with streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus and deoxycorticosterone acetate-induced hypertension. To determine if captopril and verapamil reduce endothelial injury in this model of diabetic hypertensive (DH) rats, we evaluated mean medial thickness and intimal cell changes in four groups of rats: control, untreated DH rats, captopril-treated DH rats, and verapamil-treated DH rats. Mean medial thickness increased from 63.5 +/- 4.8 microns in control rats (n = 7) to 107.2 +/- 7.5 microns in untreated DH rats (n = 8), (P < .05). Verapamil and captopril blunted DH-induced medial thickening to 90.1 +/- 4.9 and 93.7 +/- 8.3 microns, respectively (P < .05 compared with control and untreated rats). An endothelial injury index (EI), consisting of white blood cells adhered to the intimal surface and rounded endothelial cells per 25-microns arc in aortic vessels, was determined for each group. The EI increased from 0.2 +/- 0.1 cells/25-microns arc in control rats to 6.3 +/- 4.0 cells/25-microns arc in untreated DH rats. Both verapamil and captopril diminished the EI in DH rats to 0.8 +/- 0.2 and 2.7 +/- 0.3 cells/25-microns arc, respectively (P < .05 compared with untreated DH rats). In addition, verapamil decreased the EI in DH rats to a greater degree than captopril (P < .05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "632": "The metabolic effects of lisinopril and bendrofluazide therapy were studied in 61 patients with essential hypertension in a randomized, double-blind study with parallel groups. The insulin sensitivity index, measured by hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp test, decreased by 22% (P < .01) during bendrofluazide treatment and by 15% (NS) during lisinopril treatment. The initial insulin response at intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) increased by 21% (P < .05) during lisinopril treatment but decreased by 13% (P < .05) during treatment with bendrofluazide, and in addition, the glucose disappearance rate decreased by 9% (P < .05) in the latter group. During oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), the area under the glucose curve (AUCglucose) increased by 17% (P = .05) in the bendrofluazide-treated group but decreased by 19% (P = .05) in the lisinopril group, although there was no difference between the drug effects on AUCinsulin. The LDL/HDL cholesterol ratio increased during bendrofluazide treatment. The serum potassium concentration decreased by 10% (P = .0001) during bendrofluazide treatment but increased by 6% (P = .0001) in the lisinopril-treated group. The change in serum potassium was correlated to the change in initial insulin response and glucose disappearance rate at IVGTT, and inversely correlated to the change in AUCglucose at OGTT. In conclusion, alterations in serum potassium balance may affect the initial insulin release and glucose disposal. Bendrofluazide treatment decreases the serum potassium concentration, reduces the initial insulin release and the glucose disposal, and, in addition, impairs insulin sensitivity. Lisinopril treatment increases serum potassium concentration and the initial insulin response, and decreases AUCglucose, but does not improve insulin sensitivity per se.", 
    "633": "Endothelin modulates human mesangial cell (HMC) proliferation in response to angiotensin II (Ang II). Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) have variable effects on HMC growth depending on culture conditions. No studies, however, have investigated the effects of ACEIs on HMC production of endothelin-1 in either actively proliferating or quiescent HMCs. The present study was designed to evaluate the effects of ACEIs on HMC-associated mitogenesis, cell counts, and endothelin-1 production in the presence and absence of insulin in both quiescent and proliferating HMCs. It tests the hypothesis that ACEIs attenuate HMC growth through a reduction in HMC-associated endothelin-1 generation. The effects of four different ACEIs, an Ang II receptor antagonist, losartan, and a monoclonal antibody to endothelin-1 were evaluated. ACEIs inhibited HMC mitogenesis and cell counts in proliferative but not quiescent cells. This was due to the absence of ACE activity in HMCs and its presence in 10% fetal calf serum. Both ACEIs and losartan reduced endothelin-1 production per cell. Compared to vehicle, losartan reduced the amount of endothelin-1 in conditioned media to a greater extent than any ACEI (2.2 +/- 0.3, captopril v 1.9 +/- 0.5, quinaprilat v 3.8 +/- 0.3 delta pg/cell x 10(-3) endothelin-1, losartan; P < .05). Moreover, insulin potentiated the antimitogenic effects of both ACEIs and losartan on HMCs. Lastly, the attenuated increase of endothelin-1 in conditioned media and associated antimitogenic effect on HMCs with losartan alone was not potentiated by the addition of any ACEI to losartan. These data provide indirect evidence that Ang II production may occur in culture media when both its precursors and a sufficient amount of converting enzyme activity are present. This is predicated on the observation that HMCs lack ACE activity and that ACEIs blunt mitogenesis of proliferating HMCs. The kinetics of this reaction, as well as the mechanism of how insulin potentiates the antimitogenic effects of ACEIs, were not studied.", 
    "634": "The retail cost for antihypertensive medication in the Cincinnati area was examined using a questionnaire sent to 20 local pharmacies asking them to provide the cost to the patient for a 30-day supply of medication. Six pharmacies responded, providing a detailed list of drug prices. The price for a given drug varies considerably from pharmacy to pharmacy, with generics having the greatest variability. There are also large differences between agents within a drug class, leading to overlap between classes. Some diuretics and beta-blockers are more expensive than angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or calcium-channel blockers. For some agents a dose increase costs nothing, whereas for others it dramatically increases the cost. The price structure for antihypertensive agents is complex. Without detailed and current information, a physician will find it difficult to estimate the cost of a given prescription.", 
    "635": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, which prevent the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, reduce alcohol intake when injected peripherally. The mechanism by which ACE inhibitors produce this effect on alcohol intake is unknown. A rise in the biosynthesis of angiotensin II in the periphery is known to reduce alcohol intake. In this experiment, we examine the possibility that the reduction in alcohol intake produced by an ACE inhibitor, enalapril, is mediated by a rise in angiotensin II in the brain. Enalapril, 20 mg/kg, injected intraperitoneally, produced a 40% reduction in alcohol intake. This reduction was not attenuated by the concurrent administration into the lateral ventricle of either the ACE inhibitors captopril or ceranapril (1, 10, or 25 micrograms), or the angiotensin II receptor antagonist Sar1-Thr8-Angiotensin II (5 micrograms). These findings suggest that the ACE inhibitors do not reduce alcohol intake by raising angiotensin II in the brain.",

In vitro, S 2864 inhibited the activity of purified human plasma renin with an IC50 of 3.8 x 10(-10) mol/l and did not affect related human aspartyl proteases like human cathepsin E, cathepsin D or pepsin. In vivo, in anesthetized sodium depleted rhesus monkeys S 2864 decreased mean arterial blood pressure after intraduodenal (i.d.) administration of 2 mg/kg significantly by 27% from 94 +/- 8 to 62 +/- 6 mmHg for 90 min. Heart rate was not changed. Cumulative intravenous (i.v.) administration of S 2864 or remikiren in doses of 1, 10 and 30 micrograms/kg significantly decreased systemic blood pressure, dP/dtmax and cardiac output while heart rate was not changed. Plasma angiotensin II (ANG II) levels as well as renin activity were dose dependently reduced after 10, 30 and 60 min. It is concluded that S 2864 is an effective specific inhibitor of human renin eliciting marked blood pressure lowering activities in primates.", 
    "638": "Guidelines for the management of high blood pressure have been recently actualized by several expert panels. These reports display many common features: 1) non-pharmacological or pharmacological therapy should be initiated only after careful evaluation of hypertension (including repeated measurements of blood pressure) and associated cardiovascular risk factors; 2) life-style modifications should always be recommended: weight loss when overweight, regular physical activity, sodium restriction, moderation of alcohol consumption, smoking cessation; 3) initial drug therapy: all reports advocate the use of a low-dose diuretic or of a beta-blocker. According to contraindications or concomitant disease(s), other drugs can be used as initial therapy: converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium antagonists, alpha 1-blockers, alpha-beta-blockers.",

However, it is not clear whether these beneficial effects are due solely to blockade of angiotensin-II production and/or also involves any contribution by kinins. The present study was performed in Inactin (5-ethyl-5-(1-methylpropyl)-2-thio-barbiturate sodium)-anesthetized spontaneously hypertensive rats aged 10-13 wks to examine the relative influence of the angiotensin receptor antagonist losartan (2-n-butyl-4-chloro-5-hydroxymethyl-1- [(2'-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)biphenyl-4-yl)methyl] imidazole potassium salt) and the bradykinin receptor 2 antagonist HOE 140 (D-Arg-[Hyp3, Thi5, D-Tic7, Oic8] bradykinin) on renal and hemodynamic responses to the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor ramiprilat. We found that ramiprilat (1 mg/kg, i.v.) caused sustained reduction in mean blood pressure, marked increases in urine output and urinary sodium excretion without alteration in glomerular filtration rate. In a separate group of animals, it was found that losartan (1 mg/kg, i.v.) decreased blood pressure to a similar degree as ramiprilat and the magnitude of blood pressure fall seen following the combined administration of ramiprilat and losartan was similar to that caused by either compound alone. However, the increase in urinary sodium excretion seen following losartan administration was significantly smaller than that following ramiprilat or ramiprilat plus losartan.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "640": "We previously reported the renal hemodynamic effects of different antihypertensive regimens in uninephrectomized, alloxan-induced, diabetic (DM) beagle dogs following one year of treatment. Dogs were prospectively randomized to one of five groups (N = 26): nondiabetic controls, Group I; dogs with DM on no antihypertensive drugs, Group II; dogs on a converting enzyme inhibitor, lisinopril (L), Group III; dogs on a calcium antagonist, TA3090 (diltiazem-like), Group IV; and dogs on a combination of each drug, in reduced doses, Group V. The current paper extends our previous studies by describing the morphologic changes that occurred within each group of dogs studied. More than 100 glomeruli from the renal cortex of each dog were evaluated for increases in mesangial volume fraction (Vv), glomerulosclerosis (GS) and ateriolar hyalinosis. The interstitium was also evaluated for associated changes. Increases in Vv were attenuated in all treated groups (0.28 +/- 0.04, DM alone versus 0.16 +/- 0.05 L; 0.21 +/- 0.07, TA-3090; 0.19 +/- 0.06 micron 2/micron 2, L+TA 3090; P < 0.05) compared to untreated DM. An attenuated increase in Vv also correlated with a blunted rise in proteinuria in Groups III (r = 0.79) and V (r = 0.81) but not Group IV (r = 0.29). Development of focal GS was blunted in all treated groups; however, global GS was fourfold greater in Group IV compared to untreated DM. The degree of interstitial fibrosis also correlated with the degree of global GS. These data support the concept that both a converting enzyme inhibitor and heart rate lowering calcium antagonist attenuate morphologic progression of diabetic renal disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Fourteen patients withdrew from therapy; six patients withdrew because of adverse events (lisinopril, n = 3; diltiazem SR, n = 1) and lack of BP control (lisinopril, n = 1; diltiazem SR, n = 1). Both monotherapies were titrated upward (lisinopril 20-40 mg daily, diltiazem SR 120-180 mg twice daily) to achieve an office DBP < 90 mmHg. Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ; 25 mg daily) was added to monotherapy after week 4 if patients did not reach the BP goal (i.e. non-responders). After four weeks of therapy, 72% of patients (74 of 103) were nonresponders. At eight weeks of therapy, 66 patients (lisinopril, n = 32; diltiazem SR, n = 34) had received HCTZ. At week 8, 53% of lisinopril and 36% of diltiazem SR patients met the response criteria. Mean office DBP decreased from baseline -18.1 +/- 8.6 mmHg for lisinopril patients and -15.9 +/- 10.1 mmHg for diltiazem SR patients at week 8. Lisinopril was as effective as diltiazem in reducing systolic and diastolic office BP at week 4 (p > 0.1). Likewise, at weeks 4 and 8, no statistically significant differences were detected between treatments (p > 0.05) for systolic and diastolic ambulatory BP averaged over 24 hours. Both treatments were well tolerated and showed important antihypertensive efficacy in patients with moderate to severe BP elevation.", 
    "642": "The diameter and the stiffness of the distal portion of the abdominal aorta and of the common carotid artery were evaluated noninvasively in 72 subjects with mild to moderate hypertension by comparing 39 normotensive controls of same age and sex distribution. For each arterial segment, pulsatile changes of diameter were determined by a newly described echotracking technique and pulse pressure was evaluated by applanation tonometry and oscillometric methods. In both territories, distensibility of hypertensive subjects was significantly reduced but compliance was reduced only at the aortic level. Diastolic diameter was increased at the carotid but not at the aortic site. Multiple regression analysis indicated that whereas compliance and distensibility were strongly influenced by BP in the terminal aorta, age was the predominant factor influencing carotid arterial stiffness. Following 30 days of converting enzyme inhibition, the decrease of BP was associated with a normalisation of aortic compliance and distensibility whereas no change was observed at the site of the carotid artery. The study provides evidence that the response of the arteries to the changes of BP differ in the various parts of the arterial tree. This factor may influence the drug effect produced by chronic converting enzyme inhibition.",

Further study is required to determine the precise mechanisms through which angiotensin II promotes growth as well as the mechanisms through which ACE inhibitors block growth. Large scale clinical trials are needed to delineate further the effectiveness of ACE inhibitors in humans, especially regarding vascular smooth muscle growth.", 
    "644": "The effect of chronic angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition on the incidence of fatal ventricular fibrillation during regional myocardial ischaemia and reperfusion is not known. A reduction in cardiac angiotensin II and/or a vagomimetic response may result in antiarrhythmic activity. Pigs pre-treated with the ACE inhibitor trandolapril 0.3 mg.kg-1 or placebo orally for 10 days were subjected to thoracotomy. The left anterior descending coronary artery was ligated (CAL) for 20 min and reperfused for 45 min. Trandolapril decreased cardiac ACE activity and prevented the fall in the ventricular fibrillation threshold (VFT) during ischaemia: after 5 min of ischaemia the VFT in the trandolapril group was 25.5 +/- 4.6 mA (mean +/- SEM) vs 13.1 +/- 2.2 mA in the placebo group (P < 0.05). Trandolapril also decreased the incidence of spontaneous ventricular fibrillation during reperfusion to 1/6 vs 6/7 in the placebo group (P < 0.05). Heart rate in the trandolapril group fell. During ischaemia, trandolapril increased blood flow in the non-ischaemic zone, but decreased blood flow in the central ischaemic zone of the left ventricle. Similarly it decreased tissue levels of phosphocreatine in this zone. During reperfusion trandolapril increased blood flow both in non-ischaemic and central ischaemic zones. Chronic oral pre-treatment with trandolapril resulted in marked antifibrillatory effects which were associated with inhibition of cardiac ACE activity and a decreased heart rate.", 
    "645": "The effects of nisoldipine on regional myocardial perfusion and neuro-hormonal status were assessed in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 32 patients. All patients had ischaemic left ventricular dysfunction, with a left ventricular ejection fraction between 25% and 35%; per protocol, they were stratified according to concomitant use of ACE inhibitors. After baseline measurements at rest, including single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with Tc-MIBI, plasma neuro-hormones (norepinephrine, renin, arginine vasopressin, atrial natriuretic peptide) and echocardiography, the patients were randomized to nisoldipine (core coat tablet, 20 mg once daily; n = 16) or placebo (n = 16). Measurements were repeated after 8 weeks. SPECT data were analysed qualitatively (visual comparison by blinded observer) and quantitatively to derive an index of hypoperfusion representing the percentage of the left ventricular mass with Tc-MIBI activity below normal. At baseline, all patients had left ventricular areas with reduced Tc-MIBI uptake and 29 patients also had increases in plasma neuro-hormones. With nisoldipine, the extent of hypoperfusion (quantitative analysis) was reduced in 8/14 patients vs only 2/14 patients with placebo (P = 0.046, 2-tailed test). The benefit of nisoldipine was similar in patients with or without ACE inhibitor therapy and was also confirmed by the visual analysis of the data. Further, none of the neuro-hormones examined was significantly modified by nisoldipine. Thus, chronically underperfused areas are present at rest in patients with ischaemic left ventricular dysfunction, and nisoldipine significantly improved Tc-MIBI uptake in these areas without evidence of detrimental changes in plasma neuro-hormones.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "646": "In view of growing scepticism as to the efficacy and safety of agents with predominant phosphodiesterase inhibiting properties in heart failure, the clinical efficacy and safety of pimobendan, a calcium-sensitizing and partially phosphodiesterase-inhibiting compound, was compared with enalapril in 242 patients with mild to moderate heart failure (NYHA classification II-III) despite diuretics and digitalis, and abnormal haemodynamics at baseline. Patients were randomly assigned to either pimobendan (average 10.3 mg.day-1, n = 119), or enalapril (average 10.7 mg.day-1, n = 123) in a double-blind fashion for 6 months. Forty-two pimobendan and 37 enalapril patients stopped the treatment, five pimobendan and six enalapril due to worsening of failure without death, whereas 13 and eight patients, respectively, died from cardiac disorders (ns). Other reasons for discontinuation and adverse events not leading to discontinuation were also comparable. Although Holter analysis at 14 days, but not at 6 months, indicated increased ventricular extrasystoles in pimobendan patients, these did not lead to serious clinical events. NYHA classification improved similarly in both groups, from 2.51 to 2.16 (pimobendan) and from 2.40 to 2.06 (enalapril). The number of patients needing a change in background therapy or hospitalization did not differ between the two groups. Haemodynamic variables at rest were improved by both compounds after 6 months. In contrast, only enalapril improved haemodynamics during exercise, and reduced the cardiothoracic ratio. The primary endpoint, exercise capacity, increased significantly during the first 3 months by 45 and 53 s, under pimobendan and enalapril, respectively, but, although unchanged thereafter, the improvement was no longer statistically significant at 6 months in either group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Outpatients with moderate to severe hypertension defined as supine diastolic blood pressure (DBP) > or = 105 mmHg and < or = 120 mmHg at the end of a 2 to 4-week placebo-baseline period were randomly assigned to one of the three treatments: once-daily 10 mg quinapril plus 12.5 mg HCTZ or monotherapy with these doses. After 4 weeks, the doses were to be doubled for the remaining 4 weeks. Three hundred and sixty-eight patients were randomized to double-blind medication; 346 completed the study. Seven patients withdrew due to lack of efficacy. Four patients withdrew due to side effects. In all three treatment groups, clinically significant reductions in DBP were achieved. Combination therapy was statistically more effective than each component taken as monotherapy. Adverse events were infrequent in all treatment groups. No patients experienced symptomatic hypotension or orthostatic hypotension.", 
    "648": "The study was designed to examine the safety and efficacy of acute interventional use of captopril on left ventricular volumes, ventricular arrhythmias and neurohormones during thrombolysis in patients with a first anterior myocardial infarction, within 6 h of onset of symptoms. Left ventricular dysfunction and prognosis after myocardial infarction can be improved by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition started after the ischaemic phase. Experimental evidence suggests that intervention during thrombolysis may lead to even further benefit. In a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial, 298 patients with a first anterior myocardial infarction, eligible for thrombolytic therapy were treated with captopril 6.25 mg or placebo, started immediately upon streptokinase infusion and titrated to 25 mg t.i.d.. The efficacy of captopril by an intention-to-treat-analysis to reduce left ventricular volumes, ventricular arrhythmias, neurohumoral activation and enzymatic infarct size was measured. During dose titration, mean blood pressure and heart rate were similar in both groups. However, hypotension after the first dose was reported in 18 patients on placebo and 31 patients on captopril (P < 0.05). At discharge, 80% of patients were on study medication. Left ventricular volumes were significantly increased in both groups at 3 months, but they tended to be lower in the captopril group; however, the differences were not statistically significant. The incidence of accelerated idioventricular rhythm and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia in captopril patients was lower than in placebo patients (P < 0.05), parallelled by transiently lower norepinephrine levels (P < 0.05) upon thrombolysis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "649": "Taken together, with the wide-spread use of ACE-inhibitors within the dialysis population, a novel type of hypersensitivity reaction has been recognized, which may occur not only during hemodialysis but also during other forms of extracorporeal therapy. From the data available today, it seems that such reactions are triggered by negatively charged biomaterials which are capable to activate factor XII, leading among others to the generation of bradykinin. Normally this kinin is rapidly degraded by the serine proteinase kininase II. Thus, in the absence of ACE inhibitors plasma bradykinin levels increase only moderately during dialysis with AN69 membranes and clinically most patients are free of symptoms. However, once kininase II, which is identical with converting enzyme, is blocked by ACE inhibitors, plasma levels may increase more than 100-fold and patients will suffer from severe anaphylaxis. Based on our present knowledge, the consequences for clinical medicine are straightforward. It is mandatory to avoid the combination of negatively charged membranes or other biomaterials with ACE inhibitor therapy. As there are many different membranes available, this should be no unsurmountable problem in the setting of clinical hemodialysis.", 
    "650": "Mediators and the effect of captopril on amino acid-induced hyperfiltration were studied. Acute intravenous L-arginine (arginine) infusion tests were performed twice, without captopril administration in 6 normal subjects (group I), before and after pretreatment with captopril in 10 normal subjects (group II) and 10 IgA nephropathy patients with slight renal dysfunction (group III). It was found that in all groups with and without captopril, arginine infusion led to a significant decrease in renal vascular resistance, and significant increases in renal plasma flow and plasma glucagon level. GFR was significantly increased in response to arginine only in normals without captopril pretreatment. Captopril pretreatment attenuated the rise in GFR following arginine infusion in normal subjects. Plasma renin activity and urinary cGMP were significantly increased in response to arginine only in normals without captopril pretreatment. No significant increase in urinary PGE2 was observed after arginine infusion in any groups. It was concluded that cGMP and glucagon are possible mediators for arginine-induced hyperfiltration and inhibition of renin-angiotensin system attenuates the arginine-induced rise in GFR.", 
    "651": "We used the hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp method to assess insulin-mediated glucose disposal in ten black South African patients with newly-diagnosed essential hypertension, compared to ten normotensive controls. The patients were all nonobese with normal glucose tolerance. Comparisons were made before and 12 weeks after treatment with a long-acting ACE inhibitor. The mean glucose disposal (M) and disposal expressed as glucose sensitivity index (M/I) were significantly reduced in the hypertensives vs. controls (M: 6.8 +/- 0.9 vs. 9.7 +/- 0.8 mg/kg/min; MI: 7.1 +/- 1.0 vs. 12.5 +/- 1.7 mg/kg/min/mU/l x 100) (p = 0.03 and 0.01, respectively). Following therapy, M/I increased in the patients to values not significantly different to those of the controls. Insulin resistance is an independent feature of essential hypertension in black South African patients, and is partially corrected by treatment with a long-acting ACE inhibitor.", 
    "652": "1. The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that beneficial effects of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)inhibitors are independent of a fall in blood pressure in rat experimental heart failure following coronary ligation. 2. The animals were assigned randomly to six groups; sham operation, controls subjected to coronary ligation (control), coronary ligation plus chronic treatment with ACE inhibitors at non- and hypotensive doses; perindopril (0.2 or 2 mg kg-1 day-1) or enalapril (2 or 20 mg kg-1 day-1) for three weeks starting one week after the ligation. 3. Systemic blood pressure was measured every week during the experiments. At the end of the treatments, cardiac function and heart weight (an index of myocardial hypertrophy) were determined. In the other animals, ACE activities in plasma and tissues including heart, kidney, lung and blood vessels were measured. 4. In the controls, cardiac ACE activity, weight of right ventricle and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) were higher compared to those in the sham-operated animals four weeks after the coronary ligation. However, ACE activities were not changed in plasma, kidney, lung and aorta by ligation of the coronary artery. 5. The chronic treatment with perindopril at a dose of 0.2 mg kg-1 day-1 inhibited the increase in ACE activity in cardiac tissue and suppressed the right ventricular hypertrophy without affecting systemic haemodynamics. In contrast, enalapril at a dose of 20 mg kg-1 day-1, but not 2 mg kg-1 day-1, prevented the development of the right ventricular hypertrophy. Enalapril at 20 mg kg-1 day-1 also lowered systemic blood pressure. 6. There is no significant correlation between systemic blood pressure and right ventricular hypertrophy at the end of the treatment with perindopril (r = 0.06) or enalapril (r = 0.1).7. These findings demonstrate that perindopril, an ACE inhibitor, prevents cardiac hypertrophy without affecting systemic blood pressure in the rat with heart failure after coronary ligation, and suggest that selective augmentation of ACE activity in cardiac tissue is involved in the progression of hypertrophy in this model.", 
    "653": "Most renin inhibitors are primate-specific. In the present paper, we describe the effects of CP-71,362, a pentapeptide which preferentially inhibits canine (and to a lesser extent, rat) plasma renin. Vs. the canine enzyme, its affinity (IC50 = 3.3 x 10(-12) M) is 1000x greater than for rat renin (IC50 = 3.3 x 10(-9) M), and 1000x greater than for human (IC50 = 2.3 x 10(-8) M), cynomolgus monkey (IC50 = 1.6 x 10(-8) M), or guinea pig (IC50 = 5.2 x 10(-8) M) enzyme. In anesthetized, sodium-depleted dogs, intravenous infusion of CP-71,362 (ED50 = 1.1 micrograms/kg/min) resulted in dose-dependent decreases (up to -35 mm Hg) in mean arterial pressure (MAP). The maximum fall in MAP was equivalent to that produced by i.v. captopril (5 mg/kg). Similar falls in MAP were observed in conscious sodium-depleted SHR (ED50 = 5 micrograms/kg/min). Via bolus injection, the action of CP-71,362 was relatively brief in dog, guinea pig, and SHR. We conclude that CP-71,362 is a potent canine/rat renin inhibitor and causes profound MAP lowering in these species.",

With an estimated cost of $56 billion annually for the treatment of heart disease, and an increasing prevalence due to aging of the population, both primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease take on major public health importance. New insights into the relationship between smoking, hypertension, physical activity, dyslipidemia, obesity, hyperinsulinemia and diabetes mellitus, clotting factors, and alcohol and the subsequent development of coronary heart disease are reviewed and means of intervention are highlighted. The role of aspirin, beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, antiarrhythmics, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in the secondary prevention of myocardial infarction are briefly reviewed and the potential role of hormone replacement therapy in women is discussed.", 
    "655": "Isotope renography is a commonly used investigation for the detection of renal artery stenosis (RAS) in hypertensive patients, although its predictive accuracy is poor in an unselected population with a low prevalence of RAS. The aim of the present study was to identify characteristics of hypertensive patients that raise the clinical suspicion of underlying RAS, and which are predictive of an abnormal isotope renogram. The characteristics of 75 patients who had undergone either conventional or ACE-inhibitor-enhanced renography were retrospectively assessed and correlated with the renogram results. The presence of a raised serum creatinine, severe systolic hypertension at presentation and the requirement for triple drug therapy best predicted abnormalities on renography. However, it would appear that the false-positive rate of this investigation is high and its predictive accuracy is poor even in a highly selected group of patients. We conclude that isotope renography is of no practical value in the screening of hypertensive patients for RAS. Renal angiography remains the investigation of choice.",

The most frequent drug groups found were, in decreasing order, antihypertensives, benzodiazepines, nitrates and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. 53.3% of the patients took only angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and/or calcium-channel antagonists as antihypertensive drugs. Twenty four patients used occasional medications, sometimes as much as 6 different drugs, specially analgesics, antipyretics and anti-inflammatory agents. These patients took, in mean, 5.2 different drugs daily, 2.1 of which antihypertensive, in a total of 8.5 pills. Females took more drugs (9.4 +/- 3.6 pills per day against 7.1 +/- 3.0 in the male gender, Z < 0.03). Age and school instruction did not affect the intake.", 
    "657": "It is shown in a prospective study that the initial beneficial hemodynamic effect of nitroglycerine (NTG) significantly decreased after continuous 3-day infusion of this drug (10-50 micrograms/min) in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients associated with acute left heart failure. The effect of ameliorating anginapectoris and improving heart function with isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) gradually decreased almost to pretreatment levels after oral administration of this drug (10-20mg, 4 times daily) for 3 weeks in anginapectoris patients associated with congestive heart failure (CHF) with accompanying increased level of plasma angiotensin II (AII) and body weight. However, when captopril (CPT, 12.5-25mg, 3 times daily) was combined with nitrates, the clinical effects were enhanced and maintained throughout the study, along with a decrease in the level of AII and body weight. In the hearts of rats perfused with CPT and NTG, the coronary flow (CF) significantly increased as compared with the flow when either drug was used alone. Enelapril (ENL, a non-sulfhydryl drug), however, did not show such effect. The above results indicate that repletion of sulfhydryl to vascular smooth muscle and antineurohumoral activation may be the potential mechanisms by which CPT reverses nitrate tolerance and enhances its clinical effects.",

    "662": "The introduction of new drugs, and a re-evaluation of older drugs, have radically changed the pharmacological management of heart failure. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, digitalis, diuretics and the combination of nitrates and hydralazine are now used. The first Cooperative North Scandinavian Enalapril Survival Study (CONSENSUS I) and the second Vasodilator therapy in Heart Failure Trial (V-HeFT II) have demonstrated that patients with severe or advanced heart failure should be treated with ACE inhibitors, digitalis and diuretics (other vasodilators can be used if ACE inhibitors are contraindicated) to improve symptoms and duration of life. The Studies Of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD) and the Munich Heart Failure trial have shown that patients with mild heart failure should be treated with ACE inhibitors. However, data from several large clinical registries suggest that only 40% of patients with heart failure are being given ACE inhibitors perhaps through fear of serious renal damage or hypotension; these fears are unfounded. Patients with anterior myocardial infarcts and reduced left ventricular function also benefit from ACE inhibitors. The fourth International Study of Infarct Survival (ISIS 4) and results from the Gruppo Italiano per Io Studio della Sopravvivenza nell'Infarto miocardico 3 (GISSI 3) have indicated that patients with acute myocardial infarction benefit from early ACE inhibitor therapy and that survival is increased. Heart failure treatment can be optimized by establishing a disease etiology and stressing the need to restrict dietary sodium. ACE inhibitors should be used for depressed left systolic ventricular function, including patients in New York Heart Association class I heart failure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "663": "According to the Framingham Study, arterial hypertension and coronary artery disease are the major etiologic factors in the development of heart failure. Regulatory systems that may affect heart failure include the Frank-Starling mechanism, neurohormonal responses, cardiac growth and peripheral oxygen delivery. Recently, the interrelationship between the neuroendocrine system and cardiac growth has aroused much interest. In the pressure- or volume-overloaded heart, hypertrophic growth of the myocardium includes the enlargement of cardiac myocytes, an adaptation governed by ventricular loading. Nonmyocyte cell growth involving cardiac fibroblasts may also occur but is not primarily regulated by the hemodynamic load. Cardiac fibroblast activation is responsible for the accumulation of fibrillar type I and type III collagens within the interstitium and adventitia of intramyocardial coronary arteries, while vascular smooth muscle cell growth accounts for the medial thickening of these vessels. This remodeling of the cardiac interstitium is a major determinant of pathological hypertrophy in that it accounts for abnormal myocardial stiffness and impaired coronary vasodilator reserve, leading to ventricular diastolic and systolic dysfunction and, ultimately, symptomatic heart failure. Several lines of evidence suggest that the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is involved in regulating the structural remodeling of the nonmyocyte compartment; this accounts for the cardioprotective effects of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition, which prevents myocardial fibrosis in rats with renovascular hypertension. In rats with genetic hypertension, established left ventricular hypertrophy, abnormal diastolic stiffness due to interstitial fibrosis and reduced coronary vasodilator reserve associated with medial wall thickening of intramyocardial resistance vessels, the ACE inhibitor lisinopril restored myocardial structure and function towards normal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "664": "Case histories for three patients with heart failure were presented to an audience of cardiologists, general physicians, geriatricians and other specialists. The delegates responded via key pads to questions concerning management of the patients. The value of noninvasive investigations (eg, chest X-ray, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, exercise test) in establishing the diagnosis, management and prognosis was demonstrated. Most delegates indicated that they would prescribe angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in mild to moderate heart failure, although low doses were preferred to high doses in elderly patients. The importance of avoiding nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in patients on ACE inhibitor therapy was illustrated.", 
    "665": "Since the United Kingdom has fewer cardiology specialists than other countries, the United Kingdom cardiologist cannot provide direct care for all patients with chronic congestive heart failure (CHF). Most CHF care is provided by general practitioners, physicians or geriatricians. A survey of 100 CHF patients attending a health center revealed that these patients visited their general practitioners 270 times in 1 year, compared with only 34 outpatient visits. The cardiologist mainly provides echocardiography. The accurate diagnosis of mild CHF became imperative with the advent of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Results of a survey showed that although 1.6% of the population are taking diuretics for CHF, only 0.84% of the population have left ventricular systolic dysfunction on echocardiography. An estimated 22 echocardiograms per 1000 population per year are required (10 for structural reasons, three for suspected new CHF, three to identify patients with a low left ventricular ejection fraction and six to identify left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertensive patients). However, district general hospitals in Scotland can only provide 3.3-6 echocardiograms per 1000 population per year. The elderly CHF patient may not receive adequate treatment because of the lack of resources and a dislike of 'overinvestigating' or 'overtreating' the elderly. The benefits of echocardiography and ACE inhibitor therapy for all patients with CHF should be stressed.", 
    "666": "The effect of captopril (Cap) on electric activity of cultured rat myocardial cells under anoxia and reoxygenation was studied with standard microelectrode techniques. Results showed that anoxic solution caused lowerings of MDP, APA, and Vmax, and a shortening of APD50. All myocytes revealed multiform arrhythmias, and most cells stopped beating within 30 min, while only 40% of the cells exhibited arrhythmias but none stopped beating in the presence of 40 mg.L-1 under the same condition. During reoxygenation, most cells resumed beating in 10 min but some of these cells stopped beating again. The electric activities in rebeating cells during reoxygenation for 30 min were lower than those in normoxic cells. Cap (40 mg.L-1)-treated cells rebeat quickly after reoxygenation and no cell stopped beating any more, with parameters higher than those in untreated cells. These results demonstrate that Cap yields some beneficial effects on preventing anoxia and reoxygenation injury in cultured rat myocardial cells.", 
    "667": "Successful management of acute myocardial infarction depends in the first instance on the patient recognising the symptoms and seeking help as quickly as possible. Once in hospital, fast track admission procedures and protocols for pain relief, early thrombolysis and appropriate ancillary measures (eg aspirin, i.v. betablockers) should be promptly instituted. Specialist advice and, if necessary, transfer to specialist unit should be considered if additional complications arise. Follow-up management after discharge from hospital requires cooperation between primary and secondary care to prolong survival by reducing risk factors, using aspirin, betablockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and instituting a suitable rehabilitation programme. Audit measures are included in the report to help general practitioners and hospital doctors review their practice and assess it against the standards set.", 
    "668": "Secretion and synthesis of renin are stimulated by the lack of angiotensin II and by a low sodium intake. They are inhibited by a high sodium intake, by denervation and by propranolol. A high sodium intake can overcome the effect of the lack of angiotensin II. A low sodium balance and the lack of angiotensin II did not have additive effects. The sodium effects did not appear to depend on the presence of the macula densa, the presence of angiotensin II, or the presence of the nerve supply. It was not evaluated whether baroreceptors may be important in allowing sodium effects to be processed, but in the experiments conducted there were no significant changes in blood pressure associated with alterations in sodium balance. Sodium balance has an important effect on synthesis and secretion. This effect does not appear to be mediated by the usual set of controls and raises questions as to the signal relating sodium balance to renin synthesis. Secretion does appear to depend on macula densa. The role of the macula densa appears to control the basal level of renin secretion and to permit the conversion and processing of prorenin to renin."
