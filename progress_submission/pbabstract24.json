    "0": "The \"manometric\" way of considering the complex management of high blood pressure (HBP) must remain ancient history. The huge therapeutical armamentarium existing nowadays allows us to select the drug/s most appropriate for the comorbidities/particularities of each case. The BP level target, unanimously considered a very important element of HBP management, must not be the only one. The so-called pleiotropic effects of the different classes of antihypertensive drugs must always influence our way of thinking. Another important possibility to improve the therapeutical efficacy of the antihypertensive treatment is chronotherapy. The aim of the present study is to demonstrate the possibility of some benefic effects by imposing, by chronotherapy, a \"normal\" \"dipping\" status of the BP values. Among the surrogate end-points that can be used to demonstrate the benefits of this kind of HBP management we chose the structural and functional cardiac parameters, echocardiographically determined--using the criteria of the American Society of Echocardiography. We studied the evolution of these parameters of the left ventricle (LV) and we have evaluated them after 3 months of once-a-day morning (at awakening) administration, and respectively after 3 months of once-a-day administration in the evening (at bedtime) of: Prestarium (perindopril) cp 10 mg Tarka (cp 180 mg verapamil hydrochloride/2 mg trandolapril) Norvasc (amlodipine besilat) cp 10 mg as monotherapy, in 60 patients. We studied the anatomical parameters of the left ventricle (dimensions measured enddiastolically: the thickness of the interventricular septum, the thickness of the posterior wall, the internal diameter of the LV), the LV mass (which has a cutedge value for hypertrophy of the LV-LVH--of 134 g/m2 for men and 110 g/m2 for women) and the functional parameters, systolic as diastolic of the LV. We noticed a statistically significant reduction (p < 0.05) in all the 3 subgroups, of the functional parameters, these ones becoming similar to those in normotensive subjects only after the evening (at bedtime) administration of the studied drugs. The differences between the 3 subgroups for all the studied parameters, also in comparison with the normotensive subjects, have not been statistically significant after vesperal (at bedtime) administration of the studied drugs. It is, thus, possible that by an optimal treatment, chronotherapeutically \"tailored\", to obtain a normalisation of the anatomical and functional parameters of the LV and a significant improvement of the prognosis of these patients.",

Although combination therapy reduces proteinuria and blood pressure, adequately powered studies evaluating time to end-stage renal disease, death, or cardiovascular outcomes in patients with CKD have not been done. Dual blockade of RAS can cause hyperkalemia, renal failure, and orthostatic hypotension and potentially worsen outcomes; therefore, the risk-benefit ratio in patients with CKD remains unclear. A recent randomized trial in patients with cardiovascular disease or high-risk diabetes raises concerns about the safety of this combination therapy.", 
    "2": "Angio-oedema and urticaria can be symptoms of both allergic (IgE-mediated) and non-allergic drug hypersensitivity reactions. Non-allergic drug reactions, that may have a similar clinical presentation as allergic drug reactions, are not caused by an IgE-mediated immune mechanism. Because of unfamiliarity with non-allergic drug reactions and the unclear time course between drug use and reactions, the relationship with the responsible drug is often not recognized, leading to unnecessary patient risks. In the present article three patients with angio-oedema and urticaria as side effects of frequently used drugs (ACE-inhibitors, NSAIDs and betalactams) are presented and discussed. Patient A was a 69-year-old man with ACE-inhibitor induced angio-oedema. Patient B was a 40-year-old woman with urticaria and angio-oedema after ingestion of a NSAID caused by a non-allergic drug reaction. Patient C was a 54-year-old woman who developed an anaphylactic shock because of a type I allergy to betalactams.",

As a result, HF in the presence of normal or preserved ejection fraction, or diastolic HF, is increasingly recognized as a health care challenge. Guidelines have been issued for the classification, diagnosis, and prevention of HF from diastolic dysfunction, but treatment of this condition remains problematic. Antihypertensive agents that have been proven in clinical trials to improve outcomes in HF with systolic dysfunction, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and beta-blockers, have not yet demonstrated comparable benefits in patients with diastolic dysfunction. Combination therapy using an antagonist of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and a calcium-channel blocker has potential advantages over monotherapy and is being explored in several ongoing clinical trials.", 
    "12": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a crucial role in development of hypertension, heart failure, as well as in the whole process of nephropathy, particularly of diabetic nephropathy, with or without proteinuria. Blockade of RAS plays the key role in the management of hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors do not provide the full blockade of angiotensin II because it is produced through alternative pathways. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) also block the negative feedback of angiotensin II upon renin like ACE inhibitors, leading to a several fold increase in angiotensin II levels. Aliskiren is an orally-active, nonpeptidic, direct inhibitor of renin which simultaneously reduces angiotensin I, angiotensin II and plasma renin activity (PRA). This is the main point of action of aliskiren, making it completely different from ACE inhibitors and ARBs. Aliskiren introduces a new concept into the management of hypertension. However, the question concerning its real role in the management of heart failure and its place in the existing therapeutic schemes with ACE inhibitors, ARBs, beta blockers and antagonists of aldosterone receptor, will be answered by numerous ongoing studies and clinical trials. Aliskiren shows renoprotective and antiproteinuric effects similar to those of ACE inhibitors and ARBs. The available results demonstrate that aliskiren provides a new approach to the antagonism of the RAS, offering possibilities of a more efficacious and effective treatment of hypertension, heart failure and proteinuria in diabetic patient.", 
    "13": "Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a systemic disorder of connective tissue with autosomal dominant inheritance. The diagnosis of MFS is based on the identification of a combination of clinical manifestations in the ocular, musculoskeletal, and cardiovascular organ systems defined in the Ghent Nosology (De Paepe et al, 1996). Confirmation of the diagnosis in an individual requires the presence of major clinical manifestations in at least two organ systems associated with involvement of a third organ system. In relatives of an affected proband, major involvement of one organ system and involvement of a second organ system confirms the diagnosis. Major clinical criteria are very specific for MFS and include a combination of (4 out of 8) skeletal manifestations, ectopia lentis, dural ectasia and dilatation or dissection of the ascending aorta. The prevalence of- and the guidelines for the assessment of each of these major criteria are well established. Minor clinical criteria are less typical, but their importance in the diagnostic process should not be underestimated. Unfortunately, figures on the prevalence as well as practical guidelines for the assessment of most minor criteria are lacking, especially for those involving the cardiovascular system. The major cardiovascular manifestation in MFS is a progressive dilatation of the ascending aorta, leading to aortic aneurysm formation and eventually to fatal aortic rupture or dissection. Aortic dissection in early adult life is the leading cause of death in MFS. Early diagnosis of individuals at risk of the disease is extremely important as timely treatment of cardiovascular complications has greatly improved life expectancy in MFS. Despite progress in medical and surgical treatment of aortic aneurysms, MFS continues to be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. This may be related to inadequate diagnosis or treatment, but also to the occurrence of cardiovascular problems in ageing MFS patients that were unrecognised until now, such as left ventricular (LV) dysfunction.This thesis is focused on the study of cardiovascular manifestations of MFS which localize beyond the aortic root and on the presently unknown relationship between the severity of the cardiovascular phenotype and the genotype. In the first part, we have studied the prevalence and diagnostic value of the following cardiovascular manifestations of MFS: mitral valve prolapse (MVP) and calcification of the mitral valve annulus, dilatation of the main pulmonary artery (MPA) and dilatation or dissection of the descending aorta. We found a significantly higher prevalence of MVP in MFS patients compared to normal controls, indicating that this feature is useful in the diagnostic evaluation of the condition. In contrast, calcification of the mitral valve annulus appears to be very uncommon, difficult to quantify and therefore not useful in the diagnosis of MFS. We also studied the dimension of the MPA in a series of MFS patients and defined a cut-of value that can be used in the diagnostic evaluation of adult MFS patients. In addition, we showed that diameters of the aorta measured at different levels beyond the aortic root are increased in MFS patients compared to controls. Unfortunately, there was too much overlap with the values obtained in the normal control population to provide cut-off values for the descending aorta. Based on these findings, we developed practical guidelines for the cardiovascular evaluation of patients referred for MFS. In the second part, we studied LV function in MFS patients free of valvular heart disease using a combination of echocardiography (both conventional echocardiography and tissue Doppler imaging) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging. We could demonstrate that MFS patients present a combination of systolic and diastolic dysfunction that is not related to valvular heart disease. This may be attributed to a primary contractile dysfunction of the myocardium and is likely related to the underlying alterations in the elastic features of the myocardium, resulting from the microfibrillar defect. This observation is important in the development of new therapeutic strategies for MFS. Affected individuals may benefit from a treatment with agents that support myocardial function such as angiotensin converting enzyme--inhibitors or angiotensin II type-1 receptor blockers. Furthermore, since MFS patients survive longer thanks to improved medical and surgical treatments, LV dysfunction may become an important issue in the follow-up of these patients. In the third part, we have studied aspects of local and global wave reflection in the aorta of MFS patients. Early return of reflected waves boosts systolic pressure and presents an extra load for the heart and the central vessels. As such, these wave reflections are regarded as one of the important determinants of central blood pressure and can contribute to the development of aortic dilatation in MFS. However, we were unable to demonstrate clear differences in both local and global parameters of wave reflection between MFS patients and normal controls. This could be explained by the fact that increased length of the aorta on the one hand and increased aortic stiffness on the other hand counterbalance each other in MFS patients without yielding any net effect on wave reflection. In the last part of this thesis, we investigated the correlation between the severity of the cardiovascular phenotype in MFS and the type of FBN1 mutation. First, we investigated the correlation between parameters of aortic stiffness (distensibility and pulse wave velocity measured by Magnetic Resonance Imaging) and the type of FBN1 mutation (missense or in-frame deletions/insertions versus nonsense or out-of-frame deletions/insertions). We could not demonstrate any significant differences between these different mutation types, indicating that the FBN1 genotype is not the sole determinant of aortic stiffness. Second, we provided a detailed description of clinical findings in three unrelated MFS families in which an FBN1 mutation was identified and which demonstrate striking intrafamilial phenotypic variability as another illustration of the absence of genotype/phenotype correlations in MFS. This study also illustrated several important issues in MFS. First, repeated clinical examination of suspected patients can be necessary in order to establish a correct and final diagnosis. Second, extensive family history taking and clinical examination of first degree relatives can be highly contributory to the diagnosis. Third, patients with an 'atypical' MFS phenotype may show substantial clinical overlap with other connective tissue disorders such as Weill-Marchesani syndrome or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and represent a diagnostic challenge. We demonstrated that additional mutational analysis of the FBN1 gene can be a valuable aid to the diagnosis and help to outline medical management options in these challenging cases. In conclusion, we have refined diagnostic guidelines for the assessment of minor cardiovascular manifestations in MFS, shown that LV dysfunction is part of the cardiovascular spectrum and should be followed in the management of MFS patients, and demonstrated that aortic wave reflection is not elevated in MFS. In this work, we also investigated genotype/phenotype correlations, illustrated the marked (intrafamilial) variability in phenotypic expression of the condition, and the value of molecular testing in the diagnosis of MFS. Overall, this thesis nicely illustrates that close interaction and collaboration between cardiology and genetics is an added value to the study of disease pathogenesis of MFS and aortic aneurysms in general.",

Trustworthy decrease of portal hypertension parameters (the decrease of portovenosis gradient of pressure (PPG) by 19,3% (p = 0,048) in the patients with liver cirrhosis of class A on Child-Pugh without ascites with nebevolol was revealed. The trust worthy changes of portal blood flow was not revealed in all examined patients with lisinopril. But these patients without ascites have demonstrated the improvement of the renal hemodynamic (renal functional reserve (RFR) by 56%, effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) by 17,3%). The lisinopril intake 5 mg a day declines PPG by 18,1%. The tendency of the reduction of the functional index due to the expressed hypotensive effect of nebevolol and lisinopril was revealed in all examined patients with liver cirrhosis.

    "22": "Atherothrombosis is a generalized and diffuse progressive process manifesting in multiple vascular beds leading to acute coronary syndrome (ACS), ischemic stroke, and peripheral arterial disease. The American Heart Association estimates the prevalence of ischemic stroke, coronary heart disease, and peripheral artery disease to be 4.8, 13.2, and 8 million, respectively. According to the World Health Organization, in 2004, atherothrombosis was the leading cause of death worldwide. Twenty-two percent of all deaths are attributed to atherothrombosis, which is greater than the percentage of deaths from AIDS and cancer combined. Data from the Framingham Heart Study has shown atherothrombosis significantly reduces life expectancy. According to current data, there is an established relationship among coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, and cardiovascular disease. The REACH registry demonstrated that the 1-year cardiovascular event rates increase with the number of symptomatic disease locations. Unstable angina/non-ST-segment elevation MI is a major public health problem and represents the most common reason for hospital admission for coronary heart disease. Classification of \"vulnerable patients\" will help identify those with a high probability of developing cardiac events in the near future, and their early detection and treatment would help 50 to 60 million Americans over the age of 35. The management of patients with ischemic coronary disease consists of 2 approaches: revascularization and systemic (aspirin, clopidogrel, lipid-lowering therapy, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and \u03b2-blockers). There is a substantial long-term cardiovascular risk after discharge with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome with an annual mortality rate estimated at 6%. This emphasizes the importance of risk stratification and aggressive management strategies that target high-risk patients. Based on CAPRIE study and Cure trial results, patients can benefit from clopidogrel or its combination with aspirin. CRUSADE registry data reveal some acute medications are still being underused, most notably GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors (47%) and clopidogrel (54%). Improved American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline adherence is directly associated with reduced in-hospital mortality, and thus the need for quality improvement is imperative.",

At 39-month follow up, new stroke or new MI or death developed in 49 of 228 patients (21%) treated with ACE inhibitors or ARBs and in 33 of 78 patients (42%) treated without angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or ARBs (P = 0.0001). Stepwise Cox regression analysis showed that significant independent predictors of the time to development of new stroke or new MI or death were 1) use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or ARBs (risk ratio, 0.21), 2) diabetes (risk ratio, 4.01), 3) left ventricular hypertrophy (risk ratio, 6.71), 4) prior stroke (risk ratio, 4.00), and 5) prior MI (risk ratio, 3.69).", 
    "24": "Inhibitors of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) decrease angiotensin II production and activate an intracellular signaling cascade that affects gene expression in endothelial cells. Because ACE inhibitors have been reported to delay the onset of type 2 diabetes, we determined ACE signaling-modulated gene expression in endothelial cells and adipocytes. Using differential gene expression analysis, several genes were identified that were 3-fold up- or down-regulated by ramiprilat in cells expressing wild-type ACE versus cells expressing a signaling-dead ACE mutant. One up-regulated gene was the cellular retinol-binding protein 1 (CRBP1). In adipocytes, the overexpression of CRBP1 enhanced (4- to 5-fold) the activity of promoters containing response elements for retinol-dependent nuclear receptors [retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR)] or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR). CRBP1 overexpression also enhanced the promoter activity (by 470 +/- 40%) and expression/release of the anti-inflammatory and antiatherogenic adipokine adiponectin (cellular adiponectin by 196 +/- 24%, soluble adiponectin by 228 +/- 74%). Significantly increased adiponectin secretion was also observed after ACE inhibitor treatment of human preadipocytes, an effect prevented by small interfering RNA against CRBP1. Furthermore, in ob/ob mice, ramipril markedly potentiated both the basal (approximately 2-fold) and rosiglitazonestimulated circulating levels of adiponectin. In patients with coronary artery disease or type 2 diabetes, ACE inhibition also significantly increased plasma adiponectin levels (1.6- or 2.1-fold, respectively). In summary, ACE inhibitors affect adipocyte homeostasis via CRBP1 through the activation of RAR/RXR-PPAR signaling and up-regulation of adiponectin. The latter may contribute to the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors on the development of type 2 diabetes in patients with an activated renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "25": "Atrial arrhythmias, ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death (SCD) are significant health problems and an economic burden to society. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) may play a key role in the occurrence of structural and electrical remodeling, potentially explaining the development of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. Angiotensin II has been shown to regulate cardiac cell proliferation and to modulate cardiac myocyte ion channels. Results of post hoc analyses from prospective clinical trials appear to show that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are most effective in the prevention of new-onset atrial fibrillation in patients with heart failure. It is difficult to determine if these agents are useful in the prevention of new-onset atrial fibrillation after myocardial infarction, and available evidence suggests that the benefit of ACE inhibitors and ARBs for prevention of new-onset atrial fibrillation in patients with hypertension appears limited to those with left ventricular hypertrophy. Patients with structural changes in cardiac muscle, such as those with heart failure and left ventricular hypertrophy, appear to benefit the most from RAAS blockade, possibly due to the theory of reversal of cardiac remodeling. There is no evidence, to our knowledge, that either ACE inhibitors or ARBs facilitate direct electrical current cardioversion in patients with atrial fibrillation; however, it appears that RAAS blockade may be useful in the prevention of recurrent atrial fibrillation after direct electrical current cardioversion. Whether ACE inhibitors may prevent life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias or SCD is unclear. Aldosterone antagonists appear to be useful for the prevention of SCD in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Results from ongoing clinical trials are anticipated to provide further insight on the potential roles of RAAS inhibitors for the prevention of cardiac arrhythmias.",

Occurence of primary glomerular diseases in young and middle aged patients, in whom they restrain their lives and professional careers, results in their particular position among causes of replacement therapy. A highly important component of the therapeutic approach to nephrotic patients is appropriate symptomatic treatment. Proteinuria reduction is crucial in the prevention of progressive kidney function decline in the course of glomerulonephritis. A long-term therapy of glomerulonephritis should be conducted both by the general internal medicine specialist and the nephrologist. The treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers can be performed by the internist, but the immunosuppressive programs should be initiated and supervised by the nephrologist.", 
    "27": "Aortic valve regurgitation (AR) imposes a severe volume overload to the left ventricle (LV), which results in dilation, eccentric hypertrophy, and eventually loss of function. Little is known about the impact of AR on LV gene expression. We, therefore, conducted a gene expression profiling study in the LV of rats with acute and severe AR. We identified 64 genes that were specifically upregulated and 29 that were downregulated out of 21,910 genes after 2 wk. Of the upregulated genes, a good proportion was related to the extracellular matrix. We subsequently studied a subset of 19 genes by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) to see if the modulation seen in the LV after 2 wk persisted in the chronic phase (after 6 and 12 mo) and found that it did persist. Knowing that the adrenergic and renin-angiotensin systems are overactivated in our animal model, we were interested to see if blocking those systems using metoprolol (25 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)) and captopril (100 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)) would alter the expression of some upregulated LV genes in AR rats after 6 mo. By qRT-PCR, we observed that upregulations of LV mRNA levels encoding for procollagens type I and III, fibronectin, atrial natriuretic peptide, transforming growth factor-beta(2), and connective tissue growth factor were totally or partially reversed by this treatment. These observations provide a molecular rationale for a medical strategy aiming these systems in the medical treatment of AR and expand the paradigm in the study of this form of LV volume overload.",

In both cohorts, persistence continually diminished from the index date through follow-up, with > or = 75% of patients discontinuing statin therapy by 2 years. Baseline predictors of discontinuation of statin treatment included younger age, female sex, lower socioeconomic status (SES), absence of diabetes or hypertension, no concurrent use of beta-blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and less health service utilization.

The BP-lowering effect of the 2 drugs together was similar to that expected from the sum of each alone, allowing for the reduced effect of 1 drug given the lower pretreatment BP due to the other. The incremental systolic BP reduction from the 2 drugs together compared with 1 alone was 79% (95% CI, 54%-126%) of the expected additive effect, 88% (95% CI, 58%-130%) for diastolic BP, and 84% (95% CI, 65%-118%) for the mean of systolic and diastolic BP.",

    "52": "Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the leading cause of vision loss as a major complication of diabetes mellitus. The blood-retinal barrier (BRB) breakdown is a critical early event in the pathogenesis of DR. It has been known that the rennin-angiotensin system (RAS) is important in the progression of the DR via angiotensin II (Ang II), the effector of RAS. In this study, we showed that blockade of Ang II attenuates vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-mediated BRB breakdown in DR. In streptozotocin-induced diabetes, retinal vascular permeability increased with upregulation of VEGF, where Ang II and its receptors were upregulated. Ang II induced VEGF expression in retinal endothelial cells accompanied by loss of tight junction proteins. However, the blockade of Ang II by perindopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, inhibited upregulation of VEGF, and prevented the loss of tight junction proteins. Moreover, inhibition of Ang II by perindopril attenuated increased vascular permeability of diabetic retina accompanied by recovery of tight junction proteins in retinal vessels. Therefore, we suggest that the RAS involves in increased vascular permeability during early stage of DR, which is mediated by VEGF. Furthermore, the ACE inhibitor may have a therapeutic potential in the treatment of diabetic BRB breakdown.",

Methods and Results From admissions over the past 12 years, 210 patients with uncomplicated type B AAD were divided into 2 groups: Conventional therapy group (CG) of 90 who were treated by 7 days of bed rest and intravenous antihypertensive agents and the Clinical pathway group (CPG) of 120 who were treated by early rehabilitation. In the CPG, patients were administered oral medication from the first day after onset and took a short walk from the third day after onset. The incidence of respiratory complications, and of delirium, was significantly decreased in the CPG. Early mortality was similar: 3.3% and 2.5%, respectively. The diameter of the aorta had not enlarged in either group 1 month later. Conclusions The clinical pathway of treatment for uncomplicated type B AAD was safer and better for preventing early complications and cost benefit.",

New therapeutic approaches are clearly required and the conceptual origin of these new techniques will be derived from agents that protect the heart against stress and prolong longevity. The combination of stress protection and longevity has been observed in a variety of organisms, from yeast to worms to mammals, and could be the basis for a novel approach to heart failure therapy. A mouse model has been developed with genetic disruption of adenylyl cyclase type 5, which lives one-third longer than the wild-type and is protected from aging-induced, pressure overload-induced and catecholamine-induced stresses. Accordingly, inhibition of this molecule should be considered as a new therapeutic modality for heart failure.",

However, repeated episodes of congestive heart failure (CHF) were observed more frequently in patients with AIPT than in patients without AIPT (81.8% vs. 41.2%, P<0.011). In vitro examination, AMD progressively increased apoptosis of AEC and Ang II enhanced this effect of AMD (P<0.001). However, ARB inhibited the enhancement by Ang II of the AMD-induced apoptosis effect (P<0.001). Furthermore, patients with AIPT were administrated a lower dose of angiotensin system antagonists than were those without AIPT (P<0.05).",

A large proportion of individuals at high 10-year risk of a cardiovascular event live in low-income and middle-income countries, and the large majority of all cardiovascular events occur in developing countries. A large amount of evidence supports the use of pharmacological treatment for the prevention of cardiovascular death in this population, including antiplatelet drugs, beta blockers, lipid-lowering agents and angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors. However, the efficacy of cardiovascular prevention is hampered by several problems, including inadequate prescription of medication, poor adherence to treatment, limited availability of medications and unaffordable cost of treatment.

On the other hand, the intrinsic renin-angiotensin system in the bone marrow might affect the growth of hematopoietic colonies and cellular production, proliferation and differentiation in physiological and pathological states. Starting with the hypothesis that inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system may have some effects on the hematopoietic system, including morphological changes within the granulocytes, we thus aimed to investigate prospectively whether the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors has any effect on the morphology, and especially segmentation, of neutrophils in peripheral blood. A total of 40 children with various heart diseases receiving either of two angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (captopril or enalapril) aged between 2 to 16 years were enrolled, and 40 healthy age- and sex-matched children were enrolled as controls. Complete blood count, peripheral blood smear, liver and renal function tests, and measurement of serum alkaline phosphatase, ferritin, vitamin B12 and folate levels were performed in all cases. Peripheral blood smears were viewed by two pediatric hematologists in a blinded manner. Neutrophil hypersegmentation was described as presence of five or more neutrophils with five well-separated lobes or at least one neutrophil with six or more lobes among 100 segmented neutrophils. The number of patients with neutrophil hypersegmentation in the study group was significantly higher than in the control group, and the mean lobe count in the study group was significantly higher than in the control group. Neutrophil hypersegmentation, as detected in patients using angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in the present study, has not been reported previously. Further studies aiming to explain the pathophysiological mechanism(s) underlying neutrophil hypersegmentation in patients receiving angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are needed.",

However, the impact of multimorbidity due to DM and CKD on outcomes, relative to co-morbidity due to DM alone, has not been well studied in these patients. Of the 7,788 patients with chronic HF in the Digitalis Investigation Group trial, 2,218 had DM. We categorized these patients into those with DM alone (DM-only n = 1,123) and those with both DM and CKD (DM-CKD n = 1,095). Propensity scores for DM-CKD, calculated for each of the 2,218 patients, were used to match 699 pairs of patients with DM-only or DM-CKD. Matched Cox regression models were used to estimate associations between DM-CKD and outcomes. All-cause mortality occurred in 44% (rate 1,648/10,000 person-years) of patients with DM-CKD and 39% (rate 1,349/10,000 person-years of follow-up) of patients with DM-only (hazard ratio when DM-CKD was compared with DM-only 1.34, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11 to 1.62, p = 0.003).

In the DIG trial, patients with ambulatory chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure (HF) (n = 7,788) in normal sinus rhythm receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and diuretics were randomized to receive placebo (n = 3,899) or digoxin (n = 3,889). The median dose of digoxin (0.25 mg/day) and the target SDC (0.8 to 2.5 ng/ml) were higher than what are currently recommended, which in part may explain the lack of long-term mortality benefit of digoxin in the DIG trial. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of digoxin on short-term outcomes; 1-year all-cause mortality occurred in 392 and 448 patients respectively in the digoxin and placebo groups (hazard ratio for digoxin 0.87, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76 to 0.995, p = 0.043). Respective hazard ratios for cardiovascular and HF deaths were 0.87 (95% CI 0.76 to 1.01, p = 0.072) and 0.66 (95% CI 0.52 to 0.85, p = 0.001). All-cause hospitalization occurred in 1,411 and 1,529 patients receiving digoxin and placebo respectively (hazard ratio 0.89, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.96, p = 0.002).

Our objective was to evaluate the effect of the angiotensin-converting enzyme blockade on cortical renal GLUT1 and GLUT2 expression, urinary albumin and urinary TGF-beta1. Streptozotocin, 50 mg/kg, or citrate buffer (N = 16) was administered as a single injection into the tail vein in adult spontaneously hypertensive rats (approximately 260 g). Thirty days later, these diabetic spontaneously hypertensive rats received ramipril by gavage: 0.01 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) (D0.01, N = 14), 1 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) (D1, N = 9) or water (D, N = 11) for 15 days. Albumin and TGF-beta1 (24-h urine), direct arterial pressure, renal tissue angiotensin-converting enzyme activity (fluorometric assay), and GLUT1 and GLUT2 protein levels (Western blot, renal cortex) were determined. Glycemia and glycosuria were higher (P < 0.05) in the diabetic rats compared with controls, but similar between the diabetic groups. Diabetes in spontaneously hypertensive rats lowered renal tissue angiotensin-converting enzyme activity (40%), which was reduced further when higher ramipril doses were used. Diabetes associated with hypertension raised GLUT1 by 28% (P < 0.0001) and GLUT2 by 76% (P = 0.01), and both doses of ramipril equally reduced cortical GLUT1 (D vs D1 and vs D0.01, P < or = 0.001). GLUT2 levels were reduced in D0.01 (P < 0.05 vs D). Diabetes increased urinary albumin and TGF-beta1 urinary excretion, but the 15-day ramipril treatment (with either dose) did not reduce them. In conclusion, ramipril is effective in lowering renal tissue angiotensin-converting enzyme activity, as well as blocking cortical GLUT1 overexpression, which may be beneficial in arresting the development of diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "112": "Chronic inflammation is a pathogenic feature of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease mediated by substances including angiotensin II, proinflammatory cytokines, and free fatty acids. This promotes generation of reactive oxygen species in vascular endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells, which mediate injury through several mechanisms. Reciprocal relationships between endothelial dysfunction and insulin resistance as well as cross-talk between hyperlipidaemia and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) at multiple levels contribute importantly to a variety of risk factors. Therefore, combination therapy that simultaneously addresses multiple mechanisms for the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis is an attractive emerging concept for slowing progression of atherosclerosis. Combined therapy with statins, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, and RAAS blockade demonstrates additive beneficial effects on endothelial dysfunction and insulin resistance when compared with monotherapies in patients with cardiovascular risk factors due to both distinct and interrelated mechanisms. These additive beneficial effects of combined therapies are consistent with laboratory and recent clinical studies. Thus, combination therapy may be an important paradigm for treating and slowing progression of atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, and co-morbid metabolic disorders characterized by endothelial dysfunction and insulin resistance.",

Despite the escalated use of these agents, we continue to experience an unexplained epidemic of ESRD/CKD/ARF. There are concerns regarding potential iatrogenic renal failure arising from these agents. A case, it would appear, of unintended consequences. Our publication of several reports on the previously unrecognized syndrome of late onset renal failure from angiotensin blockade (LORFFAB) in 2008 adds to this evolving literature. At the same time, some recent reports have questioned the veracity of claims of superior reno-protection with these agents beyond BP lowering. A post hoc analysis of a subset of patients in the MICRO-HOPE cohort suggested that a previously unrecognized greater 24-h BP lowering achieved in the ramipril arm vs placebo could explain the reported benefits of the ACEI. These doubts and concerns became heightened by the results of the ONTARGET study. Our critical re-appraisal of the large RAAS blockade trials revealed design flaws and protocol contradictions that further these doubts and concerns. We conclude that these agents be used more judiciously, with better monitoring of kidney function. Treating physicians must consider drug discontinuation in selected patients. We also support temporary withdrawal of these agents before major surgical procedures, contrast media administration and during acute illness. Such preventative measures (reno-prevention) would enhance the benefits of reno-protection with RAAS blockade.",

ACE inhibitors and Angiotensin receptor antagonists offer a curative therapeutic approach. Beta-blocker are strongly recommended. Amiodarone may be used for symptomatic arrhythmia suppression--but with no proven favourable prognostic effect. The use of class-1 antiarrhythmic drugs is obsolete in the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy and heart failure. Implantable cardioverter/defibrillators (ICD) have been proven to have a positive effect on survival in secondary and primary prevention of sudden cardiac death, and so has cardiac synchronization in severe cardiac dysfunction and widened QRS complex. Atrial fibrillation (AF): Arterial hypertension represents the main risk factor for AF. Patients' age, left ventricular hypertrophy, left atrial dilatation and angiotensin-II activation play an important role in the induction and maintenance of AF. Angiotensin-receptor and beta-blockers seem to be efficacious in AF suppression and also on the regression of hypertrophy. The use of antiarrhythmic agents (AA) is limited because of their relatively low long-term efficacy and pro-arrhythmia properties. Best results may be achieved with class 1C AA drugs in patients with no or minimal structural heart disease. In all other cases amiodarone is suitable but is limited by its side effects. In patients with no or only a few symptoms rate control may be sufficient, but if there are symptoms interventional left atrial ablation of pulmonary veins should be attempted as a real curative strategy.",

In the further time course of disease LV dilatation will be present. In this phase of \"excentric hypertrophy\" LV systolic wall stress and myocardial oxygen consumption per weight unit myocardium rise and LV ejection fraction decreases. Patients with arterial hypertension frequently complain of angina pectoris. Angina pectoris and the positive exercise tolerance test or the positive myocardial scintigraphy are the consequence of the impaired coronary flow reserve. The coronary flow reserve is diminished due to structural and functional changes of the coronary circulation.

Although overall 14-months mortality was similar in quinapril with add-on hydrochlorothiazide and quinapril, stratification based on plasma creatinine showed increased mortality in the tertile with highest plasma creatinine (P=0.03, Log rank). With add-on hydrochlorotiazide, renal morphology displayed severe renal interstitial lesions; tubular dilatation and fibrosis. Interstitial myofibroblast transformation (alpha-smooth muscle actine staining) was increased at 8 and 14 months, and coincided with collagen deposition and interstitial inflammation (macrophage influx). In rats with quinapril monotherapy or untreated rats, renal structure was normal. Thus, adding hydrochlorotiazide to ACE inhibitor detrimentally affected not only renal function, but also renal structure in rats with myocardial infarction. Altered pharmacokinetics, resulting from a vicious circle of reduced renal function and increased circulating drug levels, may provide an explanation for the adverse renal effects and may exert unfavorable effects on long-term prognosis after myocardial infarction.", 
    "143": "Patients with type 2 diabetes are at considerable risk of excessive morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease (CVD). We investigated the clinical effectiveness of Pycnogenol, a flavonoid-rich dietary supplement, in reducing antihypertensive medication use and CVD risk factors in subjects with type 2 diabetes. Forty-eight individuals were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with parallel-group design. Patients were diagnosed with both type 2 diabetes and mild to moderate hypertension and were undergoing treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive either Pycnogenol pill (125 mg daily) or matched placebo for 12 weeks. According to the values of blood pressure (BP) measured at 2-week intervals, the pretrial ACE inhibitor dosage was left unchanged, reduced by 50%, or brought back to the pretrial dosage until a stable BP was obtained. Fasting plasma glucose, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), serum endothelin-1, and urinary albumin were evaluated monthly. Pycnogenol treatment achieved BP control in 58.3% of subjects at the end of the 12 weeks with 50% reduction in individual pretrial dose of ACE-inhibitors (P <.05). Plasma endothelin-1 decreased by 3.9 pg/mL in Pycnogenol-treated group vs 0.5 pg/mL increase in control group (P < .001). Mean HbA1c dropped by 0.8% in Pycnogenol-treated group (P < .05), whereas it decreased by 0.1% in control group. Fasting plasma glucose declined by 23.7 mg/dL in Pycnogenol-treated group vs 5.7 mg/dL in control group (P < .0001). Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol improved significantly in Pycnogenol-treated group, declining by 12.7 mg/dL (P < .001). A significant decrease in urinary albumin level was observed at week 8 compared with the control group (P < .05). However, this reduction was not significant at 12th week. After 12 weeks of supplementation, Pycnogenol resulted in improved diabetes control, lowered CVD risk factors, and reduced antihypertensive medicine use vs controls.", 
    "144": "Obesity is associated with an increased concentration of inflammatory mediators, which in turn, in adults, reduces the response to calcium channel blockers (CCBs). We reviewed the medical charts of 263 pediatric nephrology patients with renal conditions, with the aim of studying the effect of obesity on the response to L-type CCBs, angiotensin interrupting agents (ANGIs), or a combination of the two. Forty-eight patients were ultimately enrolled in the study: 25 obese and 23 non-obese patients. The effect of the treatments on lowering the blood pressure was compared in obese versus non-obese patients. The systolic response to CCBs, measured as at least a 10% reduction from the baseline, was significantly lower in the obese (12.5%) patients than in the non-obese (52.9%) ones. The differences in diastolic response (58.8 and 25% for non-obese and obese patients, respectively) did not reach significance. The percentage response to CCBs, however, was significantly less in the obese patients than in the non-obese patients for both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Corticosteroids also significantly influenced the response to CCBs in terms of diastolic pressure (62.9 and 25% for non-obese and obese patients, respectively). None of the tested covariates, including obesity, was found to significantly influence the response to ANGIs alone or in various combinations with CCBs. In conclusion, obesity and corticosteroid therapy should be considered when initiating antihypertensive drug treatment in children with kidney disease as both may contribute to a reduced efficacy of the antihypertensive therapy.", 
    "145": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduce clinical symptoms and improve outcome in patients with hypertension, heart failure, and stable coronary artery disease (CAD) and are among the most frequently used drugs in these patient groups. For hypertension, treatment is guided by the level of blood pressure. In the secondary prevention setting, there are no means of guiding therapy. Prior attempts to target ACE-inhibitors to those patients that are most likely to benefit have not been successful, mainly due to the consistency in the treatment effect in clinical subgroups. Still, for prolonged prophylactic treatment with ACE-inhibitors it would be best to target treatment to only those patients most likely to benefit, which would considerably lower the number needed to treat and increase cost-effectiveness. A new approach for such \"tailored-therapy\" may be to integrate information on the genetic variation between patients.

Blood tubes were received from patients at the beginning of the EUROPA trial and buffy coats were stored at -40 degrees C at the central core laboratory. Candidate genes were selected in the renin-angiotensin-system and bradykinin pathways. Polymorphisms were selected based on haplotype tagging principles using the HapMap genome project, Seattle and other up-to-date genetic database platforms to comprehensively cover all common genetic variation within the genes. Selection also took into consideration the functionality of SNP's, location within the gene (promoter) and existing relevant literature. The main outcome measure of PERGENE is the effect of genetic factors on the treatment benefit with ACE-inhibitors.

All the four tested ACE-I reduced endothelin-1 secretion and increased nitric oxide metabolite production by HUVECs. However, zofenoprilat (-42% after 8 hours of incubation) was more effective (P < .05) than enalaprilat (-25%), lisinopril (-21%), and captopril (-30%) in reducing endothelin-1 secretion.

We describe a case of 36 year-old man with CD associated with IgA nephropathy. He was diagnosed as CD 6 years ago and at that time, isolated proteinuria was observed. He presented recurrent proteinuria and elevation of creatinine level while he had been managed well with mesalamine and azathioprine. The renal biopsy was performed and IgA nephropathy (type IV) was diagnosed. Strict blood pressure control with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and calcium channel blocker resulted in clinical improvement and normalization of serum creatinine level.",

There are multiple risk factors and models that have been created to identify these people, yet there has not been a significant impact on outcomes or change in the therapies for these patients. The authors review the available therapies for patients with advanced heart failure and the various risk models available to predict morbidity and mortality and present simple \"office predictors\" that could be used to potentially predict patients who would benefit from these therapies.", 
    "199": "1. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) are hypotensive drugs that have been shown to prevent Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in high-risk individuals. However, in T2DM, the effects of ACEI on hepatic steatosis are not known. The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of ACEI on changes in liver histology and hepatic mRNA expression of adipokines in rats with T2DM. 2. Thirty-six rats were divided into a normal control group, a T2DM group and a fosinopril-treated group. After six weeks of treatment with 5 mg/kg per day fosinopril, an ACEI, changes in liver histology, serum fasting glucose (FG), insulin, triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, adiponectin were evaluated, as was hepatic TNF-alpha, IL-6 and adiponectin receptor-2 (adipoR2) mRNA expression. 3. The degree of hepatic steatosis and inflammation, serum FG, insulin, TG, TC, ALT, TNF-alpha and IL-6 concentrations and hepatic TNF-alpha and IL-6 mRNA expression were significantly higher in rats with T2DM than in normal controls. Serum adiponectin concentrations and hepatic adipoR2 mRNA expression in rats with T2DM were significantly lower than in normal controls. Fosinopril significantly reduced the degree of hepatic steatosis, serum FG, insulin, ALT, TNF-alpha and IL-6 concentrations and hepatic TNF-alpha and IL-6 mRNA expression. Fosinopril significantly increased serum adiponectin concentrations and hepatic adipoR2 mRNA expression. 4. In conclusion, the ACEI improved insulin sensitivity and hepatic steatosis in rats with T2DM by increasing circulating adiponectin and hepatic adipoR2 levels, in addition to reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in the circulation and liver.", 
    "200": "It has been noted in recommendations of the European Society of Hypertension (ESH) and of the European Society of Cardiology (2007) that there are no data on effects of antihypertensive therapy on risk of development of cardiovascular complications in patients older than 80 years. In the recently completed study HYVET on 3845 patients aged>80 years (mean age 83 years) with arterial pressure (AP)>160 mm Hg as criterion of inclusion, and target AP below 150/80 mm Hg at the background of 1.5 mg of indapamide retard with or without addition of 2-4 mg of perindopril, 30% lowering of risk of development of fatal and nonfatal stroke (95% confidence interval [CI] -1 to 51, p=0.06), 21% lowering of risk of all-cause death (95%CI 4 to 35, p=0.02), 23% lowering o f risk of cardiovascular death (95%CI -1 to 40, p=0.06), and 64% lowering of risk of development of heart failure (95%CI 42 to 78, p<0.001) were observed. Thus lowering of elevated AP in persons older than 80 years leads to substantial decrease of total mortality, rate of development of fatal stroke and heart failure, improvement of prognosis of life.", 
    "201": "Nowadays angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) are considered to be a cornerstone in the treatment of congestive heart failure (CHF). These agents have been shown to improve survival and functional status of patients with CHF. It is logical to start therapy with ACE-Is in the first hours or days of acute myocardial infarction (MI) to further improve survival and prevent CHF after MI. The several randomized placebo-controlled trials were performed to assess the effects of early therapy with ACE-Is on the outcomes of MI. Mortality after MI was significantly reduced only in these trials in which therapy with ACE-Is was introduced 3-16 days after MI in patients with clinical evidence of CHF or left ventricular systolic dysfunction as well as in patients with noneffective thrombolysis (or without thrombolysis) or diabetes mellitus.", 
    "202": "Premature aging (senescence) of endothelial cells might play an important role in the development and progression of hypertension and atherosclerosis. We hypothesized that bradykinin, a hormone that mediates vasoprotective effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, protects endothelial cells from oxidative stress-induced senescence. Bradykinin treatment (0.001 to 1 nmol/L) dose-dependently decreased senescence induced by 25 micromol/L of H(2)O(2) in cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells, as witnessed by a complete inhibition of increased senescent cell numbers and a 34% reduction of the levels of the senescence-associated cell cycle protein p21. Because H(2)O(2) induces senescence through superoxide-induced DNA damage, single-cell DNA damage was measured by comet assay. Bradykinin reduced DNA damage to control levels. The protective effect of bradykinin also resulted in a significant increase in the migration of H(2)O(2)-treated bovine aorta endothelial cells in an in vitro endothelial injury model, or \"scratch\" assay. The protective effect of bradykinin was abolished by the bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist HOE-140 and the NO production inhibitor N(omega)-methyl-L-arginine acetate salt. Therefore, we conclude that bradykinin protects endothelial cells from superoxide-induced senescence through bradykinin B2 receptor- and NO-mediated inhibition of DNA damage.", 
    "203": "We reported previously that urinary angiotensinogen (UAGT) levels provide a specific index of the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system (RAS) status in angiotensin II-dependent hypertensive rats. To study this system in humans, we recently developed a human angiotensinogen ELISA. To test the hypothesis that UAGT is increased in hypertensive patients, we recruited 110 adults. Four subjects with estimated glomerular filtration levels <30 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) were excluded because previous studies have already shown that UAGT is highly correlated with estimated glomerular filtration in this stage of chronic kidney disease. Consequently, 106 paired samples of urine and plasma were analyzed from 70 hypertensive patients (39 treated with RAS blockers [angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers; systolic blood pressure: 139+/-3 mm Hg] and 31 not treated with RAS blockers [systolic blood pressure: 151+/-4 mm Hg]) and 36 normotensive subjects (systolic blood pressure: 122+/-2 mm Hg). UAGT, normalized by urinary concentrations of creatinine, were not correlated with race, gender, age, height, body weight, body mass index, fractional excretion of sodium, plasma angiotensinogen levels, or estimated glomerular filtration. However, UAGT/urinary concentration of creatinine was significantly positively correlated with systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, urinary albumin:creatinine ratio (r=0.5994), and urinary protein:creatinine ratio (r=0.4597). UAGT/urinary concentration of creatinine was significantly greater in hypertensive patients not treated with RAS blockers (25.00+/-4.96 microg/g) compared with normotensive subjects (13.70+/-2.33 microg/g). Importantly, patients treated with RAS blockers exhibited a marked attenuation of this augmentation (13.26+/-2.60 microg/g). These data indicate that UAGT is increased in hypertensive patients, and treatment with RAS blockers suppresses UAGT, suggesting that the efficacy of RAS blockade to reduce the intrarenal RAS activity can be assessed by measurements of UAGT.", 
    "204": "The extent to which endogenous angiotensin (Ang) II formation is responsible for increasing kidney Ang II content and blood pressure during Ang II-induced hypertension is unknown. To address this, mice were treated with an Ang-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (ACEi) to block endogenous Ang II formation during chronic Ang II infusions. C57BL/6J male mice (8 to 12 weeks) were subjected to Ang II infusions (400 ng/kg per minute) with or without an ACEi (lisinopril, 100 mg/L in the drinking water) for 12 days. Blood pressure was monitored by tail-cuff method and telemetry. Ang II content was determined by radioimmunoanalysis. Ang II infusions increased 24-hour mean arterial pressure significantly (141.0+/-3.7 mm Hg) versus controls (110.0+/-1.0 mm Hg). ACEi prevented the increase in concentration in Ang II-infused mice (Ang II+ACEi; 114.0+/-7.4 mm Hg; P value not significant). Plasma Ang II content was significantly increased by Ang II (367+/-60 fmol/mL) versus controls (128+/-22 fmol/mL; P<0.05); plasma Ang II was not altered by ACEi alone (90+/-31) or in combination with Ang II infusions (76+/-27). Intrarenal Ang II content was significantly increased by Ang II (998+/-143 fmol/g) versus controls (524+/-60 fmol/g; P<0.05), and this was prevented by ACEi (Ang II+ACEi; 484+/-102 fmol/g; P value not significant). Thus, ACEi ameliorates the increases in blood pressure and intrarenal Ang II content caused by Ang II infusions, indicating that endogenous ACE-mediated Ang II formation plays a significant role in the increases of blood pressure and intrarenal Ang II during Ang II-induced hypertension.", 
    "205": "We tested the hypothesis that heart rate (HR) reduction, induced by the selective hyperpolarization-activated current inhibitor ivabradine (Iva), might improve left ventricular (LV) function, structure, and electrical remodeling in severe post-myocardial infarction (MI) chronic heart failure (HF). MI was produced in adult male Wistar rats. After 2 mo, echocardiography was performed before the randomization into MI and MI + Iva (10 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)) groups. After 3 mo of treatment, echocardiography and 24-h telemetry were recorded. Cardiac collagen, mRNA, and protein expressions of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and ANG II type 1 (AT(1)) receptor were quantified. As a result, at 2 mo post-MI, all rats displayed severe congestive HF signs (ejection fraction < 30%). At 5 mo post-MI, body and heart weights were similar in the MI and MI + Iva groups. LV ejection fraction and LV end-diastolic pressure were worsened in the MI group, whereas both were improved with Iva. Iva reduced HR by 10.4% (P < 0.03 vs. MI) and ventricular premature complexes by 89% (P < 0.03) and improved HR variability (standard deviation of the RR interval) by 22% (P < 0.05). There were no effects of Iva on PR, QRS, and QT durations. Interstitial fibrosis in the MI-remote LV was markedly reduced by Iva (4.0 +/- 0.1 vs. 1.8 +/- 0.1%, P < 0.005). Increases in ventricular gene and protein expressions of ACE and AT(1) receptor in MI were completely blunted by Iva. In conclusion, these data indicated that HR reduction by Iva prevents the worsening of LV dysfunction and remodeling that may be related to a downregulation of cardiac renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system transcripts. Such beneficial effects of Iva on cardiac remodeling open new clinical perspectives for the treatment of severe HF.", 
    "206": "Agonists and antagonists of G protein-coupled receptors are important drugs for the treatment of cardiovascular disease, but the therapeutic response of any given patient remains difficult to predict because of large interindividual variability. Among the factors potentially contributing to such variability, we have reviewed the evidence for a role of pharmacodynamic pharmacogenetics (i.e., polymorphisms in the cognate receptors for such drugs as well as other proteins potentially modifying their action). Based upon the availability of data and the prevalence of use, we have focused on ligands at adrenergic and angiotensin II receptors (including the indirectly acting angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors). The vast majority of gene polymorphisms reviewed here have shown only inconsistent effects on drug action, which does not make these polymorphisms useful genetic markers to predict treatment responses. We conclude that considerable additional research, partly involving other types of study than those available now, will be necessary to allow a definitive judgment whether pharmacodynamic pharmacogenetic markers are useful in an individualized approach to cardiovascular therapy. Moreover, we predict that even such additional research will result in only few cases where the promise of tailored treatment can be fulfilled; however, some of these few cases may be of major clinical relevance.", 
    "207": "Absence of connexin 40 (Cx40) leads to ectopic juxtaglomerular renin expression and abrogates recruitment of renin-expressing cells in the adult kidney but does not disturb renin expression during kidney development. To find an explanation for these observations, we aimed to analyze the expression pattern of major vascular Cxs in normal juxtaglomerular epithelioid cells, in recruited renin-expressing cells, and in fetal renin-expressing cells. We found that during kidney development, the appearance of renin-producing cells paralleled the expression of Cx40 and, to a lesser extent, Cx45 but not other Cxs. In the adult kidney, juxtaglomerular epithelioid cells expressed Cx40 and lesser amounts of Cx37 and Cx43 but not Cx45, which localized to arteriolar smooth muscle cells. Recruitment of renin-producing cells in adult kidneys in response to long-term salt deprivation of mice correlated with the reappearance of only Cx40. Cx40-null renin-producing cells did not express Cx37, Cx43, or Cx45. These findings suggest that Cx40 expression is a characteristic of renin-producing cells in the kidney, and it seems to be essential in the recruitment of renin-producing cells in the adult but not the fetal kidney.",

Although the perioperative experience of high-risk CABG patients has been studied extensively, little attention has been paid to low-risk CABG patients.

Blood product transfusion (P < .01), postoperative length of intensive care unit stay (P = .01), and length of hospital stay (P = .05) were all significantly increased in the readmitted patients. The use of beta-blockers (P = .03) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (P = .04) was significantly lower at discharge in this group of patients; however, multivariate regression analysis demonstrated diabetes (odds ratio, 1.59; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-2.42) to be the only independent predictor of early readmission.",

Most of these polymorphisms are mainly associated with conditions such as venous thromboembolism and atherothrombosis, and their prevalence has not been studied yet in Greece. We tested 140 healthy individuals for factor V (FV)1691G/A, FV4070G/A, FII 20210G/A, factor XIII (FXIII) exon 2G/T, fibrinogen beta-455G/A, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1)-675 4G/5G, human platelet antigens 1 (HPA1) a/b, apolipoprotein B (ApoB) 10708 G/A, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) E2, E3, and E4, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) D/I, 5,10 methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) 677C/T, and MTHFR 1298A/C polymorphisms using a PCR and reverse hybridization technique that detects all of them simultaneously. The allele frequencies observed are in accordance with those reported in other Caucasian populations and almost identical to those of East Mediterranean populations. This first report from Greece may serve as a baseline for planning further investigations of these polymorphisms in association with several clinical entities and for launching guidelines for patient testing of various disease settings in this population.",

The integral indicator of clinical symptoms fell down from 12.54 +/- 0.27 to 9.26 +/- 0.22 by the 12th month of therapy.

    "215": "Acute coronary syndromes (ACSs) are the most common cause of hospital admission in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). The term ACS refers to a spectrum of acute life-threatening disorders that includes: unstable angina (UA), non ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The pathophysiology is similar: coronary atherosclerosis plaque rupture and subsequent thrombus formation. Such plaques usually are lesions with <50% stenosis severity prior to ACS, but are lipid-rich soft plaques (vulnerable plaques). The clinical presentation depends on the degree of partial (UA/NSTEMI) or complete lumen obstruction of the culprit coronary artery (STEMI). This article reviews the UA/NSTEMI ACS, since these two entities are closely related and usually, it is not possible to distinguish them upon presentation at the emergency department (ED). It presents the latest advancement on the pathophysiology, clinical presentations, diagnosis, risk stratification and management. It emphasizes on the selection of the optimal management approach which includes early invasive versus initial conservative strategies. Besides, it discusses the different approaches being used in the light of the information provided by the latest clinical trials. Although, at the present time, the optimal management approach remains unsettled, ACSs are usually managed using an early invasive strategy in tertiary care hospitals in the USA. The application of clinical practice guidelines developed by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) has confirmed definite improvement of patient care. Part of the information presented in this article, particularly in its management, is based on these guidelines (3). Evidence base scientific data insists upon using aggressive medical therapy (statins, anti-platelets, beta blockers [BBs], angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors [ACE-Is], and control of coronary risk factors) as well as mechanical reperfusion, whether by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or by coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). These approaches are considered complementary rather than as opposing strategies.", 
    "216": "Hypertension is a common comorbidity in patients with diabetes, and adequate control of blood pressure significantly reduces the risk of macrovascular and microvascular complications. Patients with diabetes should achieve a target blood pressure of less than 130/80 mm Hg. The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may slow progression to kidney failure and cardiovascular mortality; these agents are the preferred therapy for managing coexisting diabetes and hypertension. Angiotensin receptor blockers can prevent progression of diabetic kidney disease and are a first-line alternative for patients intolerant of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Thiazide diuretics provide additional antihypertensive effects when combined with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. With lower doses of these drugs, the risk of clinically significant metabolic alterations is minimal. Beta blockers and calcium channel blockers also have beneficial effects in managing hypertension in patients with diabetes. Beta blockers reduce cardiovascular events and are useful in a multidrug regimen. Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers should be reserved for patients intolerant of preferred agents or those who need additional therapy to achieve target blood pressure. Many patients with diabetes require combination therapy with multiple antihypertensive agents.",

    "218": "Only a few studies have evaluated the effectiveness of treatment in IgAN patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) and most of these had methodological flaws. However, some studies produced interesting results. Alexopoulos and Donadio found that the progression of IgAN slowed down with the use of omega-3 fatty acids; Woo and Nakao used angiotensin inhibitors to obtain the same result, while Ballardie used immunosuppressors. Evidence of treatment efficacy in chronic histological lesions is almost completely lacking. Yoshikawa found that a two-year course of corticosteroids and azathioprine could arrest the progression of glomerular sclerosis, and Shoji obtained similar results using corticosteroids alone for one year. In 2007 we presented the results of a study that compared corticosteroids alone vs corticosteroids and azathioprine in 253 IgAN patients. In all patients, including 46 with serum creatinine >2 mg/dL, both therapy schemes appeared effective in slowing the progression towards ESRD, even if patients in the azathioprine group experienced more side effects.",

It is a complex, heterogeneous phenomenon with multiple cellular and biochemical mechanisms and different morphological patterns, depending on a variety of local and systemic factors. The term as such does not indicate the quantity nor the type of components of the deposited matrix. The amount of extracellular matrix increases in three types of events: - matrix deposition in areas that were destroyed by a necrotizing process (scars following glomerular necrosis); - matrix deposition in glomerular regions where matrix is normally found (mesangium, glomerular basement membranes) as seen in diabetic nephropathy; - matrix deposition inside or around collapsing capillaries involving the entire glomerulus or a segment of it (focal segmental glomerular sclerosis with nephrotic syndrome). Knowledge of the diverse morphological patterns producing glomerular sclerosis and the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved is essential for obvious reasons: they represent the rationale for any therapy aimed at preventing or reducing the progression of sclerosis and can provide a starting point to determine which forms are, at least potentially, reversible.",

Peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients rarely develop EPS, a severe life-threatening condition of unknown pathogenesis. Angiotensin II is known to promote fibrosis and inflammation in various tissues. Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockade provides advantages in the course of diseases such as hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and proteinuria. We have also previously shown that RAS blockade has beneficial effects on hypertonic (3.86%) PD solution-induced peritoneal alterations.

Peritoneal rest had some beneficial effect only on UF failure and dialysate cell count (p < 0.05). However, RAS blockade was more effective than peritoneal rest with respect to UF volume, vascularity (p < 0.05), and peritoneal thickness (p > 0.05). Dual blockade of RAS had no additional beneficial effects.",

    "227": "Twenty-eight dogs were assigned to the following treatment groups; rapid ventricular pacing (HF group; n=10), concomitant ACE inhibitor and rapid pacing (enalapril 1.9 mg/kg/day: ACEI group; n=8), or sham-operated control (control group; n=10). After 4 weeks of pacing, cardiac function was evaluated using micromanometers and conductance catheters. We used indexes to quantify the temporal and spatial aspects of mechanical dyssynchrony derived from online segmental conductance catheter signals. At each time point, a segmental signal was defined as dyssynchronous if its change was opposite to the simultaneous change in the total LV volume. Mechanical dyssynchrony was calculated as the mean of the segmental dyssynchronies during systole, diastole, and throughout the cardiac cycle.",

The mechanical dyssynchrony index in the HF group was significantly higher compared to that of the control group, while it was significantly lower in the ACEI group. Thus, conventional therapy with an ACE inhibitor diminished LV dyssynchrony during the progression of pacing-induced HF.",

One drug that emerged from this effort is aliskiren, a direct human renin inhibitor that blocks the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I (Ang I). In contrast to other antihypertensive agents, aliskiren decreases plasma renin activity (PRA). In healthy human subjects, doses of between 40 and 640 mg of aliskiren exert a dose-dependent reduction in PRA and Ang I and Ang II levels. The bioavailability of aliskiren is low (2%), peak plasma concentrations are reached within one to three hours and the binding with plasma proteins achieves approximately 47-51%. Aliskiren is slightly metabolized (20%) by CYP3A4. The most common adverse events include diarrhea, headache, back pain and gastrointestinal disorders. Aliskiren is well tolerated, and may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents. Aliskiren belongs to a new class of agents that effectively and specifically inhibit the RAS. This drug functions through a novel mechanism of action and has the potential to become a true alternative to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers in the therapy of hypertension and other cardiovascular and renal disorders.", 
    "234": "Although achieving blood pressure (BP) control is critical to improve cardiovascular prognosis in hypertensive patients, many of them fail to achieve BP goals. The majority of hypertensive patients need more than one antihypertensive agent to attain BP targets. Combination therapy is required when monotherapy fails to attain BP objectives and as a first-line treatment in certain situations, such as markedly elevated BP values, when lower targets are required in high or very high cardiovascular risk patients. The advantages of combination therapy are well documented, with an increased antihypertensive efficacy as a result of the simultaneous inhibition of different mechanisms of action and with a lesser incidence of adverse events, because of the possible compensatory responses and the lower doses used. Calcium channel blockers are effective drugs in the treatment of hypertension. The efficacy of lercanidipine has been evaluated in several noncomparative and in comparative studies showing a great efficacy with a good tolerability. On the other hand, the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system appears to be very beneficial in the treatment of patients with hypertension. Enalapril is an effective and well tolerated angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor.

Conversely, experience in providing sexual health screening to men with CHD is lacking. The purpose of this study was to identify sexual health issues in men with CHD. An anonymous survey was distributed to men in our adult CHD clinic. Age, type of CHD, medications, detailed sexual history including cardiovascular symptoms with intercourse, erectile dysfunction (ED), and willingness to discuss ED with a physician was obtained. A logistic regression analysis was performed to analyze the relation between medications, CHD complexity, and ED; 86 men completed the survey with a mean age of 34 +/- 10 years. The prevalence of ED was 38%. Men were treated with cardiac medications including beta blockers (BB; 24%), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (8%), calcium-channel blockers (6%), and combination BB and ACE inhibitor therapy (16%). Men on BB were 3.13 times more likely to report ED (p = 0.045). Complexity of CHD did not increase the likelihood of ED symptoms (p >0.10). Although most men attributed symptoms to their underlying CHD, most were willing to discuss issues of ED with their cardiologist. In conclusion, ED is prevalent in young men with CHD.

However, the relation between guideline adherence and heart failure hospital length of stay (LOS) has not been well studied. Whether quality of care delivered to patients with heart failure is impacted on by hospital LOS was assessed. Data were analyzed from 209 hospitals participating in the Get With the Guidelines heart failure program. From January 2005 to September 2006, a total of 36,078 admissions were recorded and stratified by a median heart failure hospitalization LOS of <5 or >or=5 days. Comparisons of baseline patient characteristics and quality measures were analyzed using generalized estimating equations. Patients with LOS >or=5 days were slightly older, more likely to be seen at a larger hospital, and had higher ejection fractions and increased rates of such co-morbidities as diabetes, anemia, renal insufficiency, and pulmonary disease. After adjustment, longer LOS was associated with an increased odds ratio (OR) per each additional day for providing discharge instructions (OR 1.027, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.017 to 1.038) and left ventricular ejection fraction documentation (OR 1.049, 95% CI 1.031 to 1.067). However, LOS >or=5 days was independently associated with modestly decreased use of life-prolonging medications at hospital discharge for patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (OR 0.977, 95% CI 0.967 to 0.987) and beta blockers (OR 0.990, 95% CI 0.982 to 0.997). In conclusion, in Get With the Guidelines participating institutions, hospital LOS had only a modest influence on quality-of-care measures. Overall, excellent adherence to guideline-based medical therapy was observed, even in patients with a shorter hospital LOS.",

PK/PBAN analogs incorporating beta-amino acids were synthesized and evaluated in a pheromonotropic assay in Heliothis peltigera, a melanotropic assay in Spodoptera littoralis, a pupariation assay in Neobellieria bullata, and a hindgut contractile assay in Leucophaea maderae. Two analogs (PK-betaA-1 and PK-betaA-4) demonstrate greatly enhanced resistance to the peptidases neprilysin and angiotensin converting enzyme that are shown to degrade the natural peptides. Despite the changes to the PK core, analog PK-betaA-4 represents a biostable, non-selective agonist in all four bioassays, essentially matching the potency of a natural PK in pupariation assay. Analog PK-betaA-2 is a potent agonist in the melanotropic assay, demonstrating full efficacy at 1pmol. In some cases, the structural changes imparted to the analogs modify the physiological responses. Analog PK-betaA-3 is a non-selective agonist in all four bioassays. The analog PK-betaA-1 shows greater selectivity than parent PK peptides; it is virtually inactive in the pupariation assay and represents a biostable antagonist in the pheromonotropic and melanotropic assays, without the significant agonism of the parent hexapeptide. These analogs provide new, and in some cases, biostable tools to endocrinologists studying similarities and differences in the mechanisms of the variety of PK/PBAN mediated physiological processes. They also may provide leads in the development of PK/PBAN-based, insect-specific pest management agents.",

Kinetic studies with SRI indicated partial noncompetitive inhibition, with a K(i) value of 37.5 microM. On the other hand, SRI weakly inhibited pepsin, papain, and bromeline activities, but did not inhibit other proteinases, such as trypsin, kallikrein, angiotensin converting enzyme, and aminopeptidase M.

We found that: (1) compared with WT mice, B(1)R(-/-) mice that underwent sham surgery had slightly but significantly increased left ventricular (LV) diastolic dimension, LV mass and myocyte size, whereas systolic blood pressure, cardiac function and collagen deposition did not differ between strains; (2) MI leads to LV hypertrophy, chamber dilatation and dysfunction similarly in both WT and B(1)R(-/-) mice; and (3) ACEi and ARB improved cardiac function and remodelling in both strains; however, these benefits were significantly diminished in B(1)R(-/-) mice.

There is increasing evidence that inflammation and fibrosis may play a major role in the initiation and maintenance of AF. Statins by means of their pleotropic effects and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers by preventing atrial remodelling may prove useful in preventing the development of AF. However, there is insufficient evidence to expand the use of these agents to a wider patient population at risk of AF. It needs to be seen if strategies towards primary and secondary prevention with treatment of underlying heart disease and modification of risk factors have a larger effect than specific interventions in preventing the burden of AF in the general population.",

None of these effects were seen with ADMA. Depletion of the intracellular stores with thapsigargin in the absence of Ca2+(ex), followed by re-addition of Ca2+(ex) triggered a significantly larger Ca2+ entry after SDMA treatment versus saline.

Six-week-old male Wistar rats were injected intraperitoneally with monocrotaline (60 mg/kg) or saline. The rats were administrated captopril (30 mg/kg per day) or a vehicle orally for 24 days from the day of monocrotaline injection. At day 25, echocardiography was performed and hearts were excised. Expressions and activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were measured by Western blotting and by gelatin zymography, respectively. In monocrotaline-injected rats, right ventricular weight/tail length ratio increased significantly. Histological analysis revealed cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and fibrosis in right ventricular sections. Echocardiography showed right ventricular dysfunction compared with saline-injected rats. The right ventricular hypertrophy, fibrosis, and dysfunction were inhibited by captopril. However, captopril did not attenuate an increase in pulmonary artery pressure. MMP-2 and MMP-9 expressions and activities in right ventricles increased significantly in monocrotaline-injected rats and captopril inhibited them. These findings indicate that captopril attenuates the development of monocrotaline-induced right ventricular hypertrophy in association with inhibition of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in rats.",

To determine which pathway, angiotensin-converting enzyme or nonangiotensin-converting enzyme angiotensin-generating enzyme/chymase, might be involved in preeclampsia conditioned medium induced angiotensin II generation, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril and chymotrypsin inhibitors were applied to the cell culture either separately or in combination. We found that chymotrypsin inhibitor, but not captopril, could attenuate the increased angiotensin II generation. To further test specific effects of the protease on endothelial cell angiotensin II generation, endothelial cells were grown in cell culture inserts and chymotrypsin was added to the upper chamber of the cell culture (apical exposure). The medium in the lower chamber (basal direction) was collected and measured for angiotensin II. Our results showed that apical exposure of endothelial cells to the protease resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in basal release of angiotensin II. Angiotensin II receptor-1 expression was also upregulated in cells treated with preeclampsia conditioned medium or chymotrypsin. This data suggest that placenta-derived factors may activate chymase-angiotensin pathway in endothelial cells. Moreover, increased endothelial cell basal release of angiotensin II in response to the protease stimulation further suggests that angiotensin II levels in the circulation may not necessarily reflect angiotensin II generation within the vascular wall.",

First, 16-week-old male spontaneously hypertensive rats (n=60) were pulse treated for 2 weeks with high-dose angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril), angiotensin receptor blocker (candesartan), calcium channel blocker (nifedipine), or vasodilator (hydralazine) with or without salt restriction, and the long-term effects on blood pressure were examined. Second, spontaneously hypertensive rats were treated with angiotensin receptor blocker or calcium channel blocker, and the effects on renal gene expressions, arteriolar structure, and vascular matrix metalloproteinase were compared. Treatment of spontaneously hypertensive rats with different antihypertensive agents caused apparently similar reductions in blood pressure during the course of the pulse treatment, within the limitations of the tail-cuff method. After cessation of medications, blood pressure in the rats treated with renin-angiotensin system inhibitor remained reduced by >30 to 40 mm Hg for 4 months. No such effect was seen with calcium channel blocker or vasodilator. The 2-week angiotensin receptor blocker treatment induced a marked reversal of the arteriolar hypertrophy specifically in the small (30 to 100 microm) renal arterioles, together with increased expression and activity of matrix metalloproteinase-13.

This article reviews the most valid and recent evidence available concerning the use of ACEIs in HF due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction. The administration of ACEIs leads to statistically and clinically significant reductions in mortality (20 to 23%), risk of myocardial infarction (20 to 21%), hospitalization for heart failure (33%) and symptoms (as measured by NYHA classification). The existence of a class effect has been suggested for ACEIs. However, it has not been possible to demonstrate a significant effect on mortality in subgroup analysis for females or blacks. Higher doses of ACEIs are associated with a significant reduction in the combined endpoint of death or hospitalization for any reason and fewer hospitalizations for heart failure, but not in mortality risk or improvement as measured by NYHA class. All patients with HF should be prescribed an ACEI except in cases of contraindication or adverse reactions.",

The degree of cardiac symptoms did not differ between the 2 groups; however, no difference was found between the 2 groups in the mortality rate (P=0.898), and readmission rates (P=0.674). The results of a multivariate analysis using a Cox proportional hazards model to identify predictors of the prognosis of heart failure revealed no difference in prognosis according to the presence/absence of decreased LVEF, whereas renal dysfunction and anemia were identified as significant prognostic determinants. Also, in the reduced group, the administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) and/or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), beta-blockers reduced mortality. In the preserved group, ACE-I and/or ARB administration reduced mortality, whereas beta-blockers did not.",

Both treatments significantly reduced blood pressure in all subgroups, but the metabolic effects of carvedilol were more beneficial in subgroups of race and sex. Carvedilol did not affect hemoglobin A(1c) but improved HOMA-IR results in all subgroups, significantly in males and \"other race\" subgroups. Metoprolol significantly increased hemoglobin A(1c) in all subgroups except \"other race,\" with no effect on HOMA-IR findings.

They were prospective followed annually thereafter and we present herein the most important results concerning survival figures and CVD at four years. Mean recipient age was 49.7+/-13.7 years: 16% retransplanted and 12.5% hyperimmunized. Tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and steroids was used in 63%. Acute rejection (AR) rate at 1 year was 14.8%. Graft and patient survival at 48 months were 85.6% (death censored) and 91.7% respectively. The first cause of graft loss was vascular in the first year, death with function during the 2-3 years, and chronic allograft nephropathy at the 4th year. Donor age, time on dialysis, acute tubular necrosis (ATN), AR, SCr at 6 months, the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers in the first year, and systolic blood pressure at 24 months were independent risk factors for graft loss at 4th year. The first cause of death was CVD (predominantly ischemic heart disease (IHD) in the first year). Recipient age, ATN, and SCr at 6 months were independent predictors of mortality. Despite worsening of donor age, comorbidity, and advanced age of recipients, survival figures at four years are considered good in our Spanish non-selected population. Cardiovascular mortality is the most important cause of death and graft loss particularly, IHD in the first year.

Since renal disease is the strongest risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, strategies able to reduce renal disease progression are expected to translate into a decreased incidence of cardiovascular events. To this purpose, inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system, both by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists, represents the best available option. Several large, randomized studies have convincingly shown that these treatments are associated with a significant reduction in the risk for renal disease progression in diabetic and non diabetic patients with chronic kidney disease. Importantly, improvement of renal outcomes is paralleled by a reduction of the cardiovascular risk. However, a significant proportion of patients with chronic nephropathies still progresses to end-stage renal failure or dies for cardiovascular events. A more complex strategy, including strict control of BP and proteinuria, lowering of blood lipids, tight metabolic control of diabetes, and lifestyle changes may improve morbidity and mortality of patients with chronic renal disease as compared with single or dual intervention on the renin-angiotensin system. Moreover, prevention strategies are urgently needed to face the burden of chronic renal disease and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

However, B1 agonism has no effect on vasomotor or fibrinolytic function. Findings from transgenic animals lacking the B2 receptor suggest that these conflicting data may be explained by cross-talk between B1 and B2 receptors. We hypothesized that B1 stimulation causes vasodilatation and tissue plasminogen activator release in the human forearm when B2 receptor signaling is inhibited. Forearm blood flow was measured in 16 patients with heart failure receiving ACEi. In double-blinded crossover studies, intrabrachial Lys-[Leu8]-des-Arg9-bradykinin (B1 antagonist), lys-des-Arg9-bradykinin (B1 agonist), bradykinin (B2 agonist), and sodium nitroprusside (endothelium-independent vasodilator) were infused alone or with HOE-140 (B2 antagonist). HOE-140 did not affect basal vascular tone or t-PA release, but it abolished bradykinin-induced vasodilatation and t-PA release (P < 0.0001).

Whether leptin is the sole mechanism mediating autonomic imbalance and hypertension is unclear. To explore this notion further, we measured BP by radiotelemetry combined with fast Fourier transformation and assessed autonomic function pharmacologically before and after renin-angiotensin system blockade with enalapril. The resting period BP (117+/-3 versus 108+/-1.0 mm Hg) and heart rate (HR; 488+/-12 versus 436+/-8 bpm) were higher in db/db mice compared with db/+ mice. BP and HR amplitudes were lower in db/db mice compared with db/+ mice. BP response to trimetaphan (-43+/-5 versus -27+/-3 mm Hg) and HR response to metoprolol (-59+/-12 versus -5+/-4 bpm) were greater in db/db mice than in db/+ mice. The HR response to atropine was blunted in db/db mice (59+/-17 versus 144+/-24 bpm), as were baroreflex sensitivity and HR variability. Enalapril improved autonomic regulation in db/db mice. Stimulation of central alpha-2 adrenoreceptors enhanced both parasympathetic HR control and baroreflex sensitivity in db/db mice. We suggest that functional, rather than structural, alpha-2 adrenoceptor changes and the renin-angiotensin system are involved in the increased sympathetic and decreased parasympathetic tones in db/db mice. Our data suggest that db/db mice exhibit features found in humans with type 2 diabetic autonomic neuropathy and could serve as a model for this complication.", 
    "423": "We tested the hypothesis that transient receptor potential canonical type 3 (TRPC3) channels are increased in vascular smooth muscle cells and aortic tissue from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) compared with normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats. Expression of TRPC3 was analyzed by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. TRPC3 gene knockdown was performed by specific small interfering RNA and TRPC3 overexpression using the pAdEasy-1 system. Cytosolic calcium was measured using fluorescence spectrophotometry and vasoconstriction of aortic rings using a force transducer. In SHR, the expression of TRPC3 channel protein was significantly higher in aortic rings (1.48+/-0.05 versus 1.00+/-0.06; each n=6; P<0.01) and vascular smooth muscle cells (1.28+/-0.08 versus 1.00+/-0.03; each n=6; P<0.05) compared with Wistar Kyoto rats. Knockdown of TRPC3 gene expression by specific small interfering RNA significantly reduced the angiotensin II-induced calcium influx by 30+/-3% (n=6; P<0.01), whereas TRPC3 overexpression significantly increased it by 55+/-3% (n=6; P<0.01). The angiotensin II-induced calcium increase was significantly enhanced in vascular smooth muscle cells from SHR compared with Wistar Kyoto rats, even in the presence of the calcium channel blocker amlodipine. Angiotensin II significantly elevated the TRPC3 channel protein expression in vascular smooth muscle cells from SHR from 1.28+/-0.08 to 1.61+/-0.08 (each n=6; P<0.01). Angiotensin II-induced TRPC3 expression was prevented by telmisartan. Administration of telmisartan to SHR for 4 weeks significantly reduced blood pressure, angiotensin II-induced vasoconstriction, and TRPC3 channel protein expression in aortic tissue. TRPC3 expression was not significantly reduced after reduction of blood pressure in SHR using amlodipine.

All patients were receiving \u2264 half target dose of ACE inhibitor as background therapy. 44 patients received an increase in their background ACE inhibitor while 45 patients were given irbesartan (target dose 300 mg/day) in addition to their background ACE inhibitor. The primary end-point was change in brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) from baseline to 6 months. Change in hs-CRP level, 6 min walk distance, and Minnesota living with heart failure quality of life questionnaire (MLWHF) from baseline to 6 months were also evaluated. Patients were well matched at baseline for all end-point parameters as well as for age, gender and baseline systolic ventricular function. There was general improvement in clinical status for all patients but no significant difference between increased ACE inhibitor vs added ARB for change in BNP, hs-CRP, NYHA, 6 min walk or MLWHF (all P>0.05). This PROBE study has demonstrated similar clinical responses with increased dose of ACE inhibitor compared to addition of ARB in patients with systolic CHF.

The most typical form of cardiotoxicity, a dilated cardiomyopathy (CMP), usually becomes manifest late in the course of the disease and is classically considered to be refractory to therapy. Preventing cardiotoxicity remains the most important strategy, and several measures have been proposed, including cardiac function monitoring, limitation of CT dose, use of anthracycline analogues and cardioprotectants, and early detection of cardiotoxicity by biomarkers. The response to modern heart failure therapy of CT-induced CMP has never been evaluated in clinical trials, and no definite guidelines have been adopted. Although it is likely that medications used for other forms of CMP, particularly angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers, may be highly effective, there is still some unjustified concern regarding their use in cancer patients.", 
    "428": "In the decade since the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene was first proposed to be a 'human gene for physical performance', there have been numerous studies examining the effects of ACE genotype on physical performance phenotypes such as aerobic capacity, muscle function, trainability, and athletic status. While the results are variable and sometimes inconsistent, and corroborating phenotypic data limited, carriers of the ACE 'insertion' allele (the presence of an alu repeat element in intron 16 of the gene) have been reported to have higher maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max), greater response to training, and increased muscle efficiency when compared with individuals carrying the 'deletion' allele (absence of the alu repeat). Furthermore, the insertion allele has been reported to be over-represented in elite athletes from a variety of populations representing a number of endurance sports. The mechanism by which the ACE insertion genotype could potentiate physical performance is unknown. The presence of the ACE insertion allele has been associated with lower ACE activity (ACEplasma) in number of studies, suggesting that individuals with an innate tendency to have lower ACE levels respond better to training and are at an advantage in endurance sporting events. This could be due to lower levels of angiotensin II (the vasoconstrictor converted to active form by ACE), higher levels of bradykinin (a vasodilator degraded by ACE) or some combination of the two phenotypes. Observations that individuals carrying the ACE insertion allele (and presumably lower ACEplasma) have an enhanced response to training or are over-represented amongst elite athletes raises the intriguing question: would individuals with artificially lowered ACEplasma have similar training or performance potential? As there are a number of drugs (i.e. ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists [angiotensin receptor blockers--ARBs]) that have the ability to either reduce ACEplasma activity or block the action of angiotensin II, the question is relevant to the study of ergogenic agents and to the efforts to rid sports of 'doping'. This article discusses the possibility that ACE inhibitors and ARBs, by virtue of their effects on ACE or angiotensin II function, respectively, have performance-enhancing capabilities; it also reviews the data on the effects of these medications on VO2max, muscle composition and endurance capacity in patient and non-patient populations. We conclude that, while the direct evidence supporting the hypothesis that ACE-related medications are potential doping agents is not compelling, there are insufficient data on young, athletic populations to exclude the possibility, and there is ample, albeit indirect, support from genetic studies to suggest that they should be. Unfortunately, given the history of drug experimentation in athletes and the rapid appropriation of therapeutic agents into the doping arsenal, this indirect evidence, coupled with the availability of ACE-inhibiting and ACE-receptor blocking medications may be sufficiently tempting to unscrupulous competitors looking for a shortcut to the finish line.",

ACE inhibitors have not consistently shown survival benefits in either the single RCT or observational studies. beta-Blockers showed mortality benefit in only 1 large cohort study plus an RCT of patients with congestive heart failure, but results were not duplicated in other studies; the magnitude of beta-blocker benefit after myocardial infarction was similar in dialysis and nondialysis individuals in another study.

    "443": "Resistant hypertension is defined as failure to achieve goal blood pressure (BP) when a patient adheres to the maximum tolerated doses of 3 antihypertensive drugs including a diuretic. Although the exact prevalence of resistant hypertension is currently unknown, indirect evidence from population studies and clinical trials suggests that it is a relatively common clinical problem. The prevalence of resistant hypertension is projected to increase, owing to the aging population and increasing trends in obesity, sleep apnea, and chronic kidney disease. Management of resistant hypertension must begin with a careful evaluation of the patient to confirm the diagnosis and exclude factors associated with \"pseudo-resistance,\" such as improper BP measurement technique, the white-coat effect, and poor patient adherence to life-style and/or antihypertensive medications. Education and reinforcement of life-style issues that affect BP, such as sodium restriction, reduction of alcohol intake, and weight loss if obese, are critical in treating resistant hypertension. Exclusion of preparations that contribute to true BP treatment resistance, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, cold preparations, and certain herbs, is also important. Lastly, BP control can only be achieved if an antihypertensive treatment regimen is used that focuses on the genesis of the hypertension. An example is volume overload, a common but unappreciated cause of treatment resistance. Use of the appropriate dose and type of diuretic provides a solution to overcome treatment resistance in this instance.",

Both ACE and ACE2 have catalytic activity that is chloride sensitive and is caused by the presence of the CL1 and CL2 chloride-binding sites in ACE and the CL1 site in ACE2. The chloride regulation of activity is also substrate dependent. Site-directed mutagenesis was employed to elucidate which of the CL1 and CL2 site residues are responsible for chloride sensitivity. The CL1 site residues Arg186, Trp279 and Arg489 of testicular ACE and the equivalent ACE2 residues Arg169, Trp271 and Lys481 were found to be critical to chloride sensitivity. Arg522 of testicular ACE was also confirmed to be vital to the chloride regulation mediated by the CL2 site. In addition, Arg514 of ACE2 was identified as a residue critical to substrate selectivity, with the R514Q mutant, relative to the wild-type, possessing a fourfold greater selectivity for the formation of the vasodilator angiotensin-(1-7) from the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II. The enhancement of angiotensin II cleavage by R514Q ACE2 was a result of a 2.5-fold increase in V(max) compared with the wild-type. Inhibition of ACE2 was also found to be chloride sensitive, as for testicular ACE, with residues Arg169 and Arg514 of ACE2 identified as influencing the potency of the ACE2-specific inhibitor MLN-4760. Consequently, important insights into the chloride sensitivity, substrate selectivity and inhibition of testicular ACE and ACE2 were elucidated.",

    "452": "Mechanisms of postoperative AF are likely to be multifactorial and are influenced by preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative factors including a genetic basis. Electrical remodelling is thought to be related to the generation of reactive oxidant species and inflammatory factors during the ischemia-reperfusion phase of cardiac surgery. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase was found to be the primary source of superoxide within the human atrial myocardium (in patients in sinus rhythm and in those with AF) and linked with paroxysmal and chronic AF. Reactive oxidant species cause lipid peroxidation, breakdown of cell membrane, decreased mitochondrial function, calcium overload and apoptosis. This affect was shown to be reversed by exogenous nitric oxide/donors (sodium nitroprusside). Inflammatory factors such as the rise in white blood cell count, C-reactive proteins were implicated in the pathogenesis of AF. In contrast, new evidence identifies statins as having both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and that their use reduces the incidence of postoperative AF (57% in the control vs. 35% in the atorvastatin group). Other antiinflammatory strategies include steroids with one study showing postoperative AF occurred in 21% in the steroid group compared with 51% in the placebo group although their use resulted in an increase in other complications. The mainstay of therapy however, remains to be beta-blockers alone which impart a modest influence on overall rates of AF with a reduction from 33.7 to 16.9% (OR: 0.37, 95% CI: 0.29-0.48).

    "455": "Left ventricular (LV) remodelling remains an important treatment target in patients after myocardial infarction (MI) and chronic heart failure (CHF). Accumulating evidence has supported the concept that beneficial effects of current pharmacological treatment strategies to improve the prognosis in these patients, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition, angiotensin type 1 receptor blocker therapy, and beta-blocker therapy, are related, at least in part, to their effects on LV remodelling and dysfunction. However, despite modern reperfusion therapy after MI and optimized treatment of patients with CHF, LV remodelling is observed in a substantial proportion of patients and is associated with an adverse clinical outcome. These observations call for novel therapeutic strategies to prevent or even reverse cardiac remodelling. Recent insights from experimental studies have provided new targets for interventions to prevent or reverse LV remodelling, i.e. reduced endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase-derived NO availability, activation of cardiac and leukocyte-dependent oxidant stress pathways, inflammatory pathway activation, matrix-metalloproteinase activation, or stem cell transfer and delivery of novel paracrine factors. An important challenge in translating these observations from preclinical studies into clinical treatment strategies relates to the fact that clinical studies are designed on top of established pharmacological therapy, whereas most experimental studies have tested novel interventions without concomitant drug regimens such as ACE inhibitors or beta-blockers. Therefore, animal studies may overestimate the effect of potential novel treatment strategies on LV remodelling and dysfunction, since established pharmacological therapies may act, in part, via identical or similar signalling pathways. Nevertheless, preclinical studies provide essential information for identifying potential novel targets, and their potential drawbacks, and are required for developing novel clinical treatment strategies to prevent or reverse LV remodelling and dysfunction.",

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of benazepril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), on the formation of AGE, the expression RAGE and other associated components in the oxidative stress pathway in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). 2. Groups of SHR were treated with or without 10 mg/kg per day benazepril for 12 weeks. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and angiotensin (Ang) II levels were evaluated in SHR and control Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. Renal function was investigated by determining levels of proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis. Furthermore, reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the rat renal cortex were analysed using an H(2)O(2)-based hydroxyl radical-detection assay and the renal content of AGE, RAGE, NADPH oxidase p47phox, nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB p65, phosphorylated (p-) NF-kappaB p65, vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 was determined by immunohistochemistry, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis. 3. Treatment with benazepril inhibited the formation of AngII, reduced SBP and alleviated renal lesions in SHR compared with both untreated SHR and control WKY rats. Benazepril treatment significantly suppressed the accumulation of AGE and expression of RAGE in the kidney of SHR. In addition, benazepril treatment reduced the upregulation of NADPH oxidase p47phox, ROS generation and NF-kappaB p65, p-NF-kappaB p65, VCAM-1 and TGF-beta1 expression in the kidney of SHR compared with both untreated SHR and control WKY rats. 4.

    "480": "The recognition that patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may have systemic manifestations and often suffer from comorbid conditions has important implications for therapy that require further research. The most likely link between COPD and extrapulmonary effects is that inflammation in the lung periphery \"spills over\" into the systemic circulation and effects on other organs that may also be affected by the systemic effects of cigarette smoking. The peripheral lung inflammation of COPD and systemic inflammatory effects could be treated by systemic antiinflammatory treatments, but this may have a high risk of systemic side effects, or by inhaled administration of antiinflammatory treatments that suppress inflammation in the lung and prevent the spillover of inflammatory mediators into the systemic circulation. Current therapies for COPD, including inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting beta(2)-agonists, and theophylline, have the potential to reduce systemic features of COPD and comorbid diseases. Treatments for comorbid diseases, such as statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and peroxisome proliferator-activated agonist agonists, may also have beneficial effects on COPD inflammation. Novel antiinflammatory treatments, such as phosphodiesterase-4, nuclear factor-kappaB, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitors, may provide benefits in both COPD and comorbidities, but have a high risk of adverse effects when given systemically, and may need to be given by inhalation. Increased oxidative stress may be an important mechanism linking COPD inflammation, systemic effects, and comorbid disease, so the development of antioxidants, including nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 activators, is a priority. Accelerated aging may be associates in common to COPD and several comorbidities, prompting the development of antiaging molecules, such as sirtuin 1 agonists, which may also be effective in reducing the risk of lung cancer.",

A recombinant Escherichia coli harboring a coupled reaction pathway comprising of aromatic transaminase, phenylpyruvate decarboxylase, carbonyl reductase, and glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) was constructed. In the coupled reaction pathway, the transaminase reaction was coupled with the Ehrlich pathway of yeast; (1) a phenylpyruvate decarboxylase (YDR380W) as the enzyme to generate the substrate for the carbonyl reductase from phenylpyruvate (i.e., byproduct of the transaminase reaction) and to shift the reaction equilibrium of the transaminase reaction, and (2) a carbonyl reductase (YGL157W) to produce the 2-phenylethanol. Selecting the right carbonyl reductase showing the highest activity on phenylacetaldehyde with narrow substrate specificity was the key to success of the constructing the coupling reaction.

The rats were randomly allotted into one of five experimental groups: A (control), B (diabetic untreated), C (diabetic treated with Q), D (diabetic treated with Irb), and E (diabetic treated with Q&Irb), each group containing 10 animals. Groups B-E received STZ. Diabetes was induced in four groups by a single intraperitoneal (i.p) injection of STZ (50 mg/kg, freshly dissolved in 5 mmol/L citrate buffer, pH 4.5). Two days after STZ treatment, development of diabetes in four experimental groups was confirmed by measuring blood glucose levels in a tail vein blood samples. Rats with blood glucose levels of 250 mg/dL or higher were considered to be diabetic. The rats in Q-, Irb-, and Q&Irb-treated groups were given Q (in a dose of 3 mg/kg body weight), Irb (5 mg/kg body weight), and Q&Irb (in a dose of 1.5 mg/kg + 2.5 mg/kg body weight) once a day orally by using intra-gastric intubation for 12 weeks starting two days after STZ injection. Treatment of Q and especially Irb reduced the glomerular size and thickening of capsular, glomerular, and tubular basement membranes; and increased amounts of mesangial matrix and tubular dilatation and renal function as compared with diabetics untreated. Notably, the better effects were obtained when Q and Irb given together. We conclude that Q, Irb, and especially Q+Irb therapy causes renal morphologic and functional improvement after STZ-induced diabetes in rats. We believe that further preclinical research into the utility of Q and Irb treatment, alone or its combination, may indicate its usefulness as a potential treatment in diabetic nephropathy (DNp).",

Fifty-three non-dialyzed hypertensive CKD patients were included by the study. Serum and urinary 8-hydroxydeoxy guanosine (8-OHdG) levels (as a marker of oxidative DNA damage), serum superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (G-Px) activities (as antioxidant enzymes) were measured. SOD activity was higher and G-Px activity was lower in the patient group as compared to control group. Serum and urinary 8-OHdG levels were found to be higher in the patients with proteinuria greater than 3 g/day than those in the patients with proteinuria less than 3 g/day. It has been determined that G-Px activity and urinary 8-OHdG level were lower in the patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor compared to patients treated with calcium channel blocker. The present data show oxidative DNA damage at a higher level in the patients with proteinuria greater than 3 g/day.

Changes in albuminuria showed a positive correlation with changes in GFR (p = 0.002) and a negative correlation with changes in sCr (p = 0.007), and changes in ACR showed a negative correlation with changes in sCr (p = 0.004) in all patient groups. In our study, we observed that spironolactone, both alone and in combination with ACEi/ARB treatment, was well tolerated, and that it slowed down the progression of diabetic nephropathy with a marked antialbuminuric effect. Our results showed that the antialbuminuric effect developed by the decrease of intraglomerular pressure, particularly in patients with persistent microalbuminuria despite long-term ACEi/ARB treatment; adding aldosterone blockers to treatment was beneficial.",

The present study examined the effects of carvedilol and its combination with captopril on blood pressure, left ventricular hypertrophy, kidney vascular changes and kidney function in spontaneously hypertensive rats with adriamycin nephropathy. Four groups of 20 SHR each were involved: (1) control group: SHR; (2) ADR group: SHR treated with ADR (2mg/kg i.v. twice in 20 days); (3) ADR-C group: SHR treated with ADR and carvedilol (30 mg/kg/day) and (4) ADR-CC group: SHR treated with ADR and carvedilol (30 mg/kg/day) and captopril (60 mg/kg/day). Systolic-, diastolic- and mean-pressures and pulse pressure were determined at weeks 6 and 12 after the second ADR injection; and body weight, creatinine clearance and proteinuria at weeks -3, 6 and 12. The rats were sacrificed at week 6 or 12, the weights of the left and right ventricles and kidneys measured and the kidney vascular index was calculated as described by Bader and Mayer. Both carvedilol alone and combined with captopril significantly reduced systemic blood pressure but the effect of the latter was more pronounced and registered from week 4 till the end of the study. Carvedilol and its combination with captopril significantly decreased SBP, DBP and MAP. They also decreased PP, prevented the development of LVH, and renal vascular changes and slowed the progression of chronic renal failure and these effects were stronger in the ADR-CC group than in the ADR-C group. The antihypertensive drugs failed to prevent proteinuria in ADR SHR. Significant positive correlations were found between PP (but not SBP, DBP and MAP) and both proteinuria and Ccr in all groups of rats. In conclusion, carvedilol alone, but more strongly in combination with captopril, significantly reduced blood pressure, PP, LVH, renal blood vessel changes and chronic renal failure progression.",

Podocyte proliferation is a hallmark of HIV-associated nephropathy, although this classic pathology is observed less frequently in antiretroviral-treated patients. The pathogenesis of HIV-associated nephropathy involves direct HIV infection of renal epithelial cells, and the widespread introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy has had a significant impact on the natural history and epidemiology of this unique disease. These observations have established antiretroviral therapy as the cornerstone of treatment for HIV-associated nephropathy in the absence of prospective clinical trials.

When PSCs are stimulated by oxidative stress, ethanol and its metabolite acetaldehyde, and cytokines, the phenotype of quiescent fat-storing cells converts to myofibroblastlike activated PSCs, which then produce extracellular matrix, adhesion molecules, and various chemokines in response to cytokines and growth factors. Recent data suggest that PSCs have a phagocytic function. Plateletderived growth factor is a potent stimulator of PSC proliferation. Transforming growth factor beta, activin A, and connective tissue growth factor also play a role in PSC-mediated pancreatic fibrogenesis through autocrine and paracrine loops. Following pancreatic damage, pathophysiological processes that occur in the pancreas, including pancreas tissue pressure, hyperglycemia, intracellular reactive oxygen species production, activation of protease-activated receptor 2, induction of cyclooxygenase 2, and bacterial infection play a role in sustaining pancreatic fibrosis through increased PSC proliferation and collagen production by PSCs. Targeting PSCs might be an effective therapeutic approach in chronic pancreatitis. Various substances including vitamin A, vitamin E, polyphenols, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ligands, and inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system show great promise of being useful in the treatment of chronic pancreatitis.",

Treatments with NAC (2 g/kg per day) and ramipril (1 mg/kg per day) were initiated at 16 weeks in the drinking fluid. Systolic blood pressure, plasma levels of insulin and glucose, and insulin resistance were significantly higher in rats treated with glucose for 20 weeks. This was associated with a higher production of superoxide anion and NADPH oxidase activity in aorta and liver and with a marked reduction in protein expression of skeletal muscle insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) in the gastrocnemius muscle. NAC prevented all these alterations. Although ramipril also reversed high blood pressure, it had a lesser effect on insulin resistance (including IRS-1) and blocked superoxide anion production only in aorta. Ramipril, in contrast to NAC, did not reduce NADPH oxidase activity in aorta and liver or plasma levels of 4-hydroxynonenal and malondialdehyde. Results suggest that the inhibition of the oxidative stress in hypertensive and insulin-resistant states contributes to the therapeutic effects of NAC and ramipril. Whereas NAC exerts effective antioxidant activity in multiple tissues, ramipril appears to preferentially target the vasculature.",

Here, we propose that the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), in addition to its central role in arterial hypertension, also regulates blood vessel formation during normal development and cancer. This mechanistic hypothesis is based on reports of biochemical, genetic, clinical, and epidemiologic data reviewed herein. Species differences between the RAS of rodents and humans likely account for why such a fundamental role in angiogenesis went unrecognized for so long. If proven correct, this hypothesis carries many implications for the medical practices of cardiology, oncology, and neonatology.",

We calculated the left ventricular mass index (LVMI) and ejection fraction and the peak velocity of early rapid filling to peak velocity of atrial filling (E/A) ratio. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), systolic dysfunction, and diastolic dysfunction (LVDD) were present in 25.9%, 5.6%, and 59.25% of the patients, respectively. The mean blood pressure (MBP) was higher and the hemoglobin lower among patients with LVH, which was related to the age of the patients. We observed a significant negative association of the E/A ratio-used as an index of LVDD-with HbA1c (r = -.448, P = .002) and age (r = -.57, P = .000) and a positive association with the level of total glutathione (r = .322, P = .029). Multiple regression analysis of the E/A ratio showed significance only for HbA1c but not for MBP or LVMI.

Despite recent progress, there is still no optimal therapy that would stop progression of renal disease. May be pentoxifilline (PTF)--the old medication which is still used to treat peripheral vascular disease and brain ischemia will be the new adjunct to RAAS blockade. In addition, PTF has been shown to decrease the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species. PTF therapy may improve the hemoglobin response in patients with previously rh-EPO resistant anemia in renal failure. This may occur due to inhibition of proinflammatory cytokine production.

This study evaluated the effects of Ginkgo biloba extract (GbE) on the metabolism of the ECM in rat mesangial cells cultured in hyperglycemic conditions. The cultured mesangial cells in high glucose conditions were allotted into six groups: normal control group, high glucose group, low concentration of GbE group, moderate concentration of GbE group, high concentration of GbE group, and captopril group. In the presence of high glucose, the levels of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN) were decreased significantly, and the levels of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) were increased significantly. These changes were reversed by GbE. GbE lowered the levels of transforming growth factor-beta(1) (TGF-beta(1)), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) of the high glucose group. Furthermore, GbE also decreased the expressions of collagen IV and laminin of the high glucose group. In summary, the results suggest that GbE postpones the extracellular matrix accumulation by inhibiting the synthesis of ECM and promoting the degradation of ECM, and therefore, is a potential drug for the prevention and treatment of DN.",

    "540": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a hypervascular tumor, and tumor progression and prognosis is associated with angiogenesis. Extracellular matrix remodeling and inflammation play important roles in hepatocarcinogenesis. Some ingredients of extracellular matrix such as endostatin and sulfated polysaccharide, some immunomodulatory agents and cox-2 inhibitor suppress the angiogenesis of HCC. Because vasculogenic mimicry is associated with high tumor grade, some differentiation agents are used to inhibit antiagiogenesis. Besides suppressing the proliferation directly, somatostatin inhibits angiogenesis to suppress growth indirectly. Copper chelator prevents copper from functioning as a cofactor in angiogenesis. The renin-angiotensin system is frequently activated in patients with chronic liver diseases. Perindopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, inhibits angiogenesis by reducing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production. Kinase inhibitors of VEGF and epidermal growth factor receptors are expected to be of benefit for some patients. Following transarterial embolisation and/or resection, antiangiogenic therapy could prevent the recurring and metastasis. Hypoxia enhances the proliferation, suppresses the differentiation and apoptosis, and induces multidrug resistance of HCC. Because antiangiogenic therapies induce hypoxia, it should be borne in mind the side affects of antiangiogenic therapy. Because long-acting antiangiogenent are needed to control cancer, it needs more clinical studies to confirm the drug resistance of antiangiogenetic therapy.",

However, in 122 patients with IDC, the TNF-alpha genotype was not associated with plasma TNF-alpha concentrations. In 133 patients with IDC, the TNF-alpha genotype failed to predict either the severity of pump dysfunction and cardiac dilatation at baseline, or changes in pump function and cardiac dimensions after six months of medical treatment. We conclude therefore that although the TNF-alpha gene G-308A polymorphism may contribute to the development of IDC, it does not influence pump function or adverse cardiac remodelling in patients with IDC. Genotyping for this variant is therefore unlikely to assist in identifying patients with heart failure who may be particularly susceptible to novel immunomodulatory therapeutic strategies.",

Patients on digoxin therapy had a lower left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF), higher prevalence of previous hospitalizations for HF and atrial fibrillation, and lower prevalence of hypertension. After adjustment for age, LVEF, history of HF hospitalizations, New York Heart Association class, presence of chronic renal insufficiency, presence of atrial fibrillation, and prescriptions for beta blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, HF hospitalizations (hazard ratio 1.08, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.77 to 1.50, p = 0.66), total mortality (hazard ratio 1.03, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.35, p = 0.85), or the combined end point of HF hospitalization and total mortality (hazard ratio 1.11, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.53, p = 0.52) were not different in patients using digoxin compared with those not using digoxin. Clinical outcomes were not different in subgroups of patients with EF < or =25%, New York Heart Association class III or IV, atrial fibrillation, heart rate < or =60 beats/min, or patients on beta-blocker therapy. In conclusion, digoxin use was not associated with a decrease in HF hospitalizations or overall mortality rates in a cohort of hospitalized patients with HF with LV systolic dysfunction on contemporary background HF treatment including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta blockers.", 
    "554": "Aim of the study was comparative assessment of hypotensive, antiischemic efficacy and effect on left ventricular (LV) diastolic function of calcium antagonists, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and blockers of beta-adrenoreceptors.", 
    "555": "The data obtained evidence that at monotherapy most pronounced lowering of arterial pressure is observed during use of verapamil CR or amlodipine. Therapy with all studied drugs led to significant decrease of number of episodes of ST-segment depressions, their duration and amplitude during 24 hours. Greatest decrease of frequency of episodes of ST-segment depression was observed during therapy with heart rate reducing calcium antagonists. Disturbed LV diastolic function improved under action of calcium antagonists and beta-adrenoblockers did not change during therapy with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. Diminishment of severity of disturbance of diastolic function under influence of pulse slowing calcium antagonists was associated in the first place with augmentation of LV filling in the first phase of diastole, but during therapy with amlodipine and beta-adrenoblockers - with decrease of contribution of systole of the left atrium. beta-adrenoblockers and diltiazem improved LV diastolic function in patients with episodes of painless myocardial ischemia.", 
    "556": "Comparative assessment of hypotensive action of preparations from three groups revealed that greatest lowering of arterial pressure occurred during monotherapy with verapamil SR and amlodipine. The stadied drugs differently affected damage of a target organ - the heart - in patients with AH.", 
    "557": "We studied 40 men aged 26 - 59 years (mean age 49.0 +/- 1.9 years) with hypertensive disease (HD) and found that therapy based on the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril in young and middle aged patients with stage I and II HD appeared to be not only one of effective methods of correction of elevated arterial pressure (AP) but also of associated with it cognitive abnormalities. Effect of therapy was determined by achievement of target AP values and was more pronounced in patients older than 44 years. Favorable effects of perindopril in relation to parameters of cognitive functions in patients with HD allows to rate perindopril not only as effective and safe hypotensive preparation but as remedy exerting cerebroprotective effect.", 
    "558": "With the aim to investigate influence of glycemic control on clinical state and course of disease, renal function, and neurohormonal profile of patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) we studied 81 patients with NYHA functional class (FC) II - III CHF, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 45% and type 2 DM. As a result of randomization 2 groups were formed - active with achievement of target levels of glycemia (n=41) and usual treatment (n=40). Retrospective analysis in dependence of efficacy of sugar lowering therapy was also conducted. Group 1 (n=18) comprised patients with achieved 1% lowering of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1 ), group 2 (n=26) - patients with bA1c lowering < 1%, group 3 (n=31) - patients with increase of HbA1 . Total duration of the investigation for the first analysis was 12, for the second - 6 months. Control examination was carried out at baseline, after 6 and 12 months of investigation and included assessment of clinico-functional status, glomerular filtration rate, neurohormonal profile (brain natriuretic peptide, noradrenalin, and angiotensin II). The state of carbohydrate metabolism was assessed with the help of determination of the level of HbA1c and oral glucose tolerance test. Absence of dynamics of glycemia in active and nonactive groups, in the active group improvement of clinico-functional status, quality of life, and parameters of remodeling was noted. Complementary retrospective analysis revealed improvement of functional status, renal function, and lowering of RAAS activity at 1% lowering of HbA1 and achievement of its target values. With this it was shown that betterment of functional possibilities ensued at lowering of HbA1c level not less than by 0.8%. Thus necessity and efficacy of strict glycemic control of DM in patients with CHF was proved.", 
    "559": "The prevalence of type 2 diabetes is rising at an alarming rate worldwide. Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the diabetic population. Future CAD risk should be routinely assessed in patients with diabetes as specific subgroups might benefit from information derived from cardiac stress testing and other diagnostic procedures. Risk factor control is of paramount importance in all cases and it usually requires sustained lifestyle modifications, coupled with pharmacological interventions. Statins and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are the first-line agents for the treatment of dyslipidaemia and hypertension, respectively. Microvascular, but not macrovascular, complications of diabetes are effectively prevented by good glycaemic control. Metformin is considered the first-choice agent in overweight diabetic subjects, while the role of thiazolidinediones is currently the focus of medical research. The diagnosis of acute coronary events in patients with diabetes is often challenging because of the high prevalence of silent ischaemia in these subjects. All acute cardiac events need to be promptly treated and myocardial reperfusion attempted without delay. Maintaining glucose levels as close to normal as possible, during and shortly after an acute event, improves prognosis in patients with diabetes. Risk factor control remains the cornerstone of secondary prevention; beta-blockers, ACE-inhibitors and antiplatelet agents confer additional symptomatic and survival benefit. Similar therapeutic principles also apply to patients with type 1 diabetes. This article addresses the complex problem of managing patients with diabetes and coronary artery disease.", 
    "560": "The symptoms and signs of heart failure can occur in the setting of an increased cardiac output and has been termed 'high output heart failure'. An elevated cardiac output with clinical heart failure is associated with several diseases including chronic anaemia, systemic arterio-venous fistulae, sepsis, hypercapnia and hyperthyroidism. The underlying primary physiological problem is of reduced systemic vascular resistance either due to arterio-venous shunting or peripheral vasodilatation. Both scenarios can lead to a fall in systemic arterial blood pressure and neurohormonal activation leading to overt clinical heart failure. In contrast to low output heart failure, clinical trial data in this area are lacking. The use of conventional therapies for heart failure, such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers and certain beta-blockers with vasodilatory properties, is likely to further reduce systemic vascular resistance resulting in deterioration. The condition, although uncommon, is often associated with a potentially correctable aetiology. In the absence of a remediable cause, therapeutic options are very limited but include dietary restriction of salt and water combined with judicious use of diuretics. Vasodilators and beta-adrenoceptor positive inotropes are not recommended.",

Patients were required to be continuously benefit-eligible six months pre- and one year post-index date, and to have no prescription claims for any antihypertensive therapy six months prior to the index date. Patients were followed for one year to assess persistence, medication possession ratio (MPR), adherence (MPR >80%), and proportion of days covered (PDC) with initial antihypertensive therapy. Logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios for persistence, adherence and PDC, adjusted for age, gender, business segment, RxRisk disease categories, average co-pay and concurrent cardiovascular-related medication utilization.",

Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed and Embase were searched for relevant studies. A meta-analysis of all randomized controlled trials fulfilling the predefined criteria was performed. A random-effect model was used to account for heterogeneity among trials. Twenty-eight randomized controlled trials involving 5157 patients were ultimately identified out of 721 studies.

This study assessed the effects of the angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor ramipril and the angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) telmisartan, separately and in combination, in patients aged at least 55 years who had established vascular disease or diabetes with organ damage. Mann et al. demonstrated that, in contrast to monotherapy with either drug, the combination of an ACE inhibitor and an ARB worsens all major renal outcomes with the exception of proteinuria. This commentary recommends that combination therapy with an ACE inhibitor and an ARB to retard progression of renal disease should be avoided in patients with proteinuria lower than 1 g per day.

Captopril and Valsartan, an automatic biochemical analyzer, and radioimmunoassay technology were used to an experimental rat model of diabetic cardiomyopathy to dynamically measure the levels of creatine kinase-MB, lactate dehydrogenase-1 in the serum, and angiotensin I and II in the plasma, and to observe changes in the myocardial ultrastructure. The content of angiotensin I and II was increased and the renin-angiotensin system was in a hyperfunctional state in experimental rats with myocardial damage. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor 1 antagonists improved the myocardial structure and cardiac function. It is concluded that hyperfunction of the renin-angiotensin system is involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy, with an increase in angiotensin being a key factor. Preventing the increase in angiotensin II or the action of angiotensin II on its receptor can prevent the occurrence and development of diabetic cardiomyopathy.",

Because these effects might reflect progressive effects of essential hypertension on the brain, we asked whether structural and functional brain indices would predict the success of pharmacological treatment of hypertension among 45 previously unmedicated individuals. After initial structural MRI and functional positron emission tomography imaging, subjects were randomly assigned in a double-blind fashion for treatment for 1 year with either lisinopril or atenolol. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreases after treatment stabilization were correlated to a pretreatment index of brain aging (combined ratings of ventricle and sulcal size and white matter hyperintensities) and the pretreatment change in regional cerebral blood flow during working memory in the thalamus and posterior parietal regions of interest. In multiple regression analyses, the structural brain index and the blood flow response in the thalamus predicted 20% of the variance in the systolic blood pressure response to treatment controlling for pretreatment blood pressure, age, gender, and type and dose of medication. Alcohol use influenced the thalamic response measure, but covariates did not alter the relation between greater indices of brain aging and less successful blood pressure response to treatment.

Whether antihypertensive treatment can lead to reverse remodelling of the coronary microvasculature remains to be determined. The preliminary results of a recent study in patients with arterial hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy show that 6 months' treatment with a combination of perindopril and indapamide is accompanied by a significant decrease in blood pressure and left ventricular mass and an increase in resting and hyperaemic myocardial blood flow measured non-invasively with positron emission tomography. This suggests that coronary microvascular dysfunction can be reversed by treatment with these drugs and might contribute to the prevention of ischaemic heart disease in these patients.",

The mainstay of antihypertensive therapy is now inhibition of the renin-angiotensisn system involving the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers. The appropriate blood pressure level for the commencement of these drugs and what should be the achieved blood pressure in individuals with diabetes remain controversial. Promising new therapies are currently under preclinical investigation or in early stage clinical trials, and hopefully these newer agents, probably used as adjunct therapies, will further improve the prognosis of individuals with diabetes with early or overt renal disease.",

Filtration fraction (FF) was calculated. We determined haemoglobin levels, endothelial function, inflammatory status, plasma renin activity (PRA) and N-terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). Urinary albumin excretion (UAE) was measured in 24 h urine. Mean GFR was 74+/-28 ml/min/1.73 m(2). GFR was strongly related to RBF (r=0.915, P<0.001), FF (r=0.546, P<0.001), but only weakly to endothelial function and PRA. In multivariate analysis, RBF (r=0.938, P < 0.001), FF (r=0.786, P < 0.001) and haemoglobin levels (r= -0.520, P<0.001) were independently associated with GFR. UAE was mainly dependent on RBF (r= -0.401, P < 0.001) and increased exponentially with decreasing RBF. RBF was mainly associated with NT-proBNP (r= -0.561, P<0.001) and PRA (r= -0.422, P<0.001).",

    "599": "It has been well documented in the literature that ibuprofen interacts with different groups of antihypertensive drugs (beta-adrenergic blockers, alpha-adrenergic blockers, diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors), reducing their antihypertensive activity. The mechanism of action of ibuprofen involves inhibition of the enzyme cyclooxygenase, thereby inhibiting the synthesis of inflammatory prostaglandins and vasodilatory prostaglandins that increase renal blood flow and thus favor the excretion of water and sodium. More than five days of treatment with both drugs are normally required for the interaction to manifest. Although the changes in blood pressure resulting from this interaction are typically small, some patients can experience substantial elevations in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. It has been estimated that the avoidance of minor changes in systolic pressure in patients with osteoarthritis subjected to treatment with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs would avoid over 30,000 deaths due to myocardial infarction, and over 2000 deaths due to coronary disease, in the United States alone.",

    "604": "In rat diabetic animal models, ANG(1-7) treatment prevents the development of cardiovascular complications. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)2 is a major ANG(1-7)-generating enzyme in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), and its expression is decreased by a prolonged exposure to high glucose (HG), which is reflected by lower ANG(1-7) levels. However, the underlying mechanism of its downregulation is unknown and was the subject of this study. Rat aortic VSMCs were maintained in normal glucose (NG) or HG ( approximately 4.1 and approximately 23.1 mmol/l, respectively) for up to 72 h. Several PKC and NADPH oxidase inhibitors and short interfering (si)RNAs were used to determine the mechanism of HG-induced ACE2 downregulation. Cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis, real-time quantitative PCR, and ANG(1-7) radioimmunodetection. At 72 h of HG exposure, ACE2 mRNA, protein, and ANG(1-7) levels were decreased (0.17 +/- 0.01-, 0.47 +/- 0.03-, and 0.16 +/- 0.01-fold, respectively), and the expression of NADPH oxidase subunit Nox1 was increased (1.70 +/- 0.2-fold). The HG-induced ACE2 decrease was reversed by antioxidants and Nox1 siRNA as well as by inhibitors of glycotoxin formation. ACE2 expression was PKC-betaII dependent, and PKC-betaII protein levels were reduced in the presence of HG (0.32 +/- 0.03-fold); however, the PKC-betaII inhibitor CG-53353 prevented the HG-induced ACE2 loss and Nox1 induction, suggesting a nonspecific effect of the inhibitor. Our data suggest that glycotoxin-induced Nox1 expression is regulated by conventional PKCs. ACE2 expression is PKC-betaII dependent. Nox1-derived superoxides reduce PKC-betaII expression, which lowers ACE2 mRNA and protein levels and consequently decreases ANG(1-7) formation.", 
    "605": "Amid the rapidly rising number of people with diabetes worldwide, the prevalence of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is expected to increase considerably despite available treatments. Consequently, novel therapeutic agents are urgently needed. Ruboxistaurin mesylate is a bisindolylmaleimide that specifically inhibits the beta isoform of protein kinase C (PKC). In experimental models of DKD, ruboxistaurin normalized glomerular hyperfiltration, decreased urinary albumin excretion, preserved kidney function, and reduced mesangial expansion, glomerulosclerosis, and tubulointerstitial fibrosis. These beneficial effects of ruboxistaurin, both alone and combined with renin-angiotensin system inhibition, have been observed in a variety of experimental models of DKD. A phase 2 study of PKC-beta inhibition in persons with type 2 diabetes and DKD already treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition and/or angiotensin receptor blockade has been conducted. Addition of ruboxistaurin for 1 year reduced urinary albumin, prevented an increase in urinary transforming growth factor-beta, and stabilized estimated glomerular filtration rate. Based on secondary analyses of clinical trials in patients with diabetic retinopathy or neuropathy, ruboxistaurin appears safe and may also prevent onset of DKD. PKC-beta inhibition holds promise as a new strategy to improve kidney disease outcomes in diabetes. Large-scale clinical trials will be required to confirm safety and to validate prospective benefits of ruboxistaurin on relevant clinical endpoints in DKD.",

Eligible patients in this prospective, observational, longitudinal, multicentre registry included all normotensives--including treated hypertensives--with BP <140/90 mm Hg, a history of coronary aritery disease and a history of cerebrovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease or diabetes (with micro-albuminuria) or dyslipidaemia, in whom ramipril was indicated for CV risk reduction and had been prescribed by the treating physician. The primary outcome was the effect on BP at 8 weeks, and the secondary outcome was the incidence of cough at 8 weeks. Ramipril was initiated at 2.5 mg once daily (OD) for a week, followed by 5 mg OD for 3 weeks and was then increased to 10 mg OD. Data was analysed using ANOVA and Chi-square test. A total of 1,048 patients participated in this registry; 868 (82.82%) continued with the treatment till the end of the registry (ie, 8 weeks). At baseline, systolic BP was 130.10 +/- 5.38 mm Hg, while diastolic BP was 81.07 +/- 4.36 mm Hg. At 8 weeks, these values changed non-significantly to 123.41 +/- 6.33 mm Hg and 79.03 +/- 4.84 mm Hg, respectively. At week 1, 41 patients had cough, which increased non-significantly to 58 by week 8. Only 6 patients complained of severe cough at week 8, which did not lead to treatment discontinuation. Tolerability of the treatment was assessed to be 'excellent' or 'good' by 63.3% patients and 67% physicians. Treatment with ramipril 10 mg daily in patients with high risk of CV events and normal/ controlled BP produced neither a significant fall in BP nor significant adverse events in real-world clinical practice and was well tolerated.",

Native arteriovenous fistulas, the best type of dialysis vascular access, have a 1-year primary patency rate that is extremely variable, ranging 40-80%. Neointimal hyperplasia is the most important cause of arteriovenous fistula late primary dysfunction. In recent years the arteriovenous fistula late primary patency rate has not improved because of the increase of old uremic patients with a high number of comorbidities and the lack of new therapeutic interventions. Therefore, we performed a long-term case-control study to analyze which factors or drugs may affect native arteriovenous fistula late primary patency rate in 60 incident hemodialysis patients. The arteriovenous fistula late primary patency rate was 75.1% after 12 months, 58.5% after 24 months, and 50% after 987 days. Homocysteine levels during follow-up had a significant direct association with vascular access failure (event vs. event-free 28.5+/-1.9 vs. 22.3+/-1.2 micromol/L, p<0.01). Folate values had a trend toward an inverse relationship with arteriovenous fistula failure (event vs. event-free 11.5+/-1.2 vs. 14.6 vs. 1.1 ng/mL, p=0.06). Patients treated with folic acid and/or statin had an arteriovenous fistula late primary patency rate significantly higher than patients without folic acid and statin therapy, respectively, 81.7% vs. 66% after 1 year and 71.5% vs. 39.1% after 2 years (p=0.02). Many other factors were not associated with vascular access failure. Statin and homocysteine-lowering folic acid therapy is associated with prolonged arteriovenous fistula survival.

    "623": "The identification of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) has led to a significant paradigm in the field of vascular biology and opened a door to the development of new therapeutic approaches. Based on the current evidence, it appears that EPCs may make both direct contribution to neovascularization and indirectly promote the angiogenic function of local endothelial cells via secretion of angiogenic factors. This concept of arterial wall repair mediated by bone marrow (BM)-derived EPCs provided an alternative to the local \"response to injury hypothesis\" for development of atherosclerotic inflammation. Increased oxidant stress has been proposed as a molecular mechanism for endothelial dysfunction, in part by reducing nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability. EPCs function may also be highly dependent on a well-controlled oxidant stress because EPCs NO bioavailability (which is highly sensitive to oxidant stress) is critical for their in vivo function. The critical question is whether oxidant damage directly leads to an impairment in EPCs function. It was revealed that activation of angiotensin II (Ang II) type 1 receptor stimulates nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase in the vascular endothelium and leads to production of reactive oxygen species. We observed that Ang II accelerates both BM- and peripheral blood (PB)-derived EPCs senescence by a gp91phox-mediated increase of oxidative stress, resulting in EPCs dysfunction. Consistently, both Ang II receptor 1 blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been reported to increase the number of EPCs in patients with cardiovascular disease. In this review, we describe current understanding of the contributions of oxidative stress in cardiovascular disease, focusing on the potential mechanisms of EPCs senescence.",

Hypertension and oral beta-blocking, ACE inhibitor, and hypolipidemic agents protected against CS. In UA, these variables were age, previous angina or AMI, right ventricular heart failure, arrhythmia. Beta-blocking agents were associated with a reduction in CS. Deaths from CS and AMI, respectively, were 62.8% and 38.7% in persons with UA. Doing PCIs has increased significantly; it is more prevalent in ex-smokers and those with right ventricular heart failure and mechanical ventilation; lower performance is associated with need for cardiopulmonary resuscitation; patients who die are older or have a history of AMI.",

In the present study, we evaluated the effect of treatment with the calcium channel blocker amlodipine or the angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril on vascular endothelial function and arteriosclerosis in patients with essential hypertension who had already been receiving angiotensin receptor blocker monotherapy. Thirty-two patients with essential hypertension treated with angiotensin receptor blocker monotherapy were randomized to receive 5 mg of amlodipine (n=16) or 4 mg of perindopril (n=16) once daily in the morning for 24 weeks. The patients were evaluated before and after therapy to assess changes in blood pressure, flow-mediated vasodilation (a parameter of vascular endothelial function), and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (a parameter of arteriosclerosis). Before treatment, there were no significant differences in the above parameters between groups. After treatment, there was a similar significant decrease in blood pressure in both groups. Flow-mediated vasodilation increased significantly in the perindopril group compared with the amlodipine group; however, the decrease in brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity was not significantly different between groups. In conclusion, these results suggest that the angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril is superior to the calcium channel blocker amlodipine for reducing vascular endothelial dysfunction when co-administered with angiotensin receptor blockers in patients with essential hypertension.",

Future studies should focus on the clinical importance of radiofrequency ablation for atrial fibrillation, versus that of traditional approaches to treatment.", 
    "641": "Pepsin-digested soy protein hydrolysate (SPH) has been reported to be responsible for many of the physiological benefits associated with soy protein consumption. In the present study, we investigated the effects of SPH with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory potential on blood pressure and renal injuries in rats with N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (L-NAME)-induced hypertension. Rats were fed a diet containing L-NAME (50 mg/kg body weight) with or without SPH (at 1%, 3%, or 5%) for 6 weeks. We found that ingestion of SPH ameliorated the development of hypertension during the 6-week experimental period. SPH was also found to ameliorate renal function by decreasing urinary protein excretion and elevating the creatinine clearance rate. The levels of kidney ACE activity, malonaldehyde, tumor necrosis factor-a and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and the expression of CYP4A decreased in the 5% SPH group. Consumption of 5% SPH also ameliorated renal damage according to the histopathological analysis. These findings suggest that SPH might ameliorate the elevation of blood pressure and show renoprotective effects in nitric oxide (NO)-deficient rats, and one possible mechanism might be mediation via its ACE inhibitory activity.", 
    "642": "The purposes of this study were to examine the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) on myocardial flow reserve in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in the subacute phase using oxygen-15 positron emission tomography (PET) and to elucidate the relationship between the myocardial flow reserve and remodeling in the chronic phase. Sixty patients who had been treated with coronary angioplasty within 12 h after the onset of AMI were enrolled. Patients were divided into an enalapril (ACEI) group and a candesartan (ARB) group. The myocardial flow reserve was measured by oxygen-15 water PET in the subacute phase from the 20th to the 30th day after the onset of AMI. Left ventriculography was performed to measure the left ventricular ejection fraction in the chronic phase about 6 months after the onset. Ten patients (33%) in the enalapril group and 4 patients (13%) in the candesartan group stopped taking their respective medications within a few days of starting, because of side effects such as cough or hypotension. Thus, the prevalence of medication intolerance was higher in the enalapril group. The myocardial flow reserve in the subacute phase and the left ventricular ejection fraction in the chronic phase were lower in the enalapril group (2.08 +/- 0.30 and 42 +/- 6%) than in the candesartan group (2.25 +/- 0.20 and 49 +/- 5%) (p < 0.05). The myocardial flow reserve significantly correlated with the left ventricular ejection fraction in all patients (r = 0.45, p < 0.01). The myocardial flow reserve assessed by PET in the subacute phase after AMI was found to be related to left ventricular remodeling in the chronic phase.",

The rate of preserved EF was 53.5% and those with preserved EF were older, more likely to be female, and had a lower serum hemoglobin concentration than those in the reduced EF group. In the multivariate analysis, only older age was independently related to CHF with preserved EF. CHF patients with preserved EF who were successfully discharged from hospital and then followed at the outpatient clinic were reviewed and re-hospitalization for CHF was examined by Cox hazard univariate analysis, which showed that prior CHF hospitalization, absence of hypertension, and non-use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and/or angiotensin-receptor blocker (ARB) were predictors. In the multivariate analysis, non-use of ACEI/ARB was the sole predictor for CHF re-hospitalization.",

Effects of a seven-day enalapril pre-treatment (EPT, 0.16 mg/kg body weight subcutaneously every 24 h) on ionic currents underlying tachycardia-induced early electrical remodelling after 24 h rapid atrial pacing (RAP, 600 beats/min) in rabbit atrium were studied.", 
    "651": "Animals were divided into four groups (n=4 each): control; paced only; enalapril only; and enalapril and paced, respectively. Using patch-clamp technique in whole-cell mode, current densities were measured in isolated atrial myocytes.",

Also after EPT, RAP led to a significant downregulation of ICa,L by 39% (-7.5+/-1.3 pA/pF [paced and enalapril]). RAP decreased transient outward potassium current (Ito, -45%, 51.5+/-3.9 pA/pF [control] vs. 28.5+/-4.5 pA/pF [paced only]). EPT did not alter Ito (44.2+/-8.1 pA/pF [enalapril only]). However, RAP did not affect Ito in enalapril-treated animals and averaged 50.4+/-9.8 pA/pF (paced and enalapril).", 
    "653": "In summary, EPT has several effects on ion channels in rabbit atrium: 1) EPT increases ICa,L current density, but cannot prevent its downregulation due to RAP; 2) EPT has no influence on Ito current density, but can prevent its downregulation due to RAP. Although changes of single ion channels must be interpreted in context of the complex atrial electrophysiology as a whole, our results provide a possible explanation of the in vivo observation that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition is mainly beneficial on the early electrical remodelling due to the atrial fibrillation-equivalent RAP.", 
    "654": "The proton-coupled di- and tripeptide transporter PepT1 (SLC15a1) is the major route by which dietary nitrogen is taken up from the small intestine, as well as being the route of entry for important therapeutic (pro)drugs such as the beta-lactam antibiotics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and antiviral and anti-cancer agents. PepT1 is a member of the major facilitator superfamily of 12 transmembrane domain transporter proteins. Expression studies in Xenopus laevis on rabbit PepT1 that had undergone site-directed mutagenesis of a conserved arginine residue (arginine282 in transmembrane domain 7) to a glutamate revealed that this residue played a role in the coupling of proton and peptide transport and prevented the movement of non-coupled ions during the transporter cycle. Mutations of arginine282 to other non-positive residues did not uncouple proton-peptide cotransport, but did allow additional ion movements when substrate was added. By contrast, mutations to positive residues appeared to function the same as wild-type. These findings are discussed in relation to the functional role that arginine282 may play in the way PepT1 operates, together with structural information from the homology model of PepT1 based on the Escherichia coli lactose permease crystal structure.", 
    "655": "Residual renal function (RRF) contributes to the quality of life of patients on dialysis through the better solutes clearances, fluid removal, less degree of anemia, better calcium-phosphorus control, better nutrition and removal of other uremic toxins. The preservation of RRF is associated with higher patient survival in peritoneal dialysis (PD), and is now accepted that RRF and peritoneal clearance are not of equal value in patient survival. This review studies the factors that contribute to the reduction or loss of RRF in PD patients and the medical measures to avoid it. The decline of RRF has been associated with age, inflammation/nutrition status, peritonitis rate, renal function and transport type at PD initiation, ESRD aetiology, and associated comorbidity. Cardiovascular disease before and during PD has been related with loss of RRF. Volume overload and high blood pressure on one side, and dehydration and some drugs on the other side, can facilitate the decline of RRF. Use of antihypertensive agents as angiotensin- converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers could preserve RRF. Still is on debate the influence of PD modality (manual or automated), with some more arguments for better preservation with continuous ambulatory PD. The employ of more biocompatible solutions seems to have a positive effect on RRF, but more evidence is still needed. Avoiding the mentioned factors and applying preventive measures we can preserve RRF and increase the well-being of PD patients.",

Raynaud phenomenon and scleroderma (hardening of the skin) are hallmarks of the disease. The typical patient is a young or middle-age woman with a history of Raynaud phenomenon who presents with skin induration and internal organ dysfunction. Clinical evaluation and laboratory testing, along with pulmonary function testing, Doppler echocardiography, and high-resolution computed tomography of the chest, establish the diagnosis and detect visceral involvement. Patients with systemic sclerosis can be classified into two distinct clinical subsets with different patterns of skin and internal organ involvement, autoantibody production, and survival. Prognosis is determined by the degree of internal organ involvement. Although no disease-modifying therapy has been proven effective, complications of systemic sclerosis are treatable, and interventions for organ-specific manifestations have improved substantially. Medications (e.g., calcium channel blockers and angiotensin-II receptor blockers for Raynaud phenomenon, appropriate treatments for gastroesophageal reflux disease) and lifestyle modifications can help prevent complications, such as digital ulcers and Barrett esophagus. Endothelin-1 receptor blockers and phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors improve pulmonary arterial hypertension. The risk of renal damage from scleroderma renal crisis can be lessened by early detection, prompt initiation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy, and avoidance of high-dose corticosteroids.

    "691": "Hypertensive disorders are the most common medical disorders of pregnancy and are associated with adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. When considering pregnancy, women with pre-existing chronic hypertension should be screened for target organ damage, especially renal dysfunction. Since blood pressure usually decreases until midpregnancy and returns to, or exceeds, prepregnancy values in the third trimester, antihypertensive treatment can sometimes be withdrawn in low-risk women, and reintroduced if needed. Recommended antihypertensive drugs are labetalol, methyldopa and nifedipine. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists and atenolol must be avoided. The occurrence of superimposed preeclampsia should be detected by appropriate clinical and laboratory evaluation. Preeclampsia is a multisystem maternal and fetal syndrome. The risk of preeclampsia is slightly reduced by low-dose aspirin and by calcium supplementation in women with low dietary calcium intake. For early-onset preeclampsia, expectant management improves perinatal outcomes, but requires close maternal and fetal surveillance. For acute management of severe hypertension, intravenous labetalol and oral nifedipine are recommended. Delivery is indicated in the presence of signs of maternal or fetal distress.

This study reports the effects of ACE inhibitors on larval growth in the cotton leafworm Spodoptera littoralis. Feeding ACE inhibitors ad lib decreased the growth rate, inhibited ACE activity in the larval hemolymph, and down-regulated trypsin activity in the larval gut. These results indicate that S. littoralis ACE may influence trypsin biosynthesis in the larval gut by interacting with a trypsin-modulating oostatic factor (TMOF). Injecting third instar larvae with a combination of Aea-TMOF and the ACE inhibitor captopril, down-regulated trypsin biosynthesis in the larval gut indicating that an Aea-TMOF gut receptor analogue could be present.

TUNEL method for apoptosis and immunohistochemical staining for TGF-beta1, alpha-SMA, clusterin-beta and clusterin-alpha/beta antibodies were performed. Apoptotic cells especially increased in the kidney tubuli of untreated diabetic group and on the contrary, a significant decrease was observed in the group that received a combined drug treatment. While sCLU was increased in the glomeruli and tubuli of the untreated diabetic group, it was decreased in all the treated groups. An increase in the nCLU immunoreactivity was observed in the podocytes, mesangial cells, and the injured tubule cells of the untreated diabetic group. nCLU immunopositive cells were decreased in all treated diabetic groups. In addition to this, the distribution of nCLU was similar to the distribution of apoptotic cells in the diabetic groups. Our results indicate that sCLU expression in diabetic nephropathy was induced due to renal tissue damage, and the nCLU expression increase in renal tubuli was related to apoptosis.

After controlling for pre-existing hypertension and renal disease and the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, a significant association was found between ingestion of prescription cough syrup and illness onset (adjusted odds ratio: 31.0, 95% confidence interval: 6.93-138). Laboratory analyses confirmed the presence of diethylene glycol (DEG) in biological samples from case patients, 8% DEG contamination in cough syrup samples and 22% contamination in the glycerin used to prepare the cough syrup.",

In the experimental study, daily consumption of ethanol (10% v/v), water and solid food was assessed in 12 male Wistar rats before and after the intraperitoneal administration of captopril 50 mg/kg/day.", 
    "705": "In alcoholics, mean weekly standard alcoholic drink consumption was not different during captopril treatment or placebo. However, both groups had a significantly lower intake than during baseline. Days of abstinence increased and days of drunkeness decreased in the group receiving captopril, when compared with baseline but not with placebo. Craving was significantly reduced by captopril when compared with placebo. In rats, captopril reduced not only alcohol consumption but also water and food intake.",

PRA was directly correlated with plasma aldosterone, fibrinogen, d-dimer, and PAI-1. The relationship of PRA with fibrinogen and PAI-1 remained significant after correction for age, gender, duration of hypertension, and smoking status. Plasma aldosterone levels were directly correlated with fibrinogen, D-dimer, and PAI-1, whereas plasma angiotensin-converting enzyme was not related with any of the coagulation parameters. Elevated PRA, aldosterone, fibrinogen, D-dimer, prothrombin fragment 1+2, and PAI-1 levels were associated with clinical and/or instrumental evidence of hypertension-related cardiac and renal damage.

Bardet-Biedl syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder, which includes renal dystrophy, dystrophic extremities (often polydactyly), obesity, hypogenitalism, renal disease, and mental retardation. It was first described by John Z. Laurence and Robert Moon. The basic components of the syndrome were established by George Bardet in 1920 and Arthur Biedl in 1922.

Both 2-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography were performed at baseline, 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months after these procedures. LA dimensions, mitral inflow velocity, and tissue Doppler imaging of the mitral annulus were examined. LA dimensions decreased in both groups. The mean late mitral annulus velocity increased from 1 week to 3 months in both groups, but the mean late transmitral peak velocity increased only in the ECV group (42.1+/-14.4 cm/s to 56.7+/-14.8 cm/s, p<0.001 vs 38.7+/-12.5 cm/s to 44.8+/-16.7 cm/s, p=NS).",

However, because LA function was lower in the ABL group than in the ECV group and did not recover to the baseline levels until 3 months after ABL, a meticulous anticoagulation program should be considered.", 
    "715": "In the last 30 years we have seen considerable progress in the management of patients with diabetes, in particular with diabetic renal disease. A number of paradigms have been broken down, namely the following, as a consequence, clinical care has improved dramatically. . Significant renal involvement and albuminuria is rare in patients with essential hypertension. 2. High GFR is good for prognosis. 3. Only proteinuric diabetic patients have a poor prognosis. 4. Microalbuminuria only predicts renal disease. 5. Reducing blood pressure may cause low perfusion in the kidney and other organs with long-term negative effect, especially on the glomerular filtration rate. 6. Only in the presence of high blood pressure, should microalbuminuric patients receive anti-hypertensive treatment, including blockade of the RAS. 7. Only reducing blood pressure by blocking RAS in diabetes is relevant and justified. 8. Normoalbuminuria as indicated in the present definition is 'normal'. 9. ACE-I or ARB can only be used separately. 10. Diastolic blood pressure and later systolic pulse pressure are the best parameters for blood pressure recording. 11. Microalbuminuria is the strongest risk marker in patients with type 1 diabetes. 12. Screening for microalbuminuria is relevant, but follow-up was not proposed (also regarding microalbuminuria). In the present situation, it is well-known that patients with essential hypertension may sometimes have microalbuminuria, and it is known that it predicts a poor prognosis. Interestingly, in type 1 diabetes, hyperfiltration is a marker for poor prognosis related to metabolic control. Thus hyperfiltration is a marker for bad development, but microalbuminuria (below the proteinuric level) is also associated with a poor prognosis. It was originally believed that microalbuminuria only predicts renal disease. However, surprisingly it predicts as well cardiovascular disease and early mortality. The story about blood pressure and progression of renal disease is interesting, because it was earlier believed that a certain high blood pressure was mandatory for preservation of the renal function. This appeared to be a completely wrong concept. The data regarding microalbuminuria suggest that patients with microalbuminuria should receive anti-hypertensive treatment, even patients with so-called normal blood pressure. This was confirmed in several trials and also included in the guidelines. Reducing blood pressure is important, but it appeared to be especially beneficial to block the renin-angiontensin system, and it is clear that albuminuria is a continuous variable and is also a risk factor. Earlier it was suggested to use ACE-inhibitors or ARBs. Now it is clear that it is possible to use a combination, with good theoretical background. In the history of hypertension, it was earlier believed that diastolic blood pressure was most important, but later on it was generally accepted that systolic is a better predictor and the goal for treatment and pulse pressure may be even better. Not only is microalbuminuria an important risk marker, but it is as well clear that regression of microalbuminuria is a good marker for a better prognosis in patients. Microalbuminuria is believed to be the strongest risk factor, but new studies actually suggest that a simple parameter such as self-rated health is crucial along with other factors. Regarding new developments, it is clear that new studies have led to several advancements in management in patients, for instance the Steno II study shows positive effect on mortality by multifactorial intervention. Similarly, the ADVANCE study also showed positive effect on mortality by more intensified anti-hypertensive treatment with an ACE-inhibitor. We are eagerly awaiting the results from glucose arm in the ADVANCE study, especially in the light of the ACCORD study showing increased mortality with too strict glycemic control with a goal of 6% in HbA1c.", 
    "716": "This report describes the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in an adult male captive chimpanzee. Although cardiovascular disease in general is common in human and great apes, diagnosis and treatment of PAH in nonhuman primates are uncommon. In the case we present, the adult chimpanzee was diagnosed with an arrhythmia during an annual physical examination and later with PAH during a scheduled cardiovascular evaluation. PAH can either be primary or secondary and can lead to right ventricular overload and heart failure. This description is the first case study of pulmonary arterial hypertension in a great ape species.",

    "718": "The Get With the Guidelines - HF registry and performance improvement program prospectively collects data on patients hospitalized with HF. Performance measures to improve treatment of patients with HF and inhospital mortality were examined by kidney function based on glomerular filtration rate (GFR) categorized as normal (GFR > or = 90), mild (60 < or = GFR < 90), moderate (30 < or = GFR < 60), severe (15 < or = GFR < 30), and kidney failure (GFR < 15 or dialysis).", 
    "719": "Nearly two thirds of hospitalized patients with HF (15,560 patients from 137 hospitals) also had CKD: moderate CKD (43.9%), severe CKD (14.2%), and kidney failure (6.6%). Inpatient mortality was higher for patients with more severe renal dysfunction. Those with kidney failure were significantly less likely to receive nearly all guidelines-based therapies. In contrast, those with moderate or severe CKD often received similar care when compared with those with normal kidney function, except for lower use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or receptor blockers (odds ratio 0.19 [0.13-0.28] and 0.47 [0.36-0.62], respectively) and lower proportions with blood pressure control (odds ratio 0.70 [0.58-0.85] and 0.52 [0.42-0.63], respectively).", 
    "720": "In a large contemporary cohort of patients hospitalized with HF, we found that renal dysfunction was a highly prevalent comorbidity. Despite higher mortality rates, patients with increased severity of renal dysfunction were less likely to receive important guideline-recommended therapies. Further efforts are needed to improve the care of patients with HF and CKD.", 
    "721": "Patients with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) have increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Lifestyle modification and medication can prevent or delay progression to diabetes (PD), but whether such interventions also reduce the risk of CVD has not been rigorously tested. The Nateglinide And Valsartan in Impaired Glucose Tolerance Outcomes Research (NAVIGATOR) trial is a multinational, randomized, double-blind, 2 x 2 factorial trial in subjects with IGT (on a screening oral glucose tolerance test [OGTT]) aged > or = 50 years with known CVD or aged > or = 55 years with > or = 1 CVD risk factor. Enrollment began in January 2002 and was completed January 2004, with 9,518 patients randomized to receive 1 of 4 possible treatment combinations as follows: nateglinide with valsartan, nateglinide with valsartan-placebo, nateglinide-placebo with valsartan, or nateglinide-placebo with valsartan-placebo. All subjects are participating in a clinic-based and telephone-based lifestyle intervention aimed at reducing weight and dietary fat and increasing physical activity. The 3 coprimary end points are new onset of T2DM, a \"core\" composite of major cardiovascular events (death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure), and an \"extended\" composite including the components of the core composite plus coronary revascularization and hospitalization for unstable angina. The study was designed to evaluate whether reducing postprandial hyperglycemia, blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, or both interventions reduce the risk of T2DM or cardiovascular events in patients with IGT.", 
    "722": "High levels of activity of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and sympathetic nervous system (SNS) are related to left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). A percentage of subjects with hyperactivity to treadmill stress test show LVH to echocardiogram. This paper aims at evaluating neurohumoral influence over these subjects by comparing drugs that block both the RAS and the SNS. In a 1-year open protocol, 195 normotensive subjects, with hyperactivity to treadmill stress test and LVH, were randomly assigned to supervised physical exercise, rilmenidine 1 mg day(-1), atenolol 50 mg day(-1), enalapril 10 mg day(-1) or losartan 50 mg day(-1). Changes in left ventricular mass index (LVMI), measured by means of echocardiogram, were the primary end point. Changes in systolic blood pressure (SBP) at rest and peak effort were also evaluated. Enalapril significantly brought LVMI down in relation to the basal value (28.2%; n=36) similarly to losartan (26.9%; n=42); P>0.05. However, both were more efficient than physical exercise (2.9%; n=39), rilmenidine (5.1%; n=38) and atenolol (7.2%; n=40); P<0.001. There was no significant difference in SBP reduction at rest and peak effort in groups assigned to atenolol, enalapril and losartan; P>0.05. In such groups, reduction was greater than in groups assigned to physical exercise and rimenidine; P<0.001. In conclusion, drugs that block RAS were more efficient in reducing LVH than physical exercise and drugs that block SNS, and such reduction took place regardless of SBP level reduction at rest and peak effort.",

Use of corticosteroids is associated with scleroderma renal crisis. Over half of cases of scleroderma renal crisis require dialysis; just under half of these will be able to discontinue dialysis over the following 2 years. Despite clear improvement in 12-month survival, which is a testament to the efficacy of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in renal crisis, long-term mortality remains significant, especially with ongoing dialysis.",

Defined by an unintentional weight loss exceeding 7.5% of body mass during more than 6 months, it is presented by the association of nutritional deficiencies, digestive and/or urinary losses as well as metabolic abnormalities causing fat and lean mass loss and is associated to a poor prognosis. The pathophysiology of cachexia and heart failure presented some similarities associating especially neuro-hormonal activation, a cortisol/DHEA ratio imbalance, as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines activation. Currently the treatment of cachexia is mainly preventive, based on ACE-inhibitors and beta-blockers therapy and physical reconditioning. The benefits of hormonal and nutritional substitutes remains to be evidenced.",

Calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, sartans, phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors and serotonin re-uptake blockers are used for Raynaud's phenomenon. Intravenous prostanoids (alprostadil, iloprost, epoprostenol, treprostinil) and endothelin receptor antagonists (bosentan, sitaxsentan, ambrisentan) show efficacy in treatment of pulmonary hypertension and distal ischemia. Successful treatment of digital ulcers secondary to systemic sclerosis was possible with sildenafil and bosentan. A platelet gel is currently in clinical trials for scleroderma-related digital ulcers. Several drugs, which directly reduce excessive production of collagens and other connective tissue proteins have been applied in systemic sclerosis. These include interferon gamma, d-penicillamine, kolchichicine, calcitriol, and imanitib. However, so far, strategies to control fibrosis by directly reducing excessive connective tissue production have been disappointing in controlled studies.",

The most frequent reason physicians cited for nonprescription of statins (33%) was that patients were not high risk enough and/or current guidelines did not support statin use. In conclusion, outpatients at high cardiovascular risk continue to be undertreated as a result of a combination of physician underestimation of cardiovascular risk (knowledge gap) and barriers to implementation of evidence-based therapy (practice gap).",

    "746": "Discovery of prorenin/renin, or (pro)renin, receptor uncovered a novel function of (pro)renin as receptor ligand in addition to enzyme and its precursor; the same receptor was shown to promote reversible activation of prorenin and enhance the enzyme activity of mature renin. Stimulating the receptor activates mitogen-activated protein kinase and hypertrophic, hyperplastic, profibrotic, and cyclooxygenase-2-activating signals. These receptor signals were transmitted independently of angiotensin (Ang) II receptor. A specific blocker of the receptor was discovered-a peptide segment in prorenin that binds to the receptor and blocks ligand binding. Its infusion in animal models of hypertension and diabetes not only prevented nephropathy and cardiac hypertrophy, but also caused regression of nephropathy, whereas Ang II receptor gene deletion and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition merely delayed the onset or ameliorated pathologic phenotypes. These results suggest that (pro)renin receptor is responsible for end-organ damage.",

The use of a layered double hydroxide (LDH) to release active drugs is limited by the low pH of the stomach (pH approximately 1.2), in whose condition it is readily dissolved. To overcome this limitation, xyloglucan (XG) extracted from Hymenaea courbaril (jatob\u00e1) seeds, Brazilian species, was used to protect the LDH and allow the drug to pass through the gastrointestinal tract. All the materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, elemental analyses, transmission electronic microscopy, thermal analyses, and a kinetic study of the in vitro release was monitored by ultraviolet spectroscopy. The resulting hybrid system containing HDL-Enal-XG(3) slowly released the Enal. In an 8-h of test, the system protected 40% (w/v) of the drug. The kinetic profile showed that the drug release was a co-effect behavior, involving dissolution of inorganic material and ion exchange between the intercalated anions in the lamella and those of phosphate in the buffer solution. The nanocomposite coated protection with XG was therefore efficient in obtaining a slow release of Enal.", 
    "748": "Metabolic syndrome (MS), which is composed of such factors as hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, abdominal obesity, arterial hypertension, and dyslipidemia, contributes to accelerated development of atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, and type 2 diabetes. It has thus become one of the major public-health challenges worldwide. The primary goal of its clinical management is to reduce the risk for cardiovascular diseases related to atherosclerosis, especially myocardial infarction, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease, and to lower the risk for type 2 diabetes. The fi rst stage in its successful preventive management is identification of the population at high risk of developing metabolic syndrome. The therapeutic approach to metabolic syndrome consists fi rst of all of lifestyle modification, i.e. the introduction of a low calorie diet, weight reduction, and regular physical activity. For people at high risk for cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes as well as those with coronary artery disease and/or type 2 diabetes, pharmacological therapy should be considered. Pharmacological management must address the multipathological process of metabolic syndrome, with each component identified and properly treated. Current therapies for metabolic syndrome treat fi rst of all obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. The pharmacological agents most often suggested are those which increase insulin resistance (metformin and thiazolidinediones). Among the medications used in metabolic syndrome therapy are also fibrates and statins for atherogenic dyslipidemia and those lowering blood pressure, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers.

Group A, 11 HSN and 7 IgAN, 88% with an International Study of Kidney Disease in Children (ISKDC) biopsy grade > or = III and severe clinical features, were treated with corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide (CYC-P) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker (ACEi/ARB). Group B, 12 HSN and 13 IgAN, 72% with biopsy findings as above and 52% with severe clinical features, were treated with ACEi/ARB +/- corticosteroids. The outcome classification was: (a) healthy; (b) mild proteinuria, normal glomerular filtration rate (GFR); (c) active renal disease; (d) chronic renal failure. Twenty-six patients had a good outcome (a + b). The 17 children with poor outcome (c + d) had lower GFR at onset and at follow-up, higher albumin excretion at follow-up, and higher percentage of segmental glomerulosclerosis in the renal biopsy, than those with good outcome. Treatment with corticosteroids, CYC-P and ACEi/ARB was effective in increasing GFR, reducing proteinuria and decreasing the disease activity index. The proteinuria had decreased at follow-up in both groups. In group A, GFR increased and histopathological activity index declined after treatment. The outcome did not differ between groups A and B. The effects of treatment did not differ between HSN and IgAN.", 
    "761": "The Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) is important for the regulation of cardiovascular physiology, where it controls blood pressure, and salt- and water homeostasis. Dysregulation of RAS can lead to severe diseases including hypertension, diabetic nephropathy, and cardiac arrhythmia, and -failure. The importance of the RAS is clearly emphasised by the widespread use of drugs targeting this system in clinical practice. These include, renin inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor type I blockers, and inhibitors of the angiotensin converting enzyme. Some of the important effectors within the system are 7 transmembrane (7TM) receptors (or G-protein-coupled receptors) such as the angiotensin II Receptors type I and II (AT1R and AT2R) and the MAS-oncogene receptor. Several findings indicate that the 7TM receptors can form both homo- and heterodimers, or higher orders of oligomers. Furthermore, dimerization may be important for receptor function, and in the development of cardiovascular diseases. This is very significant, since \"dimers\" may provide pharmacologists with novel targets for improved drug therapy. However, we know that 7TM receptors can mediate signals as monomeric units, and so far it has been very difficult to establish if our observations reflect actual well-defined dimerization or merely reflect close proximity between the receptors and/or various types of functional interaction. In this review, we will present and critically discuss the current data on 7TM receptor dimerization with a clear focus on the RAS, and delineate future challenges within the field.",

The goal of the current study was to determine the role of endogenous cardiac myocyte Gq signaling and its role in cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction during high blood pressure (BP). We induced renal artery stenosis for 8 weeks in control mice and mice expressing a peptide inhibitor of Gq signaling (GqI) using a 2 kidney, 1 clip renal artery stenosis model. 8 weeks following chronic high BP, control mice had cardiac hypertrophy and depressed function. Inhibition of cardiomyocyte Gq signaling did not reverse cardiac hypertrophy but attenuated increases in a profile of cardiac profibrotic genes and genes associated with remodeling. Inhibition of Gq signaling also attenuated the loss of cardiac function. We determined that Gq signaling downstream of angiotensin II receptor stimulation negatively impacted beta-adrenergic receptor (AR) responses and inhibition of Gq signaling was sufficient to restore betaAR-mediated responses. Therefore, in this study we found that Gq signaling negatively impacts cardiac function during high BP. Specifically, we found that inhibition of AT1-Gq signaling augmented betaAR mediated effects in a renal artery stenosis model of hypertension. These observations may underlie additional, beneficial effects of angiotensinogen converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists observed during times of hemodynamic stress.",

    "772": "Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) remains a life-threatening complication after heart transplantation (HT). Recipients with severe intimal thickening are 10-fold more likely to suffer cardiac events than those without severe hyperplasia. From July 1987 to July 2007, we performed 323 HTs with 5-year actuarial freedom from CAV of 69%, similar to the data reported by the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation, namely, 68% at 5 years. Therefore, CAV is not uncommon in Asia. The pathogenesis of CAV is initial endothelial injury followed by intimal hyperplasia and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells. It may be caused by both immunological events (involving T or B cells in response to donor major histocompatibility antigens, or natural killer [NK] cell-triggered recruitment of T cells not responsive to donor alloantigen) and nonimmunologic factors, such as older age, ischemia-reperfusion injury, viral infection (particularly cytomegalovirus [CMV] infection), immunosuppressive drugs, and classic risk factors, such as hyperlipidemia, insulin resistance, and hypertension. The therapy for CAV has been disappointing, despite prescriptions of statin lipid-lowering agents, calcium-channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and antiproliferative drugs. Patients with CAV are often not amenable to successful revascularization (medical or surgical) because of the diffuse obliterative process. Prophylaxis of CAV starts with modification of risk factors: hypertension, hyperlipemia, hyperglycemia, obesity, and smoking, as well as promotion of exercise programs. The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and antiproliferative drugs may slow the progression of CAV by various immunologic and nonimmunologic effects. Prevention of CMV infection reduces CAV. Mycophenolate mofetil and signal transduction inhibitors, such as everolimus, reduce intimal thickening and CAV.",

The development of antiarrhythmic agents with the potential for fewer adverse ventricular effects and less extracardiac toxicity is a primary aim of current investigations. At present, pharmacologic research is actively focused on developing antiarrhythmic agents with multiple or novel ion channel effects. There are 4 agents that act by simultaneously blocking multiple ion channels that are currently under regulatory review: azimilide dihydrochloride, tedisamil, dronedarone, and vernakalant (RSD-1235). In addition, agents with mechanisms of action that differ from those of existing agents (eg, gap junction modulators) are under review, as is the use of nonantiarrhythmic agents (eg, renin-angiotensin system antagonists, statins, n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids) to alter the cardiac substrate and suppress AF in some patient subtypes.", 
    "776": "In recent years, a handful of research investigations have shown that some antihypertensive drugs, i.e., angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), and calcium channel blocker (CCB), can inhibit myocardial expression and/or activity of calcineurin. Calcineurin is a Ca(2+)-calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase and is a target for some immunosuppressive drugs. It is well known that traditional immunosuppressants, such as cyclosporine A (CsA) and tacrolimus (FK506), are anticalcineurin, and their prohypertensive effects are such that antihypertensive therapy is often required in organ transplant recipients who receive these drugs. Therefore, the idea that ACEI, ARB, and CCBs are both antihypertensive and anticalcineurin seems paradoxical. This invited review tries to summarize these new findings and analyze the scientific and clinical significance of these claims. The review also emphasizes some of the shortcomings in these studies and some questions that need to be addressed in future investigations.",

    "781": "In heart failure (HF), development of pressure or volume overload of the lung microcirculation elicits a series of structural adaptations, whose functional correlate is an increased resistance to gas transfer across the alveolar-capillary membrane. Acutely, hydrostatic mechanical injury causes endothelial and alveolar cell breaks, impairment of the cellular pathways involved in fluid filtration and reabsorption, and resistance to gas transfer. This process, which is reminiscent of the so-called alveolar-capillary stress failure, is generally reversible. When the alveolar membrane is chronically challenged, tissue alterations are sustained and a typical remodeling process may take place that is characterized by fixed extracellular matrix collagen proliferation and reexpression of fetal genes. Remodeling leads to a persistent reduction in alveolar-capillary membrane conductance and lung diffusion capacity. Changes in gas transfer not only reflect the underlying lung tissue damage but also bring independent prognostic information and may play a role in the pathogenesis of exercise limitation and ventilatory abnormalities. They are not responsive to fluid withdrawal by ultrafiltration and tend to be refractory even to heart transplantation. Some drugs can be effective that modulate lung remodeling (eg, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, whose impact on the natural course of cardiac remodeling is well known) or that increase nitric oxide availability and nitric oxide-mediated pulmonary vasodilation (eg, type 5 phosphodiesterase inhibitors). This review focuses on the current knowledge of these topics.",

    "798": "Diabetes mellitus and arterial hypertension are two common diseases that often coexist. Patients with diabetes have much higher rate of hypertension than that in general population. The co-existence of these disorders appears to accelerate microvascular and macrovascular complications and greatly increases the cardiovascular risk, risk of stroke and end stage renal disease. Arterial hypertension is clearly related to nephropathy in subjects with type 1 diabetes. In patients with type 2 diabetes insulin resistance seems to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of hypertension. Several well designed randomized controlled trials have provided evidence that patients with diabetes will benefit from a more aggressive treatment of hypertension. This benefit is seen at blood pressure level<130/80 mmHg. Moreover, most diabetic patients with hypertension require combination therapy to achieve optimal blood pressure goals. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, diuretics, beta-adrenoreceptor blockers and calcium- channel blockers are all effective antihypertensive agents in type 2 diabetes mellitus and no comparative trial showed the superiority of any particular class in either lowering blood pressure or reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. On the basis of experimental arguments and clinical observations that have shown their apparent superiority in slowing diabetic nephropathy, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers are preferred as the first choice alone or in combination with diuretics. Second choice should be long-acting calcium-channel blockers or cardioselective beta blockers. Clinicians should be aware of the need for aggressive treatment of hypertension and spend more time in order to provide maximal benefit to the treatment of diabetes mellitus and hypertension.", 
    "799": "This review describes the therapeutic approach of endocrine arterial hypertension in clinical practice. In mineralocorticoid-related hypertension, adrenalectomy is the treatment of choice for aldosterone-producing adenomas and monolateral primary aldosteronism, whereas pharmacologic blood pressure (BP) control is indicated for the other forms of primary aldosteronism such as bilateral adrenal hyperplasia. Spironolactone is the drug of choice, but intolerable side effects limit its use; amiloride or eplerenone are a valid alternative. If BP remains uncontrolled, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I), angiotensin II receptor antagonists (AII-RA) and calcium channel blockers (CCB) may be added. Hypertension accompanying Cushing's syndrome can be approached with surgery, but antihypertensive treatment both pre- and postoperative is required as well. Eplerenone, AII-RA and ACE-I are indicated, while peroxisome proliferator activated receptor upsilon agonists may help for the insulin resistance syndrome. Drugs that suppress steroidogenesis should be used with care because of their serious side effects. Subjects with catecholamine-dependent hypertension due to a neuroendocrine neoplasm need to undergo preoperative alpha-adrenergic blockade with phenoxybenzamine or doxazozine. When adequate alpha-adrenergic blockade is achieved, beta-adrenergic blockade with low dose propranolol may be added. If target BP is not achieved, CCB and/or metyrosine are indicated. Laparoscopic adrenalectomy is the procedure of choice for solitary intra-adrenal neoplasms <8 cm. Acute hypertensive crises that may occur before or during surgery should be treated intravenously with sodium nitroprusside, phentolamine, nicardipine or labetalol. For malignant neoplasms, chemo- and radiopharmaceutical therapy may be considered.", 
    "800": "High plasma prorenin levels in diabetic patients predict microvascular complications, but the mechanism of the connection between these factors has remained unclear. (Pro)renin receptors were recently found in the human kidney, and their distribution in the kidneys include the mesangium and podocytes. The binding of prorenin to the (pro)renin receptor triggers two major pathways: the angiotensin II-dependent pathway as a result of the conversion of prorenin to the active form of prorenin through a conformational change, and the angiotensin II-independent, (pro)renin-receptor-dependent intracellular mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. To investigate whether the (pro)renin-receptor-dependent pathways contribute to the pathophysiology of the end-organ damage that occurs in diabetes, the handle region peptide, which binds to the receptor and competitively inhibits prorenin from binding to the receptor, was administered to rats with streptozotocin-induced type I diabetes and to a model of type II diabetes, db/db mice. The handle region peptide significantly inhibited the development of end-organ damage in these diabetic animals, and had a greater benefit than angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in diabetic angiotensin II-type 1a-receptor-deficient mice. In addition, the infusion of the handle region peptide in animals with streptozotocin-induced type I diabetes significantly regressed the nephropathy that had already occurred. These results suggest that prorenin and the (pro)renin receptor play a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of diabetic nephropathy. Receptor-bound prorenin may prove useful as an important therapeutic target for the prevention and regression of end-organ damage in patients with diabetes.",

Essential fatty acids (EFAs) and their long-chain metabolites: gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), dihomo-GLA (DGLA), arachidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and other products such as prostaglandins E1 (PGE1), prostacyclin (PGI2), PGI3, lipoxins (LXs), resolvins, protectins including neuroprotectin D1 (NPD1) prevent platelet aggregation, lower blood pressure, have anti-arrhythmic action, reduce LDL-C, ameliorate the adverse actions of homocysteine, show anti-inflammatory actions, activate telomerase, and have cytoprotective properties. Thus, EFAs and their metabolites show all the classic actions expected of the \"polypill\". Unlike the proposed \"polypill\", EFAs are endogenous molecules present in almost all tissues, have no significant or few side effects, can be taken orally for long periods of time even by pregnant women, lactating mothers, and infants, children, and adults; and have been known to reduce the incidence cardiovascular diseases including stroke. In addition, various EFAs and their long-chain metabolites not only enhance nitric oxide generation but also react with nitric oxide to yield their respective nitroalkene derivatives that produce vascular relaxation, inhibit neutrophil degranulation and superoxide formation, inhibit platelet activation, and possess PPAR-gamma ligand activity and release NO, thus prevent platelet aggregation, thrombus formation, atherosclerosis, and cardiovascular diseases. Based on these evidences, I propose that a rational combination of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids and the co-factors that are necessary for their appropriate action/metabolism is as beneficial as that of the combined use of a statin, thiazide, a beta blocker, and an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, folic acid, and aspirin. Furthermore, appropriate combination of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids may even show additional benefits in the form of protection from depression, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, and enhances cognitive function; and serve as endogenous anti-inflammatory molecules; and could be administered from childhood for life long.", 
    "806": "A soybean angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptide fraction was reported to have antihypertensive activity in a rat study. The purpose of the present study was to examine if the presence of isoflavones in the soybean ACE inhibitory peptide fraction may contribute to the blood-pressure-lowering property. The isoflavone concentration in soybean samples was analyzed on a C 18 reverse-phase column using a two-step gradient solvent system. Producing soybean hydrolysate led to a nearly 40% loss of isoflavones compared with the original soybean flour, but the isoflavone composition did not change and the dominant isoflavone chemicals remained as 6''-O-malonylgenistin and 6''-O-malonyldaidzin. Ion exchange chromatography affected significantly both the content and the composition of the isoflavones. The dominant isoflavones in the ion-exchanged fraction were aglycones and nonacylated isoflavones, accounting for 95.8% of the total amount of 987.7 microg/g. It was calculated that the isoflavone content in the soybean ACE inhibitory peptide fraction was 25 times less than the minimal effective isoflavone dose reported. In vitro study also showed that adding isoflavones into both soybean flour hydrolysate and soybean ACE inhibitory peptide samples to a concentration of as high as 31.5% (w/w) did not affect ACE inhibitory activity (IC 50 values). The findings along with previously published results indicated that the contribution of isoflavones in soybean ACE inhibitory peptide fraction to the blood-pressure-lowering property in a short-term feeding study might be negligible.",

Early insulin signaling steps are impaired in essential hypertension and a large body of data suggests that there is a crosstalk at multiple levels between the signal transduction pathways that mediate insulin and angiotensin II actions.

At early intracellular level angiotensin II acts on JAK-2/IRS1-IRS2/PI3-kinase, JNK and ERK to phosphorylate serine residues of key elements of insulin signaling pathway therefore inhibiting signaling by the insulin receptor. On another level angiotensin II inhibits the insulin signaling inducing the regulatory protein SOCS 3. Angiotensin II acting through the AT1 receptor can inhibit insulin-induced nitric oxide (NO) production by activating ERK 1/2 and JNK and enhances the activity of NADPH oxidase that leads to an increased reactive oxygen species generation. From the clinical standpoint, the inhibition of the renin angiotensin system improves insulin sensitivity and decreases the incidence of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). This might represent an alternative approach to prevent type 2 diabetes in patients with hypertension and metabolic syndrome, (i.e. insulin resistant patients). This review will discuss: a) the molecular mechanisms of the crosstalk between the insulin and angiotensin II signaling systems b) the results of clinical studies employing drugs targeting the renin-angiotensin II-aldosterone systems and their role in glucose metabolism and diabetes prevention.",

In a double-blind randomized clinical trial, 82 patients with uncontrolled BP, receiving hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily, were selected to receive amiloride 2.5-5 mg/day (n = 39) or enalapril 10-20 mg/day (n = 43). Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) was done before and after 12-weeks of treatment. Office BP was measured in the 4(th), 8(th), and 12(th) weeks. The doses of amiloride and enalapril were doubled in the fourth week, and propranolol was added in the 8th week if office BP was above 140/90 mm Hg. There was a greater BP reduction in patients treated with enalapril. The ABPM delta values between the groups were 3.6 +/- 2.2, 3.9 +/- 2.2, and 1.1 +/- 2.7 mmHg for 24-h, daily, and nightly systolic blood pressure, respectively, favoring enalapril. For diastolic blood pressure (DBP), the deltas were 1.7 +/- 2.0, 3.2 +/- 1.5, and 1.2 +/- 1.9 mmHg, respectively (p = 0.039 for daily DBP). Office SBP decreased more and sooner in patients allocated to enalapril (p = 0.003). More patients taking amiloride required propranolol to control BP (p = 0.035). Potassium increased 0.3 mEq/L on the average in both groups. Cough, albeit predominantly mild, was reported more frequently by participants treated with enalapril.

Available data indicate that essential hypertension is a risk factor for sexual dysfunction, as male and female sexual dysfunction is more prevalent in hypertensive patients than normotensive individuals. Several mechanisms have been implicated in the pathogenesis of sexual dysfunction in hypertensive patients, and major determinants include severity and duration of hypertension, age, and antihypertensive therapy. Female sexual dysfunction, although more frequent than its male counterpart, remains largely under-recognized. Older antihypertensive drugs (diuretics, beta-blockers, centrally acting) exert negative results, whereas newer drugs have either neutral (calcium antagonists, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) or beneficial effects (angiotensin receptor blockers). Erectile dysfunction is related to ischemic heart disease and might be an 'early therapeutic window' of asymptomatic coronary artery disease.

Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) as well as angiotensin II subtype 1 receptor antagonists (ARA) have been shown to decrease proteinuria, reduce the local renal inflammatory processes and slow the progression of renal insufficiency. Despite recent progress, there is still no optimal therapy which inhibits progression of renal disease. It is possible that pentoxifilline (PTX) an old medication which is still used to treat peripheral vascular disease will be the new adjunct to RAAS blockade. In addition, PTX has been shown to decrease the production of pro inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species. 61-Year-old man with nephrotic proteinuria, diabetes type 2, hypertension, chronic viral hepatitis type C and slightly impaired renal function was desribed. Proteinuria as daily urine protein excretion (DPE), serum creatinine and eGFR (MDRD mode) were measured. Proteinuria was diagnosed in 2003 (DPE 3.5 g), creatinine 1.3-1.5 mg/dl. The patient had been examined in Department of Nephrology but exact reason of nephrotic syndrome was not recognized because he refused kidney biopsy. Therapy was started with ACEI and temporary effect as decrease of DPE to 0.2 g, eGFR was about 60 ml/min. and serum creatinine in normal range. In 2004 DPE increased to 8.98-9.42 g, serum creatinine 1.1-1.3 mg/dl. The dose of ACEI was increased and after then ARA was added. After one month of combined therapy DPE fell to 7.7 g, next the doses of both drugs were increased to maximum (losartan 100 mg and lisinopril 40 mg) and DPE fell to 6.8 g, serum creatinine was 1.4 mg/dl and potassium 5.4 mmol/l.

The correct diagnosis was rapidly made using a low-dose delayed-enhanced cardiac multidetector computed tomography scan performed immediately after a normal coronary angiogram, demonstrating typical myocardial late hyperenhancement and good correlation with delayed enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. This case suggests that myocarditis can be accurately diagnosed by delayed-enhanced cardiac multidetector computed tomography in an emergency setting. The other lesson from this case is that patients presenting with severe clinical symptoms, important ECG signs and high myocardial enzyme levels should be closely monitored for at least 72 hours, even when myocardial infarction has been excluded.",

Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) comprises up to 20% of biopsy-proven glomerular disease in children and adults. We report on a 9-month-old infant who presented with nephrotic syndrome, hypertension and progressive deterioration of renal function due to FSGS. As immunosuppressive agents are often unsuccessful in treating this condition, we adopted renoprotection as the mainstay treatment for this patient, through rigorous control of blood pressure and proteinuria with a multi-drug regimen including renin-angiotensin axis blockade. Initially, there was partial improvement, with a gradual decline in proteinuria and a concomitant rise in the glomerular filtration rate, before the disease eventually passed into complete clinical and laboratory remission. We speculate that infants with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome due to FSGS may benefit from tight control of hypertension, mainly though early blockade of the renin-angiotensin axis. We believe that its renoprotecive mechanism counteracts the deleterious effects of both hypertension and proteinuria, thereby not only preventing progressive renal disease, but even paving the way for a remission, as in our patient. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of an infant with nephrotic syndrome (NS) due to FSGS that passed into complete remission while the patient was on renoprotective measures including the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis).",

In addition, hyperuricemia were significantly associated with abnormal albuminuria in the patients without diuretics, uricosuric agents or alcohol usage. Both serum CRP levels and hyperuricemia were significantly related to the presence of albuminuria in patients with diabetes.

Cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts were isolated from neonatal rats to determine the molecular mechanisms for the ACE2 upregulation by ARB treatment. ANG II significantly reduced ACE2 activity and downregulated ACE2 mRNA in cardiac myocytes, effects blocked by the ARB losartan, indicating that ANG II regulates ACE2. ANG II also reduced ACE2 mRNA in cardiac fibroblasts; however, no enzyme activity was detected, reflecting the limited expression of ACE2 in these cells. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) also significantly reduced myocyte ACE2 mRNA. The reduction in ACE2 mRNA by ANG II or ET-1 was blocked by inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1, suggesting that ANG II or ET-1 activates extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/ERK2 to reduce ACE2. Although ACE2 mRNA was not affected by ANG-(1-7), both the ANG II- and ET-1-mediated reductions in ACE2 mRNA were blocked by the heptapeptide. The ANG-(1-7) modulatory effect was prevented by the ANG-(1-7) receptor antagonist [D-Ala7]-ANG-(1-7), indicating that the ANG-(1-7) response was mediated by a specific AT(1-7) receptor. Myocyte treatment with atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) also reversed the ACE2 mRNA downregulation by ANG II or ET-1, whereas treatment with ANP alone was ineffective.

    "863": "Hypertension and osteoporosis are two major age-related disorders; however, the underlying molecular mechanism for this comorbidity is not known. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a central role in the control of blood pressure and has been an important target of antihypertensive drugs. Using a chimeric RAS model of transgenic THM (Tsukuba hypertensive mouse) expressing both the human renin and human angiotensinogen genes, we showed in this study that activation of RAS induces high turnover osteoporosis with accelerated bone resorption. Transgenic mice that express only the human renin gene were normotensive and yet exhibited a low bone mass, suggesting that osteoporosis occurs independently of the development of hypertension per se. Ex vivo cultures showed that angiotensin II (AngII) acted on osteoblasts and not directly on osteoclast precursor cells and increased osteoclastogenesis-supporting cytokines, RANKL and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), thereby stimulating the formation of osteoclasts. Knockdown of AT2 receptor inhibited the AngII activity, whereas silencing of the AT1 receptor paradoxically enhanced it, suggesting a functional interaction between the two AngII receptors on the osteoblastic cell surface. Finally, treatment of THM mice with an ACE inhibitor, enalapril, improved osteoporosis and hypertension, whereas treatment with losartan, an angiotensin receptor blockers specific for AT1, resulted in exacerbation of the low bone mass phenotype. Thus, blocking the synthesis of AngII may be an effective treatment of osteoporosis and hypertension, especially for those afflicted with both conditions.", 
    "864": "Guidelines for the management of hypertension almost invariably include sections where the evidence for or against treatment or for certain types of treatment in certain types of patients is inconclusive. This is especially the case of older patients with hypertension. As a consequence, although a large number of randomized trials including hypertensive patients aged > or = 60 years showed that antihypertensive drugs reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, health care professionals who take care of older adults have been often reluctant to provide adequate antihypertensive therapy. In a recent meta-analysis, the Blood Pressure Lowering Treatment Trialists' Collaboration (BPLTTC) compared the effects of different drugs for reducing blood pressure (BP) in older and younger adults; the reduction in BP levels and the relative risk reduction of a cardiovascular event with various antihypertensive drugs occurred independently of the patients' ages, and the benefits of antihypertensive regimens based on different drug classes were widely comparable across age groups. The BPLTTC analysis strongly suggests an early and aggressive management of hypertension irrespectively of age; more myocardial infarctions, strokes, heart failures and deaths will be prevented by treating hypertensive patients aged > or = 65 years than by treating patients < or = 50 years with the same BP levels. Antihypertensive treatment should be embedded within the management of global cardiovascular risk, with the use of charts for stratifying risk based on additional risk factors, target organ damage or additional clinical conditions.", 
    "865": "Whether older and younger persons derive similar benefit from antihypertensive treatment and whether treatment choices should be tailored to the age of the patient are unresolved issues about which there is a paucity of evidence. The Blood Pressure Lowering Treatment Trialists' Collaboration has attempted to address this deficiency in a meta-analysis that included 31 trials with 190,606 participants. They compared the proportionate risk reductions achieved with different classes of antihypertensive drugs in younger (< 65 years) and older (> 65 years) adults. They reported that there was no clear evidence to support recommendations for particular antihypertensive drug classes in older or younger adults. In this paper we discussed the Trialists' paper and its limitations and strenghts, current guidelines recommendations, and the major conclusions that are important for clinicians.", 
    "866": "The development of diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms is becoming more and more popular in medicine. Their advantage is simplicity which enables wide use in everyday medical practice. The algorithms may have limitations mainly due to simplifications, which not always appear to be helpful in solving complex clinical problems of an individual patient. To serve as a \"signpost\" in clinical practice, the algorithm should be worked out strictly according to the appropriately interpreted data obtained from reliable, current and published medical evidence. This aim is achieved by clinical practice guidelines, being developed by scientific societies. The present paper deals with diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms in chronic heart failure based on the current clinical practice guidelines. The current guidelines by the European Society of Cardiology have been compared with similar documents issued by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association, the Heart Failure Society of America and the Canadian Cardiovascular Society. Similarities and divergences between the guidelines of different societies in respect of treatment for chronic heart failure have been discussed. The detailed description of their role in the treatment has been provided for: non-pharmacological measures (guidelines for lifestyle), drug therapy (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-adrenolytics, aldosterone receptor antagonists, angiotensin receptor blockers, cardiac glycosides and diuretics), implantation of cardioverter-defibrillators and (or) resynchronization device, mechanical support and surgical treatment. The paper also focuses on diagnostic problems and treatment modalities for heart failure with a preserved systolic function of the left ventricle.", 
    "867": "Heart failure (HF), affecting an increasing number of patients, is associated with several diagnostic, therapeutic, socioeconomic problems. Despite considerable advances, prognosis in HF--both in systolic failure and in that with preserved systolic function--is poor, which in part results from not the fully understood pathophysiology of this disease, and therapeutic approaches used at present. Until recently, efforts of researchers focused on the development of effective therapeutic methods in more advanced stages of the disease, but their results were disappointing. Currently, more emphasis is placed on broadly understood methods of HF prevention. When starting HF treatment upon objective confirmation of the diagnosis, there are some primordial goals to be remembered, that if achieved, may translate into postponing the prospect of death and improving the patient's quality of life. Therapy of HF employs pharmaceuthical agents that reduce mortality (beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, aldosterone antagonists) and attenuate symptoms (diuretics, digoxin, inotropes). Intensification of therapy depends on the functional NYHA class. In recent years, fate of patients with advanced HF has improved through the use of electrotherapy (cardioverters-defibrillators and [or] resynchronization devices). The key issue is to develop a uniform model of healthcare for HF patients, focused on an outpatient clinic system rather than a hospital.", 
    "868": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) converts the vasopressor angiotensin II (Ang II) into angiotensin (1-7) [Ang(1-7)], a peptide reported to have vasodilatory and cardioprotective properties. Inactivation of the ACE2 gene in mice has been reported by one group to result in an accumulation of Ang II in the heart and an age-related defect in cardiac contractility. A second study confirmed the role of ACE2 as an Ang II clearance enzyme but failed to reproduce the contractility defects previously reported in ACE2-deficient mice. The reasons for these differences are unclear but could include differences in the accumulation of Ang II or the deficiencies in Ang(1-7) in the mouse models used. As a result, the roles of ACE2, Ang II, and Ang(1-7) in the heart remain controversial. Using a novel strategy, we targeted the chronic overproduction of either Ang II or Ang(1-7) in the heart of transgenic mice and tested their effect on age-related contractility and on cardiac remodeling in response to a hypertensive challenge. We demonstrate that a chronic accumulation of Ang II in the heart does not result in cardiac contractility defects, even in older (8-month-old) mice. Likewise, transgenic animals with an 8-fold increase in Ang(1-7) peptide in the heart exhibited no differences in resting blood pressure or cardiac contractility as compared to age-matched controls, but they had significantly less ventricular hypertrophy and fibrosis than their nontransgenic littermates in response to a hypertensive challenge. Analysis of downstream signaling cascades demonstrates that cardiac Ang(1-7) selectively modulates some of the downstream signaling effectors of cardiac remodeling. These results suggest that Ang(1-7) can reduce hypertension-induced cardiac remodeling through a direct effect on the heart and raise the possibility that pathologies associated with ACE2 inactivation are mediated in part by a decrease in production of Ang(1-7).", 
    "869": "Endothelial dysfunction often precedes Type 2 diabetes-associated cardiovascular complications. One important cause of endothelial dysfunction is oxidative stress, which can lead to reduced nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability. In this study, we examined the effects of ramipril (an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, ACEI) on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and endothelium-dependent vasodilation using a Type 2 diabetic (db/db) murine model. Plasma concentration of 8-isoprostane ([8-isoP]) was measured and used as an indication of the amount of ROS production. Six weeks of ramipril (10 mg/kg/day) treatment significantly reduced [8-isoP] and improved acetylcholine(ACh)-induced vasodilation in db/db mice without altering responses in wild-type (WT) mice. Responsiveness of smooth muscle cells to NO, assessed by sodium nitroprusside-induced vasodilation, was not different between db/db and WT mice regardless of ramipril or vehicle treatment. Our results suggest that ramipril specifically improved endothelium-dependent vasodilation in Type 2 diabetic mice, possibly by reducing ROS levels.",

They were first assigned to a 30-minute rest period, then a follow-up blood pressure measurement was carried out. Patients who did not respond to rest were randomly assigned to receive an oral dose of an antihypertensive drug with different mechanisms of action and pharmacodynamic properties (perindopril, amlodipine, or labetalol), and blood pressure was reassessed at 60- and 120-minute intervals. A satisfactory blood pressure response to rest (defined as postintervention systolic blood pressure < 180 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure < 110 mm Hg, with at least a 20 mm Hg reduction in basal systolic blood pressure and/or a 10-mm Hg reduction in basal diastolic blood pressure) was observed in 31.9% of population. Among nonresponders, 79.1% had a satisfactory blood pressure response to the antihypertensive drug treatment in a 2-hour average follow-up period. No major adverse events were observed.

    "915": "Hypertension affects an estimated 88 million Americans and is controlled to the recommended blood pressure (BP) goal of <140/90 mmHg in only 37% of individuals with hypertension. The benefits of achieving these goals, including significant reductions in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, are well documented. Thus, a concerted effort to improve BP goal attainment is required. The majority of patients will require two or more antihypertensives to achieve BP goal. It has been shown that administering two drugs in a single-dose formulation substantially improves patient compliance compared with separate agent administration. Fixed-dose combination therapy can offer potential advantages over individual agents, including increased efficacy, reduced incidence of adverse effects, lower healthcare costs, and improved patient compliance through the use of a single medication administered once daily. Currently available fixed-dose agents include several combinations with complementary pharmacodynamic activity. This article reviews the fixed-dose antihypertensive combinations currently available in the US, and assesses the published literature comparing fixed-dose combinations with co-administration of two separate drugs or with other combinations. An analysis of the published literature between 1987 and 2007 reveals that most studies of fixed-dose antihypertensive combinations have compared the combination with monotherapy (53%); many fewer published papers have compared a fixed combination with coadministration of similar drugs as separate agents (2%), a fixed combination with another fixed combination from the same class (7%), or with a combination of agents from a different class (9%). Other comparisons have been with placebo, baseline or between generic formulations. This analysis indicates that: (i) physicians can be assured that a fixed-dose combination is more effective than either agent given as monotherapy; (ii) there is a paucity of data comparing different fixed-dose combinations; and (iii) very few studies have investigated the impact of fixed-dose combinations on achievement of BP goals, including both systolic BP and diastolic BP. For clinical decision making, physicians should rely on how the agents perform when administered together in add-on studies and how each component performs as monotherapy in reducing BP, achieving BP goals and reducing outcomes, as well as considering patient factors such as response to and tolerance of such agents as monotherapy and cost. The availability of effective and well tolerated fixed-dose combination antihypertensive agents should encourage primary-care physicians to be more willing to use such therapies in a timely manner when BP goals are not being achieved with monotherapy. This approach would improve BP control rates in the US and worldwide.", 
    "916": "Hypertension, one of the major treatable cardiovascular (CV) risk factors, usually occurs in association with other major risk factors. As well as providing rapid blood pressure (BP) goal attainment, antihypertensive therapy should also provide reductions in CV events and mortality in a wide range of patients. For this, higher dosages and combinations of antihypertensive agents are often required. ACE inhibitors are recommended as first-line agents for control of hypertension in patients with additional CV risk factors. The PEACH (Perindopril's Effect At Controlling Hypertension) study was a community-based study performed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of high-dose perindopril in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension and additional risk factors for CV disease.", 
    "917": "This was an open-label, multicentre observational study conducted in Canadian general practice clinics. The study assessed the efficacy and tolerability of perindopril given once daily for 10 weeks uptitrated to the maximal recommended dose of perindopril as required for BP control in newly diagnosed or previously treated patients with uncontrolled mild to moderate hypertension and >or=1 additional risk factor. Patients not achieving target BP after 2 weeks of therapy were uptitrated from perindopril 4 mg to perindopril 8 mg once daily. Efficacy endpoints included reduction in systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) BP and BP control. Tolerability assessments included adverse effects and physicians' assessment of tolerability. The number of missed doses was also recorded.", 
    "918": "Overall, 2220 patients with hypertension and >or=1 other risk factor were prescribed perindopril at 291 centres; 51.9% were male, 78.3% Caucasian, 12.8% Asian, 36.2%>or=65 years of age and 34.5% had uncontrolled BP despite previous antihypertensive treatment. Compared with previously treated patients, treatment-naive patients had fewer risk factors, and a higher proportion were Asian (p<0.05 for all comparisons). Most patients (76%) had 1-2 risk factors. Perindopril produced significant SBP/DBP reductions at 2 and 10 weeks (-15.8/-8.0 and -21.1/-11.0 mmHg, respectively). Overall, at week 10, BP control rate was 53.6%, better than at week 2 in the overall cohort and in all subgroups. Uptitration to high-dose perindopril to achieve BP control was required in 46% of patients with one additional risk factor compared with 64% of patients with >or=4 additional risk factors. These results demonstrate that the more risk factors the patient has, the greater the need for high-dose perindopril to achieve BP control. Perindopril was well tolerated as indicated by the high proportion of physicians (95.9%) reporting 'good' to 'excellent' tolerability at week 10.", 
    "919": "In this community-based clinical practice trial, up to 10 weeks' perindopril therapy, uptitrated to the maximal recommended dose as required for BP control, significantly reduced SBP/DBP in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension and additional CV risk factors. Patients with more risk factors were more likely to require high-dose perindopril.", 
    "920": "All patients with suspected angina need rapidly further cardiological examinations to check the diagnosis and fix the prognosis (at least clinical and risk factor evaluations and a resting ECG). The initial non-invasive strategy should include an echocardiography and a stress test (exercise ECG, stress echocardiography or perfusion scintigraphy), followed, in the majority of cases, by a coronary angiography. Lifestyle changes are mandatory and are fully part of secondary prevention: cigarette smoking withdrawal, mediterranean diet (fruit, vegetables, fish and poultry), weight loss, moderate alcohol consumption, increased omega-3 fatty acids and regular physical activity. Pharmacological therapy of stable coronary artery disease should associate short-acting nitrates (in case of angina), and systematically aspirin and statin. A beta-blocker should be used as a first-line therapy, particularly in the post-infarction setting or in case of left ventricular dysfunction. In case of contraindication, a calcium inhibitor or a long-acting nitrate should be choosen. ACE inhibitors are indicated in patients with left ventricular dysfunction, hypertension or diabetes and should also be considered in high-risk patients. The combination aspirin plus clopidogrel is required for at least one month after insertion of a nude stent, 12 months after an active stent or an acute coronary syndrome.",

In their 'Remission Clinic' in Bergamo, Italy, Ruggenenti et al. implemented an individual titration regimen using ramipril 5-10 mg/day, losartan 50-100 mg/day, verapamil 80-120 mg/day and atorvastatin 10-20 mg/day in successive steps, aiming for a low blood pressure target of <120/80 mmHg and a proteinuria target of <0.3 g/day. They found that patients treated in the Remission Clinic had a much slower decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate than a matched historical reference group treated with 1.25-5.00 mg ramipril (diastolic blood pressure goal <90 mmHg). Only 3.6% of Remission Clinic patients reached end-stage renal disease, compared with 30.4% of the historical controls. No information was provided on the individual responses to the different titration steps; therefore, the contributions of the specific components of the regimen towards the therapeutic benefit cannot be established. The data do, however, encourage an individualized and more active approach to preventing end-stage renal disease in individuals with proteinuric chronic kidney disease.",

Clinical parameters, echocardiographic measurement, renal function, and prescriptions were examined before and 3 months after CRT, and the relationship between the response to CRT and renal function was examined. The responders had a better prognosis than the non-responders (p<0.05). There was a significant difference in the change in the estimated glomerular filtration rate between the responders and non-responders (p<0.05), even in patients with renal dysfunction before CRT (p<0.01).

    "925": "Asymmetrical dimethylarginine (ADMA) is thought to be an endogenous regulator of arteriolar tone by inhibiting NO synthase. However, our previous studies showed that, in isolated arterioles, ADMA induced superoxide production as well. Thus, the mechanisms by which ADMA affects arteriolar tone remain obscure. We hypothesized that ADMA, by activating NAD(P)H oxidase, increases superoxide production, interfering with NO mediation of flow-induced dilation. In the presence of indomethacin, isolated arterioles from rat gracilis muscle ( approximately 160 microm at 80 mm Hg) were incubated with ADMA (10(-4) mol/L), which elicited significant constriction (from 162+/-4 to 143+/-4 microm) and eliminated the dilations to increases in intraluminal flow (from a maximum 31+/-2% to 3+/-1%; P<0.05). In the presence of ADMA, superoxide dismutase plus catalase restored dilations to flow (from a maximum 3+/-1% to 28+/-2%). Endothelial denudation or incubation of arterioles with the NAD(P)H oxidase inhibitor apocynin or the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor quinapril inhibited ADMA-induced constriction. In addition, apocynin, quinapril, or the angiotensin type 1 receptor blocker losartan restored flow-induced dilations reduced by ADMA. Furthermore, inhibition of NO synthase abolished the \"superoxide dismutase/catalase-restored\" flow-induced dilation in the presence of ADMA. ADMA-induced increased production of superoxide, assessed by dihydroethidium fluorescence, was inhibited by apocynin, quinapril, or losartan. We suggest that ADMA activates the local renin-angiotensin system, and the angiotensin II released activates NAD(P)H oxidase; superoxide produced interferes with the bioavailability of NO, resulting in diminished flow-induced dilation, a mechanism that may contribute to the development of arteriolar dysfunction and increased tone associated with elevated ADMA levels.",

Increasing age, female sex, history of peripheral artery disease, current smoking, and oral hypoglycemic or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy were independently associated with higher urinary concentrations of 11-dehydro thromboxane B(2), whereas aspirin dose > or =150 mg/d, history of treatment with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, history of hypercholesterolemia, and statin treatment were associated with lower concentrations.

Retrospective studies found an increased frequency of pre-term births and small full-term infants but the frequency of miscarriage and neonatal survival rate did not differ from healthy controls. The worst life-threatening complication of a pregnancy is scleroderma renal crisis. The use of ACE inhibitors is recommended in this case despite the risk of teratogenicity. In order to avoid complications, pregnancies in SSc should be planned when the disease is stable, and should be avoided in rapidly progressing diffuse SSc who are at a greater risk for developing serious cardiopulmonary and renal problems early in the disease. Hydroxychloroquine and low doses of steroids may be safely used. In order to minimize risks, a multidisciplinary approach is necessary to suggest the best timing for a pregnancy and provide adequate supportive treatment to SSc patients during the pregnancy.",

The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are used widely as antihypertensive agents, and it has been suggested that they decrease the risk of some cancers, although available data are conflicting. Accordingly, we investigated the anticancer activity of the ACE inhibitor, captopril, in athymic mice injected with highly tumorigenic LNM35 human lung cells as xenografts. Using this model, we demonstrated that daily IP administration of captopril (2.8 mg/mouse) for 3 weeks resulted in a remarkable reduction of tumor growth (58%, P < 0.01) and lymph node metastasis (50%, P= 0.088). There were no undesirable effects of captopril treatment on animal behavior and body weight. In order to determine the mechanism by which captopril inhibited tumor growth, we investigated the impact of this drug on cell proliferation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that captopril treatment significantly reduced the number of proliferating cells (Ki-67) in the tumor samples but was not associated with inhibition of tumor angiogenesis (CD31). Using cell viability and fluorescent activated cell sorting analysis tests, we demonstrated that captopril inhibited the viability of LNM35 cells by inducing apoptosis, providing insight about the mechanisms underlying its antitumorigenic activities. In view of these experimental findings, we conclude that captopril could be a promising option for the treatment of lung cancer.", 
    "940": "The sympathetic nervous system and renin-angiotensin system are both thought to contribute to the development and maintenance of hypertension in experimental models such as the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR). We demonstrated that periarterial nerve stimulation (NS) increased the perfusion pressure (PP) and neuropeptide Y (NPY) overflow from perfused mesenteric arterial beds of SHRs at 4-6, 10-12, and 18-20 wk of age, which correspond to prehypertensive, developing hypertensive, and maintained hypertensive stages, respectively, in the SHR. NS also increased PP and NPY overflow from mesenteric beds of Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) normotensive rats. NS-induced increases in PP and NPY were greater in vessels obtained from SHRs of all three ages compared with WKY rats. ANG II produced a greater increase in PP in preparations taken from SHRs than WKY rats. ANG II also resulted in a greater increase in basal NPY overflow from 10- to 12-wk-old and 18- to 20-wk-old SHRs than age-matched WKY rats. ANG II enhanced the NS-induced overflow of NPY from SHR preparations more than WKY controls at all ages studied. The enhancement of NS-induced NPY overflow by ANG II was blocked by the AT1 receptor antagonist EMD-66684 and the angiotensin type 2 receptor antagonist PD-123319. In contrast, ANG II greatly enhanced norepinephrine overflow in the presence of PD-123319. Both captopril and EMD-66684 decreased neurotransmitter overflow from SHR mesenteric beds; therefore, we conclude that an endogenous renin-angiotensin system is active in this preparation. It is concluded that the ANG II-induced enhancement of sympathetic nerve stimulation may contribute to the development and maintenance of hypertension in the SHR.",

Although clinical trials demonstrated a rather consistent beneficial effect of ACE inhibitors across groups of patients based on clinical characteristics, the variability in treatment response on the individual patient level is extensive. Recent publications suggest that genetic polymorphisms in the RAAS are related to cardiovascular risk.

They have yielded contradictory results, showing hyperalgesia in some studies but analgesia in others. Hence this study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of Ramipril (an ACE-I) and Losartan (an ARB) on pain perception in human volunteers using cola caps and handcuff of sphygmomanometer. A total of 30 healthy, normotensive individuals with no previous history of intake of analgesics during or 4 weeks prior to the study were selected after an informed consent. The first group received a single dose of placebo, the second group received Ramipril (2.5 mg) & the third group received Losartan (50 mg). Pain perception threshold (the point at which an individual first experiences pain) and the maximum tolerated pain were assessed using the above method. The control group showed no significant changes in pain threshold, but the group receiving either Ramipril or Losartan showed a decline in threshold for maximum tolerated pain. Only Ramipril and not Losartan decreased the pain perception threshold.

Many new aspects of this system have been revealed in recent years, leading to new therapeutic approaches. It's well known that RAS blocking agents have potent antiatherosclerotic effects, which are mediated by their antihypertensive, anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative, and oxidative stress lowering properties. Inhibitors of RAS are now first-line treatments for hypertensive target organ damage. Their effects are greater than expected by their ability to lower blood pressure. Angiotensin receptor blockers reduce the frequency of atrial fibrillation and stroke, are also able to prevent cardiovascular and renal events in diabetic patients. Thus, blockade of RAS represents one of the most important strategies in order to reduce cardiovascular risk.", 
    "958": "The study has been designed to investigate the effect of benfotiamine and fenofibrate in diabetes-induced experimental vascular endothelial dysfunction (VED) and nephropathy. The single administration of streptozotocin (STZ) (50 mg/kg, i.p.) produced diabetes, which was noted to develop VED and nephropathy in 8 weeks. The diabetes produced VED by attenuating acetylcholine-induced endothelium dependent relaxation, impairing the integrity of vascular endothelium, decreasing serum nitrite/nitrate concentration and increasing serum TBARS and aortic superoxide anion generation. Further, diabetes altered the lipid profile by increasing the serum cholesterol, triglycerides and decreasing the high density lipoprotein. The nephropathy was noted to be developed in the diabetic rat that was assessed in terms of increase in serum creatinine, blood urea, proteinuria, and glomerular damage. The benfotiamine (70 mg/kg, p.o.) and fenofibrate (32 mg/kg, p.o.) or lisinopril (1 mg/kg, p.o., a standard agent) treatments were started in diabetic rats after 1 week of STZ administration and continued for 7 weeks. The treatment with benfotiamine and fenofibrate either alone or in combination attenuated diabetes-induced VED and nephropathy. In addition, the combination of benfotiamine and fenofibrate was noted to be more effective in attenuating the diabetes-induced VED and nephropathy when compared to treatment with either drug alone or lisinopril. Treatment with fenofibrate normalizes the altered lipid profile in diabetic rats, whereas benfotiamine treatment has no effect on lipid alteration in diabetic rats. It may be concluded that diabetes-induced oxidative stress, lipids alteration, and consequent development of VED may be responsible for the induction of nephropathy in diabetic rats. Concurrent administration of benfotiamine and fenofibrate may provide synergistic benefits in preventing the development of diabetes-induced nephropathy by reducing the oxidative stress and lipid alteration, preventing the VED and subsequently improving the renal function.",

A comprehensive physical examination was conducted to obtain baseline information about the patient: clinical status, lipid profile, microalbuminuria and urine creatinine, as well as glycemia levels. Patients were treated with Candesartan (16 or 32 mg) or placebo. When necessary, other antihypertensive agents (except ACE-inhibitors) were initiated. Eye fundus monitoring was performed with evaluation of 7,300 standard zone stereoscopic pictures of the retina according to ETDRS (Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study). The results of three year observation revealed no pathologic changes on the retina in normotensive and normoglycemic pts; pts with mild diabetic retinopathy at baseline demonstrated normal levels of ABP and blood glucose which resulted in the regression of the changes. The changes of various severity demonstrated no positive shifts in 96% of cases; DR deterioration (proliferative DR, neovascularisation stage) was observed in 4% of cases. Results of the study showed that Candesartan treatment of pts with DM resulted in positive shifts in the pathologic changes, registered on the retina and decrease in urine albumin excretion rate.

Single antihypertensive agent was used in the majority of patients (64.1%). In a small number of patients (42, 38.9%) undergoing ABPM during antihypertensive therapy, the adequacy of control of HTN was very poor.", 
    "965": "Neurohormonal activation and increased sympathetic stimulation are among the factors that have been linked to the development and progression of left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) and heart failure (HF) in post-myocardial infarction (MI) patients. Various available pharmacologic therapies can target these factors and improve many aspects of the disease, depending on the degree of LVD. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines recommend angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-blockers, and aldosterone antagonists because of their proven favorable effects on symptoms, left ventricular function, cardiac remodeling, hospitalization rates, and survival. However, they are not being used in over two thirds of patients with post-MI LVD. This review illustrates the impact of these therapies on post-MI LVD patients using evidence from multiple clinical trials. In addition, current and emerging treatments for acute decompensated HF will be outlined.",

    "968": "Of the 1418 patients included in this post-hoc analysis, 686 (48.3%) had MS. After 6 weeks of treatment zofenopril significantly reduced the incidence of all-cause death and severe congestive failure (risk reduction: 69%, 95% CI: 7-78; 2p=0.002) in MS+ patients. This was the case for 1-year mortality, too (29%, 95% CI: 4-41; 2p=0.048).

While attempts have been made to standardize the method to characterize the intraoperative hemodynamics, these methods still vary widely. In addition, there is a lack of consensus concerning treatment thresholds and appropriate therapeutic targets, making absolute recommendations about treatment difficult. Nevertheless, perioperative hypertension requires careful management. When treatment is necessary, therapy should be individualized for the patient.

The optimal hypertensive drug regimen to reduce aortic events was determined by multivariate analyses. Of the 78 patients, 73 (94%) were discharged from hospital with medical therapy, and aortic events occurred in 13 (18%) of them (aortic rupture/recurrent dissection in 2 (3%); aortic expansion >or=60 mm in 7 (10%), rapid aortic expansion >or=10 mm/year in 3 (4%), and development of visceral/limb ischemia in 1 (1%)) during follow-up.

Studies carried out to date have indicated that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) reduce urinary protein excretion and preserve renal function in adult IgA-N. However, no prospective study of ACEI only for childhood IgA-N has yet been carried out. In this prospective single-arm pilot trial, we administered lisinopril (0.4 mg/kg per day) as therapeutic treatment to 40 children with mild IgA-N with proteinuria [morning urinary protein/creatinine ratio (uP/Cr) >or= 0.2 g/g]. Thirty-three patients reached the primary endpoint (uP/Cr < 0.2) during the 2-year treatment period. The cumulative disappearance rate of proteinuria determined by the Kaplan-Meier method was 80.9%. Mean uP excretion was reduced from 0.40 to 0.18 g/m(2)/day (p < 0.0001). Of the 40 patients treated, five (12.5%) showed dizziness, and four of these five needed the lisinopril dose reduced. However, lisinopril therapy was continued in all patients during the 2-year treatment period. No other side effect, such as cough, was observed. We conclude that the efficacy and safety of lisinopril is seemingly acceptable for the treatment of children with mild IgA-N.", 
    "989": "Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a common complication of connective tissue disease. While there are no reliable epidemiological data, the prevalence of systemic sclerosis (SSc) has been estimated as being 8-12%. Mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) and systemic lupus erythematodes (SLE) are thought to have a lower prevalence. PH associated with SSc has a poor prognosis, a two-year survival rate of approximately 50%, if untreated. Systematic literature search for studies of PH and CTD between 02/2007 and 02/2008 found 38 articles, a selection of which is reviewed here. One epidemiological study showed that nowadays PH is together with interstitial pulmonary fibrosis the most common cause of death in patients with SSc. Before the introduction of angiotensin- converting enzyme inhibitors the most frequent cause of death was acute renal crisis. Investigations of the pathogenesis of PH in CTD revealed that in patients with a severe, treatment-resistant course there is frequent histological evidence of pulmonary veno-occlusive disease. A prospective study on diagnosis revealed that transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is better than magnetic resonance imaging or pulmonary function tests especially in screening for PH in patients with SSc, because of its high specificity and good predictive value at higher pulmonary pressures. But because of the low sensitivity of TTE right heart catheterization is the gold standard for verifying PH also in patients with SSc. A therapeutic uncontrolled trial indicated that treatment with bosentan combined with sildenafil results in clinical stabilization, but patients with idiopathic PHT responded better.",

The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of RAS inhibitors on the apoptosis of acinar cells and pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) elimination in experimental CP induced by dibutyltin dichloride (DBTC). CP was induced by administration of DBTC to the femoral vein. Simultaneously captopril, losartan, enalapril and lisinopril were administered intraperitoneally. The rats were decapitated after 60 days and tissue of pancreas was collected. In rats treated by DBTC the features of inflammatory infiltration, ductal lumen dilatation, fibrosis were found. Strong reactivity with caspase2(L) and clusterin-beta antibodies was observed in areas of fibrosis. In animals treated with RAS inhibitors inflammatory changes and fibrosis were less severe. In groups of rats treated with DBTC and RAS inhibitors immunoreactivity of caspase(2L) and clusterin-beta was weak. Positive immunostaining against smooth muscle actine and desmin was observed in the elongated cells (PSC-s). This reaction was weak in groups of rat treated with DBTC and RAS inhibitors. Treatment of CP rats with RAS inhibitors alleviate apoptosis of pancreatic acinar cells and induces PSCs elimination.", 
    "991": "Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) frequently occurs in children under 15 years of age but is quite rare in adults. Most children who develop HSP nephritis completely recover from the illness, whereas up to 40% of adults have persistent hematuria and 10% develop chronic renal failure. Plasma exchange alone has been shown to be beneficial in children who have HSP nephritis. Adults have been treated using immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclophosphamide but effects are not certain. Here, we present a case of a 59-year-old white male who developed HSP nephritis while undergoing treatment with steroids. The patient developed acute renal failure with proteinuria and hematuria \u223c2 weeks after being initially diagnosed with HSP by skin biopsy. Renal biopsy showed proliferative, exudative glomerulonephritis involving all 20 glomeruli; some with early crescent formation. Immunofluorescence staining showed 3+ IgA deposits in mesangium suggesting HSP-induced GN. The patient's serum creatinine rose to 2.5 mg/dl with \u223c5 g of proteinuria by dipstick. Steroids were continued and the patient received plasma exchange treatments. Due to a very low leukocyte count, immunosuppressive agents were not given. Subsequently, renal function improved and the creatinine level came down to 1.3 mg/dl and proteinuria to <1 g/24 h. Since then, 1 year after this event, his serum creatinine has continued to stay at 1.2 mg/dl and he has trace proteinuria while taking a low-dose ACE inhibitor. This case illustrates the usefulness of plasma exchange in adult onset HSP nephritis, even without concomitant use of cytotoxic agents.",

These drug-induced disorders are relatively common, typically including hyponatraemia, hypokalaemia, hyperkalaemia, hypomagnesaemia, hypophosphataemia and hypercalcaemia. Diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers are particularly likely to cause these complications. Recognised risk factors include high-dosage regimens (especially diuretics), old age, diabetes and impairment of renal function.

    "997": "Secondary prevention in patients with coronary heart disease includes treatment with platelet inhibitors, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors or AT (1)-blockers, and statins. Initiation of therapy generally does not require a slow gradual dose increase. In treatment naive patients with acute coronary syndromes, administration of a loading dose of aspirin and/or clopidogrel is recommended. To reduce flushing, nicotinic acid should be initiated at low stepwise increasing dosages. beta-blocker therapy should not be stopped acutely in coronary heart disease patients. If beta-blocker therapy has to be terminated, blood pressure should be monitored closely and, if necessary controlled with other medication. Termination of statin therapy in the acute phase after strokes or acute coronary syndromes is associated with increased cardiovascular events and should therefore be avoided.",

    "999": "On the basis of exploratory factor analysis, six multidimensional patterns of 516 amino acid attributes, namely, factor analysis scales of generalized amino acid information (FASGAI) involving hydrophobicity, alpha and turn propensities, bulky properties, compositional characteristics, local flexibility and electronic properties, are proposed to represent structures of 48 bitter-tasting dipeptides and 58 angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Characteristic parameters related to bioactivities of the peptides studied are selected by genetic algorithm, and quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models are constructed by partial least square (PLS). Our results by a leave-one-out cross validation are compared with the previously known structure representation method and are shown to give slightly superior or comparative performance. Further, two data sets are divided into training sets and test sets to validate the characterization repertoire of FASGAI. Performance of the PLS models developed by training samples by a leave-one-out cross validation and external validation for test samples are satisfying. These results demonstrate that FASGAI is an effective representation technique of peptide structures, and that FASGAI vectors have many preponderant characteristics such as straightforward physicochemical information, high characterization competence and easy manipulation. They can be further applied to investigate the relationship between structures and functions of various peptides, even proteins.", 
    "1000": "Acute intravenous infusion of ranolazine (Ran), an anti-ischemic/antiangina drug, was previously shown to improve left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) without a concomitant increase in myocardial oxygen consumption in dogs with chronic heart failure (HF). This study examined the effects of treatment with Ran alone and in combination with metoprolol (Met) or enalapril (Ena) on LV function and remodeling in dogs with HF. Dogs (n = 28) with microembolization-induced HF were randomized to 3 mo oral treatment with Ran alone [375 mg twice daily (bid); n = 7], Ran (375 mg bid) in combination with Met tartrate (25 mg bid; n = 7), Ran (375 mg bid) in combination with Ena (10 mg bid; n = 7), or placebo (PL; Ran vehicle bid; n = 7). Ventriculographic measurements of LV end-diastolic volume (EDV) and end-systolic volume (ESV) and LV EF were obtained before treatment and after 3 mo of treatment. In PL-treated dogs, EDV and ESV increased significantly. Ran alone prevented the increase in EDV and ESV seen in the PL group and significantly increased EF, albeit modestly, from 35 +/- 1% to 37 +/- 2%. When combined with either Ena or Met, Ran prevented the increase in EDV, significantly decreased ESV, and markedly increased EF compared with those of PL. EF increased from 35 +/- 1% to 40 +/- 1% with Ran + Ena and from 34 +/- 1% to 41 +/- 1% with Ran + Met. Ran alone or in combination with Ena or Met was also associated with beneficial effects at the cellular level on histomorphometric parameters such as hypertrophy, fibrosis, and capillary density as well as the expression for pathological hypertrophy and Ca2+ cycling genes. In conclusion, Ran prevented progressive LV dysfunction and global and cellular myocardial remodeling, and Ran in combination with Ena or Met improved LV function beyond that observed with Ran alone.", 
    "1001": "Angiotensin II blockade delays progression of chronic kidney disease by modifying intrarenal hemodynamics, but the effects on metabolic adaptations are unknown. Using the remnant kidney model of chronic kidney disease in rats, we measured the effects of combined angiotensin II blockade with captopril and losartan on renal oxygen consumption (QO(2)) and factors influencing QO(2). Remnant kidneys had proteinuria and reductions in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal blood flow (RBF) and nitric oxide synthase-1 protein expression while QO(2), factored by sodium reabsorption (QO(2)/TNa), was markedly increased. Combined blockade treatment normalized these parameters while increasing sodium reabsorption but, since QO(2) was unchanged, QO(2)/TNa also normalized. Triple antihypertensive therapy, to control blood pressure, and treatment with lysine, to increase GFR and RBF, did not normalize QO(2)/TNa, suggesting a specific effect of angiotensin II in elevating QO(2)/TNa. Inhibition of nitric oxide synthase increased QO(2) in the kidney of sham-operated rats but not in the remnant kidney of untreated rats. Our study shows that combined captopril and losartan treatment normalized QO(2)/TNa and functional nitric oxide activity in the remnant kidney independent of blood pressure and GFR effects, suggesting that other mechanisms in addition to hemodynamics underlie the benefits of angiotensin II blockade.", 
    "1002": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is a highly pathogenic emergent virus which replicates in cells that can express ABH histo-blood group antigens. The heavily glycosylated SARS-CoV spike (S) protein binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 which serves as a cellular receptor. Epidemiological analysis of a hospital outbreak in Hong Kong revealed that blood group O was associated with a low risk of infection. In this study, we used a cellular model of adhesion to investigate whether natural antibodies of the ABO system could block the S protein and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 interaction. To this aim, a C-terminally EGFP-tagged S protein was expressed in chinese hamster ovary cells cotransfected with an alpha1,2-fucosyltransferase and an A-transferase in order to coexpress the S glycoprotein ectodomain and the A antigen at the cell surface. We observed that the S protein/angiotensin-converting enzyme 2-dependent adhesion of these cells to an angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 expressing cell line was specifically inhibited by either a monoclonal or human natural anti-A antibodies, indicating that these antibodies may block the interaction between the virus and its receptor, thereby providing protection. In order to more fully appreciate the potential effect of the ABO polymorphism on the epidemiology of SARS, we built a mathematical model of the virus transmission dynamics that takes into account the protective effect of ABO natural antibodies. The model indicated that the ABO polymorphism could contribute to substantially reduce the virus transmission, affecting both the number of infected individuals and the kinetics of the epidemic.", 
    "1003": "High blood pressure or hypertension is a condition affecting many individuals and represents a controllable risk factor for cardiovascular diseases such as coronary heart disease and stroke. A non-pharmacological approach to manage these includes the application of food components with antihypertensive activity. Milk protein-derived peptides have been exploited as natural hypotensive agents, namely the peptides Val-Pro-Pro (VPP) and Ile-Pro-Pro (IPP), already commercialized in functional foods as a potential alternative to synthetic drugs. These bioactive peptides inhibit in vitro and in vivo the Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE), a protein with an important role in blood pressure regulation. In this work, we attempted to elucidate the possible mode of interaction between the peptides and ACE, including mechanisms of binding to the cofactor Zn2+, and further contrast this with the known mode of inhibition exerted by synthetic drugs (Captopril, Enalaprilat and Lisinopril). The bioactive peptide Ala-Leu-Pro-Met-His-Ile-Arg (ALPMHIR), also known to inhibit the enzyme ACE but with a lower efficiency than VPP and IPP, was utilized in the docking studies for comparison. It was observed that the best docking poses obtained for VPP and IPP were located at the ACE catalytic site with very high resemblance to the drugs mode of interaction, including the coordination with Zn2+. As for ALPMHIR, the best docking poses were located in the narrow ACE channel outside the catalytic site, representing higher affinity energies and fewer resemblances with the interaction established by drugs."
