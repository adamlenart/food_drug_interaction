The synthetic replicate peptides were subjected to a range of biological assays: hemolytic, antifungal, antiviral, electrophysiological, immunological and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition activities. All venom peptides neither showed to be cytolytic nor demonstrated significant antifungal or antiviral activities. Interestingly, peptides were able to modulate macrophages' responses, increasing IL-6 production. The three venom peptides also demonstrated potential to inhibit ACE in the following order: 7.2>7.1>8. The ACE inhibition activity was unexpected, since peptides that display this function are usually proline-rich peptides. In attempt to understand the origin of such small peptides, we discovered that the isolated peptides 7.2 and 8 are fragments of the same molecule, named Pape peptide precursor. Furthermore, the study discusses that Pape fragments could be originated from a post-splitting mechanism resulting from metalloserrulases and other proteinases cleavage, which can be seen as a clever mechanism used by the scorpion to enlarge its repertoire of venom components. Scorpion venom remains as an interesting source of bioactive proteins and this study advances our knowledge about three NDBPs and their biological activities.",

In view of the recent increase in the prevalence of renal failure, we have investigated the effect of HS consumption on renal function in Nigerians with mild to moderate hypertension. A total of 78 newly diagnosed but untreated subjects with mild to moderate hypertension attending the medical outpatients unit of Enugu State University Teaching Hospital (Enugu, Nigeria) were recruited for the study. These subjects were randomly divided into three equally sized groups that received HS or lisinopril (treatment groups) or placebo (control group), once daily for 4\u00a0weeks. Indices of renal function (urine volume and creatinine clearance) were measured at baseline and weekly throughout the study period. HS and lisinopril significantly increased (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) urine volume compared to placebo, and HS significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) increased urine volume more than lisinopril. HS significantly increased (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) creatinine clearance compared to placebo whereas lisinopril did not. These results indicate that HS consumption improved indices of renal function in our study population of Nigerians with mild to moderate hypertension.",

Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors plus calcium channel blockers are the recommended first-line treatments in hypertensive diabetic patients; however, the effect in reducing CBP when a dose is skipped has not been established yet. The aim was to determine whether the fixed-dose combination of olmesartan/amlodipine (OLM/AML) provides equal efficacy and safety as the perindopril/AML (PER/AML) combination in reducing CBP, augmentation index (AIx), and pulse wave velocity (PWV) when a drug dose is missed.",

    "6": "The prevention and the treatment with drugs interacting with the renin-angiotensin system (RAAS) are one of the greatest successes of the pharmacological research in the last years. Many trials demonstrated the efficacy of ARBs and ACEi in preventing or reducing the progression of albuminuria, the loss of kidney function and the mortality in diabetic population.The rationale for applying a dual RAAS blockade is based on data showing that ACEi mono-therapy produces an incomplete RAAS blockade with angiotensin I and renin accumulation and the subsequent angiotensin II 'escape' production by non-ACE pathways. The use of ARBs and ACEi in combination could lead to a stronger RAAS block and consequently to a more effective nephroprotection. Years ago, some studies performed in small groups of patients with diabetic nephropathy confirmed the effectiveness of this pharmacological approach.In contrast recent important trials, like ONTARGET, ALTITUDE and VA NEPHRON-D failed to demonstrate the effectiveness of this therapeutic strategy, suggesting that probably not all the diabetic patients with nephropathy should be considered equal as regard the response to this therapy. These 3 long-term studies showed that the dual blockade of RAAS may bring cardiovascular and renal adverse events, even in presence of a reduction of albuminuria. Dual blockade of RAAS is not currently feasible in patients with diabetic nephropathy, but we consider that the effort to try to apply a complete RAAS blockade should be pursued and that probably through an accurate selection of patients in the future we could reconsider this kind of therapy.",

    "12": "Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is one of the most important causes of the end-stage renal failure and its prevalence is found to be increasing. The presence of hypertension and progressive proteinuria is among the important findings. In this study, the effects of double and triple combinations of trandolapril, telmisartan, and verapamil on proteinuria were investigated in diabetic patients with nephropathy. Seventy-eight patients (mean age: 56.11 \u00b1 11.26 years; 47 females and 31 males) with overt proteinuria and DN were included in this study. The patients were divided into four groups: Group I (n: 18, trandolapril + telmisartan), Group II (n: 20, trandolapril + verapamil), Group III (n: 20, trandolapril +telmisartan + verapamil), and Group IV (n: 20, telmisartan + verapamil). At the end of a three-month therapy, within and between group comparisons were done about the effects of the use of double or triple drug combinations on proteinuria, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), electrolytes, serum albumin, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)- cholesterol, and HbA1C. There was no significant difference among groups in terms of age, gender, diabetes duration, body mass index, and retinopathy frequency. The decreases in proteinuria and mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) were significant in all groups. The decrease in proteinuria was independent of the decrease in MABP [the reduction rate in proteinuria was 39% (P <0.001) in Group I, 37% (P <0.001) in Group II, 42% (P <0.001) in Group III, and 43% (P <0.001) in Group IV; the reduction rate in MABP was 10.6% (P <0.001) in Group I, 13.7% (P <0.001) in Group II, 17.5% (P <0.001) in Group III, and 15.4% (P <0.001) in Group IV]. Decrease in HbA1C (before and after treatment) was significant in Groups III and IV when com- pared to Groups I and II. Any adverse event, like hyperkalemia, was not observed. There was no significant difference among the groups in terms of GFR, LDL-cholesterol, albumin, and potassium. All the patients tolerated the drugs well. In conclusion, in patients with DN, both double or triple combinations of trandolapril, telmisartan and verapamil resulted in significant decreases in proteinuria and MABP. Triple combinations did not have any superiority over double combinations. Therefore, the suitable drug combinations may be chosen according to the clinical status of a patient.", 
    "13": "There are several possible uses of the Class II hydrophobin HFBII in clinical applications. To fully understand and exploit this potential however, the antioxidant activity and ACE-inhibitory potential of this protein need to be better understood and have not been previously reported. In this study, the Class II hydrophobin HFBII was produced by the cultivation of wild type Trichoderma reesei. The crude hydrophobin extract obtained from the fermentation process was purified using reversed-phase liquid chromatography and the identity of the purified HFBII verified by MALDI-TOF (molecular weight: 7.2kDa). Subsequently the antioxidant activities of different concentrations of HFBII (0.01-0.40mg/mL) were determined. The results show that for HFBII concentrations of 0.04mg/mL and upwards the protein significantly reduced the presence of ABTS(+) radicals in the medium, the IC50 value found to be 0.13mg/mL. Computational modeling highlighted the role of the amino acid residues located in the conserved and exposed hydrophobic patch on the surface of the HFBII molecule and the interactions with the aromatic rings of ABTS. The ACE-inhibitory effect of HFBII was found to occur from 0.5mg/mL and upwards, making the combination of HFBII with strong ACE-inhibitors attractive for use in the healthcare industry.", 
    "14": "Secondary hypertension occurs in a significant proportion of adult patients (~10%). In young patients, renal causes (glomerulonephritis) and coarctation of the aorta should be considered. In older patients, primary aldosteronism, obstructive sleep apnoea and renal artery stenosis are more prevalent than previously thought. Primary aldosteronism can be screened by taking morning aldosterone and renin levels, and should be considered in patients with severe, resistant or hypokalaemia-associated hypertension. Symptoms of obstructive sleep apnoea should be sought. Worsening of renal function after starting an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor suggests the possibility of renal artery stenosis. Recognition, diagnosis and treatment of secondary causes of hypertension lead to good clinical outcomes and the possible reversal of end-organ damage, in addition to blood pressure control. As most patients with hypertension are managed at the primary care level, it is important for primary care physicians to recognise these conditions and refer patients appropriately.", 
    "15": "Prenatal dexamethasone (DEX) exposure, postnatal high-fat (HF) intake, and arachidonic acid pathway are closely related to hypertension. We tested whether a soluble epoxide hydrolase (SEH) inhibitor, 12-(3-adamantan-1-yl-ureido)-dodecanoic acid (AUDA) or 15-deoxy-\u0394(12,14)-prostagandin J2 (15dPGJ2) therapy can rescue programmed hypertension in the DEX+HF two-hit model. Four groups of Sprague Dawley rats were studied: control, DEX+HF, AUDA, and 15dPGJ2. Dexamethasone (0.1mg/kg body weight) was intraperitoneally administered to pregnant rats from gestational day 16-22. Male offspring received high-fat diet (D12331, Research Diets) from weaning to 4 months of age. In AUDA group, mother rats received 25mg/L in drinking water during lactation. In the 15dPGJ2 group, male offspring received 15dPGJ2 1.5mg/kg BW by subcutaneous injection once daily for 1 week after birth. We found postnatal HF diet aggravated prenatal DEX-induced programmed hypertension, which was similarly prevented by early treatment with AUDA or 15dPGJ2. The beneficial effects of AUDA and 15d-PGJ2 therapy include inhibition of SEH, increases of renal angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) and angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT2R) protein levels, and restoration of nitric oxide bioavailability. Better understanding of the impact of arachidonic acid pathway in the two-hit model will help prevent programmed hypertension in children exposed to corticosteroids and postnatal HF intake.",

Antiplatelet therapy, statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, and beta-blockers were used by 73%, 60%, 57%, and 49% at admission for revascularization. CV event rate (a composite of myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or CV death) at 12, 24, and 36\u00a0months was 5.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.5-5.6), 9.5% (95% CI, 8.7-10.3), and 13.8% (95% CI, 12.8-14.8) in patients with IC and 16.8% (95% CI, 16.1-17.6), 25.9% (95% CI, 25.0-26.8), and 34.3% (95% CI, 33.2-35.4) in patients with CLI.

Conversely, until recently, potentially beneficial augmentation of neurohumoural systems such as the natriuretic peptides has had limited therapeutic success. Administration of synthetic natriuretic peptides has not improved outcomes in acute HF but modulation of the natriuretic system through inhibition of the enzyme that degrades natriuretic (and other vasoactive) peptides, neprilysin, has proven to be successful. After initial failures with neprilysin inhibition alone or dual neprilysin-angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition, the Prospective comparison of angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) with ACEI to Determine Impact on Global Mortality and morbidity in Heart Failure trial (PARADIGM-HF) trial demonstrated that morbidity and mortality can be improved with the angiotensin receptor blocker neprilysin inhibitor sacubitril/valsartan (formerly LCZ696). In comparison to the ACE inhibitor enalapril, sacubitril/valsartan reduced the occurrence of the primary end point (cardiovascular death or hospitalisation for HF) by 20% with a 16% reduction in all-cause mortality. These findings suggest that sacubitril/valsartan should replace an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker as the foundation of treatment of symptomatic patients (NYHA II-IV) with HF and a reduced ejection fraction. This review will explore the background to neprilysin inhibition in HF, the results of the PARADIGM-HF trial and offer guidance on how to use sacubitril/valsartan in clinical practice.",

    "35": "Moderate doses of perindopril (8mg) significantly reduced peak subjective ratings of anxious and stimulated as well as attenuated many other subjective effects produced by methamphetamine, likely by inhibiting angiotensin II synthesis. Angiotensin II is known to facilitate the effects of norepinephrine, which contributes to methamphetamine's subjective effects. The lack of a classic dose-response function likely results from either nonspecific effects of perindopril or from between-group differences that were not accounted for in the current study (i.e., genetic variations and/or caffeine use). The current findings suggest that while angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors can reduce some effects produced by methamphetamine, more consistent treatment effects might be achieved by targeting components of the renin-angiotensin system that are downstream of angiotensin-converting enzyme.", 
    "36": "During the last decade, hyperactivity of the sympathetic nervous and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone systems (SNS and RAAS, respectively) has repeatedly been related to the pathophysiology of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and PAH-related right ventricular failure (PAH-RVF), raising the question of whether neurohormonal inhibition may be indicated for these conditions. Experimental data indicate that the RAAS may be involved in pulmonary vascular remodeling, which is in fact halted by RAAS antagonism. Favorable actions of \u03b2-blockers on the pulmonary vasculature have also been described, even if information about \u03b2-adrenergic receptors in PAH is lacking. Furthermore, the available evidence suggests that stimulation of the pressure-overloaded RV by the SNS and RAAS is initially compensatory, but becomes maladaptive over time. Consistently, RV reverse remodeling has been shown in PAH animal models treated with either \u03b2-blockers or RAAS inhibitors, although important differences with human PAH may limit the translational value of these findings. Only few observational studies of neurohormonal antagonism in PAH and PAH-RVF have been published. Nonetheless, \u03b2-blockers on top of specific therapy appear to be safe and possibly also effective. The combination of mineralocorticoid receptor and endothelin-A receptor antagonists may result in an additive effect because of a positive pharmacodynamic interaction. While neurohormonal inhibitors cannot be recommended at present for treatment of PAH and PAH-RVF, they are worth being further investigated.",

    "45": "Introduction. The prognosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients has been improved with several treatments such as antithrombotics, beta-blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) as well as coronary revascularization. Influenza vaccination has been shown to reduce adverse outcomes in ACS, but no information exists regarding the interaction of other treatments. Methods. This study included 439 ACS patients from Phrommintikul et al. A single dose of inactivated influenza vaccine was given by intramuscular injection in the vaccination group. The cardiovascular outcomes were described as major cardiovascular events (MACEs) which included mortality, hospitalization due to ACS, and hospitalization due to heart failure (HF). The stratified and multivariable Cox's regression analysis was performed. Results. The stratified Cox's analysis by influenza vaccination for each cardiovascular outcome and discrimination of hazard ratios showed that beta-blockers had an interaction with influenza vaccination. Moreover, the multivariable hazard ratios disclosed that influenza vaccine is associated with a significant reduction of hospitalization due to HF in patients who received beta-blockers (HR = 0.05, 95% CI = 0.004-0.71, P = 0.027), after being adjusted for prognostic indicators (sex, dyslipidemia, serum creatinine, and left ventricular ejection fraction). Conclusions. The influenza vaccine was shown to significantly modify the effect of beta-blockers in ACS patients and to reduce the hospitalization due to HF. However, further study of a larger population and benefits to HF patients should be investigated.",

Subgroup analysis showed that ARB and ACEI were equally effective in preventing new-onset AF regardless of age, gender, the presence of heart failure, diabetes, and vascular disease, except for those with prior stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). ARB prevents new-onset AF better than ACEI in patients with a history of stroke or TIA (log-rank P\u200a=\u200a0.012).Both ARB and ACEI reduce new-onset AF in patients with hypertension.

To test the hypothesis, genetic material was collected from buccal cells, and serum was collected for biochemical analysis. Sixty-five patients were analyzed. The incorporation of protease inhibitor (PI) was more frequent in women (77% vs 33% in men). Nutritional intervention improved anthropometric parameters independent of the genotype. Patients with the RR genotype for the ACTN3 R577X polymorphism had lower glycemia (RR = 95.4 \u00b1 6.5 mg/dL, RX = 102.6 \u00b1 10.6 mg/dL, XX = 110.1 \u00b1 16.3 mg/dL; P = .03) and a greater reduction in low-density lipoproteins (LDL) after intervention (LDL: RR = -23.7 \u00b1 15.8 mg/dL, RX = 1.32 \u00b1 5.13 mg/dL, XX = 30.21 \u00b1 24.4 mg/dL; P = .01). Patients using PI had a negative response to dietary intervention regarding the levels of high-density lipoprotein (-2.4 \u00b1 1.70 with PI, 2.56 \u00b1 1.60 mg/dL without PI; P = .02), very low density lipoprotein (0.84 \u00b1 2.73 with IP, -5.46 \u00b1 3.37 mg/dL without PI; P = .03), and triglycerides (1.79 \u00b1 13.22 with PI, -34.00 \u00b1 17.67 mg/dL without PI; P = .052). This response was also independent of the genotype (P > 0.05) and suggested the need for oral lipid-lowering drugs in all HIV+ patients using PI.

Elevated plasma aldosterone often accompanies RAS blockade by a phenomenon known as \"aldosterone escape\" and activates the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR). We therefore examined whether addition of the MR antagonist eplerenone to an ACEI would enhance the efficacy in slowing the progression of DN. Untreated uninephrectomized diabetic db/db mice developed progressive albuminuria and glomerulosclerosis between weeks 18 and 22, associated with decreased number of podocytes and increased renal expression of fibrotic markers. The therapeutic effect of eplerenone at 100 mg/kg BW/d on albuminuria, podocyte injury and renal fibrosis was similar to that of enalapril given alone at maximally effective doses. Adding eplerenone to enalapril resulted in further reduction in these measurements. Renal expressions of TNF-\u03b1, MCP-1, Nox2 and p47phox and renal TBARS levels, markers of inflammation and oxidative stress, were increased during disease progression in diabetic mice, which were reduced by eplerenone or enalapril given alone and further reduced by the two drugs given in combination. However, there were no treatment related effects on plasma K+. Our results suggest that eplerenone is effective in slowing the progression of DN in db/db mice and that the effect is additive to an ACEI. The addition of an MR antagonist void of effects on plasma K+ to an ACEI may offer additional renoprotection in progressive DN via blocking the effects of aldosterone due to escape or diabetes-induction.",

ACE inhibitors are used to treat diseases such as hypertension and heart failure. It is thus highly desirable to understand the catalytic mechanism of ACE, as this should facilitate the design of more powerful and selective ACE inhibitors. ACE exhibits two different active domains, the C-domain and the N-domain. In this work, we systematically investigated the inhibitor- and substrate-binding patterns in the N-domain of human ACE using a combined quantum mechanical and molecular mechanical approach. The hydrolysis of hippuryl-histidyl-leucine (HHL) as catalyzed by the N-domain of human somatic ACE was explored, and the effects of chloride ion on the overall reaction were also investigated. Two models, one with and one without a chloride ion at the first binding position, were then designed to examine the chloride dependence of inhibitor-substrate binding and the catalytic mechanism. Our calculations indicate that the hydrolysis reaction follows a stepwise general base/general acid catalysis path. The estimated mean free energy barrier height in the two models is about 15.6\u00a0kcal/mol, which agrees very well with the experimentally estimated value of 15.8\u00a0kcal/mol. Our simulations thus suggest that the N-domain is in a mixed form during ACE-catalyzed hydrolysis, with the single-chloride-ion and the double-chloride-ion forms existing simultaneously.

While the detection of polar drugs in plasma and urine is difficult using liquid-liquid or solid-phase extraction as these substances are poorly extracted, the 'dilute-and-shoot' approach is plausible. This paper describes a 'dilute-and-shoot' UHPLC-HRMS screening method to detect 46 polar drugs in equine urine and plasma, including some angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, sympathomimetics, anti-epileptics, hemostatics, the new doping agent 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-\u03b2-d-ribofuranoside (AICAR), as well as two threshold substances, namely dimethyl sulfoxide and theobromine. For plasma, the sample (200\u03bcL) was protein precipitated using trichloroacetic acid, and the resulting supernatant was diluted using Buffer A with an overall dilution factor of 3. For urine, the sample (20\u03bcL) was simply diluted 50-fold with Buffer A. The diluted plasma or urine sample was then analysed using a UHPLC-HRMS system in full-scan ESI mode. The assay was validated for qualitative identification purpose. This straightforward and reliable approach carried out in combination with other screening procedures has increased the efficiency of doping control analysis in the laboratory. Moreover, since the UHPLC-HRMS data were acquired in full-scan mode, the method could theoretically accommodate an unlimited number of existing and new doping agents, and would allow a retrospectively search for drugs that have not been targeted at the time of analysis.",

During anesthesia induction with propofol she suffered bradycardia, which was reversed with atropine, followed by tachyarrhythmia, reversed with lidocaine and precordial thump. Within hours she developed pulmonary edema and global respiratory failure due to acute left ventricular dysfunction. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed a dilated left ventricle with global hypokinesia and depressed left ventricular systolic function (ejection fraction <30%). The electrocardiogram showed persistent sinus tachycardia and nonspecific ST-T wave abnormalities. Cardiac biomarkers were elevated (troponin 2.42 ng/ml, proBNP 8248 pg/ml).

Two-kidney, one clip hypertensive rats were treated with quinapril (3.0 mg/kg for 10 days), and then received propofol infusion (15 mg/kg/h) during ongoing arterial thrombosis. The hemodynamic and hemostatic parameters were assayed. Quinapril exerted a hypotensive effect increasing after propofol infusion. Quinapril showed an antithrombotic effect with the platelet adhesion reduction, fibrinolysis enhancement and oxidative stress reduction. Propofol did not influence thrombosis; however, it inhibited fibrinolysis and showed prooxidative action. The effect of propofol on fibrinolysis and oxidative stress was significantly lower in quinapril-pretreated rats. Mortality was increased among rats treated with both drugs together. Our study demonstrates that pretreatment with quinapril reduced the adverse effects of propofol on hemostasis. Unfortunately, co-administration of both drugs potentiated hypotension in rats, which corresponds to higher mortality.",

    "121": "Anaphylaxis is an acute, life-threatening, multisystem syndrome resulting from the sudden release of mediators derived from mast cells and basophils. Food allergens are the main triggers of anaphylaxis, accounting for 33%-56% of all cases and up to 81% of cases of anaphylaxis in children. Human anaphylaxis is generally thought to be mediated by IgE, with mast cells and basophils as key players, although alternative mechanisms have been proposed. Neutrophils and macrophages have also been implicated in anaphylactic reactions, as have IgG-dependent, complement, and contact system activation. Not all allergic reactions are anaphylactic, and the presence of the so-called accompanying factors (cofactors or augmenting factors) may explain why some conditions lead to anaphylaxis, while in other cases the allergen elicits a milder reaction or is even tolerated. In the presence of these factors, allergic reactions may be induced at lower doses of allergen or become more severe. Cofactors are reported to be relevant in up to 30% of anaphylactic episodes. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and exercise are the best-documented cofactors, although estrogens, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, \u03b2-blockers, lipid-lowering drugs, and alcohol have also been involved. The mechanisms underlying anaphylaxis are complex and involve several interrelated pathways. Some of these pathways may be key to the development of anaphylaxis, while others may only modulate the severity of the reaction. An understanding of predisposing and augmenting factors could lead to the development of new prophylactic and therapeutic approaches.",

To elucidate the mechanisms by which these enzymes recognize and hydrolyze carbapenems, we solved 1.4 to 1.6 \u00c5 crystal structures of SMB-1 (Serratia metallo-\u03b2-lactamase 1), a subclass B3 MBL, bound to hydrolyzed carbapenems (doripenem, meropenem, and imipenem). In these structures, SMB-1 interacts mainly with the carbapenem core structure via elements in the active site, including a zinc ion (Zn-2), Q157[113] (where the position in the SMB-1 sequence is in brackets after the BBL number), S221[175], and T223[177]. There is less contact with the carbapenem R2 side chains, strongly indicating that SMB-1 primarily recognizes the carbapenem core structure. This is the first report describing how a subclass B3 MBL recognizes carbapenems. We also solved the crystal structure of SMB-1 in complex with the approved drugs captopril, an inhibitor of the angiotensin-converting enzyme, and 2-mercaptoethanesulfonate, a chemoprotectant. These drugs are inhibitors of SMB-1 with Ki values of 8.9 and 184 \u03bcM, respectively. Like carbapenems, these inhibitors interact with Q157[113] and T223[177] and their thiol groups coordinate the zinc ions in the active site. Taken together, the data indicate that Q157[113], S221[175], T223[177], and the two zinc ions in the active site are key targets in the design of SMB-1 inhibitors with enhanced affinity. The structural data provide a solid foundation for the development of effective inhibitors that would overcome the carbapenem resistance of MBL-producing multidrug-resistant microbes.",

A total of 17187 patients treated with six types of two-drug combinations and 9724 treated with six types of three-drug combinations from the Spanish ABPM Registry were analyzed. We compared achieved office and ambulatory BP, as well as office (< 140/90 mmHg) and ambulatory (24-hour BP < 130/80; day BP < 135/85, and night BP < 120/70 mmHg) BP control among groups. The combination of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers with diuretics and the triple combination of RAS blockers with diuretics and calcium channel blockers (CCB) were associated with lower values of 24-hour, daytime and nighttime BP, as well as more pronounced nocturnal BP dip. Compared with such combinations (reference), other double combinations had lower rates of ambulatory BP control. Moreover, triple combinations containing alpha blockers also had lower rates of ambulatory BP control. We conclude that even with similar office BP control, differences exist among antihypertensive two-drug and three-drug combinations with respect to ambulatory BP control achieved during treatment, with RAS blockers/diuretics and RAS blockers/CCBs/diuretics obtaining better control rates. This can help physicians choose among drug combinations in order to obtain further ambulatory BP reductions.",

Recently, we developed a novel sulfur-containing angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor: 3-(3-thienyl)-l-alanyl-ornithyl-proline (TOP). Our previous studies indicated a superior nature of the molecule as an antihypertensive agent in spontaneously hypertensive rats (showing the involvement of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system) in comparison to captopril. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of TOP on NO pathway in l-NAME-induced hypertensive rats, and captopril was included as the standard treatment group. Treatment with both TOP (20 mg/kg) and captopril (40 mg/kg) prevented the development of hypertension in l-NAME model, but TOP showed better restoration of NO and normal levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme. In addition, in vitro vasorelaxation assay showed an improvement in endothelium-dependent vasodilation in both the cases. Further, the biochemical (malondialdehyde, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase) and the histopathological effects of TOP on rat liver tissues revealed a protective nature of TOP in comparison to captopril in the l-NAME model. In conclusion, TOP at 50% lesser dose than captopril was found to be better in the l-NAME model.",

Effects of fermented soybean milk administration by gavage on systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure was also evaluated in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) rats and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. Results showed that, CICC 20280 and CICC 23184 FSM showed high ACE inhibitory activity in vitro test and ACE inhibitory activity of CICC 23184 FSM was higher than CICC 20280 FSM. The bioactive substances of FSM were peptide and \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Their contents in CICC 20280 FSM and CICC 23184 FSM were 3.97\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.67\u00a0mg/ml (peptide), 1.71\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.36\u00a0mg/ml (GABA) and 5.17\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.22\u00a0mg/ml (peptide), 1.57\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.21\u00a0mg/ml (GABA), respectively. Moreover, CICC 20280 and CICC 23184 FSM administration by gavage could effectively lower the blood pressure of SHR to a normal level, while there was no effect on blood pressure of WKY rats. This result indicated that the bioactive substances could play an antihypertensive role when the blood pressure was not within the normal levels (high levels).", 
    "159": "New antithrombotic therapies have significantly improved the outcomes of patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), where the introduction of ticagrelor has provided the greatest mortality benefits. However, ticagrelor treatment has been associated with a potential increase in the serum uric acid (SUA) levels, which may influence endothelial dysfunction and prothrombotic status, thereby affecting the risk of acute cardiovascular events in patients requiring dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). The present study aimed to compare the impact of antiplatelet agents such as ticagrelor or clopidogrel on SUA levels and their effect on platelet reactivity.", 
    "160": "We included patients admitted for ACS or elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and discharged with ASA (acetylsalicylic acid; 100-160\u00a0mg) and clopidogrel (75\u00a0mg) or ticagrelor (90\u00a0mg twice a day). Chemistry was assessed at admission (baseline) and after a 30-90-day period of DAPT (together with platelet reactivity). The absolute and percentage variations of SUA after DAPT introduction were considered. Multiple-electrode aggregometry was used to assess platelet function. A total of 378 patients were enrolled, with 145 treated with aspirin and clopidogrel (AC) and 233 with aspirin and ticagrelor (AT). The AC patients were older (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003) and more often showed elective PCI as an indication to DAPT (<0.001); they received chronic therapy with ARB (angiotensin II receptor blocker; p\u00a0=\u00a00.001), nitrates (p\u00a0=\u00a00.044), CCB (calcium channel blocker; p\u00a0=\u00a00.005) and diuretics (p\u00a0=\u00a00.044). The AT patients displayed a higher percentage of ACS diagnosis (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and received chronic therapy with ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001), beta blockers (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) and statins (p\u00a0=\u00a00.013). The AC patients displayed higher platelet reactivity at COL (collagen) test, ASPI test and ADP (adenosine diphosphate) test (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03, 0.001 and <0.001, respectively) and a higher percentage of HRPR (high residual platelet reactivity) in the ADP test (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). No difference was found in the baseline uric acid and creatinine levels between AC and AT patients. At 30-90 days, a significant absolute and percentage increase in the SUA levels was found in AT as compared to AC patients (0.204\u00a0mg/dl vs. -0.165\u00a0mg/dl, p\u00a0=\u00a00.034; 6.26% vs. -0.005%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.018, respectively). Results were not influenced by variations in renal function. At multivariate analysis, in fact, ticagrelor therapy emerged as an independent predictor of increase in the uric acid levels (odds ratio (OR; 95% confidence interval (CI))\u00a0=\u00a02.79 (1.66-4.67), p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

A bacterial-derived protease (HT) extensively hydrolysed both meat protein extracts, producing peptide hydrolysates with significant in vitro antioxidant and ACE inhibitor activities. The hydrolysates retained bioactivity after simulated gastrointestinal hydrolysis challenge. Gel permeation chromatography sub-fractionation of the crude protein hydrolysates showed that the smaller peptide fractions exhibited the highest antioxidant and ACE inhibitor activities. OFFGEL electrophoresis of the small peptides of both hydrolysates showed that low isoelectric point peptides had antioxidant activity; however, no consistent relationship was observed between isoelectric point and ACE inhibition. Cell-based assays indicated that the hydrolysates present no significant cytotoxicity towards Vero cells. The results indicate that HT protease hydrolysis of meat myofibrillar and connective tissue protein extracts produces bioactive peptides that are non-cytotoxic, should be stable in the gastrointestinal tract and may contain novel bioactive peptide sequences.", 
    "163": "Renal dysfunction and heart failure commonly co-exist; it is termed the cardiorenal syndrome (CRS). This combination of renal and cardiac impairment presents a substantial clinical challenge and is associated with adverse prognosis. The pathogenesis of the CRS is complex, including chronic activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and the sympathetic nervous system, together with reduced renal perfusion. Chronic activation of the RAAS can impair mitochondrial function, and increase mitochondrial derived oxidative stress which in turn can lead to renal injury and sodium and water retention. For example, it has been shown that exogenous Ang II augments renal mitochondrial oxidative stress, reduces GFR and induces albuminuria in rats with heart failure. Administration of Ang II also augmented renal mitochondrial dysfunction in aged mice. Current treatments for CRS, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, exert limited renal protection if any at all. Therefore, novel treatments particularly those that can target renal mechanisms downstream to chronic activation of the renal renin-angiotensin system are likely to exert renoprotection in the setting of CRS.",

    "165": "We have reviewed the effects of angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists (ARBs) in various animal models of hypertension, atherosclerosis, cardiac function, hypertrophy and fibrosis, glucose and lipid metabolism, and renal function and morphology. Those of azilsartan and telmisartan have been included comprehensively whereas those of other ARBs have been included systematically but without intention of completeness. ARBs as a class lower blood pressure in established hypertension and prevent hypertension development in all applicable animal models except those with a markedly suppressed renin-angiotensin system; blood pressure lowering even persists for a considerable time after discontinuation of treatment. This translates into a reduced mortality, particularly in models exhibiting marked hypertension. The retrieved data on vascular, cardiac and renal function and morphology as well as on glucose and lipid metabolism are discussed to address three main questions: 1. Can ARB effects on blood vessels, heart, kidney and metabolic function be explained by blood pressure lowering alone or are they additionally directly related to blockade of the renin-angiotensin system? 2. Are they shared by other inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system, e.g. angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors? 3. Are some effects specific for one or more compounds within the ARB class? Taken together these data profile ARBs as a drug class with unique properties that have beneficial effects far beyond those on blood pressure reduction and, in some cases distinct from those of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. The clinical relevance of angiotensin receptor-independent effects of some ARBs remains to be determined.", 
    "166": "Angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)], a counter-regulatory peptide of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) exerts its effects through the G-protein-coupled receptor Mas, which is expressed in different tissues, including the brain. Ang-(1-7) has a broad range of effects beyond the well-described cardiovascular and renal actions, including the modulation of emotional and behavioural responses. In the present study we tested the hypothesis that Ang-(1-7) could attenuate the anxiety- and depression-like behaviours observed in transgenic hypertensive (mRen2)27 rats (TGRs). We also hypothesized that Ang-(1-7) could be involved in the anxiolytic-like effect induced by ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) treatment in these hypertensive rats. Therefore, TGRs and Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to the Elevated Plus Maze (EPM) test, Forced Swimming Test (FST) and Novelty Suppressed Feeding (NSF). TGRs presented a decreased percentage of entries in the open arms of the EPM test, a phenotype reversed by systemic treatment with enalapril or intracerebroventricular infusion of Ang-(1-7). It is interesting that pre-treatment with A779, a selective Mas receptor antagonist, prevented the anxiolytic-like effect induced by the ACE inhibitor. In the NSF test, TGRs showed increased latency to eating, an indicative of a higher aversion in response to a new environment. These animals also showed increased immobility in the FST. Again, Ang-(1-7) reversed this phenotype. Thus, our data showed that Ang-(1-7) can modulate anxiety- and depression-like behaviours in TGRs and warrant further investigation as a new therapy for certain psychiatric disorders.",

    "170": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a central role in the control of blood pressure in the body and the way this interacts with other systems is widely recognized. This has not always been the case and this review summarizes how our knowledge has evolved from the initial discovery of renin by Tigerstedt and Berman in 1898. This includes the identification of angiotensin in the 1950s to the proposed relationship between this system, hypertension and ultimately cardiovascular disease. While the RAS is far more complex than originally thought, much is now known about this system and the wide ranging effects of angiotensin in the body. This has enabled the development of therapies that target the various proteins in this pathway and hence are implicated in disease. The first of these treatments was the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is), followed by the angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and more recently the direct renin inhibitors (DRIs). Clinical outcome trials have shown these drugs to be effective, but as they act at contrasting points in the RAS, there are differences in their efficacy and safety profiles. RAS blockade is the foundation of modern combination therapy with a calcium channel blocker and/or a diuretic given to reduce blood pressure and limit the impact of RAS activation. Other options that complement these treatments may be available in the future and will offer more choice to clinicians.",

Lowering of blood pressure has been shown to minimize the risk of cardiovascular events, with the majority of antihypertensives demonstrating a similar ability to reduce coronary events and stroke for a given reduction in blood pressure. Agents that modify the activity of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) have been proposed to exhibit additional effects that might go beyond simple blood pressure lowering. The RAS is a crucial system that regulates extracellular fluid volume and blood pressure. Proposed potential benefits of RAS blockade that go beyond blood pressure lowering include a reduction in platelet aggregation and thrombosis, blunting of cardiac and vascular remodeling, favorable metabolic effects and reno- and cerebro-protection. However, factors such as treatment adherence, duration of action of antihypertensive agents and differences in effects on central versus brachial blood pressure may also result in apparent differences in efficacy of different antihypertensives. The aim of this review article is to examine the available data from clinical studies of antihypertensive drugs for evidence of effects that might legitimately be claimed to go beyond simple blood pressure lowering.",

The objective of our study was to assess the association between rs2106809 polymorphism in ACE2 gene and the blood pressure response to ACE inhibitors in untreated hypertensive patients. After a 2-week, double-blind placebo run-in period, either benazepril or imidapril was administered for 6 weeks to 497 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. The achieved changes in BP were analyzed for their association with genotypes at ACE2 gene loci. In female hypertensive patients, the genotype frequency of ACE2 rs2106809 was 36.7%, 45.2% and 18.1% for CC, CT and TT genotypes, respectively. After 6 weeks of treatment, the reductions in diastolic blood pressure were significantly greater in female patients carrying the CC or CT genotype compared with those carrying the TT genotype (9.62\u00b16.83 or 10.2\u00b17.2 versus 6.81\u00b16.31\u2009mm\u2009Hg, respectively; P=0.045, analysis of variance (ANOVA)).

In male hypertensive patients, the genotype frequency of ACE2 rs2106809 was 58.1% and 41.9% for C and T genotypes, respectively. However, no association could be observed in males. We conclude that ACE2 rs2106809 is an important predictive factor of the response to antihypertensive treatment with ACE inhibitors in Chinese female hypertensive patients.", 
    "179": "Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are an important class of antihypertensives whose action on the human organism is still not fully understood. Although it is known that ACE especially cleaves COOH-terminal dipeptides from active polypeptides, the whole range of substrates and products is still unknown. When analyzing the action of ACE inhibitors, effects of genetic variation on metabolism need to be considered since genetic variance in the ACE gene locus was found to be associated with ACE-concentration in blood as well as with changes in the metabolic profiles of a general population. To investigate the interactions between genetic variance at the ACE-locus and the influence of ACE-therapy on the metabolic status we analyzed 517 metabolites in 1,361 participants from the KORA F4 study. We replicated our results in 1,964 individuals from TwinsUK. We observed differences in the concentration of five dipeptides and three ratios of di- and oligopeptides between ACE inhibitor users and non-users that were genotype dependent. Such changes in the concentration affected major homozygotes, and to a lesser extent heterozygotes, while minor homozygotes showed no or only small changes in the metabolite status. Two of these resulting dipeptides, namely aspartylphenylalanine and phenylalanylserine, showed significant associations with blood pressure which qualifies them-and perhaps also the other dipeptides-as readouts of ACE-activity. Since so far ACE activity measurement is substrate specific due to the usage of only one oligopeptide, taking several dipeptides as potential products of ACE into account may provide a broader picture of the ACE activity.", 
    "180": "Heart failure in the setting of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an increasingly common scenario and carries a poor prognosis. Clinicians lack tools for primary or secondary heart failure prevention in patients with cardiorenal syndromes. In patients without CKD, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) and statins mitigate cardiovascular risk in large part due to salutary effects on the endothelium. In the setting of CKD, use of these therapies is limited by adverse effects of hyperkalemia in pre-dialysis CKD (ACE-I/ARB), or potential increased risk of stroke in end-stage renal disease (statins). The soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulators are a novel class of medications that promote endothelial and myocardial function with no known risk of hyperkalemia or stroke. In this review, we discuss the evidence emerging from recent clinical trials of sGC stimulators in pulmonary hypertension and heart failure, the diseased pathways involved in cardiorenal syndromes likely to be restored by sGC stimulators, and several strategies for designing future clinical trials of cardiorenal syndromes that might shorten the timeline for discovery and approval of effective cardiovascular therapies in these high-risk patients.",

To clarify whether serotonergic mechanisms in the SFO participate in the modulatory system, the present study was carried out to examine the effects of sodium and water intake on serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) release in the subfornical organ (SFO) in freely moving rats. The ingestion of 0.3M NaCl and water was induced by subcutaneous injections of the diuretic furosemide (FURO, 10mg/kg) and the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (CAP, 5mg/kg), and extracellular concentrations of 5-HT and its metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in the region of the SFO were measured using intracerebral microdialysis techniques. The combined treatment with FURO and CAP elicited significant decreases in the 5-HT and 5-HIAA levels in the SFO area. The 0.3M NaCl and water intake caused by the treatment significantly enhanced the 5-HT and 5-HIAA concentrations in the SFO area compared with the basal levels. No significant changes in the 5-HT and 5-HIAA levels caused by either the FURO and CAP treatment or water and NaCl intake were observed in the sites away from the SFO. These results suggest that the serotonergic mechanism in the SFO may be important for the control of sodium appetite and thirst.",

Convincing data have also recently been published indicating that the clinical heterogeneity of hereditary angioedema due to C1 inhibitor deficiency (classified as C1-INH-HAE) could be attributed at least in part, either to the type of SERPING1 mutations or to mutations in genes encoding for enzymes involved in the metabolism and function of bradykinin.

Such strategies have not been regularly reported in descriptions of interventions' effectiveness, or in assessments of how proven interventions are implemented in new settings. This lack of reporting may hinder efforts to successfully translate effective interventions into \"real-world\" practice. A recently published framework was designed to standardize reporting on implementation strategies in the implementation science literature. We applied this framework to describe the strategies used to implement a single intervention in its original commercial care setting, and when implemented in community health centers from September 2010 through May 2015. Per this framework, the target (clinic staff) and outcome (prescribing rates) remained the same across settings; the actor, action, temporality, and dose were adapted to fit local context. The framework proved helpful in articulating which of the implementation strategies were kept constant and which were tailored to fit diverse settings, and simplified our reporting of their effects. Researchers should consider consistently reporting this information, which could be crucial to the success or failure of implementing proven interventions effectively across diverse care settings.",

    "212": "Atherosclerosis and hypertension can potentially progess into dangerous cardiovascular diseases such as myocardial infarction and stroke. Statins are widely used to lower cholesterol levels while antihypertensive agents such as captopril are widely prescribed to treat high blood pressure. Curcumin, a phenolic compound isolated from Curcuma domestica, has been proven effective for a broad spectrum of diseases, including hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. Therefore, curcumin is quite promising as an alternative therapeutic compound. Our previous studies have proven a significant increase in physical properties, bioavailability, and stability of curcumin when encapsulated in a nanoemulsion. The purpose of this study was to assess the ability of the nanoemulsion in enhancing curcumin activity as a antihypertensive and antihypercholesterolemic agent. The formulation and preparation method of the curcumin nanoemulsion have been developed in our previous study. Physical characterization was performed, including measurement of droplet size, polidispersity index, zeta potential, entrapment efficiency, and loading capacity. Antihypertensive activity of curcumin was evaluated by determining Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibition in vitro. A substrate for ACE, hippuryl-L-histidyl-L-leucine was allowed to react with ACE, resulting in hippuric acid formation as the product. The degree of ACE inhibition by curcumin was represented by the amount of hippuric acid formed. Antihypercholesterolemic activity of curcumin was studied using the HMG-CoA reductase assay equipped with a 96-well UV plate. This assay was based on the spectrophotometric measurement of the decrease in absorbance which represents the oxidation of NADPH by the catalytic subunit of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR) in the presence of the substrate HMG-CoA. Curcumin is known to have no significant difference in inhibiting ACE compared to Captopril, but when it was incorporated in the self-nanoemulsifying carrier, it slightly increased the inhibitory effect on ACE. In contrast, the effect of curcumin in reducing cholesterol based on the HMGR assay was more pronounced. Curcumin encapsulated in a nanoemulsion showed significant cholesterol-lowering activity compared to a standard drug, pravastatin. Therefore, we conclude that curcumin does not show ACE inhibitory effects, but has potential use as an alternative therapeutic compound to treat hyperlipidaemia. Curcumin encapsulated in a nanoemulsion increased not only the HMGR inhibition, but also ACE inhibition of curcumin. These effects are suggested to be the result of improved solubility in the nanoemulsion system.", 
    "213": "In European countries and in the USA, hypertension represents an important risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in men and women. Women do not perceive CVD as an important health problem, despite the evidence that women are more at risk to die from hypertension-related CVD than men. A correct prevention strategy should more widely acknowledge sex-specific risk factors, such as hypertension in pregnancy, and the benefit of treating hypertension in both men and women. In more recent years, hypertension awareness and treatment rates are higher in women than in men while blood pressure control rates are improving, but remain still lower in older hypertensive women. Differences have been described regarding the pattern of antihypertensive drug prescription and use in hypertensive men and women; women are more frequently treated with diuretics and less frequently with angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors and angiotensin-receptors blockers. Calcium-antagonists appear to be particularly effective in women. Data from large clinical trials and meta-analyses offer strong evidence that the efficacy of the various drug classes in prevention of CV events does not differ by sex, and therefore the choice of the drug cannot be based only on this criterion in post- menopausal women. There are currently no specific blood pressure (BP) treatment goals for post-menopausal hypertension.", 
    "214": "Risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes are known to augment the activity and tissue expression of angiotensin II (Ang II), the major effector peptide of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Overstimulation of the RAS has been implicated in a chain of events that contribute to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular (CV) disease, including the development of cardiac remodelling. This chain of events has been termed the CV continuum. The concept of CV disease existing as a continuum was first proposed in 1991 and it is believed that intervention at any point within the continuum can modify disease progression. Treatment with antihypertensive agents may result in regression of left ventricular hypertrophy, with different drug classes exhibiting different degrees of efficacy. The greatest decrease in left ventricular mass is observed following treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is), which inhibit Ang II formation. Although ACE-Is and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) provide significant benefits in terms of CV events and stroke, mortality remains high. This is partly due to a failure to completely suppress the RAS, and, as our knowledge has increased, an escape phenomenon has been proposed whereby the human sequence of the 12 amino acid substrate angiotensin-(1-12) is converted to Ang II by the mast cell protease, chymase. Angiotensin-(1-12) is abundant in a wide range of organs and has been shown to increase blood pressure in animal models, an effect abolished by the presence of ACE-Is or ARBs. This review explores the CV continuum, in addition to examining the influence of the RAS. We also consider novel pathways within the RAS and how new therapeutic approaches that target this are required to further reduce Ang II formation, and so provide patients with additional benefits from a more complete blockade of the RAS.",

This is a complex process and the majority of treatments target the consequences of this, rather than the pathophysiology of ageing itself. This is because preventing vascular ageing from occurring is complex and would require very early intervention and lifelong treatment. The process of arteriosclerosis is known to result from reversible and irreversible functional components, and, together, these are responsible for the increased systolic and decreased diastolic blood pressure seen with advancing age. Indeed, hypertension develops as it becomes more difficult for the heart to drive blood flow around the body, as a result of poor ventricular coupling and increased arterial stiffness. Elevated blood pressure is therefore a clinical manifestation of ageing that continues to increase with advancing years, and is also linked with an increased risk of cardiac, cerebrovascular and chronic kidney disease. These manifestations arise due to changing haemodynamics associated with ageing, and therefore treatments that reduce the development of these conditions or delay their progression have the potential to improve patient outcomes. This may be possible with existing therapies as well as new treatments currently under investigation.",

    "248": "Angiotensin (Ang) II plays a critical role in cardiovascular and blood pressure regulation. Ang II is produced by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and it interacts with the Ang AT1 receptor to cause much of its well-known cardiovascular effects. Ang-(1-7) is another active peptide produced by the rennin-angiotensin system. This peptide is produced from Ang I or Ang II by the catalytic activity of ACE2. Ang-(1-7) interacts with the Mas receptor to counteract many of the effects of Ang II. Thus, the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis acts opposite of the ACE/Ang II/AT1 axis. In this study we investigated how Ang II regulates the key enzymes of these axes, ACE and its homolog ACE2, and determined whether they are dysregulated in the hypertensive condition. Brainstem and cerebellum astrocytes isolated from the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) were used in these studies. Ang II effect on the enzymes' mRNA and protein levels was measured using quantitative PCR and western blotting techniques, respectively. Results from this study showed that Ang II up-regulated ACE protein levels, but down-regulated ACE mRNA levels in brainstem and cerebellum astrocytes in both models. Ang II also reduced ACE2 mRNA expression in SHR and Wistar astrocytes isolated from both brain regions. Ang II effects on ACE2 protein were biphasic. In SHR astrocytes, Ang II-mediated ACE2 protein initially increased then decreased at later time points. In contrast, in Wistar astrocytes, Ang II initially decreased ACE2 protein expression, but up-regulated the protein at later time points. The findings of these studies suggest that Ang II has a differential effect on ACE and ACE2 expression. Furthermore, in the SHR model there may be alteration in the ACE/ACE2 balance in a manner that favors increased Ang II generation and decreased Ang-(1-7) production contributing to the hypertensive phenotype observed in this model. The levels of angiotensin (Ang) II depend on the actions of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and ACE2. We showed in astrocytes isolated from the SHRs that Ang II differentially affects ACE and ACE2 expression. There may be an alteration in the ACE/ACE2 balance favoring Ang II generation. This imbalance may contribute to the hypertensive phenotype observed in\u00a0this SHR model.", 
    "249": "Because adult podocytes cannot proliferate and are therefore unable to self-renew, replacement of these cells depends on stem/progenitor cells. Although podocyte number is higher after renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibition in glomerular diseases, the events explaining this increase are unclear. Cells of renin lineage (CoRL) have marked plasticity, including the ability to acquire a podocyte phenotype. To test the hypothesis that RAAS inhibition partially replenishes adult podocytes by increasing CoRL number, migration, and/or transdifferentiation, we administered tamoxifen to Ren1cCreERxRs-tdTomato-R CoRL reporter mice to induce permanent labeling of CoRL with red fluorescent protein variant tdTomato. We then induced experimental FSGS, typified by abrupt podocyte depletion, with a cytopathic antipodocyte antibody. RAAS inhibition by enalapril (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) or losartan (angiotensin-receptor blocker) in FSGS mice stimulated the proliferation of CoRL, increasing the reservoir of these cells in the juxtaglomerular compartment (JGC). Compared with water or hydralazine, RAAS inhibition significantly increased the migration of CoRL from the JGC to the intraglomerular compartment (IGC), with more glomeruli containing RFP(+)CoRL and, within these glomeruli, more RFP(+)CoRL. Moreover, RAAS inhibition in FSGS mice increased RFP(+)CoRL transdifferentiation in the IGC to phenotypes, consistent with those of podocytes (coexpression of synaptopodin and Wilms tumor protein), parietal epithelial cells (PAX 8), and mesangial cells (\u03b18 integrin). These results show that in the context of podocyte depletion in FSGS, RAAS inhibition augments CoRL proliferation and plasticity toward three different glomerular cell lineages.",

Community-acquired AKI and the use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs in the emergency department were retrospectively assessed in 324 patients with baseline stage 3 or higher CKD. After stepwise regression analysis, the use of ACE inhibitors (odds ratio [OR], 1.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-3.1; P=.02) and the presence of dehydration (OR, 30.8; 95% CI, 3.9-239.1) were associated with AKI. A total of 45% of patients using ACE inhibitors experienced overdosing, which causes most of the excess risk of AKI. These results suggest that dosage adjustment of ACE inhibitors to renal function or substitution of ACE inhibitors with ARBs could reduce the incidence of AKI. Moreover, ACE inhibitors and ARBs should be stopped in cases of dehydration.",

Inducible NPHS2-rtTA/tetO-Cre/RS-ZsGreen-R reporter mice were generated to permanently label podocytes with the ZsGreen reporter. Experimental focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) was induced with a cytotoxic podocyte antibody. On FSGS day 7, immunostaining for the podocyte markers p57, synaptopodin, and podocin were markedly decreased by 44%, and this was accompanied by a decrease in ZsGreen fluorescence. The nuclear stain DAPI was absent in segments of reduced ZsGreen and podocyte marker staining, which is consistent with podocyte depletion. Staining for p57, synaptopodin, podocin, and DAPI increased at FSGS day 28 and was augmented by the ACE inhibitor enalapril, which is consistent with a partial replenishment of podocytes. In contrast, ZsGreen fluorescence did not return and remained significantly low at day 28, indicating replenishment was from a nonpodocyte origin. Despite administration of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) thrice weekly throughout the course of disease, BrdU staining was not detected in podocytes, which is consistent with an absence of proliferation. Although ZsGreen reporting was reduced in the tuft at FSGS day 28, labeled podocytes were detected along the Bowman's capsule in a subset of glomeruli, which is consistent with migration from the tuft. Moreover, more than half of the migrated podocytes coexpressed the parietal epithelial cell (PEC) proteins claudin-1, SSeCKS, and PAX8. These results show that although podocytes can be partially replenished following abrupt depletion, a process augmented by ACE inhibition, the source or sources are nonpodocyte in origin and are independent of proliferation. Furthermore, a subset of podocytes migrate to the Bowman's capsule and begin to coexpress PEC markers.",

One hypothesis is that resistant hypertension is due to abnormal sodium retention, mediated by aldosterone breakthrough occurring despite blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB). Thus, there has been renewed interest in the use of mineralocorticoid receptor blockers (MRB) to treat this condition. This article critically evaluates new evidence supporting the use of MRB in TRH published in the last 3\u00a0years.

While it is important to avoid nephrotoxic agents in this setting, clinicians should appreciate that inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers are likely to preserve glomerular filtration rate and prolong the time until patients on PD reach anuria, and this may improve mortality in these patients.

While clinically relevant NOS3 polymorphisms were previously shown to affect the antihypertensive responses to enalapril, no study has tested the hypothesis that NOS3 tagSNPs influence the antihypertensive effects of this drug. We examined whether the NOS3 tagSNPs rs3918226, rs3918188, and rs743506, and their haplotypes, affect the antihypertensive responses to enalapril in 101 patients with essential hypertension. Subjects were prospectively treated only with enalapril for 8 weeks. Genotypes were determined by Taqman(\u00ae) allele discrimination assay and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and haplotype frequencies were estimated. We compared the effects of NOS3 tagSNPs on changes in blood pressure after enalapril treatment. To confirm our findings, multiple linear regression analysis was performed adjusting for age, gender, ethnicity, and alcohol consumption. We found that hypertensive patients carrying the AA genotype for the tagSNP rs3918188 showed lower decreases in blood pressure in response to enalapril. Moreover, the TCA haplotype was associated with improved decreases in blood pressure in response to enalapril compared with the CAG haplotype. Adjustment for covariates in multiple linear regression analysis did not change these effects. In addition, when patients were stratified according to the dose of enalapril used, we found that the carries of the T allele for the functional tagSNP rs3918226 showed more intense decreases in blood pressure in response to enalapril 20\u00a0mg/day.

    "293": "The development and progression of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and renal disorders are very closely related. In patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), therapies proven to protect the cardiovascular and renal systems simultaneously are generally used only at low doses or not at all. In particular, patients with CKD who receive angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, or mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonists (MRAs) often do not experience complete blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, primarily owing to the risk of hyperkalaemia. In this Review, we provide an overview of the available treatments required for adequate cardiorenal protection in patients with CKD. Drugs such as \u03b2-blockers that interfere with renin secretion will be discussed, in addition to agents that can prevent hyperkalaemia, such as potassium binders and nonsteroidal MRAs. Furthermore, the current literature on the role of statins, in addition to new compounds and dosing recommendations for the treatment of patients with CKD will also be reviewed. Further studies with these new compounds and doses are needed to ascertain whether these approaches can improve the long-term cardiovascular and renal prognosis in patients with CKD.",

Major and minor bleeding, access site bleeding and rates of prescription of cardiovascular medication at discharge were determined based on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Renal insufficiency was an independent predictor of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Bleeding events and access site bleeding requiring transfusion were significantly associated with degrees of renal insufficiency (p<0.001). There was an incremental decline in prescription of cardiovascular medication at discharge proportionate to the degree of renal impairment (aspirin, thienopyridine, statin, coumadin (overall p<0.001), beta blocker (overall p=0.003), ACE inhibitor (overall p=0.02). Bleeders were less likely to be discharged on a thienopyridine (95.4% versus 89.9% for bleeding, p<0.001 and 95.3% versus 87.9% for access site bleeding, p=0.005), but not aspirin (96.3% versus 96.2%, p=0.97 and 96.3% versus 93.6%, p=0.29 respectively).

    "297": "Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. A crude water extract of the fruiting bodies of a highly prized mushroom Tricholoma matsutakei exerted an antihypertensive action on spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) at a dosage of 400 mg/kg. An angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptide with an IC50 of 0.40 \u03bcM was purified from the extract and designated as TMP. Its amino acid sequence was elucidated to be WALKGYK through LC-MS/MS analysis. The Lineweaver-Burk plot suggested that TMP was a non-competitive inhibitor of ACE. A short-term assay of antihypertensive activity demonstrated that TMP at the dosage of 25 mg/kg could significantly lower the systolic blood pressure (SBP) of SHRs. TMP exhibited remarkable stability over a wide range of temperatures and pH values. It also demonstrated 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity. The aforementioned activities of TMP were corroborated by utilizing the synthetic peptide. Hence T. matsutake can be used as a functional food to help prevent hypertension- associated diseases.",

    "305": "This review and update focuses on the clinical features of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), the thiazide-like agents chlorthalidone (CTDN) and indapamide (INDAP), potassium-sparing ENaC inhibitors and aldosterone receptor antagonists, and loop diuretics. Diuretics are the second most commonly prescribed class of antihypertensive medication, and thiazide-related diuretics have increased at a rate greater than that of antihypertensive medications as a whole. The latest hypertension guidelines have underscored the importance of diuretics for all patients, but particularly for those with salt-sensitive and resistant hypertension. HCTZ is 4.2-6.2 systolic mm Hg less potent than CTDN, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta blockers, and calcium channel blockers by 24-hour measurements and 5.1mm Hg systolic less potent than INDAP by office measurements. For reducing cardiovascular events (CVEs), HCTZ is less effective than enalapril and amlodipine in randomized trials, and, in network analysis of trials, it is less effective than CTDN and HCTZ-amiloride. Combined with thiazide-type diuretics, potassium-sparing agents decrease ventricular ectopy and reduce the risk for sudden cardiac death relative to thiazide-type diuretics used alone. A recent synthesis of 44 trials has shown that the relative potencies in milligrams among spironolactone (SPIR), amiloride, and eplerenone (EPLER) are approximately from 25 to 10 to 100, respectively, which may be important when SPIR is poorly tolerated. SPIR reduces proteinuria beyond that provided by other renin angiotensin aldosterone inhibitors. EPLER also reduces proteinuria and has beneficial effects on endothelial function. While guidelines often do not differentiate among specific diuretics, this review demonstrates that these distinctions are important for managing hypertension.", 
    "306": "This work was focused on the study of the bioactive potential of three fish protein hydrolysates, one of them prepared from industrial sardine by-products (head and viscera) and the others from tuna by-products (head, and muscle and viscera). These protein hydrolysates exhibited moderate ability to inhibit Angiotensin Converting Enzyme or ACE (IC50 between 0.24-1.16 mg dry weight per ml) and prolyl oligopeptidase or PO (IC50 between 3.30-9.57 mg ml(-1)), those obtained from tuna by-products being the most effective. Overall, ACE- and PO-inhibiting activities were enhanced by sequential nanofiltration through 3 and 1 kDa MWCO membranes (IC50 between 0.02-0.16 mg ml(-1) (ACE) and 1.10-4.21 mg ml(-1) (PO)). The inhibitory properties of the hydrolysates were greatly improved by in vitro gastric digestion, and were barely affected by further intestinal digestion. The digested tuna hydrolysates, mainly that from heads, proved to be the best source of PO- and ACE- inhibiting molecules (IC50 = 0.16 mg ml(-1) (ACE) and 1.04 mg ml(-1) (PO)) and could be potential new ingredients in food with interest in the prevention or treatment of cardiovascular and neurological diseases.", 
    "307": "Adverse cardiac remodeling after myocardial infarction (MI) leads to progressive heart failure. Obese-insulin resistance increases risks of MI and heart failure. Although dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitor is known to exert cardioprotection, its effects on adverse remodeling after MI in obese-insulin-resistant rats are unclear. We hypothesized that DPP4 inhibitor reduces adverse left ventricular (LV) remodeling and LV dysfunction in obese-insulin-resistant rats with MI. Rats were fed either normal diet (ND) or high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks to induce obese-insulin resistance, followed by left anterior descending coronary artery ligation to induce MI. Then, rats in each dietary group were divided into five subgroups to receive vehicle, enalapril (10mg/kg/day), metformin (30mg/kg/day), DPP4 inhibitor vildagliptin (3mg/kg/day), or combined metformin and vildagliptin for 8 weeks. Heart rate variability (HRV), LV function, pathological and biochemical studies for LV remodeling, and cardiomyocyte apoptosis were determined. Obese-insulin-resistant rats had severe insulin resistance and LV dysfunction. HFD rats had a higher mortality rate than ND rats, and all treatments reduced the mortality rate in obese-insulin-resistant rats. Although all drugs improved insulin resistance, HRV, LV function as well as reduced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, vildagliptin effectively reduced cardiomyocyte cross-sectional areas more than enalapril and was related to markedly decreased ERK1/2 phosphorylation. In ND rats with MI, metformin neither improved LV ejection fraction nor reduced cardiac fibrosis. The infarct size and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 expression were not different among groups. In obese-insulin-resistant rats with chronic MI, DPP4 inhibitor vildagliptin exerts better cardioprotection than enalapril in attenuating adverse LV remodeling.", 
    "308": "The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is a close, interactive partner to the photoreceptors as well as an interface with the endothelium of the choroid and thus with the body's circulatory system. To fulfill these roles, the RPE communicates with neighboring tissue by secretion of a large variety of factors and is able to react to secreted factors via a plethora of transmembrane receptors. Clinically relevant local pharmacological effects are caused by anti-VEGF-A treatment in choroidal neovascularization or by carboanhydrase inhibitors reducing fluid accumulation in the macula. Being exposed to the bloodstream, the RPE reacts to systemic disease, such as diabetes or hypertension, but also to systemic pharmacological intervention, for example to hypotensive drugs acting on the renin-angiotensin-system. Sustained pharmacological treatments, in particular, cause side effects at the RPE with consequences for both RPE function and photoreceptor survival. Among these are systemic inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme, insulin treatment in diabetes and anti-VEGF-A therapy. Given the special anatomical and functional relationships of the RPE, pharmacological intervention targeting either the eye or the body systemically should take potential alteration of RPE and subsequently photoreceptor function into account.",

Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is common and necessary for patients with CAD, but it has not completely evaluated in cases with repeated PCI. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the risk factors and prognosis in patients with CAD requiring repeated PCI. This is a prospective observational study. A total of 1126 patients with CAD requiring PCI took part in this study. Clinical parameters including baseline characteristics, hemodynamic data, location of vascular lesions, SYNTAX score, left ventricular ejection fraction, central pulse pressure (CPP), central aortic systolic pressure (CSP), risk factors, and invasive strategies were analyzed to identify the risk factors for patients requiring repeated PCI. We further analyzed the prognosis, including risk for myocardial infarction (MI), cardiovascular (CV) mortality, and all-cause mortality, in patients with repeated PCI. Among patients with PCI, 276 received repeated PCI. Patients in the repeated PCI group had a higher CPP (66.7 vs 62.5\u200amm Hg; P\u200a=\u200a0.006), CSP (139.9 vs 135.9\u200amm Hg; P\u200a=\u200a0.017), and male preponderance (P\u200a=\u200a0.012). Drugs including diuretics, beta-blockers (BBs), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), and aspirin were all used more frequently in the repeated PCI group (all P\u200a<\u200a0.05). Freedom from MI was lower in the repeated PCI group than in the single PCI group (P\u200a<\u200a0.001). Logistic regression revealed that CPP, CSP, number of diseased vessels, male sex, usage of diuretics, BBs, ACEIs, and MI were all predictors for requiring repeated PCI (all P\u200a<\u200a0.05). In addition, CPP was a predictor for MI attack, CV mortality, and all-cause mortality in the repeated PCI group (P\u200a=\u200a0.010, P\u200a=\u200a0.041, P\u200a=\u200a0.004, respectively). Elevated CPP, CSP, male sex, multiple diseased vessels, and the usage of diuretics, BBs, ACEIs, and MI were predictors for repeated PCI. Most importantly, CPP was strongly associated with MI attack, CV mortality, and all-cause mortality, and could serve as a prognostic parameter for mortality in patients with CAD after performing repeated PCI.",

    "318": "Pharmacological blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers is the current standard treatment to prevent progressive renal function loss in patients with chronic kidney disease. Yet in many patients the renal protective effect of RAAS-blockade is incomplete. Short-term clinical studies have demonstrated that dietary sodium restriction potentiates the antiproteinuric effect of RAAS-blockade. More recently, it was shown that this effect is accompanied by a lower risk of end-stage renal disease and adverse cardiovascular outcomes. The modulation of RAAS-blockade efficacy by sodium intake is likely multifactorial, and is mediated by effects of sodium on local tissue RAAS in kidney, vasculature and brain, and by effects on the immune system. Despite the evidence showing the beneficial effects of even a moderate sodium restriction (\u223c2.5g/d), it remains difficult to realize in clinical practice. In an analysis based on 24-h urinary sodium excretion data from more than 10,000 CKD patients and renal transplant recipients, we found that sodium intake in these patients is on average 3.8g/d, closely resembling the global general population (3.95g/d). Behavioral approaches including the use of online dietary coaching (ehealth) and feedback using data from 24-h urine collections may be useful to successfully lower dietary sodium intake, aiming to improve cardio-renal outcomes in patients with CKD.",

Amino acid profiles indicated a higher proportion of hydrophobic residues in OD-FPH and hydrophilic residues in FD-FPH samples. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra revealed random coil structure in OD-FPH and \u03b2-sheet in FD-FPH samples. The approximate molecular weight of peptides in OD-FPH and FD-FPH was in the range of 7030-339Da. The IC50 values for ACE inhibition by OD-FPH and FD-FPH samples were found to be 1.15 and 1.53mg of proteinml(-1), respectively. The ACE-inhibitory activity of OD-FPH was more stable (during sequential digestion, using pepsin and pancreatin) than that of FD-FPH sample.

The present study investigated the effects of losartan on the physicochemical and biomechanical properties of diabetic rat bone. Losartan (5\u00a0mg/kg/day) was administered via oral gavage for 12\u00a0weeks. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Whole femurs were tested under tension to evaluate the biomechanical properties of bone. The physicochemical properties of bone were analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Although losartan did not recover decreases in the BMD of diabetic bone, it recovered the physicochemical (mineral and collagen matrix) properties of diabetic rat bone. Furthermore, losartan also recovered ultimate tensile strength of diabetic rat femurs. Losartan, an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker, has a therapeutic effect on the physicochemical properties of diabetic bone resulting in improvement of bone strength at the material level. Therefore, specific inhibition of this pathway at the receptor level shows potential as a therapeutic target for diabetic patients suffering from bone diseases such as osteopenia.", 
    "325": "Dystroglycan (DG) is widely expressed in various tissues, and throughout the cerebral microvasculature. It consists of two subunits, \u03b1-DG and \u03b2-DG, and the cleavage of the latter by matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -9 underlies a number of physiological and pathological processes. However, the involvement of MMP-2/-9-mediated \u03b2-DG cleavage in cerebral ischemia remains uncertain. In astrocytes, DG is crucial for maintaining the polarization of aquaporin-4 (AQP4), which plays a role in the regulation of cytotoxic and vasogenic edema. The present study aimed to explore the effects of MMP-2/-9-mediated \u03b2-DG cleavage on AQP4 polarization and brain edema in acute cerebral ischemia. A model of cerebral ischemia was established via permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) in male C57BL/6 mice. Western blotting, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), immunohistochemical staining, immunofluorescent staining, electron microscopy, and light microscopy were used. Captopril was applied as a selective MMP-2/-9 inhibitor. Recombinant mouse MMP (rmMMP)-2 and -9 were used in an in vitro cleavage experiment. The present study demonstrated evidence of \u03b2-DG cleavage by MMP-2/-9 in pMCAO mouse brains; this cleavage was implicated in AQP4 redistribution and brain edema in cerebral ischemia. In addition, captopril exacerbated cytotoxic edema and ameliorated vasogenic edema at 24h after pMCAO, and alleviated brain edema and neurological deficit at 48h and 72h. In conclusion, this study provides novel insight into the effects of MMP-2/-9-mediated \u03b2-DG cleavage in acute cerebral ischemia. Such findings might facilitate the development of a therapeutic strategy for the optimization of MMP-2/-9 targeted treatment in cerebral ischemia.",

Current guideline-based therapies for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, including beta blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and aldosterone antagonists aim to interrupt deleterious neurohormonal pathways and have shown significant success in reducing morbidity and mortality associated with heart failure. Continued efforts to further improve outcomes in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction have led to the first new-in-class medications approved for heart failure since 2005, ivabradine and sacubitril/valsartan. Ivabradine targets the If channels in the sinoatrial node of the heart, decreasing heart rate. Sacubitril/valsartan combines a neprilysin inhibitor that increases levels of beneficial vasodilatory peptides with an angiotensin receptor antagonist. On a background of previously approved, guideline-directed medical therapies for heart failure, these medications have shown improved clinical outcomes ranging from decreased hospitalizations in a select group of patients to a reduction in all-cause mortality across all pre-specified subgroups. In this review, we will discuss the previously established guideline-directed medical therapies for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, the translational research that led to the development of these new therapies, and the results from the major clinical trials of ivabradine and sacubitril/valsartan.",

Other covariates in the model that were independently associated with CINA included advanced age, diabetes mellitus (DM), use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), history of dementia and living in a residential care facility.",

    "332": "This study investigated short-term (24 h) and long-term (5 wk) systolic blood pressure (SBP)-lowering effects in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) of a 5 kDa membrane pea protein hydrolysate permeate (PPH-5) produced through thermoase hydrolysis of pea protein isolate (PPI). Amino acid analysis showed that the PPH-5 had lower contents of sulfur-containing amino acids than the PPI. Size-exclusion chromatography indicated mainly low molecular weight (<10 kDa) peptides in PPH-5 but not in the PPI. The PPH-5 had renin and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition IC50 values of 0.57 and 0.10 mg/mL (P < 0.05), respectively, and consisted mainly of peptides with 2 to 6 amino acids. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed mainly hydrophilic tetrapeptide sequences. After a single oral administration (100 mg/kg body weight) to SHR, the unheated PPI showed weakest (P < 0.05) SBP-lowering effect with a -4 mm Hg maximum when compared to -25 mm Hg for heat-treated PPI and -36 mm Hg for PPH-5. Incorporation of the PPH-5 as 0.5% or 1% (w/w) casein substitute in the SHR diet produced maximum SBP reductions of -22 or -26 mm Hg (P < 0.05), respectively after 3 wk. In comparison, the unhydrolyzed PPI produced a maximum SBP reduction of -17 mm Hg also after 3 wk. Potency of the pea products decreased in the 4th and 5th wk, though SBP values of the treated rats were still lower than the untreated control. We conclude that the antihypertensive potency of PPH-5 may have been due to the presence of easily absorbed hydrophilic peptides.", 
    "333": "The activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays an important role in the pathophysiology of congestive heart failure, which is the reason that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin 2 receptor blockers (ARBs) have become established therapies for heart failure. However, it is still not known whether preventive treatment with losartan or enalapril can reduce symptoms of infarction-induced heart failure. Ultra-low dose (ULD) drug therapy is thought to exert specific activity, with a lower chance of side effects. OBJECTIVES \u2022 The research team had hypothesized that preventive treatment with inhibitors of RAAS signaling-losartan, enalapril, and a preparation of a ULD antibody (ie, cardosten), which target the angiotensin type 1 (AT1) receptor-might alleviate pathological hypertrophy and/or functional decline in infarction-induced heart failure.",

The deterioration of cardiac output and the increase in total peripheral resistance (TPR) due to coronary ligation were significantly inhibited by both losartan and enalapril. The effects of cardosten were comparable with those of losartan and enalapril on cardiac morphology, left ventricular function, and TPR; however, it did not influence MABP. Moreover, in contrast to losartan and enalapril, cardosten did not decrease the rate of survival.",

Here, we studied the process and enzymes of O-GlcNAcylation with a special emphasis on Akt-endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and heat shock protein (HSP)72 signaling. Since tubular injury is the prominent site of DN, the effect of hyperglycemia was first measured in proximal tubular (HK2) cells cultured in high glucose. In vivo O-GlcNAcylation and protein levels of O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), O-GlcNAcase (OGA), phosphorylated (p)Akt/Akt, peNOS/eNOS, and HSP72 were assessed in the kidney cortex of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. The effects of various renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors were also evaluated. In proximal tubular cells, hyperglycemia-induced OGT expression led to increased O-GlcNAcylation, which was followed by a compensatory increase of OGA. In parallel, peNOS and pAkt levels decreased, whereas HSP72 increased. In diabetic rats, elevated O-GlcNAcylation was accompanied by decreased OGT and OGA. RAAS inhibitors ameliorated diabetes-induced kidney damage and prevented the elevation of O-GlcNAcylation and the decrement of pAkt, peNOS, and HSP72. In conclusion, hyperglycemia-induced elevation of O-GlcNAcylation contributes to the progression of DN via inhibition of Akt/eNOS phosphorylation and HSP72 induction. RAAS blockers successfully inhibit this process, suggesting a novel pathomechanism of their renoprotective action in the treatment of DN.", 
    "344": "Guidelines for the management of hypertension have recommended strict control of blood pressure to help prevent cardiovascular disease. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the current status of blood pressure control and trends over the past two decades. Four hundred patients treated for hypertension at Kyushu University Hospital were included in the present study. Blood pressure levels and prescribed antihypertensive drugs were examined in 2011. The average blood pressure was 129/74 mmHg, and the number of prescribed antihypertensive drugs was 2.2. Angiotensin II receptor antagonists, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, diuretics, alpha-blockers, and beta-blockers were prescribed in 66%, 5%, 78%, 21%, 12%, and 27% of the cases, respectively. Systolic blood pressure was significantly higher, and diastolic blood pressure was significantly lower in patients aged 80 years or older compared with the younger patients (<80 and \u226580 years, 128/75 mmHg and 133/68 mmHg, respectively). The number of prescribed antihypertensive drugs was similar between the two groups. Sixty-five patients were continuously treated for 20 years. The average blood pressure of these patients significantly decreased from 142/87 mmHg in 1991 to 128/71 mmHg in 2011, accompanied with an increase in the number of antihypertensive drugs from 1.6 in 1991 to 2.7 in 2011. These findings suggest that the revised guidelines for the management of hypertension may have contributed to increased awareness and better management of blood pressure levels.",

Mice were allocated into a control group, an LPS control group (0.8\u00a0mg/kg, i.p., once), a tempol (100\u00a0mg/kg/day, p.o., 7\u00a0days) treatment group, and two perindopril (0.5 and 1\u00a0mg/kg/day, p.o., 7\u00a0days) treatment groups. A behavioral study was conducted to evaluate spatial and nonspatial memory in mice, followed by a biochemical study involving assessment of brain levels of A\u03b2 and BDNF as Alzheimer and neuroplasticity markers; tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), nitric oxide end-products (NOx), neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) as inflammatory markers; and superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione reduced (GSH), and nitrotyrosine (NT) as oxido-nitrosative stress markers. Finally, histopathological examination of cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum sections was performed using both routine and special staining. Tempol and perindopril improved spatial and nonspatial memory in mice without affecting locomotor activity; decreased brain A\u03b2 deposition and BDNF depletion; decreased brain TNF-\u03b1, NOx, nNOS, iNOS, MDA, and NT levels; and increased brain SOD and GSH contents, parallel to confirmatory histopathological findings. Tempol and perindopril may be promising agents against AD progression via suppression of A\u03b2 deposition and BDNF decline, suppression of TNF-\u03b1 production, support of brain antioxidant status, and amelioration of oxido-nitrosative stress and NT production.", 
    "346": "Despite the large differences in the epidemiology of hypertension across Europe, treatment strategies are similar for national populations of white European descent. However, hypertensive patients of African or South Asian ethnicity may require ethnic-specific approaches, as these population subgroups tend to have higher blood pressure at an earlier age that is more difficult to control, a higher occurrence of diabetes, and more target organ damage with earlier cardiovascular mortality. Therefore, we systematically reviewed the evidence on antihypertensive drug treatment in South Asian and African ethnicity patients. We used the Cochrane systematic review methodology to retrieve trials in electronic databases including CENTRAL, PubMed, and Embase from their inception through November 2015; and with handsearch. We retrieved 4596 reports that yielded 35 trials with 7 classes of antihypertensive drugs in 25,540 African ethnicity patients. Aside from the well-known blood pressure efficacy of calcium channel blockers and diuretics, with lesser effect of ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers, nebivolol was not more effective than placebo in reducing systolic blood pressure levels. Trials with morbidity and mortality outcomes indicated that lisinopril and losartan-based therapy were associated with a greater incidence of stroke and sudden death. Furthermore, 1581 reports yielded 16 randomized controlled trials with blood pressure outcomes in 1719 South Asian hypertensive patients. In contrast with the studies in African ethnicity patients, there were no significant differences in blood pressure lowering efficacy between drugs, and no trials available with mortality outcomes. In conclusion, in patients of African ethnicity, treatment initiated with ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker monotherapy was associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes. We found no evidence of different efficacy of antihypertensive drugs in South Asians, but there is a need for trials with morbidity and mortality outcomes. Screening for cardiovascular risk at a younger age, treating hypertension at lower thresholds, and new delivery models to find, treat and follow hypertensives in the community may help reduce the excess cardiovascular mortality in these high-risk groups.", 
    "347": "Recently much attention has been paid to the possibly considerable role of the thrombophilic gene polymorphisms in the pathogenesis of deep venous thromboembolism (DVT). However, the reported results are controversial. Hence, this study aimed to disclose the association between factor VII (FVII) 10976G/A, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE; intron 16\u200aI/D), glycoprotein Ia (GPIa) 807C/T, tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA; intron 8\u200aD/I) and tissue-factor pathway inhibitor 536C/T polymorphisms and DVT. We investigated these gene polymorphisms in 693 study participants including 193 patients who showed clinical symptoms of DVT and 500 healthy individuals without both personal and family histories of thromboembolic disorders. Genotyping was performed using the amplification refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction (ARMS-PCR) technique. Comparison of genotypes distribution revealed that the FVII 10976G/A polymorphism was significantly related with DVT (P\u200a<\u200a0.05), whereas there was no association between the ACE (intron 16\u200aI/D), GPIa807C/T, t-PA (intron 8\u200aD/I) and tissue-factor pathway inhibitor 536C/T gene polymorphisms and DVT (P\u200a>\u200a0.05). In addition, the prevalence of homozygote genotype and mutant allele for FVII 10976G/A polymorphism was significantly higher in cases compared with controls (P\u200a<\u200a0.05). Taken together, our data provide evidence to support the hypothesis that FVII 10976G/A polymorphism may be associated with a predisposition to DVT.",

Plasma levels of D-dimer, PAI-1 and TGF-\u03b21 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and the determination of plasma levels of usCRP was performed by immunonephelometry. Data were analyzed by the software SigmaStat 2.03.",

Other laboratory parameters did not significantly differ among the three subgroups (P = 0.033). Despite not reaching statistical significance, plasma levels of usCRP were higher in patients carrying the D allele.", 
    "351": "ACE I/D polymorphisms could be associated with changes in the regulation of sodium, fibrinolytic system, and possibly, inflammation.

However, further studies with different experimental designs are necessary to elucidate the mechanisms involved in these associations.", 
    "352": "Adults with congenital heart disease represent a rapidly growing patient group. Dysfunction of the right ventricle is often present, and right heart failure constitutes the main cause of death. Heart failure therapies used in acquired left heart failure are often initiated in adults with right heart failure due to congenital heart disease, but the right ventricle differs substantially from the left ventricle, and the clinical evidence for this treatment strategy is lacking. In this review, we identified existing clinical studies evaluating the effects of ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers and aldosterone antagonists in adults with congenital heart disease by a systematic literature search. From 13 identified studies no clear evidence of beneficial effects was found, but the design of the studies limits the validity of the results. The studies in general include low numbers of patients, have short follow-up periods and evaluate surrogate endpoints instead of hard clinical endpoints. Specific evaluation of symptomatic patients with a systemic right ventricle indicates that these patients may benefit from RAAS inhibitory treatments, but this requires further investigation. To conclude, existing studies do not support the use of RAAS inhibitory treatments in right heart failure due to congenital heart disease but contain important limitations. Hence, there is a need for new well-designed trials including higher numbers of patients and validated endpoints to optimize and guide future treatment of this patient group.",

For statins, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for each percent adherence increase was about 7 times higher with IVR+ than with IVR ($6 and $43 for IVR and IVR+, respectively). Considering potential cost offsets from reduced cardiovascular events, the probability of breakeven was the highest for UC, but the IVR-based interventions had a higher probability of breakeven for subgroups with a baseline low-density lipoprotein (LDL) level of more than 100 mg/dl and those with two or more calls.",

All tested carotid vascular parameters were worse in patients with migraine including increased intima-media thickness, greater carotid diameter and carotid diameter change, as well as several arterial stiffness indices. Additionally, patients with migraine had greater incidence of homozygous mutations for procoagulant genes (MTHFR (C677T), PAI-1 and ACE I/D) than expected. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed WML in 11 patients, four of them migraine with aura patients.

Patients who failed to refill their medication for more than 1 day and had a proportion of days covered (PDC) < 0.8 were considered nonadherent and were contacted by a pharmacist by phone to identify adherence barriers. Two outcome variables were evaluated: The first was adherence to ACEIs/ARBs, defined as PDC during the 6 months following the phone call intervention. The second outcome variable was a categorical outcome of discontinuation versus continuation. Discontinuation was defined as not using ACEIs/ARBs during the 6-month post-intervention period. Patients who disenrolled from the plan in 2014 or were switched to another medication commonly used for treating DM and HTN were excluded from further analysis. Descriptive statistics were conducted to assess the frequency distribution of sample demographic characteristics at baseline. Multiple linear regression was conducted to assess the intervention effect on adherence during the 6 months post-intervention using the first outcome of post-intervention PDC, adjusting for baseline PDC and other covariates. Logistic regression was performed to assess the association between medication discontinuation and other baseline characteristics using the second outcome of discontinuation.

Seventy seven outpatients (mean age 43 years, 62 males) with diagnosed alcoholic CP were randomly enrolled into 5 study groups depending on the RAS inhibitors administered and their doses (2.5 or 5 mg and 12.5 or 25 mg for ramipril or losartan, respectively).

Previous studies documented that Ang-(1-7) acting via its own Mas receptor exerts vascular responses opposing those of Ang II. We studied the effects of the Ang-(1-7)/Mas receptor axis on the healing rate of acetic-acid-induced gastric ulcers with or without the blockade of Mas receptors by A 779 and compared it with the effects of activation and blockade of the AT-1 receptor by the treatment with Ang II and losartan, respectively, the inhibition of ACE by lisinopril, the NO/cNOS inhibition by L-NAME and inhibition of prostaglandin/COX system by indomethacin in the presence of Ang-(1-7). Additionally, ex vivo metabolism of Ang I in gastric tissue was assessed by LC/MS method. At day 9 after ulcer induction, the area of these ulcers and the accompanying changes in total gastric blood flow (GBF) were determined as were gastric mucosal blood flow (GMBF) at ulcer margin and gastric oxygen uptake (GVO2). The gastric mucosal expression of mRNAs for constitutive nitric oxide synthase (cNOS), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and plasma level of both cytokines were determined by RT-PCR and ELISA. The 9 days treatment with Ang II dose-dependently increased the area of gastric ulcers and this effect was accompanied by a significant fall in the GBF, GVO2 and GMBF at ulcer margin. In contrast, treatment with Ang-(1-7) which produced a significant rise in the luminal content of NO significantly reduced the area of gastric ulcer and significantly increased the GBF, GVO2 and the GMBF at ulcer margin. Similar GMBF changes and significant reduction the area of gastric ulcer was observed in rats with gastric ulcers treated with the agonist of Mas receptor, AVE 0991. These effects of Ang-(1-7) and AVE 0991 were eliminated by blockade of the Mas receptor with A779. Similarly to Ang-(1-7), treatment with losartan or lisinopril significantly reduced the area of gastric ulcers and the accompanying increase in the GMBF at ulcer margin and these effects were significantly attenuated by a concomitant administration of L-NAME and indomethacin. The rate of healing of ulcers was associated with a decrease in ex vivo Ang-(1-7) formation and this effect was attenuated by lisinopril. The treatment with Ang-(1- 7) or AVE 0991 increased the expression of mRNA for cNOS and SOD and downregulated that of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 followed by the decrease in the plasma IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 levels. We conclude that the Ang-(1-7)/Mas receptor system accelerates the healing of preexisting gastric ulcers via an increase in the gastric macro- and microcirculations, and an increase in gastric tissue oxygenation. These effects are mediated by PG and NO derived from overexpression of cNOS, an increase in the expression of antioxidizing enzyme SOD 2 and an anti-inflammatory action involving the inhibition of expression and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1. Our results seem to underlie the importance of the Ang-(1-7), AT-1 and Mas receptors in the regulation of local vascular and metabolic effects associated with mechanism of gastric ulcer healing.",

    "431": "Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays a pivotal role in treatment of chronic kidney diseases (CKD). However, reversal of the course of CKD or at least long-term stabilization of renal function are often difficult to achieve, and many patients still progress to end-stage renal disease. New treatments are needed to enhance protective actions of RAAS inhibitors (RAASis), such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and improve prognosis in CKD patients. Inhibition of endothelin (ET) system in combination with established RAASis may represent such an approach. There are complex interactions between both systems and similarities in their renal physiological and pathophysiological actions that provide theoretical rationale for combined inhibition. This view is supported by some experimental studies in models of both diabetic and nondiabetic CKD showing that a combination of RAASis with ET receptor antagonists (ERAs) ameliorate proteinuria, renal structural changes, and molecular markers of glomerulosclerosis, renal fibrosis, or inflammation more effectively than RAASis or ERAs alone. Practically all clinical studies exploring the effects of RAASis and ERAs combination in nephroprotection have thus far applied add-on designs, in which an ERA is added to baseline treatment with ACEIs or ARBs. These studies, conducted mostly in patients with diabetic nephropathy, have shown that ERAs effectively reduce residual proteinuria in patients with baseline RAASis treatment. Long-term studies are currently being conducted to determine whether promising antiproteinuric effects of the dual blockade will be translated in long-term nephroprotection with acceptable safety profile.",

The hydrogel formulations with acrylic acid and AMPS ratio of 4: 1 and lower amounts of crosslinker had shown maximum swelling. Moreover, higher release rate of captopril was observed at pH 7.4 than at pH 2, because of more swelling capacity of copolymer with increasing pH of the aqueous medium.

Most patients will reach ESRD before the age of 30 years, while a subset of them with milder mutations will do so at older ages, even after 50 years. Frequent extrarenal manifestations are hearing loss and ocular abnormalities. AS is a genetically heterogeneous collagen IV nephropathy, with 85% of the cases caused by mutations in the X-linked COL4A5 gene and the rest by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in either the COL4A3 or the COL4A4 gene on chromosome 2q36-37. There is no radical cure for the disease and attempts to use various stem cell therapies in animal models have been met with ambiguous success. However, effective treatment has been accomplished with pharmacological intervention at the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), first in animal models of AS and more recently in humans. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have been shown to significantly delay the progression of chronic kidney disease and the onset of ESRD. Also, renin inhibitors and aldosterone blockade were used with positive results, while the combination of ACEis and ARBs was met with mixed success.

Recently, new components of the RAS have been discovered, including angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), Angiotensin(Ang)-(1-7), Mas receptor, Ang-(1-9) and Alamandine. These new components of RAS are formed by the hydrolysis of Ang I and Ang II and, in general, counteract the effects of Ang II. In experimental models of heart and renal diseases, Ang-(1-7), Ang-(1-9) and Alamandine produced vasodilation, inhibition of cell growth, anti-thrombotic, anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects. Recent pharmacological strategies have been proposed to potentiate the effects or to enhance the formation of Ang-(1-7) and Ang-(1-9), including ACE2 activators, Ang-(1-7) in hydroxypropyl \u03b2-cyclodextrin, cyclized form of Ang-(1-7) and nonpeptide synthetic Mas receptor agonists.

Diuretics were virtually never used in monotherapy regimens but were used in more than 60 % of patients on dual antihypertensive therapy and in all patients assuming three or more drugs. There was no significant difference in the prevalence of use of any of the aforementioned drugs among patients with obesity of type I, II and III or between patients with or without metabolic syndrome.", 
    "478": "Our data show that no first choice protocol seems to be adopted in clinical practice for the treatment of obesity-related hypertension. Importantly, physicians do not seem to differentiate drug use according to the severity of obesity or to the presence of metabolic syndrome or to avoid drugs known to detrimentally affect body weight and metabolic profile in general population.", 
    "479": "To investigate the impact of doses of the drugs, which have been achieved during adjustment and account for less or more than 50% of the maximal therapeutic ones on the risk of rehospitalization.", 
    "480": "The data of the Pavlov Register were used to assess the treatment of patients with chronic heart failure. To assess the risk of rehospitalization in relation of the dose of a drug, all the doses were represented in percentage terms depending on the maximum therapeutic one.", 
    "481": "The risk of hospitalization during 6 months in the patients receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors at a dose of 25% or less of the therapeutic one was 21.18% (odds ratio (OR), 1.41; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.13-1.76), that at doses of 50 and 100% of the therapeutic one was 16% (OR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.56-0.88) and 34% (OR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.43-0.60), respectively. The risk of rehospitalization in the patients taking \u03b2-blockers at doses of 25, 50, and 100% of the therapeutic one was 26% (OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.94-1.17), 23% (OR, 0.902; 95% CI, 0.75-1.07), and 6.25% (OR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.07-0.56), respectively. The combined analysis of the dose and use frequency of diuretics showed that the highest risk of rehospitalization turned was noted in the patients using a single dose of 100 mg of furosemide (4.2% of cases) once weekly and was as high as 39% (OR, 0.45; 95% CI, 1.04-1.98).", 
    "482": "The risk of rehospitalization is largely determined by the dosing factor in outpatient settings. Increasing the doses during adjustment reduces the risk of rehospitalization.",

    "484": "Heart failure affects \u22485.7 million people in the United States alone. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, \u03b2-blockers, and aldosterone antagonists have improved mortality in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction, but mortality remains high. In July 2015, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the first of a new class of drugs for the treatment of heart failure: Valsartan/sacubitril (formerly known as LCZ696 and currently marketed by Novartis as Entresto) combines the angiotensin receptor blocker valsartan and the neprilysin inhibitor prodrug sacubitril in a 1:1 ratio in a sodium supramolecular complex. Sacubitril is converted by esterases to LBQ657, which inhibits neprilysin, the enzyme responsible for the degradation of the natriuretic peptides and many other vasoactive peptides. Thus, this combined angiotensin receptor antagonist and neprilysin inhibitor addresses 2 of the pathophysiological mechanisms of heart failure: activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and decreased sensitivity to natriuretic peptides. In the Prospective Comparison of ARNI With ACEI to Determine Impact on Global Mortality and Morbidity in Heart Failure (PARADIGM-HF) trial, valsartan/sacubitril significantly reduced mortality and hospitalization for heart failure, as well as blood pressure, compared with enalapril in patients with heart failure, reduced ejection fraction, and an elevated circulating level of brain natriuretic peptide or N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide. Ongoing clinical trials are evaluating the role of valsartan/sacubitril in the treatment of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and hypertension. We review here the mechanisms of action of valsartan/sacubitril, the pharmacological properties of the drug, and its efficacy and safety in the treatment of heart failure and hypertension.", 
    "485": "With the increased incidence of tuberculosis (TB) caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis there is an urgent need for new and better anti-tubercular drugs. N-succinyl-L,L-diaminopimelic acid desuccinylase (DapE) is a key enzyme in the succinylase pathway for the biosynthesis of meso-diaminopimelic acid (meso-DAP) and L-lysine. DapE is a zinc containing metallohydrolase which hydrolyses N-succinyl L,L diaminopimelic acid (L,L-NSDAP) to L,L-diaminopimelic acid (L,L-DAP) and succinate. M. tuberculosis DapE (MtDapE) was cloned, over-expressed and purified as an N-terminal hexahistidine ((His)6) tagged fusion containing one zinc ion per DapE monomer. We redesigned the DAP synthetic pathway to generate L,L-NSDAP and other L,L-NSDAP derivatives and have characterised MtDapE with these substrates. In contrast to its other Gram negative homologues, the MtDapE was insensitive to inhibition by L-captopril which we show is consistent with novel mycobacterial alterations in the binding site of this drug.",

It is usually administered in conjunction with other heart failure therapies, instead of an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin-receptor blocker (ARB). In studies, sacubitril/ valsartan was superior to enalapril in reducing the risks of death and hospitalization for heart failure. Possible side effects of sacubitril/valsartan are hypotension, angioedema, impaired renal function and elevation in serum potassium levels. The drug should not be used in times of pregnancy and breast feeding, in patients with servere hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) and in combination with aliskiren in patients with diabetes.", 
    "493": "With high mortality and readmission rates among patients with heart failure (HF), multiple disease management models have been and continue to be tested, with mixed results. Early postdischarge care improves outcomes for patients. Telemonitoring also can assist in reducing mortality and HF-related hospitalizations. Office-based team care improves patient outcomes, with important components including rapid access to physicians, partnerships with clinical pharmacists, education, monitoring, and support. Pay-for-performance measures developed for HF, primarily use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta blockers, also improve patient outcomes, but the influence of adherence to other measures has been minimal. Evaluating comorbid conditions, including diabetes and hypertension, and making drug adjustments for patients with HF to include blood pressure control and use of metformin, when possible, can reduce mortality and morbidity.", 
    "494": "Outpatient management of heart failure (HF) is aimed at treating symptoms and preventing hospitalizations and readmissions. Management is initiated in a stepwise approach. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system is a cornerstone of therapy and should be started, along with beta blockers, as soon as the diagnosis of HF is made. Other drugs, including diuretics, aldosterone antagonists, hydralazine, and nitrates, may be added based on symptoms and American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association stage. Despite a great interest in and theoretical benefit of naturoceutical products in the mitigation of oxidative stress and HF progression, none has been proven to be beneficial, and concerns exist regarding their interactions with standard HF drugs. Other nonpharmacologic interventions, including sodium restriction, regular exercise, and/or cardiac rehabilitation, should be initiated at diagnosis. HF often is progressive, and clinicians should be aware of late stage management options, including implantable devices, cardiac transplantation, and hospice care.",

We report a case of life-threatening angioedema. The case was a 60-year-old man who had been taking an ACE inhibitor for hypertension for 11 years. He visited his home doctor for dyspnea, and tongue and neck swelling. He was transported to our hospital because of the possibility of airway obstruction. On admission, his tongue and neck swelling became more severe. We performed an intubation using an endoscope and started airway management. We also stopped his ACE inhibitor. The severe tongue and neck swelling improved gradually and he was extubated on day 3. On the fifth day he was discharged. We diagnosed angioedema caused by an ACE inhibitor. Although the risk of airway obstruction with ACE inhibitors is acknowledged, we have only a superficial understanding of how prolonged ACE inhibitor treatment induces angioedema. So we should consider angioedema in cases of taking ACE inhibitors, especially in cases of prolonged treatment.",

Therefore, we aimed to determine whether PIMO or benazepril produces adverse cardiac effects in healthy cats. This was a blinded, randomized, prospective parallel study. Twelve cats were randomly divided into two groups of six cats, namely, an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor group that received benazepril and a PIMO group. Cats were administered their respective treatments for 506 days, and we evaluated cardiac parameters, blood biochemistry and glomerular filtration rates during that time. At the end of the trial, the cats were euthanized, and histopathological examinations were performed by a pathologist who was blinded to the treatment groups. No significant changes were observed in any of the parameters measured in either of the groups. In particular, no significant cardiac lesions were observed in either of the groups. In healthy cats, neither PIMO nor benazepril appears to cause cardiac lesions, but future studies are needed to examine the effects of PIMO in cats with heart disease.", 
    "497": "An 8-AA (8mer) fragment (PFPEVFGK) of a known antihypertensive peptide derived from bovine \u03b1S1-casein (C12 antihypertensive peptide) was synthesized by microwave-assisted solid-phase peptide synthesis and purified by reverse phase HPLC. Its ability to inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) was assessed and compared with that of the parent 12mer peptide (FFVAPFPEVFGK) to determine the effect of truncating the sequence on overall hypotensive activity. The activity of the truncated 8mer peptide was found to be almost 1.5 times less active than that of the 12mer, with ACE-inhibiting IC50 (half-maximal inhibitory concentration) values of 108 and 69\u03bcM, for the 8mer and 12mer, respectively. Although the 8mer peptide is less active than the original 12mer peptide, its overall activity is comparable to activities reported for other small proteins that elicit physiological responses within humans. These results suggest that microbial degradation of the 12mer peptide would not result in a complete loss of antihypertensive activity if used to supplement fermented foods and that the stable 8mer peptide could have potential as a blood pressure-lowering agent for use in functional foods.", 
    "498": "Etoposide is a topoisomerase II enzyme inhibitor type chemotherapeutic agent which is widely used in the therapy of various cancers. Its short half-life and toxicity to normal tissues are the major drawbacks in its clinical applications. Polymeric nanoparticulate drug delivery systems are rational carriers to deliver etoposide with higher efficiency and fewer side effects. In addition tubular shaped drug carriers are found to show a great potential for drug delivery on the basis of promising results regarding particle shape and cellular uptake. In this study, etoposide loaded polymeric tubular nanocarriers have been developed by template wetting method using porous anodic aluminum oxide membranes as templates. The developed poly(methyl methacrylate) nanocarriers were evaluated for structural analysis, in vitro drug release studies and drug release kinetics. Accurate and reliable determination of the drug release from newly developed nanocarriers, is of great importance. For this reason a selective and sensitive reversed phase liquid chromatography method was developed and fully validated from the point of system suitability, specificity, linearity and range, limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantification (LOQ), precision, accuracy and robustness for the reliable determination of etoposide. Stability indicating capability was shown with forced degradation studies and the chromatographic conditions were optimized on ACE 5C18 (150 mm \u00d7 4.6mm I.D., 5 \u03bcm) analytical column. Related to the calibration results ETP was found linear in the range between 0.2 from 100 \u03bcg mL(-1) with the LOD as 0.015 \u03bcg.mL(-1). The resultant conditions were applied for the selective and sensitive determination of etoposide from its commercial dosage form with the high accuracy values (99.82-100.65%).

    "505": "Previously, management of hypertension has concentrated on lowering elevated blood pressure. However, the target has shifted to reducing absolute cardiovascular (CV) risk. It is estimated that two in three Australian adults have three or more CV risk factors at the same time. Moderate reductions in several risk factors can, therefore, be more effective than major reductions in one. When managing hypertension, therapy should be focused on medications with the strongest evidence for CV event reduction, substituting alternatives only when a primary choice is not appropriate. Hypertension management guidelines categorise angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) interchangeably as first-line treatments in uncomplicated hypertension. These medications have different mechanisms of action and quite different evidence bases. They are not interchangeable and their prescription should be based on clinical evidence. Despite this, currently ARB prescriptions are increasing at a higher rate than those for ACEI and other antihypertensive classes. Evidence that ACEI therapy prevents CV events and death, in patients with coronary artery disease or multiple CV risk factors, emerged from the European trial on reduction of cardiac events with perindopril in stable coronary artery disease (EUROPA) and Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) trials respectively. The consistent benefit has been demonstrated in meta-analyses. The clinical trial data for ARB are less consistent, particularly regarding CV outcomes and mortality benefit. The evidence supports the use of ACEI (Class 1a) compared with ARB despite current prescribing trends.", 
    "506": "To investigate the effects of calcitriol on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and ACE2 in diabetic nephropathy. Streptozotocin (STZ) induced diabetic rats were treated with calcitriol for 16 weeks. ACE/ACE2 and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) enzymes were measured in the kidneys of diabetic rats and rat renal tubular epithelial cells exposed to high glucose. Calcitriol reduced proteinuria in diabetic rats without affecting calcium-phosphorus metabolism. ACE and ACE2 levels were significantly elevated in diabetic rats compared to those in control rats. The increase in ACE levels was greater than that of ACE2, leading to an elevated ACE/ACE2 ratio. Calcitriol reduced ACE levels and ACE/ACE2 ratio and increased ACE2 levels in diabetic rats. Similarly, high glucose up-regulated ACE expression in NRK-52E cells, which was blocked by the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580, but not the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitor FR180204 or the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor SP600125. High glucose down-regulated ACE2 expression, which was blocked by FR180204, but not SB203580 or SP600125. Incubation of cells with calcitriol significantly inhibited p38 MAPK and ERK phosphorylation, but not JNK phosphorylation, and effectively attenuated ACE up-regulation and ACE2 down-regulation in high glucose conditions. The renoprotective effects of calcitriol in diabetic nephropathy were related to the regulation of tubular levels of ACE and ACE2, possibly by p38 MAPK or ERK, but not JNK pathways.",

Using the CCS \"Best Practices for Developing Cardiovascular Quality Indicators\" methodology, a total of 49 \"long-list\" QIs was identified and rated. Subsequent ranking and discussion led to the selection of an initial \"short-list\" of 6 QIs to evaluate quality care, including daily assessment of blood chemistry indicators, chest radiography, patient education, in-hospital use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers, assessment of left ventricular function, and 30-day hospital readmission. The short-list QIs were selected as being important for quality assurance and because the patient information, for the most part, can be captured during the inpatient setting, which would allow these QIs to be adopted more easily. These 6 QIs were subjected to a feasibility test that found that even within the inpatient setting, there is a significant gap between the existing knowledge infrastructure and the necessary information-tracking processes to measure QIs. Only 1 QI (30-day hospital readmission) can currently be measured comparatively across Canada, although the other 5 of 6 short-list QIs can be measured using other data collected by jurisdictions. Standardization and enhancements to knowledge infrastructure are essential to provide the comprehensive patient data necessary to evaluate the quality of HF care across Canada.",

    "519": "N-acetyl-seryl-aspartyl-lysyl-proline (Ac-SDKP) is a natural tetrapeptide with anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic properties. Previously, we have shown that prolyl oligopeptidase (POP) is involved in the Ac-SDKP release from thymosin-\u03b24 (T\u03b24). However, POP can only hydrolyze peptides shorter than 30 amino acids, and T\u03b24 is 43 amino acids long. This indicates that before POP hydrolysis takes place, T\u03b24 is hydrolyzed by another peptidase that releases NH2-terminal intermediate peptide(s) with fewer than 30 amino acids. Our peptidase database search pointed out meprin-\u03b1 metalloprotease as a potential candidate. Therefore, we hypothesized that, prior to POP hydrolysis, T\u03b24 is hydrolyzed by meprin-\u03b1. In vitro, we found that the incubation of T\u03b24 with both meprin-\u03b1 and POP released Ac-SDKP, whereas no Ac-SDKP was released when T\u03b24 was incubated with either meprin-\u03b1 or POP alone. Incubation of T\u03b24 with rat kidney homogenates significantly released Ac-SDKP, which was blocked by the meprin-\u03b1 inhibitor actinonin. In addition, kidneys from meprin-\u03b1 knockout (KO) mice showed significantly lower basal Ac-SDKP amount, compared with wild-type mice. Kidney homogenates from meprin-\u03b1 KO mice failed to release Ac-SDKP from T\u03b24. In vivo, we observed that rats treated with the ACE inhibitor captopril increased plasma concentrations of Ac-SDKP, which was inhibited by the coadministration of actinonin (vehicle, 3.1 \u00b1 0.2 nmol/l; captopril, 15.1 \u00b1 0.7 nmol/l; captopril + actinonin, 6.1 \u00b1 0.3 nmol/l; P < 0.005). Similar results were obtained with urinary Ac-SDKP after actinonin treatment. We conclude that release of Ac-SDKP from T\u03b24 is mediated by successive hydrolysis involving meprin-\u03b1 and POP.",

Overall, the majority of beta-1 blockers studied significantly lowered systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). In people with mild to moderate hypertension, beta-1 selective blockers lowered BP by an average of -10/-8 mmHg and reduced heart rate by 11 beats per minute. The maximum BP reduction of beta-1 blockers occurred at twice the starting dose. Individual beta-1 blockers did not exhibit a graded dose-response effect on SBP and DBP over the recommended dose range.Most beta-1 blockers tested significantly lowered heart rate. A graded dose-response of beta-1 blockers on heart rate was evident. Higher dose beta-1 blockers lowered heart rate more than lower doses.

Beta-1 selective blockers lowered BP by a greater magnitude than dual receptor beta-blockers and partial agonist beta-blockers, lowered BP similarly to nonselective beta-blockers. Beta-1 selective blockers lowered SBP by a similar degree and lowered DBP by a greater degree than diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers.

We investigated the effect of additional vasodilating treatment on coronary and peripheral resistance circulation in EH patients with high systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) despite well-treated blood pressure (BP). We enroled patients on stable antihypertensive treatment that were given intensified vasodilating therapy (ACE inhibitor, angiotensin II receptor blocker or calcium channel blocker). Before and following 6 months of intensified therapy, coronary resting and maximal artery flow were measured by transthoracic Doppler echocardiography to calculate coronary flow reserve (CFR) and minimum vascular resistance (C-Rmin). Cardiac output was estimated by inert gas rebreathing to calculate SVRI. Maximal forearm blood flow was determined by venous occlusion plethysmography to calculate minimum vascular resistance (F-Rmin). Patients were assigned into two groups: high-SVRI and low-SVRI subgroups, based on a median split at baseline. Following additional treatment SVRI decreased more in the high-SVRI group than in the low-SVRI group (14.4 vs -2.2%: P=0.003), despite similar baseline ambulatory BP (132/81\u2009mm\u2009Hg) and BP reduction (6.5 and 4.6%: P=0.19). F-Rmin remained unchanged (6.5 vs -2.0%: P=0.30), while C-Rmin decreased by 22 and 24% (P=0.80) and CFR increased by 23 and 17% (P=0.16). Thus, intensified vasodilating therapy improved SVRI more in patients with high SVRI than in those with low SVRI. Regardless of SVRI status, the treatment improved cardiac but not forearm dilatation capacity. The substantial improvement of the hypertensive cardiac microvascular dysfunction was not related to the reduction in SVRI.",

This multilayers film can effectively recognize captopril by resonance energy transfer from graphite oxide to silver nanoparticles. A new interfacial sensing method for captopril with high signal to noise ratio was established, by means of that multilayers was quenched by silver nanoparticles and subsequently recovered by adding captopril. The linear relation between intensity and captopril concentration was good, and the detection limit was found to be 0.1578 \u03bcM.

In this study, we develop a simple interface which coupled droplet segmented system to a venturi easy ambient sonic-spray ionization mass spectrometer. It is fabricated by using a single capillary to act as both sampling probe and the emitter, which simplifies the construction, reduces the cost and shorten the sampling time. Samples sucked by venturi effect are segmented to nanoliter plugs by air, then the plugs can be detected by MS directly. This system eliminated the need for flow injection which was popular used in classic scheme. The new system is applied to screen angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. High-throughput was achieved in analyzing 96 samples at 1.6\u00a0s per sample. The plugs formation was at 0.5s per sample. Carry-over between samples was less than 5%, the peak height RSD was 2.92% (n\u00a0=\u00a015).

Angiotensin covering enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy and calcium antagonist were effective for his renal condition. Although an association between SRC and anti-RNAP III antibody has already been reported in patients with diffuse cutaneous SSc (Dc SSc), this case indicates that SRC with hypetensive emergency with malignant nephrosclerosis can also be diagnosed on patients with Lc SSc patients by the examination of anti-RNAP III antibody.",

Here, we demonstrate that the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AGTR1) antagonist attenuate tumor growth via polarization of neutrophils toward an antitumoral phenotype. The ACEis or AGTR1 antagonist enhanced hypersegmentation of human neutrophils and increased neutrophil cytotoxicity against tumor cells. This neutrophil hypersegmentation was dependent on the mTOR pathway. In a murine tumor model, ACEis and AGTR1 antagonist attenuated tumor growth and enhanced neutrophil hypersegmentation. ACEis inhibited tumor-induced polarization of neutrophils to a protumoral phenotype. Neutrophil depletion reduced the antitumor effect of ACEi. Together, these data suggest that the modulation of Ang II pathway attenuates tumor growth via polarization of neutrophils to an antitumoral phenotype.", 
    "568": "No specific or efficient treatment exists for Alport syndrome, an X-linked hereditary disease caused by mutations in collagen type IV, a crucial component of the glomerular basement membrane. Kidney failure is usually a major complication of the disease, and patients require renal replacement therapy early in life. Microhematuria and subsequently proteinuria are hallmarks of kidney involvement, which are due to primary basement membrane alterations that mainly cause endothelial thrombosis and podocyte contraction and ulterior irreversible detachment. Commonly drug-based approaches include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, which are employed to reduce proteinuria and thus retard kidney disease progression and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. However, as any hereditary disease, it is expressed as early as in the intrauterine life, and usually an index case is helpful to detect family-related cases. As no specific treatment exists, pathophysiologically based approaches are useful. The present case illustrates the reduction rate of urinary podocyte loss and proteinuria after amiloride administration and suggests the molecular pathways involved in Alport renal disease. Finally, podocyturia rather than proteinuria should be considered as an earlier biomarker of kidney involvement and disease progression in Alport disease.",

Rats were treated with l-NAME (40 mg/kg/day) for five weeks and given CT extract (75 or 150 or 300 or 500 mg/kg/day): captopril (5 mg/kg/day) or CT extract (300 mg/kg/day) plus captopril (5 mg/kg/day) for two consecutive weeks. CT extract reduced blood pressure dose-dependently, and the most effective dose was 300 mg/kg/day. l-NAME-induced hypertensive rats showed abnormalities including high blood pressure, high vascular resistance, impairment of acetylcholine-induced vasorelaxation in isolated aortic rings and mesenteric vascular beds, increased vascular superoxide production and plasma malondialdehyde levels, downregulation of eNOS, low level of plasma nitric oxide metabolites, upregulation of angiotensin II type 1 receptor and increased plasma angiotensin II. These abnormalities were alleviated by treatment with either CT extract or captopril. Combination treatment of CT extract and captopril normalized all the abnormalities found in hypertensive rats except endothelial dysfunction. These data indicate that there are synergistic antihypertensive effects of CT extract and captopril. These effects are likely mediated by their anti-oxidative properties and their inhibition of RAS.",

Due to higher cardiovascular risk, this disorder requires special diagnosis and treatment. The heterogeneous etiology, risk factors and comorbidities of resistant hypertension stand in need of sophisticated evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and select the best therapeutic options, which should consider lifestyle modifications as well as pharmacological and interventional treatment. After having excluded pseudohypertension, inappropriate blood pressure measurement and control as well as the white coat effect, suspicion of resistant hypertension requires an analysis of drugs which the hypertensive patient is treated with. According to one definition - ineffective treatment with 3 or more antihypertensive drugs including diuretics makes it possible to diagnose resistant hypertension. A multidrug therapy including angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, beta blockers, diuretics, long-acting calcium channel blockers and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists has been demonstrated to be effective in resistant hypertension treatment. Nevertheless, optional, innovative therapies, e.g. a renal denervation or baroreflex activation, may create a novel pathway of blood pressure lowering procedures. The right diagnosis of this disease needs to eliminate the secondary causes of resistant hypertension e.g. obstructive sleep apnea, atherosclerosis and renal or hormonal disorders.

We documented 948 ovarian cancer cases during follow-up. Similar results were observed in the two cohorts. While hypertension was not associated with ovarian cancer risk (Pooled HR\u2009=\u20091.01; 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.88, 1.16), current use of any antihypertensive medication was associated with slightly increased risk compared to never users (Pooled HR\u2009=\u20091.18; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.37). This increased risk was primarily due to use of thiazide diuretics (Pooled HR\u2009=\u20091.37; 95% CI: 1.13, 1.68). No associations were observed for beta-blockers or angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors.

Case\u2003We report a 31-week gestation premature male infant who did not respond to such treatment and developed hyperaldosteronism and severe hypokalemia secondary to activation of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system. The hypokalemia was not responsive to intravenous KCL supplementation and induced digoxin toxicity despite a relatively normal digoxin level. The earliest signs of digoxin toxicity in the patient were junctional rhythm and bradycardia. The discontinuation of digoxin and the administration of digoxin specific immunoglobulin fragments (Fab) reversed those changes. The addition of spironolactone (an aldosterone antagonist) had a dramatic effect, resulting in clinical improvement of the patient coupled with normalization of Q4 serum and urine electrolytes. Conclusion\u2003Serum Digoxin level alone may fail as an independent guide in the diagnosis of digoxin toxicity when hypokalemia is present. In premature infants with congestive heart failure and hypokalemia, addition of an aldosterone antagonist should be considered.",

These descriptors codify chemical information for relations between two, three and four atoms by using several (dis-)similarity metrics and multi-metrics. Several studies aimed at assessing the quality of these novel descriptors have been performed. However, a deeper analysis of their performance is necessary. Therefore, in the present manuscript an assessment and statistical validation of the performance of these novel descriptors in QSAR studies is performed.",

Three to nine variable QSAR models based on Multiple Linear Regression are built for each chemical dataset according to the original division into training/test sets. Comparisons with respect to leave-one-out cross-validation correlation coefficients[Formula: see text] reveal that the models based on QuBiLS-MIDAS indices possess superior predictive ability in 7 of the 8 datasets analyzed, outperforming methodologies based on similar or more complex techniques such as: Partial Least Square, Neural Networks, Support Vector Machine and others. On the other hand, superior external correlation coefficients[Formula: see text] are attained in 6 of the 8 test sets considered, confirming the good predictive power of the obtained models. For the [Formula: see text] values non-parametric statistic tests were performed, which demonstrated that the models based on QuBiLS-MIDAS indices have the best global performance and yield significantly better predictions in 11 of the 12 QSAR procedures used in the comparison. Lastly, a study concerning to the performance of the indices according to several conformer generation methods was performed. This demonstrated that the quality of predictions of the QSAR models based on QuBiLS-MIDAS indices depend on 3D structure generation method considered, although in this preliminary study the results achieved do not present significant statistical differences among them.",

We determined the size distribution (laser diffraction method), morphology (scanning electron microscopy) and a specific surface area of the powder particles (by nitrogen adsorption-desorption). For the determination of the surface energy of powder mixtures the method of inverse gas chromatography was applied. Investigated mixtures were characterized by surface parameters (dispersive component of surface energy, specific interactions parameters, specific surface area), work of adhesion and cohesion as well as Flory-Huggins parameter \u03c723('). Results obtained for all quaternary powder mixtures indicate existence of interactions between components.

Although the exact mechanisms by which ACE inhibitors and ARBs may work for migraine prophylaxis are unknown, there are several plausible hypotheses as to why modulating the activity of the renin angiotensin system could result in migraine prevention. Clinical trials of ACE inhibitors and ARBs provide evidence that they are effective and generally well tolerated when used for migraine prophylaxis. Based upon biologic plausibility, the quality of evidence for efficacy from clinical trials, and recommendations in published guidelines, we consider ACE inhibitors and ARBs as second- or third-line options for migraine prophylaxis.",

We tested the curative potential of the non brain-penetrant ACEi enalapril (3\u200amg/kg/day) administered for 3 months either alone or in combination with the brain penetrant ARB losartan (10\u200amg/kg/day) in aged (\u223c15 months) transgenic mice overexpressing a mutated form of the human amyloid-\u03b2 protein precursor (A\u03b2PP, thereafter APP mice). We studied cerebrovascular function, protein levels of oxidative stress markers (superoxide dismutases SOD1, SOD2 and the NADPH oxidase subunit p67phox), amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) pathology, astrogliosis, cholinergic innervation, AT1R and angiotensin IV receptor (AT4R) levels, together with cognitive performance. Both treatments normalized cerebrovascular reactivity and p67phox protein levels, but they did not reduce the cerebrovascular levels of SOD1. Combined treatment normalized cerebrovascular SOD2 levels, significantly attenuated astrogliosis, but did not reduce the increased levels of cerebrovascular AT1R. Yet, combined therapy enhanced thioflavin-S labeled A\u03b2 plaque burden, a tendency not significant when A\u03b21\u00a0-\u00a042 plaque load was considered. None of the treatments rescued cognitive deficits, cortical AT4R or cholinergic innervation. We conclude that both treatments normalized cerebrovascular function by inhibiting the AngII-induced oxidative stress cascade, and that the positive effects of the combined therapy on astrogliosis were likely due to the ability of losartan to enter brain parenchyma. However, enalapril did not potentiate, and may even dampen, the reported cognitive benefits of losartan, raising caution when selecting the most appropriate antihypertensive therapy in AD patients.", 
    "615": "Animal aging is characterized by progressive, degenerative changes in many organ systems. Because age-related degeneration is a major contributor to disability and death in humans, treatments that delay age-related degeneration are desirable. However, no drugs that delay normal human aging are currently available. To identify drugs that delay age-related degeneration, we used the powerful Caenorhabditis elegans model system to screen for FDA-approved drugs that can extend the adult lifespan of worms. Here we show that captopril extended mean lifespan. Captopril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor used to treat high blood pressure in humans. To explore the mechanism of captopril, we analyzed the acn-1 gene that encodes the C. elegans homolog of ACE. Reducing the activity of acn-1 extended the mean life span. Furthermore, reducing the activity of acn-1 delayed age-related degenerative changes and increased stress resistance, indicating that acn-1 influences aging. Captopril could not further extend the lifespan of animals with reduced acn-1, suggesting they function in the same pathway; we propose that captopril inhibits acn-1 to extend lifespan. To define the relationship with previously characterized longevity pathways, we analyzed mutant animals. The lifespan extension caused by reducing the activity of acn-1 was additive with caloric restriction and mitochondrial insufficiency, and did not require sir-2.1, hsf-1 or rict-1, suggesting that acn-1 functions by a distinct mechanism. The interactions with the insulin/IGF-1 pathway were complex, since the lifespan extensions caused by captopril and reducing acn-1 activity were additive with daf-2 and age-1 but required daf-16. Captopril treatment and reducing acn-1 activity caused similar effects in a wide range of genetic backgrounds, consistent with the model that they act by the same mechanism. These results identify a new drug and a new gene that can extend the lifespan of worms and suggest new therapeutic strategies for addressing age-related degenerative changes.",

The main challenge with antihypertensive (AHT) drug therapy is their extreme hydrophobic nature and very low oral bio-availability; which result into higher dosage/frequency and associated side effects of drugs. The main objective of this study was to fabricate AHT nano-ceuticals in hydrophilic carriers of natural origin to improve drugs' solubility, protection and sustained release. AHT nano-carrier systems (NCS) encapsulating captopril, amlodipine and valsartan were fabricated using chitosan (CS) polymer by ionic gelation assisted ultra-sonication method. Drug encapsulation efficiencies of 92\u00b11.6%, 91\u00b10.9% and 87\u00b10.5% were observed for captopril, valsartan and amlodipine respectively. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) based analysis had revealed that captopril loaded polymeric NCS were regular, smooth and without any agglomeration. FTIR analyses of drug loaded and empty NCS demonstrated that drugs were molecularly dispersed inside the nanoparticles via week hydrogen bonding. Captopril and valsartan have demonstrated grafting reaction with N-H group of chitosan. Zeta sizer results had confirmed that average size of chitosan nanoparticles was below 100 nm. Encapsulation of captopril had reduced the surface charge value from +52.6\u00b14.8 to +46.5\u00b15.2 mV. Controlled release evaluation of highly encapsulated drug captopril had revealed a slow release in vitro from NCS in physiological buffer.

    "621": "Resistin, an adipokine involved in insulin resistance (IR) and diabetes, has recently been reported to play a role in cardiovascular events. However, its effect on blood pressure (BP) and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In the present study, we showed that resistin induces hypertension and IR in wild type (WT) mice, but not in tlr4(-/-) mice. Resistin upregulated angiotensinogen (Agt) expression in WT mice, whereas it had no effect on tlr4(-/-) mice, or in mice treated with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril. Real-time PCR and chromatin immunoprecipitation further confirmed that resistin activates the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) via the TLR4/P65/Agt pathway. This finding suggested an essential role of resistin in linking IR and hypertension, which may offer a novel target in clinic on the study of the association between diabetes and hypertension.",

    "660": "In healthy rats, the physiological variation of baseline endothelial function of intrarenal arteries correlates with the severity of renal damage in response to a subsequent specific renal injury. However, whether such a variation in endothelial function may also condition or predict the variable response to angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibiting treatment in these individuals has not been addressed before. To study this, 5/6 nephrectomy was performed to induce renal injury and chronic kidney disease in a group of healthy Wistar rats. At the time of nephrectomy, interlobar arteries were obtained from the extirpated right kidney and studied in vitro for endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine. Six weeks thereafter, treatment with lisinopril was started (n = 11) and continued for 9 wk. Proteinuria (metabolic cages) and systolic blood pressure (SBP; tail cuff) were evaluated weekly, and these were analyzed in relation to renal endothelial function at baseline. 5/6 Nephrectomy induced an increase in SBP and progressive proteinuria. Treatment with lisinopril reduced SBP and slowed proteinuria, albeit to a variable degree among individuals. The acetylcholine-induced renal artery dilation at baseline negatively correlated with lisinopril-induced reduction of proteinuria (r(2) = 0.648, P = 0.003) and with the decrease in SBP (r(2) = 0.592, P = 0.006). Our data suggest that angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitor attenuates the progression of renal damage the most in those individuals with decreased basal renal endothelial-mediated vasodilation.", 
    "661": "Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease and outcomes in women, and antihypertensive therapy is not always successful in achieving control over the blood pressure (BP). Nonoptimal control of BP remains a crucial risk factor for cardiovascular mortality, and in women, it could be related to sex-specific factors. Historically, women have been under-represented in clinical trials; therefore, the benefits of clinical outcomes and the safety profiles of antihypertensive therapies have been studied less extensively in women. The reasons for the sex differences in BP levels are multifactorial, implying different roles of the sex hormones, the renin-angiotensin system, sympathetic activity, and arterial stiffness. A complete understanding of the pathophysiological features of these differences requires further investigation.Nevertheless, the prevalence of the use of antihypertensive agents is higher among middle-aged women than among men. Notably, in the United States, hypertensive women use more diuretics and angiotensin receptor blockers than men, whereas hypertensive men more often receive beta-blockers, calcium channel antagonists, or inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme. To date, the explanations for these sex differences in the consumption of antihypertensive drugs remain unknown.",

The aim of this study was to establish which sociodemographic factors influence adherence to standards of care for chronic heart failure (CHF). A generalized multilevel structural equation model was developed and applied to a sample of patients with CHF obtained from administrative data flows in six Italian regions to ascertain any associations between adherence to standards of care for CHF and sociodemographic variables. Indicators of compliance were adherence to beta-blocker therapy (BB-A) and Angiotensin Convertin Enzime inhibitor/Angiotensin Receptor Blocker therapy (ACE-A), and creatinine and electrolyte testing (CNK-T). All indicators were computed over a one-year follow-up. Among a cohort of 24,997 patients, the BB-A rate was 40.4%, the ACE-A rate 61.1%, and the CNK-T rate 57.0%. Factors found associated with adherence were gender, age, and citizenship. Our study shows an inadequate adherence to standards of care for CHF, particularly associated with certain sociodemographic characteristics. This suggests the need to improve the role of primary care in managing this chronic condition.

Patients treated for cSDH between 2009 and 2013 at our institution were included in this retrospective case-control study. Medical charts were reviewed retrospectively and data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Out of 203 patients (58 females, mean age 73.2years), 53 (26%) patients were on ACE inhibitors before their presentation with cSDH. Median initial hematoma volume in individuals with ACE inhibitors (179.2\u00b1standard error of the mean [SEM] 13.0ml) was significantly higher compared to patients without ACE inhibitors (140.4\u00b1SEM 6.2ml; p=0.007).

ACE inhibitors are associated with higher hematoma volume in patients with cSDH and with a higher frequency of recurrences requiring surgery (especially in the very old). We hypothesize that these effects are due to ACE inhibitor induced bradykinin elevation causing increased vascular permeability of the highly vascularized neomembranes in cSDH.",

White New Zealand rabbits that underwent coronary artery ligature or Sham were divided in three experimental groups: (1) Sham, (2) MI, and (3) MI+Enal. Enal was given by gavage at a dose of 10mg/kg/day starting at 3h after surgery for 35days. At the end of the protocol, we measured (1) mean arterial pressure, (2) left ventricular (LV)+dP/dtmax, (3) LV end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and isovolumic relaxation (Tau), (4) LV dimensions, (5) LV ejection and shortening fraction, (6) infarct size (Masson's trichrome-stained slices), (7) fibrosis in the infarct and remote zone (Picrosirius red-stained slices), and (8) myocyte cross-sectional area (MCSA) in WGA-stained section. Enal reduced the mean arterial pressure by 30% as compared with untreated animals and Sham (P<.05). MI reduced LV+dP/dtmax and LV-dP/dtmax (mmHg/s), increased LVEDP (mmHg), Tau (ms), and t50 (ms) values, suggesting a decrease in the relaxation rate. LV end-diastolic dimension and LV end-systolic dimension (LVESD, mm) increased in untreated MI (P<.05 vs. Sham). In contrast, Enal markedly prevented post-MI diastolic dysfunction by significantly decrease LVEDP from 8.2\u00b10.2 to 5.1\u00b10.3mmHg, Tau from 19.8\u00b10.8 to 15.3\u00b10.9ms, and t50 from 12.4\u00b10.5 to 9.6\u00b10.8ms as well as reduced LVESD from 15\u00b11.1 to 12\u00b10.8mm (P<.05 MI vs. MI+Enal). Collagen concentration in the scar was unaffected, but chronic treatment with Enal prevented myocardial fibrosis and MCSA in the remote zone. In summary, chronic early administration of Enal to rabbits with experimental MI has a favorable effect on ventricular remodeling and diastolic function by reducing MCSA and fibrosis, without affecting the wound healing.",

Age and mean HbA1c were strongly associated with any-CVD and with MACE. For each percentage point increase in mean HbA1c, the risk for any-CVD and for MACE increased by 31 and 42%, respectively. CVD and MACE were associated with seven other conventional factors, such as blood pressure, lipids, and lack of ACE inhibitor use, but not with sex. The areas under the receiver operating characteristics curves for the association of age and HbA1c, taken together with any-CVD and for MACE, were 0.70 and 0.77, respectively, and for the final models, including all significant risk factors, were 0.75 and 0.82.

We observed, for the first time, significant inverse correlations between systolic blood pressure (BP) and erythrocyte catalase activity and between diastolic BP and erythrocyte catalase activity. Plasma total and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol as well as triglyceride levels were similar between baseline and 1-, 3-, and 6-month treatment values in the same patients; however, systolic and diastolic BP levels were expectedly reduced after the therapy. Thus, there was no association between BP and lipid-cholesterol metabolism.

Here we showed that deletion of ACE2 aggravates liver steatosis, which is correlated with the increased expression of hepatic lipogenic genes and the decreased expression of fatty acid oxidation-related genes in the liver of ACE2 knockout (ACE2(-/y)) mice. Meanwhile, oxidative stress and inflammation were also aggravated in ACE2(-/y) mice. On the contrary, overexpression of ACE2 improved fatty liver in db/db mice, and the mRNA levels of fatty acid oxidation-related genes were up-regulated. In vitro, Ang-(1-7)/ACE2 ameliorated hepatic steatosis, oxidative stress and inflammation in free fatty acid (FFA)-induced HepG2 cells, and what's more, Akt inhibitors reduced ACE2-mediated lipid metabolism. Furthermore, ACE2-mediated Akt activation could be attenuated by blockade of ATP/P2 receptor/Calmodulin (CaM) pathway. These results indicated that Ang-(1-7)/ACE2/Mas axis may reduce liver lipid accumulation partly by regulating lipid-metabolizing genes through ATP/P2 receptor/CaM signaling pathway. Our findings support the potential role of ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis in prevention and treatment of hepatic lipid metabolism.",

The Practice Innovation And Clinical Excellence (PINNACLE) India Quality Improvement Program (PIQIP) is a registry for cardiovascular quality improvement in India supported by the American College of Cardiology Foundation. Between January 2008 and September 2014, we evaluated documentation of use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs)/angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and \u03b2-blockers, or both, among outpatients with HFrEF seeking care in 10 centers enrolled in the PIQIP registry. Among 75 639 patients in the PIQIP registry, 34 995 had EF reported, and 15 870 had an EF \u226440%. The mean age was 56 years; 23% were female.

    "724": "Blood pressure (BP) monitoring devices are very commonly used by the general public for self-measurement. Approximately 19% of people using these devises check their BP every day or almost every day and only one third use them because their doctor recommended it. Measurement often causes anxiety and anxiety increases blood pressure in the short term. Elderly patients often visit the emergency room (ER) due to these BP elevations. Almost 10% of patients presenting to ERs complained of high BP, and between 50-75% of them receive antihypertensive drugs (sometimes with serious adverse effects) despite the fact that only 7.5% are classified as hypertensive emergencies, and only 2.8% are at risk of serious outcome. Two studies suggested the use of anxiolitics in the treatment of excessive hypertension. When compared to captopril, treatment with diazepam or alprazolam showed to be effective in lowering BP, with no significant difference between the two groups. We therefore suggest that patients with acute elevations of BP (measured at home) try an anxiolytic before deciding to go to the ER. Patients in which BP lowers with the use of tranquilizers do not need to go to the ER. We also suggest using this strategy in patients visiting community clinics and ER for the same reason. Our hypothesis is that by using our suggestions there will be a significant reduction in the number of unnecessary visits to the ER, the use of medication that may produce serious adverse effects, and an important health cost reduction, without increasing the risk for patients (a 10% reduction of ER visits may save up to 300 million dollars/year in the US alone and prevent unnecessary use of medical facilities and manpower).",

Thus, guidelines mandate their use in such patients. Conversely, combinations of RAAS blocking agents in these patients can worsen renal outcomes. Moreover, use of RAAS blockers in patients with a glomerular filtration rate below 45 mL/min/1.73 m(2) is limited by hyperkalemia. New agents that predictably bind excess potassium in the colon offer the possibility of extending RAAS inhibitor use in advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) to allow evaluation of RAAS blockade for nephropathy and cardiovascular outcomes. These new potassium-binding agents may provide an opportunity to continue full-dose RAAS inhibition and assess if the benefits of RAAS blockade seen in stage 3 CKD can be extrapolated to persons with stages 4 and 5 CKD, not previously tested due to hyperkalemia.",

Differences in the amino acid sequence of rat and human ANG-(1-12) render the human angiotensinogen (hAGT) protein refractory to cleavage by renin. We used transgenic rats harboring the hAGT gene [TGR(hAGT)L1623] to assess the non-renin-dependent effects of increased hAGT expression on heart function and arterial pressure. Compared with Sprague-Dawley (SD) control rats (n= 11), male homozygous TGR(hAGT)L1623 (n= 9) demonstrated sustained daytime and nighttime hypertension associated with no changes in heart rate but increased heart rate lability. Increased heart weight/tibial length ratio and echocardiographic indexes of cardiac hypertrophy were associated with modest reduction of systolic function in hAGT rats. Robust human ANG-(1-12) immunofluorescence within myocytes of TGR(hAGT)L1623 rats was associated with a fourfold increase in cardiac ANG II content. Chymase enzymatic activity, using the rat or human ANG-(1-12) as a substrate, was not different in the cardiac tissue of SD and hAGT rats. Since both cardiac angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and ACE2 activities were not different among the two strains, the changes in cardiac structure and function, blood pressure, and left ventricular ANG II content might be a product of an increased cardiac expression of ANG II generated through a non-renin-dependent mechanism. The data also underscore the existence in the rat of alternate enzymes capable of acting on hAGT protein. Homozygous transgenic rats expressing the hAGT gene represent a novel tool to investigate the contribution of human relevant renin-independent cardiac ANG II formation and function.",

In the large, randomized, double-blind, PARADIGM-HF trial, sacubitril/valsartan reduced the incidence of death from cardiovascular causes or first hospitalization for worsening heart failure (composite primary endpoint) significantly more than the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril. Sacubitril/valsartan was also superior to enalapril in reducing death from any cause and in limiting the progression of heart failure. Sacubitril/valsartan was generally well tolerated, with no increase in life-threatening adverse events. Symptomatic hypotension was significantly more common with sacubitril/valsartan than with enalapril; the incidence of angio-oedema was low.

Valsartan counterbalances the increase of angiotensin II that results from neprilysin inhibition, exerting also the beneficial effects of angiotensin receptor blockers seen in previous HF trials. PARADIGM-HF trial has proved the superiority of sacubitril/valsartan (LCZ696) over ACE inhibitor enalapril to reduce mortality and morbidity of symptomatic HF patients with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), setting the grounds for the replacement of ACE inhibitors by sacubitril/valsartan in the management of HFrEF.

The endpoints were all-cause mortality and cardiac mortality.There are 3002 patients according to the inclusion criteria and follow-up requirement. The mean follow-up time was 29.1\u200a\u00b1\u200a12.5 months. CAD patients with worse renal function included more cardiovascular risk factors (advanced age, history of hypertension or diabetes, and diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction).

The prescription of evidence-based medicines (EBMs) at discharge (antiplatelet agents, beta-blockers, statins, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [ACEIs] or angiotensin-receptor blockers [ARBs]) was a factor in reducing the risk of all-cause death and cardiovascular death. However, EBMs prescribed at discharge revealed an obvious underuse in renal insufficiency (RI) patients. The results of Cox regression showed that irrespective of the eGFR level, greater use of EBMs resulted in a greater reduction in the risk of all-cause death and cardiovascular death.A higher percentage of patients with CAD and concomitant RI suffered from cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, whereas a lower percentage of these patients used EBMs to prevent CVD events. Strict use of EBMs, including beta-blockers, statins, and ACEIs or ARBs, can lead to more clinical benefits, even for patients with CAD and concomitant RI.

Epidemiological studies have shown that TCM is more common in postmenopausal women; however exact figures are not available. The underlying aetiology is still largely undetermined. Elevated catecholamine levels, lack of estrogen, disturbed myocardial fatty acid metabolism and plaque rupture with spontaneous thrombolysis are potentially discussed mechanisms responsible for inducing a prolonged stunned myocardium. Strong emotional or physical stress is the most frequently described trigger in the literature. Therapy recommendations include appropriate antiplatelet treatment, \u03b2-blockers and ACE inhibitors.

Group II and IV are treated with ramipril for 14 d. At the end of treatment, the livers were removed, and the level of hepatic marker enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase, Alanine aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase), nitric oxide, advanced protein oxidation product , catalase activity, and lipid peroxidation were determined. The degree of fibrosis was evaluated through histopathological staining with Sirius red and trichrome milligan staining. Carbon-tetrachloride (CCl4) administration in rats developed hepatic dysfunction and raised the hepatic marker enzymes activities significantly. CCl4 administration in rats also produced oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis in liver. Furthermore, angiotensinogen-inhibitor ramipril normalized the hepatic enzymes activities and improved the antioxidant enzyme catalase activity. Moreover, ramipril treatment ameliorated lipid peroxidation and hepatic inflammation in CCl4-treated rats. Ramipril treatment also significantly reduced hepatic fibrosis in CCl4-administered rats. In conclusion, our investigation suggests that the antifibrotic effect of ramipril may be attributed to inhibition of angiotensin-II mediated oxidative stress and inflammation in liver CCl4-administered rats.",

The proteins extracted from dulse were mainly composed of phycoerythrin (PE) followed by phycocyanin (PC) and allophycocyanin (APC). The dulse proteins showed slight ACE inhibitory activity, whereas the inhibitory activity was extremely enhanced by thermolysin hydrolysis. The ACE inhibitory activity of hydrolysates was hardly affected by additional pepsin, trypsin and chymotrypsin treatments. Nine ACE inhibitory peptides (YRD, AGGEY, VYRT, VDHY, IKGHY, LKNPG, LDY, LRY, FEQDWAS) were isolated from the hydrolysates by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and it was demonstrated that the synthetic peptide LRY (IC50: 0.044 \u03bcmol) has remarkably high ACE inhibitory activity. Then, we investigated the structural properties of dulse phycobiliproteins to discuss the origin of dulse ACE inhibitory peptides. Each dulse phycobiliprotein possesses \u03b1-subunit (Mw: 17,477-17,638) and \u03b2-subunit (Mw: 17,455-18,407). The sequences of YRD, AGGEY, VYRT, VDHY, LKNPG and LDY were detected in the primary structure of PE \u03b1-subunit, and the LDY also exists in the APC \u03b1- and \u03b2-subunits. In addition, the LRY sequence was found in the \u03b2-subunits of PE, PC and APC. From these results, it was suggested that the dulse ACE inhibitory peptides were derived from phycobiliproteins, especially PE. To make sure the deduction, we carried out additional experiment by using recombinant PE. We expressed the recombinant \u03b1- and \u03b2-subunits of PE (rPE\u03b1 and rPE\u03b2, respectively), and then prepared their peptides by thermolysin hydrolysis. As a result, these peptides showed high ACE inhibitory activities (rPE\u03b1: 94.4%; rPE\u03b2: 87.0%).

We conducted a retrospective cohort study on patients admitted to Staten Island University Hospital for the diagnosis of MI between January 2005 and December 2012.

Many observations have reported discrimination of care for patients with CKD considered suboptimal candidates for aggressive management of their cardiac disease. In our study, medical therapy was achieved at high percentage and was comparable among groups of different kidney function.

Hence, the current review was aimed to investigate the effect of RAAS inhibitors in managing hypertension among hemodialysis patients in a randomized control trial. Using PUBMED and EMBASE databases, randomized control trial with primary or secondary outcomes related to the effect of RAAS inhibitors on blood pressure among hemodialysis patients were included for analysis. The current review also assessed the quality of reporting of RCT. A total of eight RCT met inclusion criteria for current review.

Assays were carried out in hu and mu mononuclear cells (MNCs) and huCD34(+) cells or mu-lineage-depleted (muLin(-)) cells, human-recombinant (rh) enzymes, and mu-heart with enzyme-specific substrates. ACE or ACE2 inhibition by racemic MLN-4760, its isomers MLN-4760-A and MLN-4760-B, DX600 and captopril were characterized. MLN-4760-B is relatively less efficacious and less-selective than the racemate or MLN-4760-A at hu-rhACE2, and all three of them inhibited 43% rhACE. In huMNCs, MLN-4760-B detected 63% ACE2 with 28-fold selectivity over ACE. In huCD34(+) cells, MLN-4760-B detected 38% of ACE2 activity with 63-fold selectivity. In mu-heart and muMNCs, isomer B was 100- and 228-fold selective for ACE2, respectively. In muLin(-) cells, MLN-4760-B detected 25% ACE2 activity with a pIC50 of 6.3. The racemic mixture and MLN-4760-A showed lower efficacy and poor selectivity for ACE2 in MNCs and mu-heart.

A computationally reliable model of NEP2 was achieved with 79.9%, 19.1% and 0.2% residues in the allowed, additionally allowed and disallowed regions respectively, using as a reference protein. Additionally, molecular docking studies were carried out for a set of five already known inhibitors of NEP and modeled NEP2 to obtain the comparative behaviors of the complexes. MD results highlighted their different responses along with important residues having a part in ligand-protein binding. For substrate and inhibitor binding, Arg664/661 and Zn697/694 were identified as the most conserved residues. High degree flexible transitions during the MD simulations were also observed in loop areas along with active site residues. Energy calculations, hydrogen bonds and their occupancy rates helped to conclude each ligand's potency towards a particular target. In most complexes of hNEP2, the ligands showed weak interactions which might be due to its larger pocket size or huge conformational variations in active site residues upon complexation. In the case of inhibitors of a small size like thiorphan, Arg49 and Arg664 are found to be acting to support the ligand binding in NEP while only Arg661 is acting in NEP2.",

Currently, we distinguish 5 types of nonallergic angioedema: hereditary angioedema (HAE) due to C1-INH deficiency, acquired angioedema (AAE), and angioedema induced by the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, all of which are mediated by bradykinin, as well as pseudoallergic angioedema and idiopathic angioedema. Bradykinin-mediated angioedema (eg, laryngeal angioedema) may be life-threatening because of resistance to corticosteroids and antihistamine drugs. C1-INH concentrates are the drugs of choice in the treatment of HAE and AAE. In recent years, some new drugs have been introduced in the treatment of bradykinin-mediated angioedema, such as bradykinin B2-receptor antagonist, icatibant, and kallikrein inhibitor, ecallantide, which allow to improve treatment outcomes.",

Blood samples were collected before and after heat exposure. Plasma cytokine levels were measured using sandwich ELISA kits. Plasma redox status was determined by thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) levels and ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP). Hypertensive subjects showed higher plasma levels of IL-10 at baseline (P<0.05), although levels of this cytokine were similar between groups after heat exposure. Moreover, after heat exposure, hypertensive individuals showed higher plasma levels of soluble TNF receptor (sTNFR1) and lower TBARS (P<0.01) and FRAP (P<0.05) levels. Controlled hypertensive subjects, who use angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (ACE inhibitors), present an anti-inflammatory status and balanced redox status. Nevertheless, exposure to a heat stress condition seems to cause an imbalance in the redox status and an unregulated inflammatory response.",

    "844": "The role of the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the pathophysiology of malignant hypertension is not fully understood. Accumulating evidence indicates that the recently discovered vasodilator axis of the RAS, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) type 2 (ACE2)/angiotensin 1-7 (ANG 1-7), constitutes an endogenous system counterbalancing the hypertensiogenic axis, ACE/angiotensin II (ANG II)/AT1 receptor. This study aimed to evaluate the role of the intrarenal vasodilator RAS axis in the pathophysiology of ANG II-dependent malignant hypertension in Cyp1a1-Ren-2 transgenic rats. ANG II-dependent malignant hypertension was induced by 13\u00a0days' dietary administration of indole-3-carbinol (I3C), a natural xenobiotic that activates the mouse renin gene in Cyp1a1-Ren-2 transgenic rats. It was hypothesized that pharmacologically-induced inhibition of the ACE2/ANG 1-7 complex should aggravate, and activation of this axis should attenuate, the course of ANG II-dependent malignant hypertension. Blood pressure (BP) was monitored by radiotelemetry. ACE2 inhibitor (DX 600, 0.2\u00a0\u03bcg/day) and ACE2 activator (DIZE, 1\u00a0mg/day) were administrated via osmotic minipumps. Even though ACE2 inhibitor significantly decreased and ACE2 activator increased intrarenal ANG 1-7 concentrations, the course of BP, as well as of albuminuria, cardiac hypertrophy and renal glomerular damage, were not altered. It was shown that intrarenal alterations in the ACE2/ANG 1-7 complex did not significantly modify the course of malignant hypertension in I3C-induced Cyp1a1-Ren-2 transgenic rats. Thus, in our experimental setting alterations of this intrarenal vasodilator complex of the RAS do not significantly modify the form of malignant hypertension that clearly depends on the inappropriately increased activity of the ACE/ANG II/AT1 receptor axis.",

For similar BP reductions, enalapril-lercanidipine (EL) caused norepinephrine and MSNA increases significantly less pronounced than those seen with enalapril-felodipine, the lesser sympathoexcitation observed with EL being coupled with a significant improvement in homeostasis model assessment index. This was the case also when L and F were uptitrated in the combination. In OHT, at variance from enalapril-felodipine, EL combination is almost entirely devoid of any major sympathoexcitatory effect and is associated with an improvement in insulin sensitivity.", 
    "859": "Cough and swallowing reflexes are important airway-protective mechanisms against aspiration. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, one of the side effects of which is cough, have been reported to reduce the incidence of aspiration pneumonia in hypertensive patients with stroke. ACE inhibitors have also been reported to improve the swallowing function in post-stroke patients. On the other hand, stimulation of the Arnold nerve, the auricular branch of the vagus, triggers the cough reflex (Arnold's ear-cough reflex). Capsaicin, an agonist of Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), has been shown to activate the peripheral sensory C-fibers. Stimulation of the sensory branches of the vagus in the laryngotracheal mucosa with capsaicin induces the cough reflex and has been reported to improve the swallowing function in patients with dysphagia. In our previous study, we showed that aural stimulation of the Arnold nerve with 0.025% capsaicin ointment improved the swallowing function, as evaluated by the endoscopic swallowing score, in 26 patients with dysphagia. In the present study, the video images of swallowing recorded in the previous study were re-evaluated using the SMRC scale by an independent otolaryngologist who was blinded to the information about the patients and the endoscopic swallowing score. The SMRC scale is used to evaluate four aspects of the swallowing function: 1) Sensory: the initiation of the swallowing reflex as assessed by the white-out timing; 2) Motion: the ability to hold blue-dyed water in the oral cavity and induce laryngeal elevation; 3) Reflex: glottal closure and the cough reflex induced by touching the epiglottis or arytenoid with the endoscope; 4) Clearance: pharyngeal clearance of the blue-dyed water after swallowing. Accordingly, we demonstrated that a single application of capsaicin ointment to the external auditory canal of patients with dysphagia significantly improved the R, but not the S, M or C scores, and this effect lasted for 60 min. After repeated aural stimulation with the ointment for 7 days, the R score improved significantly in patients with severe dysphagia. The present findings suggest that stimulation of the Arnold's branch of the vagus in the external auditory canal with capsaicin improves the glottal closure and cough reflex in patients with dysphagia. Thus, aural stimulation with capsaicin represents a novel treatment for dysphagia. It is also suggested that repeated alternative aural stimulation with capsaicin for a week, rather than a single application, is needed to improve the swallowing function in patients with severe dysphagia. By the same mechanism as that underlying the effect of ACE inhibitors, aural stimulation with capsaicin may reduce the incidence of aspiration pneumonia in patients with dysphagia.", 
    "860": "Hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a maladaptive response to chronic pressure overload and a strong independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Regression of LVH is associated with improved prognosis. Regression of LVH with antihypertensive therapy (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and diuretics) has been reported, although only after long-term treatment. Asymmetrical dimethylarginine (ADMA), the most potent endogenous NO synthase inhibitor, is emerging as an important cardiovascular risk factor in patients with arterial hypertension and LVH, and dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH) is the mechanism that most frequently leads to accumulation of ADMA (plasma ADMA is cleared in small part by renal excretion, although the bulk of ADMA is degraded by DDAH). Left ventricular mass is strongly modulated by the NO system. As an important inhibitor of the bioavailability of NO, ADMA is an underlying mechanism of LVH. Beta-blockers can induce regression of LVH and reduced plasma ADMA levels. Oxidative stress is increased in patients with LVH, and this in turn increases generation of ADMA. In a previous preclinical study of spontaneously hypertensive rats, we found that short-term treatment (48 h) with esmolol reverses early LVH, increases the bioavailability of NO, and improves antioxidant status in plasma. Therefore, we propose that the ADMA/DDAH/NO pathway could modulate early regression of LVH with esmolol.",

For 1998 and 2008-2011 in Germany, the gender gap in hypertension management persisted without significant changes. Hypertensive men in 2008-2011 had lower awareness of their condition (78.3 vs. 86.8%), less treatment for hypertension (65.3 vs. 79.2%), less control of hypertension (45.4 vs. 57.5%) and less treatment among those aware of their condition (83.9 vs. 91.5%) than did women. These gender differences were greater in younger compared with older adults (18-54 years vs. 55-79 years). No gender differences were observed in control of hypertension among those treated in 1998; however, subsequent improvement was less in younger men compared with the other age-gender groups, leading to a new gender gap in 18-54-year olds (women 84.8%, men 63.9%). Younger women used more \u03b2-blockers and less angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) than younger men. Factors positively associated with control among those treated for hypertension in the younger group were being a woman, using \u03b2-blockers or using ACEI, or angiotensin-receptor blockers. In the older group, diabetes was negatively associated with control of hypertension, whereas having cardiovascular comorbidities was positively associated. Gender disparities in hypertension management and control still exist in Germany but may be masked because they are age-dependent.",

Patients with unavailable BMI data or BMI <18.5\u2009kg/m(2) were excluded. Clinical data and in-hospital mortality were compared among the following BMI categories: 18.5-24.9\u2009kg/m(2) (normal weight), 25-29.9\u2009kg/m(2) (overweight) and \u226530\u2009kg/m(2) (obese).",

A 48-year-old man presented with acute onset altered sensorium, vomiting, and gasping. On admission, he was unresponsive and hemodynamically unstable. He was intubated and ventilated and resuscitated with fluids and inotropes. The biochemical evaluation revealed hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and hypocortisolism. Hyponatremia was corrected with 3% hypertonic saline. Contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain revealed a sellar-suprasellar mass with hypothalamic extension with no evidence of pituitary apoplexy. A diagnosis of invasive pituitary adenoma with the Addisonian crisis was made and steroid replacement was initiated. Despite volume resuscitation, he had persistent refractory hypotension, recurrent ventricular tachycardia, and metabolic acidosis. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST elevation and T-wave inversion in lateral leads; cardiac-enzymes were increased suggestive of acute coronary syndrome. Transthoracic echocardiography showed severe regional wall motion abnormalities (RWMAs) involving left anterior descending territory and low ejection fraction (EF). Coronary angiogram revealed normal coronaries, apical ballooning, and severe left ventricular dysfunction, consistent with a diagnosis of Takotsubo's cardiomyopathy. Patient was managed with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and B-blockers. He improved over few days and recovered completely. At discharge, ECG changes and RWMA resolved and EF normalized to 56%. In patients with Addisonian Crisis with persistent hypotension refractory to optimal resuscitation, possibility of Takotsubo's cardiomyopathy should be considered. Early recognition of association of Takotsubos cardiomyopathy in neurological conditions, prompt resuscitation, and supportive care are essential to ensure favorable outcomes in this potentially lethal condition.",

    "901": "We included seven RCTs with a total of 571 participants in the review. Two of the seven trials involved 36 participants undergoing non-cardiac vascular surgery (infrarenal aortic surgery), and five involved 535 participants undergoing cardiac surgery, including valvular surgery, coronary artery bypass surgery, and cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. The intervention was started from 11 days to 25 minutes before surgery in six trials and during surgery in one trial. We considered all seven RCTs to carry a high risk of bias. The effects of ACEIs or ARBs on perioperative mortality and acute myocardial infarction were uncertain because the quality of the evidence was very low. The risk of death was 2.7% in the ACEIs or ARBs group and 1.6% in the placebo group (risk ratio (RR) 1.61; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 5.85). The risk of acute myocardial infarction was 1.7% in the ACEIs or ARBs group and 3.0% in the placebo group (RR 0.55; 95% CI 0.14 to 2.26). ACEIs or ARBs may improve congestive heart failure (cardiac index) perioperatively (mean difference (MD) -0.60; 95% CI -0.70 to -0.50, very low-quality evidence). In terms of rate of complications, there was no difference in perioperative cerebrovascular complications (RR 0.48; 95% CI 0.18 to 1.28, very low-quality evidence) and hypotension (RR 1.95; 95% CI 0.86 to 4.41, very low-quality evidence). Cardiac surgery-related renal failure was not reported. ACEIs or ARBs were associated with shortened length of hospital stay (MD -0.54; 95% CI -0.93 to -0.16, P value = 0.005, very low-quality evidence). These findings should be interpreted cautiously due to likely confounding by the clinical backgrounds of the participants. ACEIs or ARBs may shorten the length of hospital stay, (MD -0.54; 95% CI -0.93 to -0.16, very low-quality evidence) Two studies reported adverse events, and there was no evidence of a difference between the ACEIs or ARBs and control groups.", 
    "902": "Overall, this review did not find evidence to support that perioperative ACEIs or ARBs can prevent mortality, morbidity, and complications (hypotension, perioperative cerebrovascular complications, and cardiac surgery-related renal failure). We found no evidence showing that the use of these drugs may reduce the rate of acute myocardial infarction. However, ACEIs or ARBs may increase cardiac output perioperatively. Due to the low and very low methodology quality, high risk of bias, and lack of power of the included studies, the true effect may be substantially different from the observed estimates. Perioperative (mainly elective cardiac surgery, according to included studies) initiation of ACEIs or ARBs therapy should be individualized.",

The prescription rates of beta-blockers at discharge at HCG and HCP were both 69% (p = 0.458), whereas those of ACEI/ARB were 83% and 86%, respectively (p = 0.162).

Pharmaceuticals are constantly released into aquatic environments, mainly due to their widespread consumption and complicated removal in wastewater treatment plants. Heterogeneous photocatalysis appear to be one of the most destructive advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) for organic contaminants and are possible to obtain complete mineralization of organic pollutants into eco-friendly end products under visible and solar light irradiation. In this study, flower-like In2S3 hierarchical nanostructures were successfully prepared via a facile solution-phase route, using thioacetamide as both sulfur source and capping agent. X-ray diffractometry (XRD) of the flowers revealed that the cubic structure of In2S3; morphological studies examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed the synthesized In2S3 nanostructure was flower-like hierarchitecture assembled from nanoscale flakes. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis confirmed the stoichiometry of In2S3 nanoflowers. Furthermore, the photocatalytic activity studies revealed that the prepared indium(III) sulfide(In2S3) nanoflowers exhibit an excellent photocatalytic performance, degrading rapidly the aqueous pharmaceutical solution of Lisinopril under visible light irradiation. These results suggest that In2S3 nanoflowers will be a promising candidate of photocatalyst working in thevisible light range.",

In patients with reduced EF, renal insufficiency accompanies the higher risks of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality.

If serum creatinine is normal in early pregnancy, kidney function is often preserved during pregnancy, but complications such as severe preeclampsia and preterm delivery are still common. Perinatal mortality is now comparable with that in women with diabetes and normal kidney function. Besides strict glycaemic control before and during pregnancy, early and intensive antihypertensive treatment is important to optimize pregnancy outcomes. Methyldopa, labetalol, nifedipine and diltiazem are considered safe, whereas angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers should be stopped before or at confirmation of pregnancy. Supplementation with folic acid in early pregnancy and low-dose aspirin from 10 to 12 weeks reduces the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. During breastfeeding, several ACE inhibitors are considered safe.",

This research used synchrotron radiation-based Fourier transform infrared (SR-FTIR) microspectroscopy and imaging to investigate the hydration induced material transfer in the membranes of osmotic pump tablets. SR-FTIR was applied to record and map the chemical information of a micro-region of the membranes, composed of cellulose acetate (CA, as the water insoluble matrix) and polyethylene glycol (PEG, as the soluble pore forming agent and plasticizing agent). The microstructure and chemical change of membranes hydrated for 0, 5, 10 and 30min were measured using SR-FTIR, combined with scanning electronic microscopy and atom force microscopy. The SR-FTIR microspectroscopy results indicated that there was a major change at the absorption range of 2700-3100cm(-1) in the membranes after different periods of hydration time. The absorption bands at 2870-2880cm(-1) and 2950-2960cm(-1) were assigned to represent CA and PEG, respectively. The chemical group signal distribution illustrated by the ratio of PEG to CA demonstrated that the trigger of drug release in the preliminary stage was due to the rapid transfer of PEG into liquid medium with a sharp decrease of PEG in the membranes. The SR-FTIR mapping results have demonstrated the hydration induced material transfer in the membranes of osmotic pump tablets and enabled reassessment of the drug release mechanism of membrane controlled osmotic pump systems.",

However, a significant proportion of MDD patients continue to experience significant cognitive impairment. Two multicenter randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reported that vortioxetine, a multimodal antidepressant, has significant precognitive effects in MDD unrelated to mood improvement. Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate was shown to alleviate executive dysfunction in an RCT of adults after full or partial remission of MDD. Preliminary evidence also indicates that erythropoietin may alleviate cognitive dysfunction in MDD. Several other novel agents may be repurposed as cognitive enhancers for MDD treatment, including minocycline, insulin, antidiabetic agents, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, S-adenosyl methionine, acetyl-L-carnitine, alpha lipoic acid, omega-3 fatty acids, melatonin, modafinil, galantamine, scopolamine, N-acetylcysteine, curcumin, statins, and coenzyme Q10.

Protein hydrolysate was found to strongly inhibit the angiotensin I converting enzyme and exhibited high antioxidative activity through 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl free radical scavenging assay. After ultrafiltration, peptides were isolated by a two-step procedure: size exclusion chromatography on a Toyopearl HW-40 followed by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with a high purification yield of 2.5 mg of peptide per gram of initial protein. Two major peptides were then identified by nanoscale liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (nano-LC-MS/MS), corresponding to the following sequences: Leu-Val-Thr-Gly-Asp-Asp-Lys-Thr-Asn-Leu-Lys (1,204.665 Da) and Asp-Thr-Gly-Ser-Asp-Lys-Lys-Gln-Leu (992.511 Da). These peptides, mainly composed of hydrophilic amino acids, showed high antioxidative and angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitory activities.

The RAS can be delineated into a classical RAS (the pressor arm) including angiotensinogen (Agt), renin, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), angiotensin II (Ang II) and angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R), and a counterbalancing novel RAS (the depressor arm) including Agt, renin, angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), angiotensin-(1-7) (Ang 1-7) and Ang 1-7 receptor (or Mas receptor (MasR)). Hyperglycemia (diabetes) induces severe tissue oxidative stress, which stimulates the pressor arm of the renal RAS axis and leads to an increase in ACE/ACE-2 ratio, with excessive formation of Ang II. There is a growing body of evidence for beneficial effects of the depressor arm of RAS (ACE-2/Ang 1-7/MasR) axis in diabetes, hypertension and several other diseased conditions. Evidence from in vitro, in vivo and clinical studies reflects anti-oxidant, anti-fibrotic, and anti-inflammatory properties of Ang 1-7. Most of the currently available therapies only target suppression of the pressor arm of RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and ACE inhibitors (ACEi). However, it is time to consider simultaneous activation of the depressor arm for more effective outcomes. This review summarizes the recent updates on the protective role of Ang 1-7 in hypertension and kidney injury in diabetes, as well as the possible underlying mechanism(s) of Ang 1-7 action, suggesting that the ACE-2/Ang 1-7/MasR axis can be developed as a therapeutic target for the treatment of diabetes-induced hypertension and renal damage.", 
    "960": "We reported evidence of bradykinin (BK) regeneration from C-terminal extended BK sequences that behave as peptidase-activated B2 receptor (B2R) agonists. Further to these in vitro studies, we carried out in vivo experiments to verify hemodynamic effects of BK analogs exhibiting variable susceptibility toward vascular and blood plasma peptidases. Rats were anesthetized and instrumented to record blood pressure and heart rate responses to bolus intravenous (i.v.) injection of increasing doses of BK, B-9972 (D-Arg-[Hyp(3),Igl(5),Oic(7),Igl(8)]-BK), BK-Arg, BK-His-Leu or BK-Ala-Pro, in the absence or presence of specific inhibitors. In some experiments, pulsed Doppler flow probes measured hindquarter Doppler shift in response to i.v. injections of kinins. BK caused rapid, transient and dose-related hypotensive effects. These effects were potentiated \u223c15-fold by the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, enalaprilat, but extensively inhibited by icatibant (a B2R antagonist) and not influenced by the Arg-carboxypeptidase (CP) inhibitor (Plummer's inhibitor). The hypotensive responses elicited by the peptidase-resistant B2R agonist, B-9972, were not affected by enalaprilat, but were inhibited by icatibant. The hypotensive responses to BK-Arg were abolished by pre-treatment with either the Arg-CP inhibitor or icatibant, pharmacologically evidencing BK regeneration. The hypotensive effects of BK-His-Leu and BK-Ala-Pro, previously reported as ACE-activated substrates, were abolished by icatibant, but not by enalaprilat. In vivo regeneration of BK from these two C-terminally extended analogs with no affinity for the B2R must follow alternative cleavage rules involving unidentified carboxypeptidase(s) when ACE is blocked. The transient hypotensive responses to BK and three tested analogs coincided with concomitant vasodilation (increased Doppler shift signal).

Pharmacological treatment is the commonest intervention and has been shown to reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, and total mortality. Accordingly, the type and number of antihypertensives used and the outcome - in terms of blood pressure (BP) control - are important. Therefore, our purpose is to learn the pattern of antihypertensive drug prescription and explore the determinants of BP control in an urban population in Mexico. A retrospective cross-sectional drug utilization study was conducted. Medical records from a community health centre were searched to identify those corresponding to patients diagnosed with hypertension; information upon antihypertensives used and control of the disease was carefully retrieved. A logistic regression model was built to know the main determinants of BP control. A sample of 345 clinical records of interest was identified. Most patients received antihypertensives (86.4%); the leading medications used were angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, 63.8%; beta-blockers (26.5%), diuretics (19.8%), angiotensin-receptor blockers (15.8%) and calcium-channel blockers (6.4%). Only the age (\u226555 years) and BMI (>30) of the patients, and the age of the doctors (\u226555 years), had an important influence on BP control. Obesity is a particular and important determinant of uncontrolled hypertension; it is worth to act on body weight, on an individual basis. As lack of control has been also tied to elderly doctors, an education programme could be envisaged.",

The prevalence of COPD among HFrEF patients ranges from 20 to 32\u00a0%. On the other hand; HFrEF is prevalent in more than 20\u00a0% of COPD patients. With an aging population, the number of patients with coexisting COPD and HFrEF is on rise. Coexisting COPD and HFrEF presents a unique diagnostic and therapeutic clinical conundrum. Common symptoms shared by both conditions mask the early referral and detection of the other. Beta blockers (BB), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and aldosterone antagonists have been shown to reduce hospitalizations, morbidity, and mortality in HFrEF while long-acting inhaled bronchodilators (beta-2-agonists and anticholinergics) and corticosteroids have been endorsed for COPD treatment. The opposing pharmacotherapy of BBs and beta-2-agonists highlight the conflict in prescribing BBs in COPD and beta-2-agonists in HFrEF. This has resulted in underutilization of evidence-based therapy for HFrEF in COPD patients owing to fear of adverse effects. This review aims to provide an update and current perspective on diagnostic and therapeutic management of patients with coexisting COPD and HFrEF.",

Second, heart failure and stroke reductions were significantly related to SBP, DBP and pulse pressure reductions. Third, in 18 BP-lowering RCTs excluding baseline heart failure from recruitment, heart failure reduction ('new-onset' heart failure) [RR 0.58 (0.44-0.75)] was very similar to that in the entire set of RCTs. Fourth, in meta-analyses of head-to-head comparisons of different antihypertensive classes, calcium antagonists were inferior in preventing 'new-onset' heart failure [RR 1.16 (1.01-1.33)].

A meta-analysis in 20,451 hypertensive patients from eight randomized controlled trials was conducted to compare the A+C treatment with other combination therapies in terms of blood pressure (BP) reduction, clinical outcomes, and adverse events. The results showed that BP reduction did not differ significantly among the A+C therapy and other combination therapies in systolic and diastolic BP (P=.87 and P=.56, respectively). However, A+C therapy, compared with other combination therapies, achieved a significantly lower incidence of cardiovascular composite endpoints, including cardiovascular mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke (risk ratio [RR], 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.70-0.91; P<.001), but similar all-cause mortality (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.77-1.04; P=.15) and stroke rates (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.77-1.04; P=.09). Moreover, A+C therapy yielded a 4.21 mL/min/1.73 m(2) lower estimated glomerular filtration rate reduction than other combinations (P<.001). Finally, A+C therapy showed a similar incidence of adverse events as other combination therapies (P=.34) but presented a significantly lower incidence of serious adverse events (RR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.73-0.98; P=.03). In conclusion, A+C therapy is superior to other combinations of antihypertensive treatment as it shows a lower incidence of cardiovascular events and adverse events, while it has similar effects in lowering BP and preserving renal function.",

The kinetic parameters, a and b, were determined according to experimental data. It was found that the model was reliable to describe the kinetic behaviour for SSGP hydrolysis by alcalase. After hydrolysis, the SSGP hydrolysate with DH of 19% exhibited the strongest ACE inhibitory activity and the hydrolysate was then used to isolate ACE inhibitory peptides. A novel ACE inhibitory peptide was successfully purified from this hydrolysate by ultrafiltration, ion exchange chromatography, gel filtration chromatography, and reversed-phased high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). The amino acid sequence of the purified peptide was identified as Thr-Leu-Ser (IC50=102.1 \u03bcM). The molecular docking studies revealed that the ACE inhibition of the tripeptide was mainly attributed to its C-terminal Ser, which can effectively interact with the S1 and S2 pockets of ACE.

The present study was designed to investigate the effect of Ang II on ICC survival in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice. Western blot, immunofluorescence, isometric muscle recording, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a cell counting kit-8 were used in this research. Our results demonstrate that the c-Kit and membrane-bound stem cell factor (mSCF) protein expression levels in gastric smooth muscle were decreased in STZ-induced diabetic mice. However, the angiotensin receptor type 1 (AT1R) expression levels in gastric smooth muscle and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) expression levels in gastric mucosa were increased. The effect of Ang II on the tonic contraction of gastric smooth muscle was potentiated in diabetic mice, and the plasma Ang II level was enhanced. Ang II increased mSCF expression, cell proliferation, and Akt-Ser473 phosphorylation in cultured gastric smooth muscle cells (GSMCs). These effects were reduced by specific inhibitors ZD7155 (an AT1R antagonist) and LY294002 (a PI3-kinase inhibitor). Our results suggest that Ang II increases mSCF expression and cell proliferation in cultured GSMCs in a PI3K/Akt signaling-dependent manner.

At 12 weeks after TBI, the rats had higher systolic blood pressure and impaired renal afferent arteriolar function compared with control, and EET-A or captopril mitigated these abnormalities. The TBI rats had 3-fold higher blood urea nitrogen (BUN) compared with control, and EET-A or captopril decreased BUN by 40-60%.

In TBI rats, nephrinuria was elevated 30-fold and EET-A or captopril decreased it by 50-90%. Renal interstitial fibrosis, tubular and glomerular injury were present in the TBI rats, and each was decreased by EET-A or captopril. We further demonstrated elevated renal parenchymal apoptosis in TBI rats, which was mitigated by EET-A or captopril. Additional studies revealed that captopril or EET-A mitigated renal apoptosis by acting on the p53/Fas/FasL (Fas ligand) apoptotic pathway.

The main efficacy assessment was at 8 weeks.",

    "1026": "As our knowledge expands, it is now clear that the renin-angiotensin (Ang) system (RAS) mediates functions other than regulating blood pressure (BP). The RAS plays a central role in the pathophysiology of different neurovascular unit disorders including stroke and retinopathy. Moreover, the beneficial actions of RAS modulation in brain and retina have been documented in experimental research, but not yet exploited clinically. The RAS is a complex system with distinct yet interconnected components. Understanding the different RAS components and their functions under brain and retinal pathological conditions is crucial to reap their benefits. The aim of the present review is to provide an experimental and clinical update on the role of RAS in the pathophysiology and treatment of stroke and retinopathy. Combining the evidence from both these disorders allows a unique opportunity to move both fields forward.", 
    "1027": "Over-activation of the brain renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been implicated in the etiology of anxiety disorders. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) inhibits RAS activity by converting angiotensin-II, the effector peptide of RAS, to angiotensin-(1-7), which activates the Mas receptor (MasR). Whether increasing brain ACE2 activity reduces anxiety by stimulating central MasR is unknown. To test the hypothesis that increasing brain ACE2 activity reduces anxiety-like behavior via central MasR stimulation, we generated male mice overexpressing ACE2 (ACE2 KI mice) and wild type littermate controls (WT). ACE2 KI mice explored the open arms of the elevated plus maze (EPM) significantly more than WT, suggesting increasing ACE2 activity is anxiolytic. Central delivery of diminazene aceturate, an ACE2 activator, to C57BL/6 mice also reduced anxiety-like behavior in the EPM, but centrally administering ACE2 KI mice A-779, a MasR antagonist, abolished their anxiolytic phenotype, suggesting that ACE2 reduces anxiety-like behavior by activating central MasR. To identify the brain circuits mediating these effects, we measured Fos, a marker of neuronal activation, subsequent to EPM exposure and found that ACE2 KI mice had decreased Fos in the bed nucleus of stria terminalis but had increased Fos in the basolateral amygdala (BLA). Within the BLA, we determined that \u223c62% of GABAergic neurons contained MasR mRNA and expression of MasR mRNA was upregulated by ACE2 overexpression, suggesting that ACE2 may influence GABA neurotransmission within the BLA via MasR activation. Indeed, ACE2 overexpression was associated with increased frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (indicative of presynaptic release of GABA) onto BLA pyramidal neurons and central infusion of A-779 eliminated this effect. Collectively, these results suggest that ACE2 may reduce anxiety-like behavior by activating central MasR that facilitate GABA release onto pyramidal neurons within the BLA.", 
    "1028": "Selective vagal nerve stimulation (sVNS) has been demonstrated to lower blood pressure (BP) in rats without causing major side effects. This method might be adapted for the treatment of therapy-resistant hypertension in patients. Converting enzyme inhibitors (CEIs) are among the first drugs that are administered for arterial hypertension and prominently reduce BP primarily by interacting with the renin-angiotensin system of the kidneys. Beyond the reduction of BP, CEI have a positive effect on the survival rate after myocardial infarction; they reduce the rates of stroke and improve the neurohormonal status in heart-failure patients. If sVNS might be introduced as a therapy against resistant hypertension, patients will at least partially stay on their CEI medication. It is therefore the aim of this study to investigate the influence of the CEI enalapril on the haemodynamic and respiratory effects of sVNS. In 10 male Wistar rats, a polyimide-based multichannel-cuff-electrode was placed around the vagal nerve bundle to selectively stimulate the aortic depressor nerve fibres. Stimulation parameters were adapted to the thresholds of the individual animals and included repetition frequencies between 30 and 50 Hz, amplitudes of 0.5 to 1.5 mA and pulse widths between 0.4 ms and 1.0 ms. BP responses were detected with a microtip transducer in the left carotid artery, and electrocardiography was recorded with subcutaneous electrodes. After intravenous administration of enalapril (2 mg/kg bodyweight), the animals' mean arterial blood pressures (MAPs) decreased significantly, while the heart rates (HRs) were not significantly influenced. The effects of sVNS on BP and HR were attenuated by enalapril but were still present. We conclude that sVNS can lower the MAP during enalapril treatment without relevant side effects.", 
    "1029": "Hypertension is a frequent comorbidity often following the development of diabetic nephropathy among individuals with type 1 diabetes and affecting most patients with type 2 diabetes at the time of diagnosis. Multiple prospective randomized placebo-controlled trials demonstrate that tight blood pressure control among patients with diabetic nephropathy reduces the rates of macrovascular and microvascular complications. While randomized trials exist and support a blood pressure goal of <140/90 mm Hg for patients with nondiabetic kidney disease, there are no prospective data regarding a specific blood pressure goal on progression of diabetic nephropathy. Retrospective data analyses from trials show a linear relationship between either baseline or achieved study blood pressure and progression of nephropathy. Very high albuminuria is a hallmark of diabetic nephropathy with reductions by either angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) monotherapy associated with slowed nephropathy progression. However, combination antihypertensive therapy, while decreasing proteinuria, augments the risk of hyperkalemia, hypotension, and kidney dysfunction. Given the lack of trial data for a BP goal among patients with diabetic nephropathy, prospective trials are needed to define the optimal blood pressure necessary to preserve kidney function. At present, guideline blood pressure goals of less than 140/90 mm Hg and the use of ACEi or ARB therapy for those with more than 300 mg of albuminuria are mandated.",

Electrocardiogram was suggestive for old myocardial infarction. Coronarography revealed an occlusion of a diagonal branch. Computed Tomography scan was performed to exclude a rupturing aortic aneurysm, but a large pericardial effusion was seen. Echocardiography confirmed the diagnosis of cardiac tamponade and pericardiocentesis was performed. Conservative treatment consisting of bed rest, blood pressure control and beta-blocker therapy was applied, allowing the patient to be discharged after 10 days. The diagnosis of LVFWR was confirmed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging.Surgery is considered as the golden standard in treatment of LVFWR.

Sensitivity analyses restricted to trials published after 2000 revealed similar outcomes with ACEis vs placebo and ARBs vs placebo (Pinteraction>.05).

    "1049": "Resveratrol undergoes extensive metabolism to form biologically active glucuronides in humans. However, the transport mechanisms for resveratrol glucuronides are not fully established. Here, we aimed to characterize the efflux transport of resveratrol glucuronides using UGT1A1-overexpressing HeLa cells (HeLa1A1 cells), and to determine the contribution of multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) 4 to cellular excretion of the glucuronides. Two glucuronide isomers [i.e., resveratrol 3-O-glucuronide (R3G) and resveratrol 4'-O-glucuronide (R4'G)] were excreted into the extracellular compartment after incubation of resveratrol (1-100 \u03bcM) with HeLa1A1 cells. The excretion rate was linearly related to the level of intracellular glucuronide, indicating that glucuronide efflux was a nonsaturable process. MK-571 (a dual inhibitor of UGT1A1 and MRPs) significantly decreased the excretion rates of R3G and R4'G while increasing their intracellular levels. Likewise, short-hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated silencing of MRP4 caused a significant reduction in glucuronide excretion but an elevation in glucuronide accumulation. Furthermore, \u03b2-glucuronidase expressed in the cells catalyzed the hydrolysis of the glucuronides back to the parent compound. A cellular pharmacokinetic model integrating resveratrol transport/metabolism with glucuronide hydrolysis/excretion was well fitted to the experimental data, allowing derivation of the efflux rate constant values in the absence or presence of shRNA targeting MRP4. It was found that a large percentage of glucuronide excretion (43%-46%) was attributed to MRP4. In conclusion, MRP4 participated in cellular excretion of R3G and R4'G. Integration of mechanistic pharmacokinetic modeling with transporter knockdown was a useful method to derive the contribution percentage of an exporter to overall glucuronide excretion.",

The hazard ratio for patients with undiagnosed diabetes mellitus (HbA1c, > 6.5%) and known diabetes mellitus compared with those with HbA1c < 6.0% was 1.39 (1.17-1.64); P < 0.001 and 1.64 (1.43-1.87); P < 0.001, respectively. Patients with pre-diabetes mellitus were also at higher risk (hazard ratio, 1.27 [1.10-1.47]; P < 0.001) compared with those with HbA1c < 6.0%.

The primary and secondary end points were all-cause mortality and HF readmission, respectively. In total, 86 deaths and 240 HF readmissions were recorded. The predictive values of baseline LVEF at admission and LVEF 6 months posttreatment were analyzed and compared. The posttreatment LVEFs were predictive for future events (P = 0.01 for all-cause mortality, P < 0.001 for HF readmission), but the baseline LVEFs were not. In Protocol 2, the outcomes of patients with improved LVEF (change of LVEF: \u2265+10%), unchanged LVEF (change of LVEF: -10% to +10%), and reduced LVEF (change of LVEF: \u2264-10%) were analyzed and compared. Improved LVEF occurred in 171 patients and was associated with a superior long-term prognosis among all groups (P = 0.02 for all-cause mortality, P < 0.001 for HF readmission).

To improve care, investigations are underway to better understand DFU pathogenesis and develop more effective therapies. Some currently used medications may improve healing. One small, randomized clinical trial found statins improve DFU healing. In this secondary analysis of a large multisite prospective observational cohort of 139 patients with DFUs receiving standard care, we investigated whether there was an association between 6-week DFU wound size reduction and use of a variety of medications including alpha-blockers, beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and statins. We found no significant (p\u2009<\u20090.05) association between six-week wound reduction and use of any of the evaluated drugs; however, statins did trend toward an association (p\u2009=\u20090.057). This suggests a potential benefit of statins on DFU healing, and larger, targeted studies are warranted.",

Recent studies suggest that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, a set of drugs used to treat hypertension, may inhibit amyloid formation in vitro. In the present study, we investigate through computer simulations the binding of ACE inhibitors to patient-derived A\u03b2 fibrils and contrast it with that of ACE inhibitors binding to in vitro generated fibrils. The binding affinities of the ACE inhibitors are compared with that of Congo red, a dye that is used to identify amyloid structures and that is known to be a weak inhibitor of A\u03b2 aggregation. We find that ACE inhibitors have a lower binding affinity to the patient-derived fibrils than to in vitro generated ones. For patient-derived fibrils, their binding affinities are even lower than that of Congo red. Our observations raise doubts on the hypothesis that these drugs inhibit fibril formation in Alzheimer patients by interacting directly with the amyloids.",

Candidate agents must be safe, well tolerated, effective, guideline recommended and physiochemically compatible with the other components of the pill. The Fuster-CNIC-Ferrer cardiovascular (CV) polypill has been found to be the first-in-class polypill to be approved and commercialized in Europe and Latinamerican Countries.

For each patient, the three drugs will be prescribed in random order and each drug will be taken for 2\u00a0weeks. The effectiveness of each therapy will be measured with 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, and tolerability will be assessed using a side effect questionnaire. Participants will rotate through treatment periods, repeating drugs and adjusting doses until the preferred therapy is identified. In assessing whether one of the medications is most effective for the majority of subjects, the primary outcome will be the percentage of participants for whom each drug is selected as the preferred therapy.

Nephrologists waive to treat IgAN pts with chronic renal insufficiency, believing that treatment may not be effective and safe. Moreover, studies in IgAN pts with reduced renal function are lacking. Small studies seem to indicate a possible utility of RAS blockers and corticosteroids in these patients. Recently, VALIGA study showed that corticosteroids and immunosuppressants were more frequently used in pts with eGFR <30\u00a0ml/min than in those with eGFR >30\u00a0ml/min (60 vs. 44\u00a0%, respectively; p\u00a0=\u00a00.004). The goal of treating IgAN pts is to obtain a time-average proteinuria <1\u00a0g/day, regardless of the degree of renal function and histological damage. RASB and corticosteroids seem to be able to obtain this result. However, it's important to pay attention to the appearance of adverse events of CS. In the literature, major side effects occurred in 29 of 463 (6.2\u00a0%) patients enrolled in RCTs. However, scarce informations are obtained about the safety of CS in patients with reduced renal function. To better evaluate this aspect, we considered three studies, that used similar schemes of therapy and included patients with different degrees of renal function (1: GFR 90\u00a0ml/min/1.73\u00a0m(2), 2: 81\u00a0ml/min/1.73\u00a0m(2), 3: 34\u00a0ml/min/1.73\u00a0m(2)). The occurrence of adverse events increased with the worsening of renal function (2.3, 5.7 and 15.4\u00a0% in studies 1, 2 and 3 respectively). The aim of the treatment for a patient with an eGFR <30 is to slow the progression and to delay the need for dialysis. Therefore, in stage CKD 2, 3 and 4 with a proteinuria >1\u00a0g/day a 6-month course of corticosteroids could be useful and safe.",

As a consequence of their ability to modulate tubuloglomerular feedback, SGLT2 inhibitors, like agents that block the renin-angiotensin system, reduce intraglomerular pressure and single nephron GFR, potentially affording renoprotection. To examine this further we administered the SGLT2 inhibitor, dapagliflozin, to 5/6 (subtotally) nephrectomised rats, a model of progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD) that like CKD in humans is characterised by single nephron hyperfiltration and intraglomerular hypertension and where angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers are demonstrably beneficial. When compared with untreated rats, both sham surgery and 5/6 nephrectomised rats that had received dapagliflozin experienced substantial glycosuria. Nephrectomised rats developed hypertension, heavy proteinuria and declining GFR that was unaffected by the administration of dapagliflozin. Similarly, SGLT2 inhibition did not attenuate the extent of glomerulosclerosis, tubulointerstitial fibrosis or overexpression of the profibrotic cytokine, transforming growth factor-\u00df1 mRNA in the kidneys of 5/6 nephrectomised rats. While not precluding beneficial effects in the diabetic setting, these findings indicate that SGLT2 inhibition does not have renoprotective effects in this classical model of progressive non-diabetic CKD.",

In the present study we tested the role of MMPs in resistant albuminuria. First we evaluated gelatinase MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity by zymography in the Munich Wistar Fr\u00f6mter (MWF) rat, a model of progressive albuminuria, and subsequently in patients with resistant albuminuria. Markers of oxidative stress were observed in the kidneys of MWF rats, together with a significant increase in pro-MMP-2 and active MMP-9 forms. These changes were normalized together with reduced albuminuria in consomic MWF-8(SHR) rats, in which chromosome 8 of MWF was replaced with the respective chromosome from spontaneously hypertensive rats. The MMP-2 and MMP-9 protein levels were similar in patients with normal and resistant albuminuria; however, high circulating levels of collagen IV, a specific biomarker of tissue collagen IV degradation, were observed in patients with resistant albuminuria. These patients showed a significant increase in gelatinase MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity, but only a significant increase in the active MMP-9 form quantified by ELISA, which correlated significantly with the degree of albuminuria. Although the expression of the tissue inhibitor of MMP-9 (TIMP)-1 was similar, a novel AlphaLISA assay demonstrated that the MMP-9-TIMP-1 interaction was reduced in patients with resistant albuminuria. It is of interest that oxidized TIMP-1 expression was higher in patients with resistant albuminuria. Therefore, increased circulating MMP-9 activity is associated with resistant albuminuria and a deleterious oxidative stress environment appears to be the underlying mechanism.

Its prevalence appears to be about 30-45% of the general population. Recent European guidelines estimate that up to 15-20% of the hypertensive patients are not controlled on a dual antihypertensive combination and they require three or more different antihypertensive drug classes to achieve adequate blood pressure control. The guidelines confirmed that diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers are suitable for the initiation and maintenance of antihypertensive treatment, either as monotherapy or in combination therapy. Very few antihypertensive agents have reached the market over the last few years, but no new therapeutic class has really emerged. The long-term adherence to cardiovascular drugs is still low in both primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases. In particular, the issue of compliance is persistently high in hypertension, despite the fixed-dose combination therapy. As a consequence, a cohort of high-risk hypertensive population, represented by patients affected by refractory and resistant hypertension, can be identified. Therefore, the need of controlling BP in high-risk patients may be addressed, in part, by the development of new drugs, devices and procedures that are designed to treat hypertension and comorbidities.

    "1118": "Adult hypertension can be divided into two relatively distinct forms-systolic/diastolic hypertension in midlife and systolic hypertension of the aged. The two types differ in prevalence, pathophysiology, and therapy. The prevalence of systolic hypertension in the elderly is twice that of midlife hypertension. The systolic pressure is elevated in both forms, but the high diastolic pressure in midlife is due to a raised total peripheral resistance, whereas the normal or low diastolic pressure in the elderly is due to aortic stiffening. Aortic stiffness, as measured by the carotid/femoral pulse wave velocity, has been found to be a cardiovascular risk marker independent of traditional risk factors for atherosclerosis. Instead, it is related to microcirculatory disease of the brain and kidney and to disorders of inflammation. Loss of aortic distensibility is an inevitable consequence of aging, but a review of its causes suggests that it may be amenable to future pharmacologic therapy.",

LVNC with dilation and/or dysfunction is associated with a greater mortality risk. We hypothesized that initiation of heart failure medications in patients with LVNC and ventricular dysfunction or dilation would improve systolic function and result in favorable left ventricular remodeling. The study was a retrospective chart review. Inclusion criteria included: presence of LVNC, reduced systolic function or ventricular dilation, therapy with at least one medication (beta blocker, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin II receptor blocker), imaging pre- and post-initiation of therapy. Fifty-one patients met inclusion criteria. Mean age at initiation of medication was 11.5 \u00b1 11.8 years. Follow-up was 2.4 \u00b1 2.3 years. Three patients (6 %) were solely on a beta blocker, 15 (29 %) on ACE/ARB monotherapy, and 33 (65 %) on dual therapy. At follow-up 45/51 patients (88 %) had improvement in ejection fraction/shortening and 6/51 (12 %) had no change. Ejection fraction, shortening fraction, and left ventricular end-diastolic dimension in the cohort before and after therapeutic intervention demonstrated a 16 \u00b1 12 % improvement in ejection fraction (p < 0.0001), an 8 \u00b1 9 % improvement in shortening fraction (p < 0.0001), and a 0.83 \u00b1 1.93 (p < 0.05) decrease in left ventricular end-diastolic z-score.

This mechanism may also inhibit muscle relaxation in early stages of cardiomyopathy. ACE inhibition (ACEi) is known to delay the onset and slow the progression of DCM in DMD. The objective of this study is to use echocardiography to assess for preclinical cardiac changes consistent with intracellular calcium dysregulation before the onset of overt ventricular dysfunction, and to evaluate how prophylactic ACEi may alter these pre-cardiomyopathic changes in the pediatric DMD population. We examined 263 echocardiograms from 70 pediatric patients with DMD. We defined abnormal tonic contraction (TC) as left ventricular internal dimension in diastole (LVIDd) Z-score < -1.5. In our cohort, we found that TC is detectable as early as 8 years of age, and most commonly affects patients between 11 and 15 years. This effect was independent of LV mass and systolic function. Prophylactic ACEi decreased the incidence of TC (p = 0.007) and preserved cardiac function (p < 0.0001). Left ventricular TC often precedes DCM in DMD, most commonly affecting the 11- to 15-year-old age range. TC is not related to ventricular hypertrophy, but rather may be a clinical correlate of the \"calcium hypothesis\" of DMD pathophysiology. LV TC is thus a promising biomarker for early detection of cardiomyopathy in DMD. ACEi prophylaxis suppresses LV TC and delays the development of DCM in DMD.",

The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of activation of the Vitamin D receptor with calcitriol on albuminuria and urinary angiotensinogen as a novel biomarker of the intra-renal RAAS status in patients with diabetic nephropathy (DN).", 
    "1173": "Ninety-eight patients with type 2 diabetes and albuminuria who were treated with RAAS inhibitors (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-i) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB)) have participated in this study. Patients were randomized to receive either placebo (n\u2009=\u200950) or 0.25\u2009\u03bcg/day calcitriol (n\u2009=\u200948). We have examined urinary albumin:Cr ratio and urinary angiotensinogen:Cr ratio before and 24 weeks later after treatment in both group.", 
    "1174": "The mean urinary albumin:Cr ratio and urinary angiotensinogen:Cr ratio were significantly higher in patients with DN than in normal controls (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Urinary angiotensinogen:Cr ratio was significantly, positively correlated with urinary albumin:Cr ratio in both groups (in the placebo group; p\u2009=\u20090.01, r\u2009=\u20090.4236, in calcitriol group; p\u2009=\u20090.01, r\u2009=\u20090.4564).", 
    "1175": "These data indicated that administration of Vitamin D receptor activator in combination with RAAS inhibitors had an additional benefit in lowering albuminuria in patients with DN. More pronounced reduction of urinary albumin:Cr ratio that was positively correlated with angiotensinogen:Cr ratio in calcitriol group suggested that Vitamin D receptor activation might blunt albuminuria by reducing urinary angiotensinogen levels reflecting intra-renal RAAS status.", 
    "1176": "Autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease, REN-related (ADTKD-REN) (previously familial juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy type 2 [FJHN2]) is characterized by: hypoproliferative anemia with low hemoglobin concentrations, found in most affected children by age one year; hyperuricemia and gout, found in most (not all) affected individuals; and slowly progressive chronic tubulointerstitial kidney disease. Some affected children have polyuria (excessive urine production leading to frequent urination) and enuresis. Mildly elevated serum creatinine concentration and reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate in an asymptomatic child often progresses to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the fourth to sixth decades of life. Of note, information on only fourteen families with this condition has been published; better understanding of the disease is likely to emerge when more families are described.", 
    "1177": "Diagnosis is based on findings of hypoproliferative anemia (low reticulocyte count relative to hemoglobin concentration and low erythropoietin concentration), hyperuricemia (serum uric acid concentration >6 mg/dL), decreased fractional excretion of urinary uric acid, bland urinary sediment, and low plasma renin activity. Kidney size is normal or small with no evidence of cyst formation. REN (encoding renin) is the only gene in which mutation is known to cause ADTKD-REN.", 
    "1178": "Treatment of manifestations: Anemia may be reversed by erythropoietin; acute gout typically responds well to prednisone or colchicine. Treatment of low plasma renin activity/low plasma concentration of aldosterone may be indicated prior to the development of stage III chronic kidney disease. If hyperkalemia is present, treatment with fludrocortisone or potassium restriction may be indicated. When end-stage kidney disease develops, kidney transplantation can be performed. ADTKD-REN does not recur in the transplanted kidney, which produces renin in a normal manner. Prevention of primary manifestations: Treatment of hyperuricemia with allopurinol can prevent development of gout. Surveillance: Measurement of hemoglobin concentration and serum concentration of uric acid and creatinine annually starting at the time of diagnosis. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, especially in persons who are dehydrated. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors could aggravate the underlying relative renin deficit. Volume depletion and dehydration as well as high meat and seafood intake could exacerbate gout. Patients should not be on the low sodium diet that is typically used in chronic kidney disease. Evaluation of relatives at risk: If the REN pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, molecular genetic testing of at-risk relatives may be considered, particularly in: children because of their increased risk for anemia; adolescents because of their increased risk for gout, which can be prevented with appropriate treatment; and relatives considering kidney donation.", 
    "1179": "ADTKD-REN is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Each child of an affected individual has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Once the pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for at-risk pregnancies is possible.",

However, clinical studies comparing FDCs of angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB)/calcium channel blocker (CCB) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE inhibitor)/CCB in hypertensive patients are lacking.Using a propensity score matching of 4:1 ratio, this retrospective claims database study compared 2 FDC regimens, ARB/CCB and ACE inhibitor/CCB, in treating hypertensive patients with no known atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. All patients were followed for at least 3 years or until the development of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) during the study period. In addition, the effect of medication adherence on clinical outcomes was evaluated in subgroup analysis based on different portions of days covered.There was no significant difference in MACE-free survival (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.21; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.98-1.50; P = 0.08) and survival free from hospitalization for heart failure (HR: 1.15; 95% CI: 082-1.61; P\u200a=\u200a0.431), new diagnosis of chronic kidney disease (HR: 0.98; 95% CI: 071-1.36; P\u200a=\u200a0.906), and initiation of dialysis (HR: 0.99; 95% CI: 050-1.92; P\u200a=\u200a0.965) between the 2 study groups. The results remained the same within each subgroup of patients with different adherence statuses.ARBs in FDC regimens with CCBs in the present study were shown to be as effective as ACE inhibitors at reducing the risks of MACEs, hospitalization for heart failure, new diagnosis of chronic kidney disease, and new initiation of dialysis in hypertensive patients, regardless of the medication adherence status.", 
    "1185": "Microcystin-LR (MC-LR) is a toxin produced by various cyanobacterial strains. Its cytotoxicity is due to inhibition of the protein phosphatases PP1 and PP2A, resulting in hyperphosphorylation of a number of functional and cytoskeletal proteins. To penetrate through the plasma membrane, MC-LR needs specific transporters such the organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATP) that are highly expressed on the hepatocytes. Hence, our goal was to investigate the role of the membrane transport proteins for the cytotoxic effect of MC-LR on adhesive cell lines different from hepatocytes. We have used three cell lines--A549 (human lung carcinoma), SK-Hep-1 (human liver adenocarcinoma), FL (human amniotic normal cells), and two inhibitors of the OATP (cyclosporine A and captopril). To examine the cytotoxic effect of MC-LR we applied MTT and Neutral Red assays. In addition, a fluorescent staining of the mitochondria by JC-1 was performed. A dose-dependent cytotoxic effect was observed for the three cell lines, as this effect was most pronounced in A549. No cytotoxicity was detected when the captopril was added 2 h before treatment of the cells with MC-LR. Addition of captopril to the cells 2 h after treatment with MC-LR leads to enhancement of the cytotoxic effect. Reduced mitochondrial membrane potential after treatment with MC-LR was detected in the three cell lines, compared to untreated control cells. Results from the NR-cytotoxicity assay indicated that MC-LR does not affect the lysosomes. Captopril is an effective inhibitor of both OATP influx membrane transport proteins and the P-gp efflux pumps involved in the transport of MC-LR. It protects the cells from toxic effects of the cyanotoxin MC-LR.",
