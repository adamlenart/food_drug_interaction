JBP485 caused a significant decrease in the accumulation of endogenous substances (creatinine, blood urea nitrogen and indoxyl sulfate) in vivo, an increase in the excretion of exogenous compounds (lisinopril and inulin) into urine, and up-regulation of the expressions of renal Oat1 and Oat3 in the kidney tissues and slices via substrate induction. To determine the effect of JBP485 on the accelerated excretion of uremic toxins mediated by Oat1 and Oat3, the mRNA and protein expression levels of renal basolateral Oats were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR, western blot, immunohistochemical analysis and an immunofluorescence method. Gentamicin down-regulated the expression of Oats mRNA and protein in rat kidney, and these effects were reversed after administration of JBP485. In addition, JBP485 caused a significant decrease in MPO and MDA levels in the kidney, and improved the pathological condition of rat kidney. These results indicated that JBP485 improved acute renal failure by increasing the expression and function of Oat1 and Oat3, and by decreasing overoxidation of the kidney in gentamicin-induced ARF rats.",

An evaluation of potentially modifiable risk factors such as hypertension and medication usage has not been undertaken to our knowledge. The authors thus reviewed a cohort of 45 consecutive patients with cerebral dAVF with leptomeningeal venous drainage and compared the rate of hemorrhagic presentation for patients with and without a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia or the usage of certain medications. Logistic regression was performed to determine the statistical significance of associations of each factor with hemorrhagic presentation. On univariate analysis, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors (odds ratio [OR] 0.100, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0-0.764, p=0.024) and statins (OR 0.142, 95% CI 0.025-0.825, p=0.030) were associated with a statistically significant lower rate of hemorrhagic presentation. A trend toward a lower rate of hemorrhagic presentation was seen for patients taking aspirin (OR 0.153, 95% CI 0.016-1.43, p=0.10). These trends continued on multivariate analysis; however they did not meet statistical significance (p>0.05). Beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, warfarin and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors did not have a statistically significant association with the rate of hemorrhagic presentation (p>0.05). Although limited by small sample size, these results may suggest a beneficial effect of statins and ACE-inhibitors on the rate of dAVF hemorrhagic presentation, potentially as a result of anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenic or even venous antithrombotic mechanisms. Despite this study's limitations, we hope it encourages further evaluation of potentially modifiable risk factors for vascular malformation hemorrhage.",

Arterial underfilling with consequent neurohormonal activation, systemic and intrarenal vasoconstriction, and salt and water retention cause the main clinical features of CRS which include a progressive decline in renal function, worsening renal function during treatment of heart failure (HF) decompensation and resistance to loop diuretics. Impaired renal function in HF patients often reflects more advanced stages of cardiac failure, and thus is associated with a worse prognosis. However, a transient fall in glomerular filtration rate may be a result of successful treatment of congestion, and thereby might not be associated with decreased survival in HF patients. This review covers basic pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the CRS and current trends in practical approaches to treat these patients.",

Hypertension is a risk factor for the aggravation of CI, and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is a key player in the increased incidence and development of hypertension. Therefore, the RAAS is considered to be a promoting factor for CI development. Conversely, recent studies have shown that lowering blood pressure with RAAS inhibitors decreases the incidence of CI, dementia and cardiovascular disease. Blood-brain barrier-penetrating RAAS inhibitors appear to have advantages in preventing cognitive decline because they can suppress the RAAS in the hippocampus, which has an important role in cognition. Thus, RAAS blockage is a notable strategy for preventing CI.",

We examined whether treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, temocapril, or an AT1-receptor blocker, olmesartan, prevented elevation of Ang II levels in the kidney of angiotensin I (Ang I)-infused rats. Rats were infused with Ang I (100 ng/min) and treated with temocapril (30 mg/kg per day, n = 10) or olmesartan (10 mg/kg per day, n = 9) for 4 weeks. Ang I infusion significantly elevated blood pressure compared with vehicle-infused rats (n = 6). Treatment with temocapril or olmesartan suppressed Ang I-induced hypertension. Temocapril suppressed both plasma and renal ACE activity. Ang I infusion increased Ang II content in the kidney. Interestingly, temocapril failed to reduce the level of Ang II in the kidney, while olmesartan markedly suppressed an increase in renal Ang II levels. These results suggest a limitation of temocapril and a benefit of olmesartan to inhibit the renal renin-angiotensin system and suggest the possible existence of an ACE inhibitor-insensitive pathway that increases Ang II levels in rat kidney.",

Data from six European countries for the time period 1991 to 2006 are used to study the cases of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and proton pump inhibitors. Empirical evidence shows that patent expiry of captopril and enalapril led to a switch in total (off-patent originator and generic) consumption towards other in-patent angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, whereas patent expiry of omeprazole led to a switch in consumption towards other proton pump inhibitors. This phenomenon makes generic policies ineffective and results in an increase in pharmaceutical expenditure due to the absence of generic alternatives in the market of in-patent molecules.",

These properties can be calculated rapidly and are thus amenable to high-throughput industrial applications. Their statistical performance was compared with that of conventional 3D-QSAR approaches using nine data sets (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE), acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AchE), benzodiazepine receptor ligands (BZR), cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (COX2), dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors (DHFR), glycogen phosphorylase b inhibitors (GPB), thermolysin inhibitors (THER), thrombin inhibitors (THR), and serine protease factor Xa inhibitors (fXa)). The 3D-QSAR models generated were tested thoroughly for robustness and predictive ability. The average performance of the quantum mechanical molecular interaction field (QM-MIF) models for the nine data sets is better than that of the conventional force field-based MIFs. In the individual data sets, the QM-MIF models always perform better than, or as well as, the conventional approaches. It is particularly encouraging that the relative performance of the QM-MIF models improves in the external validation. In addition, the models generated showed statistical stability with respect to model building procedure variations such as grid spacing size and grid orientation. QM-MIF contour maps reproduce the features important for ligand binding for the example data set (factor Xa inhibitors), demonstrating the intuitive chemical interpretability of QM-MIFs.",

Of these patients, 108 were male (64.3%) and 60 were female (35.7%). The median age of disease onset was 38 years (range 12-78 years). The median case history was 10 months (range 4 days to 30 years). The mean proteinuria level was 2.3 \u00b1 0.6 g/day. 75 (44.6%) patients had nephrotic syndrome.

In the group treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker, the following factors were identified as risk factors for experiencing a 50% increase in serum creatinine over the baseline: a baseline eGFR <60 ml/min, proteinuria >1 g/day during the follow-up period, glomerular sclerosis >grade 1, and tubulointerstitial lesions >stage 1. In the group treated with steroids, patients who achieved a stable remission had better preserved renal function and milder glomerular sclerosis than steroid-dependent patients (p < 0.01). Steroid-resistant FSGS patients had a worse histological severity of glomerular sclerosis than steroid-dependent patients (p < 0.01). The prognosis of FSGS was correlated with the amount of proteinuria, the level of serum creatinine, and the severity of glomerular sclerosis and tubulointerstitial lesions.

Through development of novel enzyme screening assays and significant medicinal chemistry efforts, highly potent inhibitors of CYP11B2 have been identified with selectivities approaching 1000-fold between the two enzymes. Many of these molecules also possess selectivity against other steroidogenic cytochromes P450 (e.g. CYP17A1 and CYP19A1) as well as hepatic drug metabolizing P450s. Though not as well developed or explored, inhibitors of CYP11B1, with selectivities approaching 50-fold, have also been identified. The therapeutic benefits of affecting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system have been well established with the therapeutically useful angiotensin-converting enzymes inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists.

    "50": "In the June 2011 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine, the BEAM (Bardoxolone Methyl Treatment: Renal Function in CKD/Type 2 Diabetes) trial investigators rekindled new interest and also some controversy regarding the concept of renoprotection and the role of renoprotective agents, when they reported significant increases in the mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in diabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients with an eGFR of 20-45 ml/min/1.73 m(2) of body surface area at enrollment who received the trial drug bardoxolone methyl versus placebo. Unfortunately, subsequent phase IIIb trials failed to show that the drug is a safe alternative renoprotective agent. Current renoprotection paradigms depend wholly and entirely on angiotensin blockade; however, these agents [angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)] have proved to be imperfect renoprotective agents. In this review, we examine the mechanistic limitations of the various previous randomized controlled trials on CKD renoprotection, including the paucity of veritable, elaborate and systematic assessment methods for the documentation and reporting of individual patient-level, drug-related adverse events. We review the evidence base for the presence of putative, multiple independent and unrelated pathogenetic mechanisms that drive (diabetic and non-diabetic) CKD progression. Furthermore, we examine the validity, or lack thereof, of the hyped notion that the blockade of a single molecule (angiotensin II), which can only antagonize the angiotensin cascade, would veritably successfully, consistently and unfailingly deliver adequate and qualitative renoprotection results in (diabetic and non-diabetic) CKD patients. We clearly posit that there is this overarching impetus to arrive at the inference that multiple, disparately diverse and independent pathways, including any veritable combination of the mechanisms that we examine in this review, and many more others yet to be identified, do concurrently and asymmetrically contribute to CKD initiation and propagation to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in our CKD patients. We conclude that current knowledge of CKD initiation and progression to ESRD, the natural history of CKD and the impacts of acute kidney injury on this continuum remain in their infancy and call for more research. Finally, we suggest a new classification scheme for renoprotective agents: (1) the single-pathway blockers that block a single putative pathogenetic pathway involved in CKD progression, as typified by ACE inhibitors and/or ARBs, and (2) the multiple-pathway blockers that are able to block or antagonize the effects of multiple pathogenetic pathways through their ability to simultaneously block, downstream, the effects of several pathways or mechanisms of CKD to ESRD progression and could therefore concurrently interfere with several unrelated upstream pathways or mechanisms. We surmise that maybe the ideal and truly renoprotective agent, clearly a multiple-pathway blocker, is on the horizon. This calls for more research efforts from all.",

Twenty-four broiler chickens were randomly divided into 3 groups (n = 8), including the control group, low temperature group, and imidapril group. Chickens in the control group were raised at normal temperature, whereas chickens in the low temperature group and imidapril group were exposed to low ambient temperature (12 to 18\u00b0C) from 14 d of age until 45 d of age. At the same time, chickens in the imidapril group were gavaged with imidapril at 3 mg/kg once daily for 30 d. The thickness of the right ventricular wall was observed with echocardiography. The BW and wet lung weight as well as weight of right and left ventricles and ventricular septum were measured. Both wet lung weight index and right ventricular hypertrophy index were calculated. Pulmonary arterial systolic pressure was assessed according to echocardiography. The expression of ACE and ACE2 mRNA in the right ventricular myocardial tissue was quantified by real-time PCR. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen-positive cells were detected by immunohistostaining. The concentration of angiotensin (Ang) II and Ang (1-7) in the right ventricular myocardial tissue was measured with ELISA. The results showed that right ventricular hypertrophy index, wet lung weight index, pulmonary arterial systolic pressure, expression of ACE mRNA in the right ventricular tissue, Ang II concentration, and the thickness of the right ventricular wall in the low temperature group increased significantly compared with those in the control group and imidapril group. The ACE2 mRNA expression increased 36%, whereas Ang (1-7) concentration decreased significantly in the low temperature group compared with that in the control group and imidapril group. In conclusion, imidapril inhibits right ventricular remodeling induced by low ambient temperature in broiler chickens.",

In liquid diet-fed control rats, enalapril- (10 mg/kg) evoked hypotension was abolished by l-NIO (20 mg/kg), but not by NPLA (1 mg/kg) or 1400W (5 mg/kg), suggesting a preferential role for eNOS in this response. Enalapril had no effect on spectral indices of hemodynamic variability or +dP/dtmax (myocardial contractility). However, in ethanol-fed rats, the greater enalapril-evoked hypotension was associated with reductions in (i) +dP/dtmax, (ii) low-frequency/high-frequency ratio of interbeat intervals (IBILF/HF), suggesting cardiac parasympathetic dominance, and (iii) low-frequency spectral band of systolic blood pressure (BP), a marker of vasomotor sympathetic tone. While NPLA or 1400W attenuated the enalapril-evoked hemodynamic and autonomic responses in ethanol-fed rats, l-NIO virtually abolished the hypotensive response and was more efficacious in rectifying autonomic responses to enalapril.

The compounds were discovered by screening a chemical library of compounds for blocking of entry of HIV-1 pseudotyped with SARS-CoV surface glycoprotein S (SARS-S) but not that of HIV-1 pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus surface glycoprotein G (VSV-G). Studies on their mechanisms of action revealed that the compounds act by three distinct mechanisms: (i) SSAA09E2 {N-[[4-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)phenyl]methyl]-1,2-oxazole-5-carboxamide} acts through a novel mechanism of action, by blocking early interactions of SARS-S with the receptor for SARS-CoV, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2); (ii) SSAA09E1 {[(Z)-1-thiophen-2-ylethylideneamino]thiourea} acts later, by blocking cathepsin L, a host protease required for processing of SARS-S during viral entry; and (iii) SSAA09E3 [N-(9,10-dioxo-9,10-dihydroanthracen-2-yl)benzamide] also acts later and does not affect interactions of SARS-S with ACE2 or the enzymatic functions of cathepsin L but prevents fusion of the viral membrane with the host cellular membrane. Our work demonstrates that there are at least three independent strategies for blocking SARS-CoV entry, validates these mechanisms of inhibition, and introduces promising leads for the development of SARS therapeutics.", 
    "74": "The increase in survivorship of cancer patients makes the understanding of the available options for prevention and treatment of cardiotoxicity induced by antineoplastic agents a crucial topic both for cardiologists and oncologists. The most frequent and typical clinical manifestation of cardiotoxicity is asymptomatic or symptomatic left ventricular dysfunction, which may progress to overt heart failure. It may be induced not only by conventional cancer therapy, like anthracyclines, but also by new antitumoral targeted therapy such as trastuzumab. The current standard for monitoring cardiac damage during antineoplastic treatment, mainly based on the quantification of left ventricular ejection fraction, detects cardiac toxicity only when a functional impairment has already occurred. Evaluation of cardiac biomarkers such as troponin, however, has shown excellent sensitivity in the early detection of cardiotoxicity by the identification of patients with subclinical cardiac injury that precedes the development of cardiac dysfunction. The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with troponin elevation during chemotherapy may be an effective tool to prevent left ventricular ejection fraction reduction and late cardiac events. There are no well established recommendations for treatment of cancer patients who develop cardiac dysfunction. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers have proven to be effective in this setting. However, there are concerns in using these medications in cancer patients, and therefore the tendency is to treat patients only if symptomatic. However, the clinical benefit of these medications may be more evident in asymptomatic patients, and the recovery of cardiac function strongly depends on the amount of time elapsed from the end of chemotherapy to the start of heart failure therapy. This observation suggests that the early detection of cardiac damage is crucial and early use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers should be considered in patients with left ventricular dysfunction induced by antineoplastic agents.",

    "76": "The mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory and antihypertensive effects of long-chain \u03c9-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (\u03c9-3 PUFAs) are still unclear. The epoxides of an \u03c9-6 fatty acid, arachidonic acid epoxyeicosatrienoic acids also exhibit antihypertensive and anti-inflammatory effects. Thus, we hypothesized that the major \u03c9-3 PUFAs, including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), may lower the blood pressure and attenuate renal markers of inflammation through their epoxide metabolites. Here, we supplemented mice with an \u03c9-3 rich diet for 3 weeks in a murine model of angiotensin-II-dependent hypertension. Also, because EPA and DHA epoxides are metabolized by soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH), we tested the combination of an sEH inhibitor and the \u03c9-3 rich diet. Our results show that \u03c9-3 rich diet in combination with the sEH inhibitor lowered Ang-II, increased the blood pressure, further increased the renal levels of EPA and DHA epoxides, reduced renal markers of inflammation (ie, prostaglandins and MCP-1), downregulated an epithelial sodium channel, and upregulated angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 message and significantly modulated cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase metabolic pathways. Overall, our findings suggest that epoxides of the \u03c9-3 PUFAs contribute to lowering systolic blood pressure and attenuating inflammation in part by reduced prostaglandins and MCP-1 and by upregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 in angiotensin-II-dependent hypertension.",

    "82": "Two professional athletes in the U.S. National Basketball Association required surgery for aortic root dilation in 2012. These cases have attracted attention in sports medicine to the importance of aortic root disease in athletes. In addition to aortic root dilation, other forms of aortic disease include anomalous coronary artery, bicuspid aortic valve, and Marfan's syndrome. In this review, electronic database literature searches were performed using the terms \"aortic root\" and \"athletes.\" The literature search produced 122 manuscripts. Of these, 22 were on aortic root dilation, 21 on anomalous coronary arteries, 12 on bicuspid aortic valves, and 8 on Marfan's syndrome. Aortic root dilation is a condition involving pathologic dilation of the aortic root, which can lead to life-threatening sequelae. Prevalence of the condition among athletes and higher risk athletes in particular sports needs to be better delineated. Normative parameters for aortic root diameter in the general population are proportionate to anthropomorphic variables, but this has not been validated for athletes at the extremes of anthropomorphic indices. Although echocardiography is the favored screening modality, computed tomography (CT) and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are also used for diagnosis and surgical planning. Medical management has utilized beta-blockers, with more recent use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), and statins. Indications for surgery are based on comorbidities, degree of dilation, and rate of progression. Management decisions for aortic root dilation in athletes are nuanced and will benefit from the development of evidence-based guidelines. Anomalous coronary artery is another form of aortic disease with relevance in athletes. Diagnosis has traditionally been through cardiac catheterization, but more recently has included evaluation with echocardiography, multislice CT, and MRI. Athletes with this condition should be restricted from participation in competitive sports, but can be cleared for participation 6 months after surgical repair. Bicuspid aortic valve is another form of aortic root disease with significance in athletes. Although echocardiography has traditionally been used for diagnosis, CT and MRI have proven more sensitive and specific. Management of bicuspid aortic valve consists of surveillance through echocardiography, medical therapy with beta-blockers and ARBs, and surgery. Guidelines for sports participation are based on the presence of aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, and aortic root dilation. Marfan's syndrome is a genetic disorder with a number of cardiac manifestations including aortic root dilation, aneurysm, and dissection. Medical management involves beta-blockers and ARBs. Thresholds for surgical management differ from the general population. With regard to sports participation, the most important consideration is early detection. Athletes with the stigmata of Marfan's syndrome or with family history should be tested. Further research should determine whether more aggressive screening is warranted in sports with taller athletes. Athletes with Marfan's syndrome should be restricted from activities involving collision and heavy contact, avoid isometric exercise, and only participate in activities with low intensity, low dynamic, and low static components. In summary, many forms of aortic root disease afflict athletes and need to be appreciated by sports medicine practitioners because of their potential to lead to tragic but preventable deaths in an otherwise healthy population.",

    "88": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS), through angiotensin II and the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), is involved in the genesis and progression of fibrotic diseases characterized by the replacement of normal tissue by an accumulation of an extracellular matrix (ECM). Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) presents fibrosis and a decrease in muscle strength produced by chronic damage. The mdx mouse is a murine model of DMD and develops the same characteristics as dystrophic patients when subjected to chronic exercise. The connective tissue growth factor (CTGF/CCN2) and transforming growth factor type beta (TGF-\u03b2), which are overexpressed in muscular dystrophies, play a major role in many progressive scarring conditions. We have tested the hypothesis that ACE inhibition decreases fibrosis in dystrophic skeletal muscle by treatment of mdx mice with the ACE inhibitor enalapril. Both sedentary and exercised mdx mice treated with enalapril showed improvement in gastrocnemius muscle strength explained by a reduction in both muscle damage and ECM accumulation. ACE inhibition decreased CTGF expression in sedentary or exercised mdx mice and diminished CTGF-induced pro-fibrotic activity in a model of CTGF overexpression by adenoviral infection. Enalapril did not have an effect on TGF-\u03b21 expression or its signaling activity in sedentary or exercised dystrophic mice. Thus, ACE inhibition might improve muscle strength and decrease fibrosis by diminishing specifically CTGF expression and activity without affecting TGF-\u03b21 signaling. Our data provide insights into the pathogenic events in dystrophic muscle. We propose ACE as a target for developing therapies for DMD and related diseases.",

In this study we verified the idea that plasma homocysteine (Hcy) contributes to 'aspirin-resistance' in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and with or without type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A cross-designed randomized controlled intervention study has been performed (126 CAD pts incl. 26 with T2DM) to determine whether increasing ASA dose from 75mg to 150mg daily may result in the increased antiplatelet effect, in the course of four-week treatment. Platelet response to collagen (coll) or arachidonic acid (AA) was monitored with whole blood aggregometry, plasma thromboxane (Tx), and Hcy levels were determined immunochemically. The ASA-mediated reductions in platelet response to coll (by 12\u00b13%) or AA (by 10\u00b13%) and in plasma Tx (by 20\u00b19%; p<0.02 or less) were significantly greater for higher ASA dose and significantly correlated with plasma Hcy, which was significantly lower in \"good\" ASA responders compared to \"poor\" responders (p<0.001). Higher plasma Hcy appeared a significant risk factor for blood platelet refractoriness to low ASA dose (OR=1.11; \u00b195%CI: 1.02-1.20, p<0.02, adjusted to age, sex and CAD risk factors). Hcy diminished in vitro antiplatelet effect of low ASA concentration and augmented platelet aggregation (by up to 62% (p<0.005) for coll and up to 15% (p<0.005) for AA), whereas its acetyl derivative acted oppositely. Otherwise, Hcy intensified antiplatelet action of high ASA. Hyperhomocysteinaemia may be a novel risk factor for the suppressed blood platelet response to ASA, and homocysteine may act as a specific sensitizer of blood platelets to some agonists. While homocysteine per se acts as a proaggregatory agent to blood platelets, its acetylated form is able to reverse this effect. Thus, these findings reveal a possibly new challenging potential of the acetylating properties of ASA therapy.",

Rats were randomly separated into five groups: control, diabetes, diabetes treated with enalapril, diabetes treated with breviscapine, or diabetes treated with combined enalapril with breviscapine. Twenty-four hours urinary AER and the levels of 3-NT in renal tissue and MDA in renal tissue and urine as well as activities and expression of PKC in renal tissue were determined, and renal tissue morphology were observed by light microscopy after 8 weeks. Expression of TGF\u03b21 protein was performed by immunohistochemistry method. Increased AER and kidney pathologic injury were attenuated by treatment with either enalapril or breviscapine and further reduced by the combination of the two. Elevated 3-NT in renal tissue and MDA levels in renal tissue and urine were reduced by enalapril or breviscapine and, more effectively, by combined enalapril with breviscapine. PKC activities and expression were higher in renal tissue in diabetic rats than those of the control group, which were reduced by both monotherapies, and further abrogated by combination therapy in both cases. Overexpression of TGF\u03b21 protein observed in the glomeruli and tubulointerstitium of diabetic rats was attenuated by enalapril or breviscapine to a similar lever and further reduced by the combination of the two.

In addition, combination therapies, including angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and calcium channel blockers (CCBs), have the added benefit of reducing cardiovascular mortality and morbidity over other dual therapies while providing equivalent blood pressure control. It is possible that angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), which unlike ACE inhibitors are minimally affected by upregulation of alternative pathways for angiotensin II accumulation following long-term treatment, would also provide such outcome benefits.

Keeping this view in mind, we performed molecular dynamics simulation of crystal structure complex of testis truncated version of ACE (tACE) and its inhibitor lisinopril along with Zn(2+) to understand the dynamic behavior of active site residues of tACE. Root mean square deviation results revealed the stability of tACE throughout simulation. The residues Ala 354, Glu 376, Asp 377, Glu 384, His 513, Tyr 520 and Tyr 523 of tACE stabilized lisinopril by hydrogen bonding interactions. Using this information in subsequent part of study, molecular docking of tACE crystal structure with A\u03b2-peptide has been made to investigate the interactions of A\u03b2-peptide with enzyme tACE. The residues Asp 7 and Ser 8 of A\u03b2-peptide were found in close contact with Glu 384 of tACE along with Zn(2+). This study has demonstrated that the residue Glu 384 of tACE might play key role in the degradation of A\u03b2-peptide by cleaving peptide bond between Asp 7 and Ser 8 residues. Molecular basis generated by this attempt could provide valuable information towards designing of new therapies to control A\u03b2 concentration in Alzheimer's patient.",

Twenty-six patients with uncontrolled hypertension, receiving one drug or combined therapy at bedtime, showed a significant reduction in the 24-h mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure (6.2 and 2.6 mmHg, respectively; P<0.009). This reduction was more prominent during night-time (8.3 and 5.0 mmHg; P<0.001). In addition, all 26 patients showed normal blood pressure less than 140/90 during clinic measurement at daytime. Only four patients treated with monotherapy in the morning were unresponsive to the switching, and their blood pressure was controlled by the addition of a second drug at bedtime.

In particular, growth-restricted infants or infants born prematurely may develop a severe form of intestinal inflammation known as necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), which has a high mortality. Milk provides a multitude of proteins with anti-inflammatory properties and in this review we gather together some recent significant advances regarding the isolation and proteomic identification of these minor constituents of both human and bovine milk. We introduce the process of inflammation, with a focus on the immature gut, and describe how a multitude of milk proteins act against the inflammatory process according to both in vitro and in vivo studies. We highlight the effects of milk proteins such as caseins, and of whey proteins such as alpha-lactalbumin, beta-lactoglobulin, lactoferrin, osteopontin, immunoglobulins, trefoil factors, lactoperoxidase, superoxide dismutase, platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase, alkaline phosphatase, and growth factors (TGF-\u03b2, IGF-I and IGF-II, EGF, HB-EGF). The effects of milk fat globule proteins, such as TLR-2, TLR-4, sCD14 and MFG-E8/lactadherin, are also discussed. Finally, we indicate how milk proteins could be useful for the prophylaxis and therapy of intestinal inflammation in infants and children.",

Half of the patients suffered reduced circulation in the common carotid artery. The contribution of impaired extracranial circulation to cognitive dysfunction in the acute period of hypertonic crisis was higher than that of high SAD and DAD. Antihypertensive therapy improved bloodflow in extracranial vessels, decreased their systolic and diastolic indices but failed to eliminate mild cognitive disorders in 65% of the patients. Visual-spatial orientation was restored more frequently than verbal auditory memory. Enalaprilate and infedipine had similar angio- and cerebroprotective effects but the latter had more pronounced favourable effect on verbal auditory memory than the former. The degree of recovery of cognitive function 2 weeks after hypertonic crisis depended not only on the form of cognitive disorder and therapeutic modality but also on the patient's age. Hemodynamic parameters and age 2 weeks after antihypertensive therapy are predictors of residual cognitive dysfunction soon (2 weeks) after recovery.",

In the UK, the P4P framework is known as the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF). One of the key targets for intervention in primary care was hypertension. It is clear that hypertension is a major predictor of development and progression of CKD; thus, targeting better blood pressure control is likely to have a positive impact on outcomes in CKD. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of renal indicators outlined in P4P on the management of hypertension in primary care.

In the hypertensive patients, mean BP fell from 146/79 mmHg to 140/76 in the first 2 years post-P4P [P < 0.01, analysis of variance (ANOVA)]. This BP reduction was sustained in the last 2 years of the study, 139/75 (P < 0.01, ANOVA). The proportion of hypertensive patients taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin blockers increased, this was also sustained in the third time period. An increase in the prescribing of diuretics, calcium channel blockers and \u03b2-blockers was also observed. The additional cost of increased prescribing was calculated to be \u20ac25.00 per hypertensive patient based on GP prescription data.",

Patients were followed for an additional 12 months. Despite similar treatment escalation, NT-proBNP reduction and symptom relief were less in HFpEF than in HFrEF. Hospitalization-free survival at 18 months was worse in HFpEF than in HFrEF (P = 0.02), while survival and HF hospitalization-free survival did not differ. Among HFpEF patients, NT-proBNP reduction and symptom relief were similar in the symptom-guided (n = 59) and NT-proBNP-guided (n = 64) group despite more aggressive treatment in the NT-proBNP-guided group.

Based on electrochemical principles, it selectively removes apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins through extracorporeal precipitation with either heparin (Heparin-induced Extracorporeal LDL Precipitation, ie, HELP) or dextran sulfate (Liposorber). LDL-apheresis can lead to an acute decrease in LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) of 70%-80%, but there is a rapid rebound to baseline levels within approximately 2 weeks. LDL-apheresis is typically performed once-a-week in patients with homozygous FH and every other week in those with heterozygous FH to produce time-average LDL-C reductions of \u2248 40%. Side effects associated with LDL-apheresis include hypotension (later found to be due to concomitant use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors), nausea/vomiting, flushing, angina, and fainting. Posttreatment bleeding can occur secondary to heparin used during the procedure. Challenges associated with LDL-apheresis include vascular access often requiring an arteriovenous fistula (fistulas may clot and require revision over time), the time associated with each treatment session (2-4 hours), the frequency of treatment, and the scarcity of medical centers which perform LDL-apheresis. Given the nature of LDL-apheresis, randomized placebo controlled trials are nearly impossible, and virtually all studies of clinical benefit have been non-randomized investigations of small numbers of subjects. Nonetheless, results from those studies support the benefits of LDL-C reduction for reducing coronary atherosclerosis and cardiovascular events.",

The basis of AD is neurodegenerative process that leads to death of neurons in the cerebral cortex. This neurodegenerative process is associated with the formation of neurofibrillary tangles in the brain and the deposition of senile plaques, the main component of which is a beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta). Risk factors for AD are age, as well as hypertension, atherosclerosis, diabetes and hypercholesterolemia in the pathogenesis of which involved angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)--key enzyme of the renin-angiotensin (RAS) and kallikrein-kinin (KKS) systems. Recently it was discovered that ACE, along with other metallopeptidases, participates in the metabolism of Abeta, cleaving the bonds at the N-terminal and C-terminal region of the molecule Abeta. The role of the ACE in the degradation processes of Abeta takes an interest. It is associated with the fact that the using of ACE inhibitors is the main therapeutic approach used in the treatment of various forms of hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases. However, until now not been resolved, can be used antihypertensive drugs that inhibit RAS for the treatment or prevention of AD.

Therefore, we analyzed the use of beta-blockers and ACEIs after a breast cancer diagnosis and their association with breast cancer mortality, both individually, combined with each other, and in combination with aspirin use in the Nurses' Health Study, using updated measures of medication use and Cox proportional hazards models. There were 4,661 women with stages I-III breast cancer included; 292 breast cancer deaths occurred during median follow-up time of 10.5 years. Modeled individually, the multivariable relative risk and 95 % confidence intervals (RR, 95 % CI) for breast cancer death were (0.76, 0.54-1.05) for beta blockers, (0.89, 0.60-1.32) for ACEIs, and (0.46, 0.35-0.60) for aspirin.

We did not see a significant association with beta blockers and survival, but there was a suggestion. Our study was limited in that we could not assess type of beta blocker and the number of events among users was still quite low. We found no evidence of a protective effect for ACEIs. The strong protective association with aspirin use confounds the associations with these other drugs and underscores the importance of considering aspirin use in analyses of breast cancer survival.", 
    "192": "Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common and increasing in hospitalized patients. The earlier recognition of renal injury, at a stage described as 'incipient AKI', may allow renoprotective strategies to be initiated at a time when more kidney tissue is salvageable. 'Incipient AKI' represents renal injury as manifested by new-onset proteinuria, cellular activity on urine microscopy, or elevated novel biomarkers of kidney injury in the absence of clinical data that meet current diagnostic criteria for AKI. We propose three strategies to preserve kidney function and minimize further kidney injury in patients with 'incipient AKI'. These include--when appropriate for the prevailing cause of 'incipient AKI'--use of low-chloride-containing intravenous solutions, continued use of renin-angiotensin system antagonists, and use of diuretics to achieve adequate control of intravascular volume. The combined approach of the early diagnosis of AKI and early employment of feasible therapeutic strategies may slow the growth of clinical AKI, AKI requiring renal replacement therapy and chronic kidney disease, and might reduce AKI-associated mortality.",

The influences of antihypertensive drugs on the activity of CES remain undefined. In the present study, the inhibitory effects of 17 antihypertensive drugs on the CES1A1 and CES2 activities were evaluated. Imidapril and CPT-11 were used as substrates and cultured with liver microsomes in vitro.

Drug recoveries from spiked blood spots were \u2265 92% for bisoprolol and ramipril and ~43% for simvastatin and the drugs were stable in DBS for at least 12 weeks. Validation of the LC-HRMS method showed good linearity and the accuracy (relative error) and precision (coefficient of variation) values were within the pre-defined limits of \u2264 15% at all concentrations. Matrix effects and the effects of different volumes of blood applied to the collection card were investigated. The LC-HRMS method successfully identified control volunteers who were known to be either adherent or non-adherent. There were no false positives from volunteers taking other cardiovascular drugs or from volunteers receiving no medication.",

MD simulations and interaction energy calculations for docking and crystal structures were performed to investigate the correct conformation of the ACE with enalaprilat and nanopepetide. The analysis of root-mean-squrared fluctuation (RMSF), which is usually applied to measure the mobility and flexibility of the proteins, and dynamic correlation of residues show that the fluctuation pattern of the each two structure of the same ligand is almost the same mode. Hydrogen bond analysis shows that the correct crystal conformation is more stable than a wrong docking conformation. In addition, we are demonstrating that calculating interaction energy between protein and its ligands is an accurate and efficient way to select the correct conformation from docking conformations.",

In the present study, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were used to clarify whether green asparagus prevents hypertension by inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity. Six-week-old male SHR were fed a diet with (AD group) or without (ND group) 5% asparagus for 10 weeks. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) (AD: 159 \u00b1 4.8 mmHg, ND: 192 \u00b1 14.7 mmHg), urinary protein excretion/creatinine excretion, and ACE activity in the kidney were significantly lower in the AD group compared with the ND group. Creatinine clearance was significantly higher in the AD group compared with the ND group. In addition, ACE inhibitory activity was observed in a boiling water extract of asparagus. The ACE inhibitor purified and isolated from asparagus was identified as 2\u2033-hydroxynicotianamine. In conclusion, 2\u2033-hydroxynicotianamine in asparagus may be one of the factors inhibiting ACE activity in the kidney, thus preventing hypertension and preserving renal function.", 
    "197": "In this paper, aqueous extract fractions from byproducts of the processing of canned bamboo shoots, including boiled water, filled liquid, and squeezed juice, were obtained by 5 kDa molecular cutoff membranes and marcoporous resin DA201-C treatment. The enriched bamboo shoot angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptide preparation fraction (called BSP for short) was extracted with ethyl acetate and n-butanol. The ethyl acetate fraction and n-butanol fraction exhibited higher antioxidant capacities than the leaving water fraction (BSML), which was attributed to the higher phenolic acid and flavonoid content of both fractions, while BSML exhibited the strongest ACE inhibitory activity. Sephadex G-15 gel filtration and semipreparative high-performance liquid chromatography were used for further purification of bamboo shoot ACE inhibitory peptide from BSML. Asp-Tyr was identified as the key active component by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography and electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. A short-term antihypertensive assay stated that both Asp-Tyr [10 mg day(-1) (kg of body weight)(-1)] and BSP [50 mg day(-1) (kg of body weight)(-1)] could significantly reduce the systolic blood pressure of spontaneously hypertensive rats (3-6 h). This study provides further examples of utilization of byproducts from the processing of canned bamboo shoots for the prevention of hypertension and attenuation of oxidative stress.",

Here, we provide evidence for the potential role of angiotensin II (Ang II) in modulating splenic T cell responses in a rodent model of cerebral malaria. T cell activation induced by infection, determined by 3 to 4-fold enhancement in CD69 expression, was reduced to control levels when mice were treated with 20 mg/kg losartan (IC\u2085\u2080\u200a=\u200a0.966 mg/kg/d), an AT\u2081 receptor antagonist, or captopril (IC\u2085\u2080\u200a=\u200a1.940 mg/kg/d), an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Moreover, the production of interferon-\u03b3 and interleukin-17 by CD4+ T cells diminished 67% and 70%, respectively, by both treatments. Losartan reduced perforin expression in CD8+ T cells by 33% while captopril completely blocked it. The upregulation in chemokine receptor expression (CCR2 and CCR5) observed during infection was abolished and CD11a expression was partially reduced when mice were treated with drugs. T cells activated by Plasmodium berghei ANKA antigens showed 6-fold enhance in AT\u2081 levels in comparison with naive cells. The upregulation of AT\u2081 expression was reduced by losartan (80%) but not by captopril. Our results suggest that the AT\u2081/Ang II axis has a role in the establishment of an efficient T cell response in the spleen and therefore could participate in a misbalanced parasite-induced T cell immune response during P. berghei ANKA infection.",

The DWGP was sonicated before hydrolysis by Alcalase. Degree of hydrolysis, ACE-inhibitory activity, surface hydrophobicity, fluorescence intensity, free sulfhydryl (SH), and disulfide bond (SS) were determined. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity of DWGP hydrolysate was obtained at power intensity of 191.1 W/cm(2) for 10 min in the ultrasonic horn reactor. The fixed frequency of 33 kHz and the sweep frequency of 40\u00b12 kHz resulted in the maximum ACE-inhibitory activity. The combined irradiation of dual fixed frequency (24/68 kHz) produced significant increase in ACE-inhibitory activity compared with single frequency (33 kHz). The ultrasonic probe resulted in significant higher ACE-inhibitory activity compared with ultrasonic bath operating at single or dual fixed and sweep frequencies. The changes in conformation of the DWGP due to sonication were confirmed by the changes in fluorescence intensity, surface hydrophobicity, SHf and SS contents and they were found in conformity with the ACE-inhibitory activity in case of the ultrasonic horn reactor but not in bath reactor.",

Tolerance to organophosphates was observed with mortalities ranging from 95% to 98%. Bioassays run with a pre-exposition of mosquitoes to PBO induced very high levels of mortalities compared to the bioassays without PBO, suggesting that the resistance to pyrethroid and carbamate relied largely on detoxifying enzymes' activities. The L1014F kdr allelic frequency was 0.33 in 2012 compared to 0.05 before the crisis in 2002. Neither the L1014S kdr nor ace-1(R) mutations were detected.

    "220": "Aortic aneurysms are life-threatening and often associated with defects in connective tissues and mutations in smooth muscle cell (SMC) contractile proteins. Despite recent advances in understanding altered signaling in aneurysms of Marfan syndrome, the underlying mechanisms and options for pharmacological treatment for other forms of aneurysms are still under investigation. We previously showed in mice that deficiency in the fibulin-4 gene in vascular SMCs (Fbln4(SMKO)) leads to loss of the SMC contractile phenotype, hyperproliferation, and ascending aortic aneurysms. We report that abnormal up-regulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in SMCs and subsequent activation of angiotensin II (AngII) signaling are involved in the onset of aortic aneurysms in Fbln4(SMKO) mice. In this model, aneurysm formation was completely prevented by inhibition of the AngII pathway with losartan or captopril within a narrow therapeutic window during the first month of life, even though the altered mechanical properties of blood vessel walls were not reversed by the pharmacological treatment. The therapeutic effects of losartan in Fbln4(SMKO) mice do not require the AngII receptor type 2 (Agtr2) but likely require both type 1a (Agtr1a) and 1b (Agtr1b) receptors. The results indicate that fibulin-4 is a vascular matrix component required for regulation of local angiotensin signaling and development and maintenance of the SMC phenotype.", 
    "221": "Renin is a key component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which plays an important role in the maintenance of blood pressure and electrolyte-volume homeostasis. RAS also plays a role in cardiovascular (CV) disease as a result of effects on inflammation and oxidative stress. There is growing evidence that plasma renin activity may be a marker of CV risk in hypertensive patients. This increase in CV risk likely reflects activation of the RAS as a whole. Patients undergoing treatment for hypertension experience a reactive increase in renin, especially if treated with diuretics, vasodilators or agents that block the RAS. There is not sufficient evidence, however, that this reactive increase in renin is intrinsically harmful for hypertensive patients in whom adequate levels of RAS blockade have been achieved. Indeed, in such patients, additional RAS blockade may not be beneficial and may even increase the risk of adverse events. Plasma renin may be an important prognostic indicator in untreated patients, and one that can be used to help in the choice of antihypertensive treatment. Currently, however, the link between plasma renin and CV risk in treated patients is inconsistent between different populations and in various clinical conditions, calling for further investigation.",

We measured sistolic blood pressure (SBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), diastolic pressure, pulse pressure in the rats. Cathepsin B, L, DNA fragmentation and caspase-3 activities were determined from rat kidney tissues and rats clearance of creatinine calculated. Although HS diet increased significantly SBP, MAP, diastolic pressure, pulse pressure parameters compared the control values. They were not as high as accepted hypertension levels. When compared to HS groups, kefir groups significantly decrease Cathepsin B and DNA fragmentation levels. Caspase levels were elevated slightly in other groups according to control group. While, we also found that creatinine clearance was higher in HS+kefir and HS+low-dose aspirin than HS group. Thus, using low-dose aspirin had been approximately decreased of renal function damage. Kefir decreased renal function damage playing as Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. But, low-dose aspirin together with kefir worsened rat renal function damage. Cathepsin B might play role both apoptosis and prorenin-processing enzyme. But not caspase pathway may be involved in the present HS diet induced apoptosis. In conclusion, kefir and low-dose aspirin used independently protect renal function and renal damage induced by HS diet in rats.",

    "242": "Enalapril and losartan failed to reduce platelet activity both at rest and during exercise in hypertensive patients. Markers of inflammation, coagulation, and endothelial function were similarly unaffected. Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system promotes its beneficial effects in hypertension through mechanisms other than platelet inhibition.", 
    "243": "Earlier work showed that apoptosis of alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) in response to endogenous or xenobiotic factors is regulated by autocrine generation of angiotensin (ANG) II and its counterregulatory peptide ANG1-7. Mutations in surfactant protein C (SP-C) induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and apoptosis in AECs and cause lung fibrosis. This study tested the hypothesis that ER stress-induced apoptosis of AECs might also be regulated by the autocrine ANGII/ANG1-7 system of AECs. ER stress was induced in A549 cells or primary cultures of human AECs with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 or the SP-C BRICHOS domain mutant G100S. ER stress activated the ANGII-generating enzyme cathepsin D and simultaneously decreased the ANGII-degrading enzyme ACE-2, which normally generates the antiapoptotic peptide ANG1-7. TAPI-2, an inhibitor of ADAM17/TACE, significantly reduced both the activation of cathepsin D and the loss of ACE-2. Apoptosis of AECs induced by ER stress was measured by assays of mitochondrial function, JNK activation, caspase activation, and nuclear fragmentation. Apoptosis induced by either MG132 or the SP-C BRICHOS mutant G100S was significantly inhibited by the ANG receptor blocker saralasin and was completely abrogated by ANG1-7. Inhibition by ANG1-7 was blocked by the specific mas antagonist A779. These data show that ER stress-induced apoptosis is mediated by the autocrine ANGII/ANG1-7 system in human AECs and demonstrate effective blockade of SP-C mutation-induced apoptosis by ANG1-7. They also suggest that therapeutic strategies aimed at administering ANG1-7 or stimulating ACE-2 may hold potential for the management of ER stress-induced fibrotic lung disorders.",

Because the lower 95% CI limit for the difference between groups A and B of 3.96 mm Hg in SBP and 3.54 mm Hg in DBP was lower than that preestablished by the trial protocol (4 mm Hg), noninferiority of the test formulation was demonstrated compared with the reference formulation. For the secondary end points, there was no significant difference between groups in SBP and DBP during daytime or nighttime at the end of week 8.

Over the past few decades a number of clinical trials have confirmed that careful control of glycemia and blood pressure can reduce the risk of developing DR and control its progression. In recent years, many treatment options have been developed for clinical management of the complications of DR (e.g., proliferative DR and macular edema) using laser-based therapies, intravitreal corticosteroids and anti-vascular endothelial growth factors, and vitrectomy to remove scarring and hemorrhage, but all these have limited benefits. In this review, we highlight and discuss potential molecular targets and new approaches that have shown great promise for the treatment of DR. New drugs and strategies are based on targeting a number of hyperglycemia-induced metabolic stress pathways, oxidative stress and inflammatory pathways, the renin-angiotensin system, and neurodegeneration, in addition to the use of stem cells and ribonucleic acid interference (RNAi) technologies. At present, clinical trials of some of these newer drugs in humans are yet to begin or are in early stages. Together, the new therapeutic drugs and approaches discussed may control the incidence and progression of DR with greater efficacy and safety.", 
    "271": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) may induce an acute decrease of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in the stenotic kidney in renal artery stenosis, but most patients tolerate these drugs well. We hypothesized that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/ARBs stabilize stenotic kidney function during prolonged treatment by conferring protective effects. We tested this in control domestic pigs and pigs with renal artery stenosis untreated or treated with Valsartan, or triple therapy (seven pigs in each group) for 4 weeks starting 6 weeks after stenosis induction. Renal function, oxygenation, tubular function, and microcirculation were assessed by multi-detector computed tomography (CT), blood oxygen level-dependent magnetic-resonance imaging, and micro-CT. Valsartan and triple therapy decreased blood pressure similarly; however, Valsartan did not change the GFR of the stenotic kidney compared with renal artery stenosis and was similar to triple therapy. Both Valsartan and triple therapy stimulated microvascular density and improved tubular function. Valsartan also caused a greater increase of angiogenic factors and a decrease in oxidative stress, which were related to higher cortical perfusion and tubular response than triple therapy. Thus, Valsartan did not decrease stenotic kidney GFR, but improved cortical perfusion and microcirculation. These beneficial effects may partly offset the hemodynamic GFR reduction in renal artery stenosis and preserve kidney function.",

In this article, we differentiated persons with a European, African and Asian origin into three main groups. The combination of a fixed dose of isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine (known as BiDil) was marketed specifically in the US for Afro-Americans with heart failure, as patients from this group respond less well to ACE inhibitors. Ethnic differences in the effects of medications are partly linked to genetic variations. These ethnicity-related differences in the effects of medicines could be caused by variations in the enzymes that metabolise medications, e.g. cytochrome P450 (CYP) or, genetic variations in the receptors to which these substances bind. These differences could have consequences for dosing. Besides the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic differences, there are also ethnic differences related to undesirable effects: HLA-mediated hypersensitivity reactions, for example. Ethnicity is not a suitable basis for adjusting the dosages of medicines. Genotyping can prove helpful at times.",

In vitro release studies demonstrated controlled release for each formulation developed. In viro and ex vivo diffusion rate studies were performed through various synthetic membranes with different thickness, pore size and type (hydrophilic and hydrophobic) and through human skin by using Franz diffusion cells.

Currently used treatments include blood pressure control and the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), which can slow down the progression of CKD but are unable to halt or reverse it. Dietary protein restriction represents an additional therapeutic measure used to slow the progression of CKD. The putative mechanisms of action responsible for its therapeutic effects include beneficial hemodynamic effects and the limitation of absorbable protein breakdown products that could lead to the accumulation of uremic waste and consequent various deleterious effects. The practical implementation of protein restriction through dietary intervention has been hindered on multiple levels, including patient nonadherence, lack of health care resources, and concerns related to adverse effects associated with the development of protein-energy wasting (PEW). As a result, alternative interventions have been designed to address some or all of these shortcomings and concerns. One such intervention is the administration of medications that prevent the absorption of protein catabolic products from the gut. This article reviews the various interventions using such a strategy to prevent or slow the progression of CKD, with special focus on recent advances in this field.",

Speckle tracking promises new insights into ventricular function, aortic mechanics, and the interaction between these structures.", 
    "288": "In patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), the prevalence of increased blood pressure during sleep and blunted sleep-time-relative blood pressure decline (a nondipper pattern) is very high and increases substantially with disease severity. Elevated blood pressure during sleep is the major criterion for the diagnoses of hypertension and inadequate therapeutic ambulatory blood pressure control in these patients. Substantial, clinically meaningful ingestion-time-dependent differences in the safety, efficacy, duration of action and/or effects on the 24 h blood pressure pattern of six different classes of hypertension medications and their combinations have been substantiated. For example, bedtime ingestion of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers is more effective than morning ingestion in reducing blood pressure during sleep and converting the 24 h blood pressure profile into a dipper pattern. We have identified a progressive reduction in blood pressure during sleep--a novel therapeutic target best achieved by ingestion of one or more hypertension medications at bedtime--as the most significant predictor of decreased cardiovascular risk in patients with and without CKD. Recent findings suggest that in patients with CKD, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring should be used for the diagnosis of hypertension and assessment of cardiovascular disease risk, and that therapeutic strategies given at bedtime rather than on awakening are preferable for the management of hypertension.", 
    "289": "Dietary sodium, the main determinant of the pharmacodynamic response to renin-angiotensin system blockade, influences the pharmacokinetics of various cardiovascular drugs. We compared the effect of contrasted sodium diets on the pharmacokinetics of single oral doses of 8 mg candesartan cilexetil, 160 mg valsartan, 10 mg ramipril, and 50 mg atenolol administered to 64 (16 per group) normotensive male subjects randomly assigned to sodium depletion (SD) or sodium repletion (SR) in a crossover study. Pharmacodynamic response was assessed as the increase in plasma renin concentration for renin-angiotensin system blockers and electrocardiographic changes in PR interval duration for atenolol. The area under the curve (AUC) for plasma candesartan and atenolol concentrations was significantly lower for SR than for SD (respective ratios of AUC0-\u221e: 0.74; [90% CI, 0.66-0.82] and 0.69 [90% CI, 0.54-0.88], respectively), indicating a lack of bioequivalence between SR and SD. SR did not affect the pharmacokinetics of valsartan or ramipril. The increase in plasma renin concentration with the 3 renin-angiotensin system blockers was 10 times lower during the SR than the SD period. In the multiple regression analysis, the AUC0-24 of plasma drug concentration explained <1% and 21% of the variance of the AUC0-24 of delta plasma renin concentration for candesartan (P=0.8882/P=0.0368) during the SR and SD periods, respectively. The atenolol-induced lengthening of PR interval was fully reversed by SR. Thus, sodium balance modulates the pharmacokinetics of candesartan cilexetil and atenolol, with measurable effects on the selected pharmacodynamic end points.", 
    "290": "Diminished release and function of endothelium-derived nitric oxide coupled with increases in reactive oxygen species production is critical in endothelial dysfunction. Recent evidences have shown that activation of the protective axis of the renin-angiotensin system composed by angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, angiotensin-(1-7), and Mas receptor promotes many beneficial vascular effects. This has led us to postulate that activation of intrinsic angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 would improve endothelial function by decreasing the reactive oxygen species production. In the present study, we tested 1-[[2-(dimetilamino)etil]amino]-4-(hidroximetil)-7-[[(4-metilfenil)sulfonil]oxi]-9H-xantona-9 (XNT), a small molecule angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 activator, on endothelial function to validate this hypothesis. In vivo treatment with XNT (1 mg/kg per day for 4 weeks) improved the endothelial function of spontaneously hypertensive rats and of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats when evaluated through the vasorelaxant responses to acetylcholine/sodium nitroprusside. Acute in vitro incubation with XNT caused endothelial-dependent vasorelaxation in aortic rings of rats. This vasorelaxation effect was attenuated by the Mas antagonist D-pro7-Ang-(1-7), and it was reduced in Mas knockout mice. These effects were associated with reduction in reactive oxygen species production. In addition, Ang II-induced reactive oxygen species production in human aortic endothelial cells was attenuated by preincubation with XNT. These results showed that chronic XNT administration improves the endothelial function of hypertensive and diabetic rat vessels by attenuation of the oxidative stress. Moreover, XNT elicits an endothelial-dependent vasorelaxation response, which was mediated by Mas. Thus, this study indicated that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 activation promotes beneficial effects on the endothelial function and it is a potential target for treating cardiovascular disease.", 
    "291": "Cardiovascular risk factors lead to enhanced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by NADPH oxidase, xanthine oxidase (XO), the mitochondrial electron-transport chain (ETC), and dysfunctional endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). When the capacity of antioxidant defense systems [e.g., superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), heme oxygenase (HO), paraoxonase (PON)] is exceeded, this results in oxidative stress, which can promote atherogenesis. Therefore, pharmacological means to prevent oxidative stress are of major therapeutic interest. Some established drugs and novel therapeutic approaches can prevent oxidative stress and, presumably, vascular disease. These include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1 receptor) blockers (ARBs), statins, nebivolol, pentaerithrityl tetranitrate (PETN), resveratrol, and mitochondria-targeted antioxidants. Molecular mechanisms involved in the induction of oxidative stress under pathological conditions as well as pharmacological approaches (and their molecular mechanisms) are summarized in this review.",

We found that BK-induced dilation was diminished in the coronary arterioles of HFD rats, when compared with controls. When administered in vitro, the ACE inhibitor, captopril, restored the coronary dilation response to BK in HFD rats, but did not affect control responses. Abundant ACE expression was detected in coronary endothelium, which was associated with increased ACE activity in HFD arterioles, as measured by increased response to the ACE substrate, angiotensin I. Moreover, we found that in the coronary arterioles of obese patients, BK-induced dilation was augmented by in vitro captopril administration. Correspondingly, ACE activity was increased in the coronary arterioles of obese patients when compared with the non-obese. Logistic regression analysis revealed that obese patients taking ACE inhibitors prior to surgery exhibited an enhanced dilation response to BK.",

Loop diuretics are pivotal in the management of this common clinical problem. Although loop diuretics have been in clinical use since the 1960s, we still do not understand how to optimally administer these drugs. It is unknown why some decompensated heart failure patients exhibit improvements in renal function with diuresis, whereas others display renal function deterioration, limiting attainment of euvolemia. Here the physiologic interactions between the failing heart and kidneys are reviewed. A conceptual framework is presented that emphasizes the balance between tubuloglomerular feedback and venous congestion in determining renal function during loop diuretic use in heart failure. Within this framework, guidelines are derived that seek to maximize the chance for achieving adequate volume removal while maintaining stable or improved renal function during the treatment of acute decompensated heart failure.", 
    "316": "The widely reported stimulation of the cardiac Na(+)-K(+) pump by protein kinase A (PKA) should oppose other effects of PKA to increase contractility of the normal heart. It should also reduce harmful raised myocyte Na(+) levels in heart failure, yet blockade of the \u03b21 adrenergic receptor (AR), coupled to PKA signalling, is beneficial. We treated rabbits with the \u03b21 AR antagonist metoprolol to modulate PKA activity and studied cardiac myocytes ex vivo. Metoprolol increased electrogenic pump current (Ip) in voltage clamped myocytes and reduced glutathionylation of the \u03b21 pump subunit, an oxidative modification causally related to pump inhibition. Activation of adenylyl cyclase with forskolin to enhance cAMP synthesis or inclusion of the catalytic subunit of PKA in patch pipette solutions abolished the increase in Ip in voltage clamped myocytes induced by treatment with metoprolol, supporting cAMP/PKA-mediated pump inhibition. Metoprolol reduced myocardial PKA and protein kinase C (PKC) activities, reduced coimmunoprecipitation of cytosolic p47(phox) and membranous p22(phox) NADPH oxidase subunits and reduced myocardial O2(\u2022-)-sensitive dihydroethidium fluorescence. Treatment also enhanced coimmunoprecipitation of the \u03b21 pump subunit with glutaredoxin 1 that catalyses de-glutathionylation. Since angiotensin II induces PKC-dependent activation of NADPH oxidase, we examined the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition with captopril. This treatment had no effect on PKA activity but reduced the activity of PKC, reduced \u03b21 subunit glutathionylation and increased Ip. The PKA-induced Na(+)-K(+) pump inhibition we report should act with other mechanisms that enhance contractility of the normal heart but accentuate the harmful effects of raised cytosolic Na(+) in the failing heart. This scheme is consistent with the efficacy of \u03b21 AR blockade in the treatment of heart failure.", 
    "317": "Ageing is a progressive process that according to available knowledge cannot be effectively reversed, slowed or stopped. Here we propose a new anti-ageing approach that may lead to the design of effective therapeutic intervention. First, we hypothesize that the \"organ system\" oriented anti-ageing approach represents a better anti-ageing target than the \"whole body\" or \"cellular ageing\" concepts. The arterial system is the most suitable target, as it interconnects all the organs in the body, thus influencing them all. Second, we propose that an anti-ageing approach could be more successful in early than late ageing stages; middle-aged people seem to be the most appropriate candidates. Third, we believe that instead of searching for new medication, we should rely on already established medications with beneficial effects on the arterial wall. Renin-angiotensin system inhibitors and statins fulfill these criteria and are potential cornerstones of the new approach. The fourth hypothesis is based on the concept that in the early stages of arterial ageing only slight injury is present and therefore subtherapeutic, low-dose treatment would be effective. Fifth, we hypothesize that slight initial age-related arterial wall changes are reversible and could be corrected by a short-term (one month) treatment. Sixth, we hypothesize that the effects would be present for a certain period of time even after treatment termination. The listed assumptions combined represent the basis for a new, original anti-ageing approach - a subtherapeutic low-dose combination of a renin-angiotensin system inhibitor and a statin for one month (followed by approximately 6-12 months without treatment) could delay or even reverse the arterial ageing process and consequently decrease the incidence of cardiovascular disorders.",

In the present post hoc analysis, we evaluated whether B+A is more effective than B+H for reducing CV events in patients with known coronary artery disease (CAD) at baseline in a subgroup analysis of the Avoiding Cardiovascular events through COMbination therapy in Patients LIving with Systolic Hypertension (ACCOMPLISH) study. The main trial randomized 11,506 patients. Of those, 5,744 received B+A and 5,762 received B+H. Of the 11,506 patients, 5,314 (46%) were classified as having CAD at baseline. The mean patient follow-up period was 35.7 months for the B+A group and 35.6 months for the B+H group. The primary end point was the interval to the first event of composite CV morbidity and mortality. At baseline, significant differences were present between the 5,314 with CAD and the 6,192 without CAD. The patients with CAD had a lower systolic blood pressure and heart rate, a lower incidence of diabetes, and greater incidence of dyslipidemia. However, no baseline differences were found between the randomized B+A and B+H groups. In the patients with CAD, an 18% reduction occurred in the hazard ratio for CV events (primary end point) with B+A versus B+H (p\u00a0= 0.0016).

Deficiency or malfunction of the serine protease inhibitor C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH) results in HAE types 1 and 2, respectively, whereas mutations in coagulation factor 12 (f12) have been associated with HAE type 3. C1-INH is the primary inhibitor of multiple plasma cascade pathways known to be altered in HAE patients, including the complement, fibrinolytic, coagulation, and kinin-kallikrein pathways. We have selectively inhibited several components of both the kinin-kallikrein system and the coagulation cascades with potent and selective antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to investigate their relative contributions to vascular permeability. We have also developed ASO inhibitors of C1-INH and characterized their effects on vascular permeability in mice as an inducible model of HAE. Our studies demonstrate that ASO-mediated reduction in C1-INH plasma levels results in increased vascular permeability and that inhibition of proteases of the kinin-kallikrein system, either f12 or prekallikrein (PKK) reverse the effects of C1-INH depletion with similar effects on both basal and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-induced permeability. In contrast, inhibition of coagulation factors 11 (f11) or 7 (f7) had no effect. These results suggest that the vascular defects observed in C1-INH deficiency are dependent on the kinin-kallikrein system proteases f12 and PKK, and not mediated through the coagulation pathways. In addition, our results highlight a novel therapeutic modality that can potentially be employed prophylactically to prevent attacks in HAE patients.",

Prospective randomized clinical trials are currently underway utilizing dosing algorithms that incorporate genetic polymorphisms in cytochrome P450 (CYP)2C9 and vitamin k epoxide reductase (VKORC1) to determine warfarin dosages. Polymorphisms in CYP2C9 and VKORC1 account for approximately 40\u00a0% of the variance in warfarin dose. There is currently significant controversy with regards to pharmacogenetic testing in anti-platelet therapy. Inhibition of platelet aggregation by aspirin in vitro has been associated with polymorphisms in the cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-1 gene. However, COX-1 polymorphisms did not affect clinical outcomes in patients prescribed aspirin therapy. Similarly, CYP2C19 polymorphisms have been associated with clopidogrel resistance in vitro, and have shown an association with stent thrombosis, but not with other cardiovascular outcomes in a consistent manner. Response to statins has been associated with polymorphisms in the cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP), apolipoprotein E (APOE), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, calmin (CLMN) and apolipoprotein-CI (APOC1) genes. Although these genes contribute to the variation in lipid levels during statin therapy, their effects on cardiovascular outcomes requires further investigation. Polymorphisms in the solute carrier organic anion transporter 1B1 (SLCO1B1) gene is associated with increased statin exposure and simvastatin-induced myopathy. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonists (\u03b2-blockers) are medications that are important in the management of hypertension and heart failure. Insertion and deletion polymorphisms in the ACE gene are associated with elevated and reduced serum levels of ACE, respectively. No significant association was reported between the polymorphism and blood pressure reduction in patients treated with perindopril. However, a pharmacogenetic score incorporating single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the bradykinin type 1 receptor gene and angiotensin-II type I receptor gene predicted those most likely to benefit and suffer harm from perindopril therapy. Pharmacogenetic studies into \u03b2-blocker therapy have focused on variations in the \u03b21-adrenoceptor gene and CYP2D6, but results have been inconsistent. Pharmacogenetic testing for ACE inhibitor and \u03b2-blocker therapy is not currently used in clinical practice. Despite extensive research, no pharmacogenetic tests are currently in clinical practice for cardiovascular medicines. Much of the research remains in the discovery phase, with researchers struggling to demonstrate clinical utility and validity. This is a problem seen in many areas of therapeutics and is because of many factors, including poor study design, inadequate sample sizes, lack of replication, and heterogeneity amongst patient populations and phenotypes. In order to progress pharmacogenetics in cardiovascular therapies, researchers need to utilize next-generation sequencing technologies, develop clear phenotype definitions and engage in multi-center collaborations, not only to obtain larger sample sizes but to replicate associations and confirm results across different ethnic groups.",

    "349": "Substantial morbidity, mortality, and costs are associated with progressive diabetic kidney disease (DKD). A goal of Healthy People 2020 is to reduce kidney disease attributable to diabetes mellitus and increase the proportion of patients who receive agents that interrupt the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). The mechanisms that contribute to progressive loss of kidney function in patients with diabetes are disrupted by inhibition of the RAS. ACEIs, ARBs and direct renin inhibitors (DRIs) all reduce the effect of angiotensin II, yet each works through a different mechanism and displays properties that may or may not be replicated by the others. As single agents, RAS inhibitors and blockers have been shown to slow the rate of progression of DKD and to reduce new cases of end-stage renal disease in various subsets of patients with diabetes and proteinuria (e.g., albuminuria). However, even with contemporary use of ACEIs, ARBs, and, more recently, DRIs, the burden of kidney disease remains high. Thus investigators sought to explore the utility of combining agents (e.g., dual RAS therapy) in various regimens for cardiovascular and kidney end points. Recent data from the Ongoing Telmisartan Alone and in Combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET) and Aliskiren Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Using Cardio-Renal Endpoints (ALTITUDE) studies suggest that kidney-related outcomes (composite of dialysis initiation, doubling serum creatinine concentration, or death) were increased with ACEI plus ARB or DRI plus ARB combinations. Consequently, dual therapy should not be routinely prescribed in patients with diabetes until further data become available from other future studies. This review provides an introduction to DKD and a rationale for using RAS inhibition; discusses screening, detection, and monitoring of patients with DKD; and summarizes results from meta-analyses and critical reviews and from recent large randomized controlled studies published since the meta-analyses or reviews. Finally, we suggest a clinical approach for using RAS agents in patients with DKD.",

Cross-sectionally, there was no difference in the number of AD cases between ApoE4 carriers and ApoE4 non-carriers or between ACE inhibitor users and non-users in the homebound elderly. ApoE4 carriers treated with ACE inhibitors, however, had more diagnoses of AD compared with those who did not have the treatment (28% versus 6%, p\u00a0= 0.01) or ApoE4 non-carriers treated with an ACE inhibitor (28% versus 10%, p\u00a0= 0.03). ACE inhibitor use was associated with AD diagnosis only in the presence of an E4 allele.

In this study, we used CE-TOF-MS for separation and identification of bioactive peptides in three hypoallergenic infant milk formulas. An appropriate sample cleanup using a citrate buffer with DTT and urea followed by SPE with Sep-Pack\u00ae C18 and StrataX\u2122 cartridges allowed the detection of a large number of low molecular mass bioactive peptides. This preliminary identification was solely based on the measured experimental monoisotopic molecular mass values (M(exp)).

The assistance of migration prediction proved to be useful to improve reliability of the identification, avoiding misinterpretations and solving some identity conflicts. After revision, the identity of 24, 30, and 38 bioactive peptides was confirmed in each of the three infant milk formulas.

Secondary disease prevention is an important component of survivorship care that has not been previously evaluated. Our aims were (1) to assess the utilization of and adherence to medications and treatments for the secondary prevention of myocardial infarction (MI) in CS versus non-cancer patients (NCP) and (2) to compare temporal trends in cardiovascular care between these two patient cohorts. Linking data from Medicare, pharmacy assistance programs, and cancer registries, we calculated the percentage of individuals receiving preventive medications (statins, \u03b2-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) and revascularization interventions (angioplasty, stent, bypass surgery) within 90 days after acute MI in CS and propensity score-matched NCP. We assessed trends over time and determined predictors of appropriate preventive care using modified Poisson regression. We identified 1,119 CS and 7,886 NCP. Compared to NCP, more survivors received statins (38 vs. 31 %) and \u03b2-blockers (67 vs. 59 %), but fewer underwent bypass surgery (1.5 vs. 2.8 %) after MI. From 1997 to 2004, both survivors and NCP were increasingly prescribed medications to prevent future coronary events. Over the same time period, receipt of bypass surgery was significantly lower among survivors. Co-morbidities, such as depression and lung disease, and demographic factors, such as advanced age and female, were associated with underuse of preventive care among survivors when compared to NCP. Use of preventive medications and procedures has generally improved, but uptake of bypass surgery among CS still lags behind NCP.", 
    "363": "Although the focus of therapeutic intervention has been on neurohormonal pathways thought to be harmful in heart failure (HF), such as the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), potentially beneficial counter-regulatory systems are also active in HF. These promote vasodilatation and natriuresis, inhibit abnormal growth, suppress the RAAS and sympathetic nervous system, and augment parasympathetic activity. The best understood of these mediators are the natriuretic peptides which are metabolized by the enzyme neprilysin.

    "367": "Amyloid-\u03b2 protein (A\u03b2) varies in length at its carboxyl terminus. The longer A\u03b2 species, A\u03b243 and A\u03b242, are highly amyloidogenic and deposit more frequently than A\u03b240 in the brain of Alzheimer disease (AD) patients. However, the characterization of A\u03b243 deposition in the brain and the relationship between A\u03b243 and A\u03b242 or A\u03b240 remain unclear. We provide evidence that A\u03b243 deposition appears earlier than A\u03b242 and A\u03b240 deposition in the brain of mutant amyloid precursor protein transgenic (APPtg) mice, suggesting that A\u03b243 is the earliest-depositing species. In addition, we found increased A\u03b243 levels and A\u03b243/A\u03b242 ratios in the serum of AD patients, suggesting their use as diagnostic blood biomarkers for AD. We further show that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) converts A\u03b243 to A\u03b241. Notably, this A\u03b243-to-A\u03b241 converting activity requires two active domains of ACE. Inhibition of ACE activity significantly enhanced A\u03b243 deposition in APPtg mouse brain. Our results suggest that A\u03b243 is the earliest-depositing species in brain parenchyma and that A\u03b243 may trigger later A\u03b242 and A\u03b240 deposition or may be converted to A\u03b242 and A\u03b240 plaques. Activities of both ACE domains may be important for reducing A\u03b243 levels in serum and reducing brain A\u03b243 deposition.", 
    "368": "The potential of bovine lactoferrin (LF) as a source of antihypertensive peptides acting on the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and the endothelin (ET) system as dual vasopeptidase inhibitors has been examined. For this purpose enzymatic LF hydrolyzates (LFHs) were generated by trypsin and proteinase K digestions. Permeate fractions with molecular masses lower than 3 kDa (LFH <3 kDa) were orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Although both LFHs <3 kDa showed in vitro angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity, only proteinase K LFH <3 kDa exerted an in vivo antihypertensive effect. The proteinase K LFH <3 kDa and a previously characterized pepsin LFH <3 kDa with ACE-inhibitory and antihypertensive effects were tested in ex vivo functional assays as inhibitors of ACE-dependent vasoconstriction. Pepsin LFH <3 kDa but not proteinase K LFH <3 kDa inhibited ACE-dependent vasoconstriction. When tested as inhibitors towards endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE), both LFHs <3 kDa exerted in vitro inhibitory effects on ECE activity and inhibited ECE-dependent vasoconstriction. Most abundant peptides in proteinase K LFH <3 kDa were identified by using an ion trap mass spectrometer. Based on peptide abundance, two peptides (GILRPY and REPYFGY) were chemically synthesized and their ECE-inhibitory activity was tested. Both exerted in vitro inhibitory effects on ECE activity. In conclusion, orally effective antihypertensive LFHs <3 kDa may act as dual vasopeptidase (ACE/ECE) or as single ECE inhibitors with different antivasoconstrictor effects depending on the protease used to release bioactive peptide sequences.",

In addition, the effects of digestion on the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activities of these extracts were evaluated. The extracts were digested with a mixture of pepsin-HCl for 2 h, followed by a 2 h incubation with pancreatin and bile salts including a cellulose dialysis tubing (molecular weight cut-off 12 kDa) at 37\u00b0C with shaking in the dark and under N2. Under gastric conditions, the mean degree of polymerisation (mDP) of seed extracts, raw (mDP\u22486, p<0.05), and purified (mDP\u224810, p<0.05) was stable. The mDP of the raw skin extracts increased from 19 to 25 towards the end of the digestion. The PAs were significantly degraded (up to 80%) during the pancreatic digestion, yielding low-molecular-weight compounds that diffused into the serum-available fraction (mDP\u22482). The overall mass transfer coefficient (K) of the seed extracts was 10(-7) m(2)/s. After simulated gastrointestinal digestion, over 80% of ACE inhibition by raw seed and skin extracts was preserved. However, the purified seed and skin extracts lost their ability to inhibit ACE after intestinal digestion.",

Olmesartan is an effective and safe antihypertensive agent, but special attention should be paid to high-risk patients, such as those with coronary disease, to avoid an excessive reduction in blood pressure. The authors also note that while azilsartan is probably the most potent ARB, there is still a lack of data regarding potential organ damage and the incidence of cardiovascular events. Lastly, recent evidence has shown a lack of a relationship between ARB therapy and the occurrence of cancer.", 
    "373": "Inflammation is an integral part of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the most prevalent form of hepatic pathology found in the general population. In this context, recently we have examined the potential role of Glutaminyl Cyclases (QC and isoQC), and their inhibitors, in the maturation of chemokines, for example, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1, CCL2), to generate their bioactive conformation. Catalysis by isoQC leads to the formation of an N-terminal pyroglutamate residue protecting CCL2 against degradation by aminopeptidases. This is of importance because truncated forms possess a reduced potential to attract immune cells. Since liver inflammation is characterized by the up-regulation of different chemokine pathways, and within this CCL2 is known to be a prominent example, we hypothesised that application of QC/isoQC inhibitors may alleviate liver inflammation by destabilizing CCL2. Therefore, we investigated the role of QC/isoQC inhibition, in comparison with the angiotensin receptor blocker Telmisartan, during development of pathology in a mouse model of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Application of a QC/isoQC inhibitor led to a significant reduction in circulating alanine aminotransferase and NAFLD activity score accompanied by an inhibitory effect on hepatocyte ballooning. Further analysis revealed a specific reduction of inflammation by decreasing the number of F4/80-positive macrophages, which is in agreement with the proposed CCL2-related mechanism of action of QC/isoQC inhibitors. Finally, QC/isoQC inhibitor application attenuated liver fibrosis as characterized by reduced collagen deposition in the liver parenchyma. Thus in conclusion, QC/isoQC inhibitors are a promising novel class of anti-non-alcoholic steatohepatitis drugs which have a comparable disease-modifying effect to that of Telmisartan, which is probably mediated via specific interference with a comparable monocyte/macrophage infiltration that occurs under inflammatory conditions.",

A novel heterozygous splice site mutation of intron 25 - IVS25+1G>A (c.3691+1G>A) - cosegregating with elevated plasma ACE was identified in both pedigrees. Messenger RNA analysis revealed that the mutation led to the retention of intron 25 and Premature Termination Codon generation. Subjects harboring the mutation were mostly normotensive, had no left ventricular hypertrophy or cardiovascular disease. The levels of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system components in the mutated cases and wild-type controls were similar, both at baseline and after 50 mg captopril. Compared with non-affected members, quantification of ACE surface expression and shedding using flow cytometry assay of dendritic cells derived from peripheral blood monocytes of affected members, demonstrated a 50% decrease and 3-fold increase, respectively.

    "377": "The Connectivity Map database contains microarray signatures of gene expression derived from approximately 6000 experiments that examined the effects of approximately 1300 single drugs on several human cancer cell lines. We used these data to prioritize pairs of drugs expected to reverse the changes in gene expression observed in the kidneys of a mouse model of HIV-associated nephropathy (Tg26 mice). We predicted that the combination of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and a histone deacetylase inhibitor would maximally reverse the disease-associated expression of genes in the kidneys of these mice. Testing the combination of these inhibitors in Tg26 mice revealed an additive renoprotective effect, as suggested by reduction of proteinuria, improvement of renal function, and attenuation of kidney injury. Furthermore, we observed the predicted treatment-associated changes in the expression of selected genes and pathway components. In summary, these data suggest that the combination of an ACE inhibitor and a histone deacetylase inhibitor could have therapeutic potential for various kidney diseases.

Cox proportional hazards models were used for model development. The end points examined were cardiovascular mortality, noncardiovascular mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass grafting, percutaneous coronary intervention, resuscitated cardiac arrest, and combinations of these end points. The performance measures included Nagelkerke's R\u00b2, time-dependent area under the receiver operating characteristic curves, and calibration plots. Backward selection resulted in a prediction model for cardiovascular mortality (464 events) containing age, current smoking, diabetes mellitus, total cholesterol, body mass index, previous myocardial infarction, history of congestive heart failure, peripheral vessel disease, previous revascularization, and previous stroke. The model performance was adequate for this end point, with a Nagelkerke R\u00b2 of 12%, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.73. However, the performance of models constructed for nonfatal and combined end points was considerably worse, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of about 0.6. In conclusion, in patients with established coronary artery disease, the risk of cardiovascular mortality during longer term follow-up can be adequately predicted using the clinical characteristics available at baseline. However, the prediction of nonfatal outcomes, both separately and combined with fatal outcomes, poses major challenges for clinicians and model developers.",

Patients with scleroderma renal crisis (SRC), which is usually characterized by severe hypertension, progressive decline of renal function and thrombotic microangiopathy, show a significant benefit of early angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor use in particular and strict blood pressure control in general. Treatment of the underlying autoimmune disorder or discontinuation of specific therapeutic agents improves kidney function in most patients with Sj\u00f6gren syndrome, auto-immune myopathies, APSN and RA.In this review we focus on impairment of renal function in relation to underlying disease or adverse drug effects and implications on treatment decisions.",

Its estimated prevalence is expected to double within the next 50\u00a0years. During the past decade, there have been significant advances in the treatment of AF. Studies have demonstrated that a rate control strategy, with a target resting heart rate between 80 and 100\u00a0beats/minute, is recommended over rhythm control in the vast majority of patients. The CHA2 DS2 \u2265 (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age \u2265 65 yrs, diabetes mellitus, stroke or transient ischemic attack, vascular disease, female gender) scoring system is a potentially useful stroke risk stratification tool that incorporates additional risk factors to the commonly used CHADS2 (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age \u2265 75 years, diabetes mellitus, stroke transient ischemic attack) scoring tool. Similarly, a convenient scheme, termed HAS-BLED (hypertension, abnormal renal/liver function, stroke, bleeding history or predisposition, labile international normalized ratio, elderly, drugs/alcohol concomitantly), to assess bleeding risk has emerged that may be useful in select patients. Furthermore, new antithrombotic strategies have been developed as potential alternatives to warfarin, including dual-antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel plus aspirin and the development of new oral anticoagulants such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban. Vernakalant has emerged as another potential option for pharmacologic conversion of AF, whereas recent trials have better defined the role of dronedarone in the maintenance of sinus rhythm. Finally, catheter ablation represents another alternative to manage AF, whereas upstream therapy with inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, statins, and polyunsaturated fatty acids could potentially prevent the occurrence of AF. Despite substantial progress in the management of AF, significant uncertainty surrounds the optimal treatment of this condition.",

In spite of proven benefits of hypertension treatment, blood pressure control rates are poor, even in high-income countries with virtually full-access to therapies. Nearly 75% of hypertensive patients do not achieve adequate control with monotherapy, thus needing combination treatment. Strategies to improve blood pressure control include the prompt shift from monotherapy to combination therapy, the initial treatment with a two-drug combination, and the use of fixed-dose combinations in a single pill. Currently, preferred combinations include a renin-angiotensin blocker, either an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin-receptor blocker plus a calcium channel blocker or a diuretic.

A 68-year-old male with a history of ESRD secondary to diabetes presented with erythrocytosis that started a few months after initiating dialysis in the absence of having received erythropoietin-stimulating agents or iron supplements. His erythropoietin level was elevated, with a negative JAK2 mutation. Blood gases showed normal oxygen and CO(2), with slightly elevated carboxyhemoglobin. Tiny foci in both kidneys were noted, representing vascular calcifications or renolithiasis. There was no radiological evidence of neoplasms or cysts. After excluding secondary causes, a diagnosis of idiopathic erythrocytosis was made. The patient underwent intermittent phlebotomies during dialysis, and his hemoglobin went from 18.5 to 14 mg/dl. Erythrocytosis in ESRD patients is very rare. So far, there is no complete understanding of the underlying pathophysiology; however, there seem to be multiple possible reasons for an increased erythropoietin level. Phlebotomy is a successful and easy way to control erythrocytosis in such patients. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, currently being used in posttransplant erythrocytosis, might also be considered.",

Seventy eight patients received enalapril (starting dose 2.5 mg twice daily with subsequent titration up to 10-20 mg twice daily). Control group comprised 136 patients without cardiovascular abnormalities. Allele D of polymorphic locus I/D of ACE gene in homozygous state was associated with high risk of development and severity of clinical manifestations of CHF. In patients with D/D genotype of ACE gene at the background of therapy with enelapril we noted more pronounced lowering of CHF functional class and augmentation of left ventricular ejection fraction compared with patients having I/I and I/D genotypes.

Arterial hypertension (AH) is the most common risk factor in patients with metabolic disorders. In the selection of antihypertensive therapy it is necessary to consider not only the anti-hypertensive and organoprotective effects of drugs and their metabolic effects, which has prognostic value. Calcium antagonists, along with inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and sartans have favorable metabolic effects. Lercanidipine related to the third generation dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, has been much more selective for the so-called slow calcium channels of vascular smooth muscle cells, which is associated with a good hypotensive, organo and metabolic action. Combination therapy with an ACE inhibitor and a calcium channel blocker, or angiotensin receptor blockers and calcium channel II is also a justified tactic for the management of patients with high-risk cardiovascular and metabolic disorders.",

The most typical manifestation of cardiotoxicity is a hypokinetic cardiomyopathy leading to heart failure. However, the spectrum of the toxic effects that can impair the cardiovascular system may also include acute coronary syndromes, hypertension, arrhythmias, and thromboembolic events. Patients undergoing cancer treatment are more vulnerable to cardiovascular injuries, and their risk of premature cardiovascular disease and death is higher than that of the general population. Prevention of cardiotoxicity remains the most important strategy, and several measures, including cardiac function monitoring, limitation of chemotherapy dose, use of anthracycline analogues and cardioprotectants, and early detection of myocardial cell injury by biomarkers, have been proposed. The response to modern heart failure therapy of cancer treatment-induced cardiomyopathy has never been evaluated in clinical trials, and currently there are no definitive guidelines. Although it is likely that medications used for other forms of cardiomyopathy, particularly angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and \u03b2-blockers, may be highly effective, there is still some unjustified concern regarding their use in cancer patients.

Historically, antiplatelet agents, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, \u03b2-blockers, and statins have been all proposed as drugs conferring anti-ischemic cardioprotection. This was supported by the evidence consistently indicating that all these drugs were capable of reducing mortality and the risk of repeat myocardial infarction. The electrical plasticity paradigm is, however, a novel concept that depicts the benefits of improved sodium channel blockade with drugs such as ranolazine and cariporide. Although it has been hypothesized that the protective role of ranolazine depends on decreased fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation affecting preconditioning, we speculate against such a hypothesis, because inhibition of \u03b2-oxidation requires higher concentrations of the drug, above the therapeutic range. Rather, we discuss the key role of calcium overload reduction through inhibition of the late sodium current (I(Na)). Mechanisms driving cardioprotection involve the block of a cascade of complex ionic exchanges that can result in intracellular acidosis, excess cytosolic calcium, myocardial cellular dysfunction, and eventually cell injury and death. In this review we discuss the studies that demonstrate how electrical plasticity through sodium channel blockers can promote cardioprotection against ischemia in coronary heart disease.",

Secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality, stroke, combined cardiovascular disease (coronary heart disease death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, angina, coronary revascularization, heart failure [HF], or peripheral vascular disease), and end-stage renal disease. In-trial rates of HF, stroke, and combined cardiovascular disease were significantly higher for lisinopril compared with chlorthalidone, and rates of HF were significantly higher for amlodipine compared with chlorthalidone in both men and women. There were no significant treatment sex interactions. These findings did not persist through the extension period with the exception of the HF result for amlodipine versus chlorthalidone, which did not differ significantly by sex. For both women and men, rates were not lower in the amlodipine or lisinopril groups than in the chlorthalidone group for either the primary coronary heart disease outcome or any other cardiovascular disease outcome, and chlorthalidone-based treatment resulted in the lowest risk of HF.

Rats underwent 5/6 nephrectomy (5/6Nx) and were treated with PKI-166, lisinopril or vehicle from week 6 after disease induction until week 12. Sham animals received either PKI-166 or vehicle. Treatment with PKI-166 did not affect the development of the characteristic renal features in 5/6Nx, including proteinuria, diminished creatinine clearance, and increased glomerulosclerosis, whereas these were attenuated by lisinopril. Despite absence of effects on progressive renal damage, PKI-166 attenuated the progression of hypertension and maintained cardiac function (left ventricle end-diastolic pressure) to a similar extent as lisinopril. Also, PKI-166 attenuated the increase in phosphorylated EGFR in the heart as induced by 5/6Nx. Moreover, PKI-166 and lisinopril restored the impaired contraction of isolated thoracic aortic rings to phenylephrine and angiotensin II and impaired myogenic constriction of small mesenteric arteries in 5/6Nx rats.

The most frequent and typical clinical manifestation of cardiotoxicity is left ventricular dysfunction, induced not only by cytotoxic conventional cancer therapy like anthracyclines, but also by new antitumor targeted therapy such as trastuzumab. The current standard for monitoring cardiac function, based on periodic assessment of left ventricular ejection fraction detects cardiotoxicity only when a functional impairment has already occurred, precluding any chance of preventing its development. A novel approach, based on the use of cardiac biomarkers has emerged in the last decade, resulting in a cost-effective diagnostic tool for early, real-time identification, assessment and monitoring of cardiotoxicity. In particular, prophylactic treatment with enalapril in patients with an early increase in troponin after chemotherapy has been shown to be very effective in preventing left ventricular dysfunction and associated cardiac events. In patients developing cancer treatment induced-cardiomyopathy, complete left ventricular ejection fraction recovery and a reduction of cardiac events may be achieved only when left ventricular dysfunction is detected early after the end of cancer treatment and treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, possibly in combination with beta-blockers, is promptly initiated.",

In aging societies, their prevalence sharply rises with age. Thus, diuretic efficacy and safety need to be considered in the elderly as main consumers. Diuretics expose several disadvantages with particular relevance for the elderly. The most acknowledged side effects concern electrolyte disturbances. Hypokalemia (up to 8%) may not only precipitate cardiac arrhythmias and related sudden death but also adynamia by muscular weakness. Hyponatremia (up to 17%) may contribute to confusion, delirium, and irreversible brain damage adding to age-related dementia. Thiazides are the antihypertensive drugs with the strongest diabetogenic activity. In heart failure treatment, overdosing of diuretics is common, as doses often reflect requirements for acute recompensation, which is two- to threefold the requirement of that in maintenance therapy. Trial data demonstrate a positive correlation between mortality and diuretic use/dose, which may also be related to volume contraction, related ACE-inhibitor intolerance, renal impairment, and venous thromboembolism. Combining loop and thiazide diuretics may be indicated for severe cardiac or renal failure, but it is also excessively used in less severe stages, causing an even more severe threat to patients; thiazides are often added unintentionally if overlooked in combination pills. Diuretics may be used to treat peripheral \"edema\" in obese patients, patients on calcium antagonists, or those with venous thrombotic disease. Here they are not indicated and may even induce edema. In statistics on adverse drug reactions leading to hospitalization, diuretics are among the 5 leading drug classes. Misleading interpretations of clinical trials and their low cost have pushed them into the front position of hypertension treatment. Here, side effects, including the urge of voiding, lead to the lowest adherence rate among first-line antihypertensives. It is proposed to term the syndrome of inappropriate diuretic application \"morbus diureticus.\" It should be diagnosed by history taking, force assessment (timed-up-and-go, chair-rise tests), clinical hydration assessment, and laboratory tests (electrolytes, creatinine). In heart failure, dose reductions/step-down from loop to thiazide diuretics should be tested routinely at 3- to 6-month intervals. In hypertension treatment, diuretics should be third in line if control by RAS inhibitors and long-acting dihydropyridine calcium antagonists is insufficient. If symptoms improve after diuretic step-down (including improved tolerance to RAS inhibitors or renal function), this diagnosis may also be made \"ex juvantibus.\"",

Epidemiologic reports of patients with GCA suggest that long-term mortality in this disease is not increased compared with the general population of the same age. The risk of a stroke, however, in particular in the vertebrobasilar territory, is increased. In addition, the occurrence of aortic aneurysmal disease and aortic dissection is also clearly increased in GCA. Mortality due to ischaemic heart disease, however, is not increased. In Takayasu arteritis accelerated atherosclerosis has been clearly documented both clinically and in autopsy reports. Atherosclerotic plaques in the carotid artery may be present in the carotid arteries especially in patients with a documented history of arteritis involving the carotid artery. It is controversial whether Kawasaki disease is associated with accelerated atherosclerosis. Young adults with a history of Kawasaki disease may have abnormal brachial artery reactivity, increased carotid IMT values and increased arterial stiffness. At autopsy examinations of KD patients, however, no significant atherosclerotic lesions are detected and carotid IMT measurements were found to be clearly different from those in young adults with familiar hypercholesterolaemia, suggesting that the remodeling process in KD is different from atherosclerosis. In ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV), an increased mortality as a consequence of cardiovascular disease is well-documented. In these patients the relative risk for coronary heart disease is two- to fourfold that in control subjects. In addition, a similar relative risk has been found for stroke. Diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, abdominal obesity (metabolic syndrome), impaired renal function, persistent proteinuria and increased production of C-reactive protein are common risk factors for premature atherosclerosis in patients with systemic vasculitis. Furthermore, cholesterol and its modifications play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of accelerated atherosclerosis in vasculitis. The (preventive) therapy for accelerated atherosclerosis in systemic vasculitis is based on an aggressive approach against inflammation and against risk factors of premature atherosclerosis such as smoking, inactivity, obesity and unhealthy diet. In addition, patients should be treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin receptor-1 blockers for hypertension and statins for dyslipidemia. Finally, low dose acetylsalicylic acid should be prescribed in patients with large vessel vasculitis, i.e., both in GCA and TA, who do not have contraindications for ASA.", 
    "545": "The members of the organic anion transporting polypeptide superfamily (OATPs) are classified within the SLCO solute carrier family. All functionally well characterized members are predicted to have 12 transmembrane domains and are sodium-independent transport systems that mediate the transport of a broad range of endo- as well as xenobiotics. Substrates are mainly amphipathic organic anions with a molecular weight of more than 300Da, but some of the known transported substrates are also neutral or even positively charged. Among the well characterized substrates are numerous drugs including statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, antibiotics, antihistaminics, antihypertensives and anticancer drugs. Based on their amino acid sequence identities, the different OATPs cluster into families (in general with more than 40% amino acid sequence identity) and subfamilies (more than 60% amino acid identity). With the sequencing of genomes from different species and the computerized prediction of encoded proteins more than 300 OATPs can be found in the databases, however only a fraction of them have been identified in humans, rodents, and some additional species important for pharmaceutical research like the rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta), the dog (Canis lupus familiaris) and the pig (Sus scrofa). These OATPs form 6 families (OATP1-OATP6) and 13 subfamilies. In this review we try to summarize what is currently known about OATPs with respect to endogenous substrates, tissue distribution, transport mechanisms, regulation of expression, structure-function relationship and mutations and polymorphisms.", 
    "546": "Mammalian members of the proton-coupled oligopeptide transporter family (SLC15) are integral membrane proteins that mediate the cellular uptake of di/tripeptides and peptide-like drugs. The driving force for uphill electrogenic symport is the chemical gradient and membrane potential which favors proton uptake into the cell along with the peptide/mimetic substrate. The peptide transporters are responsible for the absorption and conservation of dietary protein digestion products in the intestine and kidney, respectively, and in maintaining homeostasis of neuropeptides in the brain. They are also responsible for the absorption and disposition of a number of pharmacologically important compounds including some aminocephalosporins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, antiviral prodrugs, and others. In this review, we provide updated information on the structure-function of PepT1 (SLC15A1), PepT2 (SLC15A2), PhT1 (SLC15A4) and PhT2 (SLC15A3), and their expression and localization in key tissues. Moreover, mammalian peptide transporters are discussed in regard to pharmacogenomic and regulatory implications on host pharmacology and disease, and as potential targets for drug delivery. Significant emphasis is placed on the evolving role of these peptide transporters as elucidated by studies using genetically modified animals. Whenever possible, the relevance of drug-drug interactions and regulatory mechanisms are evaluated using in vivo studies.",

It is unknown if renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers are beneficial in this setting. We retrospectively analyzed 94 adults who received single kidneys from donors <10\u00a0years old during 1996-2009. The recipients were divided into group 1 with RAS blockers (n\u00a0=\u00a040) and group 2 without RAS blockers (n\u00a0=\u00a054) in the first year of transplant. There was no significant difference in any donor/recipient demographic between the two groups. Graft function, incidence of delayed graft function, acute rejection, and persistent proteinuria were not statistically different either. Kaplan-Meier estimated death-censored graft survivals were significantly better in group 1 than in group 2: 95 vs. 81.2%, 82.4 vs. 61.2%, 72.6 vs. 58.5%, and 68.5 vs. 47.2% at 1, 3, 5, and 7\u00a0years, respectively (log rank P\u00a0=\u00a00.043). Multivariable analysis found persistent proteinuria was a risk factor for graft loss (OR 2.70, 95% CI 1.33-5.49, P\u00a0=\u00a00.006), while RAS blockers reduced the risk of graft loss (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.18-0.79, P\u00a0=\u00a00.009). Early RAS blockade therapy in the first year of transplant is associated with superior long-term graft survival among adults transplanted with single pediatric donor kidneys.",

The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of two ACE inhibitors, captopril and enalapril, and two AT1 receptor antagonists, losartan and telmisartan, on the protective action of gabapentin in the maximal electroshock seizure threshold test in mice. Additionally, the effects of the combined treatment with gabapentin and antihypertensive drugs on memory retention in the passive avoidance task and motor coordination in the chimney test were assessed. All drugs were injected intraperitoneally. Losartan (50mg/kg) significantly increased the convulsive threshold for gabapentin. The other antihypertensive drugs, captopril (50mg/kg), enalapril (30 mg/kg) and telmisartan (30 mg/kg), did not affect the anticonvulsant activity of gabapentin. The observed interaction between gabapentin and losartan could be pharmacokinetic in nature. Losartan increased plasma and total brain concentrations of gabapentin. In the chimney test, losartan (50mg/kg) administered with gabapentin (50mg/kg) caused motor impairment. In the passive avoidance test, memory retention was not affected by the combined treatment with gabapentin and antihypertensive drugs. It is suggested that the use of captopril, enalapril and telmisartan in epileptic patients receiving gabapentin is presumed neutral upon its anticonvulsant action. The utmost caution is advised when combining losartan and gabapentin in clinical practice due to the appearance of pharmacokinetic interactions between losartan and gabapentin as well as motor impairment evoked by these drugs in mice.",

ACEI therapy compliance was assessed using the proportion of days covered (PDC) method; patients with a PDC of at least 80 % were considered compliant.

Chronic treatment with luseogliflozin (10 mg/kg/day) produced a sustained increase in glucose excretion and normalized blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels to the same level as seen in the rats treated with insulin. It had no effect on blood pressure. In contrast, lisinopril (10 mg/kg/day) reduced mean blood pressure from 140 to 113 mmHg. Combination therapy significantly reduced blood pressure more than that seen in the rats treated with lisinopril. T2DN rats treated with vehicle exhibited progressive proteinuria, a decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), focal glomerulosclerosis, renal fibrosis, and tubular necrosis. Control of hyperglycemia with luseogliflozin prevented the fall in GFR and reduced the degree of glomerular injury, renal fibrosis, and tubular necrosis. In contrast, control of hyperglycemia with insulin had no effect on the progression of renal disease in T2DN rats. Reducing blood pressure with lisinopril prevented the fall in GFR and reduced proteinuria and the degree of glomerular injury and tubular necrosis. Combination therapy reduced the degree of glomerular injury, renal fibrosis, and tubular necrosis to a greater extent than administration of either drug alone. These results suggest that control of hyperglycemia with luseogliflozin slows the progression of diabetic nephropathy more than that seen with insulin, and combination therapy is more renoprotective than administration of either compound alone.",

Rats given fructose-enriched diet (FED) develop the MS including NAFLD. In this study, we characterized changes in splenocyte apoptosis in FED rats given medications to treat various components of the MS. Apoptosis of splenocytes may induce immunosuppression. Splenocyte apoptosis was evaluated by activated caspase-3 immunohistochemistry in the periarterial sheath (PALS), (a T cell area), follicles (B cell area), marginal (B cell area) and in the red pulp zones. FED administration caused an enormous increase in splenocyte apoptosis in all of the spleen zones: PALS (+2966%), follicles (+3025%), marginal (+5228%) and red pulp (+7000%). Administration of captopril to the FED rats was associated with a further increase in the splenocyte apoptosis only in the marginal (150%), PALS (+105%) and red pulp (+67%) zones. Bezafibrate administration to the FED rats was associated with no further increase in apoptosis rates. Amlodipine administration to the FED rats was associated with almost complete amelioration of the splenocyte apoptosis that was induced by the FED diet. These pharmacological manipulations were also associated with changes in the hepatic lipids composition, and oxidative milieu that did not correlate to the changes in splenocyte apoptosis. NAFLD in FED rats is associated with an increase in splenic apoptosis. Agents administered to treat components of the MS in FED rats may lead to divergent changes in the splenic histology and splenocyte apoptosis.",

Male SHR with surgically implanted radio-telemetry implant that provided direct measurements of arterial pressure and electrocardiogram wave were used. Animals were allocated to two groups (n=5 each). The first group was treated with lisinopril (20 mg/kg by gavage) daily for 10 weeks (treated group); whereas the second was gavaged daily with tap water (untreated group). Arterial blood pressure, ECG and other telemetry parameters were recorded at the start and at the end of 10-week treatment. Collected data were analyzed using specialized software and were statistically tested. In addition to the expected lowering of blood pressure, spectral analysis of R-R intervals revealed that lisinopril treatment for 10 weeks significantly caused 2-3 fold increase in heart rate variability (HRV) during both active and inactive periods. However, R-R interval durations demonstrated variable distribution patterns during those periods. The cause of observed distribution pattern of R-R intervals during active and inactive periods may be of significance to better understand HRV changes and warrants further investigations.",

The identification of the ACE homologue ACE2, which forms Ang-(1-7) from Ang II, and the GPCR Mas as an Ang-(1-7) receptor have provided the necessary biochemical and molecular background and tools to study the biological significance of Ang-(1-7). Most available evidence supports a counter-regulatory role for Ang-(1-7) by opposing many actions of Ang II on AT\u2081 receptors, especially vasoconstriction and proliferation. Many studies have now shown that Ang-(1-7) by acting via Mas receptor exerts inhibitory effects on inflammation and on vascular and cellular growth mechanisms. Ang-(1-7) has also been shown to reduce key signalling pathways and molecules thought to be relevant for fibrogenesis. Here, we review recent findings related to the function of the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis and focus on the role of this axis in modifying processes associated with acute and chronic inflammation, including leukocyte influx, fibrogenesis and proliferation of certain cell types. More attention will be given to the involvement of the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis in the context of renal disease because of the known relevance of the RAS for the function of this organ and for the regulation of kidney inflammation and fibrosis.

    "585": "Most clinical studies showed a rapid (within weeks) raising effect of fenofibrate on SCr levels. This was often accompanied by declined estimated glomerular filtration rate. Risk predictors of this adverse effect might include increased age, impaired renal function and high-dose treatment. Also, the concomitant use of medications affecting renal hemodynamics (e.g. angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers) may predispose to fenofibrate-associated increased SCr levels. Interestingly, SCr increases by fenofibrate were transient and reversible even without treatment discontinuation. Furthermore, fenofibrate was associated with a slower progression of renal function impairment and albuminuria in a long-term basis. Also, fenofibrate might be protective against pathological changes in diabetic nephropathy and hypertensive glomerulosclerosis. In this context, it is uncertain whether fenofibrate-associated increase in SCr levels mirrors true renal function deterioration. Several theories have been expressed.

Increased creatinine secretion or reduced creatinine clearance by fenofibrate was also suggested. These hypotheses should be settled by further studies.",

    "587": "Heart failure is a common disease with high levels of morbidity and mortality. A large body of evidence guiding treatment shows prognostic benefit with beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, while diuretics are commonly prescribed for symptomatic benefit. Wide variation in drug response between clinically similar patients is a significant problem. Evidence suggests this may have a genetic component. Variation in candidate genes including the beta-1, beta-2, and alpha-2 adrenergic receptors, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone pathway and genes involved in renal electrolyte handling with diuretics may be important. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) potentially influencing drug response include the Arg 389 Gly variant and the Ser 49 Gly variant in the beta-1 adrenergic receptor, the Arg 16 Gly, Gln 27 Glu, and Thr 164 Ile polymorphisms within the beta-2 adrenergic receptor, an insertion at the 287th base pair in the angiotensin-converting enzyme and the Gly 264 Ala mutation in the sodium chloride co-transporter. However, research addressing the clinical significance of these polymorphisms has yielded conflicting results that have had no influence on clinical practice. Genome-wide association studies may provide an alternative approach to discovering genetic variations influencing drug response, a relatively unchartered area in heart failure management. If future work in this area produces a strong case that variation in drug response has a specific and clinically meaningful genetic component, this could be used to guide drug dosing based on genotype; a step forward in the journey toward personally tailored medicine.",

Pulmonary fibrosis is currently the best described \"late effect\" in survivors of acute radiation pneumonitis. However, robust fibrosis does not develop in some rodent strains for years after a single dose of radiation to the whole thorax. We observed radiation-associated focal alveolar lesions that were rich in giant cells and macrophages containing cholesterol clefts in the lungs of irradiated WAG/RijCmcr rats. These lesions were first observed after pneumonitis, around 21 weeks after receiving a radiation dose of 13 Gy to the thorax but not until 71 weeks in unirradiated rats. The number of cholesterol clefts increased with time after irradiation through 64 weeks of observation, and at 30 weeks after 13 Gy, cholesterol clefts were associated with several indices of deterioration in lung function. The number of cholesterol clefts in irradiated lung sections were reduced by the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril (25-42 mg/m\u00b2/day) from 18.7 \u00b1 4.2/lung section to 6.8 \u00b1 2.4 (P = 0.029), 5.2 \u00b1 1.9 (P = 0.0051) and 6.7 \u00b1 1.9 (P = 0.029) when the drug was started at 1 week, 5 or 15 weeks after irradiation, respectively, and continued. Similar lesions have been previously observed in the lungs of one strain of irradiated mice and in patients following radiotherapy. We propose that alveolar lesions with cholesterol clefts may be used as a histological marker of the severity of radiation lung injury and to study its mitigation in WAG/RijCmcr rats.",

Contemporary treatments, by contrast, have been purposely developed to inhibit bradykinin. Most experience pertains to angioedema resulting from C1-inhibitor deficiency, and the controlled studies have focused on the hereditary form of this disease type (HAE). The pathomechanisms of HAE with normal C1-inhibitor activity, as well as of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-releated, and of non-histaminergic idiopathic sporadic angioedemas are largely unknown.

    "611": "PDE4 is one of eleven known cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase families and plays a pivotal role in mediating hydrolytic degradation of the important cyclic nucleotide second messenger, cyclic 3'5' adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). PDE4 inhibitors are known to have anti-inflammatory properties, but their use in the clinic has been hampered by mechanism-associated side effects that limit maximally tolerated doses. In an attempt to initiate the development of better-tolerated PDE4 inhibitors we have surveyed existing approved drugs for PDE4-inhibitory activity. With this objective, we utilised a high-throughput computational approach that identified moexipril, a well tolerated and safe angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, as a PDE4 inhibitor. Experimentally we showed that moexipril and two structurally related analogues acted in the micro molar range to inhibit PDE4 activity. Employing a FRET-based biosensor constructed from the nucleotide binding domain of the type 1 exchange protein activated by cAMP, EPAC1, we demonstrated that moexipril markedly potentiated the ability of forskolin to increase intracellular cAMP levels. Finally, we demonstrated that the PDE4 inhibitory effect of moexipril is functionally able to induce phosphorylation of the small heat shock protein, Hsp20, by cAMP dependent protein kinase A. Our data suggest that moexipril is a bona fide PDE4 inhibitor that may provide the starting point for development of novel PDE4 inhibitors with an improved therapeutic window.",

Recombinant t-PA caused a dose-dependent reduction in thrombus area under low and high shear conditions (P<0.001 for all). Intra-arterial bradykinin increased plasma t-PA concentrations in the chamber effluent (P<0.01 for all versus saline) that was quadrupled in the presence of enalapril (P<0.0001 versus placebo). These increases were accompanied by an increase in plasma D-dimer concentration (P<0.005 for all versus saline) and, in the presence of enalapril, a reduction in thrombus area in the low shear (16\u00b15; P=0.03) and a trend toward a reduction in the high shear chamber (13\u00b17%; P=0.07).",

As a result, delapril has a more potent inhibition capacity of vascular wall angiotensin-converting enzyme activity and a lower incidence of cough than enalapril or captopril. With regard to efficacy, delapril has a long-lasting antihypertensive effect with a trough/peak ratio that is in the upper range of different ACEIs and a positively high smoothness index. Thus, delapril effectively and smoothly reduces blood pressure over 24\u00a0h.

Diabetes was experimentally induced by a combination of a high-fat diet with a single low dose of streptozotocin (35 mg/kg, intraperitoneal injection). D-SHR were orally administered with olmesartan (5 mg/kg/day), enalapril (10 mg/kg/day) or vehicle for 28 days, and compared with vehicle-treated non-diabetic SHR or normotensive non-diabetic Wistar-Kyoto rats. The cerebral and skeletal muscle functional capillary density of pentobarbital-anesthetized rats was assessed using intravital fluorescence videomicroscopy. Chronic treatment with olmesartan or enalapril significantly lowered blood pressure and reversed brain functional capillary rarefaction. Brain oxidative stress was reduced to non-diabetic control levels in animals treated with olmesartan or enalapril. Histochemical analysis of the structural capillary density showed that both olmesartan and enalapril increased the capillary-to-fiber ratio in skeletal muscle and the capillary-to-fiber volume density in the left ventricle. Olmesartan and enalapril also prevented collagen deposition and the increase in cardiomyocyte diameter in the left ventricle. Our results suggest that the association between hypertension and diabetes results in microvascular alterations in the brain, skeletal muscle and myocardium that can be prevented by chronic blockade of the renin-angiotensin system.",

Wettability and surface free energy were determined using sessile drop contact angle technique. TMS samples exhibited significant variations in their wetting behavior. The role of crystal shape, particle size distribution, surface energetics and surface chemistry in controlling TMS powder wettability was collectively explored by contact angle experiments. Evaluation of work of adhesion (Wa), immersion (Wi) and spreading (Ws) indicated that samples had differential wetting behavior. The surface chemistry was elucidated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The surface polarity index was determined by XPS and expressed as (oxygen+nitrogen)-to-(carbon) atomic concentration ratio. It was found to be different for all four TMS samples. Crystal morphology of TMS polymorph A was predicted using Bravais-Friedel Donnay-Harker (BFDH) method. Molecular lipophilic surface potential (MLSP) data for TMS showed the varied surface lipophilic environment throughout the molecule.

We tested the hypothesis that targeting left-ventricular (LV) reactive oxygen species (ROS) upregulation subsequent to hyperglycemia attenuates type 1 diabetes-induced LV remodeling and dysfunction, accompanied by attenuated proinflammatory markers and cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Male 6-week-old mice received either streptozotocin (55mg/kg/day for 5 days), to induce type 1 diabetes, or citrate buffer vehicle. After 4 weeks of hyperglycemia, the mice were allocated to coenzyme Q10 supplementation (10mg/kg/day), treatment with the angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) ramipril (3mg/kg/day), treatment with olive oil vehicle, or no treatment for 8 weeks. Type 1 diabetes upregulated LV NADPH oxidase (Nox2, p22(phox), p47(phox) and superoxide production), LV uncoupling protein UCP3 expression, and both LV and systemic oxidative stress (LV 3-nitrotyrosine and plasma lipid peroxidation). All of these were significantly attenuated by coenzyme Q10. Coenzyme Q10 substantially limited type 1 diabetes-induced impairments in LV diastolic function (E:A ratio and deceleration time by echocardiography, LV end-diastolic pressure, and LV -dP/dt by micromanometry), LV remodeling (cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, cardiac fibrosis, apoptosis), and LV expression of proinflammatory mediators (tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, with a similar trend for interleukin IL-1\u03b2). Coenzyme Q10's actions were independent of glycemic control, body mass, and blood pressure. Coenzyme Q10 compared favorably to improvements observed with ramipril. In summary, these data suggest that coenzyme Q10 effectively targets LV ROS upregulation to limit type 1 diabetic cardiomyopathy. Coenzyme Q10 supplementation may thus represent an effective alternative to ACE-Is for the treatment of cardiac complications in type 1 diabetic patients.",

Although poor compliance to therapy is associated with less BP control, little is known regarding other barriers to attaining on-treatment target BP. This study examined factors associated with achieving on-treatment target BP in 6010 hypertensive participants aged 65-84 years from the Second Australian National Blood Pressure study. Participants were followed for a median of 4.1 years, with BP monitored every 6 months. 'Target BP' was defined as a reduction of systolic/diastolic BP of at least 20/10\u2009mm\u2009Hg and BP <160/90\u2009mm\u2009Hg from randomization in two consecutive follow-up visits. Cox regression was used to identify factors associated with achieving target BP from a number of baseline and in-study factors. Mean BP at randomization was 168/91\u2009mm\u2009Hg and patients had a median of 9 (range: 2-20) study visits. Target BP was achieved in 50% of patients. Demographic factors associated with achieving target BP were male gender, living in a regional area; and clinical factors included history of antihypertensive therapy, increased plasma creatinine, lower pretreatment pulse pressure and in-study use of multiple BP-lowering drugs. Those aged >80 years and seeking care from multiple doctors (hazard ratio 0.40, 95% confidence interval 0.36-0.45, P<0.001) were less likely to achieve target BP. These findings identify clinical markers that can be targeted for intervention, but also demographic factors related to service delivery, which may provide further opportunity for achieving better BP control in hypertensive elderly.",

Recently, in diabetes mellitus, early detection of proteinuria and treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors has been shown to slow progression of kidney disease and to improve prognosis. In this study, we investigated the spontaneous course of proteinuria in SSc and the effects of ACE inhibitor therapy. Proteinuria was determined in SSc patients with urine protein electrophoresis. SSc patients with proteinuria (n = 31) were followed over a median of 12 months. Of all 31 patients with pathologic urine protein electrophoresis investigated in this study, 9 patients (29 %) had additional microalbuminuria and 4 patients (12.9 %) showed increased total urinary protein. ACE inhibitor treatment was subsequently given to 23 patients. A total of 8 patients remained untreated for various reasons. Proteinuria resolved in 74 % of patients treated with ACE inhibitors, whereas in the untreated group, remission was observed only in 25 % (p = 0.014). Improvement of proteinuria was predominantly achieved in patients with recently diagnosed proteinuria and short disease duration. In patients with SSc and proteinuria, initiation of ACE inhibitor therapy resulted in a significant decrease in proteinuria.",

The combination of graphene and CuHCF considerably improved the current response of the GCE towards the oxidation of captopril. Studies showed that the best response of the modified electrode could be achieved within neutral pHs. At a fixed potential under hydrodynamic conditions (stirred solutions), the oxidation current is proportional to the captopril concentration and the calibration plots were linear over the concentration ranges of 0.2 to 5.8 \u03bcM and 5.8 to 480 \u03bcM.

Women comprised 32% of 1,449 subjects and were 21% of subjects with BAV, 34% with FTAAD, 22% with TAAD <50 years, and 47% with MFS. Thoracic aortic dissections occurred with equal gender frequency yet women with BAV had more extensive dissections. Aortic size was smaller in women but was similar after controlling for BSA. Age at operation for aortic valve dysfunction, aneurysm or dissection did not differ by gender. Multivariate analysis (adjusting for age, BSA, hypertension, study site, diabetes, and subgroup diagnoses) showed that women had fewer total aortic surgeries (OR = 0.65, P < 0.01) and were less likely to receive angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi; OR = 0.68, P < 0.05). As in BAV, other genetically triggered aortic diseases such as FTAAD and TAAD <50 are more common in males. In women, decreased prevalence of aortic operations and less treatment with ACEi may be due to their smaller absolute aortic diameters. Longitudinal studies are needed to determine if women are at higher risk for adverse events.",

It was found that RPH contained high levels of Gly, Glu, Pro, Asp and Ala, having potential ACE inhibitory activity in vitro with an IC(50) of 1.28 mg/ml. It was also found that systolic blood pressure was reduced markedly in spontaneously hypertensive rats after single and chronic oral administration of RPH, indicating that RPH had an antihypertensive effect. In addition, oral administration of RPH decreased total serum cholesterol and triglyceride, and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in rats fed with high-fat diet.

This process consisted of the combination of adsorption and microfiltration within a stirred cell unit for the selective immobilisation of \u03b2-lactoglobulin and casein-derived peptides (CDP) from whey. The adsorbed proteins were hydrolysed in situ, which resulted in the separation of peptide products from the substrate and fractionation of peptides. Two different hydrolysates were produced: (i) from CDP (IC(50)=287 \u03bcg/mL) and (ii) from \u03b2-lactoglobulin (IC(50)=128 \u03bcg/mL). The well-known antihypertensive peptide IPP and several novel peptides that have structural similarities with reported ACE inhibitory peptides were identified and characterised in both hydrolysates.

BP (blood pressure) was similarly reduced in both aliskiren-treated and ramipril-treated rats compared with control dTGR (167\u00b11 and 169\u00b12 mmHg compared with 197\u00b14 mmHg respectively; P<0.05). The M/L (media-to-lumen) ratio assessed on pressurized preparations was equally reduced in aliskiren-treated and ramipril-treated rats compared with controls (6.3\u00b10.5 and 6.4\u00b10.2% compared with 9.8\u00b10.4% respectively; P<0.05). Endothelium-dependent and -independent relaxations were similar among the groups. L-NAME (N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester) significantly reduced acetylcholine-induced dilation in drug-treated dTGR. This effect was significantly more prominent in aliskiren-treated rats. eNOS (endothelial NO synthase) expression showed a 2-fold increase only in aliskiren-treated dTGR as compared with controls (P<0.01) and ramipril-treated dTGR (P<0.05). Plasma nitrite, as an index of NO production, was significantly increased in dTGR treated with either aliskiren or ramipril compared with controls. Only aliskiren induced a 2-fold increase in plasma nitrite, which was significantly greater than that induced by ramipril (P<0.05). gp91(phox) expression and ROS (reactive oxygen species) production in aorta were significantly and similarly reduced by both drugs. In conclusion, equieffective hypotensive doses of aliskiren or ramipril reduced the M/L ratio of mesenteric arteries and improved oxidative stress in dTGR. However, only aliskiren increased further NO production in the vasculature. Hence, in dTGR, direct renin inhibition induces favourable effects similar to that induced by ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibition in improving vascular remodelling through different mechanisms.", 
    "672": "Cancer cachexia describes the progressive skeletal muscle wasting and weakness associated with many cancers. Cachexia reduces mobility and quality of life and accounts for 20-30% of all cancer-related deaths. Activation of the renin-angiotensin system causes skeletal muscle wasting and weakness. We tested the hypothesis that treatment with the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, perindopril, would enhance whole body and skeletal muscle function in cachectic mice bearing Colon-26 (C-26) tumors. CD2F1 mice received a subcutaneous injection of phosphate buffered saline or C-26 tumor cells inducing either a mild or severe cachexia. The following day, one cohort of C-26 mice began receiving perindopril in their drinking water (4 mg kg(-1) day(-1) ) for 21 days. In mild and severe cachexia, perindopril increased measures of whole body function (grip strength and rotarod) and reduced fatigue in isolated contracting diaphragm muscle strips (p\u2009<\u20090.05). In severely cachectic mice, perindopril reduced tumor growth, improved locomotor activity and reduced fatigue of tibialis anterior muscles in situ (p\u2009<\u20090.05), which was associated with increased oxidative enzyme capacity (succinate deyhydrogenase, p\u2009<\u20090.05). Perindopril attenuated the increase in MuRF-1 and IL-6 mRNA expression and enhanced Akt phosphorylation in severely cachectic mice but neither body nor muscle mass was increased. These findings support the therapeutic potential of ACE inhibition for enhancing whole body function and reducing fatigue of respiratory muscles in early and late stage cancer cachexia and should be confirmed in future clinical trials. Since ACE inhibition alone did not enhance body or muscle mass, co-treatment with an anabolic agent may be required to address these aspects of cancer cachexia.",

    "677": "Nephrotic-range proteinuria has been known for years to be associated with poor renal outcome. Newer evidence indicates that early (1-3 months after transplantation) low-grade proteinuria and microalbuminuria (1) provide information on the graft in terms of donor characteristics and ischemia/reperfusion injury, (2) may occur before the development of donor-specific antibodies, (3) predict the development of diabetes and cardiovascular events, and (4) are associated with reduced long-term graft and patient survivals. Low-grade proteinuria and microalbuminuria are also predictive of diabetes, cardiovascular morbidity, and death in nontransplanted populations, which may help us to understand the pathophysiology of low-grade proteinuria or microalbuminuria in renal transplantation. The impact of immunosuppressive medications, including mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors, on graft survival is still discussed, and the effect on proteinuria is crucial to the debate. The fact that chronic allograft rejection may exist as early as 3 months after renal transplantation indicates that optimal management of low-grade proteinuria or microalbuminuria should occur very early after transplantation to improve long-term renal function and the overall outcome of renal transplant recipients. The presence of low-grade proteinuria or microalbuminuria early after transplantation must be taken into account to choose adequate immunosuppressive and antihypertensive medications. Limited information exists regarding the benefit of therapeutic interventions to reduce low-grade proteinuria or microalbuminuria. Whether renin angiotensin blockade results in optimal nephroprotection in patients with low-grade proteinuria or microalbuminuria is not proven, especially in the absence of chronic allograft nephropathy. Observational studies and randomized clinical trials yield conflicting results. Finally, randomized clinical trials are urgently needed.",

Office blood pressure (BP) was measured at 0, 2, 6 and 12 weeks, 24-hour ambulatory BP at 0 and 12 weeks. 284 patients treated with olmesartan medoxomil 40 mg/day at the end of the double-blind period entered a 36-week, open-label follow-up. Renal function (Cockroft-Gault equation) was evaluated as normal or increased estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) [\u226590 mL/min/1.73 m(2)], mild eGFR reduction (60-90 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) and moderate or severe eGFR reduction (<60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)).",

In the group with moderately or severely reduced eGFR the two treatments were comparable (SBP: 1.9 mmHg [4.6, 0.9], p = 0.185; DBP: 0.8 mmHg [2.3, +0.7]; p = 0.296). At 12 weeks, the rate of normalized patients was 46.1 % with olmesartan medoxomil versus 23.9% with ramipril (p = 0.002) in the normal, and 49.9% versus 42.7% (p = 0.037) in the mild eGFR reduction group.

    "695": "Both propofol use and advanced age are predictors of intraoperative hypotension. We previously demonstrated that propofol enhances vasodilation in mesenteric arteries from aged rats, partly due to increased nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability. Patients chronically treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may exhibit refractory hypotension under general anesthesia. We hypothesized that propofol enhances NO-mediated vasodilation in arteries from aged rats chronically treated with ACE inhibitors.",

Before euthanasia, arterial blood pressures were obtained through carotid artery cannulation. Concentration-response curves to propofol (0.1-100 \u00b5M) or methacholine (MCh) (0.01-3 \u00b5M) were then assessed on isolated resistance mesenteric arteries (100-200 \u03bcm diameter) from both treatment (captopril) and control rats. MCh relaxation was also assessed after propofol pretreatment (1 and 10 \u00b5M). N(G)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME) (100 \u00b5M) and meclofenamate (10 \u00b5M) were used to inhibit NO and prostaglandin synthesis, respectively. Concentration-response data were summarized as 50% of the maximum relaxation response or area under the curve.",

When comparing relaxation in arteries from captopril-treated versus untreated rats, concentration-response curves revealed that captopril-treated rats display greater direct propofol relaxation (P = 0.018). MCh relaxation in the absence of propofol, however, was not different between captopril-treated and untreated rats (P = 0.80). Propofol pretreatment increased MCh relaxation in arteries from captopril-treated compared with untreated rats (P = 0.029 for 1 \u00b5M and P = 0.020 for 10 \u00b5M). Meclofenamate did not have an effect in this response (P = 0.22). l-NAME-dependent inhibition of MCh relaxation, however, was greater in arteries from control compared with captopril-treated rats (P = 0.0077). However, propofol increased the proportion of NO-dependent vasodilation to MCh similarly in both groups. This suggests that other vasodilatory pathways are involved in the differential response to MCh in the presence of propofol in captopril-treated rats.", 
    "698": "Our results show that mesenteric arterial relaxation in response to propofol, both by direct stimulation and through modulation of endothelium-dependent mechanisms, is, in part, NO-dependent. In captopril-treated rats, propofol further increased arterial relaxation through a non-NO-dependent vasodilating pathway (e.g., endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor), which may account for enhanced vasodilation during propofol exposure in patients treated with ACE inhibitors.",

Our aim was to establish whether similar effects occur in nondiabetic hypertensive patients using this combination. A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover design was used. After a 6-week run-in, when regular antihypertensive medications were withdrawn and placebo substituted, patients received captopril 50 mg twice daily with either bendroflumethiazide 1.25 mg (CB) or placebo (CP) for 12 weeks with a 6-week wash-out between treatments. Insulin action was assessed by hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp after the 6-week run-in and at the end of each treatment period. There were no differences between treatments in fasting glucose or insulin concentrations. Glucose infusion rates required to maintain euglycemia were the same with each treatment (CP 22.1\u00b12.2 vs CB 22.2\u00b12.2 \u03bcmol/kg per minute).

We have previously established that inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) reduces food intake, body weight and glucose homeostasis in diet-induced obesity. The current study assessed the effect of ACE inhibitor treatment in MC4R-deficient female rats on body weight, adiposity and glucose tolerance. Rats homozygous (HOM) for a loss of function Mc4r mutation had an obese phenotype relative to their wildtype (WT) littermates. Inhibition of ACE for 8weeks produced reductions in body weight gain in both HOM and WT rats; however, food intake was only reduced in HOM rats. Weight loss following ACE inhibitor treatment was specific to fat mass while lean mass was unaffected. HOM rats were severely glucose intolerant and insensitive to exogenous insulin injection, and treatment with an ACE inhibitor improved both glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in HOM rats although not fully to that of the level of WT rats. The current study indicates that HOM rats are sensitive to the anorectic effects of ACE inhibition, unlike their WT littermates. This resulted in a more rapid reduction in body weight gain and a more substantial loss of adipose mass in HOM animals, relative to WT animals, treated with an ACE inhibitor. Overall, these data demonstrate that MC4R signaling is not required for weight loss following treatment with an ACE inhibitor.",

To examine the role of the AT2 receptor in this model, we studied hearts from SHR treated with valsartan or enalapril either alone or combined with the AT2 antagonist PD123319 for 1 or 2 weeks. Apoptosis was evaluated by quantification of DNA fragmentation or by TUNEL labeling. At 1 week, valsartan significantly increased ventricular DNA fragmentation, increased apoptosis in epicardial mesothelial cells, and decreased DNA synthesis. At 2 weeks, ventricular DNA content and cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area were significantly reduced. These valsartan-induced changes were attenuated by PD123319 co-administration. However, valsartan-induced increases in apoptosis of left ventricular interstitial non-cardiomyocytes was unaffected by the AT2 blocker. Enalapril-induced changes were similar to those observed with valsartan but were not affected by co-treatment with PD123319. These results demonstrate that AT1 and AT2 receptors act in a coordinated yet cell-specific manner to regulate cell growth and apoptosis in the left ventricle of SHR during AT1 receptor blockade but not ACE inhibition.",

    "751": "By nature of their nucleophilicity, all thiol-based drugs are oxidatively metabolized in the physiological environment. The key to understanding the physiological role of a hypertension drug, (2S)-1-[(2S)-2-methyl-3-sulfanylpropanoyl]pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid, medically known as captopril is through studying its oxidation pathway: its reactive intermediates and oxidation products. The oxidation of captopril by aqueous bromine and acidified bromate has been studied by spectrophotometric and electrospray ionization techniques. The stoichiometry for the reaction of acidic bromate with captopril is 1:1, BrO3(-) + (C4H6N)(COOH)(COCHCH3CH2)-SH \u2192 (C4H6N)(COOH)(COCHCH3CH2)-SO3H + Br(-), with reaction occurring only at the thiol center. For the direct reaction of bromine with captopril, the ratio is 3:1; 3Br2 + (C4H6N)(COOH)(COCHCH3CH2)-SH + 3H2O \u2192 (C4H6N)(COOH)(COCHCH3CH2)-SO3H + 6HBr. In excess acidic bromate conditions the reaction displays an initial induction period followed by a sharp rise in absorbance at 390 nm due to rapid formation of bromine. The direct reaction of aqueous bromine with captopril was much faster than oxidation of the thiol by acidified bromate, with a bimolecular rate constant of (1.046 (\u00b10.08) \u00d7 10(5) M(-1) s(-1). The detection of thiyl radicals confirms the involvement of radicals as intermediates in the oxidation of Captopril by acidified BrO3(-). The involvement of thiyl radicals in oxidation of captopril competes with a nonradical pathway involving 2-electron oxidations of the sulfur center. The oxidation product of captopril under these strong oxidizing conditions is a sulfonic acid as confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), iodometric titrations, and proton nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)H NMR) results. There was no evidence from ESI-MS for the formation of the sulfenic and sulfinic acids in the oxidation pathway as the thiol group is rapidly oxidized to the sulfonic acid. A computer simulation analysis of this mechanism gave a reasonably good fit to the experimental data.", 
    "752": "Although the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is already an old acquaintance, there are often exciting discoveries that improve our knowledge of it and open new therapeutic possibilities. Moreover, well-established drugs, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), or beta-blockers, show that their mechanism of action may be the result of parallel pathways other than the ones initially established. A detailed analysis of the RAS can be carried out in part through the study of the enzymes, named angiotensinases, involved in its cascade, whose activity is a reflection of the functionality of their peptide substrates. The study of these enzymes offers the possibility of controlling the effects of angiotensins through various pharmacological manipulations. For example, angiotensinase inhibitors or activators are being used or have been proposed as antihypertensive agents. They have also been suggested as analgesic and antidepressant drugs or targets for drug development against different pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy or ischemia. On the other hand, the analysis of brain asymmetry has revealed surprising results about the laterality of central and peripheral components of the RAS. Such studies indicate that the neurovisceral integration, already proposed by Claude Bernard (1867) should also be analyzed from a bilateral perspective. In this review, the RAS and the role of various angiotensinases implicated in the cascade are revisited. Therapeutic strategies involving some components of the RAS with an unusual vision resulting from a bilateral perspective added to their study are discussed.",

The National Inpatient Samples 2000-2009 were queried for AEHs to calculate hospitalization rates and to examine for associations with specified ADEs, certain comorbidities, and demographic features. AEHs requiring intubation or tracheostomy were also examined for associations. There was a significant increase in the AEH rates (3.4 per 10(5) to 5.4 per 10(5)) over the study period (p < 0.0001) and the hospitalization rates for African Americans (AAs) were consistently higher. Throughout the study the proportions of AEH coding any ADEs, or an ADE due to a cardiovascular (CV) or antihypertensive (aHTN) drug increased over time. By 2009, 61.7% AEHs coded an ADE. Of these, 58.7% were caused by CV or aHTN drugs. In AEHs, having an ADE from a CV or aHTN medication had the strongest adjusted associations with hypertension and renal disease as well as with alcohol-related disorders. In AEHs, intubation/tracheostomy had the strongest ADE associations related to CV or aHTN medication (adjusted odds ratio, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.3, 1.6). AEHs continue to increase, but this can only be partially attributed to ACE inhibitor usage. Intubation/tracheostomy appears to be greater in AEHs with ADE due to CV/aHTN drugs.

It is common knowledge that only 30% of hypertensive patients can be controlled using monotherapy; all the rest require a combination of two or more antihypertensive drugs, and this can be a barrier to good adherence and log-term persistence in patients who also often need to use other drugs, such as antidiabetic agents, statins or antiplatelet agents. The fixed combinations of three antihypertensive agents currently available can facilitate long-term control of these patients in clinical practice.

    "771": "The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays a key role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disorders including hypertension and is one of the most important targets for drugs. A whole body physiologically based pharmacokinetic (wb PBPK) model integrating this hormone circulation system and its inhibition can be used to explore the influence of drugs that interfere with this system, and thus to improve the understanding of interactions between drugs and the target system. In this study, we describe the development of a mechanistic RAAS model and exemplify drug action by a simulation of enalapril administration. Enalapril and its metabolite enalaprilat are potent inhibitors of the angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE). To this end, a coupled dynamic parent-metabolite PBPK model was developed and linked with the RAAS model that consists of seven coupled PBPK models for aldosterone, ACE, angiotensin 1, angiotensin 2, angiotensin 2 receptor type 1, renin, and prorenin. The results indicate that the model represents the interactions in the RAAS in response to the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of enalapril and enalaprilat in an accurate manner. The full set of RAAS-hormone profiles and interactions are consistently described at pre- and post-administration steady state as well as during their dynamic transition and show a good agreement with literature data. The model allows a simultaneous representation of the parent-metabolite conversion to the active form as well as the effect of the drug on the hormone levels, offering a detailed mechanistic insight into the hormone cascade and its inhibition. This model constitutes a first major step to establish a PBPK-PD-model including the PK and the mode of action (MoA) of a drug acting on a dynamic RAAS that can be further used to link to clinical endpoints such as blood pressure.",

Expression of colonic and ileal NHE-3 isoform, its regulatory factor-1 (NHERF-1) and cyclic GMP kinase II (cGKII) were examined using western blot analysis. Since NHE-3 activity is regulated by its abundance on the plasma membrane, its levels were also examined in lipid rafts-enriched membrane fractions. The lipid rafts fractions were characterized by examining the concentration of flotillin-1 and caveolin-1, total protein, and cholesterol. Twelve-weeks-old SHR used in this study developed significant hypertension, proteinuria, and renal and cardiac hypertrophy. These changes were significantly reversed by captopril treatment. There was a significant decrease in the levels of NHE-3 and NHERF-1 proteins, and sodium pump activity, but an increase in the cGKII levels in both tissues from SHR. Reduction in NHERF-1 levels was reversed by captopril but not of the other proteins. Cholesterol profile was significantly different in SHR colon as compared to normo-tensive Wistar Kyoto rats. These findings suggest that suppression of NHE-3 in intestine is a counteracting mechanism of hypertension and is regulated by NHERF-1 through cGKII activation in SHR. NHE-3 suppression together with decrease in the sodium pump activity would accumulate intracellular Na(+) and may contribute to the reported hypertension-induced tissue damage in the GI-tract.",

    "794": "Nitric oxide (NO) produced by the endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) is an antihypertensive, antithrombotic and anti-atherosclerotic molecule. Hypercholesterolemia leads to a reduction in vascular NO bioavailability. This is attributed to a dysfunction of the eNOS enzyme and a reduced eNOS activity. NADPH oxidase-mediated oxidative stress leads to oxidation of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), the essential cofactor of eNOS. In BH4 deficiency, oxygen reduction uncouples from NO synthesis, thereby converting eNOS to a superoxide-producing enzyme. As a consequence of eNOS uncoupling, NO production is reduced and the pre-existing oxidative stress is enhanced, which contribute significantly to atherogenesis. Therefore, pharmacological approaches that prevent eNOS uncoupling and enhance eNOS activity are of therapeutic interest. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, AT1 receptor blockers, statins, nebivolol and resveratrol have been shown to reverse eNOS uncoupling and to stimulate eNOS activity concurrently. Molecular mechanisms of the aforementioned drugs/compounds on eNOS functionality is summarized and discussed in this review.",

Here, we stabilized hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs) in mice by conditionally deleting their negative regulator, Vhl, using the Cre/loxP system with renin-1d promoter-driven Cre expression. Vhl (\u2212/\u2212(REN)) mice were viable and had normal BP. Deletion of Vhl resulted in constitutive accumulation of HIF-2\u03b1 in afferent arterioles and glomerular cells and HIF-1\u03b1 in collecting duct cells of the adult kidney. The preglomerular vascular tree developed normally, but far fewer renin-expressing cells were present, with more than 70% of glomeruli not containing renin cells at the typical juxtaglomerular position. Moreover, these mice had an attenuated expansion of renin-producing cells in response to a low-salt diet combined with an ACE inhibitor. However, renin-producing cells of Vhl (\u2212/\u2212(REN)) mice expressed the erythropoietin gene, and they were markedly polycythemic. Taken together, these results suggest that hypoxia-inducible genes, regulated by VHL, are essential for normal development and physiologic adaptation of renin-producing cells.

This study tests the hypothesis that in adult female rats, RAS and estrogen contribute to insulin resistance resulting from perinatal taurine imbalance. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were fed normal rat chow with 3% \u03b2-alanine (taurine depletion, TD), 3% taurine (taurine supplementation, TS), or water alone (control, C) from conception to weaning. Their female offspring were fed normal rat chow with 5% glucose in water (TDG, TSG, CG) or water alone (TDW, TSW, CW) throughout the experiment. At 7-8 weeks of age, animals were studied with or without captopril inhibition of the RAS and with or without estrogen receptor inhibition by tamoxifen. Compared to CW and CG groups, perinatal taurine depletion but not supplementation slightly increased plasma insulin levels. High sugar intake slightly increased plasma insulin only in TSG. Captopril treatment significantly increased plasma insulin in all groups except CG (the greatest increase was in TDG). Changes in insulin resistance and insulin secretion paralleled the changes in plasma insulin levels. In contrast, tamoxifen treatment increased insulin resistance and decreased insulin secretion only in TDG and this group displayed hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance. These data indicate that perinatal taurine imbalance alters the interplay of RAS and estrogen on glucose-insulin regulation in adult female rats.", 
    "804": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) catalyzes conversion of ANG II to ANG-(1-7). The present study uses newly established proteomic approaches and genetic mouse models to examine the contribution of alternative renal peptidases to ACE2-independent formation of ANG-(1-7). In situ and in vitro mass spectrometric characterization showed that substrate concentration and pH control renal ANG II processing. At pH \u22656, ANG-(1-7) formation was significantly reduced in ACE2 knockout (KO) mice. However, at pH <6, formation of ANG-(1-7) in ACE2 KO mice was similar to that in wild-type (WT) mice, suggesting alternative peptidases for renal ANG II processing. Furthermore, the dual prolyl carboxypeptidase (PCP)-prolyl endopeptidase (PEP) inhibitor Z-prolyl-prolinal reduced ANG-(1-7) formation in ACE2 KO mice, while the ACE2 inhibitor MLN-4760 had no effect. Unlike the ACE2 KO mice, ANG-(1-7) formation from ANG II in PEP KO mice was not different from that in WT mice at any tested pH. However, at pH 5, this reaction was significantly reduced in kidneys and urine of PCP-depleted mice. In conclusion, results suggest that ACE2 metabolizes ANG II in the kidney at neutral and basic pH, while PCP catalyzes the same reaction at acidic pH. This is the first report demonstrating that renal ANG-(1-7) formation from ANG II is independent of ACE2. Elucidation of ACE2-independent ANG-(1-7) production pathways may have clinically important implications in patients with metabolic and renal disease.",

    "812": "Carboxylesterases are a multigene family of mammalian enzymes widely distributed throughout the body that catalyze the hydrolysis of esters, amides, thioesters, and carbamates. In humans, two carboxylesterases, hCE1 and hCE2, are important mediators of drug metabolism. Both are expressed in the liver, but hCE1 greatly exceeds hCE2. In the intestine, only hCE2 is present and highly expressed. The most common drug substrates of these enzymes are ester prodrugs specifically designed to enhance oral bioavailability by hydrolysis to the active carboxylic acid after absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Carboxylesterases also play an important role in the hydrolysis of some drugs to inactive metabolites. It has been widely believed that drugs undergoing hydrolysis by hCE1 and hCE2 are not subject to clinically significant alterations in their disposition, but evidence exists that genetic polymorphisms, drug-drug interactions, drug-disease interactions and other factors are important determinants of the variability in the therapeutic response to carboxylesterase-substrate drugs. The implications for drug therapy are far-reaching, as substrate drugs include numerous examples from widely prescribed therapeutic classes. Representative drugs include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, antiplatelet drugs, statins, antivirals, and central nervous system agents. As research interest increases in the carboxylesterases, evidence is accumulating of their important role in drug metabolism and, therefore, the outcomes of pharmacotherapy.", 
    "813": "Enzymes are an important class of drug targets. In the early stage of the drug discovery, the major task is to find out the inhibitors of a given enzyme target in a compound library. Herein we describe a method for screening the enzyme inhibitors in the complex mixtures (such as the natural extracts) by capillary electrophoresis with an on-column immobilized enzyme microreactor. The enzyme molecules are immobilized on the capillary wall via ionic binding with the positively charged coating, which was created by simply flushing the column with a solution of polyelectrolyte hexadimethrine bromide. The activities of the immobilized enzymes are assayed by performing the electrophoretic separation and thereafter determining the product of the enzyme-mediated reaction. Enzyme inhibition can be read out directly from the reduced peak area of product in comparison with that in the reference electropherogram obtained in the absence of any inhibitor.", 
    "814": "Targeting the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) constitutes a major advance in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Evidence indicates that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin AT1 receptor blockers act on both the RAS and the kallikrein-kinin system (KKS). In addition to the interaction between the RAS and KKS at the level of angiotensin-converting enzyme catalyzing both angiotensin II generation and bradykinin degradation, the RAS and KKS also interact at other levels: 1) prolylcarboxypeptidase, an angiotensin II inactivating enzyme and a prekallikrein activator; 2) kallikrein, a kinin-generating and prorenin-activating enzyme; 3) angiotensin-(1-7) exerts kininlike effects and potentiates the effects of bradykinin; and 4) the angiotensin AT1 receptor forms heterodimers with the bradykinin B2 receptor. Moreover, angiotensin II enhances B1 and B2 receptor expression via transcriptional mechanisms. These cross-talks explain why both the RAS and KKS are up-regulated in some circumstances, whereas in other circumstances both systems change in the opposite manner, expressed as an activated RAS and a depressed KKS. As the cross-talks between the RAS and the KKS play an important role in response to different stimuli, taking these cross-talks between the two systems into account may help in the development of drugs targeting the two systems.",

TRPC6 gain-of-function mutations cause autosomal dominant focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. In acquired proteinuric renal disease, glomerular TRPC6 expression is increased. We previously demonstrated that acquired increased TRPC6 expression is ameliorated by antiproteinuric angiotensin receptor blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Vitamin D also has an antiproteinuric effect. We hypothesized that vitamin D reduces proteinuria by affecting TRPC6 expression in podocytes. Adriamycin-induced nephropathy increased TRPC6 mRNA and protein expression and induced proteinuria in rats. Treatment with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-D3) normalized TRPC6 expression and reduced proteinuria. In\u00a0vitro, podocyte injury induced by adriamycin exposure in cultured podocytes increased TRPC6 expression. Treatment of injured podocytes with 1,25-D3 dose dependently reduced adriamycin-induced TRPC6 expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that the vitamin D receptor directly binds to the TRPC6 promoter. Moreover, 1,25-D3 reduced TRPC6 promoter activity in a luciferase reporter assay. In 1,25-D3-deficient 25-hydroxy-1\u03b1-hydroxylase knockout mice, TRPC6 expression was increased, accompanied by podocyte foot process effacement and proteinuria. 1,25-D3 supplementation normalized TRPC6 expression, podocyte morphology, and proteinuria in these mice. These results demonstrate that vitamin D down-regulates the enhanced TRPC6 expression in in\u00a0vivo and in\u00a0vitro podocyte injury, possibly through a direct effect on TRPC6 promoter activity. This TRPC6 down-regulation could contribute to the antiproteinuric effect of vitamin D.",

This rate will probably rise in the years to come due to the notable tendency among women to delay the decision to become pregnant - values of blood pressure and occurrence of arterial hypertension increase with age, as well as due to the growing problem of obesity resulting from inappropriate dietary habits and lack of regular everyday physical activity. Difficulties with management of that clinical condition are partly related with lack of unified and widely accepted guidelines. Different opinions in the subject of terminology and classification of pregnancy hypertension or indications for pharmacotherapy as well as choice of the optimal antihypertensive drug, emerge from objective causes such as combination of various pathogenetic factors typical for arterial hypertension itself and those connected with pregnancy elsewhere stressed priorities of therapy from the point of view of the health of the mother and of the fetus, as well as lack of randomized clinical trials due to obvious ethical purposes, but also from the fact that pregnancy hypertension is a focus of attention for different specialists - obstetricians, hypertensiologists and perinatologists.

Unfortunately labetalol, nifedipine, hydralazine and sodium nitroprusside are no longer available in Poland, which significantly narrows the practical treatment possibilities in the pregnant population. Inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme and angiotensin II receptor blockers are contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding, as well as aldosteron inhibitors, as suggest in the guidelines.

A scientific committee conducted a comprehensive literature review and worked out with proposals. These proposals were submitted to a vote to the expert panel of CREAK at a national meeting. Proposals that had received the majority were retained. Diagnosis of ACE inhibitor-related AE is based on clinical events. Regarding the severity of the disease, this diagnosis has to be put forward in any patient currently treated with or who has been treated with ACE inhibitors in the previous 6 months. The diagnosis is important because AE does not respond to usual treatment of histamine-induced AE (antihistamines, corticosteroids, and epinephrine), but only to specific treatment of bradykinin-induced AE, as antagonists of bradykinin or concentrates of C1 inhibitor. The subsequent use of ACE is strictly contra-indicated. A report to pharmacovigilance centres of every case is essential.

Enzyme-mediated hydrolysis of phytate in P. vittata extracts was not inhibited by arsenate at 5 mM or by heating at 100 \u00b0C for 10 min. Root exudates of P. vittata exhibited the highest phytase activity (18 nmol Pi mg(-1) protein min(-1)) when available P was low, allowing its growth on media amended with phytate as the sole source of P. Phosphorus concentration in P. vittata gametophyte tissue grown on phytate was equivalent to plants grown with inorganic phosphate at 2208 mg kg(-1), and arsenic was increased from 1777 to 2630 mg kg(-1). After 2 h of mixing with three soils, P. vittata phytase retained more activity, decreasing from \u223c 26 to \u223c 25 nmol Pi mg(-1) protein min(-1), whereas those from Pteris ensiformis and wheat decreased from \u223c 18 to \u223c 1 nmol Pi mg(-1) protein min(-1). These results suggest P. vittata has a uniquely stable phytase enabling its P acquisition in P-limiting soil environments.

Most differences by insurance status were attenuated after adjusting for the site providing care. For example, whereas uninsured patients with left ventricular dysfunction and CAD were less likely to receive ACE-I/ARB therapy (unadjusted RR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.84 to 0.93), this difference was eliminated after adjustment for site (adjusted RR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.88 to 1.03; p = 0.18).",

Consecutive patients with HF were prospectively enrolled from 2000 to 2005 (n = 748). The baseline clinical characteristics, pathology test results, and medication use were compared between those with and without CRA syndrome. The primary end point was all-cause mortality. The mean follow-up was 2.5 \u00b1 1.6 years, with a left ventricular ejection fraction <45% present in 70% of patients. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, \u03b2 blockers, and spironolactone were used in 87%, 67%, and 37%, respectively. CRA syndrome was present in 224 patients (30%). These patients had greater all-cause mortality (51% vs 26%, p <0.001), older age (mean 77 \u00b1 8 vs 67 \u00b1 14 years, p <0.001), and greater rates of diabetes mellitus (35% vs 23%, p <0.001) and ischemic heart disease (50% vs 35%, p <0.001). The independent predictors of mortality were CRA syndrome (hazard ratio 2.0, 95% confidence interval 1.4 to 2.8, p <0.001), left ventricular systolic dysfunction per grade (hazard ratio 1.5, 95% confidence interval 1.3 to 1.8, p <0.001), the absence of a \u03b2 blocker (hazard ratio 1.6, 95% confidence interval 1.1 to 2.2, p = 0.005), New York Heart Association class per class (hazard ratio 1.5, 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 1.9, p <0.01), and age per decade (hazard ratio 1.6, 95% confidence interval 1.4 to 2.0, p <0.001). In conclusion, CRA syndrome was common in patients with HF and was an independent predictor of all-cause mortality.

    "881": "Hypertension is one of the most frequent complications of renal transplantation. About 70% to 90% of this population display either high blood pressure (BP) or require antihypertensive therapy. Diabetes mellitus is also a common finding among kidney transplant recipients. The aim of the study was to assess the BP control among kidney transplant recipients according to the prevalence of diabetes. This retrospective analysis included 172 renal transplant recipients of overall mean age 50 years and 51% males. Hypertension was present in 79% of patients. About one-third of the studied population showed abnormal blood pressures based on office measurements. The cohort was divided into two groups according to the presence of diabetes: group 1, diabetic patients (n = 14) versus group 2, nondiabetics (n = 158). Nondiabetic patients were significantly older than diabetic ones (61.5 versus 49 years; P < .05) and their time after renal transplantation was longer (98.83 versus 67.33 months, P < .05). There was no difference in regard to hypertension prevalence, mean BP value, percentage of abnormal (\u2265 140/90 mm Hg) BP values or glomerular filtration rate. Diabetic patients were prescribed less steroid. The main hypotensive drug used in whole cohort and in no-diabetic patients was a beta-blocker (n = 64, 37%; n = 4, 28%), patients with diabetes used beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors at the same frequency (n = 60, 37%). The main causative factor for hypertension appeared to be the calcineurin inhibitor. More aggressive antihypertensive treatment using combined drugs, including RAS blockers, might provide adequate BP control among renal transplant subjects with high cardiovascular risk.", 
    "882": "Obesity is an increasingly observed pathologic entity in the industrialized world and causally linked to the development of hypertension. Consequently, not only the prevalence of obesity but also the prevalence of obesity hypertension is increasing worldwide. In the context of antihypertensive treatment, data from clinical trials indicate that all first-line antihypertensive drugs possess a similar efficacy in reducing systemic blood pressure and hypertension-related end-organ damage in obese hypertensive subjects. Nevertheless, some antihypertensive agents, such as \u03b2-blockers or thiazide diuretics, may have unwanted side effects on the metabolic and hemodynamic abnormalities that occur in both obesity and hypertension. However, current guidelines still do not include recommendations for state-of-the-art treatment of obese patients with hypertension. Hence, the aim of this article is to provide recommendations for the appropriate use of antihypertensive agents in obese patients mostly based on personal expertise and pathophysiologic assumptions. For instance, thiazide diuretics and \u03b2-blockers are reported to reduce insulin sensitivity and (at least transiently) increase triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, whereas calcium channel blockers are metabolically neutral and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, and renin inhibition may increase insulin sensitivity. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in the adipose tissue has been implicated in the development of arterial hypertension and sodium retention plays a central role in the development of obesity-related hypertension. Therefore, treatment with a blocker of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system and a thiazide diuretic should be considered as first-line antihypertensive drug therapy in obesity hypertension.",

Female (F) and male (M) SHR were divided into 4 experimental groups each (n = 7): sham + vehicle (SV), sham + enalapril (10 mg/kg body weight by gavage), castrated + vehicle, and castrated + enalapril. Treatment began 21 days after castration and continued for 30 days. Serum cytokine levels (ELISA) and ACE activity (fluorimetry) were measured. Male rats exhibited a higher serum ACE activity than female rats. Castration reduced serum ACE in males but did not affect it in females. Enalapril reduced serum ACE in all groups. IL-10 (FSV = 16.4 \u00b1 1.1 pg/mL; MSV = 12.8 \u00b1 1.2 pg/mL), TNF-\u03b1 (FSV = 16.6 \u00b1 1.2 pg/mL; MSV = 12.8 \u00b1 1 pg/mL) and IL-6 (FSV = 10.3 \u00b1 0.2 pg/mL; MSV = 7.2 \u00b1 0.2 pg/mL) levels were higher in females than in males. Ovariectomy reduced all cytokine levels and orchiectomy reduced IL-6 but increased IL-10 concentrations in males. Castration eliminated the differences in all inflammatory cytokine levels (IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1) between males and females. Enalapril increased IL-10 in all groups and reduced IL-6 in SV rats. In conclusion, serum ACE inhibition by enalapril eliminated the sexual dimorphisms of cytokine levels in SV animals, which suggests that enalapril exerts systemic anti-inflammatory and anti-hypertensive effects.",

Multiple subcommittees worked together to review the recent national and international literature on HTN in different areas. We used the evaluation tool that is called \"AGREE\" and considered a score of > 60% as a high score. We adapted the Canadian Hypertension Education Program (CHEP), the United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) and the US-based joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC7). The key topics that are highlighted in this report include: The importance of ambulatory and self-measurement of blood pressure, evaluation of cardiovascular risk in HTN patients, the role of lifestyle modification in the prevention of HTN and its control with more emphasis on salt intake reduction and weight control, introducing pharmacotherapy suitable for uncomplicated HTN or specific situations and the available drugs in Iran, highlighting the importance of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers and calcium channel blockers as the first line therapy in many situations, the non-use of beta blockers as the first time treatment except in specific conditions, treating HTN in women, children, obese and elderly patients, the patient compliance to improve HTN control, practical guidelines to improve the patient's information on knowing their risk and self-care as well as a quick reference guide that can serve as simplified guidelines for physicians. The working team decided to update these recommendations every two years.", 
    "905": "While secretory-leukocyte-protease-inhibitor (SLPI) may promote skin wound healing, its role in infarct healing after reperfused myocardial infarction (RMI) remains unclear. Short-term intravenous angiotensin II (AngII) receptor blocker therapy with candesartan (CN) attenuates increased SLPI and markers of early matrix/left ventricular (LV) in acute RMI. To determine whether reducing effects of AngII with CN or the vasopeptidase inhibitor omapatrilat (OMA) during the healing phase after RMI attenuates SLPI and other mediators of healing and matrix/LV remodeling, we measured these in Sprague-Dawley rats randomized to oral placebo, CN (30 mg/kg/day) or OMA (10 mg/kg/day) therapy during healing between days 2 and 23 after RMI and sham. On day-25, RMI-placebo showed significant LV remodeling, systolic/diastolic dysfunction and impaired passive compliance, and ischemic zone increases in SLPI, secreted-protein-acidic-and-rich-in-cysteine (SPARC) and osteopontin (OPN) mRNA and protein. In addition, metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and -2, a-disintegrin-and-metalloproteinase (ADAM)-10 and -17, inducible-nitric-oxide-synthase (iNOS), pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2(1) and its signaling molecule p-Smad-2, myeloperoxidase (MPO), AngII, MPO-positive granulocytes, MAC387-positive macrophages and monocytes, scar collagens, cardiomyocyte and fibroblast apoptosis, and microvascular no-reflow also increased whereas anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 decreased. Both CN and OMA attenuated all the changes except IL-10, which normalized. Thus, CN or OMA treatment during healing after RMI results in attenuation of SLPI as well as tissue AngII and mediators of inflammation and matrix/LV remodeling including SPARC, OPN, and ADAMs. Whether increasing SLPI on top of background AngII inhibition or therapy such as CN or OMA might produce added remodeling benefit needs study.", 
    "906": "Several large-scale clinical studies have consistently demonstrated that use of inhibitors of renin-angiotensin system such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers was associated with significant reduction of new-onset diabetes in patients with insulin resistance such as primary hypertension. Such observations stimulated major investigations into the interaction of angiotensin and insulin signaling systems, which in turn led to the discovery of a cross talk at several steps between the 2 pathways. Evidence from these clinical trials and from the experimental models of insulin resistance including our findings in ZSF rat and other animal models will be discussed in this review.",

Compared with monotherapy, dual therapy was associated with an 18% reduction in admissions to hospital for heart failure (0.82, 0.74 to 0.92). However, compared with monotherapy, dual therapy was associated with a 55% increase in the risk of hyperkalaemia (P<0.001), a 66% increase in the risk of hypotension (P<0.001), a 41% increase in the risk of renal failure (P=0.01), and a 27% increase in the risk of withdrawal owing to adverse events (P<0.001). Efficacy and safety results were consistent in cohorts with and without heart failure when dual therapy was compared with monotherapy except for all cause mortality, which was higher in the cohort without heart failure (P=0.04 v P=0.15), and renal failure was significantly higher in the cohort with heart failure (P<0.001 v P=0.79).",

In patients with reduction of S100B level due to therapy (positive dynamics, n = 12) we registered significant improvement of some clinical parameters: MMSE, attention level, walking. In patients with increasing of S100B level (negative dynamics, n = 10) we didn't registered improvement of any clinical parameters.

Treatment of NAFLD is currently based on lifestyle measures and no effective pharmacologic treatment is available so far. Emerging evidence, mainly from animal studies, suggests that the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system may be of major importance in the pathogenesis of NAFLD and indicates that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) as a potentially useful therapeutic approach. However, data from human studies are limited and contradictory. In addition, there are few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the effects of ACE-I or ARB in patients with NAFLD and most data are from retrospective studies, pilot prospective studies and post hoc analyses of clinical trials. Accordingly, more and larger RCTs are needed to directly assess the effectiveness of ACE-I and ARBs in NAFLD.",

    "920": "L-Homophenylalanine (L-Hph) is a useful chiral building block for synthesis of several drugs, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and the novel proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib. While the chemoenzymatic route of synthesis is fully developed, we investigated microbial production of L-Hph to explore the possibility of a more efficient and sustainable approach to L-Hph production. We hypothesized that L-Hph is synthesized from L-Phe via a mechanism homologous to 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoic acid conversion to 4-methyl-2-oxopentanoic acid during leucine biosynthesis. Based on bioinformatics analysis, we found three putative homophenylalanine biosynthesis genes, hphA (Npun_F2464), hphB (Npun_F2457), and hphCD (Npun_F2458), in the cyanobacterium Nostoc punctiforme PCC73102, located around the gene cluster responsible for anabaenopeptin biosynthesis. We constructed Escherichia coli strains harboring hphABCD-expressing plasmids and achieved the fermentative production of L-Hph from L-Phe. To our knowledge, this is the first identification of the genes responsible for homophenylalanine synthesis in any organism. Furthermore, to improve the low conversion efficiency of the initial strain, we optimized the expression of hphA, hphB, and hphCD, which increased the yield to \u223c630 mg/liter. The L-Hph biosynthesis and L-Leu biosynthesis genes from E. coli were also compared. This analysis revealed that HphB has comparatively relaxed substrate specificity and can perform the function of LeuB, but HphA and HphCD show tight substrate specificity and cannot complement the LeuA and LeuC/LeuD functions, and vice versa. Finally, the range of substrate tolerance of the L-Hph-producing strain was examined, which showed that m-fluorophenylalanine, o-fluorophenylalanine, and L-tyrosine were accepted as substrates and that the corresponding homoamino acids were generated.",

    "926": "Since the initial discovery of Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) in the 1960s and the launch of Captopril as the first available for clinical use in the 1970s, there now exist three other classes of drugs that block the renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS): the angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), aldosterone antagonists (AA) and direct renin inhibitors (DRI). With the proven efficacy of RAAS blockers as monotherapy in many arenas there has been considerable interest in the use of dual therapy combinations of these medications that target different points in the pathway. By potentially offering a more complete RAAS blockade with a commensurate enhanced clinical effect, the strong biological rationale for dual therapy has led to it being embraced by clinicians as a treatment option, for hypertension and nephroprotection in particular. However, the initial enthusiasm for this treatment has been tempered by the recent results from several large trials such as ONTARGET and ALTITUDE, which do not support a specific dual therapy approach. In contrast, there is supportive evidence for dual blockade of specific combinations in selected patient groups and data are lacking for others. In the wake of this complex contemporary evidence, the conundrum now faced by clinicians committed to individualised care is, for which patients dual therapy could still be of benefit. This review examines for the practising clinician the current 'state of play' for dual blockade of various combinations and a perspective on its use in cardio-renal disease and diabetic complications.",

AKI was unrecognized in 23.5% of patients, two-thirds of whom were discharged without resolution of renal function.

    "933": "Heart failure is one of the leading causes of death in developed countries, and its prevalence is expected to increase further in the coming years. While the pharmacokinetic changes observed in patients with heart failure have been reviewed twice in Clinical Pharmacokinetics, approximately a quarter century has passed since the latest article was published in 1988. Since then, many important classes of agents (e.g. ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor antagonists and inotropes) have been introduced for the treatment of heart failure. The aim of the present article is to update the information regarding the pharmacokinetics of these drugs. For this purpose we have made a systematic survey of literature using MEDLINE, EMBASE and Japan Centra Revuo Medicina (in Japanese) and found a total of 111 relevant publications for 58 drugs. Heart failure is a pathophysiological state where the damaged heart, from whatever causes, no longer pumps enough blood for the needs of body tissues at rest or during the normal daily activities. The spectrum of heart failure ranges from acute decompensated heart failure (including circulatory shock) to chronic compensated or decompensated heart failure. Because hypoperfusion of organs may influence drug absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, distribution into tissues and elimination either by the liver or kidneys, it is conceivable that the pharmacokinetics of many drugs may be altered in patients with heart failure. The pharmacokinetic changes of drugs in these patients in the light of a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model are discussed, since this model can interpret altered pharmacokinetics in terms of changes in the binding of drugs in plasma and tissue, blood flow to drug-eliminating organs and intrinsic activity of drug elimination. Pharmacokinetic changes of drugs after intravenous administration are described here in Part 1 and those after oral administration will be discussed in Part 2 in a later issue of the Clinical Pharmacokinetics. Reviewing the retrieved data, it was considered that patients with asymptomatic or compensated chronic heart failure seem to have no or minimal alterations in the pharmacokinetics of parenterally administered drugs as long as there was no concurrent liver and/or kidney dysfunction. In contrast, it was found that the systemic clearance of at least six drugs (i.e. milrinone, carperitide, molsidomine, theophylline, ciclosporin and hydralazine) was reduced after intravenous administration by 50 % or more in patients with acute decompensated heart failure or chronic severe heart failure (New York Heart Association class III or IV) as compared with healthy subjects. Because there is a paucity of information regarding the pharmacokinetics of drugs in patients with severe heart failure, close attention should be paid to monitoring the efficacy of these agents and their associated adverse effects.", 
    "934": "This study tested the hypothesis that Rho kinase contributes to the enhanced pressor response to acute angiotensin II in intact male growth-restricted and gonadectomized female growth-restricted rats. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and renal function were determined in conscious animals pretreated with enalapril (250 mg/l in drinking water) for 1 wk to block the endogenous renin-angiotensin system and normalize blood pressure (baseline). Blood pressure and renal hemodynamics did not differ at baseline. Acute Ang II (100 ng\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7min(-1)) induced a greater increase in MAP and renal vascular resistance and enhanced reduction in glomerular filtration rate in intact male growth-restricted rats compared with intact male controls (P < 0.05). Cotreatment with the Rho kinase inhibitor fasudil (33 \u03bcg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7min(-1)) significantly attenuated these hemodynamic changes (P < 0.05), but it did not abolish the differential increase in blood pressure above baseline, suggesting that the impact of intrauterine growth restriction on blood pressure in intact male growth-restricted rats is independent of Rho kinase. Gonadectomy in conjunction with fasudil returned blood pressure back to baseline in male growth-restricted rats, and yet glomerular filtration rate remained significantly reduced (P < 0.05). Thus, these data suggest a role for enhanced renal sensitivity to acute Ang II in the developmental programming of hypertension in male growth-restricted rats. However, inhibition of Rho kinase had no effect on the basal or enhanced increase in blood pressure induced by acute Ang II in the gonadectomized female growth-restricted rat. Therefore, these studies suggest that Rho kinase inhibition exerts a sex-specific effect on blood pressure sensitivity to acute Ang II in growth-restricted rats.",

    "938": "Hypertension is one of the most important clinical conditions affecting older people. Its prevalence in this group of subjects is above 60% and continues to grow. Isolated systolic hypertension accounts for the majority of cases as systolic blood pressure increases with advancing age, while diastolic blood pressure remains unchanged or even decreases. Nowadays hypertension is a well established risk factor for stroke and cardiovascular disease among older people and its treatment is considered mandatory. The general recommended blood pressure goal in uncomplicated hypertension is less than 140/90 mmHg, even if this target in older people is based mainly on expert opinion. All patients should receive nonpharmacological treatment, in particular reduction in excess body weight when body mass index is greater than 26 kg/m(2) and dietary salt restriction. Older patients with hypertension may also benefit from smoking cessation, physical activity and alcohol restriction. In relation to drug therapy, a low-dose thiazide diuretic could be a good first step. Other first-line drugs are long-acting calcium channel blockers, generally dihydropyridines, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers. The HYVET study showed a specific protective effect of indapamide with or without perindopril in people older than 80 years. Since monotherapy normalizes blood pressure in only 40-50% of cases, a combination of two or more drugs is often required. Moreover the addiction of a second drug may reduce the dose-related adverse effects of the first one. Finally, compliance with treatment should always be achieved by giving complete information to patients and simplifying the drug regimen as much as possible.", 
    "939": "Hypertension is an important risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The importance of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in cardiovascular and renal diseases has long been recognized: for this reason the conventional therapies, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), \u03b2-blockers, and aldosterone antagonists represent the backbone of current antihypertensive therapy. Aliskiren is the first direct renin inhibitor (DRI) suitable for oral administration. By achieving more complete renin-angiotensin system inhibition, direct renin inhibitors may afford greater protection from hypertensive complications. Present evidence indicates that aliskiren reduces baseline systolic and diastolic blood pressure greater than placebo and that it is as effective as other first-line antihypertensive agents. Extra advantages can be reached when it is used in combination therapy. Clinical trials and in vitro studies also suggest that aliskiren has several cardioprotective and renoprotective effects. Therapy with aliskiren is well tolerated, but recently some concerns have arisen because of the early termination of the ALTITUDE study due to an increased incidence of adverse effects.",

By univariate analysis, the duration of sustained AF (p <0.001), left atrial diameter (p = 0.010), left atrial volume index (p = 0.017), and early AF recurrence (p <0.001) were significantly associated with AF recurrence, and the use of eplerenone was associated with maintenance of sinus rhythm after RFCA (p = 0.022). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that longer duration of sustained AF (>3 years) (p <0.001) and early AF recurrence (p <0.001) were significantly associated with AF recurrence, and only eplerenone therapy significantly improved maintenance of sinus rhythm (p = 0.017). In conclusion, eplerenone significantly improved maintenance of sinus rhythm after RFCA in patients with long-standing persistent AF.",

However, it has been reported that oxidative stress is involved in the transduction of the effects of haemodynamic and metabolic pathological conditions. Thus, drugs acting on the renin-angiotensin system [angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers], or on the glucose or lipid metabolism as substrate of oxidative mechanisms (statins and nutraceuticals) in association with a dietary restriction may be taken in account, because they play a synergistic effect in preventing functional and structural changes responsible for the high cardiovascular risk in metabolic syndrome.",

Because of the widespread use of Lactobacillus helveticus in cheese technology, information concerning the heterogeneity in this species is accumulating rapidly. Recently, the genome of five L. helveticus strains was sequenced to completion and compared with other genomically characterized lactobacilli. The genomic analysis of the first sequenced strain, L. helveticus DPC 4571, isolated from cheese and selected for its characteristics of rapid lysis and high proteolytic activity, has revealed a plethora of genes with industrial potential including those responsible for key metabolic functions such as proteolysis, lipolysis, and cell lysis. These genes and their derived enzymes can facilitate the production of cheese and cheese derivatives with potential for use as ingredients in consumer foods. In addition, L. helveticus has the potential to produce peptides with a biological function, such as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity, in fermented dairy products, demonstrating the therapeutic value of this species. A most intriguing feature of the genome of L. helveticus is the remarkable similarity in gene content with many intestinal lactobacilli. Comparative genomics has allowed the identification of key gene sets that facilitate a variety of lifestyles including adaptation to food matrices or the gastrointestinal tract. As genome sequence and functional genomic information continues to explode, key features of the genomes of L. helveticus strains continue to be discovered, answering many questions but also raising many new ones.",

Genistein and the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril are two agents shown to protect the hematopoietic system from radiation injury. In this study we examined the combination of genistein with captopril for reduction of radiation-induced mortality from hematopoietic damage and the mechanisms of radiation protection. C57BL/6J mice were exposed to 8.25Gy (60)Co total body irradiation (TBI) to evaluate the effects of genistein and captopril alone and in combination on survival, blood cell recovery, hematopoietic progenitor cell recovery, DNA damage, and erythropoietin production. 8.25Gy TBI resulted in 0% survival after 30days in untreated mice. A single subcutaneous injection of genistein administered 24h before TBI resulted in 72% survival. Administration of captopril in the drinking water, from 1h through 30days postirradiation, increased survival to 55%. Genistein plus captopril increased survival to 95%. Enhanced survival was reflected in a reduction of radiation-induced anemia, improved recovery of nucleated bone marrow cells, splenocytes and circulating red blood cells. The drug combination enhanced early recovery of marrow progenitors: erythroid (CFU-E and BFU-E), and myeloid (CFU-GEMM, CFU-GM and CFU-M). Genistein alone and genistein plus captopril protected hematopoietic progenitor cells from radiation-induced micronuclei, while captopril had no effect. Captopril alone and genistein plus captopril, but not genistein alone, suppressed radiation-induced erythropoietin production. These data suggest that genistein and captopril protect the hematopoietic system from radiation injury via independent mechanisms.",

Rat aortic rings suspended in organ chambers were used to investigate the vascular reactivity of FA-I. Effect of FA-I on BK was studied by in vitro and in vivo methods. Results show that FA-I significantly (P < 0.05) decreased the contraction evoked by Ang I and Ang II. In the presence of indomethacin (10 \u00b5M) or N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (0.1 \u00b5M), the inhibitory effect of FA-I on Ang II-induced contraction of aortic rings was reduced. Besides, FA-I potentiated the vasorelaxant effect and enhanced the blood pressure-lowering effect of BK. In conclusion, FA-I reduced the contraction evoked by Ang II probably via the endothelium-dependent pathways, which involve activation of the release of nitric oxide and prostaglandins. The inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme activity by FA-I may contribute to the potentiation of the effects of BK on cardiovascular system.",

The aim of this study is to explore whether and by what mechanisms osthole protects lipopolysaccharide(LPS)-induced acute lung injury. Herein, we found that osthole had a beneficial effect on LPS-induced ALI in mice. As revealed by survival study, pretreatment with high doses of osthole reduced the mortality of mice from ALI. Osthole pretreatment significantly improved LPS-induced lung pathological changes, reduced lung wet/dry weight ratios and total protein in BALF. Osthole also inhibited the release of inflammatory mediators TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6. Meanwhile, osthole markedly prevented the loss of ACE2 and Ang1-7 in lung tissue of ALI mice.

Sarcopenia is currently a major focus for drug discovery and development although there remains debate about the best primary outcome measure for trials, and various promising avenues to date have proved unsatisfactory. The concept of 'new tricks for old drugs' is, however, promising, for example, there is some evidence that the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may improve physical performance.

In the presence of the inhibitor cocktail, \u2265 98% \u00b1 2% of cardiac (125)I-Ang-(1-12) remained intact, whereas exclusion of chymostatin from the inhibitor cocktail led to significant conversion of Ang-(1-12) into Ang II. In addition, chymase-mediated hydrolysis of (125)I-Ang I was higher compared with Ang-(1-12). Negligible Ang-(1-12) hydrolysis occurred by ACE, ACE2, and neprilysin. A high chymase activity was detected for both (125)I-Ang-(1-12) and (125)I-Ang I substrates. Chymase accounts for the conversion of Ang-(1-12) and Ang I to Ang II in normal human LV. These novel findings expand knowledge of the alternate mechanism by which Ang-(1-12) contributes to the production of cardiac angiotensin peptides.",

Subsequently, T. violacea (60\u2009mg/kg) or muscarine (2.5\u2009\u03bcg/kg) was infused into eight SHRs, 20\u2009min after atropine (5.12\u2009mg/kg) pre-treatment. In the chronic (21\u2009days) experiments, the SHRs were randomly divided into three groups, and given the vehicle (0.2\u2009ml/day of DMSO and NS), T. violacea (60\u2009mg/kg/day) and captopril (10\u2009mg/kg/day) respectively into the peritoneum, to investigate their effects on blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and plasma aldosterone levels.

Masters swimmer data were obtained from a one-time survey of all United States Masters Swimming (USMS) members. Both datasets included demographics, drug therapy, diseases and health status. Characteristics of swimming sessions as well as perceptions of impact of medications on exercise were also collected from the USMS respondents. Of 1346 completed surveys from USMS respondents, 15.8% self-identified as having hypertension while 36.2% participants in the NHANES survey suffered from hypertension (P < 0.001). The two groups were well matched for age and gender but the USMS group was primarily Caucasian, higher income, higher education, and reported higher health status. In the USMS group, not only was hypertension less prevalent but those who suffered from hypertension took fewer medications (P = 0.04) to manage their hypertension than in the NHANES group. Additionally, The USMS group suffering from hypertension considered themselves healthier (P < 0.001) than the NHANES group.", 
    "1012": "The aim of this paper was to investigate whether the effects of QSYQ on CHD are associated with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). The formula groups were lavaged with QSYQ, using fosinopril sodium as a control. The level of RAAS components in the myocardial tissue was measured, respectively. The results showed that both QSYQ and fosinopril sodium can improve the ejection fraction in CHD and that QSYQ decreases the left ventricular end-systolic diameter and left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, while fosinopril sodium has no effects on these parameters. Fosinopril sodium, as an ACE inhibitor, downregulated ACE expression and eventually reduced the tissue AngII concentration but had no effect on ACE2. Moreover, it had no effect on renin or AT2, while QSYQ significantly decreased the level of renin and expression of AngII in myocardial tissue. The results also revealed that QSYQ can act on both AT1 and AT2, thus, blocking the effect of AngII and increasing the level of ACE2. It also downregulated the levels of TGF-\u03b2 and MMP-9, but it had no effect on ACE. This study showed that the ameliorative effects of QSYQ on CHD in rats had multiple targets associated with the inhibition of RAAS, thus, producing cardioprotective therapy effects.",

This sign is similar to acute myocardial infarction but without significant coronary artery stenosis. There are important and essential differences between Takotsubo cardiomyopathy and acute myocardial infarction in terms of management, necessitating a good understanding of the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of the former.We report a case of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy which presented with dizziness and near syncope after an intense emotional stress. Electrocardiogram showed ST-T changes in V1-V3 and echocardiography revealed severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction with marked regional wall motion abnormalities. Coronary angiography demonstrated minimal coronary artery disease.The patient was treated with beta -blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, Aspirin, Clopidogrel, and diuretics.

    "1014": "On the basis of evidence that within the adult kidney, the aldo-keto reductase AKR1B7 (aldo-keto reductase family 1, member 7, also known as mouse vas deferens protein, MVDP) is selectively expressed in renin-producing cells, we aimed to define a possible role of AKR1B7 for the regulation and function of renin cells in the kidney. We could confirm colocalization and corecruitment of renin and of AKR1B7 in wild-type kidneys. Renin cells in AKR1B7-deficient kidneys showed normal morphology, numbers, and intrarenal distribution. Plasma renin concentration (PRC) and renin mRNA levels of AKR1B7-deficient mice were normal at standard chow and were lowered by a high-salt diet directly comparable to wild-type mice. Treatment with a low-salt diet in combination with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor strongly increased PRC and renin mRNA in a similar fashion both in AKR1B7-deficient and wild-type mice. Under this condition, we also observed a strong retrograde recruitment of renin-expressing cell along the preglomerular vessels, however, without a difference between AKR1B7-deficient and wild-type mice. The isolated perfused mouse kidney model was used to study the acute regulation of renin secretion by ANG II and by perfusion pressure. Regarding these parameters, no differences were observed between AKR1B7-deficient and wild-type kidneys. In summary, our data suggest that AKR1B7 is not of major relevance for the regulation of renin production and secretion in spite of its striking coregulation with renin expression.",

This survey was undertaken to assess the status quo of primary care management of hypertension in patients with the high-risk comorbid diseases metabolic syndrome (MetS) and/or type 2 diabetes mellitus (non-insulin depending diabetes mellitus (NIDDM)). Data of anti-hypertensive treatment of 4594 Swiss patients were collected over 1 week. We identified patients with exclusively NIDDM (N\u00a0=\u00a095), MetS (N\u00a0=\u00a0168), and both (N\u00a0=\u00a0768). Target blood pressure (TBP) attainment, frequency of prescribed substance-classes, and correlations to comorbidities/end-organ damages were assessed. In addition, we analyzed the prescription of unfavorable beta-blockers (BB) and high-dose diuretics (Ds). In NIDDM, Ds (61%), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) (40%), and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) (31%) were mostly prescribed, while in MetS, drugs prevalence was Ds (68%), ARBs (48%), and BB (41%). Polypharmacy in patients with MetS correlated with body mass index; older patients (>65\u00a0years) were more likely to receive dual-free combinations. TBP was attained in 25.2% of NIDDM and in 28.7% of MetS patients. In general, low-dose Ds use was more prevalent in NIDDM and MetS, however, overall, Ds were used excessively (NIDDM: 61%, MetS: 68%), especially in single-pill combination. Patients with MetS were more likely to receive ARBs, ACEIs, CCBs, and low-dose Ds than BBs and/or high-dose Ds. Physicians recognize DM and MetS as high-risk patients, but select inappropriate drugs. Because the majority of patients may have both, MetS and NIDDM, there is an unmet need to define TBP for this specific population considering the increased risk in comparison to patients with MetS or NIDDM alone.", 
    "1016": "BACKGROUND Pre-eclampsia has a clear familial component, suggesting that the condition may be partly attributable to genetic susceptibility. The search for susceptibility genes has led to a drastic increase in the number of published studies associating genetic factors with pre-eclampsia. However, attempts to replicate these findings have yielded inconsistent results. This meta-analysis assessed the pooled effect of each genetic variant that is reproducibly associated with pre-eclampsia. METHODS Studies that assessed the association between genes and pre-eclampsia were searched in PubMed, Embase and Web of Science. We selected all genetic variants that were significantly associated with pre-eclampsia in an initial study and were subsequently independently reproduced in at least one additional study. All studies that assessed these reproduced variants were then included. The association between genetic variants and pre-eclampsia was calculated at the allele level, and the main measure of effect was a pooled odds ratio in a random-effects model. RESULTS The literature search yielded 2965 articles, of which 542 investigated genetic associations in pre-eclampsia. We identified 22 replicated genetic variants, of which 7 remained significantly associated with pre-eclampsia following meta-analysis. These variants were in or near the following genes: ACE, CTLA4, F2, FV, LPL and SERPINE1. CONCLUSIONS This meta-analysis identified seven genetic variants associated with pre-eclampsia. Importantly, many of these variants are also risk factors for developing cardiovascular disease, revealing that pre-eclampsia and cardiovascular disease have shared genetic risk factors. The contribution of the identified genetic variants in the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia should be the focus of future studies.",

The objective of this study was to investigate the possible association of a functional polymorphism in the ACE gene, which affects its transcription, with risk for BCC. In DNA samples of 92 patients with BCC and 103 healthy controls of Greek origin and comparable age and gender, we studied the ACE gene insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism. Fisher's exact test was used for comparison of allele and genotype frequencies between the control and patients' groups. The detected low expression I allele frequency in the group of BCC patients was significantly decreased compared to controls (15.8 vs. 31.1 %, respectively; P = 0.001). ID heterozygotes exhibited 3.06 times lower BCC risk, compared with DD homozygotes (P = 0.001; OR = 0.327, 95 % CI = 0.174-0.615). The protective role of I allele was particularly prominent in women (P = 0.007, OR = 0.299, 95 % CI = 0.125-0.716), while for men it exhibited a marginal level (P = 0.041). These findings indicate that the low expression ACE I allele carriers have a decreased risk for BCC. The protective effect of the ID genotype against BCC may be explained by a possible underlying mechanism involving the effect of produced angiotensin II levels on its receptors due to putatively different binding affinity.",

    "1030": "Therapeutic proteins have the potential to elicit immune responses in animals and humans (Mire-Sluis et al., 2004; Yu et al., 2006; Shankar et al., 2008). Contributors to the response could include product related factors such as chemical modifications, impurities that co-purify with product, contaminants, formulation, aggregates, and clinical factors such as dose concentration, dosing frequency, route of drug administration, rate of administration, patient underlying disease, concomitant medication, and genetic status among others (Patten and Schellekens, 2003). Further, an immune response triggered by a therapeutic enzyme may neutralize the endogenous counterpart resulting in a decrease or depletion of the therapeutic and endogenous enzymes imposing safety concerns for patients. Therefore, monitoring of anti-drug antibody (ADA) and neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses to both the recombinant therapeutic enzyme and endogenous enzyme is important during early development and subsequent clinical studies. Testing considerations for NAb detection against therapeutic enzymes have been published mostly for lysosomal storage diseases (Wang et al., 2008). NAb cross-reactivity to the endogenous counterpart has also been characterized (Sominanda et al., 2010). Here, we describe an enzymatic NAb assay which detects neutralizing antibodies to both recombinant and endogenous angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). NAb assay sensitivity was optimized by selecting the assay incubation time as 20 min with an enzyme concentration of 0.5 \u03bcg/mL. Four anti-ACE2 antibodies out of a commercial panel of 18 were found to have neutralizing capabilities based upon their ability to abrogate ACE2 enzymatic activity. We demonstrated assay specificity by small peptide inhibitors specific for ACE or ACE2. DX600, an ACE2 specific inhibitor did not cross-react with ACE. Conversely, captopril, an inhibitor of ACE did not inhibit ACE2. The assay specificity for ACE2 neutralizing antibodies was further demonstrated by the lack of reactivity of two species control antibodies and 14 anti-ACE2 antibodies. Moreover, we demonstrated assay specificity to human endogenous ACE2 from human epithelial cells. Three human cell lines (Calu-3, Caco-2, Huh-7) were evaluated for the cell surface expression of ACE2 by flow cytometry and Western blot. Subsequently, whole cell lysates, cell culture supernatant, and live cells were evaluated in the assay. Results demonstrated that Calu-3 had elevated levels of ACE2 compared to Caco-2 or Huh-7. Calu-3 also demonstrated elevated ACE2 enzymatic activity in all three sources and could be inhibited by the ACE2 specific inhibitor DX600 as well as the neutralizing antibodies for the recombinant ACE2. Thus, we describe here a method to detect NAb against a therapeutic enzyme and assess NAb cross-reactivity to the native endogenous enzyme. The approach of method development described here could be applied for the assessment of NAb responses to other enzymatic therapeutics.", 
    "1031": "IRW is an egg ovotransferrin-derived ACE inhibitory peptide. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the stability and transcellular transport of IRW in Caco-2 cell monolayers. The stability of IRW was monitored on the apical (AP) surface while its transport was studied from AP to basal (BL) and from BL to AP surfaces. The results revealed that IRW is resistant against intestinal peptidase up to 60 min. Transport of IRW was not affected by addition of wortamanin, a transcytosis inhibitor. However, in the presence of cytochalasin D, a gap junction disruptor, transport of IRW was significantly increased, suggesting a possible passive transport from AP to BL surface. A higher transport of IRW from AP to BL surface than that from BL to AP surface suggests a passive-mediated transport. Moreover, in the presence of glycyl-sarcosine, a substrate for peptide transporter PepT 1, transport of IRW was reduced from AP to BL surface. The above observations showed atypical transport of IRW in Caco-2 cell monolayers. Thus, IRW may possibly be absorbed intact into the site of action for controlling hypertension.",

Attaining this goal would require treating 26 percent of the population at a cost of $34-$36 per quality-adjusted life-year. Offering the polypill to women at high risk and to men age fifty-five or older would be the best approach and would yield acceptable incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. The polypill would be very cost-effective even in the country with the lowest gross national income in our study.

Many studies have demonstrated increased oxidant stress in diabetic patients and animal models of diabetes mellitus. In this study, the effect of liver hydrolysate administration on the blood glucose was examined in SHR/NDmcr-cp (SHR-cp) rats that show spontaneously occurring metabolic syndrome-like abnormalities. The SHR-cp rats were fed diets containing 5% liver hydrolysate for 12 weeks, and the fasting blood glucose and HbA1c were determined every 3 weeks. After administration of the liver hydrolysate-containing feed for 12 weeks, an oral glucose tolerance test was conducted and the plasma angiotensin II (AngII) concentrations were determined. The liver hydrolysate administration had no effect on the blood insulin levels in the oral glucose tolerance test, but significantly inhibited the d-glucose-induced increases of the blood glucose levels. Furthermore, the liver hydrolysate had almost no effect on the fasting blood glucose level, but tended to inhibit the increase of HbA1c. The plasma AngII concentration after the 12-week administration of liver hydrolysate remained significantly lower than that in the control group. These results indicate that a component of liver hydrolysate inhibits d-glucose-induced increase of the blood glucose level, and may improve insulin resistance. The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibiting effect and antioxidant effect of liver hydrolysate may be involved in this effect.",

Furthermore, the effects of LH-I and LH-II on the blood pressure were examined in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The results showed that peptides and amino acids accounted for 70% or more of the constituents of both LH-I and LH-II.

These findings indicate that both LH-I and LH-II have antioxidant activity and ACE-inhibiting activity. Moreover, both exerted a blood pressure-lowering effect in SHR.

    "1046": "Infusion of enalaprilat resulted in a significant reduction in index of microvascular resistance (27 \u00b1 11 at baseline vs. 19 \u00b1 9 after drug vs. 15 \u00b1 8 after PCI), whereas a significant post-procedural increase in index of microvascular resistance levels was observed in the placebo group (24 \u00b1 15 at baseline vs. 24 \u00b1 15 after drug vs. 33 \u00b1 19 after PCI). Index of microvascular resistance levels after PCI were significantly lower in the enalaprilat group (p < 0.001). Patients pre-treated with enalaprilat also showed lower peak values (mean: 21.7 ng/ml, range: 8.2 to 34.8 ng/ml vs. mean: 32.3 ng/ml, range: 12.6 to 65.2 ng/ml, p = 0.048) and peri-procedural increases of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (mean: 9.9 ng/ml, range: 2.7 to 19.0 ng/ml vs. mean: 26.6 ng/ml, range: 6.3 to 60.5 ng/ml, p = 0.025).",

Larger studies are warranted to investigate whether these effects of enalaprilat could result into a significant clinical benefit.", 
    "1048": "Danish (including Greenland and the Faroe Islands) and international guidelines were reviewed to determine to which extent they recommend the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) before spinal anaesthesia.", 
    "1049": "A total of 50 Danish departments of anaesthesia and 30 societies of anaesthesiology were invited by e-mail to detail their guidelines on pre-anaesthesia ACE inhibitor and ARB use and the number of registered deaths due to hypotension. PubMed was searched for existing guidelines.", 
    "1050": "Seven of 31 responding departments in Denmark had issued guidelines. None of 11 responding societies except the French had issued guidelines. The French society recommended discontinuation of ACE inhibitors and ARBs for hypotension > 12 hours before surgery, but no discontinuation in case of heart failure. None of the societies reported deaths.", 
    "1051": "A minority of the responding Danish departments of anaesthesia and the French Society of Anaesthesiologists have issued guidelines on the use of ACE inhibitors and ARB, but extant literature is scant and equivocal, and no randomized trials have studied either the indications for or the adverse outcome of ACE inhibitors and ARB treatment.", 
    "1052": "Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disease. Evidence suggests that tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) is important in the pathophysiology, and TNF-\u03b1-inhibitors such as infliximab are therefore used against sarcoidosis refractory to traditional therapies or where side effects to these are intolerable. The aim of this retrospect-ive study was to investigate the effect of infliximab on refractory sarcoidosis.", 
    "1053": "Twelve patients were treated with infliximab and their medical records were reviewed. Efficiency was evaluated based on changes in P-angiotensin-converting enzyme (P-ACE) and P-interleukin-2 (P-IL-2), pulmonary function tests and chest radiographs (stage I-IV) after seven treatments and at the end of treatment. The effect of infliximab on extrapulmonary sarcoidosis was described separately for ocular and cutaneous sarcoidosis.", 
    "1054": "Patients with pulmonary symptoms (n = 9) obtained an average increase in forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), total lung capacity (TLC) and diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (TLCO) after treatment with infliximab. One patient with radiographic stage I at baseline obtained a normal radiograph after treatment. Changes in radiographic staging were observed for no other patients. The mean value of both P-ACE and P-IL-2 in patients with raised values pre-treatment (n = 6) decreased to values within the reference interval after treatment. Furthermore, infliximab had a steroid sparing effect on ocular sarcoidosis (n = 2) and an effect on cutaneous sarcoidosis (n = 2) based on clinical evaluations.",

We examined the association between RVO and the above polymorphisms under a per-allele genetic model in a Greek unrelated case/control population. Additionally, searching PubMed up to January 2012, we identified existing evidence on these polymorphisms and performed meta-analyses.", 
    "1058": "A total of three polymorphisms had nominally significant associations with RVO. These associations pertained to ACE D allele (odds ratio, OR, 2.08 [95% CI, 1.12-3.85], p = 0.02); factor XIII 34Leu allele (OR = 0.41 [95% CI, 0.18-0.95], p = 0.037] and MTHFR 677T variant (OR = 2.20 [95% CI 1.10-4.40], p = 0.026). We performed a meta-analysis on the associations between RVO and PAI-1 (n = 5), factor V Leiden (n = 21), MTHFR C677T (n = 19) and prothrombin G20210A (n = 21). We observed nominally significant associations only for PAI-1 (OR = 1.27 [95% CI, 1.02-1.60, p = 0.036]) (I(2) = 44.7%), and factor V Leiden (OR = 1.40 [95% CI, 1.07-1.84, p = 0.015]) (I(2) = 3.6%) using random effects model.", 
    "1059": "Our results suggest that there may be an association between increased risk for RVO and ACE I/D, MTHFR C677T, PAI-1 4G/5G and factor V Leiden polymorphisms, whereas the Val34Leu variant may exert a protective effect.", 
    "1060": "COPD and hypertension both increase the risk of congestive heart failure (CHF). Current clinical trials do not inform the selection of combination antihypertensive therapy among patients with COPD. We performed a comparative effectiveness study to investigate whether choice of dual agent antihypertensive therapy is associated with risk of hospitalization for CHF among patients with these two conditions.", 
    "1061": "We identified a cohort of 7,104 patients with COPD and hypertension receiving care within Veterans Administration hospitals between January 2001 and December 2006, with follow-up through April 2009. We included only patients prescribed two antihypertensive medications. We used Cox proportional hazard models for statistical analysis.", 
    "1062": "Compared with \u03b2-blockers plus an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin II receptor blocker, patients prescribed a thiazide diuretic plus a \u03b2-blocker (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.49; 95% CI, 0.32-0.75), a thiazide plus an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin II receptor blocker (adjusted HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.35-0.71), and a thiazide plus a calcium channel blocker (adjusted HR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.35-0.88) had a significantly lower risk of hospitalization for CHF. After stratification by history of CHF, we found that this association was isolated to patients without a history of CHF. Adjustment for patient characteristics and comorbidities had a small effect on risk of hospitalization. Choice of antihypertensive medication combination had no significant association with risk of COPD exacerbation.", 
    "1063": "Among patients with comorbid hypertension and COPD requiring two antihypertensive agents, combination therapy that includes a thiazide diuretic was associated with a significantly lower risk of hospitalization for CHF among patients without a history of CHF.", 
    "1064": "Successful treatment of hypertension often requires the association of drugs from different classes. Combination therapy takes advantage of complementary mechanisms of action, in order to reach target blood pressure (BP) earlier and to minimize the side effects of medications. In the last decade, several randomized trials have demonstrated the efficacy of combining a renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitor with a calcium channel blocker (CCB) or with a diuretic in different populations. The ACCOMPLISH trial was the only large clinical trial that directly compared the two combination strategies. In hypertensive individuals at high cardiovascular risk, benazepril plus amlodipine was superior to benazepril plus hydrochlorothiazide in reducing the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular events plus death from cardiovascular causes. Small randomized trials have evaluated the two combination therapies in surrogate endpoints, such as microalbuminuria, with contrasting results. Current European and American guidelines recommend combination therapy as first-line when BP is at least 20/10 mmHg above treatment goals. However, the choice of the best combination therapy is still debated: the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines recommend a RAAS inhibitor plus a CCB, while the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure guidelines underline the pivotal role of thiazide diuretics. The combination of a RAAS inhibitor with a CCB demonstrated the best efficacy in reducing cardiovascular endpoint. However, the combination of a RAAS inhibitor with a diuretic has shown beneficial results in particular subgroup of patients, such as patients with heart failure or with African American origin. This review will focus on the rationale and current evidences about combination therapy in the management of arterial hypertension.", 
    "1065": "The aim of this study was to assess the influence of selected cardiovascular and antidiabetic drugs on in vitro pepsin activity. A total of 13 drugs were analyzed at one concentration (one tablet of drug in 50 mL of solution with deionized water). The enzyme activity was determined by the Folin method based on the reaction of tyrosine with the Folin reagent. It was found that ACE inhibitors (apo-perindox, prinvil, gopten) caused a significant decrease in the activity of pepsin, while indapen (a diuretic) and glucophage (an antidiabetic drug) increased the activity of this enzyme. It can be concluded that indapamide, metformin and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors influenced pepsin activity and these drugs can affect the digestion process in the patients undergoing treatment."
