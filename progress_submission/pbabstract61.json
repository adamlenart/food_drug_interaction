    "0": "Pharmacologic interruption of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) is considered a standard therapeutic intervention for patients with chronic renal disease, regardless of whether systemic hypertension is present. The advent of orally active angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) increases the number of therapeutic options for inhibiting the RAS in patients with chronic renal diseases. Clinical studies of ARB that can be compared with large-scale ACEI clinical trials have yet to be completed. More than a dozen experimental studies comparing ARB with ACEI suggest that the two classes of drugs share similar renoprotective properties. Like ACEI, ARB are effective antihypertensive and antiproteinuric agents, which greatly reduce glomerular and tubulointerstitial scarring. Although both reduce stimulation of the AT1 receptor, ARB lack the kinin-potentiating effects of ACEI. ARB may exert antifibrotic actions via the AT2 receptor, through increased levels of angiotensin II resulting from AT1 receptor blockade. Despite these pharmacologic distinctions, recent studies have not detected differences in renoprotection between ARB and ACEI. In the context of RAS inhibition, the magnitude of antihypertensive and antiproteinuric effects achieved appears to be the major determinant of renoprotection, not the class of drug used. Thus, experimental data suggest that ARB will fulfill their promise as effective agents to be used as mainstays in multifaceted clinical strategies designed to slow or arrest the progression of chronic renal disease. Confirmation of this view awaits the results of clinical trials.", 
    "1": "Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system is recognized as an effective approach for the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure. It is possible to antagonize the effects of angiotensin II (AngII) by blocking its receptors, using nonpeptide receptor antagonists. Six angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) have been approved for the treatment of hypertension: losartan, valsartan, irbesartan, candesartan, telmisartan, and eprosartan. These new drugs are highly selective for the AT1 receptor subtype and induce dose-dependent inhibition of the BP response to exogenous AngII. Numerous double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have demonstrated that ARB are efficacious for treating mild, moderate, and severe hypertension. When compared with other classes of antihypertensive agents, ARB are as effective as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium antagonists, thiazide diuretics, and beta-blockers. One advantage of ARB as a class is their excellent tolerability and side effect profile. Several large clinical trials of ARB are now under way to demonstrate their benefits in hypertension, heart failure, and type II diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "2": "Several imidazole derivatives that bind specifically to the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (the angiotensin receptor blockers, or ARB), have been developed in recent years and made available to clinicians. Preclinical studies revealed some differences in pharmacokinetic parameters and in vitro effects. However, most of the reported physiologic effects associated with ARB administration are similar to those of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI). In short-term clinical studies, the efficacy of ARB in reducing BP (BP) was similar to that of the ACEI, whereas (with a few exceptions) the side-effect profile was comparable to that of placebo. Whether targeting antihypertensive treatment with such a high specificity within the renin cascade carries major clinical advantages over inhibiting angiotensin-converting enzyme remains to be demonstrated.", 
    "3": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is one of the body's most powerful regulators of arterial pressure and body fluid volumes. Although the acute effects of angiotensin II (AngII), the primary active component of the RAS, on arterial pressure are mediated primarily by peripheral vasoconstriction, its chronic BP effects are closely intertwined with volume homeostasis, particularly with intrarenal actions that influence pressure natriuresis. AngII shifts pressure natriuresis toward higher BP primarily by increasing tubular reabsorption rather than decreasing GFR. In fact, activation of the RAS can serve as an important means of preventing decreases in GFR during volume depletion or circulatory depression. However, with prolonged excess AngII formation, particularly in association with hypertension or overperfusion of the kidney, AngII can contribute to glomerular injury and a gradual loss of nephron function through its hemodynamic actions. The multiple effects of AngII to increase tubular reabsorption provide a powerful mechanism to protect against volume depletion and low BP. However, when AngII levels are inappropriately elevated, this necessitates increased arterial pressure to maintain sodium and water balance. Blockade of the RAS has proved to be a powerful therapeutic tool for lowering BP and improving kidney function in disorders such as hypertension, congestive heart failure, and chronic renal disease.", 
    "4": "The beneficial effects of aspirin and ACE inhibitors in CHF have been well established; however, the clinical relevance of the drug interaction between these agents remains controversial. The exact mechanism of this interaction is not known, but the proposed theory involves the opposing effects of aspirin and ACE inhibitors on prostaglandins. The medical literature dose not provide a clear picture of the clinical significance of concomitant aspirin and ACE inhibitor therapy. Some studies suggest that the dose of aspirin may influence the clinical relevance of this interaction. Short-term use of aspirin > or = 300 mg was found to attenuate enalapril's effect on hemodynamic variables. However, short-term use of low-dose aspirin (236 mg) produced no effect on blood pressure. Patients with CHF who require therapy with both aspirin and ACE inhibitors may want to consider low doses of aspirin with active monitoring of hemodynamic parameters. However, chronic aspirin therapy in patients with CHF on concomitant ACE inhibitors has not been adequately studied at this time. Data concerning a possible interaction between angiotensin II receptor antagonists and aspirin are not available. However, because angiotensin II receptor antagonists do not interfere with kininase II activity, it would seem unlikely that aspirin would interact similarly with an angiotensin II receptor antagonist. Further studies are needed to examine the exact mechanism of the interaction between aspirin and ACE inhibitors. These studies should focus on the effects of different doses of aspirin given concomitantly with ACE inhibitors in patients with CHF. Prospective, randomized studies are also needed to determine the long-term effects of aspirin and ACE inhibitor therapy on mortality in patients with CHF.", 
    "5": "The human somatic angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) contains two homologous domains, each bearing a zinc-dependent active site. All of the synthetic inhibitors of this enzyme used in clinical applications interact with these two active sites to a similar extent. Recently, several lines of evidence have suggested that the N-terminal active site of ACE might be involved in specific hydrolysis of some important physiological substrates, like Acetyl-Seryl-Aspartyl-Lysyl-Proline, a negative regulator of hematopoietic stem cell differentiation and proliferation. These findings have stimulated studies aimed at identifying new ACE inhibitors able to block only one of the two active sites of this enzyme. By screening phosphinic peptide libraries, we discovered a phosphinic peptide Ac-Asp-(L)Phepsi(PO2-CH2)(L)Ala-Ala-NH2, called RXP 407, which is able to differentiate the two ACE active sites, with a dissociation constant three orders of magnitude lower for the N-domain of the enzyme. The usefulness of a combinatorial chemistry approach to develop new lead structures is underscored by the unusual chemical structure of RXP 407, as compared with classical ACE inhibitors. As a highly potent and selective inhibitor of the N-terminal active site of wild ACE (Ki = 12 nM), RXP 407, which is metabolically stable in vivo, may lead to a new generation of ACE inhibitors able to block in vivo only a subset of the different functions regulated by ACE.", 
    "6": "Angiooedema has been reported as a rare but in most cases serious adverse effect of ACE inhibitors. Recent reports have indicated that angiotensin II-receptor antagonists may also induce angiooedema. As part of the spontaneous reporting scheme in Switzerland the Swiss Drug Monitoring Centre (SANZ) has received reports on 94 cases of ACE inhibitor-induced and 4 cases of angiotension II-receptor antagonist-induced angiooedema. These 98 spontaneously reported cases were analysed in detail. 28 cases were classified as serious and in three patients intubation was even required. In 35% of cases angiooedema was induced within the first week of therapy and in 64% within the first year. In one case the angio-oedema displayed latency of 8 years. Latency of this duration shows that this adverse drug reaction (ADR) may be hard to detect. In 45 of the 98 cases the oedema persisted for more than one day (maximum 2 months), although in some instances the patients continued ACE-inhibitor therapy. In 25 cases the oedema recurred, in one instance as many as 20 times. In rare cases angiooedema may also be induced by angiotensin II-receptor antagonists, although in such instances the course of the oedema was usually milder. In two of the four reported cases angiooedema recurred after switching from an ACE inhibitor to an angiotensin II-receptor antagonists. The four reported cases from Switzerland showed a similar profile when compared with 25 internationally documented cases. Our data indicate that angiooedema is a specific ACE inhibitor ADR. A protracted latency period may be observed and recurrence of oedema is frequent. Angiotensin II-receptor antagonist-induced angiooedema may also occur in rare instances.", 
    "7": "The purpose of this review is to examine the potential contribution of arrhythmia to the occurrence of sudden death in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and to discuss current treatment options. We performed a search of the MEDLINE database from 1985 to the present and the reference citations of selected articles pertaining to the prognostic significance, management, and pathophysiology of arrhythmias in DCM. A large proportion of patients with DCM die suddenly, most secondary to ventricular arrhythmia and a smaller proportion due to bradyarrhythmia. The presence and severity of ventricular ectopy may predict risk for sudden death, but the role of electrophysiologic study and signal-averaged electrocardiography in further risk stratifying patients remains uncertain. Abnormalities of the autonomic nervous system and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis appear to promote the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors improve overall mortality in congestive heart failure, and the use of direct angiotensin-receptor antagonists is currently being studied. In addition, beta-receptor antagonists appear to improve morbidity and may prove to improve mortality in heart failure as well. Other interventions still under investigation include amiodarone and the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. The underlying pathophysiology of sudden death in DCM involves primarily ventricular tachyarrhythmia. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors remain a mainstay of improving overall mortality, while further study on the roles for newer drugs and devices is ongoing.", 
    "8": "Glucocorticoids increase renal blood flow (RBF) and glomerular filtration rate in many species, but the mechanisms involved are unclear. We investigated whether cortisol-induced renal vasodilatation in conscious sheep depends on interactions with prostaglandins or angiotensin II. Intravenous infusion of cortisol (5 mg/h) for 5 h increased renal conductance (RC) by 1.06 +/- 0.24 ml. min-1. mmHg-1 more than vehicle. During intrarenal infusion of indomethacin (0.25 mg. kg-1. h-1), the cortisol-induced increase in RC (0.28 +/- 0.21 ml. min-1. mmHg-1) was significantly reduced. The cortisol-induced rise in RBF (103 +/- 17 ml/min) was not significantly reduced by indomethacin treatment (76 +/- 9 ml/min). Combined intrarenal infusion of indomethacin (0.25 mg. kg-1. h-1) with Nomega-nitro-L-arginine (2.0 mg. kg-1. h-1), a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, abolished the cortisol-induced increases in both RC and RBF. Inhibition of angiotensin II synthesis with intravenous captopril (40 mg/h) blocked the renal vasoconstrictor action of angiotensin I but did not inhibit the cortisol-induced increases in RBF and RC. This study provides evidence that nitric oxide and prostaglandins play a role in cortisol-induced renal vasodilatation but indicates that this response is independent of an interaction with angiotensin.", 
    "9": "The kappa-opioid receptor exerts a negative modulatory action on the beta-adrenoceptor and the action is blunted in adult spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). In order to determine whether the blunted negative modulation of the beta-adrenoceptor by the kappa-opioid receptor contributes to the development of hypertension, the electrically induced intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) transient was measured in single ventricular myocytes of SHR at 4, 6, 8 and 13-week-old and the age-matched Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats. The electrically induced [Ca2+]i transients were augmented by norepinephrine (NE), a beta-adrenoceptor agonist, over four-fold in WKY rats of all ages studied and in SHR of 4 and 6 weeks of age. The enhancing effect of NE in 8- and 13-week-old SHR was, however, only approximately three-fold, significantly lower than the corresponding values in age-matched WKY rats. Similarly, the electrically induced [Ca2+]i transients were also augmented by forskolin, an activator of adenylate cyclase, by approximately two-fold in WKY rats of all ages and SHR aged 4 and 6 weeks. In SHR aged 8 and 13 weeks, the effect of forskolin was only 1.5-fold, significantly lower than the two-fold increase in the corresponding WKY rats. The enhancing effects of NE and forskolin were attenuated by U50,488H, a selective kappa-opioid agonist, by approximately 50 and 25%, respectively, in both types of rats of all ages studied, with the exception of 13-week-old rats. In rats of this age group, the attenuations by U50,488H on the enhancing effects of NE and forskolin were 17 and 9% in SHR, respectively, significantly less than the corresponding 54 and 29% in WKY. The fact that attenuation of U50,488H on the enhancing effects of NE and forskolin only occurs in 13-week-old SHR when hypertension has been fully developed indicates that the attenuated inhibitory modulation of kappa-opioid receptor stimulation does not contribute to the initiation of hypertension. Interestingly, the enhancing effects of NE and forskolin on the electrically induced [Ca2+]i transient was attenuated in SHR aged from 8 weeks when the blood pressure was rapidly increasing. The different time courses of altered responses to U50,488H, and NE and forskolin suggest that the attenuated negative modulation of kappa-receptor stimulation on the beta-adrenergic receptor is not due to the signal transduction pathway activated by beta-adrenergic stimulation. In 13-week-old SHR with the arterial blood pressure restored to normal by pharmacological manipulations, the blunted responses to NE, U50,488H and forskolin still occurred, indicating that the altered responses to activation of beta-adrenergic and kappa-opioid receptors and adenylate cyclase are not secondary to hypertension.", 
    "10": "A number of important questions surrounding the treatment of systolic congestive heart failure have been answered by randomised clinical trials completed within the past 2 years. In particular, these studies have established that high-dose angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition is more beneficial than low dose therapy, and that angiotensin II receptor antagonists are an acceptable alternative in patients unable to tolerate ACE inhibitors. Digoxin has been shown to be the only inotropic agent not associated with increased mortality, while amiodarone exerts a modest survival benefit in arrhythmiaprone patients. Beta-blockers appear to be beneficial for selected patients although their precise role remains to be defined by ongoing studies.", 
    "11": "Chymase is a chymotrypsin-type serine protease mainly localized in mast cells (MCs). Human, primate, and dog chymase generate angiotensin II (Ang II) from Ang I, while mouse and rat chymases degrade Ang II. It is suggested that chymase generating Ang II might be an alternative Ang II-forming enzyme to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in the renin-angiotensin system in tissues, but not in blood, and cause hypertrophy and remodeling of cardiovascular tissues. Chymase also degrades extracellular matrix, and processes procollagenase, inflammatory cytokines and other bioactive peptides. As a result, chymase plays important roles in inflammatory tissues through its proteolytic activities to cause tissue remodeling, that is, a chymase inhibitor may have the ability to prevent diseases caused by the above inflammatory reactions. The investigation of chymase inhibitors by pharmaceutical companies has yielded peptide and peptide mimetic inhibitors. We also found potent non-peptide low molecular inhibitors. However, the in vivo functions of chymase have not been verified so far by applying a chymase inhibitor to in vivo pathological models. In this article, we overview the pathophysiological roles of chymase and chymase inhibitors proposed to date, and discuss the structure-activity relationships of substituted 3-phenylsulfonyl-1-phenylimidazolidine-2,4-dione derivatives.", 
    "12": "The relationship between atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (ARAS) and blood pressure control remains poorly understood. Duplex ultrasonography is a noninvasive method for detecting and grading ARAS. The purpose of this study was to characterize the relationship between the degree of ARAS, levels of blood pressure, and control of blood pressure with antihypertensive medication. A cross-sectional analysis was performed on 139 patients with ARAS. All patients had at least one diseased renal artery by duplex ultrasound. Renal arteries were classified as normal, less than 60% stenosis, or 60% or greater (high-grade) stenosis. Data regarding blood pressure, coexisting risk factors, and medications were collected. The extent of ARAS was significantly associated with progressive elevation of the systolic blood pressure, whereas the diastolic component was elevated in the case of unilateral high-grade stenosis: no high-grade stenoses, 153 +/- 22/81 +/- 10 mm Hg; unilateral high-grade stenosis, 162 +/- 22/86 +/- 9 mm Hg; and bilateral high-grade stenoses, 174 +/- 27/82 +/- 9 mm Hg (P = 0.002 systolic; P = 0.02 diastolic). Eighty-two percent of the patients were taking known antihypertensive medications. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) usage versus nonusage was associated with a significantly lower systolic (157 +/- 27 v 169 +/- 22 mm Hg; P = 0.03) and diastolic (79 +/- 9 v 85 +/- 9 mm Hg; P = 0.001) blood pressure. The effect of ACEI usage was observed in patients with high-grade ARAS. None of the other classes of antihypertensive medications were associated with significantly lower blood pressure. In patients with ARAS, blood pressure levels were correlated with the severity of renal artery disease. Patients taking ACEIs had significantly lower blood pressures, and the effect of ACEI usage was strongest among patients with unilateral ARAS.", 
    "13": "Previous studies showed a renoprotective effect of l-arginine in experimental uremia. Whether this was caused by an increased nitric oxide (NO) release or depended on l-arginine per se is not clear. Here, we evaluated whether chronic administration of an NO donor, molsidomine, controlled systemic blood pressure and renal disease progression and prolonged survival in rats with renal mass reduction (RMR). Rats with RMR received the following daily in the drinking water: group 1 (n = 21), no specific therapy (vehicle); group 2 (n = 12), molsidomine, 120 mg/L; group 3 (n = 9), lisinopril, 25 mg/L; and group 4 (n = 12), reserpine, 5 mg/L, hydralazine, 80 mg/L, and hydrochlorothiazide, 25 mg/L, from day 21 after surgery, when rats had hypertension and proteinuria, until the death of the vehicle-treated rats. Molsidomine normalized systemic hypertension, only partially reduced proteinuria and serum creatinine levels, but significantly prolonged animal survival, particularly in the early stage of the disease. Lisinopril at a similar systemic blood pressure was even better than molsidomine in limiting proteinuria, preserving renal function, and prolonging survival, but triple therapy, despite being effective on blood pressure, offered no renoprotection or prolonged survival. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) levels, formed in excessive amounts by the kidneys of these animals, were reduced by molsidomine and lisinopril, but not by triple therapy. The prolongation of survival by NO donor could be attributed to its effect of reducing ET levels, which in turn may limit the smooth muscle cell proliferation and matrix accumulation responsible for organ and, especially, myocardial fibrosis in uremia.", 
    "14": "The tetrapeptide Acetyl-N-Ser-Asp-Lys-Pro (AcSDKP), an inhibitor of hematopoietic stem cell proliferation, is known to reduce in vivo the damage resulting from treatment with chemotherapeutic agents or ionizing radiation on the stem cell compartment. Recently, AcSDKP has been shown to be a physiological substrate of the N-active site of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE). Four analogs of the tetrapeptide expressing a high stability towards ACE degradation in vitro have been synthesized in order to provide new molecules likely to improve the myeloprotection displayed by AcSDKP. These analogs are three pseudopeptides with a modified peptidic bond, Ac-Serpsi(CH2-NH)Asp-Lys-Pro, Ac-Ser-Asppsi(CH2-NH)Lys-Pro, Ac-Ser-Asp-Lyspsi(CH2-N)Pro, and one C-terminus modified peptide (AcSDKP-NH2). We report here that these analogs reduce in vitro the proportion of murine colony-forming units-granulocyte/macrophage in S-phase and inhibit the entry into cycle of high proliferative potential colony-forming cells. The efficacy of AcSDKP analogs in preventing in vitro primitive hematopoietic stem cells from entering into cycle suggests that these molecules could be new candidates for the powerful inhibition of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell proliferation in vivo.", 
    "15": "Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in congestive heart failure (CHF) improves cardiac and peripheral hemodynamic function and exercise performance. However, studies on the effects of long-term treatment with an ACE inhibitor on the neurogenic and nonneurogenic regulation and structural microangiopathy of the peripheral microvasculature in CHF are lacking.", 
    "16": "We investigated the effect of 12 weeks of treatment with the ACE inhibitor fosinopril on peripheral microvascular function in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 12 patients treated with fosinopril and 10 patients treated with placebo. All had moderate CHF. Microvascular blood flow and resistance were calculated after application of the local isotope washout method in relaxed and nonrelaxed calf vascular beds in the supine position and during head-up tilt. Skeletal muscle vascular resistance was reduced in the fosinopril group (46 +/- 6 to 30 +/- 1 mm Hg.mL-1.100 g.min +/- standard error; P < .05) and differed compared with the effect of placebo (P < .05) where no change was seen (37 +/- 11 to 55 +/- 13 mm Hg.mL-1.100 g.min; not significant [NS]). Also, skin minimal vascular resistance was reduced during fosinopril treatment (13 +/- 0.6 to 11 +/- 0.7 mm Hg.mL-1.100 g.min; P < .05) and differed compared with the effect of placebo (P < .05) with absence of change (12 +/- 1.6 to 14 +/- 1.4 mm Hg.mL-1.100 g.min; NS).",

    "19": "We conducted a cross-sectional study linking prescribing data with hospital admission data from 215 primary health care practices in Greater Glasgow, United Kingdom. We obtained numbers of prescriptions of diuretics. ACE inhibitors, and digoxin and numbers of admissions for heart failure. The mean practice rate of diuretic prescription was 0.7 per patient per year, the mean practice rate of ACE inhibitor prescription was 0.06 per patient per year, the mean practice rate of digoxin prescription was 0.09 per patient per year, and the mean practice rate of admission for heart failure was 3.29 per 1,000 patients per year. There was a strong and significant association between the rate of diuretic prescription and the rate of digoxin prescription. There was only a moderate inverse association between the ratio of ACE inhibitor to diuretic prescriptions and the rate of admissions for heart failure.", 
    "20": "ACE inhibitors are underused. Rates of diuretic and digoxin prescriptions correlate strongly and are presumably both markers for similar cardiovascular morbidity. There was no evidence that ACE inhibitors modulated the rate of heart failure admissions.", 
    "21": "We have previously shown that in rat renal cortex, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression is localized to cTALH cells in the region of the macula densa, and that dietary salt restriction increases COX-2 expression. Administration of the angiotensin converting inhibitor, captopril, further increased COX-2 mRNA and renal cortical COX-2 immunoreactivity, with the most pronounced expression in the macula densa. Administration of an AT1 receptor antagonist, losartan, also significantly increased cortical COX-2 mRNA expression and COX-2 immunoreactivity. Mutant mice homozygous for both Agtr1a and Agtr1b null mutations (Agtr1a-/-,Agtr1b-/-) demonstrated large increases in immunoreactive COX-2 expression inthe cTALH/macula densa. To determine whether increased COX-2expression in response to ACE inhibition mediated increases in renin production, rats were treated with captopril for one week with or without the specific COX-2 inhibitor, SC58236. Plasma renin activity increased significantly in the captropril group, and this increase was significantly inhibited by simultaneous treatment with SC58236. Thus, these studies indicated that angiotensin II inhibitors augment upregulation of renal cortical COX-2 in states of volume depletion, suggesting that negative feedback by the renin-angiotensin system modulates renal cortical COX-2 expression and that COX-2 is a mediator of increased renin production in response to inhibition of angiotension II production.", 
    "22": "Series of substrates derivatives of peptide deformylase were systematically synthesized and studied for their capacities to undergo hydrolysis. Data analysis indicated the requirement for a hydrophobic first side chain and for at least two main chain carbonyl groups in the substrate. For instance, Fo-Met-OCH3 and Fo-Nle-OCH3 were the minimal substrates of peptide deformylase obtained in this study, while positively charged Fo-Nle-ArgNH2 was the most efficient substrate (kcat/Km = 4.5 x 10(5) M-1.s-1). On the basis of this knowledge, 3-mercapto-2-benzylpropanoylglycine (thiorphan), a known inhibitor of thermolysin, could be predicted and further shown to inhibit the deformylation reaction. The inhibition by this compound was competitive and proved to depend on the hydrophobicity at the P1' position. Spectroscopic evidence that the sulfur group of thiorphan binds next to the active site metal ion on the enzyme could be obtained. Consequently, a small thiopseudopeptide derived from Fo-Nle-OCH3 was designed and synthesized. This compound behaved as a competitive inhibitor of peptide deformylase with KI = 52 +/- 5 microM. Introduction of a positive charge to this thiopeptide via addition of an arginine at P2' improved the inhibition constant up to 2.5 +/- 0.5 microM, a value 4 orders of magnitude smaller than that of the starting inhibitors. Evidence that this inhibitor, imino[(5-methoxy-5-oxo-4-[[2-(sulfanylmethyl)hexanoyl]amino]pentyl )am ino]methanamine, binds inside the active site cavity of peptide deformylase, while keeping intact the 3D fold of the protein, was provided by NMR. A fingerprint of the interaction of the inhibitor with the residues of the enzyme was obtained.",

Serial hemodynamic measurements were made over 24 h following randomization to irbesartan 12.5 mg, 37.5 mg, 75 mg, 150 mg or placebo.

The neurohormonal effects of irbesartan were highly variable and none of the changes was statistically significant. There was a significant dose-related decrease in the percentage of patients discontinuing study medication because of worsening heart failure. Irbesartan was well tolerated without evidence of dose-related cough or azotemia.",

    "28": "One possible intervention to interrupt the deleterious effects of the renin-angiotensin system is suppression of angiotensin II (Ang II) formation by inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). However, ACE inhibition incompletely suppresses Ang II formation and also leads to accumulation of bradykinin. Angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptors are believed to promote the known deleterious effects of Ang II. Therefore, AT1 receptor antagonists have been recently introduced into therapy for hypertension and congestive heart failure (CHF). Although there are significant differences between the effects of AT1 receptor antagonists and ACE inhibitors including the unopposed stimulation of angiotensin II type 2 (AT2) receptors by AT1 receptor antagonists, the discussion of whether ACE inhibitors, AT1 receptor antagonists or the combination of both are superior in the pharmacotherapy of CHF is still largely theoretical. Accordingly, AT1 receptor antagonists are still investigational. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors remain first line therapy in patients with CHF due to systolic dysfunction. However, in patients not able to tolerate ACE inhibitor induced side effects, in particular cough, AT1 receptor antagonism is a good alternative. In clinical practice, emphasis should be placed on increasing the utilization of ACE inhibitors, as more than 50% of patients with CHF do not receive ACE inhibitors. In addition, the majority of those on ACE inhibitors receive doses lower than the dosage used in the large clinical trials. Although not yet completely proved, it is likely that high doses of ACE inhibition are superior to low doses with respect to prognosis and symptoms.", 
    "29": "The effects on plasma angiotensin-converting enzyme activity and renin activity of the two long-acting angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, lisinopril and enalapril, alone and in combination with propranolol were studied. In an open, randomised, cross-over design 12 healthy volunteers received orally enalapril 20 mg alone, enalapril 20 mg in combination with propranolol 80 mg, lisinopril 20 mg alone, and lisinopril 20 mg in combination with propranolol 80 mg. Plasma angiotensin-converting enzyme activity and plasma renin activity were measured for 24 h after each treatment period. Lisinopril and enalapril reduced plasma angiotensin converting enzyme activity substantially and equally at six hr (-70%, P<0.05) and 12 hr (-65%, P<0.05), irrespective of combination with propranolol. At 24 hr plasma angiotensin-converting enzyme activity remained significantly suppressed only after lisinopril (-60%, P<0.05). Plasma renin activity increased almost ten times after ingestion of both angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, but the effect lasted significantly longer after lisinopril than after enalapril. Beta-Adrenergic blockade blunted the effect on the increase in plasma renin activity induced by both angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Our results show that the effect of lisinopril on plasma angiotensin-converting enzyme activity and plasma renin activity lasted longer than that of enalapril. beta-Adrenergic blockade suppressed the effect on elevated plasma renin activity, but did not influence the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors on plasma angiotensin-converting enzyme activity.", 
    "30": "We studied the effects of 10-week long enalapril and losartan treatments (4 and 15 mg kg(-1) day(-1), respectively) on mesenteric arterial function in vitro in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). The relaxations of noradrenaline-precontracted rings to acetylcholine, nitroprusside and cromakalim were similar in WKY and enalapril- and losartan-treated SHR, and more pronounced than in untreated SHR. The responses to acetylcholine were attenuated by N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester in WKY and drug-treated SHR, but were completely inhibited in untreated SHR. When hyperpolarization of smooth muscle was prevented by KCl-induced precontractions, no differences were found in the relaxations to acetylcholine and nitroprusside between the groups, and the dilatations to cromakalim were abolished. Moreover, in noradrenaline-precontracted rings of drug-treated SHR, the addition of tetraethylammonium attenuated the nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-resistant relaxations to acetylcholine and abolished the enhanced dilatations to nitroprusside. In conclusion, since the enhancement of vasorelaxation in enalapril- and losartan-treated SHR was abolished by conditions preventing hyperpolarization, the improved vasodilatation following these therapies could be attributed to enhanced vasodilatation via K+ channels in this model of hypertension.",

In such cases, combined treatment or drug substitution are recommended (sequential or substitutive monotherapy). In the last years, the fixed dose combinations in one single pharmaceutical preparation have proliferated. These associations must fulfill a number of conditions in order to be considered rational, as for instance the compatibility of its pharmacokinetic features, properly dosing, the absence of new secondary effects and the high efficiency showed in most of patients. The advantages of these combinations are the comfort and easiness of the therapeutic schema, antihypertensive action strengthening, less secondary effects when dose is reduced, and perhaps a synergism in the protection of target organs. The most popular combinations are: potassium sparing diuretic plus thiazide, diuretic plus beta block, diuretic plus ACEI, or calcium antagonist plus ACEI.", 
    "32": "Nebivolol was compared in a dose of 5 mg once daily with enalapril 10 mg once daily over 7 months in a double-blind randomised trial in essential hypertension. The two drugs had very similar sustained effects in lowering both systolic and diastolic pressures; neither had an orthostatic component. Both drugs were well-tolerated. No haematological, biochemical, or urinary abnormalities were seen.", 
    "33": "Compelling evidence from clinical trials confirms the benefits of secondary prevention for patients with known coronary disease. Preventive therapies initiated after myocardial infarction can extend overall survival, reduce subsequent myocardial infarction, decrease the need for revascularization, and improve quality of life. All patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease should be considered for lipid lowering therapy, antiplatelet agents, beta-blockers, and control of hypertension. Long-term therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors should be continued in patients with systolic dysfunction. Hormone replacement therapy has not been shown to benefit postmenopausal women when initiated after myocardial infarction. Smoking cessation, weight control, exercise, and appropriate diet represent important behavioral modifications.", 
    "34": "The study aimed to describe the treatment status of hypertensive patients and the prescribing patterns of private medical practitioners treating medical aid scheme patients with hypertension.", 
    "35": "Data on hypertensive patients belonging to medical aid schemes were provided to the drug utilisation review consultancy, Quality Health Services (QHS), by private medical practitioners. The data were computerised and included the age and gender of the patient, the diastolic and systolic blood pressure (BP), the medication prescribed for the condition and the qualifications of the reporting doctor. All the prescribed drugs were categorised into 12 drug classes and combination preparations had each constituent categorised. The level of BP allowed the degree of BP control to be described as controlled (< 140/90 mmHg), borderline (140/90-< 160/95 mmHg) and uncontrolled (> or = 160/95 mmHg).", 
    "36": "Included in the study were 11,696 hypertensive patients (46.3% male and 53.7% female) and the 3,503 doctors who cared for them. The systolic BP showed an age-related increase, but the diastolic BP did not. The level of BP control was high, with less than a quarter of patients having uncontrolled hypertension. The most frequently prescribed drug class was angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (32.2%). Beta-blockers accounted for 20.8% and calcium antagonists for 14% of all prescriptions. Thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics on their own accounted for only 7.8% of prescriptions. However, a further 13.8% of prescriptions contained this class of diuretics in combination with other drug classes. Diuretics of all classes taken on their own or in combination were used by 33.9% of patients.", 
    "37": "Good levels of hypertension control were reported for hypertensive patients by their private practitioners. Almost half of all prescriptions were for the newer and more costly antihypertensive drugs (ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists), although their effectiveness in reducing long-term complications of hypertension is still unproven. Furthermore, these prescribing patterns do not conform to those recommended by the Southern African Hypertension Society's hypertension management guidelines.", 
    "38": "We studied the interaction of the central renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and vasopressin system in rats with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) due to aortic banding. In these animals plasma vasopressin is elevated and vasopressin content is increased in specific brain areas. Chronic blockade of the RAS by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition (ramipril) and AT1 receptor antagonism (losartan) significantly attenuated circulating and central vasopressin in rats with LVH. Given the antidiuretic, vasoconstrictive, and growth-promoting effects, vasopressin may participate in the cardiovascular alterations in LVH. Blockade of the RAS strongly ameliorates central and peripheral-vasopressin. Therefore, central modulatory effects on vasopressin might contribute to the therapeutic efficacy of ACE inhibitors and AT1 antagonists.", 
    "39": "This study compares the effects of a calcium channel blocker (amlodipine) and an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril) on in vivo insulin sensitivity in patients with essential hypertension. Forty-six patients with mild and moderate hypertension were studied. After a 2-week single-blind placebo phase, they were randomly assigned to double-blind therapy with either amlodipine (2.5 to 10 mg/day) or enalapril (5 to 40 mg/day) for 16 weeks. Both groups were comparable in terms of demographic characteristics, degree of obesity, metabolic parameters, and arterial blood pressure. Insulin sensitivity was measured at baseline and at week 16 during the active phase using euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamps. Arterial blood pressure decreased similarly in both groups. Whole body glucose uptake (M-value) increased with amlodipine from 3.63 +/- 0.32 (mean +/- SEM) to 3.97 +/- 0.31 mg/kg/min (P = .02). A similar tendency was observed with enalapril: from 3.59 +/- 0.32 to 3.94 +/- 0.30 mg/kg/min (P = .09). A trend to lower steady-state insulin level during the second clamp (compared to baseline) was observed in both groups. The clamp-derived insulin sensitivity index (that corrects for steady-state insulin levels and glucose levels during the clamp) increased similarly in both groups: from 1.15 +/- 0.11 to 1.39 +/- 0.13 with amlodipine (P = .03) and from 1.25 +/- 0.13 to 1.49 +/- 0.16 with enalapril (P = .01). LDL cholesterol decreased with amlodipine (mean change, -11.3 mg/dL, P = .004). Amlodipine and enalapril were associated with increments in insulin sensitivity. Amlodipine provided an additional benefit with decreased low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels.", 
    "40": "Nasal allergy is the most common type I allergic disease. During allergic reaction, chemical mediators may be released from residual cell, and thus, attract additional inflammatory cells. One mediator implicated in this response is bradykinin (BK), a potent proinflammatory nonapeptide. This study was designed to investigate the effects of BK on nasal mucosa, and to determine the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in BK-induced nasal responses. BK nasal provocation (100 micrograms) was studied in 7 normal volunteers and 7 patients with perennial allergic rhinitis. After provoking of BK response, nasal secretions and saline lavage fluids were collected for analysis of total protein (a protein secretion marker), albumin (a vascular permeability marker), and lysozyme (a serous cell marker). In addition, after administering of Captopril 50 mg, a specific ACE inhibitor, the same protocol was performed. In both groups, BK induced plasma exudation and serous gland secretion. Premedication with captopril did not alter BK-induced responses in normal individuals. In allergic patients, captopril enhanced BK-induced vascular permeability, but not glandular secretion. These results indicate that allergic subjects have nasal hyperresponsiveness to BK, and that ACE predominantly modulates the vascular permeability of allergic nasal mucosa. It seems likely that BK may contribute to the expression of nasal allergic symptoms, and that inhibition of ACE may lead to increased nasal responsiveness.",

Systolic blood pressure changed from 147.4+/-3.2 mmHg at baseline to 152.7+/-4.4 mmHg at the final visit in control patients and changed from 157.6+/-5.1 mmHg to 149.1+/-6.1 mmHg in patients treated with fosinopril (P=0.02). Fosinopril reduced diastolic pressure by 6.3 (95%CI 0.3-12.4) mmHg and systolic pressure by 13.3 (95%CI 2.7-23.8) mmHg compared with placebo. The left ventricular mass index changed from 110.0+/-8.3 gm(-2) to 113.1+/-8.7 g m(-2) in the control patients and changed from 120.8+/-5.8 g m(-2) to 109.0+/-7.5 g m(-2) in patients treated with fosinopril (P=0.02). Fosinopril reduced left ventricular mass index by 14.9 (95%CI 2.2-27.6) g m(-2) compared with placebo.

    "45": "In a cohort of 67 patients from the Acute Infarction Ramipril Efficacy study, we showed that ramipril therapy was associated with a significant reduction in QT dispersion over a 2-month period after acute myocardial infarction. This reduction of ventricular repolarization inhomogeneity indicates an antiarrhythmic effect and may be an important additional mechanism for the reduced all-cause mortality and sudden death incidence achieved with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition after acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "46": "In this study, we examine the cost effectiveness of carvedilol for the treatment of chronic heart failure (CHF). We use a Markov model to project life expectancy and lifetime medical care costs for a hypothetical cohort of patients with CHF who were assumed alternatively to receive carvedilol plus conventional therapy (digoxin, diuretics, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) or conventional therapy alone. Patients on carvedilol were assumed to experience a reduced risk of death and hospitalization for CHF, which is consistent with findings from the US Carvedilol Heart Failure Trials Program. The benefits of carvedilol were projected under 2 alternative scenarios. In the first (\"limited benefits\"), benefits were conservatively assumed to persist for 6 months, the average duration of follow-up in these clinical trials, and then end abruptly. In the other (\"extended benefits\"), they were arbitrarily assumed to persist for 6 months and then decline gradually over time, vanishing by the end of 3 years. We estimated our model using data from the US Carvedilol Heart Failure Trials Program and other sources. For patients receiving conventional therapy alone, estimated life expectancy was 6.67 years; corresponding figures for those also receiving carvedilol were 6.98 and 7.62 years under the limited and extended benefits scenarios, respectively. Expected lifetime costs of CHF-related care were estimated to be $28,756 for conventional therapy, and $36,420 and $38,867 for carvedilol (limited and extended benefits, respectively). Cost per life-year saved for carvedilol was $29,477 and $12,799 under limited and extended benefits assumptions, respectively. The cost effectiveness of carvedilol for CHF compares favorably to that of other generally accepted medical interventions, even under conservative assumptions regarding the duration of therapeutic benefit.", 
    "47": "Earlier studies have shown that cardiovascular autonomic regulation is impaired in untreated or poorly controlled systemic hypertension. The purpose of this double-blind, randomized parallel trial was to evaluate whether improved blood pressure (BP) control can reverse this impairment. The study group consisted of 33 patients (age 45 to 63 years) with poor BP control who received randomized metoprolol or enalapril monotherapy. Baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) was assessed by phenylephrine test and time- and frequency-domain measurements of heart rate variability (HRV) were analyzed from 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic recordings during monotherapy and after 10 weeks of combination therapy with metoprolol + felodipine or enalaril + hydrochlorothiazide to lower casual BP to < 140/90 mm Hg. Intensified treatment decreased 24-hour systolic and diastolic BP from 139 +/- 12/86 +/- 8 mm Hg to 126 +/- 8/80 +/- 7 mm Hg (p <0.0001). BRS improved from 6.2 +/- 3.2 ms/mm Hg to 8.9 +/- 4.1 ms/mm Hg (p <0.0001) and measurements of HRV (e.g., SD of all RR intervals from 128 +/- 45 ms to 145 +/- 46 ms, p <0.001) improved significantly during the combination therapy. Changes in BRS and HRV were similar in magnitude in both treatment arms. Mean RR intervals were comparable before and after intensive antihypertensive therapy (850 +/- 124 ms vs 937 +/- 279 ms, p = NS). These data indicate that adequate BP control with modem antihypertensive combination therapy can improve cardiovascular autonomic function, which may partially explain the reduced cardiac mortality observed in patients with intensified antihypertensive therapy.", 
    "48": "The present work examined the effects of the subtype 2 of angiotensin II (AT2) receptors on the pressure-natriuresis using a new peptide agonist, and the possible involvement of cyclic guanosine 3', 5' monophosphate (cyclic GMP) in these effects. In adult anaesthetized rats (Inactin, 100 mg kg(-1), i.p.) deprived of endogenous angiotensin II by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition (quinapril, 10 mg kg(-1), i.v.), T2-(Ang II 4-8)2 (TA), a highly specific AT2 receptor agonist (5, 10 and 30 microg kg(-1) min(-1), i.v.) or its solvent was infused in four groups. Renal functions were studied at renal perfusion pressures (RPP) of 90, 110 and 130 mmHg and urinary cyclic GMP excretion when RPP was at 130 mmHg. The effects of TA (10 microg kg(-1) min(-1)) were reassessed in animals pretreated with PD 123319 (PD, 50 microg kg(-1) min(-1), i.v.), an AT2 receptor antagonist and the action of the same dose of PD alone was also determined. Increases in RPP from 90 to 130 mmHg did not change renal blood flow (RBF) but induced 8 and 15 fold increases in urinary flow and sodium excretion respectively. The 5 microg kg(-1) min(-1) dose of TA was devoid of action. The 10 and 30 microg kg(-1) min(-1) doses did not alter total RBF and glomerular filtration rate, but blunted pressure-diuresis and natriuresis relationships. These effects were abolished by PD. TA decreased urinary cyclic GMP excretion. After pretreatment with PD, this decrease was reversed to an increase which was also observed in animals receiving PD alone. In conclusion, renal AT2 receptors oppose the sodium and water excretion induced by acute increases in blood pressure and this action cannot be directly explained by changes in cyclic GMP.", 
    "49": "The effect of prolonged administration of a carboxypeptidase Y-like kininase inhibitor, ebelactone B (EB) (2-ethyl-3, 11-dihydroxy-4, 6, 8, 10, 12-pentamethyl-9-oxo-6-tetradecenoic 1, 3-lactone), on the development of deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertension was tested. The systolic blood pressure (SBP) of non-treated 6-week-old Sprague-Dawley strain rats was gradually increased by DOCA-salt treatment from 137+/-2 mmHg (n=11) to 195+/-7 mmHg at 10 weeks of age. With daily oral administration of lisinopril (5 mg kg(-1), twice a day), which is an inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme, a major kininase in plasma, the development of hypertension was not suppressed. By contrast, administration of EB (5 mg kg(-1), twice a day), completely inhibited the development of hypertension (SBP: 146+/-1 mmHg, n=5, 10 weeks old). The reduced SBP at 10 weeks of age was equal to the SBP before any treatment (142+/-1 mmHg, n=5). Direct determination of mean blood pressure (MBP) in conscious, unrestrained rats confirmed that MBP elevation was completely inhibited by EB. Continuous subcutaneous infusion (5 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) of HOE140, a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist, restored the elevation of SBP, which was suppressed by EB. The weights of left ventricle of DOCA-salt treated rats 10-weeks-old (0.36+/-0.02 g 100 g body weight(-1), n=11) was significantly reduced by EB (0.27+/-0.01, n=5), as were the sodium levels in serum, cerebrospinal fluid and erythrocyte. These findings suggested that EB is effective in preventing salt-related hypertension presumably by eliminating sodium retention.", 
    "50": "The work has been done on primary heart culture from neonatal rat ventricle. Cardiomyocyte hypertrophy was modelled using noradrenaline (NA), angiotensin II (AII) and fetal serum, respectively. Cell hypertrophy of primary heart cultures was assessed by measuring the surface area, the scope of protein synthesis estimated by 3H-leucine autoradiography and the contents of nucleic acids in gallocyanin-chromalum stained cardiomyocytes. The structure of myofibrillar apparatus was studied by rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin and indirect immunofluorescence of muscle alpha-actinin. Treatment with 10(-6) M NA increased 3H-leucine incorporation in 9-day old heart culture by 42% without changing cell size. AII in a dose 1 microM stimulated protein synthesis activity by 1.3 fold and the surface area by 1.7 fold, both in 2- and 9-day old primary heart cultures. The maximum stimulation of cell hypertrophy was provided by the medium supplemented with fetal serum. RNA contents in the cytoplasm of cardiomyocytes increased by 7.8 fold and the myocardial cell size by 2.9 fold in serum-supplemented culture by 9 days of cultivation. In the medium with fetal serum, amounts of cardiomyocytes with tetraploid nuclei reached 33%, against 14% in control. Coculturing of myocardiocytes and fibroblasts rendered effects of fetal serum on the growth of myocardiocytes. Cultivation in the presence of 1 microM enalapril, an ACE inhibitor, suppressed the development of cardiac muscle cells hypertrophy. The effect of enalapril depended on the degree of cellular hypertrophy. Addition of 10 microM amiloride to the medium lowered the protein synthesis by 29% independently on the initial cellular hypertrophy.", 
    "51": "Angiotensin II (ATII) has been suggested to contribute to shock-induced dysfunction of the gastric circulation.", 
    "52": "To substantiate this conjecture, the effects on gastric mucosal haemodynamics and the hyperaemic response to acid back-diffusion of ATII and the angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonist, telmisartan, were examined in normal rats and in animals subjected to haemorrhage.", 
    "53": "Gastric mucosal blood flow in phenobarbital-anaesthetized rats was recorded with the hydrogen clearance technique, and acid back-diffusion was induced by perfusing the stomach with ethanol (25%) in HCl (0.05 M).", 
    "54": "Intravenous infusion of ATII (0.3-10 nmol/min/kg) led to dose-dependent hypertension and a reduction of blood flow and vascular conductance in the gastric mucosa. The gastric hyperaemia caused by acid back-diffusion was attenuated by ATII (1 nmol/min/kg). These effects of ATII were antagonized by intravenous injection of telmisartan (1-10 mg/kg) which per se caused hypotension and dilated the gastric mucosal vasculature, but did not modify the gastric mucosal hyperaemia evoked by acid back-diffusion. Hypotension induced by haemorrhage (1.3 mL blood per 100 g body weight) failed to alter the hyperaemia due to acid back-diffusion, but caused gastric mucosal vasoconstriction, an effect that was left unaffected by telmisartan.", 
    "55": "ATII constricts the rat gastric microvasculature via an action involving AT1 receptors. The effects of telmisartan indicate that endogenous ATII contributes to the homeostatic regulation of gastric vascular tone but does not compromise the ability of the gastric microvasculature to react to influxing acid. These results negate the concept that ATII contributes to the gastric vascular perturbances in haemorrhagic shock.", 
    "56": "The effects of captopril and bradykinin on chorda tympani-induced salivation were studied in the submandibular gland of anesthetized cat. Captopril and bradykinin, but not des-Arg9-bradykinin, increased salivation evoked by electrical stimulation of chorda tympani. These potentiated effects of captopril and bradykinin were suppressed by Hoe-140, a kinin B2 receptor antagonist, or by concomitant addition of N(G)-nitro arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, and aspirin, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor. It appears that captopril potentiates chorda tympani-induced salivation through endogenously accumulated bradykinin, which acts on kinin B2 receptors, mediating production of nitric oxide and cyclooxygenase products.", 
    "57": "In the study usefulness of active renin (AR) measurement instead of plasma renin activity (PRA) in the diagnosis of reno-vascular hypertension(RVH) was evaluated. 42 patients with arterial hypertension (17F, 25M; mean age 45 + 12 years) and suspicion on RVH on the ground of the abnormal result of the preliminary renal angioscintigraphy were qualified to the study. Angioscintigraphic (SCT) and simultaneously renin captopril test (RCT) followed by renal arteriography or Doppler ultrasonography of renal arteries were performed in every case Haemodynamic significant stenosis of renal artery was revealed in 5 cases. The results of the examination in this group were as follows: in 3 patients positive RCT with PRA, in 4 patients positive RCT with R and in 2 patients positive SCT were found. The false positive results of RCT using PRA were obtained in 5 patients and only in 2 patients if using AR. There were no false positive results of SCT. The introduction of AR instead of PRA in RCT resulted in simplification and shortening of the diagnostic procedure. Furthermore, this modification increased detection of hemodynamically significant stenosis of renal artery from 2 cases revealed with SCT and 3 cases with PRAin RCT to 4 cases with AR. The successful preliminary results let us to introduce this modification of RCT to routine out-patients screening for RVH.", 
    "58": "Differences in the occurrence of renovascular hypertension (RVH) in the population of patients with arterial hypertension related to different preselection criteria induced us to analyse practical usefulness of clinical anamnesis for RVH. In 130 patients with arterial hypertension (72 women, 58 men, average age 48 years) and clinical suspicion on RVH, the initial renal angioscintigraphy (with 99m Tc-DTPA) was abnormal, demonstrating impairment of glomerular filtration rate. In the whole group captopril angioscintigraphy test (CAT) as well as captopril renin test (CRT) were simultaneously performed according to own protocol. In 24 cases highly suspected for RVH on the ground of clinical anamnesis the critical stenosis of renal artery (> 75% of the lumen) was found in the arteriography. The most significant signs of RVH in clinical anamnesis were the following: the diastolic blood pressure > 120 mm Hg (92% cases), resistance to 3 hypertensive drugs (92%), sudden onset and rapidly progressive course of hypertension (88%) and advanced hypertension retinopathy (79%). On the ground of these results, detailed clinical anamnesis is recommended as a cheap and easy preselection test for RVH in the hypertensive population.", 
    "59": "In 370 patients (pts) with hypertension(HT) in years 1986-1998 (168F + 202M, mean age 46 yrs) screening value of the following tests was evaluated: standard initial angioscintigraphy DTPA 99mTc(SA) in all pts(1-st screening group), significance of clinical suspicion on renovascular hypertension (RVHT) in the group of 74 pts (II-nd screening group). Captopril tests: renin captopril test(RCT) and isotopic captopril test (ICT) were performed in all 370 pts. Classical renal angiography as a reference test for renal artery stenosis (RAS) was performed in all pts suspected for RVHT on the basis of clinical anamnesis and or positive results of captopril tests. Results were as follows. Initial SA being abnormal in the whole group, appeared to be more significant for RAS only in the case of profound one side renal ischemia (GFR lower than 30% of total GFR). Resistance to three antihypertensive drugs, diastolic blood pressure > 120 mmHg and sudden onset of Ht, found in all 74 pts from the II-nd group, were the most significant clinical symptoms of RVHT, because critical RAS was found in 41, that is 55% of pts from the II-nd group. At least one positive CT was found in 37 from 42 pts with critical RAS in angiography with RTC being more sensitive and ICT more specific for hemodynamically significant RAS. The following screening protocol for RVHT was presented and discussed: precise clinical anamnesis followed by angiography or captopril tests according to the severity of clinical symptoms, aim of the study as well as accessibility and laboratory reproducibility of the captopril tests.", 
    "60": "Calcium-channel blockers differ in their molecular structure, their sites and modes of action. Based on rapport's about short acting calcium-channel blockers, several recent publications have questioned the safety of agents in this class, particularly nifedypine. It has been well documented that nifedypine can cause a precipitation uncontrollable drop in arterial blood pressure, which can be dangerous in the presence of ischemic heart disease, hypertension and other hemodynamically unstable situation. The cardiovascular risk for patients prescribed short-acting calcium channel blockers was eight times than for those taking, long-acting ones. Sustained-release preparations are the preferred form of therapy, as they appear, to be safer than short-acting agents. Most calcium-channel blockers, including verapamil, diltiazem, amlodypine, felodipine, nitrendipine and nicardipine have been shown to be effective in reducing symptoms of myocardial ischemia, and all have been used successfully for lowering blood pressure in hypertensive patients. Data from trials of nondihydropyridines have not demonstrated increased mortality or myocardial infarction rates in patients with myocardial ischemia and good left ventricular function. In patients with coronary artery disease and in hypertensive patients with poor left ventricular function, amlodypine or felodipine may be relatively safe alternative. Particular attention should be paid to the benefits of werapamil in postinfarct patients. In patients with hypertension, calcium-channel blockers should be reserved for use when diuretics, beta-blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been used already or contraindicated or are not tolerated and when further blood pressure reduction is necessary.",

This is a life threatening complication which, though rare, is becoming increasingly frequent with increased use of such drugs.", 
    "62": "In the present study we investigated the effect of a single dose, and 3 months of treatment with spirapril on kidney function, renin-angiotensin system, renal handling of sodium and blood pressure, in patients with reduced kidney function (serum creatinine 1.5-3 mg%) and hypertension. A single dose of 6 mg spirapril given at the beginning of the study did not affect glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal plasma flow (RPF), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity, plasma renin activity (PRA) or renal handling of sodium. When the single dose of spirapril was given after 3 months of treatment with this agent, renal hemodynamics and PRA did not change. ACE activity, which was depressed by the previous spirapril treatment, decreased further (from 9.5 +/- 3.1 to 1.4 +/- 1.0 nmol/ml/min), (p < 0.05). Administration of 6 mg spirapril o.d. for 3 months did not have any effect on GFR or RPF. Serum ACE activity decreased from 92.1 +/- 8.0 to 5.1 +/- 2.6 nmol/ml/min (p < 0.05) and PRA increased from 1.4 +/- 1.2 to 4.1 +/- 3.6 ng/ml/min (p < 0.05). Plasma aldosterone did not change. Similar results were obtained when spirapril was combined with 5 mg isradipine in the initial and final single dose, or in the 3 months' treatment (5 mg o.d.). Blood pressure was normalized in 38% of the patients who received spirapril and in 71% of the patients who received spirapril and isradipine. Thus, (a) treatment with spirapril in patients with mild to moderate chronic renal insufficiency was not associated with deleterious effects on kidney function; (b) spirapril in a dose of 6 mg alone or in combination with 5 mg isradipine is effective in reducing blood pressure in hypertensive patients with reduced kidney function.",

Trough: peak ratios were calculated by two different methods (global and individualized approaches) from 24 h ambulatory blood pressure recordings made after the placebo period and after the active treatment period. Residual lowering of blood pressure after single-blind, single-dose omission was also investigated with further 24 h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Safety assessments were made throughout the study.",

The corresponding global systolic blood pressure trough: peak ratio was 0.83 for amlodipine and 0.68 for perindopril. Individual trough: peak ratios were non-normally distributed. Mean (+/- SD) individual trough: peak ratios (intent-to-treat analysis) for diatolic blood pressure were 0.50 +/- 0.69 for amlodipine (median 0.42) and 0.15 +/- 3.27 for perindopril (median 0.33). In the per protocol analysis, the corresponding values were 0.50 +/- 0.72 (median 0.34) for amlodipine and 0.01 +/- 3.90 for perindopril (median 0.21). Both treatments produced comparable decreases in clinic systolic and diastolic blood pressure between days 0 and 60. Forty-eight hours after the last dose, both systolic and diastolic blood pressure were lower in amlodipine-treated patients than perindopril-treated patients. Amlodipine and perindopril were generally well tolerated. The most frequently reported adverse event was leg oedema in amlodipine-treated patients (19.1%), and coughing in perindopril-treated patients (14.3%).",

Determination of trough: peak ratios by the conventional approach or by an individual approach can yield disparate values. After omitting one dose, a condition imitating noncompliance, blood pressure was more effectively controlled with amlodipine than with perindopril.", 
    "68": "Previous studies have demonstrated that losartan can block the thromboxane A2 receptor on the vascular wall. The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of losartan on human platelet activation.", 
    "69": "Platelets were obtained from 15 healthy men, aged 26-40 years. Platelet activation was measured by changes in the light transmission of platelet-rich plasma stimulated by the thromboxane A2 analog U46619 (5 x 10(-6) mol/l) or ADP (10(-5) mol/l).", 
    "70": "U46619-stimulated platelet aggregation was significantly inhibited by losartan in a dose-dependent manner. Only a high dose of EXP 3174 (5 x 10(-5) mol/l), the in vivo active metabolite of losartan, was able to attenuate U46619-induced platelet activation. Captopril, an angiotensin I converting inhibitor, failed to modify U46619-induced platelet aggregation. Furthermore, the binding of [3H]-U46619 to platelets was competitively inhibited by losartan, whereas only a high dose of EXP 3174 reduced the binding of [3H]-U46619. Captopril failed to modify the binding of [3H]-U46619 to platelets. Losartan also reduced the platelet activation induced by ADP (10(-5) mol/l), a platelet agonist partially dependent on thromboxane A2. In addition, when thromboxane A2 generation was blocked by aspirin, ADP-induced platelet aggregation was inhibited to a similar degree to the inhibition induced by losartan. Exogenous angiotensin II did not elicit any modification of either U46619- or ADP-stimulated platelet aggregation.", 
    "71": "Losartan decreased platelet aggregation by a thromboxane A2-dependent mechanism. EXP 3174 was less potent than losartan in reducing thromboxane A2-dependent platelet activation. Captopril and exogenous angiotensin II had no effect on human platelet activation. These results suggest that losartan reduced thromboxane A2-dependent platelet activation independently of its effect on angiotensin II.", 
    "72": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of trandolapril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, on blood pressure, forearm blood flow and insulin sensitivity in comparison with nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system.", 
    "73": "This is a multicentre, two-way parallel-group, open-label comparative study in 90 overweight hypertensive patients, who were randomly assigned to treatment for 8 weeks with either trandolapril or nifedipine. At baseline and after treatment, all patients underwent an oral glucose tolerance test, an evaluation of their metabolic profiles and a euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp test. In a subgroup of 18 patients, a forearm study was carried out.", 
    "74": "Blood pressure fell by the second week of treatment and remained significantly reduced compared with baseline in both treatment groups. Plasma triglyceride levels were also significantly reduced after trandolapril therapy, but no significant changes occurred in the other metabolic parameters during treatment with either drug. During the euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp, whole-body glucose use was similar in the two treatment groups at baseline, and a moderate but statistically significant increase in insulin sensitivity was observed after trandolapril treatment (trandolapril: 5.0 +/- 0.2 versus 4.5 +/- 0.2 mg/kg per min; nifedipine: 4.1 +/- 0.3 versus 4.2 +/- 0.3 mg/kg per min; P < 0.05, versus baseline and trandolapril versus nifedipine treatment). Skeletal muscle glucose uptake was significantly higher after trandolapril than after nifedipine therapy (5.0 +/- 0.7 and 3.0 +/- 0.4 mg/min, respectively; P < 0.01). As forearm blood flow was similar in the two treatment groups at baseline and was unchanged after 8 weeks of therapy, skeletal muscle glucose extraction was significantly greater in the ACE inhibitor treated-group than in the nifedipine comparative group (trandolapril: baseline 21 +/- 2, treatment 24 +/- 3 mg/dl; nifedipine: baseline 18 +/- 3, treatment 16 +/- 2 mg/dl; P < 0.05, trandolapril versus nifedipine treatment).", 
    "75": "During short-term treatment, ACE inhibition with trandolapril was able to moderately improve insulin sensitivity, in comparison with calcium blockade, and this effect appeared to be independent of the haemodynamic action of the drug.", 
    "76": "To investigate the endocrine and renal effects of the dual inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme and neutral endopeptidase, MDL 100,240.", 
    "77": "A randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study was performed in 12 healthy volunteers.", 
    "78": "MDL 100,240 was administered intravenously over 20 min at single doses of 6.25 and 25 mg in subjects with a sodium intake of 280 (n = 6) or 80 (n = 6) mmol/day. Measurements were taken of supine and standing blood pressure, plasma angiotensin converting enzyme activity, angiotensin II, atrial natriuretic peptide, urinary atrial natriuretic peptide and cyclic GMP excretion, effective renal plasma flow and the glomerular filtration rate as p-aminohippurate and inulin clearances, electrolytes and segmental tubular function by endogenous lithium clearance.", 
    "79": "Supine systolic blood pressure was consistently decreased by MDL 100,240, particularly after the high dose and during the low-salt intake. Diastolic blood pressure and heart rate did not change. Plasma angiotensin converting enzyme activity decreased rapidly and dose-dependently. In both the high- and the low-salt treatment groups, plasma angiotensin II levels fell and renin activity rose accordingly, while plasma atrial natriuretic peptide levels remained unchanged. In contrast, urinary atrial natriuretic peptide excretion increased dose-dependently under both diets, as did urinary cyclic GMP excretion. Effective renal plasma flow and the glomerular filtration rate did not change. The urinary flow rate increased markedly during the first 2 h following administration of either dose of MDL 100,240 (P < 0.001) and, similarly, sodium excretion tended to increase from 0 to 4 h after the dose (P = 0.07). Potassium excretion remained stable. Proximal and distal fractional sodium reabsorption were not significantly altered by the treatment. Uric acid excretion was increased. The safety and clinical tolerance of MDL 100,240 were good.", 
    "80": "The increased fall in blood pressure in normal volunteers together with the preservation of renal hemodynamics and the increased urinary volume, atrial natriuretic peptide and cyclic GMP excretion distinguish MDL 100,240 as a double-enzyme inhibitor from inhibitors of the angiotensin converting enzyme alone. The differences appear to be due, at least in part, to increased renal exposure to atrial natriuretic peptide following neutral endopeptidase blockade.", 
    "81": "The role of arginine vasopressin (AVP) in the development and maintenance of arterial hypertension is controversial. Furthermore, it remains unclear whether chronic treatment with antihypertensive agents modulates levels of AVP, with potential secondary effects on vascular tone and fluid homeostasis.", 
    "82": "To investigate the relation between plasma AVP and arterial blood pressure in a population-based sample of 534 middle-aged subjects.", 
    "83": "Overall, levels of AVP were higher in hypertensive subjects (2.15 +/- 0.26 pg/ml; n = 289) than in normotensive subjects (1.45 +/- 0.15 pg/ml; n = 245; P < 0.05). (Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure > 160 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure > 95 mmHg, or receiving antihypertensive medication.) In untreated individuals, plasma levels of AVP were found to be correlated with both systolic (r = 0.15, P = 0.002) and diastolic (r = 0.14, P = 0.005) blood pressure. The differences between the lowest and highest quartile of AVP levels were 5.1 mmHg (P = 0.03) and 2.6 mmHg (NS) for systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, after adjustment for age and sex. Moreover, it appeared that the relation between AVP and blood pressure was particularly strong in subjects with low levels of renin (< 10 mU/l; n = 118; systolic blood pressure r = 0.24, P = 0.007; diastolic blood pressure r = 0.19, P = 0.03). Specifically, patients receiving monotherapy with diuretics (n = 39) or beta-blockers (n = 54) displayed elevated plasma levels of AVP (2.93 +/- 0.98 pg/ml and 2.74 +/- 0.74 pg/ml respectively); however, only in patients taking diuretics was this finding apparently independent of confounding variables. Other monotherapies with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (n = 9) or Ca(2+)-antagonists (n = 19) were not associated with levels of AVP.", 
    "84": "The data suggest that plasma levels of AVP display a discernible relationship with arterial blood pressure and hypertension, particularly when renin levels are low. In addition, with the exception of diuretics, no modulation of AVP levels is attributable to the intake of antihypertensive agents as it occurs in a population-based sample.", 
    "85": "The Systolic Hypertension in Europe (Syst-Eur) trial proved that blood pressure (BP) lowering therapy starting with nitrendipine reduces the risk of cardiovascular complications in older (> or = 60 years) patients with isolated systolic hypertension (systolic BP > or = 160 mm Hg and diastolic BP < 95 mm Hg). After the completion of the Syst-Eur trial on 14 February 1997, 3506 consenting patients (93.0% of those eligible) were enrolled in phase 2 of the Syst-Eur trial. This open follow-up study aims to confirm the safety of long-term antihypertensive therapy based on a dihydropyridine. To lower the sitting systolic BP below 150 mm Hg (target BP), the first-line agent nitrendipine (10-40 mg/day) may be associated with enalapril (5-20 mg/day), hydrochlorothiazide (12.5-25 mg/day), both add-on study drugs, or if required any other antihypertensive agent. On 1 November 1998, 3248 patients were still being followed, 86 patients had proceeded to non-supervised follow-up, and 43 had died. The median follow-up in Syst-Eur 2 was 14.3 months. At the last available visit, systolic/diastolic BP in the patients formerly randomised to placebo (n = 1682) or active treatment (n = 1824), had decreased by 13.2/5.2 mm Hg and by 4.6/1.6 mm Hg, respectively, so that the between-group BP difference was 1.7 mm Hg systolic (95% Ci: 0.8 to 2.6 mm Hg; P < 0.001) and 0.9 mm Hg diastolic (95% Cl: 0.4 to 1.5 mm mm Hg; P < 0.001). At the beginning of Syst-Eur 2, the goal BP was reached by 25.4% and 50.6% of the former placebo and active-treatment groups; at the last visit these proportions were 55.9% and 63.1%, respectively. At that moment, 45.9% of the patients were on monotherapy with nitrendipine, 29.3% took nitrendipine in combination with other study drugs. Until the end of 2001, BP control of the Syst-Eur 2 patients will be further improved. Cardiovascular complications and adverse events, such as cancer or gastro-intestinal bleeding, will be monitored and validated by blinded experts.", 
    "86": "Hypertension is a major disease in the black populations of sub-Saharan Africa and the USA. The prevalence of hypertension varies from 1-30% in the adult population. Differences in blood pressure (BP) between black and white patients have been documented. In this review genetic, endocrine and environmental characteristics, renal physiology and cardiac function are reviewed. Racial differences in renal physiology and socio-economic status seem to account for BP differences. Black hypertensive patients in sub-Saharan Africa are prone to cerebral haemorrhage, malignant hypertension, leading to uraemia and congestive heart failure, whereas coronary artery disease is relatively uncommon. Responses to antihypertensive drugs like the beta-blockers and the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are poor unless these agents are combined with a thiazide diuretic. Black hypertensive patients respond best to diuretics, vasodilators or calcium channel blockers. A profiled approach to the treatment of hypertension in black patients is suggested.", 
    "87": "The CONSENSUS trial was the first study to show prognostic improvement by an ACE inhibitor. Patients in NYHA class IV heart failure were treated with enalapril or placebo. After study completion (average 183 days) all patients were offered open-label enalapril therapy. This paper reports on the survival at the 10-year follow up of the patients randomized in the CONSENSUS trial.",

    "89": "At 10-year follow up, one patient was lost to follow-up. Five patients, all in the enalapril group, were long-term survivors (P = 0.004). Averaged over the duration of the trial (double-blind plus open-label extension) the risk reduction was 30% (P = 0.008), with a 95% confidence interval of 11% to 46%. At the end of the double-blind study period, mortality was considerably higher among patients who did not receive open ACE inhibitor therapy compared to those who did.", 
    "90": "After a treatment period of, on average, 6 months, enalapril was shown to be effective. The effect was sustained for at least 4 years i.e. for another 3.5 years. The present follow-up is the first heart failure trial where the full life-cycle has been followed from randomization. In severe heart failure, mortality is significantly reduced by enalapril. On average, the beneficial effect is maintained for several years and overall survival time is prolonged by 50% (from 521 to 781 days).", 
    "91": "The aim of this study was to determine whether angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor administration improves the endothelial function of patients with previously untreated essential hypertension. Using high-resolution ultrasonography, we measured the arteria brachialis diameter at rest, during reactive hyperemia (endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilatation [FMD]), and after sublingual nitroglycerin (endothelium-independent dilatator). Twenty-one previously untreated hypertensive patients participated in the study (13 men, 8 women; mean age, 39.1 +/- 15 years). In the 21 patients, the basal FMD was 5.02% +/- 4.1%. Two hours after the first 10-mg benazepril dose, the FMD was 6.67% +/- 3.9%, and after 1 month of daily 10-mg benazepril administration, the FMD was 5.59% +/- 2.9%. These changes were not significant compared with the baseline value. Nine patients had relatively normal FMD (>5%), whereas the other 12 patients had abnormal FMD (<5%) at baseline. In the latter group, the first 10 mg benazepril produced significant improvement in FMD, from 2.4% +/- 2.5% to 5.08% +/- 2.4% (P < 0.05), but 10 mg benazepril daily for 1 month resulted in no further improvement (4.78% +/- 2.7%) compared with the acute effect. No difference was found between groups with regard to age, gender, blood pressure, blood lipids, and basal arteria brachialis diameter. The previously untreated patients with essential hypertension have endothelial dysfunction, but individual differences were found. The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor treatment improves endothelial function only in those patients who had endothelial dysfunction before the treatment.", 
    "92": "Drug-induced hyperkalemia is an important but often overlooked problem encountered commonly in clinical practice. It may occur in the ambulatory as well as the impatient setting. Every evaluation of a hyperkalemic patient should include a careful review of medications to determine if a drug capable of causing or aggravating hyperkalemia is present. Medications generally produce hyperkalemia either by causing redistribution of potassium (beta2 -adrenergic blockers, succinylcholine, digitalis overdose, hypertonic mannitol) or by impairing renal potassium excretion. Drugs cause impaired renal potassium excretion by (1) interfering with the production and/or secretion of aldosterone (nonsterodial anti-inflammatory drugs, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-II receptor antagonists, heparin, cyclosporine, and FK 506) or (2) blocking the kaliuretic effects of aldosterone (potassium-sparing diuretics, trimethoprim, pentamidine, and nefamostat mesilate). Because severe renal insufficeiency is generally required to cause hyperkalemia, an elevated serum potassium concentration in a patient with mild-to-moderate renal failure should not be ascribed to renal failure alone. A careful search for \"hidden\" potassium loads and for causes of impaired tubular secretion of potassium (including drugs) is necessary. Finally, it is important to recognize that the causes of hyperkalemia may be additive. Patients may have more than one cause of hyperkalemia at the same time. Therefore, all potential causes of hyperkalemia, including drugs, should be systematically evaluated in every hyperkalemic patient.", 
    "93": "In clinical practice it is far from uncommon that antihypertensive drugs fail to meet their expectations. This is mainly due to mechanisms counteracting their antihypertensive effects. These mechanisms include stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), inhibition of the parasympathetic nervous system (PSNS), stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), as well as endothelium-dependent mechanisms. To review whether the activation of such mechanisms follows differential patterns depending on the type of antihypertensive therapy being used. The antihypertensive effects of diuretics and calcium channel blockers are largely offset by all of the mechanisms enumerated. The antihypertensive effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors/angiotensin II (AII) receptor antagonists and beta-blockers are counteracted by all of the mechanisms enumerated except for the effects of a stimulated RAAS and SNS, respectively. ACE inhibitors/AII receptor antagonists and beta-blockers display a better profile of mechanisms counteracting their antihypertensive effects than other categories of drugs currently available. However, because this is not routinely confirmed by random trial evidence, additional determinants of drug performance must be considered including between-subject disparities in drug response, metabolic effects, and proliferative effects.", 
    "94": "It is known that intermittent dobutamine therapy improves the symptoms and physical condition of patients with chronic heart failure, but its arrhythmogenic effect is insufficiently described. The aim of this study was to assess ventricular arrhythmias and the condition of patients before, during, and after intermittent dobutamine therapy. The 23 patients participating in the study were in New York Heart Association functional classes III and IV despite therapy with digitalis, diuretics, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Starting dosage of dobutamine was 2 microg/kg/min, which was raised gradually up to 12 microg/kg/min, or until the appearance of complaints or symptoms. In group I (7 patients), for 24 hours before dobutamine infusion, Holter monitoring had been performed. In the subsequent 24 hours, during the infusion, patients were monitored in the critical care unit, but the second Holter test was performed only after the infusion, i.e., in the third 24 hours. In group II (16 patients), the Holter monitoring was started 4 hours before dobutamine infusion and was continued for an additional 20 hours, during the drug administration. In the 24 hours after dobutamine treatment, another Holter monitoring was performed. There was no increase in frequency of ventricular arrhythmias after the dobutamine infusion compared with the preinfusion period, but during dobutamine administration, ventricular arrhythmias occurred more frequently than in the preinfusion and postinfusion periods. No ventricular fibrillation was observed in the 23 patients. In conclusion, ventricular arrhythmias are frequent in congestive heart failure, and dobutamine infusion increases their incidence. The arrhythmogenic effect of dobutamine subsides on the day after the dobutamine infusion. Because of the arrhythmogenic effect of dobutamine, admission to the critical care unit is suggested during the infusion, but monitoring is not necessary after the end of the infusion.", 
    "95": "Renal parenchymal hypertension is defined as hypertension caused by disease of the kidneys. Impaired renal sodium excretion leading to extracellular fluid volume (ECFV) expansion is the most clinically important mechanism leading to hypertension in patients with kidney disease. Most patients with renal parenchymal hypertension have sodium-sensitive hypertension, and, consequently, sodium restriction and loop diuretics constitute the initial steps in effective antihypertensive therapy in patients with renal disease. The loop diuretics (furosemide, ethacrynic acid, bumetanide, torasemide) are used for the management of ECFV and hypertension in patients with renal disease because thiazide diuretics are generally not effective in patients with serum creatinine values above 2.0 mg/dL or creatinine clearances below 30 mL/min. The Joint National Committee VI recommends the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in patients with hypertension and chronic renal disease to control hypertension and to slow progressive renal failure. Antihypertensive treatment with ACE inhibitors may favorably alter renal hemodynamics, thereby slowing the progression of renal dysfunction. ACE inhibitors have been found to be useful agents in preventing the progression of renal disease in the settings of established insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) nephropathy, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) nephropathy, IDDM patients with normal blood pressures and microalbuminuria, NIDDM patients with microalbuminuria and normal renal function, and a variety of non-diabetic renal diseases, especially in the setting of significant proteinuria. Calcium antagonists are effective for treating hypertensive patients with chronic renal impairment, and the initial results for calcium antagonists and for combination calcium antagonist-ACE inhibitor therapy have been encouraging. Although promising, the calcium antagonists and the new angiotensin II antagonists have not been studied as intensively as ACE inhibitors in regard to their ability to slow the progression of renal insufficiency.", 
    "96": "To assess the efficacy and safety of 2.5, 5, and 10 mg bisoprolol/6. 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), 2.5, 5, and 10 mg amlodipine; and 5, 10, 20, and 40 mg enalapril in subjects (n = 541) with a sitting diastolic blood pressure of 95 to 114 mm Hg, data from two comparative studies were pooled. All drugs were titrated to a diastolic blood pressure 90 mm Hg or less. Both studies were double-blind, randomized, parallel dose escalation trials with similar designs and included three active treatments. The second study also had a placebo group. The mean change from baseline of systolic and diastolic blood pressure for placebo (n = 79) was -0. 1/-2.2 mm Hg; amlodipine (n = 154), -12.4/-10.3 mm Hg; enalapril (n = 155), -9.4/-8.2 mm Hg; and bisoprolol/HCTZ (n = 155), -14.0/-12.0. Overall efficacy analyses documented a statistically significant decrease in sitting diastolic blood pressure for bisoprolol/6.25 mg HCTZ compared with placebo, amlodipine, and enalapril. There was a significant reduction in sitting systolic blood pressure for bisoprolol/6.25 mg HCTZ compared with placebo and enalapril but not amlodipine. Also, there was a significant decrease in sitting heart rate for bisoprolol/6.25 mg HCTZ (-6.2 beats/min) compared with placebo (+0.1 beats/min), amlodipine (+1.2 beats/min), and enalapril (+0.5 beats/min). The control rate (diastolic blood pressure < or = 90 mm Hg) for bisoprolol/6.25 mg HCTZ (66.5%) was significantly better than for placebo (21.8%) and enalapril (47.1%) but not amlodipine (58.4%). Of those patients achieving and maintaining control, 49% of the bisoprolol/6.25 mg HCTZ subjects were on the lowest two doses compared with 30% of the amlodipine and 26% of the enalapril subjects. Percentages of patients reporting at least one drug-related adverse event through week 12 were 27%, 24%, 28%, and 25% for placebo, bisoprolol/6.25 mg HCTZ, amlodipine, and enalapril (not significant). Lower doses of two drugs in fixed combination can provide as good or better blood pressure control compared with higher doses of a single drug with similar tolerability and safety.", 
    "97": "Pulmonary vascular responses to angiotensin (3-8) (Ang IV), leu3 angiotensin (3-8) (LeuAng IV), an Ang IV analog and angiotensin I (3-10) [Ang I (3-10)], the precursor for Ang IV, were investigated in the intact-chest cat under conditions of controlled blood flow. Intralobar injections of Ang IV, LeuAng IV, and Ang I (3-10) caused dosage-related increases in lobar arterial pressure. When responses were compared, Ang IV, LeuAng IV, and Ang I (3-10) were equipotent and were approximately 100- to 300-fold less potent than Ang II when dosages are expressed on a nanomolar basis. DuP 753, an angiotensin II type 1 (AT1 ) receptor antagonist, attenuated pulmonary vasoconstrictor responses to LeuAng IV, Ang IV, and its precursor, Ang I (3-10), but did not significantly change pressor responses to serotonin, norepinephrine, or U46619. PD 123319, an angiotensin II type 2 (AT2 ) receptor antagonist, and WSU 3033, a putative angiotensin II type 4 (AT4 ) receptor antagonist, did not significantly change pressor responses to LeuAng IV, Ang IV, and its precursor, Ang I (3-10). Captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, decreased pulmonary vasoconstrictor responses to Ang I (3-10) but did not significantly change responses to serotonin, norepinephrine, U46619, LeuAng IV, or Ang IV. These data show that LeuAng IV, Ang IV, and its precursor, Ang I (3-10), increase pulmonary vascular resistance by activating AT1 receptors, and that Ang I (3-10) is rapidly and efficiently converted by an ACE-dependent pathway into an active peptide. The present data suggest that Ang IV and LeuAng IV increase pulmonary vascular resistance by activating AT1 receptors and that activation of AT2 or AT4 are not involved in mediating or modulating responses to these peptides. These data provide support for the hypothesis that Ang I (3-10) is converted into an active peptide by ACE at or near the site of action within the pulmonary vascular bed.", 
    "98": "Ischemic renal disease (IRD) is defined as a significant reduction in glomerular filtration rate and/or loss of renal parenchyma caused by hemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis. IRD is a common and often overlooked clinical entity that presents in the setting of extrarenal arteriosclerotic vascular disease in older individuals with azotemia. IRD is an important cause of chronic renal failure and end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and many patients with a presumed diagnosis of hypertensive nephrosclerosis may actually have undiagnosed ischemic nephropathy as the cause of their ESRD. The primary reason for establishing the diagnosis of IRD is the hope that correction of a renal artery stenosis will lead to improvement of renal function or a delay in progression to ESRD. There are six typical clinical settings in which the clinician could suspect IRD: acute renal failure caused by the treatment of hypertension, especially with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors; progressive azotemia in a patient with known renovascular hypertension; acute pulmonary edema superimposed on poorly controlled hypertension and renal failure; progressive azotemia in an elderly patient with refractory or severe hypertension; progressive azotemia in an elderly patient with evidence of atherosclerotic disease; and unexplained progressive azotemia in an elderly patient. It is important for the clinician to identify IRD, because IRD represents a potentially reversible cause of chronic renal failure in a hypertensive patient.", 
    "99": "Hypertension occurs frequently in patients with renal disease and contributes to the development of end-stage renal disease. Because the renin angiotensin system (RAS) influences hypertension and renal disease, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been used successfully to treat and reduce renal consequences of hypertension. This review assesses how angiotensin II (A-II) influences renal disease and explores the effectiveness of losartan, a selective A-II receptor blocker, in patients with renal disease. Clinical trials have demonstrated that losartan is a safe and effective treatment for hypertension in renally impaired patients and produces renal hemodynamic effects akin to those seen with ACE inhibitors. However, losartan demonstrates a greater uricosuric effect than ACE inhibitors and does not produce cough, a significant side effect frequently associated with ACE inhibitors. Further studies will determine whether combination therapy with an ACE inhibitor and A-II receptor blocker will provide additional RAS blockade and synergistic benefits in patients with renal disease.", 
    "100": "It has been proposed that worsening of heart failure with dihydropyridines, such as nicardipine, is related to the activation of the neuroendocrine system. To test this, we evaluated 20 patients with severe heart failure (mean age, 55 +/- 13 years; New York Heart Association functional class III; left ventricular ejection fraction, 18% +/- 8% on maintenance therapy with captopril, digoxin, and diuretics) who were randomized to nicardipine (60 or 90 mg/d) or placebo during a 4-month double-blind protocol. The following measurements were obtained at baseline, monthly, and at 4 months or last follow-up visit: rest and exercise radionuclide ventriculography, maximal treadmill time, 6-minute walking test distance, serum norepinephrine and aldosterone concentrations, and plasma renin activity. During the follow-up period, worsening of heart failure occurred in 6 patients in the nicardipine group and in 2 patients in the placebo group (p = 0.06). The maximal treadmill time for a 6-minute walking distance and exercise radionuclide ejection fraction at the last follow-up visit did not change in patients who did not deteriorate with heart failure in the placebo or nicardipine groups as compared with baseline values. In this study group of patients with severe heart failure receiving therapy with digoxin, captopril, and diuretics, nicardipine was associated with worsening heart failure without an apparent activation of the neurohormones. However, because of the small number of patients and a significant number of patients who deteriorated during the follow-up period, no definitive conclusions can be made.", 
    "101": "We present a single-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of the effects on blood pressure and left ventricular mass and of the safety of a combined antihypertensive treatment with delapril, a new nonsulfhydryl angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and indapamide, a sulfonamide diuretic. We studied 28 elderly patients aged 65-85 years (mean age, 69 +/- 1) with sitting systolic/diastolic blood pressure of 160-200/95-115 mm Hg (at the end of the placebo period). After a 2-week placebo run-in, patients took 30 mg delapril in combination with 1.25 mg indapamide once daily for 24 weeks. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory blood pressure was monitored and M- and B-mode echocardiography were performed before and after 24 weeks of treatment. Blood pressure decreased from 156 +/- 1.5/101 +/- 1 mm Hg before treatment to 133 +/- 1/73 +/- 1 mm Hg after treatment. The total blood pressure burden also decreased; the percentage of measurements with a systolic blood pressure > or = 140 mm Hg and a diastolic blood pressure > or = 90 mm Hg decreased from 48.7% +/- 5%/31.5% +/- 4.3% to 23.5% +/- 4%/20.5% +/- 2.9% (p < 0.0005 and p < 0.05). The area under the curve of the 24-hour blood pressure decreased from 250 +/- 41/103 +/- 21 mm Hg to 97 +/- 21/37 +/- 8.5 mm Hg (p < 0.001 and p < 0.005). The left ventricular mass index (LVMI) in the 15 patients with pretreatment left ventricular hypertrophy was reduced after therapy from 167.5 +/- 8.5 g/m 2 to 152.2 +/- 7.6 g/m 2 (p < 0.05). A positive correlation was observed between percent changes of the area under the curve of the 24-hour diastolic blood pressure and percent changes of LVMI (r = 0.6; p < 0. 05) in the 15 patients with left ventricular hypertrophy. Only 2 patients reported side effects: 1 developed skin rash and 1 developed headache. The safety of the treatment was confirmed by laboratory tests. In elderly hypertensive patients, the combination of delapril and indapamide at low doses reduced blood pressure and had favorable effects on LVMI with few side effects.", 
    "102": "Arteriovenous fistula dysfunction is a constant problem in chronic hemodialysis patients. We investigated the factors influencing fistula dysfunction in 184 patients on chronic hemodialysis. Stepwise regression analysis and Cox proportional hazards model were used to assess the relationship between fistula dysfunction and age, sex, duration of hemodialysis, diabetes mellitus, hematocrit, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, Kt/V, prothrombin time, blood pressure, anticoagulant therapy, dose of erythropoietin, calcium channel blocker therapy, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy. Fistula dysfunction showed a significant relationship with a low systolic blood pressure, a low hematocrit, the presence of diabetes mellitus, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy. These results suggested that treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may help to prevent fistula dysfunction.", 
    "103": "The mechanism of quinapril's interaction with the organic anion transporter was characterized by studying its effect on the transport of p-aminohippurate (PAH) in rabbit renal basolateral membrane vesicles (BLMV). Cis-inhibition studies demonstrated that quinapril was a specific and potent inhibitor of PAH. The Ki of quinapril was about 20 microM, a value similar to that of probenecid and eight-times lower than the K(m) value of 165 microM for PAH. Even though quinapril resulted in trans-inhibition of PAH uptake during counterflow studies, kinetic studies revealed that quinapril was a competitive inhibitor of PAH transport. This latter findings suggests that quinapril and PAH share a common binding site on the transporter. Overall, the results indicate that quinapril is a high-affinity inhibitor of the organic anion transporter in renal BLMV, and that drug-drug interactions may occur with other organic anions at the basolateral membrane of proximal cells.",

The decline in systolic blood pressure was not significant with any of the two treatments, and no difference in reduction of blood pressure was seen between groups. LVM corrected for body surface area (LVMI) was comparable between groups at baseline and increased from 96 +/- 5 to 107 +/- 6 g/m2 (mean +/- SEM; P = 0.007) in the nisoldipine group and from 95 +/- 4 to 103 +/- 5 g/m2 (P = 0.03) in the lisinopril group. The mean difference between the change in LVMI in the two groups was 2.9 (95% CI 6.8 to 12.7) g/m2. The prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy rose from 18 (95% CI 6-30) to 30% (16-44) during the study period. A multiple linear regression analysis revealed that after 1 year of treatment, LVMI increased with higher systolic blood pressure level and declining glomerular filtration rate (R2 = 0.25).

    "108": "Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death in diabetic patients. It has been reported to count for almost 80% of all deaths. About three-fourths of these deaths result from coronary artery disease. Studies have shown that diabetic patients who have had an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) have a mortality of about twice that of nondiabetic patients. Various medications have been shown to improve the prognosis among diabetic patients suffering from ischemic heart disease. They include beta-blockers, thrombolytic agents, aspirin, ACE inhibitors, and lipid-lowering drugs. Experiences indicate that treatment with beta-blockers, thrombolytic agents, and ACE inhibitors is particularly advantageous in diabetic patients who have suffered AMI. Metabolic control also may be of major importance during the acute cardiac event because it is assumed that fatty acid metabolism is increased with a compromised glycolysis not only in ischemic but also in the nonischemic areas. One way to suppress free fatty acid oxidation is by the infusion of insulin-glucose. In the Swedish Diabetes Mellitus and Insulin Glucose Infusion in Acute Myocardial Infarction (DIGAMI) Study, patients with diabetes and AMI were randomized to receive insulin-glucose infusion followed by intensive subcutaneous insulin treatment or to be control subjects. The 1-year mortality was reduced 30% by insulin treatment. Diabetic patients who suffer from coronary artery disease have a particularly adverse prognosis. Previous experiences indicate that treatment with beta-blockers, thrombolytic agents, and ACE inhibitors is particularly advantageous in diabetic patients who have suffered AMI. Aspirin and lipid-lowering drugs should be offered to these patients on traditional indications as well. Metabolic control seems to be of major importance for the outcome.",

Despite this, these agents remain underused in clinical practice. Appropriate patient selection in standard clinical practice should be encouraged in order to achieve a mortality rate reduction comparable to that seen in clinical trials. It appears from the findings of recent studies that the greatest benefit from beta-blocker therapy is achieved in patients who are more than 60 years of age and in patients at moderate or high risk for reinfarction and death (eg, patients with LV dysfunction or arrhythmias or both). Patients with class I-IV heart failure treated with ACE inhibitors have fewer recurrent infarctions, a lower incidence of severe congestive heart failure, and a reduced incidence of total cardiovascular death and sudden cardiac death. In addition to the studies completed in patients with MI, there are ongoing studies evaluating whether or not ACE inhibitors can reduce myocardial ischemic events in patients without a prior infarction who have coronary artery disease or hypertension and preserved LV function. There is also growing evidence that concomitant therapy with a beta-blocker and an ACE inhibitor may reduce mortality rates beyond that observed with ACE inhibitors alone in survivors of MI who have LV dysfunction.", 
    "118": "Biological functions and processes, including cardiovascular ones, exhibit significant circadian (24-hour) and other period rhythms. Ambulatory blood pressure assessment reveals marked circadian rhythms in blood pressure both in normotensive persons and hypertensive patients, whereas Holter monitoring substantiates day-night patterns in electrocardiographic events of patients with ischemic heart disease. The concept of homeostasis, that is, constancy of the milieu interne, which has dominated the teaching, research, and practice of medicine during the 20th century,is now being challenged by emerging concepts from the field of chronobiology-the science of biological rhythms. Epidemiologic studies document the heightened morning-time risk of angina, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Circadian rhythms in coronary tone and reactivity, plasma volume, blood pressure, heart rate, myocardial oxygen demand, blood coagulation, and neuroendocrine function plus day-night patterns in the nature and strength of environmental triggers all contribute to this morning vulnerability. Homeostatically devised pharmacotherapies, that is, medications formulated to ensure a near-constant drug concentration, may not be optimal to adequately control diseases that vary in risk and severity during the 24 hours. Moreover, circadian rhythms in the physiology of the gastrointestinal tract, vital organs, and body tissues may give rise to administration-time differences in the pharmacokinetics and effects of therapies. Thus the same medication consumed in the same dose under identical conditions in the evening and morning may not exhibit comparable pharmacokinetics and dynamics. New technology makes possible chronotherapy, that is, increase of the efficiency and safety of medications by proportioning their concentrations during the 24 hours in synchrony with biological rhythm determinants of disease. The chronotherapy of peptic ulcer disease achieved by the evening dosing of H 2-receptor antagonists and of asthma by the evening dosing of special drug delivery forms of theophylline and morning methylprednisolone administration has proven to be beneficial. Controlled-onset extended-release verapamil constitutes the first chronotherapy of essential hypertension and ischemic heart disease; once-a-day bedtime dosing results in a high drug concentration in the morning and afternoon and a reduced one overnight. Studies demonstrate effective 24-hour control of blood pressure, including the attenuation of its rapid rise in the morning, without induction of nighttime hypotension. Moreover, this formulation effectively controls angina, especially in the morning when the risk of ischemia is greatest. Determination of the role of verapamil chronotherapy in the primary prevention of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality awaits the results of the CONVINCE trial now in progress.",

After preconstriction with phenylephrine was performed, endothelium-dependent and independent relaxations were assessed by infusing bradykinin (1 to 278 ng/min) and sodium nitroprusside (0.0001 to 3166 ng/min), respectively. Dose-response curves were constructed before and during enalaprilat coinfusion (1 microg/min for 40 minutes).",

Apparent maximal relaxation induced by bradykinin was 78%+/-9% in the control group and 48%+/-9% in smokers (mean +/- SD). ACE inhibition shifted the bradykinin dose-response curve to the left in both groups (P < .001) and was associated with a minimal increase in apparent maximal venodilation in nonsmokers (78%+/-9% to 83%+/-18%). In contrast, in smokers ACE inhibition augmented the magnitude of apparent maximal venodilation to values comparable to those observed in the control group (48%+/-9% to 102%+/-21%). In both groups the response to sodium nitroprusside was not affected by enalaprilat.", 
    "122": "This study shows that acute local ACE inhibition restores bradykinin-induced relaxation in smokers to values found in nonsmokers.

Of these patients, 25 had left atrioventricular valve replacement (LavVR) (18 mitral, six tricuspid in corrected transposition of the great arteries (TGA), one common in a univentricular heart), 13 had aortic valve replacement (AVR) and six had tricuspid valve replacement (TVR). The etiology of the valvular disease was congenital in all patients, and complicated by infective endocarditis in seven (16%). Fifteen patients had undergone previous procedures and 16 required simultaneous repair of associated lesions. The mean size of the implanted prosthesis was 26 mm (range: 19-29 mm) for LavVR, 29.7 mm (range: 23-33 mm) for TVR, and 21.9 mm (range: 19-25 mm) for AVR. Postoperatively, all patients received oral anticoagulation. The mean follow up was 6.8+/-3.5 years (total 290 patient-years).",

There were two sudden deaths, both in patients with complex congenital heart disease and heart failure (before the ACE inhibitor era), and one valve-related death from thrombotic occlusion of a mitral prosthesis. Five patients were reoperated on; three for patient-prosthesis mismatch, one for periprosthetic leak, and one for aortic dissection due to Marfan's syndrome. Thrombotic obstruction occurred in three patients; two in the tricuspid position were treated successfully with thrombolysis, but one in the left atrioventricular position proved fatal. After seven years, the survival rate was 93.4%.",

In the metoprolol group, the rise in the mean level of HbA1c, from 6.3 +/- 1.0% to 6.8 +/- 1.3% (P < 0.01), tended to be more marked than after quinapril, although there was no significant difference between the increments. The mean fasting serum glucose showed an increase from 9.1 +/- 1.9 mM to 10.1 +/- 2.8 mM (P < 0.01) which correlated significantly with the duration of diabetes (P < 0.01) and the increase in fasting serum triglycerides (P < 0.001).

These long-term studies with hard end points have demonstrated positive results for four different antihypertensive classes: diuretics, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers and ACE inhibitors. The major issue is the prevention of hypertensive complications such as myocardial infarction, heart failure or stroke. For achieving this primary goal blood pressure reduction--or ideally normalization--is of decisive importance. As recommended by the Deutsche Hochdruckliga (German \"Hypertension League\") specific and individualized treatment of hypertension should consider target organ protecting effects of the various antihypertensive agents. In many cases combination therapy will be necessary to control hypertension (blood pressure target < 140/90 mmHg).", 
    "143": "Biochemical evaluations of the effects of the sulfhydryl-containing angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (captopril) on the nephrotoxicity induced by doxorubicin in normal rats were carried out. A single dose of doxorubicin (15 mg kg-1) which caused nephrotoxicity was manifested biochemically by the elevation of serum urea after 24 and 48 h of administration. Also a severe decrease in total proteins and albumin after 4, 24 and 48 h was observed. Moreover, a decrease of non-protein sulfhydryl (-SH) concentrations in the kidney tissues after 24 h and an increase in the lipid peroxidation was observed after 4 h administration of doxorubicin. Captopril (60 mg kg-1 i.p.) injection did not induce any change in the biochemical parameters measured, however, captopril administered 1 h before doxorubicin ameliorated the biochemical toxicity induced by doxorubicin. This was evidenced by a significant reduction in serum urea and the lipid peroxidation after 4 and 24 h and a significant reduction in creatinine after 48 h. Also, the captopril amelioration was evidenced by an increase in total proteins and albumin after 4 and 24 h of doxorubicin administration. Captopril did not change non-protein sulfhydryl (-SH) concentrations or protein content in the kidney tissues. These results suggest that captopril may be beneficial as a protective agent against nephrotoxicity induced by doxorubicin.", 
    "144": "The morbidity and mortality associated with diabetes mellitus are essentially related to the vascular lesions that develop over time in this condition. Both the macrocirculation and microcirculation are involved, and as a consequence, vital organs such as the brain, retina, heart, and kidney and the limbs become damaged. Because microalbuminuria represents the earliest and probably most sensitive indication of endothelial dysfunction in diabetes mellitus, the results of pharmacologic intervention with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, which treat glomerular hypertension were the first indication of potential beneficial effects in reducing diabetic nephroplasty. The nature of endothelial dysfunction related to diabetes is probably not homogeneous, since microcirculation networks are affected at different periods and with variable intensity. This appears to be the case for the aorta, the heart, segments of the digestive tract, the skin, and the skeletal muscle, the largest consumer of insulin. Although the aorta and large arteries contain a small portion of the total blood volume, their distribution of blood flow (pulse pressure) to peripheral organs may affect endothelial function in the microcirculation. Changes in the structure of conduit arteries, partly responsible for the alteration in compliance characteristics, could well be related to the way these arteries are fed by the vasa vasorum system. This report describes a new in vitro approach to examine capillary permeability in normal and alloxan-induced diabetic rabbits. Preliminary results indicate that the size of terminal arterioles of the vasa vasorum (increased diameter) and the capillary permeability to albumin (markedly enhanced) in this specialized network are profoundly affected in the thoracic aorta obtained from diabetic animals. Albumin extravasation into the interstitial fluid compartment of the aorta is likely to lead to structural and physicochemical changes: in fact, removal of interstitial macromolecules via lymphatic drainage is poor in the blood vessel wall of large arteries. This experimental approach is likely to be useful in the exploration of medications affecting the structure and function of conduit vessels.", 
    "145": "The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays an important role in both the short-term and long-term regulation of arterial blood pressure, and fluid and electrolyte balance. The RAAS is a dual hormone system, serving as both a circulating and a local tissue hormone system (i.e., local mediator) as well as neurotransmitter or neuromediator functions in CNS. Control of blood pressure by the RAAS is exerted through multiple actions of angiotensin II, a small peptide which is a potent vasoconstrictor hormone implicated in the genesis and maintenance of hypertension. Hypertension is a primary risk factor associated with cardiovascular, cerebral and renal vascular disease. One of the approaches to the treatment of hypertension, which may be considered as a major scientific advancement, involves the use of drugs affecting the RAAS. Pharmacological interruption of the RAAS was initially employed in the late 1970s with the advent of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, captopril. ACE inhibitors have since gained widespread use in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, and diabetic nephropathy. As the roles of the RAAS in the pathophysiology of several diseases was explored, so did the realization of the importance of inhibiting the actions of angiotensin II. Although ACE inhibitors are well tolerated, they are also involved in the activation of bradykinin, enkephalins, and other biologically active peptides. These actions result in adverse effects such as cough, increased bronchial reactivity, and angioedema. Thus, the goal of achieving a more specific blockade of the effects of angiotensin II than is possible with ACE inhibition. The introduction of the nonpeptide angiotensin II receptor antagonist losartan in 1995 marked the achievement of this objective and has opened new vistas in understanding and controlling the additional biological effects of angiotensin II. Complementary investigations into the cloning and sequencing of angiotensin II receptors have demonstrated the existence of a family of angiotensin II receptor subtypes. Two major types of angiotensin II receptors have been identified in humans. The type 1 receptor (AT1) mediates most known effects of angiotensin II. The type 2 receptor (AT2), for which no precise function was known in the past, has gained importance recently and new mechanisms of intracellular signalling have been proposed. This review presents recent advances in angiotensin II receptor pharmacology, molecular biology, and signal transduction, with particular reference to the AT1 receptor. Excellent reviews have appeared recently on this subject.", 
    "146": "The aim of this study was to determine if the qualitative 99Tcm-DTPA captopril radionuclide test (CRT) can help predict the acute detrimental effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on renal function in hypertensive patients with solitary kidneys and chronic renal failure. Between 1991 and 1996, eight consecutive patients (6 males, 2 females) aged 27-73 years (mean 49.8 years) with known chronic renal failure and a solitary kidney referred for ACE treatment were included. 99Tcm-DTPA renography was performed at baseline and 1 h after the administration of 25 mg captopril within 1 week of each other. The CRT was performed in accordance with the criteria of the Working Party on the Diagnostic Criteria of Renovascular Hypertension with Captopril Renography. A beneficial or detrimental effect of subsequent ACE inhibitor treatment on renal function was determined by long-term follow-up (> or = 2 years). The CRT accurately predicted outcome in all eight patients subsequently treated with ACE inhibitors. In conclusion, our results suggest a role for qualitative 99Tcm-DTPA CRT in the prediction of renal function in patients with a solitary kidney and chronic renal failure subsequently treated with ACE inhibitors.", 
    "147": "The beneficial effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors on ameliorating cardiac fibrosis have been partially attributed to their ability to prevent the degradation of kinins. The potential role of bradykinin and the related signaling molecule nitric oxide (NO) in modulating extracellular matrix (ECM) production was examined in primary cultures of adult rat cardiac fibroblasts. Treatment of fibroblasts with 5 nM bradykinin for 24 h led to a reduction in steady-state mRNA levels for fibronectin (34 +/- 7%) and collagens type I (19 +/- 8%) and type III (48 +/- 4%), as determined by Northern blot analysis. The NO synthase inhibitor L-NAME attenuated the reduction observed in fibronectin and collagen mRNA levels in response to bradykinin. The NO donor DETA NONOate (100 microM) mimicked the effects of bradykinin on ECM mRNA levels. Protein levels of soluble fibronectin, assessed in conditioned medium by ELISA, were decreased by 14 +/- 4% and 21 +/- 4% after 48 h treatment with 1 microM bradykinin and 100 microM DETA NONOate, respectively. Bradykinin stimulated intracellular cGMP accumulation 73.7 +/- 10.3% after 10 min of treatment. Cell proliferation rates at 48 h were unaffected by bradykinin, but were reduced by 26 +/- 12% by 100 microM DETA NONOate. These data indicate that bradykinin downregulates ECM protein production in cardiac fibroblasts and suggest that NO and the related signaling molecule cGMP may play an important role in mediating this response.",

The aim of the research was to bring the presence of proteinases (angiotensin converting enzyme) to cell culture users' knowledge and to give some data for solving problems about the development of peptides as useful drugs. The enzymes, purified from foetal bovine, adult bovine, foetal equine, adult equine, and human sera, showed molecular weights of about 170 kDa. Captopril and lisinopril inhibited enzyme activities at nanomolar concentrations. The enzymes were able to hydrolyze, with different efficiency, angiotensin I, bradykinin and epidermal mitosis inhibiting pentapeptide. The heat inactivation of commercial sera at 56 degrees C for 30 min showed a reduction of ACE activity of about 35-80%. Therefore, the presence of ACE activity in commercial sera can influence the activity of biological peptides tested on cell lines cultured \"in vitro.\"",

Higher pulse pressure was associated with increased prevalence of female gender, greater calcium channel blocking agent, digoxin and diuretic use, lower heart rate and a higher rate of reported smoking history. Higher mean arterial pressure was associated with higher heart rate, lower calcium channel blocker and digoxin use and lower New York Heart Association functional class. Over a 61-month follow-up 1,582 deaths (1,397 cardiovascular) occurred. In a multivariate analysis adjusting for the above covariates and treatment assignment, higher pulse pressure remained an independent predictor of total and cardiovascular mortality (total mortality relative risk, 1.05 per 10 mm Hg increment; 95% confidence interval, 1.01 to 1.10; p = 0.02).

Moreover, a synergistic reduction in mortality with use of both a beta-blocker and enalapril was suggested in the Prevention trial. After adjusting for important prognostic variables with Cox multivariate analysis, the association of beta-adrenergic blocking agent use with reduced mortality remained significant for Prevention trial patients receiving enalapril.

    "159": "Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) are a mainstay for the treatment of heart failure, and of diabetic microalbuminuria. Recently ACE-I have been found to decrease plasma levels of circulating vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (cVCAM-1) in patients with congestive heart failure. As increased cVCAM-1 levels are pathognomonic for diabetics with microangiopathy, we investigated the effects of ACE-I on plasma levels of cVCAM-1, intercellular adhesion molecule (cICAM-1), and cE-selectin in microalbuminuric diabetics. In addition, the effects of ACE-I on plasma levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) and of tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) were studied. Fosinopril (10 mg/day) was administered over 12 weeks to 11 microalbuminuric patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). As expected, baseline plasma concentrations of cE-selectin, cICAM-1, and cVCAM-1 were markedly higher in patients than in healthy control subjects (n = 82; P < .001). PAI-1 levels in NIDDM were similar to those in control subjects, whereas TPA levels were about 25% lower in patients than in control subjects (P = .013). Serum levels of cVCAM-1 decreased by -19% (CI: -25% to -13%) after treatment with fosinopril (P = .003) and were no longer different from those of the control group. In contrast, plasma levels of cE-selectin, cICAM-1, PAI-1, and TPA were unaffected. As expected microalbuminuria decreased by -44% (CI: -65 to -22; P = .004). In conclusion, fosinopril lowered cVCAM-1 levels along with microalbuminuria in NIDDM. This may represent a novel mechanism of action of ACE-I in diabetes-associated endothelial dysfunction. Whether decreased VCAM-1 expression is responsible for the observed reduction in microalbuminuria, deserves further investigation.", 
    "160": "Complex arrhythmia is frequent in hemodialysis patients but it is not clear if this is a consequence of dialysis or uremia or is secondary to the hemodynamic and cardiovascular alterations often associated with chronic renal failure. The incidence of complex ventricular arrhythmia (frequent multiform premature beats, couplets, and runs) in 31 subjects who had their uremic status recently corrected by renal transplant (Group 1) and in 23 predialysis (Group 2) and 73 hemodialysis (Group 3) chronic renal failure patients were studied with 24-h Holter monitoring. Patients were not receiving antiarrhythmic drugs or digitalis and significant coronary artery disease was excluded by clinical and noninvasive methods. Complex arrhythmia was two times more frequent in dialysis patients but the difference did not reach statistical significance (Group 1: 16%; Group 2: 17%; Group 3: 34%; chi2 4.9, P = .086). The stepwise model of logistic regression analysis identified systolic blood pressure (odds ratio 1.015, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.001-1.027, P = .03) and left ventricular systolic dysfunction (odds ratio 7.04, 95% CI 1.3-36.7, P = .02) as the only factors that independently influenced the probability of complex arrhythmia. Age, gender, race, diabetes, smoking status, body mass index, diastolic blood pressure, serum creatinine, hematocrit, left ventricular mass index, and use of diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, sympatolytics, and calcium channel blockers did not influence the occurrence of complex arrhythmia. The data indicate that blood pressure and myocardial dysfunction are more important determinants of complex arrhythmia than dialysis or uremia in chronic renal disease patients.", 
    "161": "A single-center, prospective double-blind randomized trial was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of the calcium channel blocker nisoldipine in a sustained release coat-core formulation (CC), titrated from 10 mg to 40 mg daily, with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril, titrated from 10 to 40 mg daily, in the treatment of black South African patients with severe hypertension (sitting diastolic blood pressure [DBP] between 115 and 140 mm Hg, confirmed by 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring). Treatment target was a sitting DBP < 95 mm Hg by the 9th week of treatment. This was followed by a 4-month open phase using nisoldipine CC 10 to 60 mg daily. Ninety-six patients had complete data at baseline, and at the end of the double-blind and open phases, and were included in this analysis. In both groups, all patients required titration up to the maximal dose of double-blind medication. Monotherapy with nisoldipine CC, but not enalapril, significantly reduced both sitting and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (BP). Twenty-four-hour BP in the nisoldipine CC group decreased from 179+/-14 / 118+/-7 to 144+/-16 / 94+/-10 mm Hg (P < .0001) versus 181+/-13 / 117+/-5 to 171+/-17 / 110+/-11 mm Hg in the enalapril group (P = ns). The profound decrease in blood pressure achieved with nisoldipine CC was accompanied by a significant reduction in left ventricular [LV] mass index, observed after only 2 months of treatment (from 146+/-40 to 129+/-35 g/m2, P = .05). In contrast, enalapril had no effect on LV mass (from 139+/-36 to 142+/-50 g/m2, P = NS). The antihypertensive effect of nisoldipine CC was further demonstrated in the open phase, during which 24-h BP decreased from 180+/-14 / 118+/-6 mm Hg (at baseline) to 142+/-16 / 92+/-10 mm Hg at the end of the 16-week open phase (P < .0001). This effect was sustained with trough-to-peak ratio of 74% for systolic and 67% for diastolic BP, with further regression in LV mass. Reduction in 24-h systolic BP to < 135 mm Hg was associated with a greater degree of regression of LV mass index in patients treated with nisoldipine CC. The incidence of adverse events in both groups was low and both nisoldipine CC and enalapril were well tolerated. The incidence of significant ventricular arrhythmia was also low and did not change with treatment. In conclusion, our findings suggest that nisoldipine CC administered once daily could be considered as a suitable first-line antihypertensive agent in black patients with severe hypertension, based on its profound and sustained blood-pressure-lowering effect, associated with significant regression of left ventricular mass and its low side effect profile.", 
    "162": "The effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition and angiotensin II receptor blockade on the development of cardiac hypertrophy and myocardial insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) in volume overload were studied in male Wistar rats with aorto-caval fistulas (ACF). Rats were treated with ramipril (RAM, 3 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) for 4-20 days or losartan (LOS, 10 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) for 2-7 days. Myocardial IGF-I and IGF-I receptor (IGF-I-R) mRNA were determined by solution hybridization. ACF caused hypertrophy of left (LV) and right ventricles (RV). Hypertrophy appeared on day 2 and reached maximal values of +60% in LV and +75% in RV at day 12. Systolic blood pressure was initially reduced 15% but recovered by day 12. RAM abolished the recovery of blood pressure. Furthermore, RAM attenuated RV hypertrophy by 17% on day 7 and on day 20, RV weights were close to values found in controls. Beginning on day 9, RAM reduced LV weight back to control levels in parallel to blood pressure. In contrast, LOS affected neither RV nor LV hypertrophy. RV IGF-I mRNA increased 60-100% on day 7 alone in RV in ACF. RAM potentiated the increase in RV IGF-I to +400% and induced an increase in RV IGF-I-R mRNA on day 7 (+90%) in ACF. LOS did not affect RV IGF-I. Development of cardiac hypertrophy in ACF seemed independent of angiotensin II. RV hypertrophy was associated with activation of IGF-I independent of the renin-angiotensin system. IGF-I was further potentiated when development of hypertrophy was attenuated, possibly indicative of a greater urge for compensational growth in a relatively thinner and more volume-distended chamber.",

All physicians and medical-care providers will have an increasingly important role in the detection and management of renal failure in patients who are not undergoing dialysis. Patients with diabetes or hypertension should be carefully monitored for the development of renal insufficiency by using screening tools such as blood pressure measurement, determination of serum creatinine, urinalysis, and determination of 24-hour urinary microalbuminuria. In order to slow the progression of renal disease, attenuate uremic complications, and prepare patients with renal failure for renal replacement therapy, all medical-care providers should \"take care of the BEANS.\" Blood pressure should be maintained in a target range lower than 130/85 mm Hg, and in many patients, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may be beneficial. Erythropoietin should be used to maintain the hemoglobin level at 10 to 12 g/dL. Access for long-term dialysis should be created when the serum creatinine value increases above 4.0 mg/dL or the glomerular filtration rate declines below 20 mL/min. Nutritional status must be closely monitored in order to avoid protein malnutrition and to initiate dialysis before the patient's nutritional status has deteriorated. Nutritional care also involves correction of acidosis, prevention and treatment of hyperphosphatemia, and administration of vitamin supplements to provide folic acid. Specialty referral to nephrology should occur when the creatinine level increases above 3.0 mg/dL or when the involvement of a nephrologist would be beneficial for ongoing management of the patient.", 
    "169": "To examine the long-term effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril on chronic heart failure, 10 patients (7 men and 3 women, mean age: 62 +/- 11 years) with chronic stable heart failure, classified as New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class 2-3 for more than 3 months, and a left ventricular ejection fraction less than 45% were treated with 2.5-5.0 mg of enalapril once a day for 3-15 months (mean 7 months). The causes of heart failure were old myocardial infarction (n = 7), hypertension (n = 2), and atrial fibrillation (n = 1). Radioiodinated metaiodobenzyl guanidine (123I-MIBG) imaging, radionuclide angiography, and treadmill exercise test were performed before and after the treatment. With enalapril treatment, (1) left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) increased significantly from 38.3 +/- 6.9% to 47.5 +/- 14.7%; (2) sub-maximal exercise time increased significantly from 205 +/- 112 to 272 +/- 120 seconds; (3) the heart to mediastinum (H/M) ratio of 123I-MIBG increased significantly (early image: 1.99 +/- 0.38 versus 2.20 +/- 0.50; delayed image: 1.86 +/- 0.44 versus 2.09 +/- 0.51); and (4) the washout rate of 123I-MIBG decreased slightly from 29.1 +/- 9.1% to 25.4 +/- 7.0%. The improvement rate of LVEF was significantly correlated with the improvement rates of the H/M ratio and washout rate after treatment with enalapril. Thus, the long-term effects of enalapril can be observed in the cardiac sympathetic nervous system, and 123I-MIBG imaging appears to be useful for evaluating the therapeutic effects of enalapril on the cardiac sympathetic nervous system in patients with chronic heart failure.", 
    "170": "Up to 40% of patients with heart failure have isolated diastolic dysfunction. With proper management, the prognosis is generally more favorable than in systolic dysfunction.

Specific antihypertensive drug therapy is available if lifestyle interventions fail to reduce blood pressure to a normal level. Diuretics and beta blockers both reduce the occurrence of adverse events related to cerebrovascular disease; however, diuretics are more effective in reducing events related to coronary heart disease. Treated patients are less likely to develop severe hypertension or congestive heart failure. In most instances, low-dose diuretic therapy should be used as initial antihypertensive therapy in the elderly. A long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker may be used as alternative therapy in elderly patients with isolated systolic hypertension. Trials are being conducted to evaluate the long-term effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-II receptor blockers in elderly patients with uncomplicated hypertension.", 
    "172": "The therapeutic actions of captopril are facilitated by its sulfhydryl moiety which interacts with the metal (Zn2+) prosthetic groups of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE; EC 3.4.15.1). This study focused on captopril as an inhibitor of another metal-dependent (Cu2+) enzyme, peptidylglycine-alpha-hydroxylating monooxygenase (PHM; EC 1.14.17.3). PHM is rate limiting in alpha-amidation, a COOH-terminal modification that bioactivates several pressor peptides. Captopril inhibited PHM in vitro in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 of approximately 100 micromol/l. This inhibition was partially reversed by increased concentrations of Cu2+. Structurally similar nonsulfhydryl ACE inhibitors did not affect the activity of PHM. The present findings indicate that the therapeutic effectiveness of captopril may result from actions on a range of metalloenzymes including ACE and PHM.", 
    "173": "Renin-angiotensin system has long been thought to be a classic endocrine negative feedback system in the pathophysiology of hypertension. Furthermore, angiotensin II formation was believed to be regulated by renin secreted from the kidneys. In contrast to these considerations is the identification of local angiotensin II production in other tissues than pulmonary vasculature. Prorenin, the molecular precursor of renin, has been assumed to be involved in local angiotensin II production because of its renin-like activity. Prorenin has also been found to be secreted from extrarenal sources, although a major part of it is derived from the kidneys. Increased concentration of total renin in serum has been proposed to be useful in identifying patients with active proliferative retinopathy in insulin-dependent diabetic patients. Renin-angiotensin system is strongly affected by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and therefore the interfering effect of ACE inhibitor medication on total renin concentration should be known in order to interpret serum total renin concentrations. Nine hypertensive outpatients, all men, treated at the department of internal medicine in Turku University Central Hospital, received randomly 5 mg of ramipril or 95 mg of metoprolol once a day for 4 weeks. Ramipril significantly increased the mean value of total renin (191.9 ng/l vs 312.0 ng/l, p < 0.01), but the metoprolol-induced increase in the concentration of serum total renin was insignificant. We conclude that the negative feedback mechanism in regulating renin and prorenin secretion was inhibited by ACE inhibitor ramipril but beta 1-selective adrenoceptor antagonist metoprolol did not significantly change total renin concentration in serum.", 
    "174": "One of the most important characteristics of chronic renal failure (CRF) is its progression to end stage renal disease. CRF progression depends of many factors indicated in numerous experimental and clinical studies. The present study was undertaken with the aim to examine the role of sex, etiology of CRF, renal function at the beginning of the study, hypertension and protein intake on CRF progression. Ninety-two patients (47 female and 45 male) aged between 17 and 70, with various underlying kidney diseases and various degrees of CRF were followed for 8 years. CRF progression was expressed as Creatinine clearance (CCr) and reciprocal values of serum Creatinine (SCr) against time. CRF progression was slower in women than in men, but not significantly. Patients with diabetic nephropathy (b = 0.00006) and glomerulonephritis (b = 0.00005) had faster progression of CRF than patients with nephrosclerosis (b = 0.00002), tubulointerstitial nephritis (b = 0.00003) and polycystic kidney disease (b = 0.00003). The fastest progression of CRF was in patients with the lowest SCr values at the beginning of the study. Proper regulation of blood pressure was the most important factor in slowing down CRF progression, independently of kind of antihypertensive drugs. Neither angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (b = -0.00001) nor calcium channel blockers (b = -0.00002) showed better effects on CRF progression slowing down in comparison with other antihypertensive drugs (b = -0.00001). Low protein diet slowed down CRF progression, but not significantly. In conclusion, our retrospective study confirms that CRF progression depends on sex, underlying renal diseases and serum Creatinine levels at the beginning of the study. Good regulation of blood pressure and low protein diet can slow down CRF progression.",

The second goal will be the argument of the present paper. Two-hundred fifty < or = 75 years consecutive patients (mean age: 58 yrs, males = 203) with acute myocardial infarction were randomly allocated to receive for > or = 3 months captopril (up to 75 mg/day, Group 1), metoprolol (up to 200 mg/day, Group 2) or captopril + metoprolol (Group 3) starting in the first 24 hours after the onset of symptoms. Intravenous beta-blockers in the acute phase of myocardial infarction and all other cardioactive drugs were allowed. The effect of the randomized therapy at six months from admission to the coronary care unit was considered in relation to: 1. recurrence of spontaneous cardiac events and of elective revascularization procedures; 2. adverse reactions (hypotension, atrioventricular block, cough, allergy, need of beta-blockers in Group 1, need for ACE inhibition in Group 2) requiring treatment modification based on physician's decision.",

In these patients (per protocol analysis), 37 spontaneous cardiac events occurred: cardiac death = 6, non-fatal reinfarction = 9, unstable angina requiring hospitalization = 16, congestive heart failure = 6. Moreover, seven patients received a coronary revascularization procedure. Events occurred in 11/67 patients from Group 1, 16/63 patients from Group 2, 10/65 patients from Group 3 (16% vs 25% vs 15%, p = 0.28). The multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated an increased odds ratio (OR) for spontaneous cardiac events in patients from Group 2 (OR = 2.82, 95% Cl: 1.16-6.87: p < 0.05). Elective revascularization procedures were statistically less frequent in patients treated with metoprolol (Group 1 = 9%, Group 2 = 1.6%, Group 3 = 0%; Group 1 vs Groups 2 and 3; p = 0.03). The intention-to-treat analysis on the overall population (226 patients) confirmed the presence of a trend towards a higher risk in patients from Group 2 (OR = 2.1, 95% Cl: 0.96-4.59; p = 0.06). Adverse reactions were observed in 16 patients from Group 1, 6 patients from Group 2 and 15 patients from Group 3 (22% vs 10% vs 23%; Group 2 vs Groups 1 and 3; p = 0.08).

    "178": "Congestive heart failure constitutes an important public health problem, because of its prevalence and mortality, and also its morbidity and significant resource utilization. It is the main cause of hospitalization for patients aged 65 or over, and it absorbs 2% of the health care budget in industrialized countries. With the aging of the population and the advancing age of the baby boom generation, the situation will worsen: the prevalence of congestive heart failure in Europe may increase by 70% by the year 2010. To favourably alter these economic consequences, treatment must not only prolong life but also slow down or even prevent disease progression towards more severe stages and decrease resource utilization, mainly in reducing the need for hospital admissions. To date, the most convincing results of economic analyses concern vasodilators: the hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate combination and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE). Even if all these studies do not come to the same conclusions in terms of numbers, they agree in showing that costs per year of life saved by vasodilators, and particularly by ACE, are very favourable (< $10,000 per year of life saved) and much lower than those of most other well accepted medical strategies.", 
    "179": "The benefit of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (i) therapy in diabetic glomerulosclerosis is thought to be largely the result of attenuation of angiotensin II (AngII) effects on blood pressure, glomerular hemodynamics and hypertrophy, and tissue fibrosis. The present study was undertaken to determine whether the addition of AngII receptor antagonist therapy to ACEi therapy in diabetic nephropathy results in attenuation of AngII effects beyond that achieved by ACEi therapy alone. Seven patients were studied as inpatients on the General Clinical Research Center each for 3 consecutive weeks as follows: week 1, the patients' usual regimen which included daily oral moderate to high dose ACEi therapy; week 2, the patients' usual regimen plus oral losartan (an antagonist (a) of the angiotensin type 1 receptor, AT1) 50 mg (n = 3) or 100 mg (n = 4) daily; week 3, return to the patients' usual regimen. Diet, physical activity, and blood glucose were held as constant as possible during the three weeks of daily testing. We found that plasma renin levels increased significantly during combination therapy and then returned to baseline values with discontinuation of AT1a therapy: mean baseline renin values (week 1) 3.0 ng/ml/min +/- 1.1 SE, mean renin values during combination therapy (week 2) 7.0 ng/ml/min +/- 3.2 (p = 0.0078 by Wilcoxon rank sum test), mean renin values after discontinuation of AT1a therapy (week 3) 3.9 ng/ml/min +/- 2.0 (NS compared to baseline values). In addition, 2 patients developed transient hypotension when losartan therapy was initiated. During this short-term study, 24-hour proteinuria, serum creatinine, serum potassium, and plasma aldosterone were not changed significantly by combination therapy. We conclude that in patients with diabetic nephropathy addition of AT1a therapy to ACEi therapy attenuates AngII effects better than ACEi therapy alone. We suggest that combination therapy for the management of diabetic glomerulosclerosis merits further investigation.", 
    "180": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are established as first-line therapy in chronic heart failure (CHF). However, little is known about the dosage-plasma-level relationship of ACE inhibitors in CHF and its relation to drug-induced adverse effects. We investigated 45 patients (age 55 +/- 10 years) with stable CHF who presented with a maintenance dosage of enalapril of either 5 mg b.i.d. (E10, n = 16), 10 mg b.i.d. (E20, n = 18), or 20 mg b.i.d. (E40, n = 11). This dosage was changed three times to treat all patients with lower, higher, and, finally, the initial dosage for 4 weeks each. Patients were examined clinically, by questionnaire, and by spiroergometry. In addition, neurohormones (atrial and brain natriuretic peptide and norepinephrine), enalaprilat trough levels, and serum potassium and creatinine were measured. Enalaprilat trough levels differed significantly between the three groups at study entry but also varied markedly within each group. In addition to the dose of enalapril, serum creatinine, severity of CHF, basal metabolic rate, and body weight significantly influenced enalaprilat trough levels (R2 =.84, p <.001). Within-patient comparisons revealed that serum creatinine (107 +/- 26 versus 102 +/- 20 micromol/liter) and potassium (3.8 +/- 0.4 versus 3.7 +/- 0. 3mmol/liter) were higher, cough was more common (scored on a scale of 0-8: 1.7 +/- 2.1 versus 1.4 +/- 1.8), and blood pressure was lower (systolic, 112 +/- 14 versus 117 +/- 13 mm Hg; diastolic, 66 +/- 9 versus 69 +/- 11 mm Hg) on the highest than on the lowest enalaprilat trough level (all p <.05). Highly variable enalaprilat trough levels and the fact that adverse effects were more common on high enalaprilat trough levels provide a rationale for individually adjusting ACE-inhibitor dose in case of adverse effects.",

Given that NEP and ACE metabolize angiotensin (Ang) and bradykinin (BK) peptides, we investigated the effects of NEP inhibition and combined NEP and ACE inhibition on Ang and BK levels in rats with myocardial infarction. We administered the NEP inhibitor ecadotril (0, 0.1, 1, 10, and 100 mg/kg/day), either alone or together with the ACE inhibitor perindopril (0.2 mg/kg/day) by 12-hourly gavage from day 2 to 28 after infarction. Ecadotril increased urine cyclic GMP and BK-(1-9) excretion. Perindopril potentiated the effect of ecadotril on urine cyclic GMP excretion. Neither perindopril nor ecadotril reduced cardiac hypertrophy when administered separately, whereas the combination of perindopril and 10 or 100 mg/kg/day ecadotril reduced heart weight/body weight ratio by 10%. Administration of ecadotril to perindopril-treated rats decreased plasma Ang-(1-7) levels, increased cardiac BK-(1-9) levels, and increased Ang II levels in plasma, kidney, aorta, and lung. These data demonstrate interactions between the effects of NEP and ACE inhibition on remodeling of the infarcted heart and on Ang and BK peptide levels. Whereas increased cardiac BK-(1-9) levels may contribute to the reduction of cardiac hypertrophy, the reduction in plasma Ang-(1-7) levels and increase in Ang II levels in plasma and tissues may compromise the therapeutic effects of combined NEP/ACE inhibition.",

Many data in this field come from studies in the African-American population. Hypertension-related complications, e.g. ischaemic heart disease, (end stage) renal failure and cerebrovascular disease, are encountered more often among blacks and frequently run a more severe course. Factors that might explain the racial difference in prevalence of hypertension and hypertensive complications include both genetic and environmental variables. Hypertension in blacks is characterized by salt sensitivity, a tendency towards expanded plasma volume and low plasma renin levels. Socioeconomic factors, the higher prevalence of obesity and insulin resistance may contribute to the high prevalence of hypertension in blacks. Aggressive antihypertensive therapy appears mandatory in the black hypertensive, possibly with lower goal blood pressures than the 140/90 mmHg generally recommended. Diuretic monotherapy proves to be the first-line therapy, calcium channel blockers are an attractive alternative. Black patients are frequently less responsive to monotherapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blocking agents. This black/white difference in therapeutic response can, however, be eliminated by addition of a diuretic.",

    "201": "Two novel mechanisms of organophosphate resistance were isolated and characterized from a population of Culex pipiens L. from Cyprus. Two strains, one expressing the novel, highly active esterases A5 and B5 (strain A5B5-R), and one expressing insensitive acetylcholinesterase (strain Ace-R), were developed by single pair crosses and selection with temephos and propoxur, respectively. The A5B5-R strain demonstrated resistance toward organophosphate insecticides that could be suppressed by the esterase inhibitor S,S,S-tributyl phosphorotrithioate (DEF). No cross-resistance to carbamates occurred. The Ace-R strain demonstrated resistance to organophosphate as well as to carbamate insecticides. Propoxur and temephos resistance was not affected by the monooxygenase inhibitor piperonyl butoxide or by DEF. The Ace-R strain possessed a novel toxicologic profile as well as a unique acetylcholinesterase inhibition pattern. Inheritance of temephos or propoxur resistance was codominant in F1 offspring. Backcrosses to a susceptible strain in both cases failed to fit a single gene model, suggesting that multiple loci may be involved. Combining the A5B5-R and the Ace-R strains resulted in high levels of temephos resistance, similar to that of the parents.",

The new compounds were tested against the contractile effect induced by desArg9BK on 2 B1 receptor bioassays, the human umbilical vein, and the rabbit aorta. Their antagonistic activities were compared with those of the early prototypes (Lys-[Leu8]desArg9BK and [Leu8]desArg9BK) and with other recently described peptide antagonists. The 3 (alphaMe)Phe analogues showed high antagonistic potencies (pA2) at both the human (8.8, 7.7, and 8. 7, respectively) and rabbit (8.6, 7.8, and 8.6, respectively) B1 receptors. No antagonistic effects (pA2<5) were observed on the B2 receptors that mediate the contractile effects of BK on the human umbilical vein, the rabbit jugular vein, and the guinea pig ileum. Moreover, these new B1 antagonists were found to be resistant to in vitro degradation by purified angiotensin-converting enzyme from rabbit lung. The Nalpha-acetylated forms, R 892 and R 914, were resistant to aminopeptidases from human plasma. In vivo antagonistic potencies (ID50) of B1 receptor antagonists were evaluated in anesthetized lipopolysaccharide-treated (for B1 receptor) and nontreated (for B2 receptor) rabbits against the hypotensive effects of exogenous desArg9BK and BK. R 892 efficiently inhibited (ID50 2.8 nmol/kg IV) hypotension induced by desArg9BK without affecting that evoked by BK (ID50 >600 nmol/kg IV). Conversely, the peptide antagonists Lys-Lys-[Hyp3,Igl5,D-Igl7,Oic8]desArg9BK (B 9858) and DArg-[Hyp3,Thi5,D-Tic7,Oic8] desArg9BK (S 0765) showed dual B1/B2 receptor antagonism in vitro and in vivo. It is concluded that R 892 and congeners provide selective, highly potent, and metabolically stable B1 kinin receptor antagonists that can be useful for the assessment of the physiological and pathological roles of kinin B1 receptors.", 
    "211": "We investigated the contributions of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and glomerular filtration to creating the new metabolic balance of the hemoregulatory peptide N-acetyl-seryl-aspartyl-lysyl-proline (AcSDKP) that occurs during acute and chronic ACE inhibition in healthy subjects. We also studied the effect of chronic renal failure on the plasma concentration of AcSDKP during long-term ACE inhibitor (ACEI) treatment or in its absence. In healthy subjects, a single oral dose of 50 mg captopril (n=32) and a 7-day administration of 50 mg captopril BID (n=10) resulted in a respective 42-fold (range, 18- to 265-fold) and 34-fold (range, 24-fold to 45-fold) increase in the ratio of urinary AcSDKP to creatinine accompanied by a 4-fold (range, 2- to 6.8-fold) and 4.8-fold (range, 2.6- to 11.8-fold) increase in plasma AcSDKP levels. Changes in plasma AcSDKP and in vitro ACE activity over time showed an intermittent reactivation of ACE between each captopril dose. In subjects with chronic renal failure (creatinine clearance<60 mL/min per 1.73 m2), plasma AcSDKP levels were 22 times higher (95% confidence interval, 15 to 33) in the ACEI group (n=35) than the control group (n=23); in subjects with normal renal function, they were only 4.1 times higher (95% confidence interval, 3.2 to 5.3) in the ACEI group (n=19) than the non-ACEI group (n=21). Renal failure itself led to a slight increase in plasma AcSDKP concentration. In conclusion, intermittent reactivation of ACE between doses of an ACEI is the major mechanism accounting for the lack of major AcSDKP accumulation during chronic ACE inhibition in subjects with normal renal function.", 
    "212": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to slow the progression of chronic renal failure. However, the value of ACE inhibitors for the treatment of hypertension in renal allograft recipients has not been established. ACE inhibitors dilate the efferent glomerular arteriole, an effect that may aggravate the decrease in glomerular filtration rate resulting from cyclosporine-induced vasoconstriction at the afferent glomerular arteriole. Therefore, the goal of this double-blind, randomized study was to compare the antihypertensive and renal effects of the ACE inhibitor quinapril with those of the beta-blocker atenolol in renal allograft recipients in whom hypertension developed 6 to 12 weeks after transplantation. All patients received cyclosporine as an immunosuppressant and had stable graft function (serum creatinine concentration, <220 micromol/L) at entry into the study. Twenty-nine patients who received quinapril (daily dose titrated between 2.5 and 20 mg) and 30 patients who received atenolol (daily dose titrated between 12.5 and 100 mg) completed the 24-month study. The two groups did not differ in age, sex ratio, height, and weight before entry into the study. Quinapril decreased diastolic blood pressure from 96+/-1 to 84+/-1 mm Hg (average throughout treatment period), and atenolol decreased diastolic blood pressure from 96+/-1 to 83+/-1 mm Hg. The serum creatinine concentration did not change significantly in either group after 24 months (129+/-8 micromol/L at entry and 148+/-19 micromol/L after 24 months in the quinapril group and 131+/-6 micromol/L at entry and 152+/-15 micromol/L after 24 months in the atenolol group; P=NS for both groups). After 24 months, the change in urinary albumin excretion from baseline was -10+/-15 mg/d in the quinapril group and 52+/-32 mg/d in the atenolol group (P=0.03). These results show that quinapril and atenolol are effective antihypertensive drugs when used after renal transplantation. Moreover, compared with atenolol, quinapril has no adverse effects on graft function. The relative reduction in albuminuria observed with quinapril as compared with atenolol could indicate a beneficial effect of quinapril on long-term graft function.", 
    "213": "We examined the effects of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, perindopril, and a beta-blocker, propranolol, on cerebral arterioles in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP). The structure and mechanics of cerebral arterioles were examined in untreated Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) and SHRSP that were untreated or treated for 3 months with a high (2 mg/kg per day) or a low (0.3 mg/kg per day) dose of perindopril or propranolol (250 mg/kg per day) alone or in combination with the low dose of perindopril. We measured pressure, external diameter, and cross-sectional area of the vessel wall (CSA) in maximally dilated (with EDTA) cerebral arterioles. Treatment of SHRSP with the high dose of perindopril or the combination of propranolol and the low dose of perindopril normalized cerebral arteriolar mean pressure (50+/-1 [mean+/-SEM] and 43+/-2 mm Hg vs 50+/-1 mm Hg in WKY and 94+/-3 mm Hg in untreated SHRSP; P<0.05), pulse pressure (15+/-1 and 16+/-1 mm Hg vs 13+/-1 mm Hg in WKY and 35+/-1 mm Hg in untreated SHRSP; P<0.05), and CSA (1103+/-53 and 1099+/-51 microm2, respectively, vs 1057+/-49 microm2 in WKY and 1281+/-62 microm2 in untreated SHRSP; P<0.05). In contrast, treatment of SHRSP with the low dose of perindopril or propranolol alone did not normalize arteriolar pulse pressure (24+/-1 and 21+/-1 mm Hg) and failed to prevent increases in CSA (1282+/-77 and 1267+/-94 microm2). Treatment with either dose of perindopril or the combination of propranolol and perindopril significantly increased external diameter in cerebral arterioles of SHRSP (99+/-3, 103+/-2, and 98+/-3 microm vs 87+/-2 microm in untreated SHRSP; P<0.05), whereas propranolol alone did not (94+/-3 microm; P>0.05). These findings suggest that effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors on cerebral arteriolar hypertrophy in SHRSP may depend primarily on their effects on arterial pressure, particularly pulse pressure, whereas their effects on cerebral arteriolar remodeling (defined as a reduction in external diameter) may be pressure independent.", 
    "214": "We studied the enhancement of the effects of bradykinin B2 receptor agonists by agents that react with active centers of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) independent of enzymatic inactivation. The potentiation and the desensitization and resensitization of B2 receptor were assessed by measuring [3H]arachidonic acid release and [Ca2+]i mobilization in Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected to express human ACE and B2 receptor, or in endothelial cells with constitutively expressed ACE and receptor. Administration of bradykinin or its ACE-resistant analogue desensitized the receptor, but it was resensitized (arachidonic acid release or [Ca2+]i mobilization) by agents such as enalaprilat (1 micromol/L). Enalaprilat was inactive in the absence of ACE expression. La3+ (100 micromol/L) inhibited the apparent resensitization, probably by blocking the entry of extracellular calcium. Enalaprilat resensitized the receptor via ACE to release arachidonic acid by bradykinin at a lower concentration (5 nmol/L) than required to mobilize [Ca2+]i (1 micromol/L). Monoclonal antibodies inhibiting the ACE N-domain active center and polyclonal antiserum potentiated bradykinin. The snake venom peptide BPP5a and metabolites of angiotensin and bradykinin (angiotensin-[1-9], angiotensin-[1-7], bradykinin-[1-8]; 1 micromol/L) enhanced arachidonic acid release by bradykinin. Angiotensin-(1-9) and -(1-7) also resensitized the receptor. Enalaprilat potentiated the bradykinin effect in cells expressing a mutant ACE with a single N-domain active site. Agents that reacted with a single active site, on the N-domain or on the C-domain, potentiated bradykinin not by blocking its inactivation but by inducing crosstalk between ACE and the receptor. Enalaprilat enhanced signaling via ACE by Galphai in lower concentration than by Galphaq-coupled receptor.", 
    "215": "Kallidin (KD) is an important vasoactive kinin whose physiological effects are strongly dependent on its degradation through local kininases. In the present study, we examined the spectrum of these enzymes and their contribution to KD degradation in isolated perfused rat hearts. By inhibiting angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), aminopeptidase M (APM) and neutral endopeptidase (NEP) with ramiprilat (0.25 microM), amastatin (40 microM) and phosphoramidon (1 microM), respectively, relative kininase activities were obtained. APM (44%) and ACE (35%) are the main KD degrading enzymes in rat heart; NEP (7%) plays a minor role. A participation of carboxypeptidase N (CPN) could not be found.", 
    "216": "We examined the effects of quinaprilat, an active metabolite of quinapril (an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor) on the increase in intracellular concentration of Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) (Ca2+-overload) induced by lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) in isolated rat cardiomyocytes. LPC (15 microM) produced Ca2+-overload with a change in cell-shape from rod to round. Quinaprilat but not quinapril at 20 or 50 microM attenuated the LPC-induced increase in [Ca2+]i and the change in cell-shape in a concentration-dependent manner. Since quinaprilat has an inhibitory action on ACE and quinapril has practically no inhibitory action on ACE, it is likely that the inhibitory action of quinaprilat on ACE is necessary for the protective effect of the drug against LPC-induced changes. We therefore examined the effects of enalapril (another ACE inhibitor with the weak inhibitory action on ACE) and enalaprilat (an active metabolite of enalapril with an inhibitory action on ACE) on the LPC-induced changes. Both enalapril and enalaprilat attenuated the LPC-induced Ca2+-overload, suggesting that the inhibitory action on ACE may not mainly contribute to the protective effect of ACE inhibitors against LPC-induced Ca2+-overload. This suggestion was supported by the fact that neither ACE (0.2 U/ml) nor angiotensin II (0.1-100 microM) increased [Ca2+]i in isolated cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, application of bradykinin (0.01-10 microM) did not enhance the protective effect of quinaprilat against LPC-induced changes. LPC also increased release of creatine kinase (CK) from the myocyte markedly, and quinaprilat but not quinapril attenuated the LPC-induced CK release. Unexpectedly, both enalapril and enalaprilat did not attenuate the LPC-induced CK release. Neither quinapril nor quinaprilat changed the critical micelle concentration of LPC, suggesting that these drugs do not directly bind to LPC. We conclude that quinaprilat attenuates the LPC-induced increase in [Ca2+]i, and that the protective effect of quinaprilat on the LPC-induced change may not be related to a decrease in angiotensin II production or an increase in bradykinin production.", 
    "217": "We made use of targeted disruption of the mouse angiotensinogen (ATN) gene to examine the functional role of the ATN in the central nervous system. Both male and female ATN-deficient mice displayed the reduction of depressive-like behavior in the behavioral despair swim tests and spontaneous locomotor activity diminished. However, both male and female ATN-deficient mice showed no anxiogenic-like or memory-deficit behavior and there was no change in the pain threshold. We propose that endogenous ATN in the central nervous system may regulate the depressant state in the brain.",

The role of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in cardiac hypertrophy and nephropathy was examined in Tsukuba hypertensive mice (THM) carrying both human renin and angiotensinogen genes. 2. Tsukuba hypertensive mice were treated with 20 mg/kg per day lisinopril, 30 mg/kg per day hydralazine or nothing. Administration of drugs was performed for 6 months from 12 weeks of age; water intake and urine volume were measured and urine albumin excretion, heart to bodyweight ratio and the glomerulosclerosis index were examined. 3. Systolic blood pressure was significantly lowered by treatment with lisinopril and hydralazine. Urine volume, water intake and urinary albumin excretion were significantly decreased by lisinopril. When hydralazine was administered to THM, these parameters were transiently decreased, but eventually reached almost the same levels as those in the untreated group. The heart to bodyweight ratio was significantly decreased by lisinopril, but not by hydralazine. The glomerulosclerosis index was significantly lowered by lisinopril, but the index in the hydralazine group was not significantly different from that in the untreated group. 4. These results suggest that the RAS plays an important role in the progression of cardiac hypertrophy in THM. In addition, the RAS may also play an important role in the progression of nephropathy; however, this may also be partially regulated by elevated blood pressure in the short term.",

    "222": "Enalaprilat did not alter either resting coronary vascular tone or dilation with sodium nitroprusside, but potentiated BK-mediated dilation. Epicardial segments that constricted abnormally with pacing (-5+/-1%) dilated (3+/-2%) with pacing in the presence of enalaprilat (p = 0.002). Similarly, BK at a concentration (62.5 ng/min) that did not alter resting diameter in the constricting segments also improved the abnormal response to a 6+/-1% dilation (p < 0.001). Cardiac pacing-induced reduction in coronary vascular resistance of 27+/-4% (p < 0.001) remained unchanged after enalaprilat.",

Most (87%) fatalities were cardiovascular and 900 were SCDs. A significant reduction in SCD risk or a trend towards this was observed in all of the larger (N > 500) trials. Overall, ACE inhibitor therapy resulted in significant reductions in risk of death (random effects odds ratio [OR] = 0.83; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.71-0.97), cardiovascular death (OR = 0.82; 95% CI 0.69-0.97) and SCD (OR = 0.80; 95% CI 0.70-0.92).", 
    "228": "This analysis is consistent with prior reports showing that ACE inhibitors decrease the risk of death following a recent MI by reducing cardiovascular mortality. Moreover, this analysis suggests that a reduction in SCD risk with ACE inhibitors is an important component of this survival benefit.", 
    "229": "Enalopril treatment (20 mg every 12 hours) of 24 patients with essential hypertension and left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy established normal blood pressure (BP) after 8 weeks, and after 7 years had reduced LV mass index by 39% from 148 +/- 34 to 90 +/- 16 g/m2, and had normalized LV structure and function and QT dispersion. Stepwise reduction of the enalapril dosage from 40 to 30, 20, 10, and 5 mg/day during the eighth year caused no significant changes in BP, LV structure, LV systolic function, or QT dispersion, which all likewise remained unaltered during a further year of the 5-mg/day regimen. We conclude that for hypertensive patients in whom prolonged treatment with standard doses of enalapril has normalized BP, LV structure and function, and QT dispersion, significantly smaller doses are sufficient to maintain these cardiovascular achievements.", 
    "230": "The long-term prognostic importance of hyperkinesia is unknown following an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The American Society of Echocardiography recommends that hyperkinesia should not be included in calculation of wall motion index (WMI). The objective of the present study was to determine if hyperkinesia should be included in WMI when it is estimated for prognostic purposes following an AMI. Six thousand, six hundred seventy-six consecutive patients were screened 1 to 6 days after AMI in 27 Danish hospitals. WMI was measured in 6,232 patients applying the 9-segment model and the following scoring system: 3 for hyperkinesia, 2 for normokinesia, 1 for hypokinesia, 0 for akinesia, and -1 for dyskinesia. All patients were followed with respect to mortality for at least 3 years. WMI was calculated in 2 different ways: 1 including hyperkinetic segments (hyperkinetic-WMI) and the other excluding nonhyperkinetic segments (nonhyperkinetic-WMI) by converting the hyperkinetic segments to normokinetic segments. Hyperkinesia occurred in 736 patients (11.8%). WMI was an important prognostic factor (relative risk 2.49; p = 0.0001) for long-term mortality together with heart failure, history of hypertension, angina, or diabetes, previous AMI, age, thrombolytic therapy, arrhythmias, and bundle branch block. In a multivariate analysis including nonhyperkinetic-WMI, hyperkinesia was associated with a relative risk of 0.84, which was statistically significant (confidence intervals 0.74 to 0.96; p = 0.01). When hyperkinesia was included, both in WMI (hyperkinetic-WMI) and as an independent variable, no additional prognostic information (relative risk 0.93; p = 0.26) was obtained. An echocardiographic evaluation shortly after an AMI gave important prognostic information, especially if the information concerning hyperkinesia was included. If WMI is used for prognostic purposes, hyperkinesia should be included in calculation of the index.",

    "245": "Sildenafil, a selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), is the first in a new class of orally effective treatments for erectile dysfunction. During sexual stimulation, the cavernous nerves release nitric oxide (NO), which induces cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) formation and smooth muscle relaxation in the corpus cavernosum. Sildenafil facilitates the erectile process during sexual stimulation by inhibiting PDE5 and thus blocking the breakdown of cGMP. Sildenafil alone can cause mean peak reductions in systolic/diastolic blood pressure of 10/7 mm Hg that are not dose related, whereas the heart rate is unchanged. Sildenafil and nitrates both increase cGMP levels in the systemic circulation but at different points along the NO-cGMP pathway. The combination is contraindicated because they synergistically potentiate vasodilation and may cause excessive reductions in blood pressure. Erectile dysfunction is a significant medical condition that shares numerous risk factors with ischemic heart disease, and hence a substantial overlap exists between these patient groups. From extensive clinical trials, the most commonly reported cardiovascular adverse events in patients treated with sildenafil were headache (16%), flushing (10%), and dizziness (2%). The incidences of hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, and syncope and the rate of discontinuation of treatment due to adverse events were <2% and were the same in patients taking sildenafil and those taking placebo. Retrospective analysis of the concomitant use of antihypertensive medications (beta blockers, alpha blockers, diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and calcium antagonists) in patients taking sildenafil did not indicate an increase in the reports of adverse events or significant episodes of hypotension compared with patients treated with sildenafil alone. In clinical trials, the incidence of serious cardiovascular adverse events, including stroke and myocardial infarction, was the same for patients treated with sildenafil or placebo. Concurrent disease states, such as renal or hepatic impairment, or concomitant use of inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 isozyme CYP3A4 could increase systemic exposure to sildenafil. Since the US market launch in April 1998, monitoring of spontaneous adverse event reports in association with sildenafil has demonstrated a pattern that is generally consistent with the experience observed during clinical development, with the exception of infrequent reports of priapism. In conclusion, extensive clinical testing has shown that overall treatment with sildenafil for up to 1 year is well tolerated and is associated with a low incidence of adverse events that result in discontinuation of treatment in <3% of patients.",

    "255": "Regardless of the specific antihypertensive agent used, the most important aspect of the management of the patient with coexistent hypertension and renal disease is adequate control of the blood pressure. The current JNC VI recommendation is for a reduction to a target blood pressure of 130/85 mm Hg, or to a lower value of 125/75 in patients with greater than 1 g proteinuria per day. Impaired renal sodium excretion leading to extracellular fluid volume (ECFV) expansion is the most clinically important mechanism leading to renal parenchymal hypertension. Sodium restriction and loop diuretics constitute the cornerstone of effective antihypertensive therapy. Control of blood pressure in patients with chronic renal disease may be difficult without measures that address ECFV. JNC VI recommends the use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in patients with hypertension and chronic renal disease to control hypertension and to slow progressive renal failure. ACE inhibitors have been found by clinical trials to be useful agents in the settings of established insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) nephropathy, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) nephropathy, IDDM patients with normal blood pressures and microalbuminuria, NIDDM patients with microalbuminuria and normal renal function, and a variety of nondiabetic renal diseases, especially in the setting of significant proteinuria. Calcium antagonists are effective for treating hypertensive patients with chronic renal impairment but have not been studied as intensively as ACE inhibitors with regard to their ability to slow the progression of renal insufficiency independently of their blood-pressure-lowering effects. The initial results for calcium antagonists and for combination calcium antagonist-ACE inhibitor therapy have been promising.

This study sought to determine whether neurogenic inflammation occurs in the airways by examining the effects of capsaicin or substance P on microvascular plasma leakage in the trachea and lungs of male pathogen-free C57BL/6 mice. 2. Single bolus intravenous injections of capsaicin (0.5 and 1 micromol kg(-1), i.v.) or substance P (1, 10 and 37 nmol kg(-10, i.v.) failed to induce significant leakage in the trachea, assessed as extravasation of Evans blue dye, but did induce leakage in the urinary bladder and skin. 3. Pretreatment with captopril (2.5 mg kg(-1), i.v.), a selective inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), either alone or in combination with phosphoramidon (2.5 mg kg(-1), i.v.), a selective inhibitor of neutral endopeptidase (NEP), increased baseline leakage of Evans blue in the absence of any exogenous inflammatory mediator. The increase was reversed by the bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist Hoe 140 (0.1 mg kg(-1), i.v.). 4. After pretreatment with phosphoramidon and captopril, capsaicin increased the Evans blue leakage above the baseline in the trachea, but not in the lung. This increase was reversed by the tachykinin (NK1) receptor antagonist SR 140333 (0.7 mg kg(-1), i.v.), but not by the NK2 receptor antagonist SR 48968 (1 mg kg(-1), i.v.). 5. Experiments using Monastral blue pigment as a tracer localized the leakage to postcapillary venules in the trachea and intrapulmonary bronchi, although the labelled vessels were less numerous in mice than in comparably treated rats.

    "261": "We have investigated the influence of a novel angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist, candesartan cilexetil, on the oxidative state of renal tissue and renal function in 5/6 nephrectomized rats, and compared its effects with those of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril. Candesartan cilexetil (1 and 5 mg/kg per day), enalapril (5 mg/kg per day) and vehicle were orally administered once daily for 16 weeks after 5/6 nephrectomy. There was a marked degree of proteinuria evident prior to treatment, an average of 5.69 mg/mg creatinine in the nephrectomized rats, vs 1 to 2 mg/mg creatinine in the control group matched for species and body weight. Inhibition of development of proteinuria by candesartan cilexetil was dose dependent. Enalapril also significantly blunted the rise in urinary protein. Malondi-aldehyde content in the homogenate from the renal cortex increased significantly in the nephrectomized rats compared to control animals. This elevation of malondi-aldehyde content was unaffected by administration of either candesartan cilexetil or enalapril. Antioxidative enzyme (glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase) activities in the renal tissue were not affected by any active treatment. Elevation of lipid peroxide in remnant renal tissue suggests that oxidative stress may contribute to the progression of renal injury in the nephrectomized rats. Neither candesartan cilexetil nor enalapril affected antioxidant defenses in renal tissue in nephrectomized rats, indicating that mechanisms other than alteration in oxidative stress are involved in the renoprotective effects of candesartan cilexetil and enalapril.", 
    "262": "There is now abundant evidence that treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) ameliorates the progression of chronic renal disease. Attention has therefore focused on the role of the renin angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) system in mediating the development of progressive glomerulosclerosis and angiotensin II (Ang II) has been implicated in several processes thought to be important in the pathogenesis of this entity. Conversely, ACE is also known to catalyse the breakdown of bradykinin. Thus, ACE-I treatment results in elevated bradykinin levels which may cause selective efferent arteriolar dilatation, suggesting an alternative explanation for the beneficial effects of this class of drugs in chronic renal disease. The development of specific angiotensin type 1 receptor antagonists (AT1RA) has provided a means of testing the relative importance of these two mechanisms. In addition, AT1RAs differ from ACE-I in their effect on the RAA system in other aspects which may represent therapeutic advantages. This paper reviews studies which have compared ACE-I and AT1RAs in several rat models of chronic renal disease. Most have found similar beneficial effects including amelioration of proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis, which suggests that the effects of ACE-I are due to a reduction in Ang II activity and not due to increased levels of bradykinin. One long-term study has suggested greater renal protection with candesartan than with enalapril. However, conclusions as regards the relative efficacy of these two groups of agents in ameliorating the progression of chronic renal disease await the results of further long-term studies.", 
    "263": "The 1996 World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations for mild hypertension stressed the need to evaluate target-organ lesions as treatment criteria. The effects of both vascular and heart remodelling on hypertension must to be taken into account, as they adversely influence the prognosis of patients with hypertension. It was previously demonstrated that at least three classes of antihypertensive agents were able to decrease morbidity and mortality in patients with hypertension. Meta-analyses have shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors seem to have a marked effect on regression of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). However, the relationship between drug-induced LVH regression and reduced morbidity and mortality remains to be confirmed. The effect of antihypertensive agents on vascular hypertrophy, as assessed by intima-media thickness, and their involvement in reducing morbid events, also have to be determined at the vascular level. As experimental data have highlighted the involvement of angiotensin II in animal models of LVH and vascular hypertrophy development, the role of angiotensin II AT1 receptor blockers should also be assessed in this indication.", 
    "264": "Clinical trials of candesartan cilexetil conducted in Japan are reviewed. Candesartan cilexetil inhibited the pressor response to intravenous angiotensin II in healthy volunteers, with peak effects observed at 4 or 8 h after oral dosing; suppressing effects persisted up to 24 h. In 14 multicentre studies with 928 hypertensive patients treated for 8 to 12 weeks, candesartan cilexetil had an efficacy rate (reduction of systolic/diastolic blood pressure > or = 20/10 mm Hg and/or mean blood pressure > or = 13 mm Hg) of 72% and 63%, and an adverse effect rate of 9.9% and 7.3%, in patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension and those with impaired renal function, respectively. When data for elderly patients were analysed, there was no difference in efficacy and tolerability compared to non-elderly patients. In a double-blind comparative study, candesartan cilexetil was superior to enalapril in hypertensive patients: efficacy rate, 74% vs 66% (NS); adverse symptom rate, 10.4% vs 27.3% (P < 0.01); incidence of cough, 1.5% vs 14.8% (P < 0.01). Treatment with 2-8 mg of candesartan cilexetil once daily for 8 to 12 weeks reduced the left ventricular mass index without deterioration of cardiac function. In conclusion, 4-12 mg of candesartan cilexetil once daily is effective and well tolerated in patients with essential hypertension, including elderly patients, those with severe hypertension, and hypertensive patients with renal insufficiency. Its improved tolerability profile over angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, as well as its end-organ protective effects, suggest that candesartan cilexetil is useful as a first-line antihypertensive drug.", 
    "265": "The roles of angiotensin (Ang) II as produced by two different enzymes, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and chymase, were investigated in a canine experimental model where intima hyperplasia was induced by balloon catheterization in the common carotid and femoral arteries. The animals received oral candesartan cilexetil (3 mg/kg) or enalapril (10 mg/kg) twice a day for 5 weeks. After 1 week of active drug therapy, the common carotid and femoral arteries were unilaterally injured by balloon catheterization. In the common carotid arteries, both ACE and chymase activities were increased by the injury, with the increase in chymase activities being greater than that in ACE activities. In the femoral arteries, ACE, but not chymase, activities were significantly increased by the injury. Both candesartan cilexetil and enalapril reduced blood pressure almost equally. Enalapril increased plasma renin activity more strongly than did candesartan cilexetil, and significantly decreased vascular and plasma ACE activities. Candesartan cilexetil significantly suppressed the formation of intima hyperplasia in both the carotid and femoral arteries, while enalapril significantly suppressed intima hyperplasia in the femoral, but not in the carotid arteries. These results indicate that local Ang II production by ACE and chymase is involved in the hyperplasia seen in injured intima, and the difference in the inhibitory action of candesartan and enalapril reflects the extent of contribution of each enzyme. The effect of the ACE inhibitor, enalapril, depended on the activity of ACE, whereas that of the Ang II receptor antagonist, candesartan, was independent of ACE activity.", 
    "266": "Current research on angiotensin II AT1-receptor antagonists (AIIRAs) and selected studies presented at the recent symposium held in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, on 6 June 1998, titled 'Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists are NOT all the Same' are reviewed. AIIRAs offer a number of potential advantages over alternative antihypertensive agents acting via the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. They combine blood pressure-lowering effects at least equivalent to those of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, coupled with placebo-like tolerability. Candesartan cilexetil is a novel AIIRA that has demonstrated clinical efficacy superior to losartan, has a sustained duration of action over 24 hours (trough:peak ratio close to 100%) and is well tolerated in patients with essential hypertension. Candesartan cilexetil has a rapid onset of action (approximately 80% of total blood pressure reduction within the first 2 weeks) and dose-dependent effects on blood pressure, is comparable in efficacy to a number of classes of antihypertensives, and is effective in combination therapy (eg, with hydrochlorothiazide and amlodipine). This favourable profile may be due in part to the highly selective, tight binding to and slow dissociation of candesartan from the AT1 receptor. Preliminary studies suggest that candesartan cilexetil also protects end organs (kidney, heart, vasculature, and brain) beyond blood pressure control.", 
    "267": "The individual contributions of, and potential interactions between, the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and the humoral adrenergic stress response to blood pressure regulation were examined in rainbow trout. Intravenous injection of the smooth muscle relaxant, papaverine (10 mg/kg), elicited a transient decrease in dorsal aortic blood pressure (PDA) and systemic vascular resistance (RS), and significant increases in plasma angiotensin II (Ang II) and catecholamine concentrations. Blockade of alpha-adrenoceptors before papaverine treatment prevented PDA and RS recovery, had no effect on the increase in plasma catecholamines, and resulted in greater plasma Ang II concentrations. Administration of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, lisinopril (10(-4) mol/kg), before papaverine treatment attenuated the increases in the plasma concentrations of Ang II, adrenaline, and noradrenaline by 90, 79, and 40%, respectively and also prevented PDA and RS recovery. By itself, lisinopril treatment caused a gradual and sustained decrease in PDA and RS, and reductions in basal plasma Ang II and adrenaline concentrations. Bolus injection of a catecholamine cocktail (4 nmol/kg noradrenaline plus 40 nmol/kg adrenaline) in the lisinopril+papaverine-treated trout, to supplement their circulating catecholamine concentrations and mimic those observed in fish treated only with papaverine, resulted in a temporary recovery in PDA and RS. These results indicate that the RAS and the acute humoral adrenergic response are both recruited during an acute hypotensive stress, and have important roles in the compensatory response to hypotension in rainbow trout. However, whereas the contribution of the RAS to PDA recovery is largely indirect and relies on an Ang II-mediated secretion of catecholamines, the contribution from the adrenergic system is direct and relies at least in part on plasma catecholamines.", 
    "268": "In 30 patients with essential hypertension and 30 healthy control subjects, we evaluated blood concentrations of B cell leukemia-2 (bcl-2), a protooncogene that can reduce apoptosis. Bcl-2 concentrations were higher in hypertensive than in normotensive subjects. The increase in pressure due to a cold pressor test caused a further increase in blood bcl-2 concentrations, in both hypertensive and normotensive subjects. Treatment of hypertensive patients with hypotensive drugs caused a reduction in bcl-2 concentrations, which was more marked after administration of lisinopril than of nifedipine. The results suggest that concentrations of bcl-2 are increased in patients with hypertension, which could be an important factor in cell proliferation underlying posthypertensive vascular remodeling. Moreover, lisinopril and nifedipine appear to be capable of reducing bcl-2 concentrations, with potentially beneficial effects on vascular modifications in patients with hypertension.", 
    "269": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduce the development of atherosclerosis in hypercholesterolemic animals across a wide range of species. Although the mechanism for these effects has not been well delineated, it has been assumed generally that both angiotensin II suppression and interference with the breakdown of bradykinin are involved. To determine whether angiotensin II receptor blockade provides similar effects as those observed with ACE inhibition, we examined the influence of irbesartan, an AT1 receptor antagonist, on aortic atherosclerosis in Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic rabbits using the identical protocol that was employed in our earlier studies involving ACE inhibitors. At a dose of irbesartan (30 mg/kg/day), which was selected because it appeared to block most of the pressor effects of infused angiotensin in rabbits, no effect on atherosclerosis was observed. However, a higher dose of irbesartan (75 mg/kg/day) caused reductions in blood pressure and aortic atherosclerosis similar to those seen in earlier studies with ACE inhibitors. The decrease in aortic intimal surface involvement with irbesartan was from 38.9 +/- 3.8% in controls to 24.1 +/- 3.0% in the treated group (P < .01). Aortic cholesterol content was also significantly reduced in those animals (P < .02). The findings indicate that suppression of the renin-angiotensin system by AT1 receptor blockade in a genetically hypercholesterolemic rabbit model causes comparable inhibition of aortic atherosclerosis as that achieved by ACE inhibition, and that a mild reduction of blood pressure induced by both classes of agents may contribute to their antiatherosclerotic action in this model.",

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of propionyl-L-carnitine on exercise capacity in mild moderate chronic heart failure patients, treated with ACE inhibitors and diuretics.", 
    "271": "This was a phase III, double-blind, randomized, parallel, multicentre study. The primary objective was the evaluation of the effect of propionyl-L-carnitine vs placebo on maximum exercise duration using a bicycle exercise test. The primary analysis performed in the intention-to-treat population (271 and 266 patients in propionyl-L-carnitine and placebo), showed no statistically significant difference between treatments. A difference of 15 s in favour of propionyl-L-carnitine was observed in the completer/complier population (P=0.092). An a priori specified subgroup analysis on patients stratified by baseline maximum exercise duration showed a trend of improvement in propionyl-L-carnitine patients with shorter maximum exercise duration. A non a priori specified analysis in patients stratified by ejection fraction (< or = 30% vs 30-40%), showed a statistically significant difference in maximum exercise duration in favour of propionyl-L-carnitine in those patients with a higher ejection fraction (40 s, P<0.01). There were no safety issues.",

    "273": "Renal failure in multiple myeloma can be precipitated during hemodynamic perturbances of renal blood flow, as seen secondary to volume depletion, radiocontrast dye, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents. We report two cases of acute renal failure that developed suddenly after initiation of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, both with biopsy-proven cast nephropathy. ACE inhibitors may contribute to the intratubular light chain cast formation and acute \"myeloma kidney\" in susceptible patients.", 
    "274": "The effect of the highly lipophilic calcium channel antagonist (CCA) amlodipine on membrane oxyradical damage was examined and compared to that of other CCA analogs and a sulfhydryl-containing ACE inhibitor in isolated membrane vesicles enriched with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Under physiological-like conditions, the dihydropyridine CCA amlodipine significantly (P<0.001) inhibited lipid peroxide formation (>10(2) microM) at concentrations as low as 10.0 nM. Under identical conditions, inhibition of lipid peroxide formation was not observed with representative CCA analogs (felodipine, verapamil, diltiazem) or the ACE inhibitor, captopril, at concentrations as high as 1.0 microM. The potent antioxidant activity of amlodipine is attributed to distinct membrane physico-chemical interactions. High-resolution differential scanning calorimetry showed that amlodipine effected marked changes in membrane thermodynamic properties as compared to other CCA analogs, including a marked reduction in the thermal phase transition temperature (-2.6 degrees C), enthalpy (-4.8 J/g) and cooperative unit size (-59%), relative to control samples. These findings indicate that the chemical structure of amlodipine contributes to distinct membrane biophysical interactions that lead to potent lipid antioxidant effects, independent of calcium channel modulation. These findings provide insights into potential new mechanisms of action for the charged CCA amlodipine.", 
    "275": "Patients with acute myocardial infarction and evidence of heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction during the acute phase have an excessive mortality risk. Therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors attenuates the detrimental effects of angiotensin II and has been shown to substantially reduce morbidity and mortality in this population. Selective, angiotensin type 1 receptor antagonism with losartan, which inhibits the effects of angiotensin II regardless of its source at the receptor level, may provide more complete blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. The Optimal Therapy in Myocardial Infarction with the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan (OPTIMAAL) study is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel, captopril-controlled trial. The primary hypothesis is that, compared with captopril, losartan will decrease the risk for all-cause mortality by 20% in high-risk patients after acute myocardial infarction. The study population will consist of 5,000 patients, > or = 50 years of age, with heart failure during the acute phase or with a new Q-wave anterior infarction or reinfarction. Patients will be randomized to treatment with either losartan or captopril. All patients will be followed until 937 deaths occur (event-driven). The primary end point is total mortality (all-cause mortality). The secondary and tertiary end points are sudden death (and/or resuscitated cardiac death) and fatal/nonfatal reinfarction. Based on the assumed event rate, treatment effect and a 95% power to detect a 20% reduction in all-cause mortality at the 4.3% significance level (2-sided, adjusted for 2 interim analyses), the trial will enroll at least 5,004 patients and continue until a total number of 937 events has been reached (intention-to-treat analysis).",

Whether they also provide benefit to patients with coronary artery disease in the absence of congestive heart failure via an antiatherosclerotic mechanism is a question the QUinapril Ischemic Event Trial quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) study attempted to answer: 1,750 patients with normal left ventricular function who were undergoing coronary angiography and angioplasty were randomized to 20 mg/day of quinapril versus placebo and followed for 3 years for cardiac end points. A randomly selected subgroup of the total cohort underwent follow-up angiography. The primary QCA end point was the categorical designation of progression versus nonprogression, defined either by QCA or by a cardiac event in patients selected for the QCA trial who had no usable follow-up x-ray film. Secondary end points in patients with 2 angiograms were: new stenosis development, change in minimum lumen diameter index, and change in percent diameter stenosis index. There were 119 progressors among 243 placebo-treated patients (49%) and 111 progressors among 234 quinapril-treated patients (47%) (p = NS). There were 44 patients with new stenosis development in the placebo group (19%) and 50 (22%) in the quinapril group (p = NS). Change in minimum lumen diameter index was -0.21+/-0.03 mm in the placebo group and -0.18+/-0.03 mm in the quinapril group (p = NS). Finally, change in percent diameter stenosis index was +5.1+/-1.0 in the placebo group and +3.5+/-1.0 in the quinapril group (p = NS).

Patients were identified using dispensed prescription data. Questionnaires were sent to patients' general practitioners 6 months after the date of first prescription. Cases of cough within the first 60 days of treatment with losartan resulting in withdrawal of the drug were followed up with additional questionnaires. Incidence rates for reports of cough were calculated. In order to reduce the impact of carry-over effects, rate ratios were calculated for first reports of cough between days 8 and 60 using losartan as the index drug.",

Cough was the most frequent reason for discontinuation of losartan and the most frequently reported event in the first month of treatment with this drug. When reports of cough between days 1-7 were excluded, rates of cough were significantly higher for the three ACEIs when compared with losartan (rate ratios 1.5, 4.8 and 5.7, all P<0.03). 101 patients had discontinued losartan due to cough. 91% of these had previously been prescribed an ACEI and 86% had previously experienced ACEI cough.",

    "281": "Effects of ER-40133, an inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), on weight gain and sodium and potassium balance were studied in growing SD male rats. Thirty-two animals (seven weeks of age) were divided into two groups; one received a standard diet containing 0.227% sodium and the other a low (0.065%) sodium diet. They were divided into four subgroups; one control group and three treated groups receiving 3, 10 or 30 mg/kg of ER-40133, by gavage, once a day for five consecutive days. Body weight gain (average of the standard and low sodium diet groups) was -32% in the 3 mg/kg group,-74% in 10 mg/kg group and -99% in 30 mg/kg group, when compared with the control group. There was a highly linear correlation between suppression of body weight gain and reduction in sodium and potassium retention for both groups of animals given the standard and low sodium diet. The reduced sodium retention, the primary effect of ACE inhibitors, accounted for about 30% of suppressed weight gain, and the reduced potassium retention, the secondary effect of sodium deficiency, could account for the rest about 70% of weight suppression by ER-40133.", 
    "282": "The endothelium controls the tone of the underlying vascular smooth muscle mainly through the production of vasodilator mediators. In some cases, this function is hampered by the release of constrictor substances. The endothelial mediators are also involved in the regulation by the endothelium of vascular architecture and the blood cell-vascular wall interactions. The endothelium-derived factors comprise nitric oxide (NO), prostacyclin, and a still unknown endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor(s) (EDHF). In most vascular diseases, the vasodilator function of the endothelium is attenuated. In advanced atherosclerotic lesions, endothelium-dependent vasodilatation may even be abolished. Various degrees and forms of endothelial dysfunction exist, including (1) the impairment of Galphai proteins, (2) less release of NO, prostacyclin and/or EDHF, (3) increased release of endoperoxides, (4) increased production of reactive oxygen species, (5) increased generation of endothelin-1, and (6) decreased sensitivity of the vascular smooth muscle to NO, prostacyclin and/or EDHF. The levels of bradykinin and angiotensin II within the vascular wall are controlled by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). ACE degrades bradykinin and generates angiotensin II. Bradykinin stimulates endothelial cells to release vasodilators. The actions of the kinin are maintained despite endothelial dysfunction, except in very severe arterial lesions. Angiotensin II may be in part responsible for endothelial dysfunction because it induces resistance to the vasodilator action of NO. Thus, impairment of the generation of angiotensin II blocks the direct and indirect vasoconstrictor effect of the peptide. By potentiating bradykinin, ACE inhibitors promote the release of relaxing vasodilator mediators to restore vasodilator function, and to prevent platelet aggregation as well as the recruitment of leukocytes to the vascular wall.", 
    "283": "The vascular endothelium plays a key role in the local regulation of vascular tone by the release of vasodilator substances (i.e. endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF = nitric oxide, NO) and prostacyclin) and vasoconstrictor substances (i.e. thromboxane A2, free radicals, or endothelin). Using either agents like acetylcholine or changes in flow to stimulate the release of EDRF (NO), clinical studies have revealed the importance of EDRF in both basal and stimulated control of vascular tone in large epicardial coronary arteries and in the coronary microcirculation. The regulatory function of the endothelium is altered by cardiovascular risk factors or disorders such as hypercholesterolemia, chronic smoking, hypertension or chronic heart failure. Endothelial dysfunction appears to have detrimental functional consequences as well as adverse longterm effects, including vascular remodelling. Endothelial dysfunction is associated with impaired tissue perfusion particularly during stress and paradoxical vasoconstriction of large conduit vessels including the coronary arteries. These effects may cause or contribute to myocardial ischemia. Several mechanisms may be involved in the development of endothelial dysfunction, such as reduced synthesis and release of EDRF or enhanced inactivation of EDRF after its release from endothelial cells by radicals or oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Increased plasma levels of oxidized LDL have been noted in chronic smokers and are related to the extent endothelial dysfunction, raising the possibility that chronic smoking potentiates endothelial dysfunction by increasing circulating and tissue levels of oxidized LDL. In heart failure, cytokines and/or reduced flow (reflecting reduced shear stress) may be involved in the development of endothelial dysfunction and can be reversed by physical training. Other mechanisms include an activated renin-angiotensin system (i.e. postmyocardial infarction) with increased breakdown of bradykinin by enhanced angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity. There is evidence that endogenous bradykinin is involved in coronary vasomotor control both in coronary conduit and resistance vessels. ACE inhibitors enhance endothelial function by a bradykinin-dependent mechanism and probably also by blunting the generation of superoxide anion. Endothelial dysfunction appears to be reversible by administering L-arginine, the precursor of nitric oxide, lowering cholesterol levels, physical training, antioxidants such as vitamin C, or ACE inhibition.", 
    "284": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition has been shown to improve endothelium-dependent vasodilator responsiveness, but the contribution and mechanism of enhanced nitric oxide (NO) bioactivity to this effect in patients with coronary artery disease are unknown. We investigated the effect of ACE inhibition on brachial artery dilator responsiveness to increased shear stress after forearm ischemia by ultrasonography as a bioassay for endothelial NO available to vascular smooth muscle in 9 men with coronary artery disease. Serum nitrogen oxides were measured after 3 days of nitrate-restricted diet as an index of endothelial NO release. Patients received quinapril 20 to 40 mg/day for 8 weeks. Relative to pretreatment measurements, quinapril increased flow-mediated dilation (from 2.4+/-0.4 to 10.8+/-2.2, p <0.001), with significant improvement persisting 1 week after discontinuation of therapy (6.7+/-2.5%, p <0.01). However, quinapril decreased serum nitrogen oxide levels by 19+/-17% compared with pretreatment values (from 58.2+/-19.0 to 46.0+/-13.3 micromol/L, p <0.01). Thus, ACE inhibitor therapy with quinapril selectively improves endothelium-dependent vasodilator responsiveness by increased NO bioactivity in relation to vascular smooth muscle in patients with coronary artery disease, an effect achieved at a lower rate of NO release from the endothelium. These findings suggest that ACE inhibitors may reduce angiotensin II-induced oxidant stress within the vessel wall and protect NO from oxidative inactivation. This effect may reduce endothelial NO synthesis required for vasomotor regulation.", 
    "285": "Long-term angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition may reduce ischemic events in patients with coronary artery disease, but whether it protects against acute ischemia or the effects of preexisting left ventricular (LV) dysfunction on potential anti-ischemic properties is unknown. We performed a double-blind trial in 25 patients with exercise-induced ischemia. The effects of perindoprilat on pacing-induced myocardial ischemia were examined. Fourteen patients received perindoprilat and 11 patients received placebo. Based on LV function, 2 subgroups were formed in the perindoprilat group: 7 patients with LV dysfunction (LV ejection fraction <0.40), and 7 patients with normal LV function. After receiving the study medication, the pacing test was repeated. During the first pacing test both groups developed ischemia. After perindoprilat administration, the increase in systemic vascular resistance and LV end-diastolic pressure were significantly blunted (p <0.05). Further, the ischemia-induced increase in arterial and cardiac uptake of norepinephrine was inhibited by perindoprilat, and the increase in atrial natriuretic peptide was less pronounced; also, ST-segment depression was reduced by 32% compared with placebo (all p <0.05). In the group with LV dysfunction, perindoprilat reduced LV end-diastolic pressure significantly by 67% and myocardial lactate production was prevented, but this did not happen in the group with normal LV function. In addition, the increase in arterial norepinephrine was reduced by 74% and 33%, respectively (p <0.05). These results indicate that perindoprilat reduced acute, pacing-induced ischemia in normotensive patients. In patients with (asymptomatic) LV dysfunction these effects were more pronounced than in patients with normal LV function.", 
    "286": "Neonatal angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition or angiotensin II type-1 receptor blockade induces irreversible renal histological abnormalities and an impaired urinary concentrating ability in the rat. The aim of the present study was to determine the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the defect in urine concentration in adult rats treated neonatally with enalapril. Male Wistar rats received daily intraperitoneal injections of enalapril (10 mg kg(-1)) or saline vehicle from 3 to 24 days of age. Assessments of fluid handling and maximal urine osmolality (Uosm(max)), renal function and tubular free water reabsorption (T(c)H2O) under pentobarbital anaesthesia, renal tissue solute concentrations, renal aquaporin-2 (AQP2) expression, and kidney histology, were performed in 12-16-week-old rats. Uosm(max) (1488 +/- 109 vs. 2858 +/- 116 mosm kg(-1), P < 0.05) and maximal T(c)H2O were reduced in enalapril- vs. vehicle-treated rats after administration of 1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin. Neonatally enalapril-treated rats showed marked papillary atrophy, a decrease in medullary tissue solute concentrations, and a reduction in AQP2 expression specifically in the inner medulla. Glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow and urinary excretion rates of sodium, potassium and chloride did not differ between groups. In conclusion, adult rats treated neonatally with enalapril showed a urinary concentrating defect of renal origin which primarily could be explained by the papillary atrophy. However, an impaired ability to generate medullary interstitial hypertonicity, and a decrease in inner medullary AQP2 expression, also seem to contribute to this defect.", 
    "287": "Accidental discoveries always played an important role in science, especially in the search for new drugs. Several examples of serendipitous findings, leading to therapeutically useful drugs, are presented and discussed. Captopril, an antihypertensive Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, was the first drug that could be derived from a structural model of a protein. Dorzolamide, a Carboanhydrase inhibitor for the treatment of glaucoma, and the HIV protease inhibitors Saquinavir, Indinavir, Ritonavir, and Nelfinavir are further examples of therapeutically used drugs from structure-based design. More enzyme inhibitors, e.g. the anti-influenza drugs Zanamivir and GS 4104, are in clinical development. In the absence of a protein 3D structure, the 3D structures of certain ligands may be used for rational design. This approach is exemplified by the design of specifically acting integrin receptor antagonists. In the last years, combinatorial and computational approaches became important methods for rational drug design. SAR by NMR searches for low-affinity ligands that bind to proximal subsites of an enzyme; linkage with an appropriate tether produces nanomolar inhibitors. The de novo design program LUDI and the docking program FlexX are tools for the computer-aided design of protein ligands. Work is in progress to combine such approaches to strategies for combinatorial drug design.", 
    "288": "Despite numerous advances in the areas of organ preservation, histocompatibility, and immunosuppression, chronic deterioration of organ allograft function, referred to as \"chronic rejection,\" still remains the main obstacle to long-term graft survival. The common feature of chronic rejection is a concentric generalized graft arteriosclerosis associated with interstitial fibrosis that reflects an allogeneic injury to graft arteries, possibly worsened by other alloantigen-independent risk factors. The presence of the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) gene-deleted (D) allele has been associated, when in homozygosity, with increased risk of cardiovascular diseases and with an accelerated progression of organ damage in a variety of kidney diseases. In this study, we analyzed whether the insertion/deletion polymorphism of the ACE gene, because of its negative prognostic impact on cardiovascular and renal pathology, could have any influence on kidney graft survival in pediatric recipients.", 
    "289": "DNA was isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 146 pediatric dialysis patients (mean age: 12.9 years) who received a first kidney graft at our center between December 1985 and July 1997. To rule out any bias due to acute graft losses, only 119 patients who reached a minimum of 12 months of graft survival were considered for statistical analysis. The insertion/deletion polymorphism of the ACE gene was detected using a polymerase chain reaction technique with two flanking primers.", 
    "290": "The results demonstrated that (i) the distribution of DD and non-DD (ID + II) genotypes was 36.1% (43 patients) and 63.8% (76 patients), respectively; (ii) actuarial graft survival at 7, 8, 9, and 10 years in patients with non-DD genotype was significantly higher than that in patients with DD genotype (7 years: 94.6% vs. 72.4%, P<0.05; 8 years: 94.6% vs. 62%, P<0.025; 9 years: 87.3% vs. 51.4%, P<0.025; 10 years: 76.3% vs. 25.7%, P<0.01).", 
    "291": "In conclusion, the above data indicate that DD genotype is associated in pediatric kidney graft recipients with a shorter long-term kidney graft survival and suggest a possible role of this genotype as a cofactor in the progression of nonimmunological injuries leading to chronic kidney graft failure.", 
    "292": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are increasingly administered to patients with chronic renal disease. One issue of concern with the use of ACE inhibitors in patients with impaired renal function is the possible development of hyperkalemia. We reasoned that the impact of ACE inhibitors on plasma potassium could be minimized by administering these agents at very low doses. To examine this issue, we investigated the effect of a low dose of ramipril (1.25 mg orally once daily) and an eight-fold higher dose (10 mg orally once daily) on plasma potassium in 13 patients with proteinuria and mild chronic renal insufficiency. The study was divided into four phases: placebo (4 weeks), low-dose ramipril (8 weeks), high-dose ramipril (8 weeks), and washout phase (4 weeks). With the low dose of ramipril, urinary protein excretion decreased significantly as early as after 1 week of administration (from 4.4 +/- 0.5 to 3.7 +/- 0.4 g/24 h; P < 0.025) and did not decrease any further thereafter even when the dose was increased eight-fold. Mean arterial blood pressure and plasma potassium did not change significantly with the low dose of ramipril, whereas with the higher dose, mean arterial blood pressure decreased significantly (from 107 +/- 2.0 to 100 +/- 2.0 mm Hg, P < 0.005), and plasma potassium increased significantly (from 4.53 to 4.78 mEq/L, P < 0.05). We conclude that a low dose of ramipril can reduce proteinuria to the same extent as an eight-fold higher dose without significantly lowering blood pressure or increasing plasma potassium. This latter feature may be advantageous for the treatment of patients at risk for hyperkalemia who require ACE inhibitors.", 
    "293": "Protein trafficking across the glomerular capillary has a pathogenic role in subsequent renal damage. Despite evidence that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors improve glomerular size-selectivity, whether this effect is solely due to ANG II blocking or if other mediators also play a contributory role is not clear yet. We studied 20 proteinuric patients with IgA nephropathy, who received either enalapril (20 mg/day) or the ANG II receptor blocker irbesartan (100 mg/day) for 28 days in a randomized double-blind study. Measurements of blood pressure, renal hemodynamics, and fractional clearance of neutral dextran of graded sizes were performed before and after 28 days of treatment. Both enalapril and irbesartan significantly reduced blood pressure over baseline. This reduction reached the maximum effect 4-6 h after drug administration but did not last for the entire 24-h period. Despite transient antihypertensive effect, proteinuria was effectively reduced by both treatments to comparable extents. Neither enalapril nor irbesartan modified the sieving coefficients of small dextran molecules, but both effectively reduced transglomerular passage of large test macromolecules. Theoretical analysis of sieving coefficients showed that neither drug affected significantly the mean pore radius or the spread of the pore-size distribution, but both importantly and comparably reduced the importance of a nonselective shunt pathway. These data suggest that antagonism of ANG II is the key mechanism by which ACE inhibitors exert their beneficial effect on glomerular size-selective function and consequently on glomerular filtration and urinary output of plasma proteins.", 
    "294": "Exogenous endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a strong vasoconstrictor in the canine kidney and causes a decrease in renal blood flow (RBF) by stimulating the ETA receptor subtype. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of endogenously generated ET-1 in renal hemodynamics under physiological conditions. In six conscious foxhounds, the time course of the effects of the selective ETA receptor antagonist LU-135252 (10 mg/kg iv) on mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), RBF, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR), as well as its effects on renal autoregulation, were examined. LU-135252 increased RBF by 20% (from 270 +/- 21 to 323 +/- 41 ml/min, P < 0.05) and HR from 76 +/- 5 to 97 +/- 8 beats/min (P < 0. 05), but did not alter MAP, GFR, or autoregulation of RBF and GFR. Since a number of interactions between ET-1 and the renin-angiotensin system have been reported previously, experiments were repeated during angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition by trandolaprilat (2 mg/kg iv). When ETA receptor blockade was combined with ACE inhibition, which by itself had no effects on renal hemodynamics, marked changes were observed: MAP decreased from 91 +/- 4 to 80 +/- 5 mmHg (P < 0.05), HR increased from 85 +/- 5 to 102 +/- 11 beats/min (P < 0.05), and RBF increased from 278 +/- 23 to 412 +/- 45 ml/min (P < 0.05). Despite a pronounced decrease in renal vascular resistance over the entire pressure range investigated (40-100 mmHg), the capacity of the kidneys to autoregulate RBF was not impaired. The GFR remained completely unaffected at all pressure levels. These results demonstrate that endogenously generated ET-1 contributes significantly to renal vascular tone but does not interfere with the mechanisms of renal autoregulation. If ETA receptors are blocked, then the vasoconstrictor effects of ET-1 in the kidney are compensated for to a large extent by an augmented influence of ANG II. Thus ET-1 and ANG II appear to constitute a major interrelated vasoconstrictor system in the control of RBF.", 
    "295": "The role of endothelin (ET)-1 in blood pressure homeostasis and the interaction with the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) was investigated in normotensive conscious dogs. ETA receptors were blocked by LU-135252 (1-30 mg/kg); trandolapril (2 mg/kg) or losartan (10 mg/kg) was used to inhibit the RAS. LU-135252 in oral doses of 3-30 mg/kg significantly reduced mean arterial pressure (MAP) by approximately 10 mmHg maximally, whereas trandolapril or losartan were without any effect. MAP reduction was more pronounced when LU-135252 was combined with either losartan (-15.5 +/- 3.2 mmHg; 2 h postadministration; P < 0.05) or trandolapril (-30.9 +/- 3.6 mmHg; P < 0.05). When endogenous nitric oxide (NO) generation was blocked but NO concomitantly infused, this synergistic effect on MAP was prevented. The data show that ET-1 contributes to the maintenance of blood pressure via ETA receptors. Furthermore, ET-1 and ANG II play a prominent role in the control of blood pressure by opposing the effects of NO. The pronounced blood pressure fall after combined blockade of ETA receptors and the RAS may be mediated by an enhanced release of NO.", 
    "296": "Approximately 80% of all patients with diabetes die of cardiovascular disease. The traditional management of type 2 diabetes has been ineffective in altering this dismal prognosis. Insulin resistance is the fundamental defect of type 2 diabetes. Insulin resistance often leads to hyperinsulinemia, which is associated with hypertension, atherogenic dyslipidemia, left ventricular hypertrophy, impaired fibrinolysis, visceral obesity, and sedentary lifestyle. Although all these conditions are associated with atherosclerosis and adverse cardiovascular events, the therapeutic efforts in patients with diabetes have focused predominantly on normalizing glucose levels. Improved insulin sensitivity through lifestyle modifications or pharmacologic therapy (troglitazone and metformin) will lower both insulin and glucose levels as well as diminish dyslipidemia and hypertension. In contrast, sulfonylurea agents lower glucose by increasing insulin levels and may increase the risk of cardiovascular events. Therapy including aspirin, lipid agents (for example, statins), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-adrenergic blockers, postmenopausal estrogen replacement, and vitamin E should be considered for patients with type 2 diabetes. In most patients with diabetes who have multivessel coronary artery disease, coronary artery bypass grafting is superior to coronary angioplasty for improving long-term cardiovascular prognosis. This superiority is mediated in part by the use of a left internal mammary graft to the left anterior descending coronary artery. Urgent coronary angioplasty or thrombolytic therapy should be considered for all patients with diabetes who have acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "297": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have proven an effective means to control hypertension and manage cardiac hypertrophy. It is presently unknown if newer specific angiotensin II subtype 1 receptor (AT1R) antagonists are as effective or more effective in treating these conditions compared with ACE inhibitors. There is evidence that these classes of drugs may affect cardiac hypertrophy by different mechanisms. This study compared the effect of irbesartan, an AT1R antagonist, with that of captopril, an ACE inhibitor, on expression of early genetic markers of cardiac hypertrophy in lean male SHHF/Mcc-fa(cp) rats. SHHF/Mcc-fa(cp) rats (n = 10/group) were given captopril (100 mg/kg/day), irbesartan (50 mg/kg/day), or placebo for 16 weeks. Irbesartan and captopril significantly reduced systolic pressure and produced similar rightward shifts in the angiotensin I dose-response curve. Renal renin gene expression was increased 8.6-fold by irbesartan and 17.7-fold by captopril. The only effect on echocardiographic findings was a similar decrease in aortic peak velocity, an index of systolic function, by both treatments. Early markers of cardiac hypertrophy were significantly attenuated by both drugs. Both drugs produced marked and equivalent reductions in left ventricular atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) messenger RNA (mRNA) levels compared with controls. This decrease in ANP gene expression was accompanied by a decrease in plasma ANP concentration in the treatment groups. The shift from V1 to V3 myosin isozymes was similarly decreased in both treatment groups, compared with controls. These data suggest that captopril and irbesartan are similarly effective in controlling expression of genes associated with ventricular hypertrophy in heart failure-prone SHHF/Mcc-fa(cp) rat.",

The average EPO dose and weight loss during dialysis was correlated with BP. To better understand the extent of HTN, systolic and diastolic pressures were separately graded from 0 to 3 and a number designated as hypertension sensitivity index (HSI) was assigned to each patient.", 
    "300": "Of the 190 patients, 146 (76.8%) were hypertensive. 117 out of 146 hypertensive patients (80.1%) had persistent elevation of BP despite being on one or more antihypertensive medications. Most patients were on calcium channel blockers (39%) with 27% being on beta-blockers and 14% on Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. There was no correlation between the number of medications used and the control of HTN. The dose of EPO also had no effect on the degree of HTN. 69.8% of all HTN was systolic. Of this, 64.7% was pre-dialysis and 35.3% post-dialysis. Multiple regression analysis demonstrated a significant correlation with loss of weight during dialysis and lowering of systolic BP (r = 0.33, p = 0.0001). The mean HSI for this population was 2.3+/-1.8.", 
    "301": "HTN was a frequent finding in our hemodialysis population and it was controlled in only 19.9% of hypertensive patients. Most of this HTN was pre-dialysis systolic. There was a significant correlation between fluid loss during dialysis and lowering of blood pressure. The use of the HSI has proven to be helpful in differentiating type and severity of HTN.", 
    "302": "Because S-perindopril enantiomer is the eutomer which is responsible for the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition activity, it is necessary to develop a reliable method for its assay from its distomer, the R-enantiomer. For this purpose, an amperometric biosensor was developed based on L-amino acid oxidase. The working range of the described biosensor was 20pmol/L-10 micromol/L on the 7.0-7.4 pH range, with a detection limit of 2pmol/L. The low enantioselectivity for R-perindopril, as compared with S-enantiomer, was demonstrated by both mixed solutions and separate solutions methods (amperometric selectivity coefficient is 1.0 x 10(-4)). The biosensor was also selective towards D-proline and polyvinylpyrrolidone. The amperometric biosensor can be used for enantioselective analysis of S-perindopril in raw material, with an RSD < 1%. The life time (t95%) of the biosensor is three weeks.",

This review summarizes how such interactions may be used in analytical (bio-)chemistry, e.g., for the elucidation of the binding mechanism, the determination of the binding strength, the carting of the binding site, or the screening of possible substrate/inhibitor molecules. Possible assay formats such as analytical affinity chromatography, affinity capillary electrophoresis (ACE), conventional affinity gel electrophoresis (AEP), and related techniques are discussed together with examples of recent applications. In addition a brief section on enzyme-substrate reactions as tools in analytical chemistry is included, since these are perhaps even more important to analytical (bio-)chemistry. The development and application of bioanalytical systems and especially biosensors in various fields including medicine, biotechnology, agriculture, defense and foodstuffs are considered.",

The telmisartan dosage was increased from 20 to 40-80 mg and that of enalapril from 5 to 10-20 mg at 4-week intervals until trough supine diastolic blood pressure was < 90 mmHg. After 12 weeks, hydrochlorothiazide at 12.5-25 mg once a day was added to the treatment regimen of those patients not controlled on monotherapy.", 
    "307": "Both treatments lowered blood pressure in a comparable and clinically meaningful manner. The adjusted mean changes from baseline in supine diastolic blood pressure at trough were -12.8 mmHg for telmisartan and -11.4 mmHg for enalapril (P = 0.074). Mean changes in supine systolic blood pressure were -22.1 mmHg for telmisartan and -20.1 mmHg for enalapril (P = 0.350). Overall, 63 and 62% of patients responded to telmisartan and enalapril, respectively, with a supine diastolic blood pressure of < 90 mmHg. Both regimens provided effective blood pressure lowering over the 24 h dosing interval, as determined by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Both regimens were well tolerated; however, patients on the enalapril regimen had more than double the incidence of treatment-related cough compared with those on the telmisartan regimen (16 versus 6.5%).",

Systolic blood pressure was estimated by a tail-cuff plethysmograph. Relaxing responses to acetylcholine (10(-12) to 10(-8) mol) in mesenteric vascular beds precontracted with phenylephrine (10(-5) mol/l) were studied in the presence and absence of L-NAME (10(-5) mol/l), L-NAME + indomethacin (10(-5) mol/l) or L-NAME + indomethacin + potassium chloride (6 x 10(-5) mol/l). The area under the dose- response curve was used to calculate the approximate participation of nitric oxide, prostaglandins or endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor in the acetylcholine-induced relaxation.", 
    "311": "Chronic administration of L-NAME increased blood pressure levels and vascular responsiveness to phenylephrine. Treatments with either quinapril or diltiazem reduced blood pressure levels and attenuated the increased response to phenylephrine. Relaxing responses to acetylcholine were similar in all groups, independently of the treatment received. The calculated participation of endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor in the acetylcholine-induced relaxation was higher than that of nitric oxide and prostaglandins in all groups, but was higher in L-NAME-treated than in untreated rats. In contrast, the participation of both nitric oxide and prostaglandins was higher in control than in L-NAME-treated rats. Quinapril increased the participation of prostaglandins in L-NAME-treated rats. Diltiazem increased the participation of nitric oxide in L-NAME-treated rats.", 
    "312": "The administration of L-NAME in Sprague-Dawley rats increased the production of endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor as a compensatory mechanism to maintain acetylcholine-induced relaxation. Antihypertensive therapy with either quinapril or diltiazem produced a selective redistribution of the endothelial factors mediating acetylcholine-induced relaxation.", 
    "313": "Approximately 150 million people worldwide have diabetes mellitus, of whom 90% are type II diabetics. It is therefore of no surprise that diabetic nephropathy has become the leading cause of end-stage renal disease. Opposite to what has been known previously, kidney disease is at least as common in type II as in type I diabetes. However, because the majority of type II diabetics has hypertension for many years before diabetes mellitus becomes clinically relevant, renal lesions are often heterogeneous with frequent exclusive presence of ischemic changes. For the treatment of hypertension in diabetics without nephropathy (no microalbuminuria), drugs that exert beneficial effects or are at least neutral with respect to lipid and glucose metabolism, such as ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II-receptor antagonists, non-dihydropyridine-calcium channel blockers and the thiazide-like indapamide, are to be preferred. Although metabolically neutral, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers should be used with caution, since an increase in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in type II diabetics treated with these compounds has most recently been described. Once that diabetic nephropathy is established, blood pressure should be lowered to 120/80 mmHg (measured in seated position). Antihypertensive treatment should primarily be based on ACE inhibitors; angiotensin II-receptor antagonists are a valuable alternative if ACE inhibitors are not tolerated. Both ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II-receptor antagonists should be used with high caution in elderly patients with severe atherosclerosis in whom acute renal failure could occur due to the presence of bilateral renal artery stenosis. Newer studies indicate that non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers such as verapamil and diltiazem may be as effective as ACE inhibitors in preserving renal function in diabetic nephropathy. A fix-dose combination of the ACE inhibitor trandolapril with verapamil is now available; it should be reserved for patients whose blood pressure and/or proteinuria can not be adequately controlled with ACE inhibitors. Finally, indapamide is the only antihypertensive diuretic with nephroprotective properties.", 
    "314": "1. We have measured arterial blood pressure between 115 and 145 days gestation in normally grown fetal sheep (control group; n = 16) and in fetal sheep in which growth was restricted by experimental restriction of placental growth and development (PR group; n = 13). There was no significant difference in the mean gestational arterial blood pressure between the PR (42.7 +/- 2.6 mmHg) and control groups (37.7 +/- 2.3 mmHg). Mean arterial blood pressure and arterial PO2 were significantly correlated in control animals (r = 0.53, P < 0.05, n = 16), but not in the PR group. 2. There were no changes in mean arterial blood pressure in either the PR or control groups in response to captopril (7.5 microg captopril min-1; PR group n = 7, control group n = 6) between 115 and 125 days gestation. After 135 days gestation, there was a significant decrease (P < 0.05) in the fetal arterial blood pressure in the PR group but not in the control group during the captopril infusion (15 microg captopril min-1; PR group n = 7, control group n = 6). 3. There was a significant effect (F = 14.75; P < 0.001) of increasing doses of angiotensin II on fetal diastolic blood pressure in the PR and control groups. The effects of angiotensin II were different (F = 8.67; P < 0.05) in the PR and control groups at both gestational age ranges. 4. These data indicate that arterial blood pressure may be maintained by different mechanisms in growth restricted fetuses and normally grown counterparts and suggests a role for the fetal renin-angiotensin system in the maintenance of blood pressure in growth restricted fetuses.", 
    "315": "Prednisone monotherapy is the treatment of choice for patients with a nephrotic syndrome due to minimal change glomerulopathy. In adult patients treatment should be continued for at least 24 weeks. Within this period a remission of proteinuria will occur in 75 to 90% of the patients. Patients who do not respond satisfactorily to prednisone treatment can be treated with alkylating agents. Cyclophosphamide is the drug used most commonly. Prolonged treatment (> 12 weeks) is associated with a high risk of infertility. If alkylating agents cannot be used, prolonged treatment with ciclosporine is an option.", 
    "316": "The European Society of Cardiology, the European Atherosclerosis Society and the European Society of Hypertension published in 1994 a joint statement and recommendation on prevention of coronary heart disease in clinical practice. The EUROASPIRE study intended to investigate the present clinical practice in this respect in 9 European countries. The present paper deals with the Hungarian leg of the collaborative study. Hospital data of 546 patients below the age of 70 were reviewed of whom 29% were women. Consecutive patients were identified retrospectively with the following discharge-diagnoses: coronary bypass grafting, PTCA, acute myocardial infarction and angina pectoris. Minimum 6, in the average 18 month after the index event, patients were interviewed and examined. The participation rate was 77%. During the index hospitalisation an incomplete documentation of the main risk factors was found: blood pressure values were missing in 12%, lipid values in 48%, smoking status in 34%, body weight in 22% and family history in 46% of the cases, with wide variation between diagnostic categories. At follow-up 23% of the patients were obese (BMI > or = 30 kg/m2), 49% had elevated blood pressure (140/90 > or = Hgmm), 46% had total cholesterol above 5.5 mmol/l, 23% smoked and 27% were diabetic. 75% of the patients were on antiplatelet, 14% on anticoagulant, 58% on beta-blocking, 22% on lipid lowering, 32% on ACE-inhibitor and 44% on calcium channel blocking medication. The screening of first degree relatives was recommended in only 18% of the patients. The results speak for a substantial neglect of secondary prevention of coronary patients in the Hungarian clinical practice. However without complex detection, evaluation and management of risk factors it is impossible to reduce the recurrence and high mortality of coronary heart disease.", 
    "317": "Mediators responsible for renal changes in obstructive jaundice are not specified. This study is designed to study the role of endothelin-1 (ET-1) in obstructive jaundice in rats. Animals were randomly placed into five experimental groups. Group 1 (N = 3) was the sham-operated group. Group 2 (N = 8) after common bile duct (CBD) ligation, received bosentan, which is a nonselective endothelin receptor blocker, 50 mg/kg/day for seven days. Group 3 (N = 7) received 1 microg/kg/day captopril. Group 4 (N = 7) was given both drugs orally for seven days. Group 5 (N = 6) after CBD ligation, received Arabic gum as the vehicle. Blood was drawn from the infrahepatic vena cava for the determination of ET-1, bilirubin, creatinine, protein oxidation products, hyaluronic acid, and beta-N-acetyl-hexosaminase. Liver tissue samples were obtained to determine glutathione levels. ET-1, protein oxidation products, hyaluronic acid, bilirubin, and creatinine levels increased significantly in the control group when compared with sham. Bosentan effectively prevented ET-1 elevation but could not reverse creatinine or bilirubin elevation. Captopril with or without bosentan was cytoprotective but did not reverse increased creatinine levels. It is concluded that increased ET-1 in obstructive jaundice may be one of the contributing factors of renal damage.", 
    "318": "To assess the efficacy and safety of bisoprolol/6.25-mg hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), amlodipine, and enalapril in black and nonblack patients, data from two comparative studies were pooled and subgroup analyses performed. Both studies had similar designs and included all three active treatments. The second study also included a placebo group. Subjects (n = 541) with a sitting diastolic blood pressure of 95-114 mmHg were titrated to achieve a diastolic blood pressure < or = 90 mmHg. The studies included 114 blacks and 427 nonblacks. Results of an intention-to-treat analysis of mean change from baseline after 12 weeks of treatment showed the following: 1) blood pressure was significantly lowered by all three active drugs compared with baseline or placebo; 2) in blacks, bisoprolol/6.25-mg HCTZ resulted in significantly greater reductions of systolic and diastolic blood pressure than enalapril or placebo, but was not significantly different from amlodipine; 3) in nonblacks, bisoprolol/6.25-mg HCTZ resulted in significantly greater reduction of diastolic blood pressure than amlodipine, enalapril, or placebo. The placebo-corrected change in blood pressure was greater for blacks than whites on the bisoprolol/6.25-mg HCTZ combination, but this was not statistically significant. Bisoprolol/6.25-mg HCTZ controlled diastolic blood pressure to < or = 90 mmHg in significantly more patients than enalapril or placebo in blacks and nonblacks. The difference in control rates was not significant versus amlodipine. The incidence of drug-related adverse events was similar between treatments; however, bisoprolol/6.25-mg HCTZ had a lower discontinuation rate due to lack of blood pressure control or adverse experiences in both blacks and nonblacks.",

Of 1,141 physicians who responded to the survey, 1,018 were eligible for analysis. Eighty-six percent of physicians reported screening more than half of their patients with type 1 diabetes for overt albuminuria, as did 82% of physicians for their patients with type 2 diabetes. Only 17% of physicians indicated performing microalbuminuria testing on more than half of their type 1 patients. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor agents were used frequently to treat abnormal urinary albumin excretion when hypertension was present, but less often when hypertension was absent. Physician specialty, year of graduation from medical school, practice location, and familiarity with the results of the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial were significant predictors of screening and treatment practice patterns.", 
    "324": "Primary care physicians report practices that allow them to detect overt albuminuria but not microalbuminuria. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are frequently used by physicians who test for microalbuminuria, but efforts to increase the detection of early renal damage are needed so that these agents and other therapeutic strategies may be employed at the earliest opportunity.", 
    "325": "Estrogen deficiency, hyperinsulinemia, type II diabetes, atherosclerosis, and a past history of elevated blood pressure may be associated with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Common to all of these risk factors is a diminished capacity of vascular endothelium to generate nitric oxide (NO). Vascular NO has the potential to enhance the membrane polarization of cerebral neurons by increasing the open probability of calcium-activated potassium channels; this may protect neurons from the excessive calcium influx, potentiated by beta-amyloid peptides that is thought to mediate neuronal damage in AD. The possibility that NO/cyclic guanosine 3', 5'-phosphate (cGMP) may modulate the synthesis or processing of the amyloid precursor protein, also merits evaluation. Practical measures for promoting vascular NO production may include increased intakes of arginine, potassium, antioxidants, and fish-oil, as well as lifestyle measures that typically lower elevated blood pressure; potential benefits of chromium, glucosamine, and silicon should also be explored. In hypertensives, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and sodium restriction may favorably influence endothelial function. Fish-oil should have the additional benefit of antagonizing the contribution of interleukin-1 to AD pathogenesis. Ancillary anti-excitotoxic measures such as magnesium, taurine, phenytoin, and vasodilators targeting ATP-dependent potassium (KATP) channels, may likewise reduce AD risk. Most of the nutritional measures suggested here would in any case be recommendable for preservation of vascular health.", 
    "326": "Both hypertension and diabetes mellitus are multifaceted dynamic expressions of pathophysiological disequilibrium that are closely related with and even intermingled by a number of common factors. Hyperinsulinaemia and insulin resistance may be possible links between hypertension and diabetes mellitus. While working on the effect of different antihypertensive agents in several animal models of simultaneously occurring diabetes-mellitus and hypertension it was found that most antihypertensives prevented streptozotocin (STZ)-induced hypertension in rats. Hydralazine, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium channel blockers (CCB) and clonidine prevented STZ-induced cardiomyopathy, hyperlipidaemia and glucose tolerance. It was further demonstrated that atenolol produced many unfavourable effects like hyperlipidaemia and decreased cardiac functions. We also used other animal models of simultaneously occurring diabetes-mellitus and hypertension such as genetically hypertensive or spontaneously hypertensive (SH), Deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-hypertensive and neonatal streptozotocin-induced NIDDM rats. Results of our studies suggest that SH, neonatal STZ-induced NIDDM, and fructose hypertensive rat models may be considered as models for insulin resistance - the concept that has come into limelight in recent years. DOCA may have some influence on glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity and some sort of counteraction to STZ-induced cardiovascular and metabolic changes occur with DOCA. Hence, it may not be considered as an ideal model to study the metabolic and cardiovascular complications of hypertension associated with diabetes-mellitus. Among ACE inhibitors, perindopril, spirapril, and among calcium channel blockers (CCB) used in our study amlodipine and nifedipine were found to produce an increase in insulin sensitivity. Enalapril, ramipril, lisinopril and nitrendipine failed to alter insulin sensitivity as far as the glycaemic control is concerned. Extension of the results of these experiments to the clinical practice substantiated many of the findings and a good correlation between results obtained from experimental studies and clinical data was found.", 
    "327": "In view of the activation of renin-angiotensin system under conditions associated with pressure overload on the heart, we examined the effects of captopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, and losartan, an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, on cardiac function, myofibrillar ATPase and sarcoplasmic reticular (SR) Ca2+-pump (SERCA2) activities, as well as myosin and SERCA2 gene expression in hypertrophied hearts. Cardiac hypertrophy was induced in rats treated with or without captopril or losartan by banding the abdominal aorta for 8 weeks; sham operated animals served as control. Decrease in left ventricular developed pressure, +dP/dt and -dP/dt as well as increase in left ventricular end diastolic pressure and increased muscle mass due to pressure overload were prevented by captopril or losartan. Treatment of animals with captopril or losartan also attenuated the pressure overload-induced depression in myofibrillar Ca2+-stimulated ATPase, myosin ATPase, SR Ca2+-uptake and SR Ca2+-release activities. An increase in beta-myosin heavy chain mRNA and a decrease in alpha-myosin heavy chain mRNA as well as depressed SERCA2 protein and SERCA2 mRNA levels were prevented by captopril or losartan. These results suggest that both captopril and losartan improve myocardial function in cardiac hypertrophy by preventing changes in gene expression and subsequent subcellular remodeling due to pressure overload.", 
    "328": "A number of new classes of antihypertensive drugs have become available in the recent years which appear to hold therapeutic potential for better management of hypertension. Losartan, an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, does not produce cough which is classically seen with ACE inhibitors. Fenoldopam, a dopamine D1-receptor agonist, has a rapid and short duration of action and is ideally suited by intravenous infusion for quick control of BP in hypertensive emergencies. Kentaserin, a serotonin (5-HT2A) receptor antagonist, has a long duration of action and can be given once daily. It has the added benefit of having antiplatelet effect. Monatepil, a dual alpha-receptor and calcium channel blocker, has potent antihypertensive effect, lowers serum cholesterol and also has antiatherosclerotic effect. Dual ACE and endopeptidase inhibitor, such as alatriopril, has a \"broad spectrum\" antihypertensive effect and may be effective in majority of hypertensive patients. Many other classes of antihypertensive drugs are still in the investigative stage, and their therapeutic potentials and safety need to be ascertained in long-term controlled clinical trials.",

A MEDLINE search of past 10 years data on various experimental studies, controlled clinical trials, meta-analysis and editorials pertaining to nephroprotection in diabetes mellitus was made. Effect of various therapeutic interventions such as metabolic glycaemic control, restricted protein diet and antihypertensive drugs (especially ACE inhibitors) has been analysed on the progression of different stages of kidney involvement in diabetes mellitus such as normoalbuminuria, microalbuminuria, diabetic nephropathy and end stage renal disease (ESRD). An attempt has been made to analyse differential long-term impact of various therapeutic interventions in relation to type of diabetes mellitus (i.e., IDDM and NIDDM) and associated hypertension. Progression of IDDM patients having microalbuminuria or diabetic nephropathy with or without hypertension has improved during the past decade largely because of adequate glycaemic control and effective antihypertensive treatment with conventional drugs e.g. beta-blockers and calcium antagonists, and more so due to the use of ACE inhibitors e.g. captopril, enalapril etc. Superiority of ACE inhibitor tends to decline from normotensive stage to the degree of rise in systemic blood pressure. However, data in NIDDM patients suffering from diabetic nephropathy is incomplete and inconclusive.",

The present work was undertaken to study the effects of enalapril and nifedipine on insulin sensitivity in spontaneously hypertensive (SH) rats and diabetic rats. Insulin sensitivity was measured by insulin tolerance test using K(ITT) as an index of insulin mediated glucose metabolism. The time to produce 50% fall in initial blood sugar level (T1/2) was significantly higher in non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and SH rats as compared to Wistar control. The mean K(ITT) values were significantly lower in NIDDM and SH rats as compared to Wistar control. Treatment with nifedipine (10 mg/kg) and enalapril (5 mg/kg) for 15 days produced a significant reduction in T1/2. Further, K(ITT) value was found to be significantly increased in SH rats treated with nifedipine or enalapril as compared to control. Our data indicate that NIDDM and SH rats are not only hyperinsulinemic but also insulin resistant. Nifedipine and enalapril treatment produced increase in insulin sensitivity in these animals.",

Verapamil showed no significant effects on renal haemodynamics. Trandolapril and vera/tran did not significantly change GFR, but ERPF increased and FF decreased during both treatments (P<0.05). The antiproteinuric response of verapamil was significantly less compared to that of trandolapril and vera/tran (-12% (-17/-1) vs -51% (-56/-25) and -41% (-50/-19) respectively). The blood pressure and antiproteinuric response during verapamil tended to be greater in hypertensive patients than in normotensive patients, although this difference was not significant. Baseline blood pressure was related to the change in blood pressure during verapamil (r = -0.70; P < 0.02).", 
    "338": "The antiproteinuric and antihypertensive response of verapamil is less than that of the ACE inhibitor trandolapril in patients with non-diabetic renal disease. In contrast to the antiproteinuric response of trandolapril, the antiproteinuric reponse of verapamil seems to be completely dependent from effective blood pressure reduction.

By analysing the excretion of proteins with different charge and weight (albumin, transferrin, IgG, IgG4 and beta2-microglobulin) it became apparent that the increase of proteinuria was the result of a change in size selectivity rather than a change in glomerular charge selectivity or tubular protein reabsorption. Glomerular filtration rate rose from 83+/-34 ml to 95+/-43 ml/min (P<0.001) after 5 h, whereas effective renal plasma flow and endogenous creatinine clearance remained unchanged. As a result filtration fraction was increased, compatible with an increased glomerular pressure, which probably contributes to the size selectivity changes. Since corticosteroids affect both the renin-angiotensin system and renal prostaglandins, we have evaluated the effects of prednisolone on proteinuria after pretreatment with 3 months of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril or after 2 weeks of the prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor indomethacin. Neither drug had any effect on prednisolone-induced increases of proteinuria.",

There was no significant difference between the mean day-time and night-time BP in hypertensive patients (125+/-9/82+/-7 mmHg vs 128+/-10/85+/-9 mmHg). The circadian variation of BP was preserved ('dippers') in 82% of the normotensive and 7% of the hypertensive patients (P<0.001). There were 10 'white-coat hypertensives' among the patients classified as normotensives with ABPM (mean office blood pressure 149+/-7/96+/-8 mmHg, 24-h blood pressure 127+/-6/83+/-5 mmHg, P<0.05) and 14 among treated hypertensives (mean office BP 152+/-8/98+/-6 mmHg, 24-h BP 130+/-4/85+/-8 mmHg, P<0.05).

    "347": "At the present time we cannot assume that the proven benefits of ACEI on renal disease will be reproduced by using AT1-ra. With potentially differing modes of activity of these drugs, they cannot be seen as interchangeable and ACEI should remain the drug of choice in patients with progressive renal disease unless they are not tolerated. It is possible that AT1-ra may offer additional advantages in some patients or that synergy exists between the two agents, but this view will remain entirely speculative unless proper trials are conducted. Despite the results of the ELITE study [22], the uncertainty regarding the use AT1-ra in cardiovascular disease mirrors that of renal disease. This issue is obviously of relevance to the nephrologist in view of the spectrum of cardiac disease that accompanies chronic renal failure, such as left ventricular hypertrophy and cardiac failure, which provide multiple indications for manipulation of RAS. Despite their renoprotective effect, previous studies on ACEI [3,4] have not shown an overall reduction in mortality and this issue needs to be addressed in addition to renoprotection in studies comparing AT1-ra and ACEI.",

Ten dogs were randomly assigned to 2 groups of 5 animals in a 2-period crossover design for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor administration. Renal failure was surgically induced by right nephrectomy and electrocoagulation of the remaining kidney. Renal mass reduction induced a significant decrease (P < .001) in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (1.7 +/- 0.3 versus 3.3 +/- 0.7 mL/kg/minute). No significant differences before and after surgery were observed for enalapril and benazepril kinetics. The area under the curve (AUC) for enalaprilat increased after surgery from 23.6 +/- 14.7 to 42.4 +/- 20.9 micrograms.minute/mL (P < .01). Mean peak plasma concentration (Cmax) was increased in the impaired dogs (59.1 +/- 23.3 versus 43.9 +/- 32.9 ng/mL), but this variation was not significant (P > .05). Renal failure had no significant effect on AUC for benazeprilat (13.8 +/- 9.8 versus 14.9 +/- 5.0 micrograms.minute/mL) (P > .05), but Cmax decreased significantly (from 55.0 +/- 26.4 to 31.9 +/- 17.7 ng/mL) (P < .05). Multiple regression analysis showed that both GFR and AUC for enalapril were highly significant variables that explained the variation in AUC for enalaprilat (R2 = .86, P < .001) but not for benazeprilat (R2 = .12, P > .05).

    "349": "Effect of lisinopril on progression of retinopathy and microalbuminuria in normotensive subjects with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Retinopathy and nephropathy are the most important microvascular complications in diabetes with hyperglycaemia and hypertension as important risk factors. Antihypertensive treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors has been shown to delay progression of nephropathy, but the effect on retinopathy has not been established. We, therefore, performed a trial of the effect of the ACE-inhibitor lisinopril on retinopathy and nephropathy in normotensive patients with IDDM. We performed a two year randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of the ACE-inhibitor lisinopril on 530 normotensive IDDM patients within the age group 20-59 years from 18 European centres. Patients were either normo- or microalbuminuric. Retinopathy was classified from retinal photographs into five levels (none to proliferative). The primary endpoint of the trial was progression of albuminuria. Mean albumin excretion rate (AER) was 8.0 micrograms/min at baseline in both treatment groups. After two years AER was 2.2. micrograms/min lower in the lisinopril than in the placebo group, a difference of 18.8% (p = 0.03). The difference in AER was 38.5 micrograms/min between treatment groups in patients with microalbuminuria at baseline (p = 0.001), and 0.23 microgram/min in patients with normoalbuminuria at baseline (p = 0.6). Retinopathy was a secondary endpoint. Patients treated with lisinopril had significantly lower Hb-A1c at baseline than the placebo group (6.9%-7.3%). Retinopathy progressed with at least one level in 13.2% of lisinopril treated and 23.4% of placebo treated patients (odds ratio 0.50, p = 0.02). Progression by two levels or progression to proliferative retinopathy were also significantly reduced in the lisinopril group compared to the placebo group (odds ratio 0.27 and 0.18, respectively). In conclusion, lisinopril delays progression of retinopathy and nephropathy in normotensive IDDM patients with micro- or normoalbuminuria.",

Subcutaneous injection of sodium deoxycholic acid into the anterior of the back of male ddY mice elicited dose-dependent scratching of the injected site with the forepaws and hindpaws. 2. Up to 100 microg of sodium deoxycholic acid induced no significant increase in vascular permeability at the injection site as assessed by a dye leakage method. 3. Bradykinin (BK) B2 receptor antagonists, FR173657 and Hoe140, significantly decreased the frequency of scratching induced by sodium deoxycholic acid. 4. Treatment with aprotinin to inhibit tissue kallikrein reduced the scratching behaviour induced by sodium deoxycholic acid, whereas treatment with soybean trypsin inhibitor to inhibit plasma kallikrein did not. 5. Although injection of kininase II inhibitor, lisinopril together with sodium deoxycholic acid did not alter the scratching behaviour, phosphoramidon, a neutral endopeptidase inhibitor, significantly increased the frequency of scratching. 6. Homogenates of the skin excised from the backs of mice were subjected to gel-filtration column chromatography followed by an assay of kinin release by trypsin from each fraction separated. Less kinin release from the fractions containing kininogen of low molecular weight was observed in the skin injected with sodium deoxycholic acid than in normal skin. 7. The frequency of scratching after the injection of sodium deoxycholic acid in plasma kininogen-deficient Brown Norway Katholiek rats was significantly lower than that in normal rats of the same strain, Brown Norway Kitasato rats. 8. These results indicate that BK released from low-molecular-weight kininogen by tissue kallikrein, but not from high-molecular-weight kininogen by plasma kallikrein, may be involved in the scratching behaviour induced by the injection of sodium deoxycholic acid in the rodent.", 
    "354": "Limited proteolysis of the dynorphin precursor (prodynorphin) at dibasic and monobasic processing sites results in the generation of bioactive dynorphins. In the brain and neurointermediate lobe of the pituitary, prodynorphin is processed to produce alpha and beta neo endorphins, dynorphins (Dyn) A-17 and Dyn A-8, Dyn B-13, and leucine-enkephalin. The formation of Dyn A-8 from Dyn A-17 requires a monobasic cleavage between Ile and Arg. We have identified an enzymatic activity capable of processing at this monobasic site in the rat brain and neurointermediate lobe of the bovine pituitary; this enzyme is designated \"dynorphin A-17 processing enzyme.\" In the rat brain and neurointermediate lobe, a majority of the Dyn A processing enzyme activity is membrane-associated and can be released by treatment with 1% Triton X-100. This enzyme has been purified to apparent homogeneity from the membrane extract of the neurointermediate lobe using preparative iso-electrofocussing in a granulated gel pH 3.5 to 10, FPLC using anion exchange chromatography, and non-denaturing electrophoresis. The Dyn A processing enzyme exhibits a pI of about 5.8 and a molecular mass of about 65 kDa under reducing conditions. The Dyn A processing enzyme is a metalloprotease and has a neutral pH optimum. It exhibits substantial sensitivity to metal chelating agents and thiol agents suggesting that this enzyme is a thiol-sensitive metalloprotease. Specific inhibitors of other metallopeptidases such as enkephalinase [EC 3.4.24.11], the enkephalin generating neutral endopeptidase [EC 3.4.24.15], or NRD convertase do not inhibit the Dyn A processing enzyme activity. In contrast, specific inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibit the activity. The purified enzyme is able to process a number of neuropeptides at both monobasic and dibasic sites. These characteristics are consistent with a role for the Dyn A processing enzyme in the processing of Dyn A-17 and other neuropeptides in the brain.",

    "356": "Some antihypertensive drugs may have a renoprotective effect, that is partially independent of their ability to reduce blood pressure. ACE-inhibitors are safe and effective agents that are capable of reducing proteinuria and preventing CRF progression. The results of the AIPRI extension study suggest that they may also have a long-term renoprotective effect. ACE gene polymorphism may partially influence the response to these agents. Angiotensin II receptor 1 antagonists (AT1RA) are effective in reducing proteinuria, but their clinical impact is still a matter of study. It has been shown that non-dihydropyridine and some dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCBs) reduce proteinuria and are also renoprotective, but there is a lack of large-scale prospective randomised trials. Given that the use of various drugs is usually needed to achieve good blood pressure control in patients with CRF, the possibility that a combination of ACE-inhibitors with CCBs or ATIRAs may have an additive renoprotective effect is intriguing.", 
    "357": "Recent epidemiologic studies have shown that ischemic nephropathy secondary to stenosis or obstruction of the main renal arteries in the cause of renal insufficiency in a growing number of subjects. The clinicians dealing with renovascular disease need non-invasive diagnostic tools and effective therapeutic measures to successfully face the problem. Duplex ultrasound scanning is a non-invasive, non expensive diagnostic tool and when an experienced, dedicated technologist is available, it should be suggested as the first-step test. Magnetic resonance angiography and spiral CT angiography play an ancillary role in detecting patients with renovascular disease. Captopril-enhanced (CE) scintigraphy when positive indicates the activation of intrarenal renin-angiotensin system and may be useful in detecting patients with renal artery stenosis. Moreover, CE scintigraphy can play an important role in the choice between the revascularization and a wait-and-see approach. As a matter of fact, the presence of an activated intrarenal renin-angiotensin system furnishes theoretical as well practical reasons in favour of the revascularization. In the recent years percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty has become the cornerstone of therapeutic strategy. The introduction of the metallic stent has dramatically improved its efficacy in ostial stenoses and has reduced the indication for surgical revascularization.", 
    "358": "Of the active fragments studied to-date, Ang-(l-7) is the most pleiotropic of the Ang I metabolities because it exerts effects that may be identical or opposite to those of Ang II. While much research remains to be done, accumulating evidence suggests that Ang-(1-7) stimulates the synthesis and release of vasodilator prostaglandins, augments the metabolic actions of bradykinin, and increases the release of nitric oxide. This explains why Ang-(1-7) activates antihypertensive mechanisms, particularly in situations of increased Ang II activity. In other words, Ang-(1-7) may act as a negative feedback hormone of the pressor and trophic actions of Ang II. The enzymes forming Ang-( 1-7) reinforce the idea that this peptide is a component of a vasodepressor system that regulates blood pressure. Both neprilysin and metalloendopeptidase 24.15 form Ang-(1-7) but also cleave bradykinin and atrial natriuretic peptide to smaller fragments. Our recent discovery that Ang-(1-7) is a major substrate for angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) adds a new and important dimension to the understanding of the biochemical physiology of the renin angiotensin system. Moreover, these data explain why Ang-(1-7) augmentes the hypotensive effects of bradykinin and contributes to the antihypertensive actions of ACE inhibitors. While the bulk of the research in hypertension continues to emphasize the investigation of the cellular actions of Ang II, our research has introduced new concepts and uncovered new mechanisms through which angiotensin peptides control homeostasis and influence the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease.",

Since then, short-term survival after heart transplantation has been markedly improved, but this development has not been paralleled with a similar improvement in long-term survival. One of the major reasons for this is the subsequent development of heart allograft vascular disease, an obliterative disease in the coronary arteries of the transplanted heart. The dubious effect of re-vascularization in this disease, the less favorable outcome after repeat heart transplantation, and the low donor supply have called for intensified research for new and efficient prophylactic therapies against heart allograft vascular disease. This research has lead to improved knowledge about diagnosis, etiology, pathogenesis, prophylaxis, and treatment possibilities. The most important among these seem to be: (i) the introduction of intravascular ultrasound for early detection of the disease; (ii) evidence to suggest that hyperlipidemia, insufficient immunosuppressive therapy, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-mismatch, and infection with cytomegalovirus (CMV) all may promote allografts vascular disease; and (iii) the introduction of at least two promising prophylactic therapies in humans namely 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors and calcium entry blockers, and others potentially promising e.g. angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitors, angiopeptin, mycophenolate mofetil and rapamycin.

Ensuing studies, focused on the analysis of new drugs such as calcium antagonists and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, also demonstrated a reduction in cardiovascular risk, even in severely damaged populations. Thereafter, meta analysis of new pharmacological treatments and of non pharmacological therapies such as sodium restriction, weight reduction, avoidance of alcohol intake, calcium and potassium supplementation have appeared.

The latter may reflect systemic immune dysregulatory states such as collagen vascular disease or human immunodeficiency virus infection. Among the iatrogenic causes are drug therapy with agents that abrogate lymphocyte function. These drugs encompass the anticonvulsants, antidepressants, phenothiazines, calcium channel blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. The appellation of lymphomatoid hypersensitivity reaction has been applied to cases of drug-associated pseudolymphoma. Pathologically and clinically, the distinction of such cases from cutaneous lymphoma is difficult. We employed the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on archival material of proven drug-associated lymphomatoid hypersensitivity reactions both to explore its utility as an adjunct in diagnosis and to investigate the genotypic aberrations induced by drug therapy. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded biopsy specimens from seven cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL), one nodal T-cell lymphoma, two cutaneous B-cell lymphomas, three typical hypersensitivity reactions, one tonsil, and 14 lymphomatoid hypersensitivity reactions were studied. Control cases for which DNA derived from fresh tissue was used include the Jurkat T-cell tumor line, placenta, one nodal B-cell lymphoma, and one case of reactive lymph node hyperplasia. DNA was obtained and purified by standard methods, then amplified with oligonucleotide primers specific for the T-cell receptor gamma locus and the immunoglobulin heavy chain genes. T-cell amplicons were analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and B-cell amplicons by either nondenaturing polyacrylamide or agarose gel electrophoresis. The nodal and Jurkat T-cell lymphomas, six of seven CTCL, one cutaneous B-cell lymphoma, and 2 of 14 lymphomatoid hypersensitivity reactions showed dominant (\"monoclonal\") T-cell gene rearrangement patterns, and the remainder of cases were polyclonal. A causal relationship between drug therapy and skin eruption was ascertained in the two patients showing T-cell rearrangements, and both experienced complete and sustained lesional resolution on discontinuation of the implicated drug. The only immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangements detected by PCR were in two of the three B-cell lymphomas. We conclude that PCR/DGGE is a powerful method for assaying T-cell clonality in archival tissue and can aid in the discrimination of reactive from malignant cutaneous infiltrates with appropriate clinicopathologic correlation. Recognition that a monoclonal TCRgamma rearrangement can be observed in cases of drug-associated lymphomatoid hypersensitivity may help in avoiding a misdiagnosis of malignant lymphoma.",

    "386": "Angiotensin (Ang) II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonists are orally active drugs that specifically block the subtype 1 of Ang receptors. In contrast to AT1 receptor antagonists, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors block the actions of Ang II incompletely. Furthermore, the bradykinin-potentiating effects of ACE inhibitors may contribute to the mechanism of action of ACE inhibitors. Data in experimental animals suggest that AT1 receptor antagonists decrease the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) to a lesser degree than ACE inhibitors. The greater effect of ACE inhibitors in decreasing glomerular pressure was attenuated with a bradykinin antagonist. In rat models of renal damage with proteinuria, acute reduction of proteinuria was seen with ACE inhibitors but not with AT1 receptor antagonists, whereas long-term reductions of proteinuria were of similar magnitude with both agents. Renal histology after several months revealed that AT1 receptor antagonists and ACE inhibitors were equally renoprotective in various renal damage models. AT1 receptor antagonists, like ACE inhibitors, exhibit a natriuretic effect equal to moderate doses of a thiazide diuretic. In patients with severe volume depletion, use of AT1 receptor antagonists may lead to acute renal failure. Valsartan was tested in a double-blind trial in patients with moderate to severe renal failure and led to a substantial decrease in diastolic and systolic blood pressure, whereas there was no difference from placebo for changes in GFR. Urine protein increased with placebo and decreased with valsartan. The data indicate that valsartan in renal failure patients is effective in lowering blood pressure while leaving renal excretory function unaltered. Whether there is a renoprotective effect can only be shown in long-term trials, which are under way.", 
    "387": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays an important role in blood pressure control and in water and salt homeostasis. It is involved in the pathophysiology of hypertension and structural alterations of the vasculature, kidney, and heart, including neointima formation, nephrosclerosis, postinfarction remodeling, and cardiac left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Recently, an increased knowledge of the effector peptides of the RAS, their receptors, and their respective functions has led to a new principle of treatment for hypertension: the inhibition of angiotensin (Ang) II via angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or Ang II-receptor antagonists. In this review, the Ang receptors AT1 and AT2 and the potential roles of shorter angiotensin fragments, including Ang III(2-8), Ang IV(3-8), and Ang(1-7), are discussed.", 
    "388": "A protective effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors has been shown in patients with diabetic nephropathy but has not been clearly established in nondiabetic renal disease. A multicenter European study was designed to determine whether the ACE inhibitor benazepril was safe and effective in protecting residual renal function in patients with various renal diseases and mild to moderate renal failure. The trial involved 583 patients from 49 centers in Italy, France, and Germany. The patients were randomized to receive benazepril or placebo plus other antihypertensive agents, the target being a diastolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg. Thirty-one patients in the benazepril group and 57 patients in the placebo group reached the end point [the time elapsed from entry to (a) doubling of serum creatinine (SCr) concentrations and (b) start of renal replacement therapy; p < 0.001 at 3 years]. The associated reduction in the relative risk of reaching the end point was 53% in benazepril-treated patients, with actuarial renal survival probability significantly better at 3 years. The best survival of renal function was observed in patients with chronic glomerular diseases and proteinuria greater than 1.0 g/24 h. Benazepril is effective in slowing the rate of progression and improving the survival of renal function in patients with renal diseases of various origins. This protective effect is associated with a clinically relevant decrease in both blood pressure and proteinuria.", 
    "389": "We tested the hypothesis that microalbuminuria screening in a general practice setting would identify high-risk nondiabetic hypertensive patients, and we measured microalbuminuria response to drug treatment. General practitioners were enrolled who had collected medical histories and performed physical examinations and routine laboratory tests in more than 11,000 untreated hypertensive, nondiabetic patients. Microalbuminuria was measured with an albumin-sensitive immunoassay test strip. The patients' mean age was 57 years, 51% were men, and mean duration of hypertension was 69 months. Twenty-five percent of patients had coronary artery disease (CAD), 17% had left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), 5% had had a stroke, and 6% had peripheral vascular disease (PVD). Microalbuminuria was present in 32% of men and 28% of women. In patients with microalbuminuria, 31% had CAD, 24% had LVH, 6% had had a stroke, and 7% had PVD. In patients without microalbuminuria, all of these rates were significantly lower: 22%, 14%, 4%, and 5%, respectively (p < 0.001). Furthermore, in patients with CAD, LVH, stroke, or PVD, microalbuminuria was significantly greater than in patients who did not have these complications (p < 0.001). A multiple stepwise regression analysis with microalbuminuria as the dependent variable showed microalbuminuria depended on the following factors, in order of importance: systolic blood pressure, retinopathy, CAD, diastolic blood pressure, and LVH (all p < 0.0001). A multiple stepwise regression analysis with each of the concomitant diseases as the dependent variable showed that microalbuminuria was an independent and significant variable for each of the conditions. The patients were assigned to monotherapy with either angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta-blockers, calcium antagonists, or diuretics. All of the drugs reduced microalbuminuria, although the beta-blocker carvedilol was superior (p < 0.05). We concluded microalbuminuria is an important risk factor that can be influenced by treatment.", 
    "390": "Aortic root flow and pressure estimates were obtained noninvasively with Doppler echocardiography and calibrated subclavian artery pulse tracing in 30 subjects with ambulatory hypertension in a randomized, crossover study with 4 weeks' treatment and washout periods. Total arterial compliance, assessed by use of a three-element Windkessel model of the arterial tree, increased 42% with atenolol (50-100 mg once daily), and 7% (p = NS) with captopril (25-50 mg twice daily). Atenolol reduced mean arterial pressure by 15%, heart rate by 22%, and cardiac output by 14%, and increased acceleration time of aortic root flow by 17% and stroke volume and ejection time each by 11%. Captopril reduced mean arterial pressure and total peripheral resistance each by 7%. Acceleration time of aortic root flow, ejection time, heart rate, stroke volume, and cardiac output were not significantly changed by captopril. We conclude that total arterial compliance, at the operational blood pressure, increases during selective beta1-adrenergic receptor blockade in subjects with ambulatory hypertension. Although the main mechanism may be a reduction in mean arterial pressure, it should be considered whether reduced heart rate may play an additional role. The nonsignificant increase in total arterial compliance during angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition may primarily be a consequence of a modest reduction of the mean arterial pressure.", 
    "391": "In patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and overt nephropathy glomerular barrier size-selectivity progressively deteriorates with time and is effectively improved by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. Whether similar glomerular functional changes develop in proteinuric patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), and whether antihypertensive agents can favorably affect glomerular filtration of macromolecules in these patients, has not been documented yet.", 
    "392": "We investigated renal hemodynamics and fractional clearance of neutral dextrans of graded sizes, in nine proteinuric patients with NIDDM and renal biopsy findings of typical diabetic glomerulopathy. Six healthy volunteers served as controls. We also investigated the effects of an ACE inhibitor and of a calcium channel blocker, both given in doses targeted to achieve a comparable level of systemic blood pressure control, on glomerular hemodynamics and sieving function. Theoretical analysis of glomerular macromolecule transport was adopted to evaluate intrinsic glomerular membrane permeability properties.", 
    "393": "Fractional clearance of large macromolecules (42 to 66 A in radius) was significantly higher in diabetic patients than in controls, and the distribution of membrane pore radii was calculated to be shifted towards larger pore sizes in diabetics (mean radius increased from 55 to 60 A). Despite effective blood pressure control, neither antihypertensive affected glomerular hemodynamics to any significant extent. Fractional clearance of dextrans, as well as of albumin and IgG, and total urinary proteins were not modified by either treatments.", 
    "394": "These data indicate that patients with NIDDM and overt nephropathy develop abnormalities in size-selective function of the glomerular barrier and, at variance to IDDM, such changes were not ameliorated either by ACE inhibition or calcium channel blockade.", 
    "395": "The renin-angiotensin system is thought to be involved in the progression of glomerulonephritis (GN) into end-stage renal failure (ESRF) because of the observed renoprotective effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs). However, ACEIs have pharmacological effects other than ACE inhibition that may help lower blood pressure and preserve glomerular structure. We previously reported a new animal model of progressive glomerulosclerosis induced by a single intravenous injection of an anti-Thy-1 monoclonal antibody, MoAb 1-22-3, in uninephrectomized rats. Using this new model of progressive GN, we examined the hypothesis that ACEIs prevent the progression to ESRF by modulating the effects of angiotensin II (Ang II) on the production of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and extracellular matrix components.", 
    "396": "We studied the effect of an ACEI (cilazapril) and an Ang II type 1 receptor antagonist (candesartan) on the clinical features and morphological lesions in the rat model previously reported. After 10 weeks of treatment with equihypotensive doses of cilazapril, cilazapril plus Hoe 140 (a bradykinin receptor B2 antagonist), candesartan, and hydralazine, we examined systolic blood pressure, urinary protein excretion, creatinine clearance, the glomerulosclerosis index, and the tubulointerstitial lesion index. We performed a semiquantitative evaluation of glomerular immunostaining for TGF-beta and collagen types I and III by immunofluorescence study and of these cortical mRNA levels by Northern blot analysis.", 
    "397": "Untreated rats developed massive proteinuria, renal dysfunction, and severe glomerular and tubulointerstitial injury, whereas uninephrectomized control rats did not. There was a significant increase in the levels of glomerular protein and cortical mRNA for TGF-beta and collagen types I and III in untreated rats. Cilazapril and candesartan prevented massive proteinuria, increased creatinine clearance, and ameliorated glomerular and tubulointerstitial injury. These drugs also reduced levels of glomerular protein and cortical mRNA for TGF-beta and collagen types I and III. Hoe 140 failed to blunt the renoprotective effect of cilazapril. Hydralazine did not exhibit a renoprotective effect.", 
    "398": "These results indicate that ACEIs prevent the progression to ESRF by modulating the effects of Ang II via Ang II type 1 receptor on the production of TGF-beta and collagen types I and III, as well as on intrarenal hemodynamics, but not by either increasing bradykinin activity or reducing blood pressure in this rat model of mesangial proliferative GN.", 
    "399": "We previously reported that bradykinin (BK; 1-1000 nM) facilitates norepinephrine (NE) release from cardiac sympathetic nerves. Because BK production increases in myocardial ischemia, endogenous BK could foster NE release and associated arrhythmias. We tested this hypothesis in guinea pig and human myocardial ischemia models. BK administration (100 nM) markedly enhanced exocytotic and carrier-mediated NE overflow from guinea pig hearts subjected to 10- and 20-min ischemia/reperfusion, respectively. Ventricular fibrillation invariably occurred after 20-min global ischemia; BK prolonged its duration 3-fold. The BK B2 receptor antagonist HOE140 (30 nM) blocked the effects of BK, whereas the B1 receptor antagonist des-Arg9-Leu8-BK (1 microM; i.e., 2.5 x pA2) did not. When serine proteinase inhibitors (500 KIU/ml aprotinin and 100 microg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor) were used to prevent the formation of endogenous BK, NE overflow and reperfusion arrhythmias were diminished. In contrast, when kininase I and II inhibitors (DL-2-mercaptomethyl-3-guanidinoethylthiopropanoic acid and enalaprilat, each 1 microM) were used to prevent the degradation of endogenous BK, NE overflow and reperfusion arrhythmias were enhanced. B2 receptor blockade abolished these effects but was ineffective if kininases were not inhibited. B2 receptor stimulation, by either exogenous or endogenous BK, also markedly enhanced carrier-mediated NE release in the human myocardial ischemia model; conversely, inhibition of BK biosynthesis diminished ischemic NE release. Because atherosclerotic heart disease impairs endothelial BK production, in myocardial ischemia BK could accumulate at sympathetic nerve endings, thus augmenting exocytotic and carrier-mediated NE release and favoring coronary vasoconstriction and arrhythmias.", 
    "400": "The effects of the long-term oral angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, cilazapril, on retinal circulation in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive (SHR-SP) rats were assessed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), corrosion casts and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Two groups of 20 male SHR-SP rats were compared. One group was treated with 10 mg/kg/day of cilazapril from 4 to 40 weeks of age, and the other group received no treatment. A third group of male Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats served as age-matched controls. At regular intervals the rats were weighed, and their systolic blood pressure was measured. Cilazapril normalized systolic arterial pressure to 121+/-2.7 mm Hg (SD) in the treated SHR-SP rats. There was no significant difference in body weight between the two groups of SHR-SP. In the 40-week-old SHR-SP rats without treatment corrosion cast and SEM revealed hypertensive retinal vascular changes. In the 40-week-old SHR-SP rats treated with cilazapril, these changes were markedly decreased to the level seen in WKY rats. The differences in caliber of retinal capillaries between the treated SHR-SP and untreated SHR-SP rats were statistically significant (p<.0001). TEM in the cilazapril-treated SHR-SP rats revealed intact basement membranes (0.29+/-0.057 microm) of the endothelial cells and pericytes, but in the untreated SHR-SP rats the basement membrane was thickened (0.51+/-0.123 microm) (p<.0001) and the pericytes damaged. Our results show that the long-term administration of cilazapril decreased systolic arterial pressure to a nearly normal level and prevented hypertensive retinal vascular changes, probably by improving endothelial function. The effects of cilazapril on the retinal vasculature are described for the first time. SEM of corrosion casts is a valuable technique for showing the effects of some drugs on the vasculature easily, precisely and three-dimensionally.",

The treatment in group D lasted for two years while group A was treated for 1 year and then was given D for another 2 years.", 
    "403": "After 1 year BP was significantly reduced in both groups and to a similar degree. The BP reduction was maintained during the rest of the study. After 1 and 2 years, HDL had increased significantly (p < 0.001) in group D. There was a corresponding significant reduction of the LDL/HDL ratio. In group A there were no changes after 1 year regarding lipoprotein levels. After the switch to D, group A showed similar improvements regarding HDL and the LDL/HDL ratio as the original D group.", 
    "404": "It is concluded that D and A are equally effective in lowering BP. However, long-term treatment with D, but not with A, has a favorable effect on HDL concentrations and the LDL/HDL ratio. According to these findings D affects the risk factor profile in hypertension.",

Quinaprilate (2.5, 5, or 10 mg BID) and quinapril (10, 20, or 40 mg OD) dosages were based on the patient's previous ACE inhibitor doses. The intravenously used dosages were half the dosages of orally administered enalapril, lisinopril and quinapril. Patients returned to their previous ACE inhibitor therapy during a second 1-day open-label phase.",

In the present study the antioxidant effect of captopril on lead-induced oxidative stress was studied in Fischer 344 rats. Their liver, brain and kidneys were assayed for glutathione (GSH), glutathione disulfide (GSSG), malondialdehyde concentrations, and catalase activities. The results from animals treated with captopril were compared to results of control and lead-exposed non-treated groups.

Most frequently, edema involves the face, oral cavity, and the glossopharyngeal or glottic area. Visceral edema induced by ACEI has also occurred.

    "416": "Hypercholesterolemia and hypertension are frequently associated with elevated sympathetic activity. Both are independent cardiovascular risk factors and both affect endothelium-mediated vasodilation. To identify the effects of cholesterol-lowering and antihypertensive treatments on vascular reactivity and vasodilative capacity, we studied 30 hypercholesterolemic hypertensive subjects. They received placebo for 4 weeks, either enalapril or simvastatin for 14 weeks, and, finally, both medications for an additional 14 weeks. Postischemic forearm blood flow (MFBF) and minimal vascular resistance (mFVR) were used as indices of vasodilative capacity and structural vascular damage, respectively. Total (resting-stress-recovery phases) cardiovascular (blood pressure [BP] and heart rate [HR]) and regional hemodynamic (FBF and FVR) reactivity to stressful stimuli were calculated as area-under-the-curve (auc) (valuextime). Compared with baseline levels, simvastatin reduced total (TOT-C) and LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) (1.27 mmol/L, P<0.001 and 1.33 mmol/L, P<0.001, respectively). Enalapril also reduced TOT-C and LDL-C (0.6 mmol/L, P<0.001 and 0.58 mmol/L, P<0.05, respectively). MFBF was increased substantially by both treatments (P<0.001). Enalapril had a greater effect (-1.7 arbitrary units (AU), P<0.001) than simvastatin (-0.6 AU, P<0.05) on mFVR. During stress, FBF increased more with enalapril (4.4 FBFxminutes, P<0.001) than with simvastatin (1.8 FBFxminutes, P<0.01). Conversely, FVR stress response was reduced more with enalapril (9.1 FVRxminutes, P<0.001) than with simvastatin (2.9 FVRxminutes, P<0.01). During combination treatment, a significant (0.001>P<0.05) additive effect on hypercholesterolemia, structural vascular damage, BP, and FVR was shown. The findings suggest that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition induces a larger reduction than HMG-CoA reductase blockade in vascular reactivity and structural damage in hypercholesterolemic hypertensive subjects.",

    "421": "We investigated the influence of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene on the onset and/or progression of diabetic nephropathy in 62 Japanese patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM; type II diabetes). Because a number of factors are believed to be involved in the onset and/or progression of diabetic nephropathy, especially in patients with NIDDM, we selected the patients with well-matched risk factors, duration of disease, glycemic control, blood pressure, and others. All patients had normal renal function and none were receiving ACE inhibitors. Patients were divided into three groups according to albumin excretion rate (AER): group A, patients with an AER less than 15 microg/min (n = 29); group B, patients with an AER between 15 and 70 microg/min (n = 19); and group C, patients with an AER greater than 70 microg/min (n = 14). The glucose disposal rate was estimated using a euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp. We determined the mean glucose disposal rate in 132 patients with NIDDM (6.49 mg/kg/min). Patients with a glucose disposal rate less than the mean rate were considered to have a high degree of insulin resistance (n = 36). The presence of an insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the ACE gene was determined by the polymerase chain reaction method. Among patients with a high degree of insulin resistance, diabetic nephropathy was present in 2 of 11 patients with the II genotype of the ACE gene compared with 19 of 25 patients with the ID or DD genotype (P = 0.0024). The prevalence of diabetic nephropathy was greater in patients with both significant insulin resistance and the D allele (19 of 25) than in the remaining patients (14 of 37; odds ratio, 5.20). These results suggest that the ACE gene influences the onset and/or progression of diabetic nephropathy in patients with NIDDM with significant insulin resistance.", 
    "422": "Childbearing is important to women with renal disease, but pregnancy has generally been regarded as very high risk in these women. In this review, an attempt is made to clarify the nature and severity of those risks in the settings of chronic renal insufficiency and end-stage renal disease, including dialysis patients and transplant recipients. Hypertension is the most common life-threatening problem in all three groups. A wide range of antihypertensive medications have been used, with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors the only drugs absolutely contraindicated because of their association with neonatal anuria, pulmonary hypoplasia, and neonatal death. Women with serum creatinine levels of 1.4 mg/dL or greater are at risk for accelerated loss of renal function compared with women who don't become pregnant. Transplant recipients have a risk for loss of renal function similar to controls as long as renal function is well preserved. The frequency of conception is decreased in women with renal insufficiency and markedly decreased in dialysis patients (0.5% per year). Return of fertility is the rule in transplant recipients. Exposure to immunosuppressive drugs, including prednisone, azathioprine, cyclosporine, and tacrolimus, has not been associated with an increase in congenital anomalies. These drugs, particularly cyclosporine, have been associated with small-for-gestational-age babies. Transplant recipients are at risk for infections that have implications for the fetus, including cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex, and toxoplasmosis. All groups have an increased risk for prematurity and intrauterine growth restriction. The percentage of pregnancies resulting in surviving infants in women with renal insufficiency and transplant recipients ranges from 70% to 100%. For women who conceive after starting dialysis, the likelihood of a surviving infant is approximately 50%.", 
    "423": "The cardiovascular activity of 14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographolide (DDA) from Andrographis paniculata (Burm.f.) Nees (Acanthaceae) was elucidated in anaesthetised Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats and isolated rat right atria. In anaesthetised rats, DDA produced significant falls in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and heart rate in a dose-dependent manner with the maximum decrease of 37.6 +/- 2.6% and 18.1 +/- 4.8%, respectively. The ED50 value for MAP was 3.43 mmol kg-1. Pharmacological antagonist studies were done using this dose. The hypotensive action of DDA was not mediated through effects on the alpha-adrenoceptor, muscarinic cholinergic and histaminergic receptors, for it was not affected by phentolamine, atropine as well as pyrilamine and cimetidine. However, it seems to work via adrenoceptors, autonomic ganglia receptor and angiotensin-converting enzyme, since the hypotensive effect of DDA was negated or attenuated in the presence of propranolol, hexamethonium and captopril. In the isolated right atria, DDA caused negative chronotropic action and antagonised isoproterenol-induced positive chronotropic actions in a non-competitive and dose-dependent manner. These results further supported the bradycardia-inducing and beta-adrenoceptor antagonistic properties of DDA in vivo.", 
    "424": "We examined the hypothesis that the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril at sub-antihypertensive concentrations could improve sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) CaATPase expression and function in compensated hypertrophied rat hearts. Five weeks after abdominal aortic constriction, rats received a daily dose (50 micrograms/kg/day) of ramipril or vehicle for 4 weeks. Cardiac angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity increased with cardiac hypertrophy (CH) but returned to normal following ramipril treatment. SR CaATPase protein levels and activity decreased with CH (P < 0.05) and were normalized following ramipril treatment (P < 0.05 for protein and activity). No change in phospholamban (PLB) protein levels could be demonstrated between any of the groups. In contrast, ramipril treatment specifically increased control SR CaATPase and PLB mRNA levels by > 60% (P < 0.01) and > 30%, respectively. In the hypertrophied group, SR CaATPase increased by 35% (P < 0.05 n = 6) after ramipril treatment. Calsequestrin mRNA levels were unaffected by ramipril administration. In conclusion, ramipril normalizes SR CaATPase protein expression and function in pressure-overloaded and compensated CH. The effects of ramipril are however multifaceted, affecting RNA and protein expression differentially.", 
    "425": "Although ACE inhibitors can protect myocardium against ischemia/reperfusion injury, the mechanisms of this effect have not yet been characterized at the cellular level. The present study was designed to examine whether an ACE inhibitor, cilazaprilat, directly protects cardiac myocytes against hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) injury.", 
    "426": "Neonatal rat cardiac myocytes in primary culture were exposed to hypoxia for 5.5 hours and subsequently reoxygenated for 1 hour. Myocyte injury was determined by the release of creatine kinase (CK). Both cilazaprilat and bradykinin significantly inhibited CK release after H/R in a dose-dependent fashion and preserved myocyte ATP content during H/R, whereas CV-11974, an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, and angiotensin II did not. The protective effect of cilazaprilat was significantly inhibited by Hoe 140 (a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist), NG-monomethyl-L-arginine monoacetate (L-NMMA) (an NO synthase inhibitor), and methylene blue (a soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor) but not by staurosporine (a protein kinase C inhibitor), aminoguanidine (an inhibitor of inducible NO synthase), or indomethacin (a cyclooxygenase inhibitor). Cilazaprilat significantly enhanced bradykinin production in the culture media of myocytes after 5.5 hours of hypoxia but not in that of nonmyocytes. In addition, cilazaprilat markedly enhanced the cGMP content in myocytes during hypoxia, and this augmentation in cGMP could be blunted by L-NMMA and methylene blue but not by aminoguanidine.", 
    "427": "The present study demonstrates that cilazaprilat can directly protect myocytes against H/R injury, primarily as a result of an accumulation of bradykinin and the attendant production of NO induced by constitutive NO synthase in hypoxic myocytes in an autocrine/paracrine fashion. NO modulates guanylate cyclase and cGMP synthesis in myocytes, which may contribute to the preservation of energy metabolism and cardioprotection against H/R injury.", 
    "428": "Recent evidence indicates that tubulointerstitial injury plays an important role in hypertensive kidney injury and that phenotypic changes contribute to this pathology. Moreover, angiotensin II is known to be actively involved in the pathogenesis of progressive kidney injury induced by hypertension. The present study was undertaken to see the effect of a newly developed angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1 receptor) antagonist on hypertension-induced kidney injury and to determine the contribution of phenotypic changes to morphologic alterations. Two-kidney, one-clip (2K1C), Goldblatt hypertensive rats (n = 27) were made by clipping the left renal artery. These animals were orally administered 57G709 (a selective non-peptide AT1 receptor antagonist)(10 mg/kg/day), captopril (20 mg/kg/day), or vehicle alone for 23 days beginning 4 weeks after clipping. In the non-clipped kidney of vehicle-treated 2K1 C rats, marked tubulointerstitial injury as well as glomerular sclerosis and/or hyalinosis was found in association with phenotypic changes, as shown by the neoexpression of vimentin in periglomeruli, perivascular walls, distal tubuli, and injured interstitium. Renin expression was markedly suppressed in the non-clipped kidneys of vehicle-treated 2K1C rats as compared with renin expression in normotensive control kidneys of sham-operated rats. Both 57G709 and captopril markedly ameliorated hypertensive kidney injury as reflected by the glomerular sclerosing index and by the tubulointerstitial index as determined by the point-counting method, and this improvement was accompanied by a significant decrease in blood pressure, urinary protein excretion, kidney/body weight ratio, and heart/body weight ratio. In addition, the vimentin neoexpression mentioned above was also suppressed with an inhibition of angiotensin II. These results suggest that in 2K1C Goldblatt hypertensive kidney injury, the AT1 receptor antagonist 57G709 exerts a potent renal protective effect associated with the inhibition of phenotypic changes.", 
    "429": "Multiple models explaining the pathogenesis of heart failure have been put forth during the past 5 decades. These models were modified as clinical evidence supported or refuted their assumptions. During the past 2 decades, heart failure models emphasized the importance of neurohormonal systems in heart failure progression. The positive impact that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have had on mortality from heart failure has bolstered the neurohormonal theory. Attention recently has turned to the sympathetic nervous system and its potential deleterious effects on the cardiovascular system in heart failure. The sympathetic nervous system can negatively impact the cardiovascular system in heart failure in several ways, including down-regulating beta1-receptors, exerting direct toxic effects on the myocardium, and contributing to myocardial remodeling and life-threatening arrhythmias. Beta-adrenergic blockers have shown promise for reducing morbidity and mortality in heart failure, but definitive reductions in mortality remain to be shown by future investigations.", 
    "430": "In the Hypertension Optimal Treatment (HOT) study, hypertensive patients who were randomly assigned to undergo antihypertensive treatment to achieve a goal diastolic blood pressure of 80 mm Hg or lower did not experience fewer cardiovascular events than did patients who received treatment with goal pressures of 85 or 90 mm Hg. Such aggressive antihypertensive treatment was safe and well tolerated, and did result in fewer cardiovascular events in the subset of patients with diabetes. All patients were randomly assigned to take aspirin 75 mg/day or placebo, and patients in the aspirin group had a 15% lower rate of major cardiovascular events and myocardial infarctions than did patients who received placebo. This finding establishes the efficacy of aspirin in preventing strokes and myocardial infarctions in hypertensive patients.",

    "439": "We previously reported that endogenous angiotensin II is released to cause mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase stimulation in the media portion of the vasculature. In this study, we examined whether a functional renin-angiotensin system is indeed present within the media of the vasculature. In rat aortic strips, endothelium removal produced an increase of MAP kinase activity. The MAP kinase activation was inhibited either by the renin inhibitor pepstatin A or by the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril. The degree of the inhibition of the MAP kinase activation by pepstatin A, captopril and the angiotensin receptor antagonist losartan was almost the same. Pepstatin A inhibited MAP kinase activation induced by renin but not by angiotensin I and angiotensin II. Captopril inhibited the MAP kinase activation induced by angiotensin I but not by angiotensin II. In nephrectomized rat aortic strips, endothelium removal also produced an increase in MAP kinase activity, but the MAP kinase activation was considerably small and minimally inhibited by losartan. Nephrectomy produced a marked decrease in plasma renin activity. These findings suggest that an apparently fully intact and functional renin-angiotensin system is present in the media of the rat vasculature and this system serves to increase MAP kinase activity. It appears that renin plays the determining role in the regulation of angiotensin generation also in the media and the major source of the renin is renin of kidney origin.", 
    "440": "The effects of two weeks of oral administration of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors captopril (a sulphydryl-containing drug) and enalapril (which lacks the sulphydryl group) on skeletal muscle glucose uptake, arterial blood pressure, cardiac hypertrophy, proteinuria and aortic vascular reactivity in obese Zucker rats were evaluated. Captopril (50 mg kg(-1) once daily) and enalapril (10 mg kg(-1) did not modify body weight gain or food or water intake. Both drugs decreased systolic blood pressure (157+/-6, 133+/-4 and 136+/-3 mm Hg, in vehicle-, captopril- and enalapril-treated rats, respectively), blood glucose (172+/-8 vs. 151+/-7 and 158+/-5 mg dl(-1), respectively), proteinuria (46+/-10 vs. 17+/-2 and 18+/-2.5 mg dl(-1), respectively) and heart weight (2.17+/-0.03, 1.98+/-0.02 and 1.99+/-0.04 mg g(-1)of body weight, respectively). Plasma insulin concentration was significantly increased by enalapril (17+/-2 ng ml(-1) vs. 9+/-2) but not by captopril (12+/-1). In the absence of insulin, the diaphragms from captopril- or enalapril-treated rats showed a significantly higher glucose uptake than that of controls (31% and 30% vs. control group, respectively). The presence of insulin in the incubation medium did not stimulate peripheral glucose uptake in the control group but significantly increased glucose uptake in diaphragms from captopril- or enalapril-treated rats (enhancement of glucose uptake vs. control: 52% and 43%, respectively). Endothelium-intact aortic rings from control Zucker rats showed a poor relaxant response to acetylcholine (maximal relaxation of 38.4+/-4.7%). Captopril significantly improved the endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation responses to acetylcholine and the endothelium-independent relaxation to the nitric oxide donor sodium nitroprusside whereas enalapril did not modify these relaxant responses. Neither captopril nor enalapril significantly affected the vascular contractile responses to the vasoconstrictors noradrenaline or KCl. In conclusion, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors captopril and enalapril reversed insulin resistance and the associated cardiovascular complications (cardiac hypertrophy, hypertension and proteinuria) in the obese Zucker rat, an animal model of non-insulin-dependent (type II) diabetes mellitus. However, only captopril, but not enalapril, improved the impaired endothelium-dependent and independent relaxant responses in the isolated rat aorta.", 
    "441": "The present study analyses the effects of hypertension and/or its oral treatment with captopril (angiotensine-converting enzyme inhibitor) on the rat median eminence (ME) and the posterior lobe of the hypophysis (PL). After an immunohistochemical reaction using an antibody against arginine-vasopressin, we compared by densitometry the amount of vasopressin immunoreactive material (vasopressin-ir) of these centers in 4 groups of animals: control Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY), spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), WKY rats treated with captopril (WKY-T) and SHR rats also treated with the same drug (SHR-T). Captopril was administrated at a dosage of 0.1 mg/ml in the drinking water from the 8th to the 15th weeks. We have found that the rats showing the lowest level of vasopressin-ir, in both ME and PL, were those from the SHR group, the concentration increasing after oral captopril treatment (SHR-T), although without reaching the values of WKY rats. Then, ACE inhibition by captopril influences vasopressin content in brain areas where the hormone is concentrated before being released, which supports the hypothesis that suggests a central modulatory effect of ACE inhibitors, contributing to their therapeutic action on hypertension.", 
    "442": "Clinical studies have shown that the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor antagonists decrease proteinuria and slow the progression of nephropathy in diabetes, indicating that Ang II plays an important role in the development of nephropathy. We have previously reported that high levels of glucose stimulate the expression of rat angiotensinogen (ANG) gene in opossum kidney (OK) proximal tubular cells. We hypothesized that the stimulatory effect of D(+)-glucose on the expression of the ANG gene in kidney proximal tubular cells is mediated via de novo synthesis of diacylglycerol (DAG) and the protein kinase C (PKC) signal transduction pathway.", 
    "443": "Immortalized rat proximal tubular cells (IRPTCs) were cultured in monolayer. The stimulatory effect of glucose on the activation of polyol pathway and PKC signal transduction pathway in IRPTCs was determined.

These stimulatory effects of D(+)-glucose (25 mM) were blocked by an inhibitor of aldose reductase, Tolrestat. PKC inhibitors also inhibited the stimulatory effect of D(+)-glucose (25 mM) on the expression of the IR-rANG in IRPTCs. The addition of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate further enhanced the stimulatory effect of D(+)-glucose (25 mM) on the expression of the IR-rANG in IRPTCs and blocked the inhibitory effect of Tolrestat.", 
    "445": "These studies suggest that the stimulatory effect of a high level of D(+)-glucose (25 mM) on the expression of the ANG gene in IRPTCs is mediated, at least in part, via the de novo synthesis of DAG, an activator of PKC signal transduction pathway.",

We evaluated the echocardiographic examinations performed during the trial in order to assess the trend of the remodeling process over time and to evaluate the role of infarct size in identifying patients at risk of progressive left ventricular dilation.", 
    "447": "A complete echocardiographic examination was performed on admission, before discharge and three months later. Patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery or PTCA had a further examination prior to the procedure. The echocardiograms were analyzed at a central laboratory, and the end-diastolic and end-systolic left ventricular volumes were computed by using a modified Simpson's rule technique. Regional wall motion was evaluated using the centerline method, analyzing the left ventricular boundary along 100 chords perpendicular to the centerline constructed midway between the end-diastolic and the end-systolic contours. A quantitative infarct-size index was then computed according to the number of chords with a fractional shortening equal to or less than 5%.", 
    "448": "Left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volume index significantly increased over time (p < 0.0001); as a result, the stroke volume increased (p < 0.0001) but the ejection fraction did not change. Patients were then divided according to the three-month infarct-size index. For both end-diastolic and end-systolic volume, not only did larger infarcts had higher volumes, but there was also a greater increase from baseline to 3 months. Moreover, larger infarcts had a lower ejection fraction, with a further reduction over the three months, while smaller infarcts had higher values and an increase over time. An infarct-size index of 25 or larger allowed prospective identification at the baseline examination of patients at risk of subsequent left ventricular dilation.", 
    "449": "In conclusion, patients at greatest risk of left ventricular dilation, namely those with larger infarct size, constitute a group that is worth considering for any therapeutic effort for reducing the remodeling process. These patients could in fact benefit from therapeutic strategies aimed at the reduction of left ventricular remodeling and should be studied in clinical trials.", 
    "450": "The choice of a polymeric support is a key factor for the success of solid-phase methods for syntheses of organic compounds and biomolecules such as peptides and oligonucleotides. Classical Merrifield solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS), performed on low cross-linked hydrophobic polystyrene (PS) beads, sometimes suffers from sequence-dependent coupling difficulties. The concept of incorporating polyethylene glycol (PEG) into supports for solid-phase synthesis represents a successful approach to alleviating such problems. Previous reports from our laboratories have shown the advantages of \"low-load\" PEG-PS (0.15-0.25 mmol/g) for SPPS. Herein, we demonstrate that the beneficial aspects of the PEG-PS concept can be extended with resins that have higher loadings (0.3-0.5 mmol/g).",

    "453": "630 patients of both sexes (422 males and 208 females) aged 74.6 +/- 6.1 were studied. Among significantly interrelated factors were: hypertension in 51.4% of the patients; diabetes mellitus in 9% of the patients; hypercholesterolemia in 31.3% of the patients; hypertriglyceridemia in 7.2% of the patients; cigarettes smoking in 19.3% of the patients, whereas obesity was present in 19.7% of all the subjects. Heart diseases directly correlated with heart failure were respectively: myocardial ischemia (65.6%); hypertensive cardiopathy (14.7%); idiopathic dilatative (15%); and valvular cardiopathy (4.7%). In 9.5% of cases, patients presented episodes of TIA, ictus, or they were carriers of neurologic focal deficiencies. As far as NYHA functional class was concerned, the third was most prevalent with a different distribution (p < 0.05) between males and females. ACE inhibitors, digitalis and calcium antagonists are to be indicated among the most widely used drugs. The health cost for patients in this survey was deduced on the basis of: average; hospitalization stay (9.8 days); estimated daily expenses for patient and for further controls (L. 282,000); the area of users (85% of residents). Therefore the full hospital assistance of patients with heart failure is approximately L. 2.1 thousand millions.", 
    "454": "Given the high preponderance of heart failure, the frequent relation with vascular risk factors and with ischemic cardiopathy, further investigation is necessary to curb these high rates. On the other hand, the NYHA advanced state of patients is not likely to allow lower costs in relation to hospital admission or the reduction of hospital stay. Nevertheless, the individualization of standardized therapeutic protocols and an adequate home care surveillance follow-up may reduce the number of hospitalizations and consequently the connected health expenses.",

The possible G-1-P-forming activities were surveyed in cell-free extracts of six species of Archaea. All the archaeal cell-free homogenates tested revealed the ability to form G-1-P from DHAP. In addition, activities of G-3-P-forming glycerol kinase and G-3-P dehydrogenase were also detected in four heterotrophic archaea, while glycerol kinase activity was not detected in two autotrophic methanogens. These results show that G-1-P is produced from DHAP by G-1-P dehydrogenase in a wide variety of archaea while exogenous glycerol is catabolized via G-3-P.",

Moreover, a significant positive correlation existed between plasma ET-1 extraction across the lower leg and SVR in these patients. Among the various neurohumoral factors and hemodynamics, plasma levels of ET-1, angiotensin II in the FA showed an independent and significant relationship with the plasma arteriovenous difference of ET-1 in the lower limb.", 
    "460": "Circulating ET-1 is extracted in peripheral circulation in patients with severe CHF, suggesting the possibility of upregulation of ET receptors of vascular beds in the lower limb in these patients.

    "461": "We conducted this study to evaluate whether there is an association between preoperative drug therapy and in-hospital mortality in patients undergoing coronary artery graft surgery. We collected data on 1593 consecutive patients undergoing coronary artery surgery. The relative risk of in-hospital mortality was determined by logistic regression with in-hospital mortality as the dependent variable, and independent variables that included known risk factors and preoperative cardioactive or antithrombotic drug treatment, i.e., age; left ventricular function; left main coronary artery disease; urgent priority; gender; previous cardiac surgery; concurrent cardiovascular surgery; chronic lung disease; creatinine concentration; hemoglobin concentration; diabetes; hypertension; cerebrovascular disease; recent myocardial infarction; prior vascular surgery; number of arteries bypassed; and regular daily treatment with beta-blockers, aspirin within 5 days, calcium antagonists, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, digoxin, or warfarin. In-hospital mortality was 3.3%. The relative risk of in-hospital mortality (with 95% confidence intervals of the relative risk) associated with the following drug treatments was: nitrates 3.8 (1.5-9.6), beta-blockers 0.4 (0.2-0.8), aspirin within 5 days 1.0 (0.5-1.9), calcium antagonists 1.1 (0.6-2.1), ACE inhibitors 0.8 (0.4-1.5), digoxin 0.7 (0.2-1.8), and warfarin 0.3 (0.1-1.6). We conclude that in-hospital mortality is positively associated with preoperative nitrate therapy and negatively associated with beta-adrenergic blocker therapy.

The abdominal constrictions were counted at 5-min intervals for 30 min. AngII at doses of 0.05, 0.1, and 1 microg exerted a dose-dependent antinociceptive effect. Saralasin, sarmesin, losartan, and PD123319 exhibited a dose-dependent effect on nociception: they either increased or decreased it. PD123319 antagonized the antinociceptive effect of AnglI while losartan was ineffective. The importance of AT2 receptor subtype for the nociception reducing effect of AngII is considered.", 
    "464": "Conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II likely occurs in human veins, supporting the existence of endothelial angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity in these vessels. Using the dorsal hand vein technique, we investigated the effects of 2 ACE inhibitors, captopril (single oral dose of 6.25 mg) and enalaprilat (local infusion of 1 microgram/min), on venous responsiveness in healthy subjects. Orally administered captopril induced a marked decrease in angiotensin I- but not angiotensin II-induced venoconstriction. This blunted response persisted for at least 4 hours. Enalaprilat and captopril increased the sensitivity to bradykinin, decreasing the dose producing half-maximal response (ED50) of bradykinin 18-fold and 5-fold, respectively, without changing the maximal venodilatory response. These results confirm that there is substantial rapid metabolism of angiotensin I in human veins and suggest that a single dose of locally infused angiotensin I can be used with the dorsal hand vein technique to assess the time-course effect of vascular ACE inhibition after oral administration. Our findings also extend previous in vitro observations in human veins by showing that these agents potentiate the venodilatory effects of bradykinin in vivo.", 
    "465": "Myocardial hypertrophy is one of the basic mechanisms by which the heart compensates for hemodynamic overload. The mechanisms by which hemodynamic overload is transduced by the cardiac muscle cell and translated into cardiac hypertrophy are not completely understood. Candidates include activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and angiotensin II receptor (AT1) stimulation. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that load, independent of the RAS, is sufficient to stimulate cardiac growth. Four groups of cats were studied: 14 normal controls, 20 pulmonary artery-banded (PAB) cats, 7 PAB cats in whom the AT1 was concomitantly and continuously blocked with losartan, and 8 PAB cats in whom the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) was concomitantly and continuously blocked with captopril. Losartan cats had at least a one-log order increase in the ED50 of the blood pressure response to angiotensin II infusion. Right ventricular (RV) hypertrophy was assessed using the RV mass-to-body weight ratio and ventricular cardiocyte size. RV hemodynamic overload was assessed by measuring RV systolic and diastolic pressures. Neither the extent of RV pressure overload nor RV hypertrophy that resulted from PAB was affected by AT1 blockade with losartan or ACE inhibition with captopril. RV systolic pressure was increased from 21 +/- 3 mmHg in normals to 68 +/- 4 mmHg in PAB, 65 +/- 5 mmHg in PAB plus losartan and 62 +/- 3 mmHg in PAB plus captopril. RV-to-body weight ratio increased from 0.52 +/- 0.04 g/kg in normals to 1.11 +/- 0.06 g/kg in PAB, 1.06 +/- 0.06 g/kg in PAB plus losartan and 1.06 +/- 0.06 g/kg in PAB plus captopril. Thus 1) pharmacological modulation of the RAS with losartan and captopril did not change the extent of the hemodynamic overload or the hypertrophic response induced by PAB; 2) neither RAS activation nor angiotensin II receptor stimulation is an obligatory and necessary component of the signaling pathway that acts as an intermediary coupling load to the hypertrophic response; and 3) load, independent of the RAS, is capable of stimulating cardiac growth.", 
    "466": "Preventive measures are the most powerful measures to treat manifestations of ischemic cardiopathy. Secondary prevention of myocardial infarction involves the following intervention areas: a) Limitation of adverse physiological and emotional consequences of the acute illness; b) Identification of the patients particularly exposed to the risk of new episodes of ischemic cardiopathy or to their consequences, namely reinfarction and sudden death; c) Institution of therapeutic attitudes, surgical or medical, that can prolong life and can oppose functional deterioration and prevent symptoms; d) Institution of measures that can oppose the progression of the initial disease that is, in almost all cases, atherosclerosis. Measures that can oppose the progression of cardiac disease and its consequences after an episode of myocardial infarction, and measures that can oppose the evolution of atherosclerosis are described in this article. The measures that can influence the risk factors after an episode of myocardial infarction are briefly commented: characteristics related to life style and physical exercise; smoking habits; plasmatic lipid levels; high blood pressure; and therapeutic substitution with estrogens after menopause. Pharmacological interventions in secondary prevention of myocardial infarction are described, namely with the following groups of substances: beta-adrenergic blocking agents; platelet active agents; anticoagulants; and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "467": "The relative roles of ANG II and bradykinin (BK) in the regulation of renal medullary circulation have remained unclear. We compared the contributions of ANG II and BK to the renal medullary blood flow (MBF) responses to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition (enalaprilat, 33 micrograms . kg-1. min-1) in dogs maintained on a normal-salt diet (0.63%, 3 days, n = 14; group 1) with those fed a low-salt diet (0.01%, 5 days, n = 14; group 2), which upregulates both the kallikrein-kinin and the renin-angiotensin systems. MBF responses to ACE inhibition were evaluated either before (n = 7) or after (n = 7) treatment with the BK B2 receptor blocker icatibant (100-300 micergrams) in both groups. Laser-Doppler needle flow probes were used to determine relative changes in MBF and cortical blood flow (CBF). ACE inhibition increased MBF (group 1, 33 +/- 9%, P </= 0.01; group 2, 24 +/- 9%, P </= 0.005) as well as CBF (group 1, 23 +/- 2%, P </= 0.006; group 2, 28 +/- 10%, P </= 0.05). These responses were prevented by prior blockade of B2 receptors in group 2, but not in group 1. These data indicate that under normal sodium intake, increases in MBF and CBF caused by ACE inhibition are primarily due to reduced intrarenal ANG II levels. In contrast, the renal vasodilatory responses to ACE inhibition in dogs on low salt intake were markedly dependent on the activation of BK B2 receptors.",

The transport characteristics of both compounds have been determined.",

The analogue with a reduced peptide bond does not show saturable transport from the mucosal to the serosal side, and cephalexin does not inhibit the flux of enamipril. However, the transport of enamipril from the serosal to mucosal side of the intestinal membrane is saturable and can be inhibited by 100 microM verapamil. Although enamipril is not a substrate for the small-peptide carrier in contrast to enalapril, both enalapril and enamipril are able to inhibit the active transport of amoxycillin with a K(i) of 0.41+/-0.24 mM and 0.24+/-0.12 mM respectively.",

Also because the transport of enamipril cannot be inhibited by cephalexin, the analogue with the reduced peptide bond is no longer a substrate for the intestinal small-peptide carrier. Therefore, it can be concluded that the carbonyl group is an essential structural requirement for transport by the small-peptide carrier. In contrast, the interaction with the small-peptide carrier is still present, shown by the inhibition of the fluxes of amoxycillin. Reduction of the peptide bond of enalapril resulted in a new substrate for the P-glycoprotein efflux pump.",

However, only drugs blocking the renin-angiotensin system (RAS, i.e. AT1-antagonist losartan and ACE inhibitor perindopril) have a long-term effect on blood pressure leading to values of systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 174.5+/-14.5 and 169.8+/-15.3 mmHg, respectively, at week 30. At this time, control, untreated PHR have a SBP of 222.0+/-16.6 mmHg (p<0.01 for both groups); age-matched PNR (Prague normotensive rat, bred in parallel with PHR from the same parent pair) exhibit values as low as 123.3+/-11.7 mmHg (p<0.01 from all other values). When losartan was administered to another group of PHR not only at weeks 5-9 but once more at weeks of 15-19 of age, the values of their SBP at week 30 were 156.8+/-12.64 mmHg, i.e., values significantly (p<0.01) different not only from 239.7+/-17.59 mmHg (value of the untreated PHR group) but also from 174.5+/-14.5 mmHg (value of PHR to which losartan was administered only once, at weeks 5-9). Thus, twice repeated administration of losartan in young age almost normalizes blood pressure deep into adult age. Proteinuria, a common finding in adult PHR, is also significantly lower in adult age in both groups receiving at weeks 5-9 drugs blocking RAS; the values at week 30 are 4.0+/-0.26 mg/24 h/rat in the losartan and 3.87+/-0.27 in the perindopril group, in contrast to 12.8+/-1.08 (p<0.01 for both groups) in control PHR. In conclusion, early brief administration (weeks 5-9 of life) of RAS-blocking agents to PHR led to long-term antihypertensive and antiproteinuric effects. These effects were significantly intensified by a second brief administration at weeks 15-19.",

The 2.2 A crystal structure of HC complexed to the peptidyl inhibitor, succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-chloromethylketone (CMK), was solved and refined to a crystallographic R-factor of 18.4 %. The HC structure exhibits the typical folding pattern of a chymotrypsin-like serine proteinase, and shows particularly similarity to rat chymase 2 (rat mast cell proteinase II) and human cathepsin G. The peptidyl-CMK inhibitor is covalently bound to the active-site residues Ser195 and His57; the peptidyl moiety juxtaposes the S1 entrance frame segment 214-217 by forming a short antiparallel beta-sheet. HC is a highly efficient angiotensin-converting enzyme. Modeling of the chymase-angiotensin I interaction guided by the geometry of the bound chloromethylketone inhibitor indicates that the extended substrate binding site contains features that may generate the dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase-like activity needed for efficient cleavage and activation of the hormone. The C-terminal carboxylate group of angiotensin I docked into the active-site cleft, with the last two residues extending beyond the active site, is perfectly localized to make a favorable hydrogen bond and salt bridge with the amide nitrogen of the Lys40-Phe41 peptide bond and with the epsilon-ammonium group of the Lys40 side-chain. This amide positioning is unique to the chymase-related proteinases, and only chymases from primates possess a Lys residue at position 40. Thus, the structure conveniently explains the preferred conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II by human chymase.", 
    "504": "Kinins have been shown to play an important role in the cardioprotective effect of ACE inhibitors (ACEi) during heart failure and ischemia-reperfusion. However, it is controversial as to whether kinins oppose the hypertensinogenic effect of deoxycorticosterone acetate plus salt (DOCA-salt) or aortic coarctation and whether they mediate both chronic antihypertensive and cardiac antihypertrophic effects of ACEi in hypertension. Using normal 129/SvEvTac mice and mice lacking the bradykinin B2 receptor gene (B2-KO), we investigated whether (1) the hypertensinogenic effect of DOCA-salt or aortic coarctation is enhanced in B2-KO mice and (2) the chronic antihypertensive and antihypertrophic effects of an ACEi (ramipril, 4 mg. kg-1. d-1) are mediated by B2 receptors in aortic coarctation (6 weeks)- and DOCA-salt (4 weeks)-induced hypertension. Before surgery, there was no difference between 129/SvEvTac and B2-KO mice in terms of blood pressure and heart weight, suggesting that kinins are not essential to maintaining normal blood pressure. DOCA-salt (volume expansion) or aortic coarctation (renin-dependent) induced similar hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in 129/SvEvTac and B2-KO mice, suggesting that kinins do not play an essential role in the development of DOCA-salt- or aortic coarctation-induced hypertension. We found that B2 receptors mediate only the early (1 week) but not the late phase (4 weeks) of the chronic hypotensive effect of ACEi in DOCA-salt hypertension. On the other hand, chronic ACE inhibition prevented the development of hypertension and LVH in both 129/SvEvTac and B2-KO mice given DOCA-salt or subjected to aortic coarctation, suggesting that kinins do not participate in the chronic antihypertensive and antihypertrophic effects of ACEi in these 2 models of hypertension. Thus, in mice, kinins acting via B2 receptors do not participate in (1) maintenance of normal basal blood pressure, (2) establishment and maintenance of hypertension induced by DOCA-salt or aortic coarctation, and (3) chronic antihypertensive and cardiac antihypertrophic effects of ACEi in DOCA-salt and aortic coarctation hypertension.", 
    "505": "Stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) on 1% NaCl drinking solution and Stroke-Prone Rodent Diet develop severe hypertension and glomerular and vascular lesions characteristic of thrombotic microangiopathy seen in malignant nephrosclerosis. We recently reported that spironolactone, a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, markedly reduced proteinuria and malignant nephrosclerotic lesions in these animals. This observation, together with our previous findings that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors prevent the development of vascular damage, suggests that mineralocorticoids, as part of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, play a pathophysiological role in this model. In the present study, we examined whether chronic (2-week) infusion of aldosterone can reverse the renal vascular protective effects of captopril in SHRSP. SHRSP received vehicle (n=8); captopril alone (50 mg. kg-1. d-1, orally) (n=10); aldosterone infusion alone (40 microg. kg-1. d-1, SC) (n=7); or captopril and aldosterone at 20 (n=6) or 40 (n=7) microg. kg-1. d-1. Systolic blood pressure was markedly elevated in all groups. Vehicle- and aldosterone-infused SHRSP developed severe proteinuria and comparable degrees of renal injury (21+/-3% and 29+/-3%, respectively) manifested as thrombotic and proliferative lesions in the arterioles and glomeruli. Captopril treatment reduced plasma aldosterone levels concomitant with marked reductions in proteinuria and the absence of histologic lesions of malignant nephrosclerosis. Aldosterone substitution at 20 or 40 microg. kg-1. d-1 in captopril-treated SHRSP resulted in the development of severe renal lesions (16+/-3% and 21+/-2%, respectively) and proteinuria comparable with that observed in SHRSP given either aldosterone or vehicle alone. These findings support a major role for aldosterone in the development of malignant nephrosclerosis in saline-drinking SHRSP, independent of the effects of blood pressure.", 
    "506": "In type 1 diabetic patients, ACE inhibitors exert a renoprotective effect which appears to be additional to, but not entirely independent of, changes in systemic blood pressure. This effect includes attenuation of albumin excretion rate (AER) as well as prevention or slowing of the rate of decline of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). In type 2 diabetic patients, the results of ACE inhibition are more varied with some studies showing similar renoprotection to that observed in type 1 diabetes and others showing no additional effect to lowering of systemic blood pressure. This may be due to the diverse manifestations of the disease itself or to renal factors which may modify the response to ACE inhibitors. The major systemic causes of diversity are variations in age, race and blood pressure. The major renal causes of diversity include changes in the relationship or 'coupling' of AER to onset of decline in GFR and a heterogeneity of renal ultrastructural changes in the glomeruli, tubules, interstitium and the renal vasculature. Factors that may be responsible for different renal responses to ACE inhibitors in type 2 diabetes include coexistence of coronary heart disease which may introduce survival bias in long-term studies, a lower specificity of microalbuminuria for diabetic nephropathy, early onset of a decline in GFR in hypertensive or normotensive patients at or prior to the onset of microalbuminuria, a greater contribution of arteriosclerotic changes in renal arteries to decline in renal function, a higher prevalence of nondiabetic renal disease, a higher prevalence of hypertension in the elderly and yet to be characterized genetic factors. These variants of type 2 diabetes may be expected to influence the response to ACE inhibitors either by altering the initial proteinuric response or by altering the hypotensive response. Future studies taking into account the above variables may help to determine the relative importance of the above factors in modifying the renal responses to ACE inhibitors and thereby leading to different renal outcomes in type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients. Such studies may also help to assess the relative importance of changes in systemic blood pressure and intrarenal effects as well as the role of hemodynamic versus structural factors in contributing to differences in renal outcome with ACE inhibitors in type 1 and type 2 diabetes.", 
    "507": "The range of known actions of amylin are reviewed together with the proposal that an important role for amylin may be the hormonal integration of diverse physiological systems activated with feeding. Major targets for the action of amylin are found within the kidney. Components of the amylin system (AS) have been shown to influence the activity of components of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), and vice versa, in normal, hypertensive and diabetic models. For instance, amylin injected into humans and rats elicits a rapid rise in plasma renin activity. Furthermore, in two models of hypertension (the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) and the model with subtotal nephrectomy (STNx)), the density of amylin-binding sites in the renal cortex associated with the proximal tubules, was associated with elevation of blood pressure. In normotensive controls and in the STNx model, but not in the SHR model, treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduced blood pressure and the density of amylin binding in the renal cortex. In Sprague-Dawley rats, angiotensin II (Ang II) infusion was associated with increased density of amylin-binding sites as well as elevated blood pressure. Thus, there appears to be a direct relationship between the activity of Ang II and the binding sites for amylin in the renal cortex. From these studies it has been postulated that the activation of the AS in the kidney may play a role in the genesis and/or development of hypertension in certain contexts. The transient expression of amylin mRNA has been detected perinatally, using in situ hybridization, in the subnephrogenic zone of the metanephros and is associated with proximal tubules of the developing nephron. These cells situated close to the glomeruli, represent a subset of brush border epithelial cells. Amylin immunoreactivity (IR) is also found in these cells and colocalizes with angiotensinogen IR. Thus a second important role for amylin is described in which it plays a role as a growth factor in the developing kidney and in renal regrowth in the adult kidney. In a model of IDDM (streptozotocin diabetes), amylin and angiotensinogen IR are both restricted to a subset of brush border epithelial cells close to glomeruli which, in the developing kidney, expressed amylin mRNA. Thus in this IDDM model, we hypothesize that amylin mRNA transcription which is normally downregulated in the adult, is upregulated in this subset of these brush border epithelial cells, and that it stimulates the activity of a local RAS by an intracellular mechanism, leading to the biosynthesis of Ang II. It remains to be determined that if amylin is playing a role in stimulating local Ang II production at these sites, this provides a mechanism for activation of TGF-beta, ultimately leading to interstitial fibrosis.", 
    "508": "Type 1 and type 2 diabetics have an enhanced renal vasodilator response to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition despite suppressed plasma renin activity (PRA), indicating possible activation of the intrarenal renin angiotensin system. To investigate the role of hyperglycemia, we evaluated the renal hemodynamic response to ACE inhibition in 9 healthy subjects in high-salt balance after steady-state hyperglycemia (8.4+/-1 mmol/L) was achieved via intravenous glucose administration. Renal plasma flow (RPF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) responses to captopril and to angiotensin II (Ang II) were measured as paraminohippuric acid and inulin clearances. Hyperglycemia produced a significant increase in RPF of 117 mL. min-1. 1.73 m-2 after 90 minutes but not GFR. Administration of captopril at a dose of 25 mg during glucose infusion led to an increase in RPF of 173+/-24 mL. min-1. 1.73 m-2 (P<0.01) but did not significantly change RPF in the absence of hyperglycemia (7+/-21 mL. min-1. 1.73 m-2). Captopril did not alter GFR in the presence or absence of hyperglycemia. Ang II infusion during hyperglycemia decreased RPF by 45+/-16 mL. min-1. 1. 73 m-2, and this was significantly enhanced by captopril (-98+/-26 mL. min-1. 1.73 m-2, P<0.05). In contrast, there was no enhancement of the vasoconstrictor response to Ang II in the absence of hyperglycemia. PRA did not change with hyperglycemia. Enhancement of renal vasodilation during hyperglycemia by captopril without alteration of PRA suggests activation of the intrarenal renin angiotensin system.", 
    "509": "Hypertension and kidney damage in the double transgenic rat (dTGR) harboring both human renin and human angiotensinogen genes are dependent on the human components of the renin angiotensin system. We tested the hypothesis that monocyte infiltration and increased adhesion molecule expression are involved in the pathogenesis of kidney damage in dTGR. We also evaluated the effects of long-term angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition, AT1 blockade, and human renin inhibition on monocyte recruitment and inflammatory response in dTGR. Systolic blood pressure and 24-hour albuminuria were markedly increased in 7-week-old dTGR as compared with age-matched normotensive Sprague Dawley rats. We found a significant monocyte/macrophage infiltration in the renal perivascular space and increased expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) in the interstitium, intima, and adventitia of the small renal vessels. alphaLbeta2 integrin and alpha4beta1 integrin, the corresponding ligands for ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, were also found on infiltrating monocytes/macrophages. The expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and fibronectin in the kidneys of dTGR were increased and distributed similarly to ICAM-1. In 4-week-old dTGR, long-term treatment with ACE inhibition (cilazapril), AT1 receptor blockade (valsartan), and human renin inhibition (RO 65-7219) (each drug 10 mg/kg by gavage once a day for 3 weeks) completely prevented the development of albuminuria. However, only cilazapril and valsartan were able to decrease blood pressure to normotensive levels. Interestingly, the drugs were all equally effective in preventing monocyte/macrophage infiltration and the overexpression of adhesion molecules, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and fibronectin in the kidney. Our findings indicate that angiotensin II causes monocyte recruitment and vascular inflammatory response in the kidney by blood pressure-dependent and blood pressure-independent mechanisms. ACE inhibition, AT1 receptor blockade, and human renin inhibition all prevent monocyte/macrophage infiltration and increased adhesion molecule expression in the kidneys of dTGR.",

We therefore aimed to develop improved, nonparametric regression methods for radio-telemetry data and to use these to assess the effects of pharmacological interventions on cardiac and vascular hypertrophy in the stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rat. One control group and 5 groups treated either with losartan (alone or in combination with NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester [ L-NAME]), perindopril (also alone or in combination with L-NAME), or hydralazine plus hydrochlorothiazide were monitored for 4 weeks. Cardiac hypertrophy was assessed by the left ventricle plus septum weight to body weight ratio and vascular hypertrophy by flow-cytometry analysis of vascular smooth muscle cell polyploidy. Hemodynamic series were split into trend and cyclic components by the seasonal and trend decomposition procedure based on Loess and compared between groups by Loess regression modeling. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were reduced systematically by losartan and perindopril (P<10(-10)) but to a lesser extent by hydralazine plus hydrochlorothiazide (P<10(-8)), and diurnal variation was reduced in the latter group (P<10(-6)). L-NAME significantly reduced the hypotensive effect only of losartan. Vascular and cardiac hypertrophy were significantly attenuated with losartan or perindopril, but were unchanged with other treatments. The new analysis proposed here identifies differential effects on trends and cyclic variation and associations with regression of end-organ damage for losartan and perindopril compared with hydralazine plus hydrochlorothiazide.

G2 and G3 rats were given 1% ethyleneglycol (ETG, precursor for oxalates), and G3 and G4 rats were given enalapril 20 mg/L in drinking water. At the end of the study, we evaluated renal tubulointerstitial lesions by a semiquantitative score. Urine albumin excretion, serum and urine nitric oxide production, tubulointerstitial immunostaining by alpha-smooth muscle actin, transforming growth factor-beta1, and collagen type III were measured. Rats belonging to the hyperoxaluric group treated with enalapril (G3) showed fewer tubulointerstitial lesions (1.3+/-0.2 versus 3+/-0.2; P<0.01), lower urine albumin excretion (8+/-2 mg/d versus 25+/-2 mg/d; P<0.01), less percentage of alpha-smooth muscle actin in renal interstitium (2+/-0.4% versus 13.5+/-2.4%; P<0.01), less percentage of transforming growth factor-beta1 in tubulointerstitial area (3.3+/-1% versus 13.3+/-2. 1%; P<0.01), less percentage of collagen type III interstitial deposition (0.7+/-0.5% versus 7+/-2.6%; P<0.01), and increased NO production in serum as well as urine (both P<0.01), when compared with the hyperoxaluric group not treated with enalapril (G2). Considering these data, we believe that enalapril, by several mechanisms of action, could provide an important benefit in the prevention of inflammatory response, transforming growth factor-beta1 tubulointerstitial production, collagen type III interstitial deposition, and finally, the progressive tubulointerstitial fibrosis caused by oxalates.", 
    "512": "Angiotensin (Ang) II-induced organ damage has fascinated students of hypertension since the work of Wilson and Byrom. We are investigating a double transgenic rat (dTGR) model, in which rats transgenic for the human angiotensinogen and renin genes are crossed. These rats develop moderately severe hypertension but die of end-organ cardiac and renal damage by week 7. The heart shows necrosis and fibrosis, whereas the kidneys resemble the hemolytic-uremic syndrome vasculopathy. Surface adhesion molecules (ICAM-1 and VCAM-1) are expressed early on the endothelium, while the corresponding ligands are found on circulating leukocytes. Leukocyte infiltration in the vascular wall accompanies PAI-1, MCP-1, and VEGF expression. The expression of TGF-beta and deposition of extracellular matrix proteins follows, which is accompanied by fibrinoid vasculitis in small vessels of the heart and kidneys. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and AT1 receptor blockers each lowered blood pressure and shifted pressure natriuresis partially leftward by different mechanisms. When combined, they normalized blood pressure, pressure natriuresis, and protected from vasculopathy completely. Renin inhibition lowered blood pressure partially, but protected from vasculopathy completely. Endothelin receptor blockade had no influence on blood pressure but protected from vasculopathy and improved survival. We show evidence that Ang II stimulates oxidative stress directly or indirectly via endothelin 1 and that NFkappaB is upregulated in this model. We speculate that the transcription factors NFkappaB and AP-1 are involved with initiating chemokine and cytokine expression, leading to the above cascade. The unique model and our pharmacological probes will enable us to test these hypotheses.", 
    "513": "-The determinants of the increase in arterial blood pressure associated with the use of estrogen-progestogen oral contraceptives (OC) remain poorly known. The purpose of this study was to assess the renal characteristics and the role of the renin-angiotensin system in women with OC-associated hypertension. Urinary clearances of technetium-labeled diethylene triaminopentaacetic acid (glomerular filtration rate) and 131I-ortho iodohippurate (effective renal plasma flow) were estimated before and after acute administration of captopril in 38 women who became hypertensive while taking OC, 38 non-OC users with essential hypertension matched for age, body mass index, and level of blood pressure, and 38 normotensive women (19 with and 19 without OC). Plasma renin activity was higher in OC hypertensives when compared with those with essential hypertension, but captopril-induced changes in blood pressure and renal hemodynamics and function were similar in both groups. In addition, 24-hours urinary albumin excretion was increased in OC users when compared with nonusers with similar arterial blood pressure. In 13 hypertensive women followed up for 6 months after OC withdrawal, a decrease in plasma renin activity, blood pressure, and glomerular filtration rate but no significant change in urinary albumin excretion and captopril-induced changes in blood pressure and renal hemodynamics were observed. These results indicate that the use of OC is associated with an increased albuminuria and no evidence of a prominent role for the renin-angiotensin system in the maintenance of high blood pressure and renal hemodynamics when compared with non-OC users with essential hypertension.", 
    "514": "Relapse of congestive heart failure (CHF) frequently occurs and has serious consequences in terms of morbidity, mortality, and health care expenditure. Many studies have investigated the aetiological and prognostic factors of CHF, but there are only limited data on the role of precipitating factors that trigger relapse of CHF. Knowledge of potential precipitating factors may help to optimise treatment and provide guidance for patients with CHF. The literature was reviewed to identify factors that may influence haemodynamic homeostasis in CHF. Precipitating factors that may offer opportunities for preventing relapse of CHF were selected. Potential precipitating factors are discussed in relation to the pathophysiology of CHF: alcohol, smoking, psychological stress, uncontrolled hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial ischaemia, poor treatment compliance, and inappropriate medical treatment. Poor treatment compliance in particular is frequently encountered in patients with CHF. Furthermore, studies of medical treatment under everyday circumstances indicate that some aspects of the management of CHF can be improved. In conclusion, the identification of precipitating factors for relapse of CHF may strongly contribute to optimal treatment. Improvement of treatment compliance and optimalisation of medical treatment may offer important possibilities to clinicians to reduce the number of relapses in patients with CHF.",

Although some angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been associated with pancreatitis, to the knowledge of the authors this is the first reported case involving benazepril. This case report presents laboratory- and image-proven pancreatitis in a noninsulin dependent 70-year-old man. The patient took benazepril at three different times and experienced the same epigastric symptoms 30 min after each dose. Possible mechanisms are reviewed. Clinicians should strongly consider discontinuing ACE inhibitors, including benazepril, in patients with pancreatitis of no identifiable source.", 
    "516": "A total of 254 elderly hypertensive patients (71 men and 183 women aged between 63 and 92 years, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 95-115 mm Hg inclusive) were treated with the fixed combination of verapamil SR/trandolapril following a 4-week single-blind placebo run-in period. Treatment was started with a response dependent 3-step dose titration period. All patients were initiated at dose step 1 (verapamil SR/trandolapril 120/0.5 mg o.d.) and if not normalised (DBP <90 mm Hg) titrated at 4-weekly intervals over dose step 2 (verapamil SR/trandolapril 180/1 mg o.d.) to dose step 3 (verapamil SR/trandolapril 180/2 mg o.d.) during the first 12 weeks. After 3 months of treatment all patients not normalised were excluded from further participation in the study. The total duration of the treatment period was 6 months. Routine safety investigations were performed prior, during and on completion of the treatment period. Verapamil SR/trandolapril was highly effective in reducing blood pressure. At individual last visit during active treatment (also taking the non-responders into account), the mean reduction in SBP/DBP was 21.9/17.1 mm Hg (95% CI 19.8-24.1/16.1-18.1 mm Hg), with most of this reduction occurring during the first 3 months of treatment. After 6 months, 81.9% of the patients enrolled showed normalisation of DBP (<90 mm Hg) and 85% were responders (normalisation and/or reduction in DBP by at least 10 mm Hg). Normalisation and responder rates appeared to be comparable when stratified by age subgroups (63-69, 70-79 and > or =80 years) and were all greater than 80%. Verapamil SR/trandolapril was very well tolerated and there was no evidence of any clinically relevant changes in routine laboratory safety variables or resting ECG. In conclusion, the fixed dose combination of verapamil SR/trandolapril is an effective and safe alternative treatment for the elderly hypertensive patient.", 
    "517": "In this multicentre, double-blind, parallel-group study, 120 out-patients with mild to moderate primary hypertension were randomised, after a 4-week single-blind placebo run-in period, to a combination tablet of felodipine-metoprolol 5/50 mg (Logimax, Mobloc, Astra) once daily or enalapril 10 mg once daily. If blood pressure (BP) remained suboptimally controlled after 4 weeks (supine diastolic BP >90 mm Hg 24-h post dose), the dose was doubled for a further 4 weeks. After 8 weeks felodipine-metoprolol reduced supine BP significantly more than enalapril (19.7/12.0 mmHg and 11.1/7.2 mm Hg, respectively). The mean differences in change in BP between treatments were 8.6/4.8 mm Hg in favour of felodipine-metoprolol (P = 0.001/P <0.001). A statistically significant difference to the advantage of felodipine-metoprolol was also seen in standing BP. Even though the dose was increased in a larger proportion of patients in the enalapril group (61%) than in the felodipine-metoprolol group (40%), fewer enalapril-treated patients achieved adequate BP control (41% vs 63% on felodipine-metoprolol, P <0.05). Both treatments were well tolerated. Three patients treated with felodipine-metoprolol and four with enalapril discontinued treatment due to adverse events. A similar number of patients reported adverse events in each treatment group. In conclusion, a combination tablet of felodipine-metoprolol 5/50-10/100 mg once daily reduced BP more effectively than enalapril 10-20 mg once daily 24 h post dose. The result was expected, but a more important observation was that both treatments were tolerated to a similar degree. Obviously, a considerable BP reduction may be well tolerated, as was the main purpose to demonstrate in this study.", 
    "518": "The aim of this study was to compare the effects of ramipril and nitrendipine chronic treatment on urinary albumin excretion (UAE) in hypertensive patients with type II non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and impaired renal function. A 2-year, prospective, randomised study was conducted on 51 men with a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) > or =95 and < or =105 mm Hg, stable NIDDM, serum creatinine between 1.6 and 3.0 mg/dl and persistent UAE >300 and <2000 mg/24 h. After a 3-month preliminary observation period, during which patients began a low-protein, low-sodium diet, and a subsequent 4-week run-in period on placebo, patients were randomly treated with ramipril 5 mg or nitrendipine 20 mg for 2 years. Both drugs similarly reduced BP without affecting glucose homeostasis. In the ramipril group UAE significantly decreased after only 3 months of treatment, whereas in the nitrendipine group a significant although lesser reduction in UAE was observed only after 1 year. During the second year the UAE% change was not statistically different between the two treatments. Serum creatinine and creatinine clearance showed no significant change with both drugs. The progression of renal insufficiency as assessed by the rate of reduction of creatinine clearance over the 2 years of the study was similar in the ramipril and the nitrendipine groups. In conclusion both ramipril and nitrendipine were associated with a decrease in UAE although such a reduction was earlier and more marked with ramipril. The decline of renal function did not differ significantly between the two treatments.", 
    "519": "BACKGROUND--Endothelin (ET)-1 is generated from big ET-1 by endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE). Plasma big ET-1 and ET-1 levels are strongly related to survival in patents with congestive heart failure (CHF). Because selective enzymatic processing of ET-1 formation appears to be an important therapeutic target for CHF, we investigated the acute effects of a specific ECE inhibitor on cardiorenal and endocrine functions in CHF compared with those of a selective ETA receptor antagonist. METHODS AND RESULTS--CHF was induced in beagle dogs by rapid right ventricular pacing (270 bpm, 14 days). Two incremental doses of a specific ECE inhibitor, FR901533, or a selective ETA receptor antagonist, FR139317 (1 and 3 mg/kg, n=8, respectively), were injected into dogs with CHF. FR901533 and FR139317 decreased mean arterial pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure associated with reduction in systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance. These agents increased cardiac output but did not affect left ventricular fractional shortening. FR139317 exerted a greater depressor effect on mean arterial pressure than FR901533 (P<0.05). These agents decreased plasma atrial natriuretic peptide levels, but only FR901533 decreased plasma renin activity, angiotensin II, and aldosterone levels. Neither agent changed the plasma norepinephrine level despite the fall in blood pressure. These drugs increased the urinary water and sodium excretion rate associated with increases in the glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow, and the incremental magnitude induced by FR139317 was larger than that by FR901533 (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS--An ETA receptor antagonist appeared to induce greater vasodilative effects on systemic and renal vasculature in CHF than an ECE inhibitor. However, the ECE inhibitor reduced the secretion of neurohumoral factors that are activated in proportion to the severity of CHF. Our acute complementary data may support the importance of the role of ECE in CHF and provide a rationale foundation for investigating the usefulness of long-term treatment with ECE inhibitors in CHF.", 
    "520": "The aim of this observational study was to evaluate how patients with heart failure (HF) are treated in Austria and which variables may influence usage and dosage of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. One hundred fifty-five hospital departments throughout Austria took part by responding to questionnaires on 4331 patients with a primary or secondary diagnosis of HF who were discharged during November 1996. A total of 1896 patients (44%) were taking an ACE inhibitor at admission, 868 (20%) patients were started on ACE inhibitor therapy in the hospital, and 64% were discharged while taking an ACE inhibitor. Triple therapy (ACE inhibitor, glycoside, and diuretic) was used in 34% of the patients. Conditions favoring ACE inhibitor therapy were hypertension (77%), diabetes (75% insulin-dependent, 70% non-insulin dependent), and age below 75 years (71%). Functional stage, gender, presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or atrial fibrillation, and a history of stroke had little influence on the prescription of ACE inhibitors. They were used infrequently and, if so, in low doses in patients with a serum creatinine levels above 2.0 mg/dL, the aged, or those with dementia. Geographic location also affected medication use. More educational efforts and more scientific evidence on the issue of adequacy of different doses will be needed in order to take full advantage of the beneficial potential of ACE inhibitors in the therapy of patients with HF in the future.", 
    "521": "It is now clear that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor treatment after myocardial infarction (MI) reduces mortality and morbidity. However, the benefits of ACE inhibition are not homogeneous and are largely confined to high-risk patients who have subjective or objective evidence of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. How long treatment should continue is a vexed question, which also arises with other agents, for example beta-blocker use after MI. The AIREX study assessed the long-term magnitude and duration of the survival benefits observed with ramipril in patients after MI who have clinically defined heart failure. The mortality status of all 603 patients recruited from the UK centres involved in the AIRE study was verified at an extended 5-year follow-up (3 years after the AIRE study closed). Ramipril assignation was associated with a 36% relative and a 11% absolute mortality risk reduction. These findings strongly support the view to select patients on the basis of impaired LV function and reinforce the previously reported conclusions of the \"selective\" ACE inhibition post-MI trials. Using this approach, the survival benefit is not only of large magnitude but also sustained over many years. These results also argue for life-long treatment with an ACE inhibitor, once a decision to treat an individual patient after MI has been made.", 
    "522": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been in clinical use for 20 years, during which time their application has been extended from the treatment of hypertension and heart failure to left ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction. They are also being used today for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy. More recently, the rationale for an antiatherosclerotic effect of ACE inhibition has emerged, based on more detailed understanding of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and the role of this system in atherogenesis, in addition to supportive experimental animal and preliminary clinical data. The possible clinical benefit of ACE inhibition in atherosclerosis is currently being assessed in several large-scale trials with both surrogate and clinical outcome measures in high-risk patients with clinically manifest atherosclerosis, principally coronary artery disease. The trials should further elucidate the mechanisms of benefit from ACE inhibition and further define their role in therapy of patients with coronary disease.", 
    "523": "Haemostasis depends on an intricate relation among plasma coagulation and fibrinolytic factors, blood cells, vessel walls, extracellular matrix, blood viscosity, and blood flow. Hormonal systems, such as the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) act as a protector against acute fluid volume loss by inducing both vasoconstriction to maintain blood pressure and the retention of salt and water to restore normal fluid volume. Studies have confirmed that this cascade of events is brought into action by the RAS in coordination and sequentially. Inappropriate activation of the RAS may occur, however, in patients with left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are indicated to counteract the vasoconstriction and salt and water retention associated with activation of the RAS.", 
    "524": "This presentation reviews data from epidemiologic and clinical trials on antioxidant vitamins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and homocysteine and their effect on atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

    "525": "The combination of a calcium antagonist with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor is increasingly used in the therapy of hypertension, but there are no experimental data supporting the use of this combination in acute myocardial ischemia and reperfusion. We tested the effects of oral pretreatment in a pig model, paying special attention to arrhythmias and adverse hemodynamic effects. Pigs received verapamil 240 mg + trandolapril 4 mg, verapamil 240 mg, or placebo orally once daily for 10 days, after which a coronary artery was ligated for 20 minutes and then allowed to reperfuse. The ventricular fibrillation threshold (VFT) was measured during ischemia to assess the vulnerability of the heart to ventricular fibrillation, whereas spontaneous tachyarrhythmias were monitored during reperfusion. Regional left ventricular (LV) blood flow was measured with radioactive microspheres. During the ischemic period, both the combination of verapamil plus trandolapril, and verapamil alone, prevented a fall in the VFT, indicating antiarrhythmic activity. The combination maintained LV contractile activity and cardiac output (CO) at preligation levels, whereas verapamil alone decreased cardiac output. During reperfusion, verapamil plus trandolapril prevented spontaneous ventricular tachyarrhythmias and increased blood flow in the reperfused zone. In contrast, verapamil was not antiarrhythmic and decreased CO. Thus the addition of the ACE inhibitor trandolapril to the calcium antagonist verapamil resulted in antiarrhythmic activity during ischemia and reperfusion, and produced a better hemodynamic profile.", 
    "526": "The effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) blocker temocapril on the capillary network of the left ventricle were studied in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP). The ACE blocker was dissolved in the drinking water and supplied to 24 and 32 week old SHRSP ad libitum for 5 weeks. The capillaries of the wall of the left ventricle were studied using a double staining method to differentiate the arteriolar, intermediate and venular capillary portions. Capillary density increased and capillary domain areas decreased in all capillary portions compared with untreated control SHRSP in both age groups. The proportion of venular capillary portions was increased by temocapril treatment. The results indicate that the late start of ACE blockade caused the regression of the hypertrophied cardiomyocytes, which is characteristic of SHRSP, and the rearrangement of capillary portions. The plasma concentration of angiotensin II was significantly lower in temocapril-treated SHRSP compared to the control group. The implication is that intrinsic angiotensin II exerts an appreciable effect on the function, structure and capillary network in the left ventricular wall in SHRSP.", 
    "527": "Thiol containing compounds exhibiting antioxidant properties are currently being evaluated for use in cytoprotection and chemoprevention. Many of these have also been found to be effective in inhibiting cell cycle progression and cellular proliferation. N-Acetyl-L-cysteine (L-NAC), along with its nonmetabolically active stereoisomer N-acetyl-D-cysteine (D-NAC), together with captopril and dithiothreitol (DTT) were investigated to assess their effects on cell cycle progression as determined by flow cytometry. Topoisomerase-IIa (topo-II alpha) activity, an enzyme involved in DNA synthesis, was also monitored as a function of drug dose using a kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) decatenation assay. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) AA8 cells were exposed to each thiol at concentrations ranging from 4 microM to 4 mM for a period of 3 h. Following the removal of the thiols, cell cultures were followed for an additional 5 h to assess changes in cell cycle progression. L-NAC, which also serves as a precursor for glutathione (GSH) synthesis, effectively inhibited topo-IIa activity by at least 50% at all concentrations tested. Associated with this reduction in enzyme activity was a sixfold increase in the relative number of cells accumulating in G2phase. D-NAC, which is unable to participate in GSH synthesis, was only half as effective as L-NAC at each concentration tested in inhibiting topo-IIa activity as well as perturbing cell progression through G2. In comparison, captopril, an inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), had little effect on the progression of cells into G2 phase. In contrast to the repressive effects of L-NAC and D-NAC, it enhanced topo-IIa activity over control values by approximately 20%. DTT, a well characterized thiol known to be capable of reducing disulphides in proteins, was observed to be relatively ineffective in either perturbing cell cycle progression or affecting topo-IIa activity. This suggests an involvement of a mechanism(s) in addition to thiol mediated affects on reduction/oxidation processes. The inhibitory effects of L-NAC and D-NAC on topo-IIa activity, in contrast to the other two thiols, may be due in part to the presence of amine groups which could allow for their participation in polyamine related processes. The difference in the magnitude of the effect exhibited by L-NAC, as compared to D-NAC, on the repression topo-IIa activity also suggests a role for GSH in this process. Inhibition of cellular progression and proliferation by thiols can therefore be mediated by diverse mechanisms which include both cycle-phase specific (i.e. L-NAC and D-NAC) and non cell cycle specific (i.e. captopril) processes.", 
    "528": "A series of 7-(di)alkyl and spirocyclic substituted azepinones were generated and incorporated as conformationally restricted dipeptide surrogates in mercaptoacyl dipeptides. Clear structure-activity relationships with respect to both angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and neutral endopeptidase (NEP) activity in vitro were observed. The best in this series, compound 1g, a geminally dimethylated C-7-substituted azepinone, demonstrated excellent blood pressure lowering in animal models. Compound 1g (BMS-189921) is characterized by a good duration of activity and excellent oral efficacy in models relevant to ACE or NEP inhibition, and its activity is comparable to that of the clinically efficacious agent omapatrilat. Consequently this inhibitor has been advanced clinically for the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure.", 
    "529": "Since angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) produces angiotensin II in the heart, ACE inhibitors may prevent coronary vasoconstriction and increase coronary blood flow. On the other hand, since ACE inhibitors also inhibit kininase II which results in reduced degradation of bradykinin, ACE inhibitors may increase cardiac nitric oxide (NO) levels via stimulation of bradykinin receptors. This study was undertaken to test whether ACE inhibitors increase the cardiac NO levels and coronary blood flow in the ischemic myocardium. In 34 open-chest dogs, the left anterior descending coronary artery was perfused through an extracorporeal bypass tube from the left carotid artery. When either imidaprilat or cilazaprilat of 3 microg/kg/min was infused into the bypass tube for 10 min after reduction of coronary blood flow due to partial occlusion of the bypass tube, coronary blood flow increased from 31 +/- 1 to either 45 +/- 5 or 43 +/- 4 ml/100 g/min despite no changes in coronary perfusion pressure (43 +/- 2 mmHg). During an infusion of either imidaprilat or cilazaprilat, bradykinin and the end-products of NO (nitrate + nitrite) concentrations of coronary venous blood were markedly increased, which were attenuated by either HOE-140 (an inhibitor of bradykinin receptors) or by N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (an inhibitor of NO synthase). We also observed increases in cardiac bradykinin and NO levels due to either imidaprilat or cilazaprilat in the low constant coronary blood flow condition. It is concluded that ACE inhibitors can increase cardiac NO levels via the accumulation of bradykinin in the ischemic myocardium.", 
    "530": "Two sensitive, spectrophotometric and atomic absorption spectrometric procedures are developed for the determination of ramipril and perindopril. Both methods are based on the formation of a ternary complex, extractable with chloroform, between copper(II), eosin and the two cited drugs. Spectrophotometrically under the optimum condition, the ternary complexes showed an absorption maximum at 535 nm, with apparent molar absorptivities of 6.55 and 4.00 x 10(3) mol(-1) x cm(-1) and Sandell's sensitivities of 5.80 x 10(-2) and 1.04 x 10(-1) microg x cm(-2) for perindopril and ramipril, respectively. The solution of ternary complex obeyed Beer's law in concentration ranges 10-60 and 20-100 microg x ml(-1) for perindopril and ramipril, respectively. The proposed method was applied to the determination of the two cited drugs in pharmaceutical tablets. The atomic absorption spectrometric method, directly through the quantitative determination of copper content of the organic extract of the complex, was also investigated for the purpose of enhancing the sensitivity of the determination. The spectrophotometric and atomic absorption spectrometric procedures hold their accuracy and precision well when applied to the determination of ramipril and perindopril dosage forms.", 
    "531": "Past studies have shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (ACEI) alone, angiotensin AT1 receptor blockade (AT1 block) alone, and combined treatment have differential effects on left ventricular (LV) function and geometry with developing congestive heart failure (CHF). The purpose of this study was to more carefully examine the cellular basis for these differential effects by using a model of pacing CHF.", 
    "532": "Pigs were randomly assigned to five groups: (1) rapid pacing (240 bpm) for 3 weeks (n = 9), (2) concomitant ACEI (benazeprilat, 0.187 mg/kg/day) and pacing (n = 9), (3) concomitant AT1 block (valsartan, 3 mg/kg/day) and pacing (n = 9), (4) concomitant ACEI and AT1 receptor blockade (benazeprilat/valsartan, 0.05/3 mg/kg/day, respectively) and pacing (n = 9), and (5) sham controls (n = 10). The dosage protocol was based on obtaining a 50% reduction in angiotensin I and angiotensin II pressor response with no significant effects on mean basal arterial pressure. In the pacing group, LV fractional shortening (LVFS) fell compared with control group (13.4+/-1.4 v 39.1+/-1.0%, P < .05). With AT1 block, LVFS was unchanged from pacing only. ACEI and combined treatment increased LVFS from pacing values (25.2+/-0.9 v 20.9+/-1.9%, respectively, P < .05). LV myocyte shortening velocity was reduced with chronic pacing compared with control group (27.2+/-0.6 v 58.6+/-1.2 microm/s, P < .05) and remained reduced with AT1 block (28.0+/-0.5 microm/s, P < .05). Myocyte shortening velocity increased with ACEI or combination treatment (36.9+/-0.7 v 42.3+/-0.8 microm/s, respectively, P < .05). Concomitant treatment with either ACEI or AT1 blockade normalized myocyte action potential duration. In the combined ACEI and AT1 blockade group, all parameters of the myocyte action potential were unchanged from control values.",

The mechanisms of hypotension reportedly are related to peripheral vasodilation, a decrease in cardiac output, and left ventricular (LV) cavity obliteration. DSE is performed increasingly in women and in patients with LV dysfunction. However, the impact of gender and LV dysfunction on DSE-induced hypotension has not been elucidated.",

Hypotension was also more common in older adults (P = .004), persons taking diuretics (P = .025) or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (P = .01), and persons with higher baseline blood pressures (P < .0001). Hypotension was not related to the use of beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin, nitrates, LV dimensions, or ejection fraction.",

    "537": "Hyperhomocysteinemia is a risk factor for arterial diseases, and the deterioration of the arterial elastic structures is one of the possible mechanisms underlying this epidemiological association. The aim of this paper is to quantitatively characterize such structural alterations and to explore their causes in a previous model of dietary induced mild hyperhomocysteinemia in minipigs. After four months, both a morphodensitometrical analysis of the elastic structure and a biochemical analysis of elastin and elastase activities were performed on the infrarenal abdominal aorta (IRAA) and the proximal left interventricular coronary artery (LIVCA) of control (C), hyperhomocysteinemic (H) and captopril-hydrochlorothiazide (Cp-Htz, 25 + 12.5 mg/d)-treated (H+/-Cp) minipigs (n = 8/group). Hyperhomocysteinemia was found to induce an increase in parietal elastolytic metalloproteinase activities. It resulted in opening and enlargement of fenestrae through the medial elastic laminae and in a decrease in medial elastin content (p < 10(-3)), expressed as well as volume density (%) as weight concentration (microg elastin/mg dry tissue). The thickness of the media and its basic lamellar organization was unchanged. The reduction in volume density was more dramatic in LIVCA (H: 4.7 +/- 0.9 vs C: 8.8 +/- 2.4), where it was evenly distributed within the media, than in IRAA (H: 6.7 +/- 1.1 vs C: 9.3 +/- 1.2), where the deep medial layers were less affected. Cp-Htz partly prevented the hyperhomocysteinemia-induced reduction of the medial elastin content in LIVCA (5.7 +/- 1.2) and IRAA (7.9 +/- 1.4). This effect, occurring in the subintimal layers of the media in both arteries but not in the deeper layers, resulted in a less beneficial effect in LIVCA than in IRAA. This result parallels the moderate beneficial therapeutic effect of ACE inhibitors against coronary atherosclerosis in humans. This paper reports for the first time a quantitative analysis of the arterial site-dependent deterioration of the elastic structure caused by mild hyperhomocysteinemia and the involvement of metalloproteinases in this process. These results confirm that the plaque-independent damage to elastic structure previously described in hyperhomocysteinemic-atherosclerotic minipigs was mainly due to homocysteine. This highlights that the metalloproteinase-related elastolysis and the subsequent structural deterioration is one of the major events underlying the epidemiological association between mild hyperhomocysteinemia and arterial diseases.", 
    "538": "Diffuse hypoxic pneumonia was found to be caused by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in two patients given enalapril and fosinopril for hypertension. Both patients developed sub-acute respiratory failure and lost weight. Imaging explorations showed multiple areas of alveolar consolidation, moderate pleural effusion and in one case linear opacities. In both cases, peripheral eosinophila was found and the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid contained lymphocytes. Progressive improvement was achieved after withdrawal of the ACE and corticosteroid therapy for three months. Subsequent x-rays and respiratory function tests returned to normal apart from persistently low CO diffusion in one patient. In view of other cases reported in the literature, ACE inhibitors should probably be included in the list of drugs capable of inducing pneumonia, notably eosinophilic pneumonia.", 
    "539": "In animal experimental models angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been found to reduce arrhythmias. In patients with cardiovascular disorders treated with ACE inhibitors the reduction of incidence and the severity of arrhythmias as well as the decrease mortality have been observed. There is little evidence to prove that ACE inhibitors affect directly the electrophysiological function of a heart. It seems that antiarrhythmic effects of ACE inhibitors are indirect.", 
    "540": "Water intake was elevated in sodium-depleted rats during a daytime salt appetite test, but other rats drank a similar amount of water when saline was not available for drinking during the test. This water intake stimulated by sodium depletion was blocked by an inhibition of angiotensin (ANG) II synthesis with a high dose of captopril (100 mg/kg, sc). Captopril did not reduce water intake by causing hypotensive shock or uremia, because water and saline intakes were increased rather than decreased after a low dose of captopril (5 mg/kg) that also reduced blood pressure and elevated blood urea nitrogen. The water intake, but not salt appetite, induced by sodium depletion was greatly reduced by a lesion of the subfornical organ (SFO) in one-bottle tests, and this was not clearly related to any effects of the lesion on blood pressure. A physiological role for ANG II in water intake induced by sodium depletion has recently been disputed, but the simplest explanation for the data remains that elevated levels of circulating ANG II bind to receptors in the SFO to generate daytime water drinking during sodium depletion.", 
    "541": "Tetanus toxin (TeTx) is a powerful clostridial neurotoxin that inhibits Ca2+-dependent neurotransmitter secretion as do the botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs). We found that TeTx (but not BoNT/A) produced a specific time- and dose-dependent inhibition of Na+-dependent [3H]5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin, 5-HT) uptake in rat CNS synaptosomes. This effect was found in all CNS tryptaminergic areas, being maximal in the hippocampus and occipital cortex. TeTx produced the maximum reduction in [3H]5-HT uptake after 30 min of preincubation, being significant also at lower doses (10(-12) M) or shorter incubation times (10 min). Serotonin transport inhibitors such as fenfluramine (IC50, 11.0 +/- 0.9 microM), paroxetine (IC50, 33.5 +/- 0.1 microM), and imipramine (IC50, 89.9 +/- 5.7 microM) were 3 or 4 orders of magnitude less potent than TeTx (IC50, 8.7 +/- 1.0 nM). Of the two fragments of TeTx, (the C-terminal portion of the neurotoxin heavy chain, which is responsible for the binding to the nerve tissue) was consistently more effective than the L-H(N) fragment (the light neurotoxin chain disulfide linked to the N-terminal portion of the heavy chain, which is responsible for the toxic metalloprotease action) as inhibitor of [3H]5-HT uptake in synaptosomal preparations (56 +/- 5% and 95 +/- 3% with respect to control, respectively). Antagonism of the toxin-induced [3H]5-HT uptake blockade could not be reversed by zinc chelators but did have the ability to antagonize the TeTx inhibition of basal and K+-evoked [3H]5-HT release in rat synaptosomes. The reduction in serotonin accumulation induced by TeTx could be responsible for some tetanic symptoms that have been related to the serotonergic system.", 
    "542": "The intra-third-ventricular (i.t.v.) administration of [Met5]-enkephalin (enk) to rats pretreated i.t.v. with three peptidase inhibitors (PIs), amastatin, captopril and phosphoramidon, inhibited the tail-flick response. The enk-induced inhibition was augmented by increasing the doses of the three PIs, with the maximum inhibition being attained at the doses of 10 nmol each. The enk-induced inhibition in rats pretreated with any combination of two PIs, however, were markedly smaller than that in rats pretreated with all three PIs, indicating that three kinds of enzymes all played important roles in the inactivation of enk. The inhibitory effect of enk on the tail-flick response in rats pretreated with the three PIs at doses of 10 nmol each was approximately tenfold higher than that of morphine. The relative anti-nociceptive potencies of enk and morphine were similar to the relative inhibitory potencies obtained previously with the isolated guinea pig ileum pretreated with the three PIs, indicating that the hydrolysis of the i.t.v. administered enk was largely prevented by the three PIs. However, the magnitude of the enk-induced inhibition in rats pretreated s.c. with the three PIs indicated that the hydrolysis of enk injected i.t.v. was not largely prevented by the s.c. administration of three PIs at doses up to 10 micromol each/kg.", 
    "543": "Kinins are biologically active peptides that exert their effects by activating two seven transmembrane G-protein coupled receptors termed B1 and B2 which have only about 36% of homology. The major kinin peptide under physiological conditions, bradykinin (BK), modulates renal haemodynamics and function. Under physiological conditions most BK effects involve bradykinin B2-receptors. Studies on the intra-cellular transduction pathways, the regulation of the expression and the localisation of these receptors along the nephron, as well as the first studies on transgenic mice models, have allowed to better define the role of these receptors under physiological and pathological conditions. The role of the renal B1-receptor, induced in a variety of pathologies related to inflammation, is poorly understood. Recent investigations on the molecular mechanism of B1-receptor induction and its detailed renal localisation have shown that under inflammatory conditions this kinin receptor might be of importance. B2-receptors are suggested to be involved in part of the renoprotective effects of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors in insulin-dependent diabetes. However, ACE-inhibitor treatment, resulting also in an increased B1-agonist concentration might result in homologous induction and activation of the B1-receptor.", 
    "544": "Increasing evidence suggests that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors can increase vascular nitric oxide (NO) production. Recent studies have found that combined inhibition of ACE and neutral endopeptidase (NEP) may have a greater beneficial effect in the treatment of heart failure than inhibition of ACE alone. Amlodipine, a calcium channel antagonist, has also been reported to have a favorable effect in the treatment of patients with cardiac dysfunction. The purpose of this study was to determine whether and the extent to which all of these agents used in the treatment of heart failure stimulate vascular NO production. Heart failure was induced by rapid ventricular pacing in conscious dogs. Coronary microvessels were isolated from normal and failing dog hearts. Nitrite, the stable metabolite of NO, was measured by the Griess reaction. ACE and NEP inhibitors and amlodipine significantly increased nitrite production from coronary microvessels in both normal and failing dog hearts. However, nitrite release was reduced after heart failure. For instance, the highest concentration of enalaprilat, thiorphan, and amlodipine increased nitrite release from 85 +/- 4 to 156 +/- 9, 82 +/- 7 to 139 +/- 8, and 74 +/- 4 to 134 +/-10 pmol/mg (all *p <.01 versus control), respectively, in normal dog hearts. Nitrite release in response to the highest concentration of these two inhibitors and amlodipine was reduced by 41% and 31% and 32% (all #p <.01 versus normal), respectively, in microvessels after heart failure. The increase in nitrite induced by either ACE or NEP inhibitors or amlodipine was entirely abolished by Nw-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, HOE 140 (a B2-kinin receptor antagonist), and dichloroisocoumarin (a serine protease inhibitor) in both groups. Our results indicate that: 1) there is an impaired endothelial NO production after pacing-induced heart failure; 2) both ACE and NEP are largely responsible for the metabolism of kinins and modulate canine coronary NO production in normal and failing heart; and 3) amlodipine releases NO even after heart failure and this may be partly responsible for the favorable effect of amlodipine in the treatment of heart failure. Thus, the restoration of reduced coronary vascular NO production may contribute to the beneficial effects of these agents in the treatment of heart failure.",

Infarct size was significantly larger in the cholesterol-fed versus normally fed rabbits. ACE activity in the ischemic and nonischemic myocardium was significantly reduced by quinapril. Chronic quinapril administration significantly ameliorated the increased myocardial injury in cholesterol-fed rabbits. Quinapril administration markedly increased the myocardial cGMP content and reduced the myeloperoxidase activity in the border region of the ischemic myocardium in cholesterol-fed rabbits. The enhanced expression of P-selectin in myocardial tissue of cholesterol-fed rabbits was also effectively reduced by quinapril treatment. The above effects of quinapril were eliminated by blockade of bradykinin B2 receptors or inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis.",

To determine whether tyrosine kinases and ERKs influence Ang II-stimulated responses, cells were pretreated with 10(-5) mol/L tyrphostin A-23 (tyrosine kinase inhibitor) and PD98059 (MEK inhibitor). Ang II-stimulated MEK activity was determined by tyrosine phosphorylation of ERKs. The angiotensin receptor subtypes (AT1 and AT2) were assessed with [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II (a nonselective subtype antagonist), losartan (a selective AT1 antagonist), and PD123319 (a selective AT2 antagonist). Ang II dose-dependently increased [Ca2+]i (pD2=8.4+/-0.36, Emax=541+/-55 nmol/L), pHi (pD2=9. 4+/-0.29, Emax=7.19+/-0.01), and contraction (pD2=9.2+/-0.21, Emax=36+/-2.2%). Ang II induced rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of ERKs, which was inhibited by PD98059.

    "560": "Proton-coupled peptide transporters mediate the absorption of a large variety of di- and tripeptides as well as peptide-like pharmacologically active compounds. We report a kinetic analysis of the rat kidney high-affinity peptide transporter PepT2 expressed in Xenopus oocytes. By use of simultaneous radioactive uptake and current measurements under voltage-clamp condition, the charge to substrate uptake ratio was found to be close to 2 for both D-Phe-L-Ala and D-Phe-L-Glu, indicating that the H+:substrate stoichiometry is 2:1 and 3:1 for neutral and anionic dipeptides, respectively. The higher stoichiometry for anionic peptides suggests that they are transported in the protonated form. For D-Phe-L-Lys, the charge:uptake ratio averaged 2.4 from pooled experiments, suggesting that Phe-Lys crosses the membrane via PepT2 either in its deprotonated (neutral) or its positively charged form, averaging a H+:Phe-Lys stoichiometry of 1.4:1. These findings led to the overall conclusion that PepT2 couples transport of one peptide molecule to two H+. This is in contrast to the low-affinity transporter PepT1 that couples transport of one peptide to one H+. Quinapril inhibited PepT2-mediated currents in presence or in absence of external substrates. Oocytes expressing PepT2 exhibited quinapril-sensitive outward currents. In the absence of external substrate, a quinapril-sensitive proton inward current (proton leak) was also observed which, together with the observed pH-dependent PepT2-specific presteady-state currents (Ipss), indicates that at least one H+ binds to the transporter prior to substrate. PepT2 exhibited Ipss in response to hyperpolarization at pH 6.5-8.0. However, contrary to previous observations on various transporters, 1) no significant currents were observed corresponding to voltage jumps returning from hyperpolarization, and 2) at reduced extracellular pH, no significant Ipss were observed in either direction. Together with observed lower substrate affinities and decreased PepT2-mediated currents at hyperpolarized Vm, our data are consistent with the concept that hyperpolarization exerts inactivation effects on the transporter which are enhanced by low pH. Our studies revealed distinct properties of PepT2, compared with PepT1 and other ion-coupled transporters.",

    "567": "In congestive heart failure (CHF), the neurohormonal mechanisms that cause renal vasoconstriction, particularly those depending on the renin-angiotensin system, could interfere with renal vasodilating mechanisms. To elucidate this issue, we studied the kidney response to an amino acid infusion (known to cause renal vasodilation in healthy individuals) in eight patients with CHF. We found that the amino acid infusion (0.7 mL/kg/h of a 10% solution) elicited no renal hemodynamic response, in marked contrast to healthy subjects. We next hypothesized that the renin-angiotensin system (known to be activated in heart failure) has a role in the lack of response to the amino acid infusion. To test this hypothesis, we repeated the study after two 5-mg doses of enalapril, an inhibitor of the angiotensin-converting enzyme, administered 12 hours apart. After enalapril treatment, the amino acid infusion caused a 45% increase in mean renal blood flow (RBF) from 383 +/- 55 to 557 +/- 51 mL/min at the fifth hour (P < 0.05). This normalization of the renal response to the amino acid infusion occurred without changes in cardiac output or in systemic vascular resistance. Hence, the renal fraction of the cardiac output increased during the amino acid infusion. The recovery of the renal vascular response was not accompanied by an increase in glomerular filtration rate (GFR; filtration fraction decreased), suggesting a predominant efferent arteriole dilatation. Our study shows that, in heart failure, the kidney loses its ability to increase RBF in response to an amino acid load. This lack of renal vascular response can be restored by inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system and is unrelated to changes in systemic hemodynamics.",

Studies using ACE inhibitors may also support this notion. Since a major portion of heart failure in the USA is caused by CAD, preventing CHF progression may be related to the prevention of CAD.

Defects in sarcoplasmic reticular and sarcolemmal calcium transport appear to be due to the accumulation of lipid metabolites in the membrane. Different agents, such as calcium-antagonists, beta-adrenoceptor blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, metabolic interventions and antioxidants, have been reported to exert beneficial effects in preventing subcellular remodeling and cardiac dysfunction in chronic diabetes. Clinical and experimental investigations have suggested that increased sympathetic activity, activated cardiac renin-angiotensin system, myocardial ischemia/functional hypoxia and elevated levels of glucose for a prolonged period, due to insulin deficiency, result in oxidative stress.

Within the first six months of captopril therapy mean systolic blood pressure decreased in microalbuminuric and macroalbuminuric patients from 168.1 +/- 17.6 mmHg to 134.4 +/- 12.1 mmHg (19.2 +/- 7.1%) and from 177.6 +/- 16.8 mmHg to 143.5 +/- 12.7 (18.9 +/- 6.7%) mmHg, respectively. Mean diastolic blood pressure, similarly, showed a decrease from 91.9 +/- 9.1 mmHg to 74.4 +/- 10.3 mmHg (19.0 +/- 9.4%) in the microalbuminuric and from 95.3 +/- 13.7 mmHg to 78.2 +/- 7.3 (16.9 +/- 9.5%) mmHg in the macroalbuminuric group. After six months of captopril administration albumin excretion rates decreased as well, from 97.4 +/- 35.9 micrograms/min to 51.9 +/- 19.9 micrograms/min (46.9 +/- 7.6%) and from 766.7 +/- 577.9 micrograms/min to 365.1 +/- 298.4 micrograms/min (50.4 +/- 8.4%) in the micro- and macroalbuminuric groups, respectively. Thereafter, mean albumin excretion rates and blood pressure rose significantly, but at the end of the fourth year they were still significantly lower compared to that of the pretreatment period. After four years, albumin excretion rates were 71.3 +/- 29.6 micrograms/min in the microalbuminuric and 391.2 +/- 204.7 micrograms/min in the macroalbuminuric group. We conclude that ACE inhibitor therapy results in a rapid decrease of albuminuria and blood pressure, and despite a slow gradual increase, the albumin excretion rates and blood pressure values remain significantly lower than the initial values after four years.", 
    "584": "Several lines of evidence point to an interrelation of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) with the endogenous fibrinolytic system. In the present study, we have therefore investigated the effect of the ACE-inhibitor captopril on various parameters of the fibrinolytic system in healthy volunteer subjects. 10 male subjects aged 28-38 years were given captopril 25 mg b.i.d. over 2 weeks. Venous blood was drawn before and at the end of the treatment period at 09.00 AM, after the volunteers had received their last dose of captopril by 07. 30 AM. Blood samples were processed for the determination of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). Both parameters were determined with respect to their abundance (as antigen concentrations) and function (activity). In addition, the concentration and activity of the von Willebrand factor were also determined. Two weeks of captopril treatment had no significant effect on any of the above mentioned parameters. Our results thus show that short-term treatment with the ACE-inhibitor captopril, at least in healthy subjects on an unrestricted NaCl intake, does not affect the fibrinolytic balance between t-PA and PAI-1 or the von Willebrand factor.",

This study evaluated the impact of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (captopril) therapy in these patients in the early postoperative period.", 
    "586": "During a 5-year period, 298 patients with prolonged diminished cardiac output required support (> 48 to 72 hours) with IABP plus two or three inotropes. This cohort was randomized to two groups, group A (195 patients) who were continued on IABP and inotropes alone and group B (103 patients) who were given an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, captopril 48 to 72 hours postoperatively and continued on IABP and inotropes.",

Peak improvement in tissue perfusion and hemodynamic parameters correlated with decreased serum angiotensin converting enzyme levels. Hospital mortality occurred in 31% of patients in group A and 14.5% in group B. Morbidity complications developed in 37% of patients in group A and 20% in group B. The average length of hospital stay in group A was 27 days and 17 days in group B. Cardiac, pulmonary, infective, gastrointestinal, renal, and neurological complications were common in both groups.", 
    "588": "Administration of ACE inhibitors in the early postoperative period to patients with severe postcardiotomy dysfunction caused improvement in tissue perfusion with decreases in mortality, morbidity, and length of hospital stay. These drugs, by effectively limiting physiological effects induced by renin angiotensin-aldosterone axis and other mechanisms, caused recovery of stunned myocardium. More randomized trials are needed before recommending these drugs for routine use in similar patients.", 
    "589": "Cardiac hypertrophy can be caused in different ways, and the effect of hypertrophy on prognosis depends on whether it is concentric or eccentric in nature. It is simplistic to ascribe hypertrophy purely to workload, and it is a complex interaction between workload, wall stress, and the local and humoral environment. In rats, acute elevation of BP occurring during the rats' sleep cycle causes cardiac hypertrophy, and reduction of BP in hypertensive rats during the sleep cycle causes reversal of left ventricular hypertrophy. This may be due to secretion of growth hormone and renin during sleep. Experimental evidence indicates that angiotensin II possibly formed and acting locally may be implicated in the genesis of cardiac hypertrophy; however, angiotensin II by itself causes relatively minor hypertrophy, but this becomes intensified if there is a high sodium intake and a high angiotensin II level. Blockade of the angiotensin system with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors causes reversal of cardiac hypertrophy and similar results are achieved with AT1 receptor blocking drugs, suggesting that bradykinin may be of relatively minor importance. Clinically, the AT1 receptor blocking drugs have few side effects and appear to have similar beneficial effects to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, making them suitable to treat many people with hypertension.", 
    "590": "Pharmacologic interruption of the renin-angiotensin system has played a crucial role in determining its contribution to physiology, pathophysiology, and has made an enormous contribution to therapeutics. Despite this record of success, no pharmacologist would have chosen the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) step for pharmacologic blockade. As renin is rate-limiting in the cascade and has remarkable specificity for its substrate, renin inhibition would have made a far more attractive target. Indeed, evidence reviewed in this article supports this case. A renin inhibitor developed to block rat renin produced a larger reduction in plasma angiotensin II concentration than did two ACE inhibitors at the top of their dose-response relationship. In humans, renin inhibition led to a larger increase in renal plasma flow in healthy human volunteers studied on a low salt diet to activate the renin system than did ACE inhibitors. Again, the studies used doses in each case at the top of the dose-response relationships for renal hemodynamics. Because the response to AT1 receptor blockade was very similar to the response induced by renin inhibitors, the results suggest that both classes of agent acted via their influence on the renin system. Moreover, the data suggest that 30 to 40% of angiotensin II formation influencing the kidney in the healthy human during renin system activation is formed via renin-dependent, but ACE-independent, pathways. These findings have potentially important therapeutic implications, and certainly help to justify the major therapeutic trials now ongoing and planned.", 
    "591": "The development of progressive glomerulosclerosis (GS) has been attributed to a number of humoral and hemodynamic factors, however, neither the exact pathomechanism nor the prevention and treatment have been clearly established. Renin-angiotensin system (RAS), interleukin-2 (IL-2)-activated T cells, systemic BP, and serum lipid levels all have been recognized as pathogenetic factors. According to our working hypothesis, a combination therapy with the inhibition of RAS and IL-2 system may be more potent in the prevention of the progression of GS than a monotherapy. After 5/6 subtotal nephrectomy, rats were treated with either the angiotensin-converting enzyme-blocker enalapril (E), the angiotensin II AT1 receptor blocker candesartan cilexetil (CA), the IL-2 synthesis inhibitor tacrolimus (T), or a combination of these agents. Proteinuria, as a functional hallmark of GS, was determined regularly, and at week 16, systolic BP, plasma total cholesterol, and triglyceride (TG) levels were measured and kidneys were harvested for morphologic and immunohistochemical analysis. Combination therapy was more effective (proteinuria: CA + T: 29.3+/-12.8 mg/24 h, E + T: 31.3+/-13.0 mg/24 h; GS: CA + T: 10.7+/-4.1%, E + T: 8.3+/-4.6%, P < 0.01) than monotherapy (proteinuria: T: 49.3+/-17.3 mg/24 h, CA: 53.2+/-18.1 mg/24 h, E: 51.1+/-26.6 mg/24 h; GS: T: 10.9+/-4.4%, CA: 23.8+/-4%, E: 14.2+/-5.3%, P < 0.05, with control values of proteinuria: 77.6+/-27.1 mg/24 h and GS: 28+/-2.9%). The number of infiltrating ED-1 (rat macrophage marker) macrophages (T: 161.5+/-51.2 cells/field of view, CA: 203.6+/-102.3, E: 178.6+/-35.3, CA + T: 140.2+/-63.2, E + T:128.2+/-75.6), and CD-5+ (rat T cell marker) T lymphocytes (CA + T: 261.5+/-103.6, E + T: 236+/-94.8) was significantly reduced by the treatment protocols (controls: ED-1: 356+/-100, CD-5: 482.9+/-154.5). These results indicate that an inhibition of RAS either with angiotensin-converting enzyme or AT1 receptor blockade, together with the inhibition of IL-2 synthesis, is more effective in the prevention of GS than a single treatment alone.", 
    "592": "Recent studies have demonstrated fenestrations in the juxtaglomerular part of the afferent arteriole facing the extraglomerular mesangium and the epithelioid cells in different mammals including humans. The permeability of the endothelium in afferent arteriole may play an important role in various physiologic and pathophysiologic processes. This study therefore was conducted to examine the permeability along the length of afferent arteriole using ferritin particles as an indicator of permeability/fenestration. Assuming the presence of a relationship between the development of permeable endothelial fenestration and renin formation, the permeability of the endothelium and renin granulation and their correlation along the wall of the afferent arteriole under control conditions and during inhibition of renin-angiotensin system by converting enzyme inhibition or AT1 receptor blockade were examined. The intra-aortically administered ferritin particles appeared in the interstitium of the distal part of the afferent arterioles. About one-third to half of the length of the afferent arteriole wall was ferritin-positive. There was a correlation between ferritin-positive and renin-positive portions. The density of ferritin particles was high close to the glomerulus and decreased continuously, similar to the profile of renin distribution. There was also a correlation between ferritin density in basal membrane and the renin granulation index. On the basis of these results, the afferent arteriole, according to its endothelial permeability, can be divided into two distinct portions, i.e., the permeable and the nonpermeable, the length and ratio of which may be related to the actual renin formation. These portions not only are different in the presence or absence of fenestration of the endothelium, but they also show difference in myosin and renin contents, suggesting that each portion may serve different function(s).", 
    "593": "This study aimed to assess and to compare the effects of cadesartan cilexetil on the renin system in rats. Male Sprague Dawley rats were orally treated either with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril (7.5 mg/kg per d), with the established AngII-AT1 receptor blocker losartan (40 mg/kg per d), or with candesartan cilexetil (1 mg/kg per d) for 3 d, and the effects of these treatments on plasma renin activity, renal renin mRNA levels, and adrenal levels of AngII-AT1a and AngII-AT1b receptor mRNA were determined. It was found that all drugs led to very similar increases in plasma renin activity and renin mRNA levels and to rather similar decreases in adrenal AngII-AT1b receptor mRNA levels. It is concluded therefore that the effects of candesartan on the renin system in vivo are not different from those obtained with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition or with the AngII-AT1 receptor blocker losartan.", 
    "594": "Fibrosis impairs cardiac function. This project has determined the expression and deposition of collagens and fibronectin and cardiac function in the deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertensive rat after inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. DOCA-salt hypertension was induced in 8-wk-old male Wistar rats by uninephrectomy and administration of DOCA (25 mg every fourth day, subcutaneously) and 1% NaCl in the drinking water for 4 wk. Starting 2 wk after surgery, rats were given either oral captopril (100 mg/kg), oral candesartan cilexetil (2 mg/kg), or subcutaneous spironolactone (50 mg/kg) daily for 2 wk (reversal protocol). DOCA-salt rats failed to gain weight with markedly increased water intake and decreased food intake; drug treatment did not alter these parameters. Systolic BP increased from 116+/-5 mmHg in uninephrectomized rats to 179+/-7 mmHg in DOCA-salt rats and was not decreased by treatment (captopril 172+/-1 mmHg; candesartan 187+/-2 mmHg; spironolactone 178+/-3 mmHg). Captopril, candesartan, and spironolactone reversed the increased collagen I mRNA in DOCA-salt rats; only candesartan reversed the increased collagen III mRNA. Collagen IV mRNA was unchanged in DOCA-salt rats and following treatment. Total fibronectin mRNA increased without changing the proportion of fibronectin mRNA as the fetal isoforms EIIIA and EIIIB. Captopril, candesartan, and spironolactone reversed the increased deposition of perivascular and interstitial collagen in DOCA-salt rats; the increased cardiac fibronectin deposition was reversed by candesartan and spironolactone. Captopril, candesartan, and spironolactone also attenuated or reversed the increased diastolic stiffness and the increased dP/dt but not the increased rate-pressure products in DOCA-salt rat hearts. Thus, inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system reverses cardiac fibrosis in DOCA-salt rats and returns some indices of myocardial function to normal.", 
    "595": "The renin-angiotensin system is activated during myocardial ischemia, and local angiotensin II formation occurs in ischemic hearts. At least two angiotensin II receptor subtypes, the AT1 and the AT2 receptor, have been identified. The cardiovascular effects of angiotensin II have been attributed largely to activation of AT1 receptors. In ventricular preparations from normal rat and pig hearts, the density of AT1 receptors is higher than that of AT2 receptors, whereas data on the AT receptor subtype density and its distribution in human hearts remain controversial. AT1 receptor blockade increases coronary blood flow during ischemia in dogs and during reperfusion in rats, reduces the incidence of ischemia-related arrhythmias in rats and guinea pigs, limits infarct size in pigs, improves functional and metabolic recovery after myocardial ischemia, and attenuates ventricular remodeling post-myocardial infarction in rats. The potential mechanisms responsible for the cardioprotection by AT1 receptor blockade remain to be elucidated in detail, but appear to involve AT2 receptor activation and the subsequent action of bradykinin, prostaglandins, and/or nitric oxide. Patients under treatment with AT1 receptor blockers for indications such as hypertension and ventricular dilation after myocardial infarction are likely to have improved prognosis when suffering an acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "596": "The structure and function of the vessel wall are dependent on the balance of several counteracting forces, i.e., vasoconstricting versus vasodilating, growth-promoting versus growth-inhibiting, and proapoptotic versus antiapoptotic. In a normal healthy vessel, these factors are closely balanced. However, under pathophysiologic conditions this balance is upset, resulting in the development of vascular hypertrophy and the generation of vascular lesions. For example, during the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis, there is an imbalance in a number of these processes, resulting in a proatherogenic state. Similarly, processes involved in maintaining the structure and function of the cardiac wall are under tight control and, when the control is upset, can result in left ventricular hypertrophy, with subsequent decreases in cardiac function and the development of failure. Evidence suggests that angiotensin II (AngII), acting via a family of receptors, plays an important role in the regulation of structure and function in both the heart and vessel wall; under pathologic conditions, the ability of the heart and vessel wall to generate AngII is increased, because of increased angiotensin-converting enzyme expression. In this review, the potential role of AngII in the regulation of cardiac and vascular structure and function is discussed.", 
    "597": "This study was designed to explore the mechanisms mediating the expression of the type 1 angiotensin II (AngII) receptor (AT1) in neuronal and renal tissues. Four groups of rats were given 1% NaCl in water and subjected to the renal reduced mass protocol (RRM), RRM + ramipril (Ram, 10 mg/kg per d), RRM + candesartan (Can, 10 mg/kg per d), or sham surgery. After 12 d, mean arterial pressure (MAP) was significantly higher in RRM rats than in RRM + Ram, RRM + Can, and sham-operated rats. Northern blot analysis showed that renal AT1 receptor mRNA levels (AT1 mRNA/18 rRNA) were significantly decreased in RRM (1.08+/-0.05) and RRM + Ram (0.82+/-0.02) compared with sham-operated rats (1.38+/-0.06) and that candesartan treatment caused a further decrease in renal AT1 mRNA content (0.73+/-0.07) compared with RRM. In contrast, dorsal root ganglia AT1 receptor mRNA content was significantly decreased in RRM (0.52+/-0.06) compared with sham-operated rats (1.18+/-0.07), and this decrease was abolished by ramipril (1.40+/-0.13) and candesartan treatment (1.56+/-0.11). RIA showed that levels (ng/mg protein) of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in the dorsal root ganglia were significantly increased in RRM (1.60+/-0.11) but not in RRM + Ram (1.14+/-0.20) and RRM + Can (1.18+/-0.09), compared with sham-operated rats (0.94+/-0.05). Thus, RRM-induced downregulation of neuronal AT1 mRNA expression is mediated by AngII activation of the AT1 receptor, whereas an AT1-independent mechanism is operant in mediating renal AT1 gene expression. Furthermore, the inverse relationship between neuronal AT1 expression and CGRP content indicates that activation of the neuronal AT1 receptor inhibits CGRP synthesis in the dorsal root ganglia. The functional implications of these findings are discussed.", 
    "598": "This study aimed at determining risk factors for perioperative mortality for patients undergoing partial left ventriculectomy. Fourteen patients with end-stage congestive heart failure underwent partial ventriculectomy at our institution from February, 1995 to October, 1997. Mean age was 48+/-11 years, symptoms duration 44+/-34 months, New York Heart Association symptoms score 4+/-0, systolic blood pressure 97.69+/-20.06 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure 65.38+/-13.91 mmHg, heart rate 91+/-15 beats/min, furosemide daily dose 121.66+/-96.65 mg and captopril daily dose 68.75+/-76.76 mg. Seven (50%) patients needed inotropic support for hemodynamic stabilization. On echocardiography, left ventricular diastolic dimension was 81.71+/-11.92 mm. Left ventricular ejection fraction determined by radionuclide ventriculography or echocardiography was 16.71+/-5.13. At heart catheterization, mean right atrial pressure was 12.50+/-7.72 mmHg, mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 23.60+/-7.79 mmHg, and mean pulmonary artery pressure 34.10+/-12.81 mmHg. Twelve patients had idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and two patients had a globally dilated heart with single vessel coronary artery disease. Aneurysmectomy, mitral valve surgery or coronary artery bypass surgery were not performed in any patient. Four (28%) patients died: three in the operating theatre and one from low output syndrome 2 days after surgery. The proportion of patients operated on with cardiogenic shock was four (100%) in nonsurvivors and 0% in survivors (P=0.001). Inotropic support was necessary in three (30%) survivors and in four (100%) nonsurvivors (P=0.06). Thus, preoperative hemodynamic instability may be associated with perioperative mortality after partial left ventriculectomy.", 
    "599": "Sudden death accounts for about 35% of the mortality of cardiac failure and its incidence does not decrease with the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Non-sustained ventricular tachycardia on Holter monitoring, late ventricular potentials and tachycardia induced by programmed ventricular stimulation have no formal predictive value of sudden death, underlining the varied character of the mechanisms underlying sudden death during cardiac failure. Sustained ventricular tachycardia degenerating to ventricular fibrillation is only one of the rhythmic factors implicated together with inaugural ventricular fibrillation, bradyarrhythmias and electromechanical dissociation. The underlying cardiac disease plays a role in the initiation of the fatal arrhythmia. In coronary artery disease, recurrent acute ischaemia is the principal trigger factor in patients who often have triple vessel disease. This explains the fact that classic markers of arrhythmia in the post-infarction period, which are only the reflection of the arrhythmogenic substrate of ventricular tachycardia, usually due to reentry around the fibrous scar of the infarct, are not valid in patients with progressive ischaemic cardiomyopathy. The most effective antiarrhythmic treatment in this type of patient is the prevention of ischaemia, when possible. In primary dilated cardiomyopathy, the mechanism underlying sudden death could be different at each stage. In NYHA Stages I and II, ventricular tachyarrhythmias could play a major part in unexpected sudden death in patients whose stable haemodynamic status suggested a more prolonged survival. The value of an implantable defibrillator would seem to be proved in this group of patients, at least in secondary prevention. In Stages III and IV, ventricular arrhythmias only indicate the degree of ventricular dysfunction and sudden death may follow bradyarrhythmias and electromechanical dissociation due to the precarious haemodynamic status.", 
    "600": "Heart failure has long been considered to have a progressive downhill course leading inexorably to an early demise. This course often occurs silently, in the absence of any obvious cardiac insults. The reason for this is a combination of cell loss, myocyte dysfunction, impaired energetics, and pathologic remodeling of the chamber. Improved clinical outcome should result from strategies that reduce the biologic signals responsible for myocyte growth, dysfunction, and loss and chamber remodeling. Clinicians should no longer attempt to treat chronic heart failure with pharmacologic growth and remodeling process. In time, it may be possible for the clinician to view the treatment of heart failure largely as a matter of improving the biologic function of the myocardium.", 
    "601": "The changes that take place in the structure and form of the left ventricle have become closely related to increase in clinical events in patients with heart failure. These changes are included in the term remodeling and occur as a response to the initial loss of left ventricular muscle mass. The mechanisms that initiate and maintain this remodeling process have become of great importance since a variety of effective pharmacologic agents have become available. A more complete understanding of remodeling has the potential of preventing the progression of heart failure. This article considers the various aspects of left ventricular remodeling including the cardiomyocytes, the myocardial interstitium, the importance that apoptosis plays the remodeling process.", 
    "602": "Whey protein was digested with one of seven kinds of proteases at 37 degrees C (trypsin, proteinase K, actinase E, thermolysin, or papain) or at 25 degrees C (pepsin or chymotrypsin) for 24 h. The digested samples were assayed for the inhibitory activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme and for changes in the systolic blood pressure caused in spontaneously hypertensive rats after gastric intubation. The strongest depressive effect on the systolic blood pressure (-55 mm Hg) was observed at 6 h after gastric intubation of the whey protein that was digested by proteinase K. Finally, six peptides were chromatographically isolated from the proteinase K digest by a combination of hydrophobic reversed-phase HPLC and gel filtration. The amino acid sequences and their origins were clarified as follows: Val-Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly [beta-casein (CN); f 59-64], Gly-Lys-Pro (beta 2-microglobulin; f 18-20), Ile-Pro-Ala (beta-lactoglobulin; f 78-80), Phe-Pro (serum albumin; f 221-222; beta-CN, f 62-63, f 157-158, and f 205-206), Val-Tyr-Pro (beta-CN; f 59-61), and Thr-Pro-Val-Val-Val-Pro-Pro-Phe-Leu-Gln-Pro (beta-CN; f 80-90). Chemical synthesis of these six peptides confirmed that all peptides, except an undecapeptide, have antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats. The synthetic tripeptide Ile-Pro-Ala, originating from beta-lactoglobulin, showed the strongest antihypertensive activity (-31 mm Hg).",

The present study examined the effects of Captopril, Taurine, and alpha-Lipoic acid on the Pb-induced GSH depletion and lipid peroxide increase in the lenticular system. Captopril administration returned the GSH, cysteine (CYS), and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels to near normal. Following Taurine administration the GSH, CYS and MDA levels were intermediate between the control group and the Pb group levels. Alpha-Lipoic acid administration, however, only increased the CYS levels. No significant changes in oxidized glutathione (GSSG) levels were observed in any treatment group.", 
    "604": "The renal effects of acute hypoxemia and the ability of perindoprilat, a potent angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, to prevent these effects were assessed in 31 anesthetized and mechanically ventilated newborn (5 to 8 d of age) rabbits. Renal blood flow (RBF) and GFR were determined by the clearances of para-aminohippuric acid and inulin, respectively. Each animal acted as its own control. In eight normoxemic rabbits (group 1), the i.v. infusion of saline did not change renal and hemodynamic functions. In eight additional rabbits, acute hypoxemia (PaO2= 40 mm Hg) induced a significant decrease in mean blood pressure (-8+/-2%), RBF (-36+/-3%), and GFR (-31+/-3%) and an increase in renal vascular resistance (+50+/-12%). A third group of newborn animals (n=7) was used to determine the renal effects of perindoprilat administration (20 microg/kg) under normoxemic conditions. RBF significantly increased (+15+/-2%) and renal vascular resistance significantly decreased (-15+/-3%), whereas GFR, mean blood pressure, and filtration fraction did not change significantly. In group 4 (n=7), perindoprilat infusion completely prevented the hypoxemia-induced alterations in GFR and renal vascular resistance and partially prevented the fall in RBF. These results demonstrate that angiotensin II modulates the renal immature microcirculation and that inhibition of its formation effectively prevents the hypoxemia-induced decrease in GFR.",

When suspected, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-enhanced renal scintigraphy is usually one of the initial studies done to evaluate patients.

We report a case of a false-positive angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-enhanced radionuclide renogram in a 5-year-old boy with hypertension.",

Concentration-response curves to Bay K 8644 (from 0.1 nM to 1 microM), a selective agonist of L-type calcium channels, were obtained in single-pass perfused kidneys isolated from groups of eight untreated or perindopril-treated (3 mg/kg/day, p.o., from age 3 to 7 weeks) LH and low-BP (LL) control rats. In untreated rats, the negative logarithm of the molar concentration of Bay K 8644 required to produce a half-maximal effect (pD2) values for Bay K 8644 did not differ between the two strains, whereas the maximal RVR response was higher in LH than in LL kidneys (28.0+/-4.9 vs. 12.9+/-0.8 mm Hg/ml/min/g, respectively). Perindopril normalized BP and RVR in LH rats and suppressed the interstrain differences in the maximal RVR responses (11.4+/-0.6 vs. 10.5+/-1.2 mm Hg/ml/min/g in LH and LL rats, respectively). These results demonstrate that LH rats exhibit an increased maximal contractile response to Bay K 8644 compared with LL controls, and that this alteration is not a primary defect because it disappears after normalization of BP level.", 
    "610": "Chronic inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis has been shown to result in arterial hypertension and an important blunting of the pressure diuresis and natriuresis response (PDN). The mechanisms mediating these abnormalities are not completely understood. In the present study, the role of several antihypertensive drugs to ameliorate these alterations was evaluated. The PDN relationships have been evaluated in rats chronically (8 wk) treated with the NO synthesis inhibitor N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; 40 mg/kg per d in the drinking water). Appropriate groups of rats were simultaneously treated with the angiotensin II receptor blocker candesartan at a low (1.5 mg/kg per d) and high (2.5 mg/kg per d) dose, with the converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (60 mg/kg per d) and with the calcium channel blocker verapamil (100 mg/kg per d). Chronic treatment with L-NAME significantly elevated mean BP (163.6 +/- 6.5 mmHg versus 105.1 +/- 3.6 in controls), reduced GFR and renal blood flow (RBF), and shifted to the right the PDN responses. Chronic administration of low-dose candesartan, captopril, or verapamil prevented the arterial hypertension and improved renal hemodynamics, but these levels were not completely normalized. High-dose administration also improved renal hemodynamics but induced reduced BP below the levels of control animals. Despite the normalization of the elevated BP, the PDN responses of these hypertensive treated groups were not normalized, and the slopes of the respective diuretic or natriuretic responses were very similar to those of the hypertensive untreated rats. The results indicate that interruption or blockade of the renin-angiotensin system and calcium channel blockade are effective treatments for the NO-deficient arterial hypertension and renal vasoconstriction. However, the PDN responses are not normalized, and this finding suggests that the antihypertensive treatment is not enough to overcome the renal alterations associated with the chronic deficiency of NO.",

Patients were treated with delapril hydrochloride 30 mg/day po for 12 months. Blood samples and an echocardiogram were obtained before treatment and after 6 and 12 months of treatment. Blood pressure, PIIIP, and LVM significantly decreased associated with an increase in left ventricular fractional shortening and mean systolic and diastolic posterior wall velocity at 6 and 12 months of treatment. Positive correlations between PIIIP and LVM (r=0.49, p<0.005) and negative correlations between PIIIP and left ventricular fractional shortening (r=-0.31, p<0.05) were found. Delapril hydrochloride reduced PIIIP and LVM and improved cardiac function in hypertensive patients.",

    "617": "Long-term angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) resets pressure natriuresis and shifts the relationship between renal arterial pressure (RAP) and renal interstitial hydrostatic pressure (RIHP) to lower levels of arterial pressure. These effects persist after withdrawal of treatment. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of short- and long-term ACE inhibition on medullary blood flow (MBF). Enalapril (25 mg. kg-1. day-1 in drinking water) was given to male SHR from 4 to 14 wk of age. Four weeks after stopping treatment, we measured MBF over a wide range of RAP using laser-Doppler flowmetry in anesthetized rats. Additional rats, either untreated or previously treated for 10 wk, received 3-day enalapril treatment just before the experiment. MAP (mmHg +/- SE) was 178 +/- 6 (n = 8), 134 +/- 6 (n = 8), 138 +/- 5 (n = 9), and 111 +/- 6 mmHg (n = 9) for the untreated, 3 day, 10 wk, and 10 wk + 3 day groups, respectively. Total renal blood flow for the groups receiving 3-day treatment was significantly higher when compared with that in rats with an intact renin-angiotensin system. Three-day treatment had no effect on the relationship between RAP and RIHP, whereas that in rats receiving 10-wk treatment was shifted to lower levels of RAP by approximately 30 mmHg. Both 10-wk and 3-day treatment independently increased the slope of the RAP versus MBF relationship at values of RAP > 100 mmHg. The slopes in perfusion units/mmHg were 0.12 +/- 0.01 (n = 8), 0.26 +/- 0.01 (n = 8), 0.27 +/- 0.01 (n = 9), and 0.30 +/- 0.02 (n = 9) for the untreated, 3 day, 10 wk, and 10 wk + 3 day groups, respectively. These results indicate that the effect of short-term and the persistent effect of long-term enalapril alter renal medullary hemodynamics in a way that may contribute to the resetting of the pressure-natriuresis relationship in treated rats.", 
    "618": "We evaluated in rats the time course of changes in cardiac versus plasma ANG I and II postmyocardial infarction (MI) and the effects of nephrectomy and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on the early changes post-MI. Acute coronary artery ligation was induced in conscious rats using the two-stage model, and plasma and cardiac tissue were obtained shortly (6 h, 1 and 3 days) and chronically (1, 4, and 8-9 wk) after MI. In an additional group of rats, bilateral nephrectomy was performed 18 h before the coronary artery ligation, and samples were obtained at 6 h post-MI. Furthermore, in two additional groups of rats, treatment with enalapril and quinapril was started 3 days before the ligation, and samples were obtained at 1 or 3 days post-MI. In these groups of rats, plasma and left ventricular (LV) (infarct and infarct free) ANG I and II were measured by RIA after separation on HPLC. In control rats, plasma ANG I and II showed a clear increase at 6 h post-MI but subsequently only minor increases were observed. In contrast, LV ANG II showed major increases at 6 h and 1 day post-MI, which had returned to normal by 3 days in the infarct-free LV and after 1(-2) wk in the infarct LV. LV ANG I showed a more gradual increase and remained elevated in the infarct up to 8-9 wk. Nephrectomy preceding the MI lowered ANG I and II in plasma but enhanced their increases in the heart at 6 h post-MI. Both ACE inhibitors decreased plasma ANG II associated with large increases in plasma ANG I. They also inhibited the increases in LV ANG II in both the infarct and infarct-free LV at 1 and 3 days post-MI with however no significant increase in LV ANG I. In conclusion, induction of a MI in conscious rats leads to rapid and marked, but only short-lived, increases in cardiac tissue ANG II in both the infarct and infarct-free parts of the LV. Pretreatment with ACE inhibitors, but not nephrectomy, blocks this increase. Local production appears to play a major role in the increases in cardiac ANG II post-MI.", 
    "619": "We tested the hypothesis that activation of protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms in pressure-overload heart failure was prevented by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition, resulting in normalization of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) 2a and phospholamban protein levels and improvement in intracellular Ca2+ handling. Aortic-banded and control guinea pigs were given ramipril (5 mg. kg-1. day-1) or placebo for 8 wk. Ramipril-treated banded animals had lower left ventricular (LV) and lung weight, improved survival, increased isovolumic LV mechanics, and improved cardiomyocyte Ca2+ transients compared with placebo-treated banded animals. This was associated with maintenance of SERCA2a and phospholamban protein expression. Translocation of PKC-alpha and -epsilon was increased in placebo-treated banded guinea pigs compared with controls and was attenuated significantly by treatment with ramipril. We conclude that ACE inhibition attenuates PKC translocation and prevents downregulation of Ca2+ cycling protein expression in pressure-overload hypertrophy. This represents a mechanism for the beneficial effects of this therapy on LV function and survival in heart failure.", 
    "620": "During the last few years there has been a renewed interest in blood-pressure (BP)-induced kidney damage, owing to a progressive increase in the incidence and prevalence of hypertension and vascular diseases as a cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The need to prevent ESRD demands continued efforts so as to identify early those people with hypertension who are at risk and to provide them with effective antihypertensive therapy. This review analyses what is needed in terms of surrogate endpoints for monitoring kidney damage and what is known about the impact of antihypertensive treatments in reducing the BP burden on the kidney in non-diabetic subjects. Although glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and proteinuria are useful surrogate endpoints for patients with nephropathy and GFR below or close to the threshold value for renal insufficiency, it is clear that monitoring changes in either GFR or proteinuria does not provide a sensitive endpoint for subjects with the mildest forms of renal disease, e.g. essential hypertensive patients who are at risk of developing kidney damage. In this case microalbuminuria may be useful, although unequivocal evidence demonstrating that microalbuminuria is a risk marker for developing renal insufficiency in non-diabetic renal diseases has not existed until now, and whether a decrease in microalbuminuria is of prognostic significance in patients with essential hypertension remains to be demonstrated. The beneficial effects of the antihypertensive agents on microalbuminuria are also proportional to BP reduction. If a large enough BP reduction is achieved there seem to be, at most, only minimal differences among the antihypertensive drug classes. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers have additional beneficial effects on microalbuminuria independent of the BP reduction, owing to their direct role in glomerular haemodynamics. The heterogeneity in the changes in urinary albumin excretion during antihypertensive treatment may be related to the different factors involved in the presence of microalbuminuria or structural end-organ damage, or both.", 
    "621": "Previous analysis of the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) gene in this laboratory showed that primary mesangial cells in culture are able to express ACE mRNA. Moreover, ACE is produced as an ectoenzyme and as a secreted form of the enzyme, indicating a potential effect of local angiotensin II production on glomerular microcirculation. The aim of this study was to purify and characterize the secreted and intracellular ACE forms from mesangial cells in culture.", 
    "622": "Medium from Wistar rats mesangial cells was collected (third passage), incubated for 20 h with RPMI without fetal bovine serum and concentrated 29 times in an Amicon concentrator.

The mesangial cells were collected and ACE enzyme was extracted using Triton X-114, followed by centrifugation and concentration. The supernatant was submitted to the same chromatography as described above and two peaks with ACE activity (ACEInt1, mol. wt 130000 and ACEInt2, 68000) were separated. The purified ACE were inhibited by enalaprilat and captopril, two potent competitive inhibitors of ACE and by EDTA, using Hippuryl-His-Leu as a substrate. The Km values were 2 mM for ACE1 and ACE2 and 3 mM for ACEInt1 and ACEInt2. The enzymes ACE1 and ACE2 presented an optimum pH of 8.0 and ACEInt1 and ACEInt2 an optimum pH of 7.5.",

The ratios found for ACE1, ACE2, ACEInt1 and ACEInt2 in the present study were similar to those described above, suggesting that mesangial cells, besides showing the presence of intracellular ACE, are able to secret both full-length wild-type ACE and N-domain ACE. Thus, they may potentially have an effect, not only on bradykinin and angiotensin I (ACE wild-type), but also on substance P, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone and Met-enkephalin to interfere with glomerular haemodynamics and with the renal microcirculation.",

AM and PAMP were significantly correlated with PRA but not PAC in all patients. The AM and PAMP levels were not affected by the captopril loading with or without a hypotensive reaction. The AM and PAMP levels were increased only slightly despite the large increase in PAC induced in the PA patients by the renin-secretion stimulating and ACTH loading tests.",

The arterial 125I-angiotensin I levels in these studies may have been too low to result in detectable renal venous 125I-angiotensin II levels, especially in view of the extensive degradation of angiotensins in the kidney. To overcome this problem, we now infused 125I-angiotensin I directly into the renal artery.",

    "630": "At steady-state, the levels of 125I-angiotensin I in renal venous blood were 5-6 fold lower, and those of 125I-angiotensin II were 4-5 fold higher than in renal arterial blood. On the basis of these levels, angiotensin I extraction in the renal vascular bed was calculated to be 80+/-3%, of which 9+/-1% was due to angiotensin I-to-II conversion. The renal venous levels of endogenous angiotensin I were 50% higher than its arterial levels, whereas the levels of endogenous angiotensin II were 50% lower in renal venous blood than in arterial blood. Taking into consideration the regional metabolism of arterially delivered angiotensins, and the generation of angiotensin I in circulating blood by plasma renin activity, it could be calculated that renal venous angiotensin I is largely derived from renal tissue sites, and that renal venous angiotensin II has no other sources than arterially delivered angiotensin I and II and angiotensin I generated by plasma renin activity in the renal vascular bed.",

Conversion of angiotensin I generated at renal tissue sites does not contribute to the level of angiotensin II in the renal vein, although it is the main source of angiotensin II in renal tissue. Thus, the intrarenal formation of angiotensin II is highly compartmentalised.",

    "640": "The cardiovascular complications in hypertension are ascribed to two different but associated alterations, namely atherosclerosis and arteriosclerosis. Whereas the former disturbs principally the conduit function and the delivery of an adequate blood flow to peripheral organs and tissues, the latter disturbs the cushioning function of large arteries, inducing an inadequate increase in systolic and pulse pressure. Arteriosclerosis represents a clinical form of accelerated ageing process and is characterized by a diffuse dilation and hypertrophy of large conduit arteries and stiffening of arterial walls. Independently from the ageing, structural changes are associated with several haemodynamic alterations such as increased in blood flow and flow velocity, and increased parietal stress due to increased arterial diameters and/or intraarterial pressure. The principal consequences of arterial stiffening are: (1) an increased left ventricular afterload with development of left ventricular hypertrophy and increased myocardial oxygen demand; (2) altered coronary perfusion and blood flow distribution; and (3) decreased perfusion reserve during haemodynamic stress. In the absence of controlled studies, it is difficult to propose therapeutic interventions aimed to prevent or treat arterial abnormalities in hypertensive patients. It has been shown that long-term administration of either calcium channel blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors led to an improvement of vessel wall elasticity. Nevertheless, these studies did not conclude whether the improvement of elastic properties were due only to decrease in blood pressure or to alterations in intrinsic properties of arterial walls. More investigations should be necessary to investigate this important problem.", 
    "641": "1. Angiotensin (Ang) II modulates cardiovascular baroreflexes; whether or not the peptide influences chemosensitive cardiovascular reflexes is not known. We tested the hypothesis that Ang II modulates the reflex control of sympathetic nerve activity exerted by 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 (5HT3) cardiopulmonary receptors. 2. The 5HT3 receptor agonist phenylbiguanide (PBG), infused intravenously for 15 min, elicited a sustained reflex decrease of renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) but only transient (<3 min) changes of arterial blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) in methohexital-anaesthesized rats. 3. Infusion of Ang II at a dose that did not affect baseline BP, HR and RSNA enhanced the PBG-evoked reflex decrease of RSNA (-54+/-5% in Ang II treated versus -33+/-6% in control rats after 15 min PBG, P<0.05, n = 6 each) in methohexital-anaesthetized rats. 4. The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor lisinopril blunted the reflex responses to PBG in anaesthetized as well as conscious animals. The effect of the ACE inhibitor was abolished by concomitant infusion of Ang II. 5. The reflex response to stimulation of cardiopulmonary 5HT3 afferents was also impaired by the Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1) blocker ZD7155 but not by the type 2 (AT2) blocker PD 123319. 6. Infusion of a volume load to stimulate cardiopulmonary baroreceptors induced a gradual decrease of RSNA which was impaired by exogenous Ang II (RSNA -26+/-6% in Ang II treated versus -47+/-6% in control rats after volume load, P<0.05, n = 6 each) but unaffected by ACE inhibition. 7. The reflex control of RSNA by cardiopulmonary 5HT3 receptors is enhanced by Ang II via AT1 receptors. Thus, Ang II facilitates a chemosensitive cardiovascular reflex, in contrast to its inhibitory influences on mechanosensitive reflexes.",

    "645": "Heart failure is a common clinical problem in patients with cardiovascular disease. Mortality remains high despite conventional therapy. The morbidity associated with heart failure accounts for numerous hospitalizations and significant health care expenditures. Therapy has been directed at relieving symptoms, augmenting exercise capacity, reducing hospitalizations and improving survival. Randomized clinical trials have shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors achieve these therapeutic goals and exert a favourable influence on disease progression. Recent clinical trials evaluating metoprolol, bisoprolol and carvedilol have clearly established that judicious use of beta-adrenergic blockers in heart failure patients who have been stabilized favourably influences the natural history of the disease, even when given as additional therapy to patients already receiving ACE inhibitors. Carvedilol is a non-selective beta-adrenergic blocking drug with vasodilatory properties that has been recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in patients with NYHA functional class II or III heart failure. It was the only agent to produce a statistically significant survival benefit in a pre-specified analysis that included all the patients randomized into the multicentre U.S. Carvedilol Heart Failure Trials Program, irrespective of disease aetiology. As with trials looking at ACE inhibitor therapy, studies involving beta-blocker therapy in patients with heart failure have evaluated the effects of these drugs on hospitalization, NYHA functional class, exercise capacity and survival. In the U.S. Carvedilol Heart Failure Trials Program, the risk of hospitalization for any cause was reduced by 29%, the risk of hospitalization for a cardiovascular cause was reduced by 28% and the risk of dying was reduced by 65%. Thus, carvedilol has been shown in randomized clinical trials to improve the quantity of life and, at least in terms of the incidence of hospitalization, to improve the qualify of life as well. Randomized trials have consistently reported a favourable change in NYHA functional class in patients treated with beta-adrenergic blocking drugs: the majority of patients became less symptomatic. In the U.S. Carvedilol trials, patients and physicians reported (separately) an improvement in global status, and less deterioration when treatment was randomized to carvedilol. The positive influence of such therapy is reflected in a reduction in hospitalizations. In summary, patients with NYHA class II or III who have been stabilized with ACE inhibitors and diuretics can expect an improvement in the quality as well as the quantity of life with beta-blocker therapy.",

Better treatments for and earlier detection of heart failure are needed if the situation to improve. However, even this may not be enough. The dramatic deterioration in quality of life and prognosis when a patient progresses from asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction to overt heart failure suggests that only a programme of screening and prevention will effectively reduce the public health burden of heart failure. Moreover, the economic consequences of developing overt heart failure suggest that such an approach is likely to be cost-effective.",

In France, three-quarters of the medical cost of congestive heart failure, i.e. FF7 billion, is attributed to 150000 annual hospital admissions. But new treatments, especially ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers, have demonstrated, through large controlled trials (SAVE, AIRE, US trials on carvedilol and CIBIS I) that these drugs can reduce mortality and hospitalization. These results, translated in terms of cost per life year saved, show that they are all very cost effective and could be cost saving, under some conditions.", 
    "648": "We performed a retrospective study on 26 patients with moderate renal failure (mean GFR = 51 +/- 21 ml min-1 1.73 m-2), hypertension and atherosclerosis. Apart from three patients who had completely normal renal Doppler ultrasonography, all patients underwent renal angiography. Three groups of kidneys with different atherosclerotic renal artery involvement were identified: Group 1, 24 kidneys with no renal artery stenosis (RAS); Group 2, 18 kidneys with mild (> 25% and < 50% diameter) RAS; and Group 3, 10 kidneys with moderate (> 50% diameter) RAS. We used a two-day protocol with frusemide plus enalapril 99Tcm-MAG3 scintigraphy. The mean parenchymal transit time (MPTT), time to the maximum activity (time to peak) of the renal curve (Tmax), residual activity and split renal uptake were evaluated. The measured parameters did not differ before and after enalapril in Group 1 or in Group 2. In Group 3, MPTT and residual activity differed significantly (P < 0.025) before and after enalapril. The Tmax before and after enalapril, MPTT before and after enalapril and residual activity after enalapril differed significantly (P < 0.05) between Groups 1 and 3 and between Groups 2 and 3. Threshold values were obtained to maximize diagnostic accuracy. The Tmax, MPTT and residual activity after enalapril gave satisfactory results, and MPTT performed best with a 75% positive predictive value and a 98% negative predictive value for the diagnosis of renal artery stenosis. We conclude that MPTT, measured after enalapril administration, is a useful parameter to detect renal artery stenosis in patients with hypertension, atherosclerosis and moderate renal insufficiency.", 
    "649": "The beneficial effect of ACE inhibitors on cardiovascular remodelling from hypertension and ischemic disease may be due to the effect of these drugs on the proliferation/cell death balance. We therefore investigated the effect of the addition of captopril in vitro, on the onset of apoptosis in human vascular myocytes, by using a propidium iodide fluorescence analysis and a morphological analysis using the acridine orange technique. Captopril (0.23 mM) caused an increase in apoptotic phenomena that was more than 3. 5-fold than in controls both at the 24th (7.7 vs. 2%) and the 48th h (10.1 vs. 3.8%). The addition of propranolol strengthened the effect on apoptosis. The induction of apoptotic phenomena may be a mechanism by which ACE inhibitors affect cardiovascular remodelling and it might also explain the favorable effect these drugs have on diseases such as IgA nephropathy and diabetic nephropathy.",

    "651": "Hypertension is a very common condition among recipients of transplanted organs, and is often related to immunosuppressive therapy. In many transplant centres, calcium antagonists are often used as first-line antihypertensive drug therapy, not only because of efficacy in lowering blood pressure, but also because certain members of the class have a 'beneficial' drug-drug interaction with cyclosporin, which decreases the cost of administering this very expensive immunosuppressant. Diuretics are often used both for blood pressure and volume control, and some centres have used either alpha-beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and even beta-blockers with success in certain patients. The high frequency of perceived adverse effects of antihypertensive drugs in transplant recipients and the diversity of training of the specialist physicians involved in their care makes choice of traditional antihypertensive drug therapy in these patients a major challenge.",

Established nephropathy is preceded by a long silent phase of incipient nephropathy characterized by a subclinical increase in albumin excretion know as microalbuminuria (30-300 mg/d). There is evidence that the progression of nephropathy and its associated mortality can be ameliorated by a number of interventions if started at a nearly stage: glycaemic control, that should be optimized as far as possible, and hypertension control. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are promoted as first-line agent for treating hypertension in diabetic patients; as well as their systemic hypotensive action, these drugs may have an additional beneficial effect in reducing intraglomerular pressure.",

This study was designed to examine the effect of Ac-SDKP on the contractions to angiotensin I. Experiments were performed on rat aortic rings with endothelium exposed to nitro-L-arginine. Ac-SDKP (10 and 100 microM) significantly augmented angiotensin I ED20 (from 2.0+/-0.4 to 4.2+/-1.0 and 5.0+/-0.9 nM) and ED50 (from 4.3+/-0.7 to 8.6+/-1.0 and 10.7+/-1.3 nM, respectively), but did not alter its maximal response. The contractions to angiotensin II were not affected by Ac-SDKP. No degradation of exogenous Ac-SDKP nor detectable release of endogenous Ac-SDKP were observed in the incubation medium. These results suggest that Ac-SDKP impairs angiotensin I response by inhibiting ACE and subsequent angiotensin II formation.", 
    "654": "A prospective study to evaluate and compare the cardiorespiratory effects and clinical efficacy of the Neurohormonal inhibitors (Captopril 50 mg+prazosin 1 mg only) and direct arteriolar and venular dilators (Intravenous hydralazine 30 mg+oral isosorbide dinitrate 30 mg) used as vasodilator therapy, was undertaken in a randomized, single blind study in 17 Nigerian patients with hypertensive acute left ventricular failure. Both vasodilator regimes separately and significantly reduced the systolic and diastolic blood pressures (P<0.001 ANOVA), heart rate (P<0.001 ANOVA), and the respiratory rate (P<0.05 ANOVA), the double product, but increased the peak expiratory flow rate (P<0.05 ANOVA). However, the neurohormonal antagonists, captopril and prazosin (n=9) caused a statistically significantly greater reduction in heart rate (P<0.05 ANOVA) respiratory rate (P<0.05 ANOVA) and induced a significantly greater increase in the self-paced exercise capacity, 24 h after initiation of treatment, (P<0.02) compared to the hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate combination (n=8). Five of the nine patients on the neurohormonal antagonist therapy were ambulant at 24 h, compared to none of the eight patients receiving conventional venular and arteriolar dilators hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate (chi2=5.84 dfi P<0.05). There was a significant inverse correlation between the systolic blood pressure heart rate product, and the distance covered during symptom limited self paced exercise capacity (r=-0.58, P=0.0146 ANOVA). One of eight patients in the hydralazine+isosorbide nitrate combination died, but there was no mortality in the captopril+prazosin group. These findings collectively suggest that captopril+prazosin combination may be a superior vasodilator therapy compared to hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate, in hypertensive acute pulmonary oedema.", 
    "655": "This study examined the effect of enalapril on survival, resource use, and cost of care in patients with left ventricular dysfunction and hypertension using a retrospective analysis of patients who participated in the Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD). Among the 6797 SOLVD participants, 1917 patients had either elevated systolic (> or = 140 mm Hg) or diastolic (> or = 90 mm Hg) blood pressure. Therapy with enalapril was associated with a significant relative risk reduction for mortality (RR = 0.819, 95% CI: 0.68 to 0.98; P = .03). This resulted in a gain of 0.11 years (95% CI: 0.00 to 0.20 years) of survival during the average 2.8 year follow-up for this subgroup and was projected to result in a gain of 2.14 years (95% CI: 0.05 to 4.21 years) during the patient's lifetime. Enalapril significantly reduced the risk of first hospitalization for heart failure by 37%. For all types of hospitalizations, there was an average reduction of 32 hospitalizations per 100 patients treated with enalapril during the trial period (95% CI: 11.8 to 52.2 hospitalizations avoided per 100 patients), resulting in an estimated net savings of $1656 per patient during the trial period (95% CI: increased cost of $191 to savings of $3502). Although the projected lifetime net savings of $1456 was not significant (95% CI: increased cost of $9243 to saving of $12,527), evaluation of the cost per life year saved indicated that enalapril represented a cost-effective strategy. The estimated clinical benefit of enalapril among the hypertensive subgroup in SOLVD supports the recommendation that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors should be considered as first line pharmacologic therapy for hypertensive patients with left ventricular dysfunction. From both the clinical and economic viewpoints, ACE inhibitors provide important clinical benefits and are cost-effective.", 
    "656": "Evidence derived from in vivo experimental studies performed with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) indicates that these agents are capable of modulating the process of cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. The antifibrotic actions of ACEi are thought to be derived from their capacity to block the production of angiotensin II and, thus, its action on the cardiac fibroblast. However, in contrast to rat hearts, human myocardium has low levels of angiotensin II receptors. Evidence indicates that enhanced bradykinin (BK) levels result from the action of ACEi. In vivo data derived from the use of the BK blocker HOE140 suggests a role for BK in repressing the process of cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. Little is known as to the abundance of angiotensin II and BK receptors in human cardiac fibroblasts. Data presented in this study indicates that in cultured human cardiac fibroblasts there is apparently few angiotensin II receptors whereas as in other species there is evidence for the presence of BK receptors. Further studies need to be performed to establish the potential role that BK plays in modulating human cardiac fibroblast function.", 
    "657": "Telmisartan is a nonpeptide angiotensin II receptor antagonist which selectively and insurmountably inhibits the angiotensin II AT1 receptor subtype without affecting other receptor systems involved in cardiovascular regulation. Oral telmisartan dose-dependently reduced blood pressure (BP) in various animal models of hypertension. In transgenic rats, telmisartan reduced cardiac hypertrophy and glomerulosclerosis. When administered at dosages of 40 to 160 mg once daily to patients with mild to moderate hypertension, telmisartan significantly reduced systolic and diastolic BP compared with placebo and was at least as effective as atenolol 50 or 100 mg and lisinopril 10 to 40 mg. One study showed telmisartan 80 mg/day to be more effective than enalapril 20 mg/day. In 2 studies that used ambulatory BP monitoring, once daily telmisartan provided better control of diastolic BP for the full dosing interval than losartan potassium 50 mg or amlodipine 5 or 10 mg. In a single study in patients with severe hypertension, a telmisartan-based regimen had antihypertensive efficacy similar to that of an enalapril-based regimen. Telmisartan had a tolerability profile similar to that of placebo in clinical studies.",

A prequalification washout period (antihypertensive medications withdrawn) and a 2-week qualification period (patients received single-blind placebo) preceded a 10-week, double-blind treatment period. The patients received either 50 mg tasosartan (n = 132) or placebo (n = 130) once per day and were evaluated once per week. The dose of tasosartan was increased at 3-week intervals to 100 mg and then to 200 mg if the mean sitting diastolic blood pressure (SiDBP) exceeded 90 mm Hg. Compared with placebo, tasosartan produced significantly (P <.05) greater reductions in both SiDBP (-9.4 +/- 0.7 vs -2.0 +/- 0.7 mm Hg) and sitting systolic blood pressure (SBP) (-12.2 +/- 1.2 vs +0.4 +/- 1.2 mm Hg). The rate of response (SiDBP </=90 mm Hg or a decrease from baseline of >/=10 mm Hg) was significantly (P <.05) greater in the tasosartan group than in the placebo group (55% vs 19%). The mean 24-hour blood pressure reduction with tasosartan was -12.6 +/- 0. 9/-8.1 +/- 0.6, significantly greater (P <.05) than the reduction with placebo (+0.6 +/- 0.9/+0.5 +/- 0.6 mm Hg). The trough-to-peak ratio (determined from the ambulatory data) was 0.66 for DBP and 0. 72 for SBP for the tasosartan treatment group, demonstrating 24-hour efficacy with once-a-day administration. The safety profile of tasosartan was similar to placebo.",

Little is known about the extent to which physicians who design and/or implement clinical trials differ from physicians in routine practice in their translation of the literature.", 
    "662": "Our aims were to (1) evaluate recent trends in selected treatments of AMI in relation to the publication of RCTs, statistical overviews, and task-force guidelines, and (2) compare prescribing practices in AMI management between physicians in routine clinical practice and physicians who design and/or implement RCTs. We reviewed the use of aspirin, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers on entry and at discharge in patients enrolled in the MILIS, TIMI 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 9B trials with ST-elevation (and depression in MILIS) myocardial infarction for a period approaching 2 decades (August 1978 to September 1995). We hypothesized that physicians who participate in RCTs apply the findings of the published literature more promptly and thoroughly than physicians in routine practice.", 
    "663": "Use of aspirin, beta-blockers, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors exhibited a statistically significant time-related increase at discharge and, excepting beta-blockers, at enrollment across the trials. Prescription of calcium channel blockers showed a statistically significant decrease at discharge only. For all medications under study, increases and decreases in use associated with publication of clinical data occurred earlier and more steeply for the discharge cohort (prescriptions by physicians participating in RCTs) than for the enrollment cohort (prescriptions by physicians in routine practice). Recent prescribing practices (1994 to 1995) among RCT investigators and their colleagues have higher concordance with published findings than those of physicians in routine practice.",

    "666": "All consecutive patients admitted within 48 hours for confirmed acute myocardial infarction to the participating centers in November 1995 were included. For each patient, baseline parameters, as well as clinical course and therapeutic treatment during the first 5 days, were collected. For the purpose of this study, the diagnosis of heart failure required a left ventricular ejection fraction </=35% and/or a Killip class >1. During the 1-year follow-up, date and cause of death were recorded. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were analyzed with the log rank test. Cox multivariate analyses were used to assess the independent prognostic factors among 5-day survivors. Eight hundred twenty-one (38%) patients exhibited heart failure during the first 5 days after myocardial infarction. Patients with heart failure were 10 years older and were more likely to be hypertensive or diabetic; use of primary revascularization (33% vs 47%, P <.001) and beta-blockers (40% vs 79%, P <.001) was less frequent, whereas prescription of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors was enhanced (56% vs 41%, P <.001). Mortality rate was strongly related to both left ventricular ejection fraction (P <. 001) and Killip class (P <.001). One-year mortality rate was 39.7% in patients with heart failure compared with 7.1% in patients without heart failure (P <.001). A significant reduction in mortality rates was observed with beta-blockers (risk ratio 0.63 [0. 45 to 0.89], P =.01) and ACE inhibitors (risk ratio 0.73 [0.54 to 0. 99], P =.04). It was more pronounced in patients with heart failure.",

Patients with heart failure after acute myocardial infarction constitute a high-risk group. They appear to derive a greater benefit from treatment with both beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors than from each class on its own.", 
    "668": "The effect of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, lisinopril, on gonadal hormones was assessed in 20 patients with essential hypertension. A daily dose of 5 to 20 mg of lisinopril was administered for 6 mo. In male patients, the free testosterone (f-T) concentration decreased significantly (before, 13.8+/-2.4 pg/ml; after, 9.9+/-1.5 pg/ml: mean +/- SEM, p < 0.05), whereas the plasma total testosterone (T), estradiol (E2), and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) concentrations were not significantly affected. Lisinopril had no effect on plasma T, f-T, or E2 concentrations in female patients, but significantly increased the plasma SHBG concentration (before, 48.0 6.1 nmol/l; after, 62.7+/-6.7 nmol/l: p < 0.01). The results of this preliminary study suggest that lisinopril affects plasma f-T and SHBG concentrations. The clinical implications of lisinopril-induced changes in plasma f-T and SHBG concentrations remain to be clarified.",

Male Wistar rats were given distilled water (control), NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) 500 mg/l, or L-NAME plus imidapril 10 mg/l in the drinking water. In rats treated with L-NAME 500 mg/l plus T-0115, T-0115 was given in the food at a dose of 0.2 mg/g food or 0.6 mg/g food. We then collected 24-h urine samples at 2, 4, and 6 wk, obtained blood samples at 6 wk, and histologically examined the kidney and heart. L-NAME markedly reduced the levels of NO metabolites in serum and urine while increasing the tail-cuff blood pressure, the urinary albumin level (1.90+/-0.65 vs. 0.05+/-0.02 mg/d/100 g in control), and the area of the left ventricular wall (83.3+/-3.0 vs. 69.8+/-1.8 mm2 in control). The plasma renin activity was significantly higher in rats treated with L-NAME than in the control rats. The concomitant administration of T-0115 0.6 mg/g food with L-NAME ameliorated the tail-cuff pressure and the albuminuria (0.56+/-0.23 mg/d/100 g), although to a lesser extent than the changes seen with imidapril 10 mg/l. T-0115 0.6 mg/g food prevented left ventricular hypertrophy as effectively as imidapril 10 mg/l (70.8+/-1.8 with T-0115 vs. 68.3+/-2.7 mm2 with imidapril). Chronic inhibition of NO synthesis produced left ventricular hypertrophy and nephrosclerosis. Our results demonstrate that inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system morely effectively prevents nephrosclerosis than does the blockade of ETA receptors in a model of hypertension induced by chronic NO blockade. However, inhibition of the ET-1 pathway appeared to be as effective as ACE inhibitors in preventing left ventricular hypertrophy in this model.", 
    "670": "Recently, we have shown that chronic administration of N-Nitro-L-Arginine Methyl Ester (L-NAME, an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase) precipitates stroke in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP). Enalapril maleate, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor was shown to delay the onset of such stroke. In the present study, five groups of 4-week-old SHRSP were used. Three groups of SHRSP were made diabetic using streptozotocin (100 mg/kg i.p.). One week later, the SHRSP from groups I (non-diabetic) and III (diabetic) chronically received L-NAME (0.5 g/L) in saline as drinking water. Two SHRSP groups, II (non-diabetic) and IV (diabetic) received L-NAME (0.5 g/L) and enalapril maleate (20 mg/L) in saline as drinking water. Control SHRSP (group C; diabetic) received only saline to drink. SHRSP groups I and III developed stroke in 10+/-2 and 11+/-2 days, respectively. The average stroke-free period in groups II and IV was 19+/-2 and 28+/-2 days, respectively. Protective effect of streptozotocin-induced diabetes disappeared when SHRSP drinking L-NAME and enalapril, concurrently received subcutaneous injections of insulin (2 units daily per 100 g rat). Present data suggest that experimental diabetes delays the onset of L-NAME-induced stroke in SHRSP only in the absence of angiotensin converting enzyme activity. In addition, diabetes-induced enhancement of stroke-protective effect of enalapril appears to be independent of reduction in mean and systolic blood pressures.",

The microcapsules prepared by this method were irregular in shape. Particle size of the microcapsules was between 60 and 500 microns. The efficiency of encapsulation for all four drugs was more than 40% at 20% drug loading. The encapsulation increased up to 75% or higher when the drug loading was reduced to 5%. The in vitro dissolution was drug dependent. The microcapsules prepared with 5% drug loading showed the minimum dissolution at the end of 24 hr. The initial drug release increased significantly when the drug loading was increased up to 20%.

The cyclic GMP analog, 8-Br-cGMP and the cyclic GMP specific phosphodiesterase inhibitor, zaprinast, both increased ACE. Increase of ACE was also caused by nonspecific phosphodiesterase inhibitors, dipyridamole and IBMX. Intracellular cGMP levels were shown to increase by ANP, and phosphodiesterase inhibitors.",

Sham-operated and infarcted rats were treated with captopril (12 mg/kg.d s.c.) from either day 0-21 (early) or day 21-35 (late) after surgery. In isolated retrogradely perfused rat hearts, maximal coronary flow was determined following maximal dilatation with nitroprusside and adenosine (1 mM each). In separate groups, sections of hearts of sham-operated and MI rats treated with BrdU (day 7-14) and either captopril or perindoprilat (1 mg/kg.d s.c.; day 0-14) were double stained with a monoclonal anti-BrdU antibody and the lectin GSI.

The total fraction of DNA synthesizing cells was significantly increased in MI hearts (sham: 7.6 +/- 1.9; MI: 14.9 +/- 2.2%). The proportion of endothelial cells, however, was comparable in sham-operated and infarcted hearts (sham: 30 +/- 3; MI: 33 +/- 3%). Both early captopril and perindoprilat treatment inhibited total DNA synthesis in MI hearts.

Dahl/S rats fed on a normal sodium diet spontaneously developed nephrosis and mild hypertension from a young age. In young Dahl/S rats, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, imidapril, attenuated the development of proteinuria accompanied by a decrease in blood pressure. Methylprednisolone, a potent therapeutic agent for proteinuria, did not affect the development of nephrosis. An angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonist, losartan, but not a Ca2+ channel blocker, verapamil, inhibited the development of nephrosis while both agents decreased blood pressure to a similar extent as imidapril. In mature Dahl/S rats, imidapril suppressed not only the development of proteinuria but also the glomerular lesions. It is concluded that the development of spontaneous nephrosis in Dahl/S rats is mediated by angiotensin II.",

CcpLEamide was absorbed from the rat small intestine in vitro, whereas LEamide was not. CcpLEamide on the mucosal side was more stable than aminopeptidase-resistant cellobiose-coupled leucine enkephalin (CcpLE) in the presence of inhibitors of enkephalinase and angiotensin converting enzyme, and much more stable than LEamide. The absorption rate (clearance) of CcpLEamide was comparable with that of CcpLE in the presence of these peptidase inhibitors. Analgesic activities of these enkephalins were tested by the acetic acid writhing assay and hot-plate assay after subcutaneous administration to mice. Both assays indicated CcpLEamide-induced analgesia. On the other hand, the analgesic activity of LEamide was not observed, but pretreatment with amastatin (a peptidase inhibitor) produced LEamide-induced analgesia. These results indicate that CcpLEamide is stable in the body and has analgesic effects without pretreatment with peptidase inhibitors, and was stable enough to be absorbed from the small intestine. We propose CcpLEamide as an orally active analgesic peptide candidate.",

Angiotensin increased the intraocular pressure (IOP) in animals. Even, the topical instillation of ACE inhibitors have been reported to reduce the IOP in rabbits. We, therefore performed this randomized, double masked, parallel groups-design and placebo controlled study, to investigate the acute effect of captopril (6.25 mg, 12.50 mg, and 25.00 mg) and placebo on IOP, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate in healthy human volunteers. These parameters were monitored for 4.0 h after the administration of drugs. Captopril 12.50 mg and 25.00 mg significantly reduced the IOP and SBP (P < 0.05). Captopril 6.25 mg also had a tendency to lower the IOP and significantly decreased the SBP (P < 0.05). The mechanism involved in the decrease of IOP and blood pressure with captopril could be due to inhibition in the formation of angiotensin-II and sparing of bradykinin.", 
    "686": "Recent studies in diabetic humans have shown that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may provide additional renal benefit above and beyond conventional antihypertensive agents. We investigated the effect of enalapril on urinary glycosaminoglycans (GAG), heparan sulphate (HS) and microalbuminuria (MAU) in diabetic patients. Urinary GAG and HS levels were determined in controls (n=16, 41.3 +/- 12.9 years old) and in type II diabetics (n=18, 53 +/- 9.6 years old) who were not using ACE inhibitors. Four of these patients had also hypertension. The duration of diabetes was 5.5 +/- 3 years (mean +/- SD). Microalbuminuria was detected in seven patients. The subjects were treated with enalapril (5-10 mg day-1) for 6 weeks. The median values of GAG (n=18, 2.8 mg uronic acid g-1 crea. day-1) and HS (n=18, 1.36 mg glycosamine g-1 crea. day-1) in the pre-treatment group were significantly (p &lt; 0.01) higher than the control group (n=16, 1.98 mg uronic acid g-1crea. day-1 and 0.87 mg glycosamine g-1crea. day-1, respectively. Before treatment, GAG and HS levels seemed to be not different between microalbuminuric and normoalbuminuric as well as hypertensive and normotensive patients. Following enalapril treatment, the median values of GAG (n=18, 1.35 mg uronic acid g-1 crea. day-1) and HS (n= 18, 0.99 mg glycosamine g-1 crea. day-1) tended to decrease to the levels which were not significantly different from the control group. Following treatment, significant reduction in urinary albumin excretion (from 15.45 to 11.1 mg day-1) (p &lt; 0.0005) was also observed. When considering the pre- and post-treatment concentrations, there were positive correlations between urinary GAG and HS values (p &lt; 0.05, r=0.6541 and p &lt; 0.01, r=0.5984). These results suggest that measurement of urinary heparan sulphate may be another useful predictor of clinical diabetic nephropathy; and enalapril causes marked reduction in HS and GAG values in all patients independently by the presence of hypertension.", 
    "687": "A number of animal models are available to investigators wishing to study the use of gene transfer to prevent neointimal formation after vascular injury. The majority are models of primary vascular injury rather than the human situation, where recurrence of a stenosis occurs in an abnormal blood vessel treated by angioplasty. The main animal models used to study vascular balloon injury or angioplasty are the rat carotid, the rabbit iliac, the pig coronary and carotid models, and, less frequently, the dog coronary and primate saphenous or iliac models. A healthy level of skepticism exists about many of these animal models following the success of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in preventing neointima formation in the rat model but their failure to prevent human restenosis (1,2). Each model, however, has a particular suitability to investigate different aspects of the balloon injury process and all are suitable for gene transfer studies.", 
    "688": "Congestive cardiac failure is an increasingly prevalent syndrome associated with a high morbidity and mortality. The role of calcium channel blockers in the treatment of heart failure is unclear. The potential benefits of these agents derive not only from their vasodilator properties, but also from anti-ischemic effects, beneficial effects on endothelial function and the development of atherosclerosis, and favorable effects on calcium cycling at a molecular level. Pitted against this array of potential benefits are direct negative inotropic effects and the potential for neuroendocrine activation. Treatment with short-acting dihydropyridine agents has not resulted in long-term clinical benefits in patients with cardiac failure. Diltiazem may be beneficial in patients with nonischemic heart failure, and verapamil has a neutral effect in cardiac failure, although it may have a role in combination with ace inhibition. To date, amlodipine has been associated with the most promising results, with evidence of a mortality benefit in nonischemic heart failure. Mibefradil is of no benefit in the management of heart failure, although the trend toward increased mortality in the treatment arm of the Mortality Assessment in Congestive Heart Failure (MACH)-1 trial may have been due to drug interactions. The potential role of calcium blockers in diastolic dysfunction and in combination with ace-inhibition requires further study.",

When the patients had originally been referred to the renal clinic, median clinic BP had been 160 mmHg systolic (104-260) and 95 mmHg diastolic (65-160). Under nephrological care, achieved clinic systolic (140; 90-190) and diastolic BP values (85; 45-130) were significantly (P<0.0001) lower. Achieved BP was slightly (r=0.23, P<0.05) correlated with age, was not significantly different between genders, and was not correlated to proteinuria, serum creatinine, renal disease or BMI. Average self measured BP values were not different from systolic and diastolic clinic BP values. Ambulatory BP values, however, were significantly (P<0.0001) lower, e.g. daytime systolic BP 133 mmHg (107-171), diastolic 82 mmHg (65-97). A night-time decrease of BP > or = 15% was seen in 18/25 patients only. The median number of antihypertensive classes required was 3 (range 1-7) in non-diabetic and 3.5 (1-7) in diabetic patients, respectively.

Changes in RIHP correlated positively to changes in renal PP, independent of treatment and age (slope averaged 0.11+/-0.03). Ongoing ACE inhibition until 6 weeks of age neither affected baseline RIHP nor altered the reactivity to changes in perfusion pressure. Mild renal histopathological abnormalities were present already 3 weeks after cessation of treatment and were aggravated significantly in the 13-week-old rats, showing a complete loss of the papillary parenchyma.",

    "701": "One hundred and nine unselected patients with Acute Renal Failure (ARF) of medical aetiology were hospitalized at the Nephrological Unit of Policlinico University Hospital (Modena) during a 30-month period. ARF was considered as a rapid increase of serum creatinine > 2mg/dl over the baseline level or the doubling of pre-existing value in chronic renal failure. Mean age of patients was 67+/-17 years and median age was 72; 64.2% needing dialytic treatment. Four main causes of ARF were identified: 33 patients had reduced renal perfusion by dehydration, hypotension etc.; 20 multifactorial aetiology; 14 biopsy-investigated renal parenchymal diseases and 39 had drug-related acute renal failure (D-ARF). The clinical outcome was significantly worse in elderly patients as regard mortality (P < 0.02), chronic dialytic treatment (P < 0.04) and complete recovery (P < 0.004). The mean age of D-ARF patients was significantly greater than remaining ARF patients (72.6+/-12.8 vs 63.2+/-18.5: P < 0.004. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and ACE-inhibitors (Ace-i) caused ARF in 24 and 8 patients respectively. Elderly age, vascular disease and monoclonal gammopathy represented the main risk factors and were significantly more frequent in D-ARF patients (P<001, <0.01, <0.04 respectively). Our data confirm the high susceptibility of ageing kidneys to nephrotoxic damage caused by drugs affecting glomerular autoregulation by microvascular mechanisms. Greater attention to renal changes in ageing and an increased dissemination of preventative measures among nephrologists, could reduce the incidence of these serious and potentially lethal diseases.", 
    "702": "The mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of microangiopathy and macroangiopathy in diabetes mellitus is hypothesized to be chronic hyperglycaemia. However, the values of blood glucose at which chronic diabetic complications develop at the renal and cardiac level are quite different. It is not clear whether this is due to different responses of kidney and heart tissues to the metabolic challenge of diabetes, or to the simultaneous role of other mechanisms contributing differently to the pathogenesis of chronic diabetic complications in renal and cardiac tissues. One of these mechanisms could be the simultaneous occurrence of arterial hypertension along with hyperglycaemia in diabetic patients. We reviewed the available evidence in the recent medical literature and provide information on the relationships between hyperglycaemia and cardiovascular and renal complications in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). The majority of reports indicate that the values of blood glucose appearing to be at threshold level for the development of cardiovascular complications are significantly lower than those determining renal complications (5.4 vs 10.0 mmol/l blood glucose concentrations 2 h after an oral glucose tolerance test). This was the case both in cross-sectional and prospective studies and also in intervention studies aimed at decreasing blood glucose concentrations by using strict metabolic control methods (The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial Research Group), which succeeded in delaying the rate of occurrence of microangiopathic complications at the kidney and retinal level but not so effectively at the cardiac level. Therefore, alternative therapeutic or supplementary strategies to blood glucose control should be adopted in diabetes to prevent diabetic complications. To date, the most effective approach, from our point of view, is antihypertensive therapy in order to prevent end-stage renal disease. We extensively reviewed the available literature which reported comparisons between angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) in the treatment of arterial hypertension in diabetes. Intensified antihypertensive therapy achieving a blood pressure level below 130/85 mmHg has been shown to be useful in decreasing the rate of occurrence of chronic diabetic complications in diabetes mellitus. Both ACE inhibitors and CCBs have been shown to significantly improve the course of renal function in diabetic patients with incipient and overt nephropathy.", 
    "703": "This brief review will focus on the major factors leading to incipient diabetic nephropathy (i.e. microalbuminuria) progressing to overt nephropathy (i.e. macroalbuminuria) and particularly on the role of glycaemic control and hypertension. Both experimental and cohort studies support the role of hyperglycaemia in the development of diabetic nephropathy. Some recent long-term interventional studies in microalbuminuric patients show conflicting results regarding the role played by good metabolic control in reducing the incidence of overt nephropathy. However, strict metabolic control, which is fundamental in normoalbuminuric patients, is of little use even in microalbuminuric patients. In general, levels of glycosylated haemoglobin less than two standard deviations above the upper normal range, commonly <7.5-8%, seem to protect patients from developing nephropathy. The results of many cross-sectional studies have shown that the progression of renal damage regularly is accompanied by arterial hypertension both in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Many long-term interventional studies have been performed in order to understand the effect of antihypertensive treatment on the incidence of proteinuria in both normotensive and hypertensive patients with IDDM or NIDDM. These data show a marked effect of antihypertensive therapy in preventing the onset of overt nephropathy, and suggest the superiority of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. We believe that optimal blood pressure values are approximately 120/70-75 mmHg in younger patients and 125-130/80-85 mmHg in older patients. In conclusion, antihypertensive treatment, ACE inhibitors per se and possibly strict metabolic control reduce the development of nephropathy, thus playing a striking role in the secondary prevention of renal failure.",

Although newer nonivasive stress imaging modalities provide greater diagnostic accuracy than traditional exercise stress testing, the tests are still less accurate for women.

Digoxin does not reduce mortality but does reduce morbidity.

In controls, the CRA had a peak systolic flow velocity (PSFV) of 34 cm/sec and an end diastolic flow velocity (EDFV) of 14 cm/sec; the PCA had a PSFV of 38 cm/sec and an EDFV of 16 cm/sec. In the hypertensive patients off medication, the CRA had a PSFV of 16 cm/sec and an EDFV of 6 cm/sec; the PCA had a PSFV of 17 cm/sec and an EDFV of 5 cm/sec.

    "716": "We investigated the relation between atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) gene expression and the status of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in aortic tissue in rats made hypertensive by either aortic banding or by deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt administration. These experimental models of hypertension are known to have differences in terms of the status of RAS. ANF messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were measured in aortic tissue by using a newly developed quantitative competitive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (QC-RT-PCR) technique. Changes in the proportions of alpha1 and alpha2 isoforms of Na+K+-adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) mRNA levels were used as indicators of aortic hypertrophy. Treatment with DOCA alone, salt alone, or DOCA-salt for 5 weeks increased aortic-weight/body-weight ratio and aortic angiotensinogen mRNA levels, but did not change alpha1 or alpha2 Na+K+-ATPase mRNA levels. Aortic ANF mRNA levels had a tendency to increase after treatment with DOCA, salt, or DOCA-salt, but this change did not reach statistical significance. Suprarenal aortic banding for 6 weeks or 12 weeks increased aortic-weight/body-weight ratio (12 weeks), decreased alpha2 Na+K+-ATPase and angiotensinogen mRNA levels, but did not affect alpha1 Na+K+-ATPase mRNA levels or ANF mRNA levels. Treatment with ramipril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor was carried out for 6 weeks just after aortic banding (prevention experiment) or after 6 weeks in rats that were banded for the previous 6 weeks (regression experiment). High-dose ramipril (1 mg/kg)--a treatment known to inhibit both tissue and circulating RAS--normalized aortic-weight/body-weight ratio, and also normalized alpha2 Na+K+-ATPase mRNA levels. Aortic angiotensinogen mRNA levels of banded rats treated with high-dose ramipril was higher than those of the normal control, sham operated, and banded rats. Treatment with high-dose ramipril did not affect alpha1 Na+K+-ATPase mRNA levels or ANF mRNA levels. Low-dose ramipril (10 microg/kg)--a treatment that selectively inhibits tissue RAS--normalized aortic-weight/body-weight ratio but did not normalize alpha2 Na+K+-ATPase mRNA levels (regression experiment) or angiotensinogen mRNA levels (prevention experiment) and did not change either alpha1 Na+K+-ATPase mRNA levels or ANF mRNA levels. The results suggest that, in contrast to previous findings in heart and kidney, the regulation of ANF mRNA levels in aortic tissue is largely independent of pressure load, volume load, and plasma or tissue RAS. It is suggested that any antihypertrophic actions of ANF may be mediated by the increased circulating ANF levels and its interaction with its receptor or through CNP.", 
    "717": "There is marked interindividual variation in serum and tissue angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) levels for which the insertion (I)/deletion (D) polymorphism in intron 16 of the ACE gene is a marker. ACE inhibitors have important effects on morbidity and mortality in heart failure. The influence of this polymorphism on the response to ACE inhibitors in patients with heart failure is not known. We studied response by ACE genotype of 34 subjects in a randomised, double-blind, crossover study comparing 6 weeks of lisinopril (10 mg, o.d.) or captopril (25 mg, t.d.s.) on 24-h blood pressure (BP) profile and on renal function in patients with symptomatic heart failure [mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), 24%]. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), 99mTc diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA), and ambulatory 24-h mean arterial pressure (MAP; Spacelabs 90207) were assessed at the beginning and end of treatment periods. There was a significant relation between ACE genotype and change in MAP with captopril (mm Hg; DD group, -0.5; ID, -4.7; II, -7.4; p = 0.02) but not to lisinopril (mm Hg DD, -6.0; ID, -6.6; II, -7.4; p = 0.89) in these patients. There was no significant relation between genotype and change in GFR with captopril (percentage change from baseline: DD, +7.9; ID, +13.1; II, -0.6; p = 0.45) or lisinopril (percentage change from baseline: DD, -0.1; ID, -3.0; II, -13.3; p = 0.39), but the decline in renal function tended to be greatest in II subjects. Whereas the results are not conclusive, there may be a significant interaction between ACE genotype and response to ACE inhibitors in patients with heart failure.", 
    "718": "The effects of N-type calcium channel inhibition with omega-conotoxin GVIA (omega-CTX) on cardiovascular parameters and vagally mediated autonomic reflexes and the role of the renin-angiotensin system were assessed in conscious rabbits. Omega-CTX (10 microg/kg, i.v.) resulted in hypotension, tachycardia, and attenuation of the sympathetic and vagal components of the baroreceptor-heart rate reflex (baroreflex). In the control group (no pretreatment), the peak decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 13 +/- 3 mm Hg from 72 +/- 2 mm Hg occurred after 33 +/- 3 min, with a corresponding tachycardia of 80 +/- 20 beats/min (n = 6). The tachycardia was due to vagal withdrawal, as a similar increase in heart rate (84 +/- 8 beats/min) after omega-CTX was observed after pretreatment with the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol (n = 6). Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition with enalaprilat revealed a larger, more rapid decrease in MAP in response to omega-CTX (-19 +/- 4 mm Hg from 65 +/- 1 mm Hg after 18 +/- 2 min; n = 6) compared with the control group. Similar larger decreases in MAP were also observed in the presence of the AT1-receptor antagonist, losartan, or the bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist, HOE-140 (n = 5-6). Pretreatment with enalaprilat, losartan, or HOE-140 caused a 50% decrease in the reflex tachycardia after omega-CTX compared with that observed in the control group, and omega-CTX caused a greater attenuation of the vagal component of the baroreflex and a decrease in the bradycardia evoked by the Bezold-Jarisch-like reflex. Also, there was a significant decrease in the bradycardia induced by the nasopharyngeal reflex after omega-CTX in the presence of ACE inhibition and HOE-140. Thus in the conscious rabbit, angiotensin II and bradykinin have a role in attenuating and slowing the hypotensive effect of N-type calcium channel inhibition. Vagolytic effects of omega-CTX on the baroreflex are augmented, and on other vagal reflexes are unmasked, via inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. The complexity and mechanism of the interaction between N-type calcium channels and the renin-angiotensin system remain to be elucidated.", 
    "719": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition as well as neutral endopeptidase (NEP) inhibition was demonstrated to influence hemodynamics in various cardiac disease states. However, specific effects of chronic combined ACE and NEP inhibition on left ventricular (LV) and myocyte geometry and function remain unclear. In this study, a dual-acting metalloprotease inhibitor (DMPI), which possesses both ACE and NEP inhibitory activity, was used in a rapid-pacing model of LV dysfunction. LV and myocyte geometry and function were examined in control dogs (n = 6), in dogs with pacing-induced LV dysfunction (216 +/- 2 beats/min, 28 days, n = 7), and in dogs with DMPI treatment during rapid pacing (10 mg/kg p.o., b.i.d., n = 6). With chronic rapid pacing, LV end-diastolic volume increased (84 +/- 4 vs. 49 +/- 3 ml), and LV ejection fraction decreased (38 +/- 3% vs. 68 +/- 3%) compared with control (p < 0.05). DMPI concomitantly administered during long-term rapid pacing did not change LV ejection fraction (35 +/- 3%), but LV end-diastolic volume was reduced (70 +/- 5 vs. 84 +/- 4 ml; p < 0.05) when compared with rapid pacing only. With long-term rapid pacing, myocyte cross-sectional area was decreased (278 +/- 5 vs. 325 +/- 5 microm2), and resting length increased (178 +/- 2 vs. 152 +/- 1 microm) when compared with control (p < 0.05). With DMPI concomitantly administered during rapid pacing, myocyte cross-sectional area (251 +/- 5 microm2) and resting length (159 +/- 4 microm) were reduced when compared with rapid pacing only (p < 0.05). Myocyte velocity of shortening decreased from control values with long-term rapid pacing (39.3 +/- 3.9 vs. 73.2 +/- 5.9 microm/s; p < 0.05) but improved with DMPI treatment during rapid pacing when compared with rapid pacing only (58.9 +/- 6.7 microm/s; p < 0.05). Myocyte velocity of shortening with beta-adrenergic-receptor stimulation (25 nM isoproterenol) was reduced from controls with rapid pacing (125 +/- 12 vs. 214 +/- 30 microm/s; p < 0.05) but was improved with DMPI treatment during rapid pacing when compared with rapid pacing only (178 +/- 12 microm/s; p < 0.05). In a model of rapid pacing-induced LV failure, concomitant DMPI treatment significantly reduced the degree of LV dilation with no apparent effect on LV pump function. At the level of the LV myocyte, long-term DMPI treatment with rapid pacing improved myocyte performance and beta-adrenergic response. Thus the improvement in isolated myocyte contractile function was not translated into improved global LV-pump performance. The mechanisms by which improved myocyte contractility was not translated into a beneficial effect on LV-pump function with DMPI treatment during rapid pacing remain speculative, but likely include significant changes in LV remodeling and loading conditions.", 
    "720": "Hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) are known to increase susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias during and before myocardial ischemia and to increase the risk of periinfarction mortality. Although regression of LVH has been advocated as a therapeutic goal, little evidence exists to suggest that it can reduce periinfarction mortality, and if it does, by which mechanisms it may do this. In this study, we evaluated the effects of control of systemic arterial blood pressure, of regression of myocardial hypertrophy, and of cardiac fibrosis on the susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias and periinfarction mortality in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) model of hypertension and LVH. After 12 weeks of treatment, captopril and hydralazine reduced systolic blood pressure to 93 +/- 14 and 126 +/- 13 mm Hg, respectively, as compared with 193 +/- 12 mm Hg, p < 0.05, in the untreated control SHR group. The decrease with propranolol (to 185 +/- 12 mm Hg) was of borderline significance. There was a significant decrease in inducibility of ventricular arrhythmias by programmed electrical stimulation with captopril (5%; p < 0.05). One hour after infarction, there was a trend toward reduced mortality in the rats treated with hydralazine, 9.5% (p = 0.20 vs. control; p = 0.10 vs. propranolol), and captopril, 5% (p = 0.08 vs. control; p = 0.010 vs. propranolol). However, only captopril reduced 3-h postinfarction mortality (40%; p = 0.022) compared with 72% in the control group. The results showed a significant decrease of the left ventricular weight/body weight ratio in the rats treated with hydralazine (2.6 +/- 0.2 mg/g; p < 0.05) and captopril (2.2 +/- 0.2 mg/g; p < 0.05) compared with the control group (2.8 +/- 0.2 mg/g). An assessment of cardiac fibrosis indicated that captopril decreased the volume percentage of collagen the most (2.01 +/- 0.53; p < 0.05), followed by propranolol (2.29 +/- 0.64; p < 0.05) and hydralazine (2.92 +/- 0.58; p < 0.05) versus controls (3.23 +/- 0.61). This study suggests that regression of myocardial hypertrophy or long-term normalization of arterial systolic blood pressure or both are the major determinants of very early mortality (within 1 h after infarction) and that later mortality (3 h after infarction) may be the result of a more complex interplay of regression of myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis and of control of blood pressure.",

In this case-control study, we investigated the association of the insertion (I)/deletion (D) angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene polymorphism, Factor V Leiden (R506Q) mutation, and 5,10 methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene polymorphism with post-operative venous thrombosis in 85 patients who underwent elective total hip arthroplasty. The odds of a thrombotic event following hip surgery among subjects with the DD genotype of the ACE gene was increased more than 10-fold compared to subjects with the II genotype (odds ratio 11.7 [95% confidence interval 2.3-84.5]); it was increased 5-fold in subjects with the ID genotype compared to the II genotype (odds ratio 5.0 [95% confidence interval 1.1-34.9]). Mean plasma ACE level in control subjects not on ACE inhibitors at the time of study (n=43) was lowest in persons homozygous for the I allele (18.9+/-7.95 U/l), intermediate in patients with the ID genotype (31.6+/-10.8 U/l) and highest in subjects homozygous for the D allele (44.0+/-7.14 U/l). Mean plasma ACE level among cases was higher (33.0 U/l, n=25) than among controls (29.4 U/l, n=43) but this difference was not statistically significant. Neither the Factor V Leiden mutation nor MTHFR gene polymorphism increased the risk of thrombosis following hip replacement. These results demonstrate that the I/D ACE gene polymorphism is a potent risk factor for thrombosis in subjects undergoing total hip arthroplasty.",

    "729": "Lisinopril induced a marked increase in plasma renin activity (from 1.1+/-0.2 to 6.4+/-1.3 ng/ml per h, P< 0.01) and a reduction in mean arterial pressure (from 109.6+/-3.1 to 98.7+/-2.9 mmHg, P < 0.01) without affecting the heart rate. Plasma norepinephrine and muscle sympathetic nerve activity values were not significantly different before and after lisinopril treatment (plasma norepinephrine values changed from 290.4+/-39.2 to 308.1+/-67.1 pg/ml; muscle sympathetic nerve activity changed from 56.4+/-5.3 to 50.6+/-6.6 bursts/100 heart beats). Neither the sympathoinhibitory nor the sympathoexcitatory responses to phenylephrine and nitroprusside were affected by lisinopril, nor the concomitant bradycardia and tachycardia. The curves relating mean arterial pressure to heart rate and muscle sympathetic nerve activity values during baroreceptor manipulation were shifted to the left, indicating a resetting of the baroreflex to the lower blood pressure values achieved during treatment. CONCLUSIONS In essential hypertension, sympathetic nerve traffic is not affected by chronic angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor treatment that effectively interferes with the renin-angiotensin system and lowers the elevated blood pressure. The baroreflex ability to modulate heart rate and central sympathetic outflow is also unaffected. These data argue against the existence of a central sympathoexcitatory effect of angiotensin II in this condition. They also indicate that antihypertensive treatment with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor preserves autonomic reflex control, with favorable consequences for cardiovascular homeostasis.",

    "731": "Chronic hyperinsulinemia was achieved by infusing insulin (3 mU/kg per min) subcutaneously by an osmotic minipump for 6 weeks. An angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (fosinopril, 10 mg/kg per day) was added in drinking water and the angiotensin II subtype 1 receptor antagonist losartan (3.5 microg/kg per min) was co-infused via the minipump. Control rats were administered the vehicle only. The rats were housed in individual metabolic cages and fed a sodium-controlled diet. Food and water intake and urine output were measured daily. Systolic blood pressure and heart rate were measured by the tail-cuff method twice a week.", 
    "732": "By the end of weeks 4 and 6 of the sustained insulin infusion, systolic blood pressure had increased significantly (P < 0.05), from 134+/-1 to 157+/-2 and 158+/-2 mmHg, respectively, and the heart rate had increased significantly (P< 0.05), from 380+/-9 to 423+/-7 and 426+/-6 beats/min, respectively. The plasma insulin concentration increased by 2-2.5 times but no significant changes in plasma glucose and triglyceride levels were noted. Concomitant treatment with fosinopril prevented the rises in systolic blood pressure and heart rate in the insulin-infused rats. When the insulin-induced hypertension had become established (systolic blood pressure increased from 132+/-3 to 155+/-2 mmHg 4 weeks after the infusion, P< 0.05 ), subsequent fosinopril or losartan treatment for 2 weeks reversed the elevated systolic blood pressure and heart rate to the control levels. There were no significant differences in water intake, urine flow, sodium gain and body weight gain between the control and the insulin-infused rats.", 
    "733": "Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition or angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonism can prevent and reverse insulin-induced hypertension in rats, suggesting that angiotensin II itself or an angiotensin II-dependent mechanism has an etiological influence in the pathogenesis of this hypertension model.", 
    "734": "Since the biochemical disturbance underlying hypertension may be an important determinant of patient outcome, we compared the effects of early treatment with different antihypertensive drugs on end-organ damage in the TGR(mREN2)27 transgenic rat (REN-2). In these REN-2 rats, hypertension is primarily caused by increased activity of the tissue renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "735": "Seven-week-old REN-2 rats were either untreated or treated orally with an optimal daily dose of carvedilol (30 mg/kg), hydralazine (30 mg/kg), losartan (10 mg/kg) or quinapril (15 mg/kg). Nontransgenic littermates served as normotensive controls. After 11 weeks of treatment, we determined plasma norepinephrine concentrations, left ventricular atrial natriuretic factor messenger RNA and cardiac and vascular function and hypertrophy.", 
    "736": "Chronic treatment with carvedilol and hydralazine significantly decreased blood pressure to a similar level but failed to normalize it, whereas both losartan and quinapril completely normalized blood pressure. Despite a blood pressure reduction in all treatment groups, only losartan, quinapril and hydralazine preserved endothelial function, while carvedilol did not. Furthermore, losartan and quinapril prevented cardiac and medial hypertrophy. The expression of atrial natriuretic factor messenger RNA paralleled the hemodynamic changes. Plasma norepinephrine levels were normalized by losartan or quinapril but remained increased after carvedilol and hydralazine treatment.", 
    "737": "In REN-2 hypertensive rats, end-organ damage can be prevented by both inhibition of the angiotensin converting enzyme and blockade of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor, but not by merely lowering blood pressure. When blood pressure is not fully normalized, the effects on end-organs are clearly dissociated from the antihypertensive effects.", 
    "738": "Plasma renin is not elevated in recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO)-induced hypertension but angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors reduce blood pressure in both human and animal studies. Since rhEPO elevates renin and angiotensinogen messenger RNAs in angiotensin II target tissues such as the aorta, we explored the actions of rhEPO on renin-angiotensin system-related gene transcription of cultured rat vascular smooth muscle cells.", 
    "739": "To separate direct actions of rhEPO from those mediated secondarily by potential activation of the renin-angiotensin system, vascular smooth muscle cells were cultured with rhEPO and enalapril to inhibit the angiotensin converting enzyme and losartan to inhibit angiotensin II type 1 receptors.", 
    "740": "Vascular smooth muscle cells cultured with rhEPO (6-8 units/ml) demonstrated elevations (40-120%) in messenger RNAs of the renin-angiotensin system (renin, angiotensinogen, angiotensin receptor types 1 and 2) and increased levels of several messenger RNAs known to respond to angiotensin II (transforming growth factor-beta, insulin-like growth factor-II, epidermal growth factor, c-fos and platelet-derived growth factor). In contrast, cells cultured in the presence of rhEPO and enalapril or losartan showed elevations of messenger RNA for only the two types of angiotensin II receptor. This increase was higher than that obtained when cells were cultured with rhEPO or either antagonist alone. The increase in specific binding of angiotensin II to cells cultured in the presence of rhEPO and enalapril or rhEPO and losartan paralleled the changes in receptor messenger RNA.", 
    "741": "rhEPO exerts its primary action on vascular smooth muscle cells via an increase in angiotensin receptor messenger RNA, resulting in a parallel increase in angiotensin II receptor expression. We suggest that increased receptor expression secondarily mediates the expression of other renin-angiotensin system messenger RNAs, which leads to angiotensin II-responsive gene transcription. The elevation in angiotensin II receptors, as observed in response to rhEPO, may provide a mechanism by which other forms of renin-dependent hypertension are initiated.", 
    "742": "ROLE OF CALCIUM: Alterations in the structure and function of small arteries may contribute to elevated blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension and the cardiovascular complications of this disease. Angiotensin II, endothelin 1, and other peptides, as well as catecholamines, may contribute to the altered structure and function of small arteries, in part through their effects on intracellular calcium. Intracellular calcium is implicated in signal transduction pathways that result in smooth muscle cell growth and contraction and in the release of endothelium-dependent agents involved in the regulation of vascular function.", 
    "743": "The newer antihypertensive agents that affect intracellular calcium pathways either directly or indirectly, such as calcium antagonists or angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, may exert vascular protective effects, partly by regressing vascular remodeling and by correcting endothelial dysfunction. A double-blind trial comparing the effects of the ACE inhibitor cilazapril and the beta-blocker atenolol on media: lumen ratio of small gluteal subcutaneous arteries, which was significantly higher in hypertensive patients before treatment than in normotensive subjects, was corrected after treatment with cilazapril. In contrast, no improvement was seen in the media: lumen ratio of small arteries in the patients receiving atenolol, even after 2 years of treatment. In another study, treatment with the intrinsically long-acting calcium antagonist amlodipine resulted in a reduction in forearm minimal vascular resistance. Patients treated with amlodipine also showed normalized responses of forearm blood flow to nitric oxide synthase inhibition. Furthermore, patients treated with a slow-release formulation of nifedipine exhibited normal media: lumen ratio of small arteries and normal endothelium-dependent relaxation.", 
    "744": "These findings appear very promising; however, it remains to be demonstrated whether the apparently beneficial effects of treatment with long-acting calcium antagonists and ACE inhibitors will lead to reductions in the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality associated with hypertension.", 
    "745": "In animal models of hypertension, the resistance state of the preglomerular (afferent) and postglomerular (efferent) capillary arterioles may determine whether a particular form of antihypertensive therapy will spare the kidney from hemodynamic-mediated glomerular injury. In experimental models of renal disease with impaired autoregulation, control of systemic blood pressure is a prerequisite for normalizing glomerular capillary hydraulic pressure.", 
    "746": "In humans, effective blood pressure control reverses renal hemodynamic abnormalities in hypertensive patients, reduces microalbuminuria in essential hypertensive, nondiabetic, and diabetic renal diseases, and attenuates but does not prevent the progression of nondiabetic and diabetic renal disease. Although some researchers have concluded that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are the renal protective drugs of choice, these pronouncements are not based on clinical trials correlating specific drug-mediated changes in albumin or protein excretion with the longitudinal assessment of glomerular filtration rate (GFR), permitting derivation of a slope-defining change in GFR, and/or the longitudinal assessment of renal structure (i.e. renal biopsy). Definitive clinical trials have not been reported. It is important to recognize that an elevated serum creatinine is a powerful predictor of mortality and that, in most patients, death is caused by a cardiovascular or cerebrovascular event, rather than by renal failure.", 
    "747": "Because morbidity and mortality of essential hypertension and nondiabetic or diabetic renal disease is related primarily to cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events, the antihypertensive 'drugs of choice' should be those that reduce these risks, prevent or regress target-organ damage, and optimize treatment of concomitant diseases.", 
    "748": "Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) represents an important intermediate end-point for, for example, the progression to heart failure. The persistence or progression of LVH despite antihypertensive therapy probably reflects the persistence or activation of mechanisms that negatively affect the cardiovascular system and, consequently, long-term outcome.", 
    "749": "Long-term treatment with rapid-onset (and usually short-acting) dihydropyridine calcium antagonists is significantly less effective than angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition in reducing left ventricular mass (LVM) in hypertensive patients. Both intermittent, and probably only partial, blood pressure control and an increase in sympathetic activity resulting from rapid decreases in blood pressure following dosing with such calcium antagonists may contribute to this relative ineffectiveness. In contrast, more recent studies have demonstrated that the longer acting dihydropyridines can reduce LVM as effectively as ACE inhibitors.", 
    "750": "Among the 1,4-dihydropyridines, drugs such as amlodipine and nifedipine in the gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) maintain good blood pressure control over the full 24-h dosing period and do not cause dose-related increases in sympathetic activity. In contrast, extended-release felodipine has been shown to provide only intermittent blood pressure control, still leading to sympathetic activation. Notably, during short periods of noncompliance, blood pressure control is maintained with intrinsically long-acting agents such as amlodipine but not with slow-release formulations of short-acting agents such as nifedipine GITS.", 
    "751": "It is possible that the rate of onset and duration of action of various dihydropyridines may be pivotal factors in determining their effects on cardiovascular outcomes. Thus, the least beneficial dihydropyridines may be rapid-onset, short-acting agents, such as nifedipine capsules, and the most beneficial may be the slow-onset, long-acting agents such as amlodipine.", 
    "752": "Type 2 diabetes is an important, independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. As a result of the pandemic explosion of Type 2 diabetes, reducing the human and financial consequences of the disease is a major healthcare concern. In primary prevention, antihypertensive treatment, aspirin and lipid-lowering intervention are effective at reducing the incidence of coronary heart disease although the beneficial effect of optimal glycaemic control remains to be conclusively proven. Type 2 diabetic patients with acute myocardial infarction should receive a specific programme of intensive treatment, which includes optimal glycaemic control using intensive insulin treatment, thrombolysis, and early use of beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Secondary prevention is also essential because beta-blockers and lipid interventions are more effective in Type 2 diabetic patients than in non-diabetic patients with coronary artery disease. Unfortunately, too many Type 2 diabetic patients do not receive adequate treatment or do not comply with their long-term medical recommendations.", 
    "753": "Interest in evidence-based medicine is increasing greatly, with the focus on treatment that prevents organ failure and that may prolong life. Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes are conditions associated with increased mortality, mainly as a result of renal and cardiovascular diseases, and blindness. All three complications usually occur together. In recent years, more focus has been placed on treating patients early to prevent future organ damage. Microalbuminuria is an important intermediary end-point that correlates strongly with future advanced renal disease, retinopathy and mortality. Several trials have studied patients with microalbuminuria and also patients in more advanced stages of the disease who have proteinuria (termed overt nephropathy). Recent evidence indicates that achieving optimal glycaemic control reduces the risk of an increase in urinary albumin excretion before the development of microalbuminuria. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are effective in reducing microalbuminuria, partly independent of their blood pressure reducing effects. In Type 1 and Type 2 diabetic patients with microalbuminuria, long-term treatment with ACE inhibitors (7-8 years) prevents the predicted decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR); optimal glycaemic control is also important in preventing the decline in GFR. This is important because GFR is usually well preserved in Type 1 and Type 2 diabetic patients with microalbuminuria and a predicted decline in GFR can therefore be prevented. In overt renal disease, studies that focused mostly on Type 1 diabetic patients have shown that the rate of decline in GFR can be reduced. Long-term studies in Type 1 diabetic patients have also demonstrated that mortality caused by end-stage renal disease can be postponed. Mortality associated with cardiovascular diseases, e.g. myocardial infarction, is reduced more effectively in diabetic patients treated with ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers than in non-diabetic patients treated with the same drugs. Screening for microalbuminuria, the attainment of optimal glycaemic control, and early treatment with ACE inhibitors and other antihypertensive drugs are necessary to prevent progression of diabetic complications, especially diabetic nephropathy. However, there is some controversy about the initial use of calcium channel blockers. In conclusion, early achievement of improved glycaemic control is the most important factor in the prevention of diabetic complications. Antihypertensive treatment is clearly also important.",

    "756": "A total of 622 prescriptions containing 1903 items were collected. Antihypertensive and antidiabetic drugs accounted for 25.9 and 9.1% usage, respectively. Calcium channel blocking agents, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blocking agents were the most popular antihypertensive drugs used. Sulphonylureas were the most frequently prescribed antidiabetic agents. Amlodipine, doxazosin and sotalol accounted for 4.5% of all prescription items but 27.8% of the total drug expenditure.", 
    "757": "The use of antihypertensive and antidiabetic drugs accounted for most of the drug usage in this study. Use of newer and more expensive agents has further increased drug expenditure. Monitoring drug usage and their correlations with clinical outcomes are warranted.", 
    "758": "The effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on the diabetic retinal circulation has not been studied previously. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of ACE inhibition and beta-blockade on retinal blood flow (RBF) in a group of 45 hypertensive diabetic subjects using a randomized double-blind trial over a period of 12 months. Laser Doppler velocimetry and computed image analysis were used to measure RBF. The changes in blood pressure over 12 months were comparable (perindopril [PE]: systolic [SBP] 152.1 +/- 3.3 and diastolic [DBP] 97.2 +/- 1.7 mm Hg to SBP 136.8 +/- 3.4 and DBP 85.8 +/- 2.1; atenolol: SBP 158.9 +/- 5.1 and DBP 97.5 +/- 1.6 mm Hg to SBP 137.9 +/- 3.4 and DBP 85.1 +/- 1.6; P = .607, mean +/- SEM). RBF decreased from 17.19 +/- 2.21 microL x min(-1) to 14.18 +/- 1.50 microL x min(-1) in the PE group (n = 15, P = .208) while it increased with atenolol from 15.80 +/- 1.24 microL x min(-1) to 16.99 +/- 1.18 microL x min(-1) (n = 17, P = .399). The comparison of percentage changes in RBF (PE -7.16% +/- 11.49%; atenolol, +15.31% +/- 9.51%) reached statistical significance (P < .05). There was an increase in RBF in 33.3% of subjects receiving PE and in 70.6% of those receiving atenolol. Similar trends were found for retinal conductance. There were no significant changes in the parameters of retinal vascular permeability. Albuminuria decreased to a greater degree with PE, but did not reach significance (PE, 112.1 +/- 39.5 mg/24 h to 88.6 +/- 30.5 mg/24 h; atenolol, 87.3 +/- 51.7 mg/24 h to 82.1 +/- 47.7 mg/24 h). This suggests that ACE inhibition therapy may promote a hemodynamic milieu in the hypertensive diabetic retinal circulation that serves to protect against the progression of diabetic retinopathy, whereas beta-blockade has the opposite effect.", 
    "759": "Vascular disease is now the major cause of morbidity and mortality in the diabetic population. Our group explored the vascular changes associated with experimental diabetes and examined whether these changes can be ameliorated by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. The ACE inhibitor perindopril (PE) was administered to streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats for 24 weeks. At death, mesenteric vessels were perfused in vivo followed by assessment of the vascular architecture by quantitative histomorphometry. In a subgroup of animals, RNA was extracted from the mesenteric vasculature for assessment of gene expression of the prosclerotic cytokine, transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFbeta1), and the matrix protein, type IV collagen. Diabetes was associated with smooth muscle hypertrophy and extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation. ECM accumulation, particularly collagen deposition, was observed in the medial and adventitial layers. ACE inhibition prevented mesenteric vascular hypertrophy after 24 weeks of diabetes. In addition, overexpression of TGFbeta1 in the vessels of diabetic animals was prevented by PE treatment. Similarly, type IV collagen mRNA levels were increased in diabetic vessels, and this overexpression was also prevented by PE therapy. In summary, ACE inhibition attenuates many of the vascular changes observed in experimental diabetes and may have important clinical implications as a vasoprotective agent in human diabetes.", 
    "760": "Essential hypertension is known to be associated with a decrease in the lumen diameter and an increase in the wall thickness to lumen diameter ratio of the resistance vessels. Recently, it has been clarified that this alteration does not necessarily involve vascular growth, but could be due to a rearrangement of the same amount of material, a phenomenon now termed \"eutrophic remodeling.\" These changes are found both in human essential hypertension and in animal models of genetic hypertension. Antihypertensive treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors causes a dose-dependent regression of the media to lumen ratio in rats. Clinical studies have now confirmed these findings, showing that when previously untreated essential hypertensive patients are treated with the ACE inhibitor perindopril (PE), the abnormal structure of resistance vessels regresses toward normal values; in contrast, treatment with a beta-blocker does not affect the abnormal vascular structure. The available evidence thus indicates that ACE inhibitors are able to normalize the abnormal resistance vessel structure in essential hypertension, and suggest that this effect may not only be dependent on their ability to reduce blood pressure. This review summarizes these findings, and discusses the extent to which this is desirable.", 
    "761": "We conducted a 3-year randomized placebo-controlled double-blind study to determine the effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor perindopril (PE) on the progress of renal function and histology in subjects with diabetes and microalbuminuria. Forty non-insulin-dependent (NIDDM) and insulin-dependent (IDDM) diabetic subjects, either normotensive or hypertensive, were randomly assigned to receive PE (n = 20) or placebo (n = 20). A percutaneous renal biopsy was performed initially in all patients and repeated in 29 patients after 3 years. The mean glomerular volume, glomerular basement membrane (GBM) thickness, interstitial fibrosis, sclerosed glomeruli, and volume fraction of capillary lumina were measured histomorphometrically. Before treatment, both groups had similar clinical characteristics, blood pressure, glycosylated hemoglobin (Hb), albumin excretion rate, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), serum creatinine, and renal structural damage. Blood pressure was well controlled in both groups. After 3 years' therapy, there was no significant change in renal function and albuminuria in the PE or placebo groups. The increase in GBM thickness in nine paired biopsies was significantly less in PE-treated subjects (P = .0275). Interstitial fibrosis tended to increase less in the PE group, although this did not reach statistical significance. This study indicates that long-term therapy with PE may decrease or delay the progression of structural glomerular damage in microalbuminuric diabetic subjects.", 
    "762": "The role of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition in glucose metabolism and renal injury in diabetes has been extensively investigated in diabetic humans, as well as in animal models of diabetes. Accumulated data indicate that ACE inhibitors have either no adverse effect on glucose control or insulin sensitivity or may even improve them. ACE inhibitors also appear to have neutral or positive effects on lipid metabolism. The variability of results between studies may relate to differences in experimental design, the degree of glycemia or insulin resistance, potassium balance, and dose or duration of ACE inhibitor treatment, among others. In contrast, ACE inhibitors have proved effective in limiting proteinuria and retarding renal function loss in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) or non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) patients. In rats with experimental or spontaneous diabetes, ACE inhibitors also reduce proteinuria and limit glomerular as well as tubulointerstitial damage, independent of their effects on systemic arterial pressure. How ACE inhibitors limit renal injury in diabetes is not entirely clear, but hemodynamic and nonhemodynamic mechanisms may be involved. Increasing evidence suggests that the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system (RAS) may be altered or activated in the diabetic kidney. Such activation may be specifically inhibited by ACE inhibitors and may explain the superiority of this class of agents over other antihypertensive agents in reducing proteinuria and slowing the progression of diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "763": "Cytokines regulate the expression of other cytokines in the centrally derived rat C6 glioma cell line. However, the modulation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha, a pivotal proinflammatory cytokine) in C6 cells is unknown. Here we investigated the expression of TNF-alpha mRNA in C6 glioma cells in response to TNF-alpha, interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha). The data show that (1) IL-1beta induced a significant upregulation of TNF-alpha mRNA; (2) the effect of IL-1beta on TNF-alpha mRNA expression was completely blocked by the concomitant application of IL-1Ra, which suggests specificity of IL-1beta action through the IL-1 signaling receptor; (3) no detectable modulation of TNF-alpha mRNA expression was observed with the individual applications of TNF-alpha, IL-6, or IFN-alpha; (4) the concomitant treatments of TNF-alpha + IL-1beta or TNF-alpha + IL-1beta + IL-6 strongly upregulated TNF-alpha mRNA expression, whereas the concomitant application of TNF-alpha + IL-6 or IL-1beta + IL-6 induced a moderate increase; and (5) IFN-alpha significantly attenuated induction of TNF-alpha mRNA by TNF-alpha + IL-1beta + IL-6. Thus, IL-1beta, TNF-alpha and IL-6 interact to upregulate TNF-alpha mRNA expression synergistically, and IFN-alpha acts as an inhibitory cytokine in C6 glioma cells. These findings also suggest that the rat C6 glioma cell line may be used as an in vitro model to characterize cytokine-cytokine interactions.", 
    "764": "The relationship between the myocardial uptake of iodine-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine (123I-MIBG) and heart rate variability parameters has not been determined. This study determined the relationship between the change in myocardial uptake of 123I-MIBG and improvement in left ventricular function after treatment, to determine the usefulness of 123I-MIBG imaging to assess the effect of therapy on heart failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). 123I-MIBG imaging and power spectral analysis of heart rate variability were performed before and after treatment in 17 patients with heart failure due to DCM. The following parameters were compared before and after treatment: New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, radiographic cardiothoracic ratio (CTR), blood pressure, echocardiographic data [left ventricular end-systolic (LVDs) and end-diastolic (LVDd) diameters, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)], plasma concentrations of norepinephrine and epinephrine, heart rate variability power spectral analysis data [mean low frequency (MLF) and high frequency power (MHF)] and the myocardium to mediastinum activity ratio (MYO/M) obtained in early and late images, and washout rate calculated by anterior planar imaging of 123I-MIBG. The NYHA functional class, LVEF, LVDs, CTR, MLF and MHF improved after treatment. Early MYO/M and late MYO/M improved after treatment. The rate of increase in late MYO/M was positively correlated with the rate of improvement of LVEF after treatment. Furthermore, the late MYO/M was negatively correlated with MLF. Washout rate revealed no correlation with hemodynamic parameters. These findings suggest that late MYO/M is more useful than washout rate to assess the effect of treatment on heart failure due to DCM. Furthermore, the 123I-MIBG imaging and heart rate variability parameters are useful to assess the autonomic tone in DCM with heart failure.", 
    "765": "Many therapeutic approaches are under evaluation in patients with cardiac failure. They include angiotensin receptor inhibitors, selective and non-selective endothelin receptor inhibitors, neutral endopeptidase inhibitors or mixed inhibitors of neutral endopeptidase and of the angiotensin converting enzyme and, finally, cytokinin modulators. Some of these drugs have already entered Phase II therapeutic trials and are at relatively advanced developmental stages. Others are at preliminary or experimental stages. If these new drugs prove to be effective and well tolerated, they will represent new tools for physicians to treat cardiac failure and prevent its progression. However, many questions concerning drug associations and poly-therapy will be raised, leading to a revision of the strategy of treatment of cardiac failure.", 
    "766": "The management of cardiac failure due to diastolic dysfunction is not well codified and is often empirical. It has three objectives: improving the physiopathological components of ventricular filling, treating the associated aggravating pathological conditions, and treating the basic cause of the dysfunction. Symptomatic treatment aims to reduce venous congestion (by diuretics or nitrate derivatives), to prolong the diastolic period by slowing the heart rate (by betablockers, bradycardising calcium antagonists or digitalis in cases of irreducible atrial fibrillation), to improve passive ventricular distensibility by an effect on remodelling (by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or anti-aldosterone diuretics). The treatment of associated pathological conditions is particularly important. It is essential to maintain or reestablish an effective atrial systole by cardioversion and anti-arrhythmic drugs in atrial fibrillation, by dual chamber pacing in cases of atrioventricular asynchrony due to atrioventricular block. Treatment of the underlying cause aims to induce regression of ventricular hypertrophy of hypertensive origin by using antihypertensive drugs with this property. In coronary artery disease, the choice is determined by the clinical context because nearly all anti-anginal or interventional treatments may improve ischaemic diastolic dysfunction. The same applies in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy because most types of treatment (betablockers, verapamil, cardiac pacing, surgery) may improve diastolic function. Finally, in valvular aortic stenosis, aortic valve replacement restores normal diastolic function.", 
    "767": "The aim of the treatment of symptomatic cardiac failure on effort (Classes II and III) is to improve symptoms and functional capacity and to decrease mortality. The management of such patients includes the investigation of causal and/or aggravating factors which require specific treatment. Hygenic-dietetic rules are important with a low salt diet and restriction of water intake. The continuation of mild physical exercise should be encouraged. Medical treatment associates diuretics to reduce congestive symptoms and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors to improve survival. This treatment may be completed by the association of digoxin and/or carvedilol depending on the functional outcome. When stabilised, the patient's diuretic should be reduced to the minimal required dose. If patients remain symptomatic on quadruple therapy, they probably require reevaluation in hospital.", 
    "768": "Heart failure is a major problem of public health, associated with poor outcome in the advanced stage, thus justifying its prevention. Primary prevention is based on the prevention and treatment of its principal etiologic factors, hypertension and coronary artery disease. Broad use of echocardiography or dosage of neurohormonal markers improve detection of asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction. In ischemic heart disease, coronary recanalisation prevents or limits left ventricular remodeling and dysfunction, even if the \"open artery\" theory has not been entirely proved. Understanding the deleterous role of neurohormonal stimulation results in a large use of ACE-inhibitors, which beneficial effect has been demonstrated also in case of asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction. Betablockers, already largely used after myocardial infarction, seem to have also a beneficial effect in heart failure: the same is probably also true for angiotensin II-antagonists. Double blocking of both the sympathetic nervous system and the angiotensin-aldosterone system seems to be recommended. More precisely understanding the pathways signaling the processes of ventricular remodeling and dysfunction points to new potential targets for a preventive treatment: endothelin receptors, apoptosis, oxidative stress, cytokines or even angiogenesis.", 
    "769": "The management of a patient in cardiac failure should lead the physician to ask if the patient might benefit from treatment with an angiotensin converting inhibitor. Meta-analyses give a positive reply but often lack detail. Analysis of large scale therapeutic trials is the only way to determine whether the results are applicable in an individual case. This analysis starts with validation of the methodology (correct randomisation, respect of double blind protocol, identity of groups) and synthesis of results expressed, if possible, in absolute values. In a second stage, the criteria of inclusion, exclusion, and the comorbidity of enrolled patients, should be compared with those of the patient under consideration. In addition, the amplitude of the therapeutic benefit and the importance of undesired effects must be taken into account in the therapeutic decision. This approach allows a reasoned prescription based on documented facts.", 
    "770": "Therapeutic advances have changed the mode of presentation of cardiac failure over the last decades: the main cause, nowadays, is myocardial ischaemia. The modern treatment of cardiac failure is based on relatively simple physiopathological mechanisms which take into account the different aspects of cardiac physiology: a pump, a muscle, a coronary circulation supplying oxygen to the myocardium, an automatic contraction. The concept of vasodilatation and the blocking of vasoconstrictive systems introduced during the 70s is the basis of modern treatment of cardiac failure which involves angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and, increasingly, betablockers. In the near future, with earlier treatment of cardiac failure, the stimulation of vasodilator systems could become a new therapeutic strategy. Early detection of ischaemia and its complications with the aim of limiting the loss of cardiac myocytes is a priority for slowing the progression of cardiac failure. The prevention of cardiac failure also depends on educating cardiologists to treat rapidly the factors predisposing to or prolonging episodes of even mild cardiac failure.", 
    "771": "Isolated systolic hypertension is a common disorder in the elderly carrying a high risk of stroke and cardiovascular disease. Isolated systolic hypertension is usually defined as a systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 160 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure less than 95 mmHg. The arterial stiffening is the principal cause of increasing systolic pressure in advanced age. It is due to degeneration of the arterial wall and is associated with progressive arterial dilatation. Hypertension in elderly patients is also characterized by increase of peripheral vascular resistance. Due to the wide variability of blood pressure usually seen in old persons, the isolated systolic hypertension is not easy to recognize and final diagnosis requires a long period of observation. The ambulatory blood pressure monitoring proved to be helpful in distinguishing patients with true isolated systolic hypertension from subjects with exaggerated alarm reaction to the pressure measurement. Although the increased risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular mortality is well established for isolated systolic hypertension, there has been much debate whether available antihypertensive treatment can prevent or delay cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications in this condition. During the last year several large new trials have been published, the so-called STOP-Hypertension, SHEP and MRC trials. All studies have demonstrated that the treatment of isolated systolic hypertension with diuretics or/and beta blockers (frequently used in combination) resulted in a significant reduction in the incidence of stroke and major cardiovascular events. New antihypertensive agents such as calcium channel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have also been shown to effectively lower systolic blood pressure in the elderly but the effects on long-term morbidity and mortality are still unknown.", 
    "772": "Low-molecular-weight proteins (LMWPs) accumulate in the proximal tubular cells of the kidney, which makes these proteins interesting tools for renal drug targeting. We studied this approach using the LMWP lysozyme as a carrier for the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril. Captopril was conjugated to lysozyme via a disulfide bond. The pharmacokinetics of the captopril-lysozyme conjugate was studied in the rat. Only intact conjugate could be detected in the circulation. The total amount of captopril disulfides in the kidney was six times higher after administration of the conjugate than after the administration of an equivalent amount of free captopril. The conjugate was recovered in the urine partially as intact conjugate and partially as low-molecular-weight disulfides. The excretion of conjugate in the urine was not a consequence of the coupling of captopril to lysozyme because an equivalent bolus dose of native lysozyme was similarly excreted into the urine. By determination of the renal angiotensin-converting enzyme activity, we showed that the conjugate was degraded to the pharmacologically active captopril in vivo. We conclude that the coupling of captopril to the LMWP lysozyme results in increased captopril concentrations in the kidney and reduced captopril concentrations in the circulation.", 
    "773": "Understanding the effect of serum lipid levels on risk factors for coronary heart disease and how they are influenced by medical therapy may lead to overall better care of the glaucoma patient. Elevated low-density lipoprotein and total cholesterol levels are major risk factors for heart disease. In contrast, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) is protective for heart disease. beta-adrenergic blockers, a class of medicines used to treat glaucoma, may influence serum lipid levels. Oral nonselective beta-adrenergic blockers reduce HDL cholesterol by 19% and increase triglycerides by 20-40%. Furthermore, topical nonselective beta-adrenergic blockers also decrease serum HDL and worsen the total cholesterol/HDL ratio. However, beta-blockers with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity appear to be lipid neutral. At present, there is no clear clinical evidence to indicate that changes in serum lipids with use of topical beta-adrenergic blockers significantly affect the clinical course of the patient. Little information is available for other classes of medicines used topically to treat glaucoma. However, oral preparations of prostaglandins, alpha-adrenergic agonists, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers do not adversely affect serum lipid levels. Further study is required on newer glaucoma preparations to determine their specific actions on lipid levels. Additionally, further work is required to understand the significance of not only the adverse effect of beta-adrenergic blockers on lipid levels, but their overall effect on long-term cardiac morbidity and mortality.", 
    "774": "We investigated the effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) on postsynaptic adrenoceptor sensitivity and compared the effect of the lipophilic ACEI, quinapril, and that of hydrophilic agent, enalapril in human vessels.", 
    "775": "Alpha-adrenoceptor sensitivity was evaluated using the dorsal hand vein compliance technique. The dose-response curves of vasoconstriction to phenylephrine and prostaglandin F2alpha were obtained in healthy male volunteers.", 
    "776": "The ACEIs shifted the dose-response curve of phenylephrine to the right and raised the median effective dose (ED50; 189.3 (57.6 ng min(-1)) of phenylephrine. Following quinapril administration, ED50 increased to 481.1 (101.8 ngmin(-1) compared with 266.8 (55.8 ngmin(-1) after enalapril (95% CI for differences; 31.1-397.5 ng min(-1)). Quinapril administration had no effect on the dose-response curve of PGF2alpha.", 
    "777": "ACE inhibition attenuates alpha-adrenoceptor sensitivity in human vessels. The effect of quinapril, a lipophilic ACEI, was greater than that of enalapril, a hydrophilic ACEI. Lipophilic ACEIs may be more potent in vasodilating effect than hydrophilic ACEIs. Angiotensin II concentration in tissue rather than that in plasma may contribute to the alpha-adrenoceptor sensitivity of the vessels.", 
    "778": "To assess the role of direct ATI receptor antagonism in baroreceptor modulation in man, and to perform a direct comparison of Ang II blockade at the receptor level with that of ACE inhibition.", 
    "779": "Ten healthy male volunteers [mean age (s.d.) 23 (6.9)] pretreated with frusemide therapy (40 mg day(-1) for 3 days prior to each visit) were studied on 3 separate days, 10 days apart, in a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, cross-over fashion. On each study day, subjects were randomly given either a single-dose of enalapril 20 mg, losartan 50 mg or placebo. Baroreceptor function was assessed by measuring changes in blood pressure (BP), pulse interval (RR Int) and heart rate (HR) in response to incremental doses of intravenous phenylephrine infusions (0.2-3.6 microg kg(-1) min(-1)).", 
    "780": "In response to phenylephrine, no significant differences in BP responses were observed with any of the study medications but reflex heart rate responses were significantly increased with both enalapril and losartan compared with placebo (P<0.05). The (RR/AsBP ratio, taken as a measure of baroreceptor sensitivity (BRS) was significantly increased with enalapril 112.2+4.6 ms mmHg (mean+s.d.)] and losartan [11.9+3.6msmmHg(-1)] compared with placebo [9.2+4.5 ms mmHg(-1)]; i.e. enalapril and losartan increased the (RR/(delta sBP ratio by 3.0 ms mmHg(-1) (95%CI 0.5, 5.6; P<0.05) and 2.8 ms mmHg(-1) (95%CI 0.6, 5.0; P< 0.038), respectively. There were however, no significant differences between losartan and enalapril [mean difference 0.25 (95%CI - 1.6, 2.1)].", 
    "781": "The present study confirms observations from animal models that blocking endogenous angiotensin II in man improves baroreceptor function. Both strategies, ATI receptor antagonism and ACE inhibition appear to be equally effective in restoring baroreceptor function in salt-depleted normotensive subjects.", 
    "782": "The influence of 21-day administration of captopril and enalaprilat on barium chloride and adrenaline-induced experimental arrhythmias was assessed. The experiments were performed on rabbits. Arrhythmias were evoked by two alternative arrhythmogen doses. The patterns of disturbances, their frequency and duration were evaluated on the basis of ECG examination. Antiarrhythmic properties of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors administered for 21 days were also compared with their effects after single administration. The results were subjected to statistic analysis. On the basis of the obtained results we were able to establish that repeated administration of enalaprilat decreases the frequency of barium chloride- and adrenaline-induced arrhythmias. Repeated administration of captopril and enalaprilat shortened the duration of adrenaline- and barium chloride-induced arrhythmias. Long-term enalaprilat administration was much more effective in preventing arrhythmias than its single dose, it also proved to be more efficient than either single or repeated administration of captopril.", 
    "783": "The present study was undertaken to investigate the influence of captopril and enalaprilat--two different angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors--on experimental cardiac arrhythmias induced by barium chloride, ouabain or adrenaline. The research was carried out on rabbits. Captopril and enalaprilat were administered only once. Arrhythmias were evoked by three different doses of arrhythmogens: ED50 and two higher ones causing rhythm disturbances in 80-100% rabbits. The patterns of arrhythmias as well as their frequency and duration were evaluated on the basis of ECG examination. The results were subjected to statistic analysis. As a result of our research, we were able to establish that ACE inhibitors, when administered at a single dose, did not influence the patterns but changed the frequency and duration of barium chloride-, adrenaline- or ouabain-induced arrhythmias. Captopril and enalaprilat administered at a single dose decreased the frequency of barium chloride- or ouabain- but not adrenaline-induced arrhythmia. A single administration of captopril and enalaprilat limit the duration of arrhythmias caused by barium chloride, ouabain or adrenaline.", 
    "784": "Acute renal failure and hyperkalemia due to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been described in diabetic patients with other predisposing conditions. The case reported here involves a patient with type 1 diabetes mellitus, microalbuminuria and normal renal function who was treated with enalapril. Two years after initiation of this therapy, at a time when glycemic control was poor, he presented with symptomatic hyperkalemia and impaired renal function accompanied by hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism. This case illustrates that reversible impairment of renal function and hyperkalemia can present after 2 years of treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with precipitating factors.", 
    "785": "The classically recognized functions of the renin-angiotensin system are mediated by type 1 (AT1) angiotensin receptors. Whereas man possesses a single AT1 receptor, there are two AT1 receptor isoforms in rodents (AT1A and AT1B) that are products of separate genes (Agtr1a and Agtr1b). We have generated mice lacking AT1B (Agtr1b -/-) and both AT1A and AT1B receptors (Agtr1a -/-Agtr1b -/-). Agtr1b -/- mice are healthy, without an abnormal phenotype. In contrast, Agtr1a -/-Agtr1b -/- mice have diminished growth, vascular thickening within the kidney, and atrophy of the inner renal medulla. This phenotype is virtually identical to that seen in angiotensinogen-deficient (Agt-/-) and angiotensin-converting enzyme-deficient (Ace -/-) mice that are unable to synthesize angiotensin II. Agtr1a -/-Agtr1b -/- mice have no systemic pressor response to infusions of angiotensin II, but they respond normally to another vasoconstrictor, epinephrine. Blood pressure is reduced substantially in the Agtr1a -/- Agtr1b -/- mice and following administration of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, their blood pressure increases paradoxically. We suggest that this is a result of interruption of AT2-receptor signaling. In summary, our studies suggest that both AT1 receptors promote somatic growth and maintenance of normal kidney structure. The absence of either of the AT1 receptor isoforms alone can be compensated in varying degrees by the other isoform. These studies reaffirm and extend the importance of AT1 receptors to mediate physiological functions of the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "786": "In heart failure (HF), vasoconstrictor systems are activated and endothelium-derived vasodilation is blunted. Bradykinin, a potent vasodilator, may play an important role in this setting. However, it is not known whether its vasodilator effect is modified in HF.", 
    "787": "Fourteen chronically instrumented dogs were studied in the control state and in pacing-induced HF (250 bpm for 3 weeks). The dose-dependent decrease in mean aortic pressure (MAP) induced by acetylcholine was significantly blunted in HF. In contrast, in both control and HF, bradykinin infusion caused similar dose-dependent decreases in MAP and increases in cardiac output (CO). This vasodilator effect of exogenous bradykinin was potentiated similarly in both states by enalaprilat, which blocks both angiotensin conversion and bradykinin degradation. For evaluating the role of endogenous bradykinin, the effects of enalaprilat were compared with those of ciprokiren, a pure renin inhibitor. In control, ciprokiren did not produce any effect. Enalaprilat, however, produced a significant decrease in MAP and a significant increase in CO, which were attributed to the inhibition of bradykinin degradation, because these effects were absent after pretreatment with Hoe 140 (a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist). In contrast, in HF, vasodilator effects of ciprokiren were observed, but enalaprilat produced larger changes in MAP and CO, and after Hoe 140, the hemodynamic effects of enalaprilat were significantly decreased, showing the effects of endogenous bradykinin, which were similar to those measured in control.", 
    "788": "In this model of HF with a blunted endothelium-derived vasodilation, the vasodilator effects of exogenous and endogenous bradykinin are preserved. These results suggest that bradykinin may play an important role in HF, in which vasoconstriction is present and endothelium-dependent vasodilation is blunted.", 
    "789": "The early/asymptomatic stages of heart failure (HF) are characterized by sodium retention secondary to derangement of sodium reabsorption at the proximal nephron level. Because this phenomenon is reversed by ACE inhibition, abnormalities of renal sodium handling may depend on intrarenal changes of angiotensin II (AII)/nitric oxide (NO) levels. Renal hemodynamic reserve (ie, the glomerular vasodilatory response to amino acid infusion) has been proposed as a reliable test to assess in vivo AII/NO balance.", 
    "790": "In this study, the effects of 6 weeks of treatment with 5 mg/d of enalapril or with 50 mg/d of losartan on systemic hemodynamics and renal function were assessed, at baseline and after amino acid infusion (AA), in patients with mild HF (NYHA class I) and in healthy volunteers. Untreated HF patients showed a basal renal function comparable to that of healthy subjects. After AA, glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow significantly increased in healthy subjects (+29.0% and +30.4%, respectively), whereas no vasodilatory response was observed in HF. Although they did not affect basal renal hemodynamics, both enalapril and losartan restored a normal response to AA in HF patients. Blood pressure and heart rate were comparable in HF subjects and healthy subjects at baseline and were not modified by either treatment. Left ventricular ejection fraction was depressed in HF but did not change after either drug. Urinary excretions of cGMP and nitrate (indexes of NO activity in the kidney), comparable in healthy subjects and in HF patients, were unchanged by either enalapril or losartan and did not correlate with renal reserve.", 
    "791": "(1) Renal functional reserve is absent in patients with early/asymptomatic HF and normal renal function and (2) both enalapril and losartan restore a normal vasodilatory response to AA in these patients without affecting basal systemic and renal hemodynamics. These data suggest a major role of AII in the development of early abnormalities in patients with HF.", 
    "792": "Chronic heart failure (CHF) is associated with endothelial dysfunction, including impaired flow-dependent (endothelium-mediated) dilation (FDD). We have previously shown that ACE inhibition improves endothelium-mediated vasodilation in healthy volunteers. The present study was designed to determine whether ACE inhibition improves the impaired FDD in patients with CHF. Because their affinity to tissue ACE may influence the ability of ACE inhibitors to affect endothelial function, we compared the effects of quinaprilat (high affinity to tissue ACE) and enalaprilat (low affinity to tissue ACE) on FDD in patients with CHF.", 
    "793": "High-resolution ultrasound and Doppler were used to measure radial artery diameter and blood flow in patients with CHF. The effects of intra-arterial infusion of quinaprilat 1.6 microg/min (n=15) and enalaprilat 5 microg/min (n=15) were determined at rest and during reactive hyperemia (causing endothelium-mediated dilation) before and after N-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) to inhibit endothelial synthesis of nitric oxide. Quinaprilat improved FDD by >40% (10.2+/-0.6% versus 6.9+/-0.6%; P<0.01), whereas enalaprilat had no effect. In particular, the part of FDD mediated by nitric oxide (ie, inhibited by L-NMMA) was increased by >100% with quinaprilat (5.6+/-0.5% versus 2.5+/-0.5%; P<0.01). Enalaprilat had no effect on FDD even when it was infused twice in the same dose (5 microg/min) and up to 30 microg/min. The effect of sodium nitroprusside on radial artery diameter and blood flow was similar in patients treated with quinaprilat, enalaprilat, and placebo.", 
    "794": "Quinaprilat improves FDD in patients with CHF as the result of increased availability of nitric oxide, whereas enalaprilat does not. This observation suggests that intrinsic differences exist between quinaprilat and enalaprilat that determine the ability to improve endothelium-mediated vasodilation, ie, their different affinity to tissue ACE."
