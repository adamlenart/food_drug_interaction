    "0": "The involvement of the angiotensin-adrenal system as a possible mechanism in the potentiation of morphine analgesia by the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril (SQ 14225), was studied in rats. Captopril pretreatment sensitized the animals to the analgesic effects of morphine while angiotensin II exerted an attenuating influence. These effects, however, were not demonstrable in adrenalectomized animals. Although captopril could inhibit the plasma angiotensin-converting enzyme activity, it appeared to have no significant effect on the brain enzyme. It has been suggested that the effects of captopril and angiotensin II on morphine analgesia are mediated indirectly through their effects on adrenal function.", 
    "1": "N alpha-Phosphoryl-L-alanyl-L-proline is a reversible competitive inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme with a Ki of 1.4 nM. Alkylation of one phosphate oxygen with methyl, ethyl, or benzyl does not change the Ki. The high activity of the O-alkylated inhibitors demonstrates that the two phosphate oxygen anions do not constitute a bidentate ligand of the active site zinc ion. Substitution of valyltryptophan, glycylglycine, or delta-aminovaleric acid for alanylproline in the phosphoramidate raises the Ki to 12 nM, 25 microM, and 178 microM, respectively. Methylation of the alanine nitrogen in phosphorylalanylproline raises the Ki to 29 microM. Polyphosphates inhibit converting enzyme with the following Ki's: phosphate, approximately 300 mM; pyrophosphate, 2 mM; tripolyphosphate, 18 microM; tetrapolyphosphate, 150 microM. The inhibition by tripolyphosphate appears to be competitive and is unaffected by the addition of excess zinc ion. Since the Ki of tripolyphosphate is nearly 10-fold lower than that of N-phosphoryl-delta-aminovaleric acid and is near that of N alpha-phosphorylglycylglycine, its terminal phosphates may bind the zinc site and the cationic site on the enzyme, thus spanning the S1' and S2' sites.", 
    "2": "1. In chloralose anaesthetized rats intravenous administration of captopril (0.5 mg/kg) was followed by an approximately 100-fold decrease in sensitivity to the pressor actions of angiotensin I. Concomitantly there was a 100-fold increase in sensitivity to the depressor effects of bradykinin. 2. Depressor responses to intravenous prostacyclin (PGI2), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) or a low dose of arachidonic acid (1 mg/kg) were not changed by captopril administration, but responses to a high dose of arachidonic acid (3 mg/kg), given either intravenously or into the aortic arch, were enhanced for up to two hours afterwards. 3. Depressor responses to arachidonic acid, both before and after captopril, were inhibited after intravenous indomethacin (1 mg/kg). 4. These results support the hypothesis that increased synthesis of prostaglandins in the circulation contributes to the hypotensive action of captopril.", 
    "3": "Vasodilators lower the blood pressure by decreasing total peripheral resistance. The hemodynamic changes depend on the mix between arteriolar and venous dilatation. Since the compensatory responses are blunted with sympatholytic agents and diuretics, vasodilators can be applied effectively in the treatment of hypertension. Hydralazine and prazosin are used as step III drugs in combination with beta-adrenergic blockers and diuretics. Only hypertensive patients whose blood pressure is not controlled by standard antihypertensive drugs should receive minoxidil or captopril. Hypertensives receiving minoxidil usually require a loop diuretic such as furosemide, in addition to a beta-blocker. Captopril is usually combined with a thiazide diuretic and frequently also with a beta-adrenergic blocker. For hypertensive emergencies diazoxide must be injected intravenously as a bolus. It is contraindicated in patients with dissecting aortic aneurysm or left ventricular failure. Sodium nitroprusside is effective in most cases of hypertensive crisis and must be administered intravenously under continuous observation.", 
    "4": "A modified electron-impact GLC-selected ion monitoring mass spectrometric method for captopril is described. Positive chemical ionization GLC-selected ion monitoring and direct chemical ionization confirms the specificity of this procedure for captopril and establishes the chemical ionization techniques as potential analytical methods. This procedure has been adapted to the simultaneous measurement of captopril and its isotopomer. The results of a pilot oral bioavailability study of four subjects receiving either 100 mg of captopril as a direct compression tablet or a solution concomitantly with a 100-mg solution of isotopomer is discussed.", 
    "5": "Newer methodologies allow us to reexamine the question of the oral administration of peptides. The design of proteolysis-resistant analogues, the synthesis of non-peptide active conformers, and the development of biodegradable plastic pill coatings are approaches that are theoretically possible. Which approach will be best for a given peptide will depend upon the properties of the active hormone and its receptor.", 
    "6": "The hemodynamic effects of captopril (CPT) alone and in combination with the beta-adrenergic receptor agonist terbutaline (TBT) were evaluated in 10 patients with severe chronic congestive heart failure (CHF). The heart rate remained unchanged, while CPT lowered mean systemic blood pressure from 86 to 64 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) and decreased left ventricular filling pressure markedly from 27 to 19 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). The addition of TBT produced no further change in these variables (p greater than 0.05). Simultaneously, CPT augmented cardiac index (CI) from 2.1 to 2.9 L/min/m2 (p less than 0.001) and stroke index (SI) from 27 to 37 ml/beat/m2 (p less than 0.001). Concomitant CPT-TBT further raised CI to 3.2 L/min/m2 and SI to 40 ml/beat/m2 (both less than 0.001). Further, the CPT-effected decline in total systemic vascular resistance from 1577 to 841 dynes . sec . cm-5 (p less than 0.001) was not reduced additionally by CPT-TBT combination (p greater than 0.05). These results indicate than both CPT and TBT markedly augment cardiac function in CHF. Moreover, the salutary effects of the systemic vasodilator appear additive to the beneficial actions of the beta-adrenergic receptor agonist, thereby providing substantial augmentation of the function of the failing heart.", 
    "7": "Four studies were conducted in 36 patients with severe chronic heart failure to compare the central hemodynamic effects of captopril (CPT) to other vasodilator agents. While CPT produced less marked increases in cardiac output than did hydralazine (n = 14), nitroprusside (n = 15), or prazosin (n = 7), it produced decreases in left ventricular filling pressures similar to nitroprusside and prazosin but more than hydralazine. CPT and isosorbide dinitrate (n = 11) produced similar decreases in systemic vascular resistance and left ventricular filling pressure. However, cardiac output increased less with CPT than with nitrates, because heart rate slowed during CPT therapy. In addition, mean right atrial pressure decreased less with CPT than with nitrates, because CPT had minimal effects on limb venous capacitance and pulmonary arteriolar resistance. Alterations in left ventricular pressure-volume relationships likely contributed to the marked decreases in left ventricular filling pressures seen with CPT. In conclusion, the central hemodynamic effects of CPT differ significantly from other vasodilator drugs used in the treatment of heart failure patients. These effects cannot be characterized simply in terms of \"balanced\" peripheral arterial and venous vasodilation; CPT exerts highly complex effects on peripheral vessels as well as having actions independent of its peripheral vasodilator effects.", 
    "8": "The hemodynamic actions of the systemic vasodilators parenteral sodium nitroprusside (NP) and oral captopril (CPT) were compared in 11 patients with severe chronic congestive heart failure (CHF). While two agents produced similar reductions in mean blood pressure (NP, 90 to 70 mm Hg vs CPT, 88 to 74 mm Hg, p greater than 0.05) and left ventricular (LV) filling pressure (NP, 27 to 14 mm Hg vs CPT, 24 to 15 mm Hg, p greater than 0.05), they produce disparate effects on LV pump performance. NP raised cardiac index 35% (2.0 to 2.7 L/min/m2, p less than 0.005), whereas CPT increased this index 16% (1.9 to 2.2 L/min/m2, p less than 0.001). Concomitantly, the 31% elevation of stroke index produced by NP (26 to 34 ml/beat/m2, p less than 0.001) was greater (p less than 0.05) than the 15% rise produced by CPT (26 to 30 ml/beat/m2, p less than 0.001). Simultaneously, stroke work index showed similarly greater augmentation, and total systemic vascular resistance declined more with NP. These findings suggest that oral CPT is a predominant ventricular preload-lowering agent primarily likely to improve dyspnea related to severe pulmonary congestion in patients with advanced chronic CHF.", 
    "9": "The effects of captopril (CPT), an oral angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, on systemic failure (CHF). In 15 patients, CPT decreased mean arterial pressure from 75 +/- 3 to 60 +/- 3 mm Hg associated with a 16% increase in cardiac output, a 24% reduction in systemic vascular resistance, and a 36% decrease in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (all p less than 0.01). Despite the improved cardiac output, renal blood flow, creatinine clearance, and sodium excretion did not rise during the first 2 days of CPT therapy. In eight patients, coronary sinus blood flow diminished from 98 +/- 11 to 82 +/- 9 ml/min (p less than 0.01) following drug administration in association with a fall in arterial pressure and heart rate but no change in coronary sinus oxygen inhibitor failed to improve renal hemodynamics. In addition, initial CPT administration produced a decrease in coronary blood flow that was related to a decrease in myocardial oxygen requirements.", 
    "10": "The mechanisms sustaining high blood pressure in conscious one-kidney, one-clip Goldblatt rats were evaluated with the use of SK&F 64139, a phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase inhibitor capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier and of captopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. The rats were studied 3 weeks after left renal artery clipping and contralateral nephrectomy. During the developmental phase of hypertension, two groups of rats were maintained on a regular salt (RNa) intake, whereas two other groups were given a low salt (LNa) diet. On the day of the experiment, the base-line mean blood pressure measured in the LNa rats (177.4 +/- 5.2 mm Hg, mean +/- S.E., n = 15) was similar to that measured in the RNa rats (178.7 +/- 5.4 mm Hg, n = 16). SK&F 64139 (12.5 mg p.o.) induced a significantly more pronounced (P less than .001) blood pressure decrease in the RNa rats (-25.6 +/- 3.6 mm Hg, n = 8) than in the LNa rats (-4.3 +/- 3.3 mm Hg, n = 7) during a 90-min observation period. On the other hand, captopril (10 mg p.o.) normalized blood pressure in LNa rats (n = 8), but produced only a 13.4 mm Hg blood pressure drop in RNa rats (n = 8). RNa rats treated with SK&F 64139 were found to have decreased phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase activity by an average 80% in selected brain stem nuclei when compared with nontreated rats. No significant difference in plasma catecholamine levels was found between the RNa and LNa rats. These results suggest that, in this experimental model of hypertension, the sodium ion might increase the model of hypertension, the sodium ion might increase the vasoconstrictor contribution of the sympathetic system via a centrally mediated neurogenic mechanism while at the same time it decreases the renin-dependency of the high blood pressure.", 
    "11": "Several derivatives of the potent angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor 5(S)-benzamido-4-oxo-6-phenylhexanoyl-L-proline (1) were synthesized and tested for converting enzyme inhibition activity and blood pressure lowering effects in rats. One compound, 5(S)-benzamido-2(R)-methyl-4-oxo-6-phenylhexanoyl-L-proline (2a), had and I50 against angiotensin converting enzyme of 1.0 x 10(-9) M and is the most potent inhibitor prepared thus far in this class of compounds. Testing of 2a orally at 30 mg/kg for inhibition of the angiotensin I induced blood pressure increase in conscious normotensive rats gave 100% inhibition that required 143 min before the angiotensin I blood pressure response returned to 70% of the pretreatment control response. In the conscious renal hypertensive rat, 2a given orally at a dose of 3 mg/kg caused a lowering of blood pressure that reached its maximum of 40 mmHg 8 h following drug administration.", 
    "12": "This study was designed to determine the roles of the sympathetic nervous system, adrenal medulla, and arginine vasopressin (AVP) in mediating pressor and plasma activity (PRA) responses to intraventricularly (ICV) administered prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in conscious rats. The ICV PGE2 elevated blood pressure and caused increases in PRA, plasma AVP, and plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine. The pressor effect of ICV PGE2 was not influenced by pretreatment with captopril, but was attenuated by the AVP antagonist, d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)AVP, and by phenoxybenzamine, and was completely abolished by the combination of the AVP antagonist and phenoxybenzamine. The PRA response to ICV PGE2 was not affected by bilateral renal denervation or by phenoxybenzamine alone, but was attenuated by propranolol alone and was completely abolished by the combination of propranolol and phenoxybenzamine. Bilateral adrenomedullectomy did not affect the pressor response to ICV PGE2, whereas it attenuated the increase in PRA and completely abolished the increase in plasma epinephrine. These results suggest that the pressor effect of ICV PGE2 is the result of increased sympathetic nervous system activity and is dependent on the stimulation of alpha-adrenergic receptors and on AVP release. The pressor response to ICV PGE2 is accompanied by but not dependent on an increase in PRA. The renin-stimulating effect of centrally administered PGE2 is, at least in part, dependent on beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation by increased circulating catecholamines.", 
    "13": "The effects of captopril and angiotensin II on adrenergic neurotransmission have been studied in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). In a pithed rat preparation, vasoconstrictor responses evoked by spinal stimulation were greater in SHR than WKY (p less than 0.01). Captopril reduced responses to electrical stimulation and this reduction was greater in the SHR (p less than 0.001). Bilateral nephrectomy reduced the vasoconstrictor responses to nerve stimulation in both strains of rat and abolished the effects of captopril. In an isolated perfused mesenteric artery WKY (p less than 0.05). Angiotensin II potentiated responses from both strains of rat, however the amplitude of the potentiation was greater in preparations from the SHR than those from WKY (p less than 0.002). Captopril (30 mg/kg by mouth) reduced blood pressure in conscious SHR over a 5-day dosing period. In WKY rats, no hypertensive action of captopril was observed. However, in another normotensive strain, the Alderley Park Wistar rat (APW), captopril lowered blood pressure. Plasma renin activity was not significantly different among these three strains of rat. The APW have previously been shown to be very sensitive to the adrenergic potentiating actions of angiotensin II. Captopril thus lowers blood pressure in SHR and APW, and both these strains are sensitive to the adrenergic potentiating actions of angiotensin II. It does not lower blood pressure in WKY, which is relatively insensitive to these actions of the octapeptide. Therefore, the hypotensive action of captopril in the rat may be due to its interference with the adrenergic potentiating effect of angiotensin II.", 
    "14": "In small (0.5 mg/kg) subcutaneous doses, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, greatly enhanced drinking in response to caval ligation in the rat. Drinking was not secondary to urinary water loss since the rats developed a substantial positive fluid balance. High (50 mg/kg) subcutaneous doses of captopril reduced drinking to a level below that following caval ligation alone. This effect could be mimicked by giving repeated intracerebroventricular injections of captopril (total amount 110 micrograms) to rats treated with the lower subcutaneous dose of captopril. With this combination, therefore, not only did the lower dose enhancement disappear, the basal caval ligation drinking response was also reduced with a total dose of captopril of less than 2% of the higher subcutaneous dose alone. These results show that, when conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II is prevented in the brain as well as systemically, drinking in response to caval ligation is reduced although not entirely prevented. The original report that such drinking is multifactorial, depending on angiotensin as well as nonangiotensin mechanisms, is confirmed.", 
    "15": "Thirty-three hypertensive patients with a wide range of renal function were studied during initiation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition with captopril to evaluate changes in potassium levels concomitant with reduction of aldosterone excretion. Ten patients (Group I) with low levels of plasma renin activity had no change in either aldosterone excretion or potassium during the first week of therapy. Twenty-three other patients (Group II) had decreased aldosterone excretion of an average of 63 percent, often reversing secondary hyperaldosteronism. This was associated with a rise in serum potassium from 3.6 +/- 0.1 to 4.4 +/- 0.1 mEq/liter (p less than 0.001). Serum potassium levels during captopril therapy were inversely related to glomerular filtration rate (creatinine clearance) and transiently exceeded 6.0 mEq/liter in markedly azotemic subjects. Despite rising potassium levels, nine patients had reduced aldosterone excretion to subnormal levels, sometimes for many months. During initiation of converting-enzyme inhibition, potassium-sparing agents and supplements should be discontinued and serum potassium levels should be monitored closely, particularly in patients with imparied renal function.", 
    "16": "To more fully delineate the effects of captopril (CPT) on cardiac size and function in patients with chronic congestive heart failure (CHF), we performed blood pool scintigraphy in conjunction with hemodynamic measurements during the initiation of vasodilator therapy and repeat scintigraphy after 2 and 12 weeks. Measurements of both right and left ventricular volumes and ejection fraction were made before and 90 minutes after the first 25 mg dose of CPT in 14 patients. Overall, heart rate fell modestly, from 82 +/- 10 to 77 +/- 11 bpm (p less than 0.01), while mean arterial pressure dropped considerably, from 86 +/- 10 to 73 +/- 13 mm Hg (p less than 0.01). Left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes fell from 388 +/- 81 to 350 +/- 77 and 319 +/- 75 to 271 +/- 75 ml (both p less than 0.01). Right ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes also decreased. The left ventricular ejection fraction rose modestly but significantly, from 19 +/- 6% to 22 +2- 5% (p less than 0.01), as did right ventricular ejection fraction (25 +/- 9% to 29 +/- 11%, p less than 0.01). Simultaneous hemodynamic measurements demonstrated corresponding decreases in left and right ventricular filling pressures (24 +/- 10 to 17 +/- 9 to 10 +/- 5 to 6 +/- 5 mm Hg, respectively, both p less than 0.001). The slight increase in cardiac and stroke indices at 90 minutes, from 2.0 +/- 0.5 to 2.1 +/- 0.4 and 25 +/- 8 to 27 +/- 7 ml/m2, respectively, were not significant, although both indices rose significantly at the time of each individual's peak effect. Six patients were discharged on CPT and underwent follow-up nuclear studies: the acute decrease in ventricular volumes were sustained, as was the slight improvement in ejection fractions. These findings indicated that the major acute effect of CPT in CHF is a reduction in the preload of both ventricles. This reduction in diastolic volumes and pressures persists during chronic therapy.", 
    "17": "Both postural abnormalities and autonomic dysfunction have been identified in patients with chronic congestive heart failure (CHF). However, the effect of long-term vasodilator therapy on these phenomena has not been assessed. In this study the hemodynamic and plasma norepinephrine (PNE) responses to upright posture, as well as the cold pressor test and Valsalva's maneuver in 12 patients with severe chronic CHF during both acute and long-term captopril (CPT) therapy, were evaluated. This revealed an absence of the normal hemodynamic adjustments to upright posture and a blunted response of PNE. The heart rate and blood pressure responses to the cold pressor test and Valsalva's maneuver were similarly blunted. The reflex adjustments of systemic resistance during tilt improved with CPT therapy, but the absence of reflex tachycardia in the upright posture persisted. Additionally, there was improvement of the PNE response, and the responses of heart rate and blood pressure to the cold pressor test were virtually normalized during long-term CPT therapy. The abnormal response to the Valsalva maneuver persisted. In conclusion, hemodynamic and reflex-mediated responses to upright posture and the standard assessment of autonomic control mechanisms revealed abnormal patterns in heart failure. While the hemodynamic adjustment to postural changes and sympathetic responsiveness were improved with CPT, complete correction of these abnormalities did not occur. Whether the improvement was a nonspecific vasodilator effect or the result of specific CPT therapy remains to be determined.", 
    "18": "Although the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system has been implicated in the pathophysiology of chronic heart failure, the factors influencing the extent of renin activity have not been clarified. In the present study, we evaluated 34 patients with severe chronic congestive heart failure in terms of baseline plasma renin activity (PRA). No uniform relationships between PRA and urinary sodium excretion have been established. Although baseline PRA did not correlate with the baseline hemodynamic values, the extent of hemodynamic improvement following acute oral captopril (CPT) therapy (25 mg) was highly correlated with baseline PRA. The onset of action was rapid, so that the initial acute response could be readily assessed and at the same time could be used as a means to estimate baseline renin-angiotension-aldosterone activity. For long-term therapy, however, the response to CPT must be assessed in the context of several potentially simultaneous factors that might either enhance or compromise its effectiveness.", 
    "19": "Twelve patients with severe chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) underwent simultaneous evaluation of the pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and neurohumoral actions of a single 25 mg oral dose of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril (CPT). Following drug administration, which raised plasma renin activity (PRA) and thereby indicated significant ACE inhibition, both free (unchanged) and total CPT (including active metabolites) were detectable in the blood with 40 minutes and peak blood levels of the agent were recorded 1 hour after CPT. Total CPT concentration was higher and persisted longer than free CPT, which became virtually nondetectable 8 hours after ingestion. Concomitantly, left ventricular function was markedly augmented by the oral ACE inhibition in all patients, with the magnitude of this improvement being closely related to the baseline PRA. Thus, the overall hemodynamic response to CPT, which rapidly appears in the bloodstream following drug intake in patients with advanced CHF, is a function of the extent of baseline renin-angiotensin-aldosterone activity.", 
    "20": "Although many studies have shown that captopril (CPT) provides acute hemodynamic improvement in patients with severe congestive heart failure (CHF) at rest, little information is available concerning exercise hemodynamic responses to CPT or the effect of this drug on exercise tolerance in CHF. Therefore, we evaluated the hemodynamic effects of CPT at rest and during upright bicycle exercise in 15 patients with stable CHF. CPT (25 to 50 mg) reduces both resting heart rate and mean arterial pressure (84 +/- 11 to 78 +/- 7 bpm, p less than 0.025 and 85 +/- 9 to 64 +/- mm Hg, p less than 0.001). Concomitantly, left ventricular filling pressure dropped dramatically (26 +/- 9 to 15 +/- 7 mm Hg, p less than 0.001), while cardiac and stroke indices rose (2.0 +/- 0.5 to 2.5 +/- 0.6 L/min/m2, p less than 0.001, and 25 +/- 8 to 33 +/- 7 ml/m2, p less than 0.001). Similar directional changes occurred during exercise, with heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and left ventricular filling pressure at maximum exercise being less (123 +/- 15 to 115 +/- 16 bpm, p less than 0.01; 93 +/- 17 to 86 +/- 14 mm Hg, p less than 0.05; and 35 +/- 10 to 30 11 mm Hg, p less than 0.001, respectively) after CPT ingestion. Peak exercise cardiac index rose slightly (3.6 +/- 0.7 to 3.9 +/- 0.6 L/min/m2) but not significantly. Six patients followed long term on CPT underwent elective recatheterization after 3 months. In these, the beneficial hemodynamic changes seen acutely persisted or further improvement was noted, both at rest and during exercise. Most impressively, peak exercise cardiac index rose from 3.6 +/- 0.7 to 4.6 +/- 1.0 L/min/m2 (p less than 0.05), and this was associated with an increase in exercise duration (8.0 +/- 2.2 to 11.5 +/- 1.4 minutes, p less than 0.05) and exercise work load (332 +/- 32 to 468 +/- 52 kp-m/min, p less than 0.05). These findings indicate that in patients with severe CHF, oral CPT provides markedly beneficial augmentation of cardiac function during activity as well as at rest; moreover, chronic CPT therapy substantially increases exercise capacity in this setting.", 
    "21": "The acute hemodynamic effects and long-term therapeutic actions of low doses of the oral angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril (CPT) were evaluated in 18 patients with severe chronic congestive heart failure (CHF). Increasing doses of 1, 2.5, 6.25, 12.5, and 25 mg of CPT were given at 2-hour intervals. Increased stroke volume index (SVI) and reduced mean pulmonary capillary wedge (PCW) pressure occurred at 1 hour (p less than 0.05) with an associated decline of blood pressure. Maximal hemodynamic improvement for the group was seen at 6 and 7 hours following the 6.25 and 12.5 mg doses when SVI was elevated 35% and mean PCW pressure decreased 40% from control. CPT in doses of 12.5 to 50 mg every 8 hours was continued long term in these 18 CHF patients. Four patients died, and one was noncompliant; drug therapy was withdrawn in two patients with symptomatic hypertension and in one patient who experienced an alteration in taste. The remaining 10 patients showed significant improvement in symptoms and treadmill exercise duration at 3 months after CPT therapy was started. Moreover, repeat hemodynamic measurements were similar to optimal measurements obtained during the initial study. In a further study, the acute hemodynamic and hormonal effect of sequentially randomized 5 mg prazosin and 25 mg CPT were compared in 10 CHF patients. While both drugs reduced PCW pressure and vascular resistance, CPT effects were greater. Further, CPT alone effected a small rise in cardiac index and minor decline in heart rate, and CPT diminished aldosterone levels and increased plasma renin activity while prazosin did not.", 
    "22": "The efficacy of chronic ambulatory captopril (CPT) therapy was evaluated over an 18-month period in 36 patients with refractory chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) by cardiac catheterization, treadmill exercise, nuclear scintigraphy, echocardiography, and symptomatology. Clinical improvement to New York Heart Association functional class I or class II was observed in 63% of the patients (20 of 32) after 2 months of treatment; this amelioration of CHF symptoms was sustained in 63% of the patients (10 of 16) at 18 months. Exercise tolerance increased in 64% of the patients (16 of 25) at early follow-up and in 79% (11 of 14) at late follow-up. Univariate analysis revealed that the pre- and post-CPT stroke work indices (SWI) and the post-CPT cardiac index related to favorable long-term clinical response. Fourteen CHF patients (39%) died during the 18-month follow-up. Univariate analysis revealed that the pretreatment SWI, right atrial pressure, plasma norepinephrine concentration, and echocardiographic shortening fraction were significant predictors of mortality. Multivariate analysis indicated that the SWI was the principal determinant of survival: the 18-month cumulative survival rate for CHF patients with a SWI less than 32 gm . m/m2 was 44% compared to 88% when the SWI was greater than 32 gm . m/m2. Thus, CPT results in sustained symptomatic and functional improvements in patients with advanced CHF, but the mortality remains high and is primarily related to the severity of cardiac dysfunction.", 
    "23": "The oral angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (CPT) produces beneficial hemodynamic and clinical responses in patients with chronic congestive heart failure (CHF). Cardiac output and stroke volume increase, along with a decrease in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, indicating improved left ventricular function. During maintenance CPT therapy, the beneficial hemodynamic and clinical effects appear to be sustained. Improved left ventricular pump function with CPT is associated with decreased metabolic cost, as myocardial oxygen consumption consistently decreases in proportion to the decrease in myocardial oxygen demand. Myocardial ischemia occurs infrequently, as is evident from the abnormal myocardial lactate metabolism. Hypotension appears to be the major adverse effect, particularly after the first dose. However, with dose titration and the use of a smaller initial dose, a marked precipitous fall in blood pressure can be avoided in the majority of patients. Thus, CPT may prove to be a useful agent in the vasodilator therapy of chronic CHF.", 
    "24": "Successful ambulatory afterload reduction therapy of severe chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) required the extensive evaluation of hemodynamic effects of vasodilator agents, precise characterization of differential cardiocirculatory actions, and objective confirmation of extended salutary improvements of the heart failure state. This article describes results of a series of investigations with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril (CPT) in several patients with severe CHF. CPT causes predominant peripheral venodilation, resulting in marked decline in elevated left ventricular preload and modest augmentation of the depressed cardiac output. These hemodymanic effects of oral CPT are similar to the effects of nitroprusside and prazosin on increased ventricular preload, but the latter vasodilators cause greater rise in low cardiac pump output. Importantly, the beneficial cardiocirculatory action of oral CPT provided prolonged cardiac benefits with symptomatic improvements confirmed by objective enhancement in left ventricular function documented by cardiac catheterization, echocardiography, nuclear scintigraphy, and treadmill exercise. Thus, ACE inhibition with oral CPT successfully provides marked long-term augmentation of cardiac performance and clinical status in refractory CHF.", 
    "25": "Interruption of the renin-aldosterone system with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (CEI) should result in a low aldosterone secretion, but most investigators have measured aldosterone production only indirectly by plasma aldosterone (PA) levels or urinary metabolites. We evaluated the effects of CEI of the aldosterone secretion rate (ASR) and compared them with PA, urinary tetrahydroaldosterone (THA), plasma renin activity (PRA), and electrolyte balance in six normotensive subjects in a metabolic unit during a control period (5 days) and during administration of 10 mg/day enalapril for 28 days. Our results demonstrated that (1) the ASR did not decline until after 1 wk of CEI therapy and this was reflected by a corresponding decline in the urine potassium:sodium ratio, (2) upright PA levels at day 1 declined, but supine PA levels were unchanged, (3) THA excretion remained essentially unchanged and the THA:ASR ratio rose progressively during therapy, (4) PRA rose and was maximal on day 3, but subsequently declined. In conclusion, enalapril-induced hypoaldosteronism required several days to become demonstrable and this was not accurately assessed by PA or THA--possibly due, in part, to altered aldosterone metabolism. The simultaneous decline in both PRA and ASR could be due to a decrease in renin substrate. Caution is therefore warranted when assessing aldosterone secretion indirectly by either PA levels or urinary metabolites during CEI therapy.", 
    "26": "Nineteen hypertensive patients were treated with increasing doses of the new angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor MK 421. Twenty milligrams orally reduced blood pressure from 180/112 +/- 6.8/3.6 (mean +/- SEM) to 160/100 +/- 6.5/3.3 mm Hg (p less than 0.005) while heart rate increased from 75 +/- 2 to 87 +/- 3 beats/min (p less than 0.005). Plasma converting enzyme activity was still markedly reduced 24 h following 2.5, 5, 10, or 20 mg MK 421 p.o. (p less than 0.001). In nine patients treated with 20 mg b.i.d. for up to 10 months, blood pressure was controlled, with the association of hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg q.d. in five. However, 12 to 16 h following the preceding drug administration, plasma angiotensin II and aldosterone were back to base-line levels. Analysis of plasma angiotensin II-renin relationships strongly suggests that converting enzyme blockade is not complete even 4 h after 20 mg MK 421 and starts to wear off already at 12 h. Thus, MK 421 20 mg taken orally twice daily, effectively reduces blood pressure, but does not constantly suppress plasma angiotensin II and aldosterone. Whether its long duration of action makes once daily administration possible has not yet been established.", 
    "27": "We studied the possible role of renal prostaglandins (PGs) in captopril-induced hypotension, renal vasodilation, and increased renin secretion using anesthetized dogs. An intravenous injection of 1 mg/kg captopril significantly decreased blood pressure, increased renal blood flow, and raised the renin secretion rate (RSR). These effects of captopril were similar in indomethacin-pretreated (5 mg/kg, i.v.) and in untreated dogs. Captopril administration did not significantly affect the renal PGE2 secretion rate (p greater than 0.10). These results suggest that under our experimental conditions, captopril-induced hypotension, renal vasodilation, and increased RSR may not be due to renal PGE2 release. This does not rule out the possibility that these effects of captopril may be mediated by alterations in the level of circulating bradykinin.", 
    "28": "The coronary hemodynamic effects of vasodilator therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (captopril and teprotide) were studied in 11 patients with ischemic heart disease and severe congestive heart failure (CHF). Over 2 hours, systemic vascular resistance was reduced from 2,408 +/- 240 to 1,715 +/- 170 dynes . s . cm-5 (p less than 0.001), and cardiac output improved 18%, resulting in lower arterial pressure (101 +/- 8 to 86 +/- 5 mm Hg, p less than 0.001) and left ventricular filling pressure (30 +/- 2 to 21 +/- 2 mm Hg, p less than 0.001). Coronary sinus thermodilution blood flow paralleled perfusion pressure but did not significantly vary overall (160 +/- 20 to 133 +/- 12 ml/min, difference not significant [NS]). Coronary vascular resistance was unchanged. Although the left ventricular stroke work index rose slightly (37.7 +/- 8.8 to 41.3 +/- 7.9 g l m/m2, p less than 0.05), there was no change in the coronary arteriovenous oxygen content difference (10.8 +/- 1.0 to 10.4 +/- 1.0 ml/10 ml, NS) or calculated myocardial oxygen consumption (16.4 +/- 1.9 to 13.9 /- 1.6 ml/min, NS). The heart rate-systolic blood pressure product declined significantly during this period (8,824 +/- 703 to 7,087 +/- 514 beats . mm Hg, p less than 0.02); this relief of cardiac effort was a function of the pretreatment plasma renin activity. A derived index of external myocardial efficiency improved 37% (19 +/- 3 to 26 +/- 6, p less than 0.05), reflecting greater left ventricular work without increased oxygen demand. Enhancement of myocardial performance after converting enzyme inhibition appears dependent on reduction of angiotensin-mediated ventricular afterload and preload. The lack of coronary vasomotor effects in patients with advanced ischemic cardiomyopathy may reflect limited coronary vascular reserve. Improvement of heart failure in these patients developed without evidence of myocardial ischemia, since balance was maintained between oxygen supply and demand.", 
    "29": "In 42 patients with moderate-to-severe congestive heart failure (CHF), the acute hemodynamic and neurohumoral response to the converting enzyme inhibitors (CEIs) captopril (CPT) and teprotide were measured. Plasma renin activity (PRA) was elevated and correlated with control plasma norepinephrine (PNE) but not with any of the control hemodynamics. Acutely after CEIs, significant (p less than 0.001) decreases in right atrial pressure, pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), total systemic vascular resistance (SVR), pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), and heart rate (HR, p less than 0.002), as well as an increase in cardiac index (p less than 0.001), were observed. Control PRA correlated with the degree of hemodynamic change for PAP (r = -0.64), PCWP (r = -0.66), SVR (r = -0.61), and PVR (r = -0.61). Long-term CPT therapy in 12 of these patients resulted in symptomatic improvement and a marked increase in exercise tolerance (7.4 to 10.4 minutes, p less than 0.009). These data suggest that CEIs effect beneficial acute hemodynamic improvements in depressed left ventricular function, leading to substantial reduction in disabling symptomatology and augmentation of exercise capacity in patients with stable severe CHF. Thus, CPT appears to provide well-tolerated, effective long-term ambulatory vasodilator therapy for advanced cardiac dysfunction.", 
    "30": "In spontaneoulsy hypertensive rats (SHR), the hypotensive effect of captopril (30 mg/kg/day per os for 4 days), which inhibits the converting enzyme when given orally was significantly potentiated rather than suppressed by aprotonin (100,000 KIU/day s.c. for 7 days), but was not affected by indomethacin. These findings suggest that neither the kallikrein-kinin system nor the prostaglandin system is involved in any of the hypotensive actions of captopril in SHR other than the inhibition of the converting enzyme.", 
    "31": "The effects of long-term therapy with captopril (CPT) were studied in 11 patients with severe chronic congestive heart failure (CHF). At initiation of therapy, cardiac index increased from 1.88 +/- 0.56 to 2.12 +/- L/min/m2 (p less than 0.05), while pulmonary capillary wedge pressure decreased from 27.9 +/- 7.2 to 17.8 +/- 7.6 mm Hg (p less than 0.01). This improvement in resting cardiac performance was maintained during maximal exercise; however, maximal oxygen uptake was not acutely increased by CPT. During chronic therapy, 6 of 11 patients showed symptomatic improvements; however, only three of these six patients demonstrated an increase in maximal oxygen uptake, which was measured at an average of 13.2 weeks following initiation of therapy. Five patients did not improve clinically during chronic therapy. In these patients, hemodynamic measurements that had improved initially after CPT returned to baseline values during chronic therapy. The addition of prazosin to chronic CPT therapy elicited a beneficial hemodynamic response in all five patients. Thus, the results of long-term therapy with CPT are variable in patients with severe CHF, and symptomatic improvement does not always correlate with objective measurement of exercise capacity. Combined alpha-adrenergic blockade and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition appears safe in patients who failed to exhibit a sustained improvement on CPT alone.", 
    "32": "The clinical responses to captopril, an oral converting-enzyme inhibitor, in five patients with resistant heart failure are described. Earlier treatment consisting of digoxin, diuretics and vasodilators had proven inadequate, and each patient was considered end-stage. Captopril therapy resulted in clear-cut improvements in exercise tolerance, a decrease in decubitus and effort dyspnoea, increased energy, a sense of well-being, and enabled all to become ambulatory. Captopril is a major advance in the treatment of patients with severe resistant heart failure.", 
    "33": "Inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in patients suffering from renovascular hypertension results in lowering of the blood-pressure. The development of captopril, an orally active ACE inhibitor and the structure-activity relationship of captopril analogues are described. Some side effects of captopril were attributed to the presence of an SH-group in the molecule. This led to the development of a series of non-mercapto ACE inhibitors derived from captopril. One of them, enalapril, a potent ACE inhibitor with a long duration of antihypertensive action, is now tested in clinical trials.", 
    "34": "Using X-ray and NMR data relating to the conformation of the antihypertensive, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, and structure--activity relationships of analogues, it has been possible to postulate with the aid of computer graphics, the orientation of the three functions, the thiol, the terminal carboxyl and the carbonyl group which are involved in binding to the enzyme. Bicyclic mimetics of captopril, with related arrays of these functions, have been designed and synthesized. Compounds with the closest approximation to the array in captopril are the most active inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme, in vitro.", 
    "35": "Captopril (Capoten; Squibb) is a specific orally active antagonist of peptidyl-dipeptide carboxyhydrolase, the enzyme which converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II and which inactivates bradykinin. Captopril therefore reduces blood pressure in a variety of animal models of hypertension. In 96 studies on 1570 patients, captopril has been shown to be superior to placebo and equivalent to either propranolol or a diuretic in the treatment of essential hypertension. In the management of severe treatment-resistant hypertension, the response to captopril (alone or in combination with a diuretic and/or propranolol) was better than the response to standard triple therapy. Captopril, with digitalis and a diuretic, also improved the haemodynamic and clinical status of patients with refractory congestive heart failure. Side-effects include skin rashes (15%), proteinuria (1,1%, or 0,4% of patients with no prior renal disease) and the nephrotic syndrome (0,9%, or 0,3% of patients with no prior renal disease). Nearly all patients with the nephrotic syndrome in whom renal biopsies were performed were found to have membranous glomerulopathy. Neutropenia (total white cell count less than 1,000/microliter) was found in 33 of over 6,000 patients (0,4%), but in all cases there were other possible causes for this. Captopril is the first of an important group of antihypertensive and afterload-reducing drugs; its major indications are likely to be in the treatment of refractory severe hypertension or congestive heart failure.", 
    "36": "1. The blood pressure and renal blood flow response to captopril (0.2 mg/kg, intravenously) was studied in low salt, normal, and high salt fed conscious dogs, and in a group of DOCA-salt treated dogs. 2. Mean arterial blood pressure was decreased and renal blood flow increased most in the low salt group, but significant changes were also obtained in the normal group. The high salt and DOCA-salt groups were only marginally affected by captopril. 3. When the data from all four groups of dogs were subjected to regression analysis, there was a significant relationship (r = 0.68) between the prevailing plasma renin activity and the increase in renal blood flow caused by captopril. 4. The results suggest that renal vasodilatation resulting from converting enzyme inhibition is mainly due to a decreased in the level of circulating angiotensin II, and that even in the normal conscious dog the prevailing plasma renin activity can affect blood pressure and renal blood flow.", 
    "37": "1. 14C-Captopril (50 mg/kg) administered orally to pregnant rats resulted in radioactivity passing the placental barrier into foetuses and amniotic fluid. Two hours after dosing, the mean (+/- S.E.M.) concentration of total radioactivity was 0.97 +/- 0.07 micrograms equiv. of captopril/g in foetuses and 7.8 +/- 0.54 micrograms equiv./g in maternal blood. The mean concentration of unchanged captopril at this time was 0.22 +/- 0.04 micrograms/g in foetuses and 2.4 +/- 0.27 micrograms/g in maternal blood. Results obtained by whole-body autoradiography generally were consistent with those obtained by measuring radioactivity in excised tissues. 2. Radioactivity was also found in suckling pups and in the milk of th dams. Autoradiographs of the pups showed detectable radioactivity in the brain; as no radioactivity was detectable in the brain of the dam, it appears that the blood-brain barrier was not fully developed in seven-day-old pups.", 
    "38": "Ten patients with severe chronic heart failure were given prazosin 5 mg and captopril 25 mg in random order on consecutive days. Small increases in cardiac index and reductions in heart rate were effected by both drugs, but these alterations and the accompanying increases in stroke volume index were significant only following captopril. Both drugs significantly reduced mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and mean right atrial pressure and also systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure, the effect of captopril being greater than that of prazosin. Following captopril, plasma aldosterone levels were significantly reduced and plasma renin activity increased from control values, whereas prazosin did not alter these hormone indices.", 
    "39": "Nine patients with resistant hypertension received captopril for 12 months. Five received captopril alone, four required additional therapy. In the former, mean blood pressure fell from 109 +/- 4.2 mm Hg to 84 +/- 7.5 mm Hg (P less than 0.025) after seven days. A rise to 101 +/- 19 mm Hg was noted at six and 12 months. Total peripheral resistance fell at seven days but returned to levels above control at six and 12 months. Cardiac index was 3.21 +/- 0.55 liters/min/m2 before treatment, 3.27 +/- 0.56 liters/min/m2 at seven days, and 2.17 +/- 4.0 liters/min/m2 (P less than 0.025) at 12 months. However, forearm blood flow rose from subnormal levels during the 12 months of observation, suggesting a persistent effect on the arterioles of the extremities. Plasma converting enzyme activity was significantly reduced at seven days but was above control levels at six and 12 months. However, plasma renin activity remained elevated, and plasma aldosterone concentration was significantly reduced. The fall in mean blood pressure was not related to the change in plasma converting enzyme activity in patients receiving captopril alone (five patients) or with diuretic (two patients). In the presence of beta-adrenergic blockade and volume depletion (two patients), changes in mean blood pressure appeared to be related to changes in converting enzyme activity. The data suggest that patients with essential hypertension whose blood pressure was not adequately controlled by previous medications may initially respond to captopril with a fall in blood pressure and total peripheral resistance. However, in certain individuals, these effects diminish with time despite addition of diuretics and beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents.", 
    "40": "Severe systemic hypertension may complicate the postoperative course of patients undergoing surgical repair for coarctation of the aorta. The sympathetic and the renin-angiotensin systems have been demonstrated as underlying mechanisms for this paradoxical phenomenon (Farrell et al., 1979; Rocchini et al., 1979). We recently utilized captopril, a competitive inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme, with success in the management of severe hypertension that developed in a 15-year-old male after successful surgical repair for coarctation of the aorta. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the use of captopril for the treatment of this paradoxical phenomenon.", 
    "41": "Paradoxical glucose-induced hyperkalemia (GIH) was elicited exclusively in the upright position during captopril treatment in four hypertensive patients (Group 3) without impaired glucose tolerance in three. Inhibited aldosterone production and inappropriate plasma aldosterone responses to increasing serum potassium may have been responsible for the captopril potentiated GIH. Similar GIH was found in four non-insulin dependent diabetic control patients with mineralocorticoid insufficiency (Group 1) but without captopril treatment, which could be prevented by desoxycorticosterone. Normal serum potassium responses to glucose, uninfluenced by desoxycorticosterone were shown in four untreated hypertensive control patients (Group 2).", 
    "42": "Analysis of urinary captopril was necessary for dosage form bioavailability and dose titration studies. The necessity for long-term storage of samples prior to analysis and the presence of an oxidation-prone thiol of captopril required development of an acid-chelate stabilization method for urinary captopril. An electrochemical reduction released disulfide-conjugated captopril for thiol colorimetry. Of several rugged reduction cells evaluated, one with a porous glass disk separating the anode and the mercury pool cathode was preferred. Methylene chloride partitions from acidified salt-saturated urines, before and after reduction, allowed the measurement of free and disulfide-conjugated captopril. The drug partitioned into the solvent, whereas the aqueous phase retained acid protonated, amino group-bearing thiols like cystine. Subsequent solvent evaporation volatilized other potential colorimetric interferences. An automated thiol colorimetry of 25 samples/hr was developed for analysis of the aqueous reconstitutes. Results were confirmed by a subsequently developed HPLC method with electrochemical detection.", 
    "43": "Captopril 12.5 to 50 mg as a single dose was given to six patients with pulmonary hypertension secondary to collagen vascular disease. Total pulmonary resistance was decreased in four patients from 19% to 39%, but mean pulmonary artery pressure (63 +/- 15 mm Hg) was not decreased, probably because of the concurrent increase in cardiac output from 21% to 52% (2p less than 0.05). The systemic arterial pressure was slightly decreased due to the decrease in total systemic resistance. Control plasma renin activity ranged from 0.15 to 16 ng/ml/hr and was increased during captopril from 19% to 356%. These results, although preliminary, suggest that captopril may be beneficial in certain patients with pulmonary hypertension secondary to collagen vascular disease.", 
    "44": "Ten patients with refractory congestive heart failure (CHF) were followed serially for systemic hemodynamic (radionuclide techniques) and M-mode echocardiographic changes during long-term captopril therapy with optimum doses. After 1 week of maintenance captopril therapy, all patients were clinically improved. This was associated with a significant (p less than 0.05) reduction of total blood volume (-6 +/- 2% N), mean blood pressure (-9 +/- 3 mm Hg), and peak systolic left ventricular wall stress (-50 +/- 19 X 10(3) dynes/cm2). At the end of 2 months of maintained therapy, mean blood pressure reduction was -12 +/- 4 mm Hg (p less than 0.05); further hemodynamic improvement was manifested by a significant shortening of pulmonary mean transit time (-3.7 +2- 1.33 seconds, p less than 0.05). Echocardiographic data revealed an increase in end-diastolic septal wall thickness (+0.13 +/- 0.05, p less than 0.05) and left ventricular posterior wall thickness (+0.13 +/- 0.03, p less than 0.05), and further reduction in peak systolic stress (-84 +/- 23 X 10(3) dynes/cm2, p less than 0.05). The present study indicates the importance of measuring peak systolic wall stress in the follow-up of CHF patients. Moreover, we found that for functional circulatory evaluation during vasodilator therapy, the radionuclide first-pass methods were more helpful than both M-mode echocardiography and radionuclide gated blood pool techniques.", 
    "45": "Several vasodilating agents have been used for the treatment of primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH). However, no effective therapy is currently available for this distressful disease. We tried to use an angiotensin-I converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, for one woman suffering from PPH. Her initial treatment with furosemide, digoxin and spironolactone had shown little effect. Further administration of captopril improved her clinical condition from NYHA IV to II and made it possible to treat her at our out-clinic. No adverse effect has been found. We would like to appreciate captopril as one of the effective drugs in the treatment of PPH.", 
    "46": "Conjugated estrogens injected into the lateral brain ventricle in awake rats elicited behavioral excitation and vasopressor responses. Magnitude of pressor responses was greater in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) than in normotensive Kyoto Wistar rats (WKY). Pressor responses in SHR were abolished by central pretreatments of either captopril or angiotensin II analog. Under urethane anesthesia, conjugated estrogens still produced greater pressor responses in SHR, but accompanying increases in sympathetic nerve firings were the same in both WKY and SHR. These results suggest that while centrally-administered estrogens may activate the brain renin-angiotensin system to increase sympathetic nerve firing and thereby elevated blood pressure, SHR have larger pressor responses only because peripheral vascular reactivity has been increased.", 
    "47": "Effects of MK 421, a new angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, were studied in normal men and patients. MK 421 was given at 0900 h as a single oral dose of 20 mg, to 5 normal men and 2 patients with essential hypertension and 10 mg to a patient with Bartter's syndrome, in the recumbent position. In all of them blood pressure (BP) fell, plasma angiotensin I (Pl AI) and plasma renin activity (PRA) increased, and plasma aldosterone (PA) decreased from 2 h to 6 h. Maximum effects were observed at 4 or 6 h. Then the effects attenuated gradually but still remained at 24 h. In the same 5 normal men angiotensin I (AI) was infused iv at a rate of 20 ng/kg . min from 0900 h to 1500 h, from 2030 h to 2100 h, and the next morning from 0830 to 0900 h. At first the BP rose and PA increased. The onset of the BP fall was at 35, 55, 60, 70 and 85 min in each subject, respectively. Then the BP and PA began to decrease and the Pl AI and PRA began to increase. The maximum effects were observed at 4 or 6 h. Then these inhibitory effects on the AI were attenuated but still remained at 24 h. The 2 patients with essential hypertension and a patient with malignant hypertension was treated with MK 421 at a daily doses of 5 to 40 mg for 2 to 6 months. They all showed a fall in BP and no side-effects were noted. From these results it is concluded that MK 421 is a strong and long-acting antihypertensive drug and its clinical application seems very useful for the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "48": "Captopril (2.0 microgram/ml) increased angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, kininase II) activity from 6- to 16-fold in culture medium of human endothelial cells from umbilical cord artery. Immunohistochemically detectable ACE was markedly increased in these cells when using rabbit antihuman lung ACE antiserum. This accords with either observations of increased ACE activity in serum and lungs from rats treated with captopril and shows induction of ACE biosynthesis in human vascular endothelial cells in culture. This observation offers a tool for studying the mechanism of ACE induction.", 
    "49": "Acute administration of the parasympathomimetic agent, bethanechol, at 2, 4, 8 and 12 mg/kg body wt, IP, induced drinking and increased urine output of rats in a dose-dependent fashion. The first significant increases in both water intake and urine output above that of controls occurred when 4 mg/kg was administered. The drinking and increased urine output in response to administration of 8 mg bethanechol/kg was inhibited by atropine sulfate (3 and 6 mg/kg, IP). In addition, the beta-adrenergic antagonist, propranolol (6 mg/kg, IP, administered 30 min prior to treatment with bethanechol), inhibited bethanechol (8 mg/kg, IP)-induced drinking. Urine output, however, was unaffected by propranolol. Further, the angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, inhibited significantly the drinking response, but not the increased urine output, accompanying administration of bethanechol (8 mg/kg). The effect of bethanechol and the beta-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol (25 micrograms/kg) separately and in combination, on water intake was also studied. Both compounds increased water intake but they exerted no interactive effect when administered simultaneously. Administration of bethanechol (8 mg/kg) to conscious rats was also accompanied by a significant reduction in both mean blood pressure and heart rate that reached minimal levels within 10 min after treatment. Both responses had returned to control level by one hr after treatment. These results suggest that bethanechol induces drinking in rats by way of the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "50": "Today two largely new approaches are available for the treatment of clinical hypertension. First, captopril, an orally active angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, makes possible chronic blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. This compound, given alone or in combination with a diuretic, normalizes the blood pressure of most hypertensive patients. Unfortunately, because captopril may induce serious adverse effects the use of this inhibitor must be restricted to patients with high blood pressure refractory to conventional antihypertensive drugs. Second, compounds such as verapamil and nifedipine are capable of producing a marked vasodilating effect by inhibiting the entry of calcium into the vascular smooth muscle cells. However, the role of calcium channel blockers in the treatment of hypertensive disease awaits more precise definition.", 
    "51": "The relationship of the vascular effect of captopril to angiotensin converting enzyme activity and prostaglandin-dependent mechanism was studied in rat isolated kidneys, perfused with Krebs-Henseleit at 20 ml/min per 2 kidneys, with basal perfusion pressures of 78 +/- 1 mm Hg (Mean +/- S.E.M.). Two doses of captopril were used; both low (0.05 microgram/ml) and high doses (5 microgram/ml) inhibited maximally the vasoconstrictor responses to 100 and 200 ng of angiotensin I. Captopril at the low dose did not affect the renal vasoconstrictor responses to norepinephrine (NE) (25-400 ng), whereas high-dose reduced the vasoconstriction to all doses of NE. Treatment with captopril tended to diminish dose-related release of prostaglandins in response to NE. Indomethacin (1 microgram/ml) prevented NE-induced release of bioassayable and radioimmunoassayable prostaglandins but did not affect the ability of captopril to reduce NE-induced vasoconstriction. High-dose captopril also decreased the vascular reactivity to angiotensin II (5 ng) and lysine vasopressin (10 mU); however, the renal vasoconstriction caused by PGE2 (80 ng) was unaffected by captopril. We conclude that high-dose captopril decreased vascular reactivity by a mechanism independent of converting enzyme inhibition and unrelated to a prostaglandin-dependent vascular mechanism.", 
    "52": "A Mg(2+)-dependent, alkaline phosphatase has been isolated from mature pollen of Lilium longiflorum Thunb., cv. Ace and partially purified. It hydrolyzes 1l- and 1d-myo-inositol 1-phosphate, myo-inositol 2-phosphate, and beta-glycerophosphate at rates decreasing in the order named. The affinity of the enzyme for 1l- and 1d-myo-inositol 1-phosphate is approximately 10-fold greater than its affinity for myo-inositol 2-phosphate. Little or no activity is found with phytate, d-glucose 6-phosphate, d-glucose 1-phosphate, d-fructose 1-phosphate, d-fructose 6-phosphate, d-mannose 6-phosphate, or p-nitrophenyl phosphate. 3-Phosphosphoglycerate is a weak competitive inhibitor. myo-Inositol does not inhibit the reaction. Optimal activity is obtained at pH 8.5 and requires the presence of Mg(2+). At 4 millimolar, Co(2+), Fe(2+) or Mn(2+) are less effective. Substantial inhibition is obtained with 0.25 molar Li(+). With beta-glycerophosphate as substrate the K(m) is 0.06 millimolar and the reaction remains linear at least 2 hours. In 0.1 molar Tris, beta-glycerophosphate yields equivalent amounts of glycerol and inorganic phosphate, evidence that transphosphorylation does not occur.In higher plants this myo-inositol-1-phosphatase links myo-inositol biosynthesis to the myo-inositol oxidation pathway to produce an alternative path from d-glucose 6-phosphate to UDP-d-glucuronate that bypasses UDP-d-glucose dehydrogenase. myo-Inositol-1-phosphatase also furnishes free myo-inositol for reactions that lead to other cyclitols and cyclitol-containing compounds of biosynthetic and/or regulatory significance in plant growth and development.", 
    "53": "Studies were performed to quantitate the effects of progressive increases in renal venous pressure (RVP) on renin secretion (RS) and renal hemodynamics. RVP was raised in 10 mmHg increments to 50 mmHg. Renin secretion rate increased modestly as RVP was increased to 30 mmHg and then increased sharply after RVP exceeded 30 mmHg. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal blood flow (RBF), and filtration fraction (FF) did not change significantly when RVP was elevated to 50 mmHg. GFR and RBF were also measured after the renin-angiotension system (RAS) was blocked with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI) SQ 14225. After a 60-min CEI infusion, RBF was elevated (32%), GFR was unchanged, FF was decreased, and total renal resistance (TRR) was decreased. As RVP was increased to 50 mmHg, GFR and FF decreased to 36.3 and 40.0% of control, respectively, RBF returned to a value not significantly different from control, and TRR decreased to 44.8% of control. The data indicate that the RAS plays an important role in preventing reductions in GFR during increased RVP because blockade of angiotensin II (ANG II) formation by the CEI results in marked decreases in GFR at high RVPs. The decreases in GFR after ANG II blockade and RVP elevation were not due to lack of renal vasodilation, since TRR was maintained below while RBF was maintained either above or at the pre-CEI levels.", 
    "54": "The effect of captopril on blood pressure and on the depressor responses to intravenously administered bradykinin was examined in anesthetized normotensive rats during inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. The hypotensive action of captopril persisted after treatment with indomethacin in doses that markedly suppressed urinary excretion of the prostacyclin metabolite 6-keto prostaglandin F1 alpha. Captopril markedly potentiated the vasodepressor responses to intravenous bradykinin given by bolus injection or continuous infusion. Neither the magnitude nor the duration of the blood pressure fall were affected by treatment with indomethacin. It is concluded that in the anesthetized rat the hypotensive action of captopril and its augmentation of the depressor response to bradykinin is independent of prostacyclin synthesis.", 
    "55": "The effects of captopril (C) in doses of up to 450 mg/day, placebo (P), and hydrochlorothiazide (H) in doses of 50 to 100 mg/day were compared in double-blind studies in 38 black patients. Mean blood pressure response to C was only slightly greater than to P (systolic response difference only). Mean blood pressure responses to H were greater than to C. Results were compared to available data on 185 white and black patients treated similarly. In white patients, response to C was greater than to P, but response to H was approximately equal to that to C. In black patients, results were of the same order as those reported here; the systolic response to C was greater than that to P and response to H was greater than that to C. These data suggest that black and white patients differ in response to certain antihypertensive drugs.", 
    "56": "We gave captopril, an angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitor, to four patients with unexplained pulmonary hypertension to see if it would lower pulmonary arterial pressure or pulmonary vascular resistance. The patients were studied at rest and during supine bicycle exercise, before and after 48 hours of captopril treatment (up to 450 mg/day). During the treatment, each patient was monitored, with systemic and pulmonary pressures measured hourly, and cardiac output every two to four hours. We found no significant effect of captopril, either at rest or with exercise, on the cardiac output, pulmonary artery pressure, or pulmonary vascular resistance, measured at the end of 48 hours treatment. We noted, however, that during the 48 hour period, all patients showed pronounced swings in their pulmonary and systemic artery pressures and cardiac outputs that had no relation to the administration of captopril or time of day. We conclude that captopril appears to be ineffective in causing a sustained reduction in the pulmonary artery pressure or pulmonary vascular resistance in patients with primary pulmonary hypertension. It appears, however, that these patients experience spontaneous variability in their pulmonary resistance from hour to hour which needs to be further studied before a reliable assessment of long-term drug treatment can be made.", 
    "57": "In order to help clarify the role of the renin-angiotensin system in the evolution of the post-hemorrhagic circulatory shock syndrome, captopril, a potent inhibitor of the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, was infused into a hemorrhagic shock model in the cat. The hemorrhage protocol had arterial blood withdrawn until a mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) of 40 mm Hg developed. Oligemia was maintained for a period of 2.5 hr, after which time, all remaining shed blood was reinfused and the cats observed for an additional 2 hr. Coincident with the large reduction in MABP, superior mesenteric artery flow (SMAF) was similarly reduced as recorded by a noncannulating electromagnetic flow probe fitted around the artery. Post-oligemic plasma activities of cathepsin D (CD) and alkaline phosphatase (AP) were elevated 11-fold and 3-fold respectively; intestinal morphological damage was graded at 2.8 +/- 0.6 on a 0-4 scale of increasing severity (control: 0.03 +/- 0.02). Captopril was administered at an initial priming dose of 0.5 mg/kg followed by a continuous infusion of 0.5 mg/kg/hr. Improved post-reinfusion maintenance of MABP and SMAF was noted. Plasma elevations in enzyme activity were more moderate: 8-fold for CD, 1.5-fold for AP. Intestinal morphologic damage was graded at 2.5 +/- 0.3. Blockade of angiotensin II formation by captopril thus demonstrated beneficial effects on post-oligemic hemodynamic status and on the degree of cellular enzyme release without significant improvement in intestinal morphology.", 
    "58": "To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of oral angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition with low-dose (average 30 mg/day) captopril in diuretic-resistant hypertension, its long-term cardiocirculatory action was determined by dye-dilution method and venous-occlusion forearm plethysmography in 11 uncontrolled patients taking a thiazide diuretic. Significant declines in mean blood pressure (average 12.4 +/- 1.4 percent) and systemic vascular resistance (28.7 +/- 3.2 percent) accompanied an increase in cardiac output (24.8 +/- 4.1 percent). Forearm vascular resistance (16.0 +/- 2.7 percent) decreased considerably, but the decrease in limb vascular resistance did not parallel the fall in systemic vascular resistance in magnitude (p less than 0.01), indicating that arteriolar dilatation occurred on a selective basis. Plasma renin activity increased after therapy as plasma aldosterone levels consistently fell, while plasma norepinephrine concentrations were not changed. There was a direct correlation between pretreatment plasma renin activity and the magnitude of the decline in systemic vascular resistance (p less than 0.05). These findings suggest that the inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme with captopril in diuretic-resistant hypertensive patients improves cardiocirculatory function through selective dilatation. The reordering of regional blood flow, which appears to result from release of angiotensin-mediated vasoconstriction as well as the suppression of aldosterone, may underlie the prolonged benefit observed in these patients. This oral vasodilator in very low dose appears to represent an effective adjunct for the treatment of hypertension refractory to diuretics.", 
    "59": "1. The effect on renal function in sheep of inhibiting converting enzyme with captopril was examined before and after 5 days ACTH administration. 2. Glomerular filtration rate, effective renal plasma flow, effective renal blood flow, mean arterial pressure and plasma sodium were all significantly increased by ACTH treatment and plasma potassium was decreased. Captopril (20 mg i.v.) had no effect on renal function or blood pressure before or after ACTH treatment, although urinary potassium excretion decreased following captopril on day 6 of ACTH treatment. 3. The increase in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow seen with ACTH treatment in sheep does not appear to be mediated by the reninangiotensin system.", 
    "60": "The response of the systemic circulation to acute inhibition of the converting enzyme with 25 mg of oral Captopril (Squibb) was studied in six normal sodium-replete male volunteers at rest and during exercise, together with its effects on exercise capacity for graded uninterrupted exercise. In recumbent subjects at rest Captopril did not affect arterial pressure or heart rate, and plasma renin activity rose 2.5-fold (P less than 0.05). In subjects in the sitting position, at rest and during exercise until exhaustion, Captopril reduced mean brachial intra-arterial pressure by an average of 7 Torr in comparison to placebo (P less than 0.001). Captopril's hypotensive effect was caused by a reduction of systemic vascular resistance (P less than 0.01), without changes of cardiac output (measured by CO2 rebreathing), heart rate, or stroke volume. Plasma renin activity was significantly higher during Captopril (P less than 0.001). Peak oxygen uptake and exercise duration were the same after administration of Captopril or placebo. The data demonstrate that the renin-angiotensin system is not involved in the homeostasis of blood pressure in supine sodium-replete humans, but has a modest role in blood pressure regulation when posture is changed from supine to upright. The orthostatic effect of Captopril is maintained during upright exercise. Furthermore the reduction of systemic vascular resistance by Captopril does not affect peak oxygen uptake.", 
    "61": "1 Two single doses of 10 mg each of the converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril maleate or MK-421 and of its lysine analogue (MK-521) were administered p.o. to twelve male volunteers. 2 The active diacid metabolite of MK-421 and the lysine analogue were determined by radioimmunoassay and MK-421 by the active metabolite method following in vitro hydrolysis. 3 Peak serum levels of MK-421, active metabolite and lysine analogue were reached within 1, 3 to 4, and 6 h respectively. Practically all MK-421 had disappeared from serum within 4 h. 4 A close correlation between percent inhibition of plasma converting enzyme activity and the serum concentration of active metabolite was observed ( r = 0.98, n = 171, P less than 0.001). Similarly, converting enzyme blockade as expressed by the ratio plasma angiotensin II/angiotensin I was closely correlated with serum active metabolite levels (r = 0.93, n = 15, P less than 0.001).", 
    "62": "1 The disposition of two angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitor drugs was studied in normal volunteers. One drug was enalapril maleate (MK-421), which requires in vivo esterolysis to yield active inhibitor (MK-422). The other was a lysine analogue of MK-422 (MK-521), which requires no bioactivation. 2 Absorption of enalapril maleate (10 mg, p.o.) was rapid, with peak serum concentrations of enalapril observed 0.5-1.5 h after administration. Based upon urinary recovery of total drug (enalapril plus MK-422), absorption was at least 61%. Bioactivation appeared to be largely post-absorptive. From the ratio of MK-422 to total drug in urine, the minimum extent of bioactivation was estimated at 0.7. 3 A similar dose of MK-521 was absorbed more slowly, reaching peak serum concentrations 6-8 h following drug administration. Minimum absorption, based upon urinary recovery, was 29%. 4 Serum concentration v time profiles for both drugs were polyphasic and exhibited prolonged terminal phases. 5 Recovery in urine and faeces of administered enalapril maleate (intact and as MK-422) was 94%. Recovery of MK-521 was 97%. These results indicate lack of significant metabolism of these agents, apart from the bioactivation of enalapril.", 
    "63": "Potassium is known to enhance the aldosterone-stimulating action of angiotensin II. Such a synergistic interaction of potassium with angiotensin II could represent an action by angiotensin II to potentiate potassium as a stimulus. To examine for this effect of angiotensin II on potassium, plasma aldosterone levels were measured before and after an infusion of potassium chloride (15 meq i.v.) into dogs without and with prevention of angiotensin II formation by captopril, an angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitor. In addition, responses to potassium were measured in a group of dogs receiving angiotensin II plus captopril. After potassium infusion, control dogs showed an increase of 7.7 +/- 1.9 (SEM) ng/dl (P less than 0.001) in the level of plasma aldosterone. In contrast, captopril-treated dogs showed no change in plasma aldosterone concentration in response to potassium. When angiotensin II was administered to captopril-treated dogs responsiveness to potassium administration was restored (plasma aldosterone concentration increased by 7.4 +/- 2.1 ng/dl, P less than 0.002). ACTH stimulated aldosterone secretion despite captopril treatment (P less than 0.001), however, ACTH produced a greater increase in the plasma aldosterone concentration in controls than in captopril-treated animals. It is evident from these results that stimulation of aldosterone secretion by potassium is considerably enhanced by angiotensin II. There appears to exist an important interdependence of these stimuli in the regulation of aldosterone secretion.", 
    "64": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in rat brain closely resembled that in lung in its kinetics with the substrate Hip-His Leu, the inhibitors SQ 20,881 and SQ 14,225, and iun its Cl- activation profile. Modification of dietary NaCl intake was associated with marked changes in brain ACE activity. Sodium-loaded rats had lower activity of ACE in hypothalamus, striatum, and midbrain, and higher activity in spinal cord compared to controls. In sodium-restricted rats, ACE was elevated in pituitary and depressed in spinal cord. Chronic intravenous infusion of angiotensin (AII) was associated with a pattern of changes partly resembling sodium loading: ACE was depressed in hypothalamus and striatum but elevated in midbrain. After chronic intracerebroventricular infusion of AII, ACE was elevated in striatum and hippocampus, and depressed in spinal cord; a pattern of changes quite different from those associated with intravenous AII. These results show that ACE in several brain regions is sensitive to dietary sodium intake and support the hypothesis that angiotensin-containing neurons in these areas might be responsive to NaCl status of the animal. The observed changes in brain ACE do not seem to be explained in any simple manner by changes in circulating or central angiotensin II.", 
    "65": "A 30 year old man with metastatic embryonal carcinoma became hypertensive during vinblastine, bleomycin, and cisplatin therapy. Three months after completion of therapy, accelerated hypertension occurred (blood pressure 210/140 mm Hg). Nitroprusside failed to control the hypertension, but captopril resulted in a prompt and sustained normalization of the blood pressure. The plasma renin activity was markedly elevated before therapy. Renal biopsy disclosed \"onionskin\" narrowing of the interlobular arteries and fibrin thrombosis of a majority of the afferent arterioles. A form of drug-induced renovascular hypertension is suggested.", 
    "66": "Injection of angiotensin II (AII) into the cerebral ventricles at doses as low as 1 pmol h-1 results in a marked stimulation of salt and water ingestion in the rat. Evidence that AII is produced in the central nervous system independently of the circulating renin-angiotensin system (RAS) raises the possibility that endogenous brain AII is involved in the physiological regulation of thirst. The role of brain AII in salt appetite is still unclear. Here we confirm that the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR), believed to have elevated levels of brain AII, possesses an exaggerated salt appetite compared with its normotensive controls. We also show that this exaggerated salt appetite is reduced by chronic central treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, while that of the normotensive controls is unaffected. Our study suggests that a central neuropeptide, probably AII, is involved in the maintenance of the exaggerated salt appetite in this model of hypertension.", 
    "67": "The treatment of congestive cardiomyopathy is dependent on clinical findings, reduced ejection fraction and presence of congestion. Diet, digitalis and vasodilator drugs: prazosin or dihydralazine are used in congestive cardiomyopathy class I or II (NYHA). In the presence of congestion diuretics are added, in chronic congestion of the lung nitrate. Congestive cardiomyopathy class III or IV (NYHA) is treated with diet, digitalis and the converting enzyme inhibitor captopril. In the therapy of HOCM or HNCM the calcium antagonist verapamil is now widely used and seems to be replacing the beta-blocker treatment with propranolol. If treatment with beta-blocker and calcium antagonists in patients with HOCM class III or IV (NYHA) ist ineffective surgical therapy is necessary.", 
    "68": "The acute and long-term (6 months) effects of captopril (C) were studied in 23 patients with previously uncontrolled severe (DBP greater than 120 mmHg) hypertension of different origin: essential (EH,) n=10, renovascular (RVH) n=9, and renal (RH) n=4. In addition, four patients were treated with renal transplant artery stenosis and hypertension (TRVH), refractory to conventional therapy. Before treatment supine blood pressure (BP, mmHg) averaged: 205/131 (EH), 204/124 (RVH), 207/132 (RH) and 194/117 (TRVH). All patients received diuretics and other antihypertensive drugs, the dosages of which are expressed in arbitrary equivalent units (U) per day (UD = diuretics; UA = other antihypertensive drugs). Antihypertensive therapy before study: UD:EH 1.6; RVH 1.0; UA: EH 7.3; RVH 5.5. After admission, C dosage was increased from 25 mg to a maximum of 150 mg t.i.d. Antihypertensive treatment was reduced as far as possible. DBP decrease after 25 mg C was related to pretreatment PRA in RVH only. After 3 months of C treatment, BP decreased to 190/116 in EH and 145/89 in RVH (EH vs RVH P less than 0.01), 158/98 in RH, and 154/90 in TRVH. After 6 months, BP response was maintained in RH and TRVH. BP increased slightly in RVH to 158/102 mmHg, mainly because of impaired renal function in three patients with bilateral renovascular disease. In EH,BP decreased to 167/109, since three non-responders were taken out of the group. After 6 months, EH still received higher dosages of antihypertensive drugs than RVH. Acute and chronic hypotensive effects of C were not significantly correlated. Side-effects occurred in five patients: skin rash and pruritus [2], taste disturbances [1], proteinuria [1], and acute renal failure in one patient with TRVH. In our hands, captopril in combination with diuretics was significantly more potent in severe RVH than in EH. Dosages and side-effects of other antihypertensive drugs could be markedly reduced in most patients, which may improve long-term drug compliance.", 
    "69": "Human neutrophil cathepsin G and human skin mast cell chymase rapidly convert angiotensin I to angiotensin II with only minor cleavage elsewhere in the molecule. The rate of cleavage is consistent with a potential role for either or both of these enzymes in an alternate pathway for angiotensin II synthesis. Since neither enzyme in inhibited by captopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inactivator, it is possible that leukocyte and mast cell enzymes may play a significant role in the development of abnormally high local concentrations of angiotensin II, associated with various inflammatory processes.", 
    "70": "Unilateral ureteral obstruction for 1, 2 and 3 week intervals in rats resulted in a significant loss of renal mass and function as measured 3 months following relief of the obstruction. Inhibition of angiotensin II production by the administration of captopril during the period of obstruction resulted in significant preservation of both renal mass and function. Inhibition of the prostaglandin-thromboxane system with the cyclooxygenase inhibitor. indomethacin, resulted in a lesser degree of preservation of renal function, but had no beneficial effect on renal mass. These experiments suggest that the renin-angiotensin and prostaglandin-thromboxane systems play a significant role in the loss of renal function from obstructive uropathy. Moreover, they demonstrate that renal function is better maintained if these hormonal systems are pharmacologically inhibited during obstruction.", 
    "71": "14C-Captopril was given intravenously to four normal subjects in a 4-mg priming dose followed by constant intravenous infusion of 1.7 mg/hr for 3.5 hr with and without concomitant probenecid. Steady-state levels of unchanged captopril were obtained between 1.5 and 3.5 hr. In the presence of probenecid, the average steady-state blood levels of total radioactivity were higher (36%) than on captopril alone. Unchanged captopril levels were slightly higher (14%) in the presence of probenecid. Kinetic evaluations were carried out exclusively on data for unchanged captopril. The average total body clearance (ClT) and renal clearance (ClR) of captopril in the absence of probenecid were 775 and 388 ml/kg/hr. The corresponding values for captopril with probenecid (631 and 217 ml/kg/hr) were lower. The average ratio of ClR to ClT for captopril alone was 0.50 and fell to 0.35 in the presence of probenecid. When captopril alone was given, a minimum of 78% of the renal excretion of captopril during steady-state could be attributed to net tubular secretion, but when captopril was given with probenecid, net tubular secretion was only 56%. The volume of distribution of captopril during steady state was not altered by probenecid. For the first 3.5 hr, cumulative renal excretion of total radioactivity with and without probenecid was 55% and 60%, but cumulative excretion of unchanged captopril was higher after captopril alone (36% of dose) than after the combination (21% of dose).", 
    "72": "Modified nonhydrolyzable tripeptide analogues of (S)-1-[5-(benzoylamino)-1,4-dioxo-6-phenylhexyl]-L-proline (1), designed to impart oral angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity, were made and evaluated in vivo and in vitro. The N-methyl and C5-methyl analogues of 1 were inactive. Insertion of heteroatoms (O, S, NH) into the C--C chain of 1 gave a series of compounds with high in vitro activity in the guinea pig serum ACE assay. The O-analogue was the most potent with an IC50 = 4.4 x 10(-9) M compared to 1 with an IC50 = 3.2 x 10(-9) M. The structure-activity relationships in this series of compounds lead one to speculate that the heteroatom provides an additional binding site to the surface of the enzyme; however, these compounds were inactive when tested for antihypertensive activity in the renal hypertensive rat at 30 mg/kg by the oral route (captopril is active at 1.0 mg/kg po).", 
    "73": "1 The influence of the renin-angiotensin system on plasma beta-endorphin-like immunoreactivity (beta-EI) was investigated in the conscious rat by use of a radioimmunoassay for beta-endorphin without prior extraction.2 Intravenous infusion of angiotensin I, II or (des-1-Asp)angiotensin II (angiotensin III) caused a dose-dependent increase in plasma beta-EI, angiotensin III infusion being less effective than angiotensin I or II. The plasma adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH) levels too were elevated by angiotensin II. The receptor antagonist, saralasin, prevented the angiotensin II-induced beta-EI release as did dexamethasone pretreatment.3 Both the release of beta-EI and the pressor response to angiotensin I were abolished by the converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril (SQ 14225). In contrast, captopril did not affect the action of angiotensin II.4 In view of the appreciable cross-reactivity of beta-lipotropin (beta-LPH) in our assay, plasma beta-EI was analysed by Sephadex G-50 chromatography. In plasma extracts of angiotensin II-infused rats, immunoreactivity corresponding to human beta-endorphin comprised about 49% of the total immunoreactivity, whereas 51% co-migrated with human beta-LPH.5 The increase in plasma levels of beta-EI elicited by angiotensin II was diminished by about 35% in rats with a hereditary absolute lack of vasopressin (Brattleboro rats), when compared to normal rats.6 These results suggest that the renin-angiotensin system can stimulate the secretion of beta-LPH and beta-endorphin with ACTH from rat anterior pituitary. One link in mediating the response appears to be vasopressin. The physiological function remains to be defined.", 
    "74": "The suppression of renin release by angiotensin II (AII) (the so-called short feedback loop) is blunted in essential hypertension. To determine whether this abnormality is reversible, renin release was assessed in sodium-restricted essential hypertensives and normal controls: (a) during the administration of captopril for varying intervals and (b) following the infusion of graded doses of AII (0.3-3 ng/kg per min) before and after plasma levels of AII had been chronically reduced with captopril (25-50 mg every 6 h) for 70 h. In control subjects, the maximal increment above control in plasma renin activity (PRA) after a single dose of captopril (11.9+/-3 ng/ml per h) was significantly (P < 0.02) greater than in hypertensives (8.1+/-1.7 ng/ml per h) despite similar reductions in AII levels and significantly greater decrements in diastolic blood pressure in the hypertensives. When captopril was continued for 70 h, the PRA increments above base line in hypertensive subjects (11.4+/-2.9 ng/ml per h) rose to levels seen in the controls (11+/-2.6 ng/ml per h); there were no significant differences in the AII or diastolic blood pressure decrements between the two groups. Compared with normotensive subjects, AII failed to suppress renin release in hypertensive subjects despite significantly greater diastolic blood increments and comparable AII levels achieved at each AII dose. After captopril treatment, AII now produced significant declines in PRA in the hypertensives; moreover, comparing declines pre- and postcaptopril, greater PRA decrements were seen either at comparable rises in levels of AII or diastolic blood pressure. Finally, the suppression of PRA by AII postcaptopril in hypertensives was now indistinguishable from that seen in normal controls. Thus, the impaired regulation of renin by AII is reversible with prolonged captopril treatment, suggesting that this abnormality is not due to a fixed structural defect but to a reversible lesion.", 
    "75": "AII occurs in the kidney at concentrations that greatly exceed those accounted for by trapped blood and is unaltered by prior perfusion of the kidneys to remove blood. Furthermore, kidney AII is unaltered by an infusion of AII at rates that double the plasma AII. The converting enzyme blocker SQ 20881 led to a fall in kidney AII and a rise in plasma renin activity (PRA). After dietary sodium deprivation, kidney AII, kidney renin, and PRA were all elevated. Sodium loading depressed plasma and kidney renin but did not alter intrarenal AII. In the two-kidney, one-clip renal hypertension model, kidney AII was elevated in the clipped kidney but unlike kidney renin was not suppressed in the contralateral kidney. Acute renal failure (ARF) induced by uranyl nitrate was associated with raised kidney AII and PRA, whereas no such changes occurred in glycerol-induced ARF. Replacement of volume losses in uranyl-nitrate-treated rats prevented the rise in PRA and the onset of ARF but not the rise in kidney AII. These findings are consistent with a local role of AII in the kidney.", 
    "76": "Previous studies have indicated the existence of an unknown AII-forming enzyme (AFE) in the glomerular region. This investigation was undertaken to characterize this enzyme further and to elucidate its possible physiologic role. AFE activity was found in cortical tissue and in microdissected superficial and juxtamedullary glomeruli but not in renal medulla. It could be blocked by the converting enzyme (CE) inhibitors SQ 20881 (133.5 micrograms/ml; 70%), SQ 14225 (20 ng/ml; 80%), and DFP (20 micrograms/ml; 80%). In contrast to AI CE, AFE was neither blocked by EDTA nor stimulated by sodium chloride. In a further study, AFE activity and AII immunoreactivity were measured simultaneously in different renal structures and in plasma under control conditions and following water deprivation. Highest AII immunoreactivity was demonstrated in microdissected glomeruli (about 10 ng/g; N = 11) and lower amounts in cortical tissue (2.83 +/- 0.72 ng/g; N = 12), avascular cortical tissue (1.80 +/- 1.08 ng/g; N = 3), outer medulla (1.52 +/- 0.33 ng/g; N = 12), inner medulla (0.72 +/- 0.17 ng/g; N = 2), and in plasma (0.212 +/- 0.066 ng/ml; N = 12). Water deprivation had no measurable effect on AFE activity; but AII immunoreactivity increased significantly in all samples. This indicates that, in spite of the extremely high juxtaglomerular renin activity, AFE cannot be regarded as the limiting enzyme for local AII formation under the conditions investigated.", 
    "77": "We have reviewed the development of Thurau's hypothesis that angiotensin mediates the effector responses of distal tubuloglomerular feedback-induced changes of nephron function. Several studies attempting to correlate responsiveness of the tubuloglomerular feedback system with intrarenal renin or juxtaglomerular renin contents have not delineated angiotensin's role in the feedback control system. Others and our own recent studies that have assessed the effects of acute blockade of the renin-angiotensin system on the responsiveness of tubuloglomerular feedback activity suggest that the effects of angiotensin are most likely a modulating influence on the activity of the system rather than the mediator of feedback-induced changes in glomerular function.", 
    "78": "The essentials of estimation of the number of enzyme active sites by reversible inhibition are discussed. The necessity of evaluation of the substrate effect on the equilibrium of the systems with a rapidly dissociating enzyme -- inhibitor complex has been demonstrated. Some procedures for determination of the number of active sites of dipeptidyl-carboxypeptidase (EC 3.4.15.1) from bovine kidney cortex, using the competitive inhibitor SQ 20 881 (Glu-Trp-Pro-Arg-Pro-Gln-Ile-Pro-Pro) have been developed. The kinetic and equilibrium constants for the enzyme-inhibitor interaction (ki = 3.2 . 10(6) M-1s-1, k-i = 8 ms-1 and Ki = 2.5 +/- 0.5 nm) have been calculated.", 
    "79": "Captopril and teprotide were administered intra-arterially to the kidney and intravenously to inhibit intrarenal and extrarenal converting enzyme (CE), respectively. Captopril was infused at 0.4, 0.8, and 1.6 micrograms . kg-1 . min-1 intra-arterially, and teprotide was given at 0.4 and 0.8 micrograms . kg-1 . min-1 intra-arterially in salt-replete dogs (group 1). Both agents were also given intravenously in the dose of 0.2 mg/kg, known to cause maximal extrarenal CE inhibition. The intra-arterial infusions of the inhibitors had no effect on renal hemodynamics but caused a graded degree of intrarenal CE inhibition. A lesser degree of extrarenal CE inhibition was seen after captopril in these doses. Intravenous administration of captopril and teprotide inhibited extrarenal CE, but only captopril increased renal blood flow (13%). When teprotide was given in a higher dose (group 3, 1.02 mg/kg), it too increased renal blood flow. In salt-deplete dogs (group 2), captopril infused intra-arterially caused a degree of intrarenal CE inhibition comparable with that in the salt-replete dogs but again produced little or no renal hemodynamic changes. When given intravenously in this group, captopril inhibited extrarenal EE and elicited a greater increase in renal blood flow (36%) than in the group 1 dogs. These results indicate that in conscious dogs renal vasodilatation is associated with extrarenal, but not intrarenal, CE inhibition.", 
    "80": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor was used in dogs with uranyl nitrate-induced acute renal failure to evaluate (1) a possible protective effect of angiotensin blockade and (2)the role of angiotensin II in the generation of renal failure in this model. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor treatment attenuated the fall in glomerular filtration rate and renal blood flow during the first 6 hours after injection of the nephrotoxic agent. A protective effect of similar magnitude was observed whether angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor treatment preceded, or shortly followed, the administration of uranyl nitrate. This indicates that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor delivery to its intrarenal site of action remains effective after administration of the nephrotoxin. In addition, protection of glomerular filtration rate correlated with sodium and renal solute excretion. However, combined treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and furosemide enhanced solute excretion but did not further improve the protection of renal function. Finally, the protective effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor on renal function and hemodynamics were abolished by intravenous indomethacin. In conclusion, early, continuous blockade of angiotensin II protects partially against th initiation of acute renal failure. These findings support a major pathogenic role for angiotensin II in the generation phase of acute renal failure in this model. Furthermore, they suggest that an imbalance between vasoconstrictive (angiotensin II) and vasodilating factors (prostaglandins) may be operative in the early phase of uranyl nitrate-induced acute renal failure in the dog.", 
    "81": "A prominent action of converting enzyme inhibitors, such as captopril, is a reduction in angiotensin II formation, but interpretation of responses has been complicated by the potential for such agents to reduce bradykinin degradation and promote prostaglandin release. To assess the specificity of the action of captopril, we pretreated rabbits with desoxycorticosterone and a high sodium intake, to suppress the renin-angiotensin system and thus maximize the renal vascular responses which might be unrelated to angiotensin II. Captopril was infused intravenously in graded dosage from 10 to 3,000 microgram/kg, and renal blood flow measured with an electromagnetic flowmeter. Despite suppression of the renin system, captopril increased renal blood flow from 3.7 +/- 0.5 to 5.3 +/- 0.8 ml/g/min (p less than .001) in 7 rabbits. In 6 additional rabbits, captopril was superimposed on a saralasin infusion (1.0 microgram/kg/min) in a dose sufficient to block response to endogenous angiotensin II. Saralasin prevented entirely the renal vasodilator response to captopril. Two surprising conclusions derive from this study: first, the renal vasodilator response to captopril appears to be specific for a reduction in angiotensin II formation; second, endogenous angiotensin appears to contribute to renal vascular tone, at least when anesthesia is employed, even when the renin system has been suppressed by a combination of a high sodium intake and desoxycorticosterone.", 
    "82": "Chronotropic responses to angiotensin I and angiotensin II, vasopressin and bradykinin were measured in guinea pig isolated right atria. Angiotensin II (100-30,000 pg/ml) was slightly more potent than angiotensin I and caused a maximum tachycardia of 30-40 b/min; only 20% of the maximum response to (--)-noradrenaline. Propranolol (1 micro M) or reserpine pretreatment (1 mg/kg i.p., 24 h) did not alter the response to angiotensin II or bradykinin. Converting enzyme inhibition by captopril (10 micrograms/ml) did not affect resting rate nor the response to angiotensin II but shifted the location of the angiotensin I curve by 40 fold to the right. Bradykinin (5-500 ng/ml) caused small increases in rate while vasopressin 1-100 ng/ml was completely without effect. These results suggest that angiotensin II has a small positive chronotropic effect that is not dependent on tissue noradrenaline release or beta-adrenoceptors and that tissue converting enzyme is active in right atria. Relatively high concentrations of angiotensin and bradykinin were required to directly stimulate the sino-atrial node compared with plasma levels measured during physiological stimuli. Therefore these effects on atria are probably of little physiological significance for peptide concentrations in plasma but may be important in relation to local tissue generation of angiotensin II.", 
    "83": "Angiotensin I (AI) and angiotensin II (AII) caused concentration-dependent increases in atrial rate in guinea pig isolated right atria. Converting enzyme inhibitors captopril and MK421-diacid did not alter the responses to AII but displaced the curves to AI to the right. The atrial response to generated AII from AI was used as a bioassay to estimate the dissociation constants of converting enzyme inhibitors (Kb) and test for kinetics of simple competition. MK421-diacid was 12-40 times more potent than captopril. However, estimations of Kb for captopril and MK421-diacid were unsatisfactory because at high concentrations of inhibitors the curves to AI were not displaced according to simple competition. We conclude that AI in high concentration can stimulate AII receptors accounting for the stationary displacement of curves to AI in the presence of converting enzyme inhibitors. MK421-diacid also potentiates responses to bradykinin in this assay.", 
    "84": "Captopril was administered to acute (8 to 14 days after unilateral renal artery constriction) and chronic (71 to 127 days after the constriction) two-kidney Goldblatt hypertensive dogs, and to normotensive ones for 21 days (oral administration of 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg/day, consecutively each 7-day period). The decrease of arterial blood pressure was remarkable in hypertensive animals with high plasma renin activity, but not in the normotensive animals. In the acute stage of hypertension, the antihypertensive effect of captopril was dose-dependent and persistent even after its cessation. In the chronic stage of hypertension, blood pressure also decreased, but the response was not dose-dependent and did not continue after cessation. Plasma renin activity rose in both hypertensive and normotensive animals during the treatment with captopril. There were no significant changes in heart rate, daily urinary volume, sodium balance, and renal clearances of sodium (CNa), potassium (CK), chloride (CCl) and creatinine (CCr). Circulating blood volume was also not altered. These results indicate that the main mechanism of antihypertensive effect of captopril in two-kidney Goldblatt hypertensive dogs is an inhibition of the angiotensin converting enzyme. In addition, the different effects in the acute and chronic hypertensive dogs suggest that some differences exist in the mechanism(s) of maintaining blood pressure between the two stages of two-kidney Goldblatt hypertension in dogs.", 
    "85": "The role of the renin-angiotensin system in the regulation of the blood pressure of dexamethasone-treated rats (Dex) was evaluated using saralasin, an angiotensin II antagonist, and SQ 14225 (SQ) (d-3-mercapto-2-methylpropranoyl-1-proline), an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. During a 7-day period blood pressure rose 65 +/- 10 mmHg (P less than 0.001) in Dex with no significant changes in plasma renin activity. Concurrent administration of dexamethasone and SQ attenuated the elevation of blood pressure (P less than 0.05). In the conscious, freely moving state, intravenous injection of SQ (10, 30, 100 micrograms/kg) reduced blood pressure of DEX in a dose-dependent manner (P less than 0.05). Also, intravenous injection of saralasin (10 micrograms.kg-1 . min-1) reduced blood pressure significantly (P less than 0.01). Bilateral nephrectomy abolished the effects of saralasin and SQ on blood pressure in Dex. These results indicate that the elevation of blood pressure in DEX depends partially on the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "86": "To clarify the independent roles of prostaglandins and the renin-angiotensin system in the pressor resistance to angiotensin II in Bartter's syndrome, the pressor responsiveness to exogenous angiotensin II was investigated in three patients with the syndrome during the administration of indomethacin synthesis, and captopril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. All the patients showed high plasma renin activity, increased urinary excretion of prostaglandin E, and pressor resistance of angiotensin II. An analogue of angiotensin II that had weak agonistic properties induced a marked fall in blood pressure. Pretreatment with indomethacin (150 mg/day) decreased baseline plasma renin activity and reversed the hypotensive effect of the analogue of angiotensin II. Apparently, our data support the concept that pressor resistance ultimately results from the increase in the concentration of endogenous angiotensin II. However, the augmentation of indomethacin was significantly (p less than 0.01) greater in magnitude than the response obtained with captopril, although the concentration of plasma angiotensin II prior to each infusion of angiotensin II was the same. This observation could be explained by the finding that indomethacin suppressed both systems, but captopril inhibited only the renin-angiotensin system. Evidence presented herein suggests that the abnormalities in the vascular reactivity to angiotensin II may result from, not only the decreased number of receptor sites as a results of the increased concentration of endogenous angiotensin II, but also from the alteration of the end-organ sensitivity to angiotensin II via overproduction of prostaglandins.", 
    "87": "We assessed the hemodynamic and hormonal response to tilt and the baroreceptor response in 12 patients in sinus rhythm with severe chronic congestive heart failure. We also assessed the response to acute (n = 12) and chronic (n = 8) converting-enzyme inhibition with captopril. The control tilt was characterized by high cardiac filling pressures, absence of significant peripheral pooling and apparent absence of afferent stimuli for hemodynamic and hormonal response. After acute captopril, the hemodynamic response to tilt was improved, but not normalized. The chronic response was characterized by the absence of a reflex increase of systemic vascular resistance on tilt despite peripheral pooling. Five patients developed orthostatic hypotension, but responded to acute infusion of 0.9% sodium chloride. Efferent sympathetic activity (response to cold pressor) was abnormal during the control study, but indistinguishable from normal subjects by the time of chronic captopril therapy. This paralleled an improved responsiveness of plasma catecholamines during chronic tilt. The Valsalva maneuver remained abnormal. There was a distinct absence of the normally anticipated heart rate increase on tilt, suggesting a parasympathetic abnormality.", 
    "88": "Alpha methyldopa has been shown to modify left ventricular mass and normalize mitochondria/myofibrils volume ratio in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) when administered during the stage of developing cardiac hypertrophy (Tomanek et al., Cardiovas Res 23: 173, 1979). To evaluate the long-term effects of this antihypertensive agent, the drug was administered to SHR and normotensive (WKY) rats between the ages of 1 and 12 months. In another group of SHR and WKY, treatment was delayed until the age of 12 months and the animals were then treated for 3 months. Treatment with alpha-methyldopa had similar effects on systolic blood pressures in both SHR groups; group means (+/- SEM) were 151 +/- 1 in the long-term treatment group and 157 +/- 5 in the delayed treatment group compared to 178 +/- 4 and 176 +/- 3 for their respective controls. While left ventricular weight and cell size were significantly lower after early long-term treatment (compared to nontreated SHR), delayed treatment had no significant effect on these indices of left ventricular mass. Despite the effectiveness of early long-term treatment in modifying left ventricular mass, the relative volumes of mitochondria and myofibrils, as well as other cellular components (sarcoplasm), were not altered. In contrast, delayed treatment caused a significant increase (approximately twofold) in relative sarcoplasmic volume and a decrease in relative myofibrillar volume in both SHR and WKY. These findings indicate that shifts in the relative volumes of intracellular components after alpha-methyldopa are independent of cell size and blood pressure. Furthermore, the data suggest that the effects of alpha-methyldopa on the myocardial cell are dependent on or influenced by factors associated with the development or stabilization of hypertrophy and/or age.", 
    "89": "Relationships among systolic blood pressure (SBP), plasma renin activity (PRA), arterial renin concentrations (ARC), and venous renin concentrations (VRC) were examined in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats before and after treatment with captopril. The ARC was elevated in SHR relative to WKY whereas VRC was not. Similarly, ARC was related to SBP (r = 0.69, p less than 0.01) whereas PRA was not (r = 0.04). Captopril (100 mg/kg daily by mouth for 8 days) decreased blood pressure significantly in both SHR and WKY. PRA as well as ARC and VRC were all increased by captopril. Bilateral nephrectomy virtually eliminated PRA but ARC was not significantly reduced over a 24-hour period. Bilateral nephrectomy also markedly attenuated the acute antihypertensive effects of captopril in SHR; however, a modest effect was still apparent. It is suggested that ARC in SHR, being higher than in WKY, may play a role in the genesis or maintenance of hypertension in this model. Furthermore, the effects of captopril in both intact and nephrectomized SHR may be related to the ability of captopril to inhibit the vascular formation of angiotensin II. Finally, vascular renin is probably not renal in origin and responds to typical feedback inhibition as unmasked by captopril administration.", 
    "90": "A 50-year-old man with hypertension showed hypokalemia, hyporesponsive low reninemia, and low levels of aldosterone in the plasma and urine. Plasma DOC and corticosterone level, adrenal scintigram, and phlebogram were within normal limits. Hypertension and hypokalemia were correctable by spironolactone. It was revealed that he had been ingesting Jintan granules in large doses, corresponding to 150-220 mg of glycyrrhizic acid per day for 10 years. Upon cessation of Jintan ingestion, blood pressure and serum potassium level were normalized after 40 days. Metabolic alkalosis, hypervolemia, hyporesponsive low reninemia, and the low levels of plasma and urine aldosterone were also improved. Thus, the present case of pseudoaldosteronism was attributed to Jintan, and raises a caution to excessive Jintan ingestion.", 
    "91": "In order to evaluate the roles of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and of catecholamines in 117 normotensive patients with chronic congestive heart failure (CHF), a study was made of the relationships between plasma concentrations, hepatic extraction of these humoral factors and hemodynamic parameters. In 6 patients with moderate to severe CHF, the acute effect of oral; administration of angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor, SQ 14225 (captopril), on mean arterial pressure (MAP), peripheral venous pressure (VP) and these humoral factors was investigated. In patients with CHF of Class III-IV (according to NYHA classification), the urinary norepinephrine (U-NE) excretion increased. Plasma norepinephrine (P-NE) levels increased in proportion to the severity of CHF (p less than 0.001) and had a positive correlation with systemic vascular resistance (SVR) (p less than 0.01), VP (p less than 0.05), pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PWP) (p less than 0.01) and plasma renin activity (PRA) (p less than 0.01). P-NE correlated negatively with the cardiac index (p less than 0.02). Hepatic extraction of norepinephrine (EX-NE) was reduced in patients with elevated right atrial pressure (RAP) (p less than 0.05) and negatively correlated with VP (p less than 0.05). In patients with elevated P-NE, U-NE increased significantly (p less than 0.01), despite their decreased renal clearance of norepinephrine (CNE) (p less than 0.02). There was no significant difference in EX-NE between these patients and patients with normal P-NE. PRA was higher in Class III-IV patients than in Class I-II patients in the prediuretic period (p less than 0.01). PA showed a significant positive correlation with PRA (p less than 0.001). Hepatic extraction of aldosterone (EX-A) was reduced in patients with elevated RAP (p less than 0.05) and was negatively correlated with VP (p less than 0.05). Following captopril administration, PRA increased consistently and PA decreased. MAP fell, especially in 2 patients with mitral stenosis. The heart rate tended to decrease. VP also fell with symptomatic improvement. The decline in VP was correlated with the decrease in P-NE (p less than 0.01). These findings suggest that the sympathetic nervous system contributes to the elevation of SVR and PWP even before frank heart failure develops. The rise of P-NE seems to be due to increased norepinephrine release from sympathetic nerve beds, whereas a decrease in hepatic extraction and renal clearance probably has only a minor effect. The renin-angiotensin system also seems to contribute to elevation of SVR, to maintain effective arterial pressure by enhanced sympathetic activity, and the renin-angiotensin system seems to be a main determinant of PA in CHF.", 
    "92": "Systematic blood coagulation analyses were conducted in 32 severely hypertensive patients treated with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril. Two hours after the first captopril dose, fibrin monomer complexes had already increased. This rise was even more distinct after 26 h and 1 week. Tests after 6 and 12 months of therapy showed a regression of fibrin monomer complexes to pretreatment values. In several patients with a marked increase in fibrin monomer complexes, the partial thromboplastin time (PTT) became shorter and antiplasmin activity increased. The most pronounced increase in fibrin monomer complexes was seen in patients with a rapid and excessive blood pressure reduction. The concentration of fibrin monomer complexes also rose in 15 healthy normotensive subjects, after a single oral dose of captopril (25 mg). Additionally, the PTT was shortened and antiplasmin significantly rose. An inhibition of fibrinolysis by captopril could be demonstrated by the effect on fibrin plates and thrombus weight after streptokinase. Out of 58 patients with severe hypertension and atherosclerosis treated with captopril, 7 patients suffered vascular complications during antihypertensive therapy: myocardial infarction (n = 2), coronary insufficiency (1), cerebral ischemia (1), renal insufficiency (3). These ischemic lesions may be partly explained by the alterations of coagulation and fibrinolysis under captopril therapy.", 
    "93": "The response of arterial blood pressure, plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma (PA) or urinary aldosterone (UA) concentrations to the administration of captopril, was studied in patients with established essential hypertension. Captopril was effective in lowering significantly the blood pressure (189.4/111.2 +/- 23.9/9.7 to 163.4/98.1 +/- 20.7/8.6 mmHg. mean +/- SD, p less than 0.01/0.001). Normal arterial blood pressure values (140.4/86.5 +/- 20.7/10.8 mmHg, were achieved by the addition of hydrochlorothiazide. Captopril administration was followed by a decrease in PA and in UA and an increase in PRA, suggesting the inhibition of angiotensin II formation. Captopril attenuated hypokalemia and hyperaldosteronism produced by the simultaneous administration of hydrochlorothiazide.", 
    "94": "We measured the activity of angiotensin converting enzyme (ED 3.4.15.1) in urine samples from normal subjects and patients with nephrotic syndrome and chronic glomerulonephritis. Urinary excretion of angiotensin converting enzyme in patients with nephrotic syndrome (1.58 +/- 0.50 (SD) units/day; n = 15) and chronic glomerulonephritis (1.01 +/- 0.45 units/day; n = 12) was significantly increased compared with normal subjects (0.38 +/- 0.10 units/day; n = 18). It was demonstrated that a high molecular weight form of the enzyme (more than 400000) was mainly excreted in urines from patients with nephrotic syndrome. After trypsin treatment, this form was altered to a low molecular weight form (290000). These two different forms of urinary angiotensin converting enzyme were compared with the enzyme purified from human kidney, and found to be identical with respect to Km values (2 mmol/l), pH optimum (pH 8.3), chloride ion dependency (0.8 mol/l), inhibitory effect of captopril (I50, 21 nmol/l), and behavior towards antiserum to human kidney angiotensin converting enzyme.", 
    "95": "Eight patients with essential hypertension completed a double-blind, randomly allocated crossover comparison of either 5 or 10 mg enalapril maleate, 50 mg hydrochlorothiazide, or their combination administered once daily during sequential two-week periods. Blood pressure, pulse rate, plasma renin activity, angiotensin-converting enzyme activity, plasma aldosterone concentration, and urinary electrolytes were monitored for 24 hours after placebo and on days 1 and 14 of each treatment period. After two weeks of each treatment, only the combination of enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide significantly lowered the mean seated diastolic blood pressure (SDBP). Likewise, SDBP control (less than or equal to 90 mm Hg) was achieved only after combination therapy; six of the eight patients were controlled by the combination for up to 24 hours. The initial SDBP response to combination therapy differed with the sequence of drug addition; however, by day 14 the responses were comparable, regardless of whether hydrochlorothiazide or enalapril was first given. Mean converting enzyme activity was suppressed by enalapril in all patients, though it did not always correlate with changes in SDBP or plasma aldosterone. Mean plasma renin activity increased, but the increase was significant only on the combination. There were no serious adverse effects.", 
    "96": "The new angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril maleate was given in single oral doses of 2.5, 5, and 10 mg to 11 hospitalized patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension who were on a 150-mEq sodium diet. All doses of enalapril induced reduction of mean seated diastolic blood pressure (SDBP). The magnitude of the initial SDBP reduction was not dose related, but the duration of effect was longer (greater than 12 hr) after the 5 and 10 mg. After dosing, mean plasma angiotensin converting enzyme activity (ACE) and aldosterone concentration (PAC) fell, while plasma renin activity (PRA) rose. Serum concentrations of the active diacid from of enalapril increased linearly with dosage; ACE was inhibited maximally at concentrations above 10 ng/ml. During repeated dosing in the outpatient trial there was attenuation of the antihypertensive effect (12 to 24 hr after dosing) in eight of 10 patients. Despite dose increases only two patients achieved SDBP control (less than or equal to 90 mm Hg). In the five patients in whom 50 mg/day hydrochlorothiazide was added near the end of the trail mean SDBP was further reduced. Enalapril was well tolerated. Further studies of the drug, especially in combination with diuretic, are needed.", 
    "97": "The hemodynamic responses to isometric exercise (hand grip) were investigated in normotensive subjects during a 150 mEq (n = 8) sodium diet and a 10 mEq (n = 6) sodium diet both before and after the administration of the converting enzyme inhibitor teprotide. Although teprotide significantly decreased the mean arterial pressure during both sodium intakes, the normal pattern of hemodynamic response to hand grip was preserved, that is mean arterial pressure was increased by hand grip mainly because of an increase in cardiac output. Changes of plasma catecholamines during hand grip were not affected by teprotide. In addition, the hemodynamic responses to standing were not substantially altered by teprotide. When fainting occurred (in the seated position) following the administration of teprotide, it was associated not only with a decrease in arterial pressure but also with a concurrent reduction in cardiac output. We conclude that angiotensin inhibition by teprotide does not significantly impair sympathetically mediated cardiovascular responses.", 
    "98": "Patients with pulmonary dysfunction and CO2 retention have renal hemodynamic abnormalities accompanied by increased plasma renin activity. To determine if hypercapnia impairs renal function, particularly through the renin-angiotensin system, the effects of acute hypercapnic acidosis (HC), using 8.5% CO2, were measured in five unanesthetized dogs during (a) the intact state; (b) renin-angiotensin antagonism using either 1-sarcosine, 8-glycine angiotensin II ( [Sar1, Gly8] AII) or SQ 14,225; and (c) exogenous angiotensin II infusion. As partial arterial carbon dioxide pressure (PaCO2) increased (p less than 0.05) from control (C) of 35 +/- 1 (SEM) to 48 +/- 1 mm Hg during HC, arterial pH fell (p less than 0.05) from 7.36 +/- 0.01 to 7.24 +/- 0.005. Renal function was uncompromised with HC, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and urinary sodium excretion increased (p less than 0.05) despite a fourfold rise in plasma renin activity from C of 0.6 +/- 0.3 to 2.2 +/- 0.8 ng AI ml-1 h-1 during HC. Administration of [Sar1, Gly8] AII during HC did not consistently alter systemic or renal hemodynamic responses, and effects of SQ 14,225 during HC were also observed during normocapnia. Although systemic vascular responses to exogenous AII infusion were similar, the renal vasoconstrictor response was antagonized during HC with unchanged GFR and renal blood flow. These findings indicate that despite activation of the renin-angiotensin system, acute hypercapnic acidosis is unassociated with impairment of renal function in unanesthetized dogs. This may be related to diminished renal vascular AII responsiveness during hypercapnia.", 
    "99": "We tested the hypothesis that cerebral arteriospasm developing after rupture of a subarachnoid aneurysm may be due to the vasoconstrictor effect of locally generated angiotensin II. Ten dogs had subarachnoid hemorrhage simulated by intracisternal introduction of 2 ml autologous blood, and were followed by cineangiography. Thirty minutes later, when acute arteriospasm was established, seven dogs received injection of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor teprotide and 3 control dogs received normal saline. Repeat angiography at 30 and 90 minutes after injection, showed total or partial release of spasm in the experimental dogs and no change or further intensification of spasm in the control animals. We concluded that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition may be a potentially useful approach for the reversal or prevention of cerebral arteriospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage.", 
    "100": "The present experiment was designed to clarify the contribution of the renin-angiotensin system to the acute depressor action of angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor and also to assess the role of the kidney under such conditions. In anesthetized dogs, intrarenal and i.v. infusion of SQ 14,225 at a rate of 0.5 mg/min resulted in a significant and similar fall in systemic blood pressure. This effect was not altered even when the receptors were occupied by exogenous angiotensin II (100 ng/min i.v.) This would suggest that the renin-angiotensin system plays a relatively minor role in the blood pressure reduction in normotensive anesthetized dogs. Six hours after nephrectomy when the plasma renin activity had become negligible, SQ 14, 225 produced a significant fall in systemic blood pressure. The magnitude was not statistically different from that noted during i.v. infusion of SQ 14,225 in the dog with both kidneys intact. The effect was abolished after inhibition of kallikrein, as induced by aprotinin (10,000 kallikrein inhibitory unit/kg i.v., 10,000 kallikrein inhibitory unit/kg.hr i.v.). In light of these findings, the possibility that the extrarenal kallikreinkinin system contributes to the acute hypotensive action of SQ 14,225 rather than to the inhibition of the metabolism of angiotensin has to be given attention.", 
    "101": "Exposure of rats to air at 5 C for 1-12 days is accompanied by a relative dehydration in spite of the continued presence of water. Dehydration during exposure to cold was manifested by: 1) a reduction in the ratio of water/food ingested; 2) an increase in the ratio of urine excreted/water ingested; 3) an increased evaporative water loss; 4) an increased serum osmolality and chloride concentration; and 5) a striking thirst and ingestion of water after transfer from cold to air at 26 C. Drinking began within 15 min and lasted approximately 1 h. Thermogenic drinking persisted for at least 120 days of exposure to cold. It was not thwarted by preventing access to water for either 1 or 2 h after transfer to warm air, but either intragastric or intraperitoneal administration of a water load equal to 3% of body weight inhibited water intake after transfer. These characteristics of thermogenic drinking are similar to those observed after 24 h of dehydration at 26 C; they also suggest that the cold-exposed rat is dehydrated relative to controls. These results suggest that osmoreceptors may play a role in the induction of thermogenic drinking. However, angiotensin II receptors may also play a role. Thermogenic drinking was inhibited by a beta 2-adrenergic, but not a beta 1-adrenergic, antagonist as well as by captopril, an inhibitor of the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Further, plasma renin activity increased fourfold within 15 min after removal from cold. This suggests that an additional component involved in thermogenic drinking is the angiotensin II receptor. The extent to which thermogenic drinking is mediated by each pathway is unknown and will require additional studies.", 
    "102": "1 The ability of captopril, 150 mg three times daily by mouth, to effect sustained reduction in plasma angiotensin II, with converse increases in circulating angiotensin I, and in active, inactive and total renin concentrations, has been assessed. 2 During prolonged treatment with captopril alone, and 12 h after the last dose of the drug, plasma angiotensin II remained approximately one-sixth of basal concentrations, while angiotensin I and renin concentrations were proportionately increased. However, further increases in angiotensin I, and in active, inactive and total renin concentrations, were seen 2 and 6 h after the morning dose of 150 mg captopril. 3 Inter-dose variations in plasma aldosterone and blood pressure were not closely related to concurrent variations in the renin-angiotensin system. 4 Arguments are presented for relying on measurements of plasma renin and angiotensin concentrations rather than of renin activity or aldosterone in assessing the effectiveness of converting enzyme inhibition.", 
    "103": "An analysis is presented of volume and vasoconstrictor factors in experimental renovascular hypertension. Volume expansion and increased cardiac output produced by renal retention of salt and water are not essential for chronic renovascular hypertension to develop. When volume expansion and increased cardiac output do occur, however, it appears that the increased cardiac output contributes directly to the hypertensive process without triggering myogenic alterations in peripheral resistance predicted by the whole-body autoregulation theory of hypertension. Activation of the renin-angiotensin vasoconstrictor mechanism is not essential for either the development or the maintenance of chronic one-kidney renovascular hypertension in either the dog or the rat. In experimental two-kidney renovascular hypertension, a clear species difference is apparent. In the two-kidney hypertensive dog, the angiotensin pressor mechanism appears to play only a transient role lasting about 1 wk. In the two-kidney Goldblatt hypertensive rat, however, both the development and the maintenance of the hypertension are angiotensin-dependent, at least for a 4- to 6-wk period. When both the volume component and the renin-angiotensin vasoconstrictor component were deleted in one-kidney rats by sodium depletion and chronic SQ 14225 administration, renal artery stenosis failed to produce chronic renovascular hypertension. It is concluded that the pathogenesis of chronic renovascular hypertension requires either volume expansion produced by renal salt and fluid retention or expression of the renin-angiotensin vasoconstrictor mechanism.", 
    "104": "1. The acute haemodynamic and hormonal effects of 100 mg of captopril (SQ 14.225) orally were tested in twelve healthy men in the sodium replete state before and after indomethacin pretreatment. 2. Without indomethacin, mean arterial blood pressure was reduced at 30 and 60 min after captopril (P less than 0.02). Heart rate did not change during the whole experiment. Although plasma renin activity (PRA) increased (P less than 0.002), plasma and urinary aldosterone and plasma 18-hydroxycorticosterone (18-OH-B) decreased after captopril (P less than 0.02). Prostaglandin (PG) E2, sodium and potassium excretion rates remained constant after captopril. 3. Under indomethacin pretreatment, the fall in mean arterial blood pressure was less than without indomethacin at 30 and 60 min after captopril (P less than 0.05). Heart rate was constantly lower than without indomethacin during the whole experiment (P less than 0.05). Indomethacin pretreatment decreased basal PGE2 excretion (P less than 0.02) and baseline PRA as well as the increase in PRA after captopril (P less than 0.05). Control mineralocorticoid levels were significantly lower than without indomethacin. In indomethacin-pretreated subjects, aldosterone did not further decrease after captopril, and 18-OH-B fell only slightly. 4. Without indomethacin pretreatment a significant, positive correlation was found between PRA values before captopril and the maximum decrease of mean arterial blood pressure after captopril. Under indomethacin pretreatment this correlation was no longer demonstrable. The results suggest that prostaglandins may contribute to the haemodynamic and hormonal actions of captopril.", 
    "105": "The effect of captopril on blood pressure and renal hemodynamics in relation to plasma renin activity (PRA) was assessed together with the vasodilator responses to brachial artery infusions of bradykinin (BK) and sodium nitroprusside (NP) before and after 4 wk of therapy with doses of up to 450 mg/day in patients with essential hypertension. The average blood pressure reduction of captopril was from 174.4/110.6 to 155.3/96.6 mm Hg (n = 12, P less than 0.001) without increases in heart rate or body weight. It was effective in the eight patients with normal renin, but showed little effect in the four with a low renin. There was a correlation between the changes in blood pressure after captopril and the pretreatment PRA (r = -0.82, P less than 0.01 for mean pressure). Brachial artery infusions of BK and NP induced dose-dependent rises in forearm blood flow (FBF), but this was not related to the captopril blood pressure-lowering effect. Repeat measurements during captopril therapy showed a shift to the left of the BK/FBF, but not of the NP/FBF, dose-response curve, indicating effective vascular kininase II inhibition. Captopril decreased renal vascular resistance. Our data are compatible with the view that captopril's antihypertensive action mainly involves blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and not cumulation of BK. The favorable effects on renal hemodynamics and the lack of tachycardia and volume retention after captopril make it a valuable drug for the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "106": "MK 421, 25 mg/kg, administered daily by gavage to young spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) from their 4th to 15th weeks of age almost completely inhibited genetic hypertension development. Since heart rate and cardiac index were not drug affected, prevention of genetic hypertension development was solely related to an early, potent and long-lasting limitation of the progressive increase in peripheral resistance which normally develops in SHRs during ageing. MK 421 slightly enhanced vascular responsiveness to exogenous norepinephrine and angiotensin II and reduced myocardial hypertrophy. Plasma renin concentration was increased. MK 421 slightly reduced body growth but did not affect fluid intake, urinary volume and urinary ADH, demonstrating that no water or salt retention developed. Finally, MK 421's preventive effects against genetic hypertension development persisted up to 10 weeks after treatment discontinuation.", 
    "107": "The effects of converting enzyme inhibition on plasma renin substrate concentration were studied in man and rat. This study use new direct radioimmunoassays of angiotensinogen completing the classical enzymatic methods. In human investigation converting enzyme is inhibited after Captopril treatment. Our results demonstrated that resulting increase of plasma renin concentration enhanced the consumption of renin substrate as shown by the fall of angiotensinogen levels measured by indirect method. In the rat, we observed the same drop of renin substrate during MK421 administration. The fall of angiotensinogen levels, measured by indirect method, was not in agreement with results of direct radioimmunoassay. This discrepancy can be explained by the accumulation of des-angiotensin I-angiotensinogen in plasma. These modifications are potentiated by sodium depletion.", 
    "108": "The effect of low doses (25 mg three times a day) of captopril was evaluated in 16 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension, previously uncontrolled by hydrochlorothiazide. After a no-treatment period, mean eight-hour seated diastolic blood pressure (SDBP, mm Hg) was 103 +/- 5 on placebo, 95 +/- 8 after a single dose of captopril, 96 +/- 4 after two weeks of captopril alone, and 90 +/- 6 after its combination with hydrochlorothiazide. Though nine patients had at least a 10% fall in SDBP after the initial dose of captopril, only three had a comparable fall after two weeks; after captopril and hydrochlorothiazide, however, 12 patients had such a response. Captopril decreased mean angiotensin-converting enzyme activity and plasma aldosterone, though to a lesser extent with continued therapy. Because its side effects appear dose related, low doses of captopril combined with a diuretic are effective and may be better tolerated.", 
    "109": "The chemical properties of skin angiotensin-converting enzyme were characterized in mouse and human. In newborn mice, dermis contained almost all activity (1.3 mU/mg), of which 30% was in the 22,000 kappa g supernatant and 70% in the pellet which could be solubilized by Triton X-100. The activity increased sharply during the first 6 weeks after the birth. By gel filtration, the enzyme in the supernatant was Mr 330,000, but the solubilized enzyme was Mr 430,000 in the presence of Triton X-100. By electrophoresis, the 2 enzyme fractions demonstrated a charge difference. The enzymes showed the same pH optima of around 8.1 and 7.7, and Km values of 2.6 and 0.11 mm for Hip-His-Leu and angiotensin I, respectively. Sensitivity to known inhibitors and heat stability of the enzymes in 2 fractions were similar. In the human, 56% of the activity in skin homogenates (1.5 mU/mg) appeared in this supernatant and 44% in the pellet. Both soluble and solubilized preparations showed enzyme activity with 2 different molecular weights, 330,000 and 430,000. The human enzymes had chemical properties similar to the mouse enzymes, but their affinity for Hip-His-Leu and angiotensin I were 1.6 and 2 times higher than those of the mouse enzymes.", 
    "110": "Systemic treatment of rats with captopril (50 mg/kg body wt per os), a specific competitive inhibitor of angiotensin l-converting enzyme, significantly inhibits vascular permeability changes induced by the intradermal injection of the vasoactive mediators histamine, bradykinin, serotonin, and compound 48/80. This effect of captopril is both dose- and time-dependent with approximately 60% inhibition of edema formation observed 7 h after captopril treatment (100 mg/kg body wt per os). The inhibitory effect of captopril on edema formation is temporally unrelated to the inhibition of serum angiotensin l-converting enzyme activity or serum prostaglandin E2 levels and is not inhibited by systemic treatment of rats with indomethacin. The data suggest that captopril may have potent antiinflammatory activity through as yet undefined mechanisms.", 
    "111": "Escape from the sodium-retaining action of mineralocorticoids coincides with the suppression of plasma renin and angiotensin II levels. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether blockade of the renin system accelerates this escape. Eight male normotensive volunteers, aged 24--33 yr, were maintained during two subsequent periods of 12 days each, separated by 3--4 weeks, on a constant intake of sodium and potassium of 140 mmol/day. During both periods, fludrocortisone acetate (0.2 mg) was administered orally three times a day on days 4--12. In addition, on days 3--12, either a converting enzyme inhibitor (MK 421;20 mg orally, twice daily) or a placebo was added in double blind fashion and randomized sequence. During both periods, blood pressures were similar; they tended to increase slightly toward day 12. The weight increase did not differ between the two periods. With MK 421, angiotension II levels were significantly lower than with placebo on days 3--6 (P less than 0.001). On the same days, PRA was increased due to converting enzyme blockade. Despite the significantly different angiotensin II levels on days 3--6, daily urinary sodium excretion on all individual days as well as cumulative sodium balance were the same during both periods. Therefore, we could find no evidence in man that suppression of circulating angiotensin II levels is causally related to escape from mineralocorticoid excess.", 
    "112": "Although the resting hemodynamic effects of captopril in congestive heart failure are known, little information is available about the hemodynamic response to captopril during exercise or about changes in noninvasive measurements of the size and function of both ventricles. In this study, 14 stable New York Heart Association class III patients were given 25 mg or oral captopril. Rest and exercise hemodynamic measurements and blood pool scintigrams were performed simultaneously before and 90 minutes after captopril. The radionuclide studies were analyzed for left and right ventricular end-diastolic volumes, end-systolic volumes, ejection fractions and pulmonary blood volume. The primary beneficial responses at rest were decreases in left and right ventricular end-diastolic volumes from 388 +/- 81 to 350 +/- 77 ml (p less than 0.01) and from 52 +/- 26 to 43 +/- 20 volume units (p less than 0.01), respectively, and in their corresponding filling pressures, from 24 +/- 10 to 17 +/- 9 mm Hg and 10 +/- 5 to 6 +/- 5 mm Hg (both p less than 0.001). Although stroke volume did not increase significantly, both left and right ventricular ejection fractions increased slightly, from 19 +/- 6% to 22 +/- 5% and from 25 +/- 9% to 29 +/- 11%, respectively (both p less than 0.01). During exercise, similar changes were noted in both hemodynamic and radionuclide indexes. Thus, in patients with moderate symptomatic limitation from chronic heart failure, captopril predominantly reduces ventricular volume and filling pressure, with a less significant effect on cardiac output. These effects persist during exercise, when systemic vascular resistance is already very low. Radionuclide techniques are valuable in assessing the drug effect in these subjects, particularly when ventricular volumes are also measured.", 
    "113": "Captopril (100 mg/kg, q.d., orally, from the 6th week of age) strongly inhibits genetic hypertension development (GHD) and this effect persists up to 12 weeks after treatment discontinuation. However, during these 12 weeks, systolic blood pressure and heart weight/body weight ratio (HW/BW) show a similar trend to slowly increase. We have investigated whether identical phenomena develop at the vascular level. Captopril strongly increased vascular mesenteric compliance, reduced aortic wall weight, mesenteric arterial wall lumen ratio and active contractile ability during treatment period and these effects were still observed up to 7 weeks after treatment interruption although there was a slight but progressive reduction in their intensity. Thus captopril opposes the structural and functional vascular and cardiac alterations which accompany GHD and this effect contributes to a large extent to the long-lasting preventive effects of the drug against GHD.", 
    "114": "Substance \"P\" (SP) and its derivatives inhibited activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in human blood serum, I50 for SP was 31 microM. The same results were obtained for N-terminal fragments of the SP molecule: Arg-Pro-Lys-Pro and Lys-Pro. The C-terminal heptapeptide and the dipeptide Arg-Pro negligibly inhibited ACE activity. A possible significance of the interaction between SP and ACE in the regulation of the microhemodynamics is discussed.", 
    "115": "The potential antagonistic effect of high doses of Captopril on renal vascular response to exogenous administration or nerve stimulated release of norepinephrine (NE) was assessed in isolated blood-free perfused rat and rabbit kidneys respectively. At the doses of 0,09 mM and 0,45 mM in rat kidney, captopril blunted significantly the vasoconstrictor effect of exogenous NE (20, 40 and 100 ng) whilst responses to angiotensin II (2,5 and 10 ng) were slightly reduced at the highest dose and responses to serotonin (20, 40 and 100 mg) remained unaffected by either doses of Captopril. The other effective converting enzyme inhibitor, SQ 20881 had no effect on pressor responses to norepinephrine at similar doses. In preliminary rabbit studies, a likewise blunting of pressor effect of exogenous norepinephrine was obtained at the doses of captopril of 0,23 mM and 0,45 mM. Furthermore, these doses of captopril had no effect on either basal or nerve-stimulated NE release whilst nerve-stimulated vasoconstriction was significantly and reversibly blunted at both doses. These studies suggest a) that the inhibitory effect of Captopril on NE renal vasoconstriction in not primarily dependent on converting enzyme inhibition; b) that the observed alpha-antagonistic activity of high doses of captopril occurs principally at a post-junctional level.", 
    "116": "Twenty patients with severe hypertension and chronic renal failure were given Captopril during a one year period. Hypertension was always severe: BP: 193 +/- 11.8 mmHg/120.2 +/- 6.7 mm Hg. Mean glomerular filtration rate (GRF) was 42 +/- 10 ml/mn and renal plasma flow (RPF) was 160 +/- 35 ml/min. Mean plasma renin activity was 1.5 +/- 1.1 ng/ml/h and plasma aldosterone 15.9 +/- 1.9 ng/100 ml. Captopril was given in daily doses from 75 to 300 mg. Furosemide was added in 13 cases, and b\u00eata inhibitions in 10 cases. Blood pressure and renal function were measured eight days, every month end after one year of treatment: the fall in diastolic blood pressure was 13 p. 100 after eight days, 23 p. 100 after one year; a period of at least 6 months was necessary to obtain normal blood pressure values; and after one year blood pressure was normalized (diastolic BP less than 90 mmHg) in 19 patients. Renal function was compared with pretreatment values, after 8 days and one year: --RPF was increased (+18 p. 100 and +10.3 p. 100); --GFR was unchanged (+3,8 p. 100 and -8.8 p. 100); --filtration fraction was significantly decreased: (-12.3 p. 100 and -18.3 p. 100); --sodium excretion rate (+16 p. 100 and +9.9 p. 100) and kaliemia increased (+10 p. 100 and +8 p. 100) but severe hyperkalemia never occurred; --PRA increased (+270 p. 100 and +400 p. 100); --Plasma aldosterone was decreased after eight days --28.9 p. 100 but identical to control after one year -4.4 p. 100. Diuretics were efficient to enhance the antipressor of Captopril, whereas b\u00eata inhibitions appeared less useful, and may be indicated only when tachycardia occurs. These results show that long term use of Captopril alone or associated with Furosemide, can normalise blood pressure in patients with renal insufficiency, without any impairment in GFR, and with an increase in RBF.", 
    "117": "High levels of angiotensin I converting enzyme are present in rat intestinal mucosa and in intestinal arteries. Homogenates of both tissues were subfractionated and fractions enriched in vascular plasma membrane or intestinal brush border were prepared. The preparations were identified and their purities established by marker enzyme enrichment and/or electron microscopy. Converting enzyme activity was highly enriched on both the vascular plasma membrane and the intestinal brush border. Subsequently the properties of these membrane-bound enzymes were compared. Both surface membrane-bound enzymes were highly sensitive to inhibition by captopril (SQ 14225) and teprotide (SQ 20881). Similar to converting enzyme isolated from other sources, they were also inhibited by bradykinin, angiotensin I, EDTA and o-phenanthroline. Finally, both membrane-bound enzymes were relatively resistant to activation by sonication, freezing and thawing or detergent. These results demonstrate significant similarities between surface membrane-bound converting enzyme from vascular and non-vascular sites. In addition, in view of the possible relationship of kinins and angiotensins to gastrointestinal function and blood flow, inhibition of gastrointestinal converting enzyme by captopril may affect some aspects of intestinal physiology.", 
    "118": "Fifteen patients with severe or malignant resistant arterial hypertension were treated by simultaneous administration of captopril and labetalol. Seven patients (group A) were given captopril alone and 8 patients (group B) labetalol alone without noticeable results. However, when the two drugs were given jointly a significant fall in mean arterial pressure from 165 +/- 19.8 (+/- 1 S.D.) to 102.4 +/- 15.1 mmHg (p less than 0.001) in group A patients and from 162.7 +/- 20 to 117 +/- 21.4 mmHg (p less than 0.05) in group B patients was observed. There were no significant changes in heart rate, a few side-effects were recorded. The captopril-labetalol combination may be considered as a useful alternative treatment of resistant arterial hypertension.", 
    "119": "Having observed that treatment of rats with captopril led to an increased ACE activity in serum and ACE concentration in lungs, we treated female Wistar Kyoto rats for 7 days with the esterified ACE inhibitor, MK-421 (1.0 mg/kg body weight per day), administered by Alzet osmotic minipump. Serum ACE activity decreased by 67% during MK-421 treatment when measured in non-dialyzed serum samples. Removal of the drug by dialysis unmasked a 280% increase of serum ACE activity. ACE concentration of crude lung homogenate increased 134% in MK-421-treated rats and ACE concentration in purified pulmonary plasma membranes increased by 34%. The increase of serum and lung ACE in MK-421-treated rats was similar to that seen in rats treated with captopril, and was probably due to induction of ACE biosynthesis. The mechanisms of this induction are unknown.", 
    "120": "In urethane-anesthetized rabbits, bradykinin caused a dose-dependent hypotension. This hypotensive response was not altered in magnitude but was inhibited in duration after pretreatment with nicotine. Nicotine failed to inhibit the hypotensive effect of eledoisine, prostacyclin, isoprenaline and papaverine. Aspirin pretreatment, however, caused a marked inhibition in both magnitude and duration of the hypotensive effect of bradykinin without altering that of eledoisine, isoprenaline, papaverine and prostacyclin. Bradykinin also produced a concentration-dependent fall in perfusion pressure of the isolated perfused guinea-pig heart. Addition of nicotine to the perfusion medium caused a significant inhibition in both magnitude and duration of the vasodilator response to bradykinin. Nicotine did not alter the vasodilation induced by prostacyclin. Nicotine also failed to abolish the vasodilator effects of isoprenaline, histamine, papaverine and eledoisine in the coronary circulation. Other antagonists such as atropine, propranolol, cimetidine did not alter the vasodilator effect of bradykinin. These results were taken as the evidence indicating that the vasodilator action of bradykinin is mediated through the release of prostaglandins; the peptide selectivity increases the release of prostacyclin and this prostacyclin contributes to the bradykinin-induced vasodilation in guinea-pig coronary vessels.", 
    "121": "The metabolism of [14C]captopril has been investigated in vitro and in vivo in male Wistar rats. The formation of conjugates of [14C]captopril with plasma proteins was observed both in vitro and in vivo: 180 min after intravenous infusion of [14C]captopril 35 +/- 5% of total radioactivity was covalently bound to plasma proteins. The fate of [14C]captopril-plasma protein conjugates was investigated in vivo. [14C]Captopril was incubated in vitro with rat and human plasma and the resulting captopril-protein conjugates were infused into male rats. The plasma concentration of [14C]captopril-rat plasma protein conjugates declined monoexponentially with a half-life of 71.1 +/- 2.2 min. After 180 min 28 +/- 3% of the radioactivity was excreted in urine, largely as [14C]captopril-cysteine mixed disulphide (67%). Thus although captopril readily forms covalent bonds with plasma proteins the resulting conjugates dissociate in vivo. The toxicological implications of these findings are discussed.", 
    "122": "We have performed a long-term (6-16 months) administration of captopril in 6 hypertensive patients with renal failure undergoing hemodialysis. They were divided into two groups according to the basal renin levels (pretreatment plasma renin activity, PRA), that is, high PRA group (3 patients) and normal PRA group (3 patients). 1) In the high PRA group efficient reduction of blood pressure was obtained by small doses of captopril. In the normal PRA group, however, slight or no pressure reduction was observed. Appropriate initial dose was 10-15 mg/day and maintenance one was 75 mg/day in high PRA group. 2) Hemodialysis potentiated the hypotensive action of captopril in the high PRA group through massive removal of sodium and water. 3) In the normal PRA group PRA was regulated by serum sodium concentration and the plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) was by serum potassium concentration, but in the high PRA group PRA and PAC were mainly regulated by captopril itself. 4) In one patient an adverse reaction consisting of strong bradycardia, dyspnea, chest pain and cold sweat was observed soon after the start of captopril medication. From these results, it was concluded that captopril was as excellent drug for the control of severe hypertension in dialysed patients having a high basal renin level.", 
    "123": "While transection of either the anterior (including hepatic) or posterior (including coeliac) vagal trunk failed to alter drinking in response to subcutaneous histamine (0.312--20 mg/kg), selective gastric vagotomy severely attenuated drinking after systemic histamine (1.25--40 mg/kg) in male Sprague-Dawley rats. The dose-response curve for rats with gastric vagotomy was shifted to the right. Vagotomy increased the threshold dose nearly tenfold and more than doubled the ED50. Because the effect of vagotomy on histamine-elicited drinking was not mimicked by cholinergic blockade of vagal efferents using atropine methyl nitrate (10 mg/kg), these results demonstrate that gastric vagal afferents are necessary for a normal drinking response to systemic histamine. When gastric vagotomy was combined with intragastric SQ14,225 (to inhibit the conversion of peripheral angiotensin I to angiotensin II) drinking after systemic histamine was abolished. These results suggest that gastric vagal afferents and angiotensin II are necessary for systemic histamine to elicit drinking in the rat.", 
    "124": "Captopril, a competitive inhibitor of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE), is an orally potent antihypertensive agent. Light and electron microscopic studies of th kidneys of mice, rats, and monkeys given large oral doses of captopril for long duration were conducted. All mice and some rats and monkeys developed hyperplasia of the renin-secreting cells which appeared in several layers surrounding the vascular wall of the afferent arterioles. In the electron microscope, these epithelioid cells appeared heavily loaded with aggregates of homogeneous electron dense, osmiophilic amorphous granules filling distended spaces of the endoplasmic reticulum. The Golgi cisterns often included small, sharply outlined triangular or rhomboid osmiophilic granules. The use of specific renin antibodies and the application of the \"three-layer bridge technique\" for peroxidase-antiperoxidase defined and verified the accumulation of renin in the juxtaglomerular cells. After cessation of dosing, hyperplasia of the juxtaglomerular cells markedly regressed, and there was a significant reduction in the number and size of the renin granules in such cells.", 
    "125": "The interaction of cardiac function and sympathetic tone in severe chronic heart failure was evaluated in 24 patients by assessing the cardiac index/plasma norepinephrine relationship. Potential changes were assessed during first-dose and long-term captopril therapy including sympathetic responsiveness to the gravitational stress of head-up tilt. Because cardiac index and norepinephrine levels demonstrated a significant inverse correlation (r = -0.640, p less than 0.001). Norepinephrine decreased from 803 +/- 116 to 635 +/- 76 pg/ml following first-dose captopril therapy (p less than 0.02), with overall hemodynamic improvement. However significant first-dose correlations were not observed. During long-term therapy, norepinephrine decreased from 694 +/- 118 to 457 +/- 106 pg/ml, associated with improvement of symptoms and exercise tolerance. The extent of cardiac index increase was matched by norepinephrine reduction, so that their correlation was maintained (r = -0.540, p less than 0.02). First-dose and long-term therapy were associated with improved responsiveness of sympathetic tone to the reduction of cardiac index induced by the gravitational stress of tilt. In summary, sympathetic tone was increased in severe heart failure, correlating inversely with cardiac function. Although there was improvement of cardiac function with first-dose captopril therapy, significant correlations of supine improvement with reduction of sympathetic tone were noted primarily with long-term therapy. Responsiveness of sympathetic tone to the stress of tilt however, was evident during first-dose and long-term therapy.", 
    "126": "The contribution of sympathetic tone and the renin-angiotensin system to the pathogenesis of chronic heart failure was evaluated. In 20 paired studies of the same 10 patients, the baseline hemodynamic and humoral correlates of congestive heart failure, and the response to alpha adrenergic blockade (prazosin) and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition (captopril) were assessed. Despite the extent of failure, baseline plasma renin activity ranged from normal to very high. In contrast, baseline plasma catecholamine levels were always elevated. Baseline plasma norepinephrine reflected the severity of heart failure, correlating inversely with baseline cardiac index before administration of both drugs. Comparable improvement in left ventricular function was noted after acute therapy. Baseline renin and norepinephrine did not predict the response to prazosin, but baseline renin did predict the response to captopril: pulmonary wedge pressure (r=-0.776, p less than 0.01), stroke index (r=0.752, p less than 0.02), systemic vascular resistance (r=-0.673, p less than 0.05). In summary, elevated levels of plasma norepinephrine were inversely correlated with baseline cardiac function but norepinephrine levels did not change despite improved hemodynamics with specific prazosin therapy. The renin-angiotensin system exhibited a wide spectrum of activity and hemodynamic improvement with captopril was related to this activity. Absence of a correlation between plasma norepinephrine and plasma renin activity suggested that their contributions to vasoconstriction were not interdependent. Increased sympathetic tone was consistent in severe heart failure, whereas renin-angiotensin activity differed widely. The response to captopril can be used to identify a subset of patients with severe heart failure and adverse angiotensin-mediated vasoconstriction.", 
    "127": "Intracisternal injections of hypertonic NaCl elicited the pressor responses in urethane anesthetized spontaneously hypertensive and normotensive Wistar rats. The intracisternal pretreatment of 1-Sar-8-Ile-angiotensin II, angiotensin II analog, could abolish the pressor responses to intracisternal injections of 5% NaCl in urethane anesthetized spontaneously hypertensive rats, while basal blood pressure was not affected by these pretreatment. Both intracisternal and intravenous administration of captopril, an angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor, did not alter the pressor effect of hypertonic NaCl in normotensive rats. Basal blood pressure was lowered by intravenous injection of captopril. The involvement of angiotensin II in the pressor mechanism of hypertonic NaCl was confirmed by the enhanced pressor responses to intracisternal injections of 5% NaCl in urethane anesthetized rats pretreated intracisternally with angiotensin II. These findings suggest that angiotensin II itself could play an important role in the pressor responses to intracisternal injections of hypertonic NaCl without involving a converting enzyme system.", 
    "128": "The present study was conducted to investigate the influence of captopril on cardiochemodynamic responses in 38 normal volunteers (20- to 35-year-old men) to exogenously administered vasopressor substances. Norepinephrine (NE), 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 micrograms/kg min-1; angiotensin II (AII), 5, 10, and 20 ng/kg min-1; and pitressin (2 mU/kg min-1) were infused for 10 minutes. Each infusion was reported twice, and the responses were reproducible. Captopril (50 mg by mouth) significantly attenuated the pressor responses to NE and pitressin, but the decrease in heart rate in response to NE and pitressin was almost the same before and after captopril treatment, suggesting that captopril potentiates reflex slowing of the heart. Captopril significantly potentiated the pressor response to AII. Attenuation of pressor response and potentiation of reflex slowing of the heart, in response to NE and pitressin, disappeared when a subdepressor dose of AII (1 ng/kg min-1) was infused in addition to captopril. Infusion of a subdepressor dose of bradykinin (BK), 0.1 microgram/kg min-1, had no influence on the pressor response to NE. In the subjects treated with indomethacin (225 mg/54 hrs), captopril still attenuated the pressor response to NE. These results suggest that captopril attenuates the pressor responses to NE and pitressin primarily by depletion of endogenous AII; decreased AII may desensitize the contraction of arterial smooth muscle and may potentiate the compensatory reflex mechanism.", 
    "129": "In adrenal chromaffin cells, various molecular forms of polypeptides cross-reacting with [met5]-enkephalin antisera are stored in granules together with catecholamines and soluble proteins. Splanchnic nerve stimulation increases the release of enkephalin-like peptides from the adrenal gland into the adrenal vein. The release of these peptides appears to be mediated by a cholinergic nicotinic receptor. Fractionation of plasma extracts on Bio-gel P-2 shows the presence of only low molecular weight peptides in the resting condition. The low molecular weight fraction contains mainly [met5]-enkephalin and [leu5]-enkephalin. When the splanchnic nerve is stimulated high and low molecular weight peptides are released and the amount of low molecular weight peptides in plasma is increased. The content of enkephalin-like peptides in adrenal venous plasma was similar in control and reserpinized dogs. Splanchnic nerve stimulation increased the peptide content but not the epinephrine content of plasma in reserpinized dogs. This also caused a fall of arterial blood pressure which could be prevented by pretreatment with naloxone. A decrease in blood pressure was also directly elicited by the injection of [met5]-enkephalin-[arg6-phe7]. The duration of the hypotensive effect of this peptide was prolonged by prior injection of captopril.", 
    "130": "The conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II was studied in the isolated perfused hindquarters of guinea-pig. The relative enzyme activity was determined by vasoconstrictor response to the peptides and by the contraction of rat ascending colon superfused with the venous effluent. 45% of conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II was determined in this preparation as measured by vasoconstrictor responses. However, only 22% of conversion was detected in the venous return as measured in the rat colon. Captopril significantly inhibited angiotensin converting enzyme activity in this preparation. Acetylsalicylic acid, however, partially prevented the inhibitory effect of Captopril on converting enzyme activity in this vascular bed. The possible interactions of angiotensin converting enzyme activity and endogenous prostaglandins are discussed.", 
    "131": "The hypotensive response to captopril is described for 12 hypertensive patients, 7 of whom had renovascular hypertension. The drug was effective in lowering blood pressure. The few reversible adverse reactions that occurred included loss of the sense of taste in one patient and rash and fever in another. Three patients with renal failure showed deterioration of renal function during treatment, suggesting the advisability of treating such cases with lower dosages.", 
    "132": "1 The effect of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, MK 421 (N-((S)-1-(ethoxycarbonyl)-3-phenylpropyl)L-Ala-L-Pro), on the blood pressure of two-kidney Goldblatt hypertensive rats has been investigated in relation to he initial plasma renin activity (PRA) and the initial blood pressure of the individual animals. 2 Blood pressure was monitored by an indirect tail-cuff method at 1, 3, 6 and 24 h after dosing. MK 421 produced a fall in blood pressure in the majority of animals, but the extent of this reduction varied considerably between individuals. 3 The change in blood pressure showed a significant correlation with both the initial PRA and the initial blood pressures of the animals. However, only a modest correlation was found between the initial PRA and the degree of hypertension. 4 MK 421 (10 mg/kg, orally) produced a mean blood pressure change which was statistically significant (P less than 0.001) at all times tested. 5 It is concluded that the degree of antihypertensive activity of MK 421 is related to the degree of activity of the renin-angiotensin system which, in this model at least, is reflected by the PRA.", 
    "133": "The existence of angiotensin II (AII) immunoreactivity in juxtaglomerular (JG) cells of rat kidney, which has been demonstrated previously by immunohistochemical studies, can be explained either as the product of intracellular synthesis or by the internalization of receptor-bound AII originating in plasma. To resolve these two alternative mechanisms, attempts were made to identify AI in JG cells of rat kidney by immunohistochemical staining using specific antibodies to AI. Although AI-like immunoreactivity was not detected in normal rat kidney, rats treated with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, MK-421 or captopril, showed AI-like immunoreactivity in JG cells. The presence of renin and AII-like immunoreactivity was demonstrated in the same cells by specific antibodies to respective antigens used on adjacent serial sections. These findings support an intracellular mechanism of the formation of AII and suggest an intracellular renin angiotensin system, presumably separate from the extracellular system.", 
    "134": "To determine whether chronic antihypertensive therapy prevents the progression of cardiac hypertrophy and the deterioration in cardiac performance observed in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) with long-term hypertension, 14-month-old female SHR and normotensive American Wistar rats (NWR) were treated for 10 months with an inhibitor of angiotensin I-converting enzyme, captopril (2 g/liter of drinking water). Captopril reduced the marked left ventricular hypertrophy of 24-month-old SHR (untreated, 4.37 +/- 0.2 mg/g of body weight; treated, 3.01 +/- 0.1 mg/g; P less than 0.02) to levels observed in 6-month-old SHR. Treatment prevented the reductions in baseline and maximal aortic blood flows that occurred in SHR between ages 12 and 24 months yet had no effect on the blood flows of NWR. The diminished maximal stroke volume of untreated SHR was ejected from a significantly increased left ventricular end-diastolic volume, so that the ejection-fraction index was markedly reduced (24-month-old untreated NWR, 84 +/- 3%; untreated SHR, 56 +/- 5%; P less than 0.001). Therapy restores this index in SHR to normal (77 +/- 4%). The relationship between ejection-fraction index, and afterload was also normal in treated SHR. Thus, chronic therapy with captopril produced a marked regression of cardiac hypertrophy and prevented the deterioration of cardiac performance in SHR with long-standing hypertension.", 
    "135": "Captopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme blocker, has recently been released for limited clinical use in the treatment of refractory congestive heart failure and severe hypertension. The only major dermatologic side effects from this medication have been either an urticarial or an erythematous, maculopapular eruption. This paper presents what I believe to be the first reported case of exfoliative erythroderma associated with the use of captopril. Although this medication may be lifesaving with its minimal side effects, close attention should be paid to the dermatologic side effects of this drug.", 
    "136": "Although chronic potassium deficiency is a common clinical problem, the hemodynamic consequences of chronic sustained potassium depletion have not been clearly delineated. In this study, the hemodynamic consequences of chronic potassium depletion were evaluated in the conscious rat. Potassium-depleted rats had a decrease in mean arterial pressure which was caused by a decrease in systemic vascular resistance. In association with these changes in systemic hemodynamics, renal blood flow (RBF) was also decreased. The decreased renal blood flow was caused by an increased renal vascular resistance (RVR). Because plasma renin activity was increased the role of angiotensin II as a renal vasoconstrictor was evaluated by utilizing two angiotensin antagonists. Although the administration of saralasin to potassium-depleted rats did not alter systemic hemodynamics, RVR was decreased and RBF was increased. Similar results were obtained with the converting enzyme inhibitor teprotide. Because products of endoperoxide metabolism may cause renal vasoconstriction, the role of prostaglandins and thromboxanes as renal vasoconstrictors were evaluated by utilizing cyclo-oxygenase and thromboxane synthetase inhibitors. None of these agents altered systemic hemodynamics. Following the administration of indomethacin, RVR was decreased and RBF was increased in potassium-depleted rats. Similar results were obtained with another cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, meclofenamate, and with imidazole, an inhibitor of thromboxane synthetase. Because neither angiotensin II nor products of endoperoxide metabolism could alone account for the increased renal vascular resistance of potassium depletion, studies were performed in potassium-depleted rats treated with indomethacin plus either saralasin or teprotide. In these potassium-depleted animals, renal blood flow was restored to normal. In conclusion, the decrease in renal blood flow and the increase in renal vascular resistance in potassium depletion is mediated by angiotensin II and a product of prostaglandin endoperoxide metabolism, most likely, thromboxane.", 
    "137": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, E.C. 3.4.15.1) activity has been documented in eight cultures of fibroblasts with the ACE substrates benzoyl-phe-ala-pro and hippuryl-his-leu. Hydrolysis of these ACE substrates by fibroblasts is inhibited by SQ-14225 and SQ-20881, specific inhibitors of ACE activity, and by EDTA. However, ACE activity in seven of eight cultures of fibroblasts tested is less than ACE activity in two cultures of vascular endothelial cells. The rats of hydrolysis of benzoyl-phe-ala-pro by fibroblasts and by endothelial cells differ at high substrate concentrations; therefore, the ACE activity in fibroblasts may be due to either a different isoenzyme of ACE of a different accessibility to substrate. Production of angiotensin II from angiotensin I is documented in cultures of vascular endothelial cells but not in cultures of fibroblasts, however, angiotensin II is further degraded by fibroblasts and not by endothelial cells.", 
    "138": "Captopril (SQ 14 225) was administered to normotensive, sodium-replete volunteers in order to investigate the relationships between its haemodynamic effects and effects on sympathetic activity, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and plasma-converting enzyme activity. Following the administration of captopril (25 mg) orally, mean arterial pressure fell (supine 89.1 +/- 5.9 to 81.1 +/- 3.3 mm Hg, p less than 0.01; erect 98.5 +/- 5.5 to 87.4 +/- 6.7 mm Hg, p less than 0.01) but heart rate did not change. Plasma noradrenaline rose; plasma renin activity and angiotensin I concentration rose, while angiotensin II and aldosterone fell; plasma-converting enzyme was inhibited for 6 h. The extent of blood pressure reduction and converting enzyme inhibition was closely correlated (r = 0.92, p less than 0.001). Plasma captopril concentration was directly related to converting enzyme inhibition in an in vitro study using plasma from the same subjects. In the absence of a convenient assay of captopril, converting enzyme may be used as an index of captopril concentration in the further study of kinetic and dynamic relationships.", 
    "139": "The effects of three angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors - captopril, MK-421 diacid, and teprotide - on renal vascular responses to graded (50, 100, 200 ng) injections of norepinephrine (NE) were examined in rat isolated perfused kidneys, having a mean basal perfusion pressure of 78 +/- 10 mm Hg. The minimum dose of captopril (0.05 microgram/ml, low dose) that abolished the vasoconstrictor responses to 100 and 200 ng angiotensin I did not affect NE-induced renal vasoconstriction, whereas a dose 100 times greater (high-dose captopril, 5 micrograms/ml) reduced the vasoconstrictor action of NE. MK-421 diacid also at high dose (1 microgram/ml), caused similar reduction in renal vasoconstrictor responses to NE. In contrast, a high dose of teprotide (50 micrograms/ml) did not affect renal vascular responsiveness to NE. The threshold dose of NE that released prostaglandins, measured by bioassay, was 50 ng. Indomethacin (1 microgram/ml) prevented NE-induced release of prostaglandins but did not affect the ability of captopril to attenuate NE-induced vasoconstriction. We conclude that captopril and MK-421 diacid decreases vascular reactivity in the rat isolated kidney by a mechanism independent of ACE inhibition and unrelated to a prostaglandin-dependent vascular mechanism. Moreover, the presence of mercapto function in the ACE inhibitor is not essential since captopril, which has a sulfhydryl group, and MK-421 diacid, which lacks this group, have similar effects on renal vascular responsiveness.", 
    "140": "Renal biopsy material was studied from 38 hypertensive patients, 19 of whom had received captopril for at least six months. Comparable immunofluorescence findings and prominent arteriolar and mesangial deposits of C3 and IgM were noted equally in all patients. Within the non-captopril group one biopsy showed mesangial IgA glomerulonephritis and, in another, microscopy revealed typical membranous glomerulonephritis. The biopsy specimens from 4 patients in the captopril group showed evidence of glomerular deposits and 2 had typical membranous glomerulonephritis. Small, spherical electron-dense deposits were seen with equal frequency along the outer aspect of the glomerular basement membrane in both groups, but were not thought to be immune deposits. Renal biopsy material from hypertensive patients may have ultrastructural and immunohistological abnormalities which cannot be ascribed to captopril. Subclinical glomerulonephritis appears to exist in the hypertensive population. The membranous glomerulonephritis could be drug-related, but this cannot be determined with certainty from the small sample studied. Caution must be shown in attributing glomerulonephritis to any drug without information about the kidneys before treatment.", 
    "141": "A gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric method for the simultaneous determination of captopril (SQ 14,255) and its disulphide (SQ 14,551) in biological fluids by means of selected ion monitoring is described. In order to prevent oxidative degradation, captopril was treated with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM). The captopril-NEM adduct and the disulphide were converted into the hexafluoroisopropyl esters, which were separated on a 10% Dexsil 300 GC column and determined by employing the captopril-N-butylmaleimide adducts as an internal standard. The blood and urine levels of captopril and its disulphide in dogs to which captopril had been administered orally were measured by the proposed method. The urinary excretion of these two substances in rats was also determined in a similar manner.", 
    "142": "The intrathecal administration of thiorphan (dl-3-mercapto-2-benzylpropranoyl-glycine) had no effect in doses up to 70 microgram on the rat hot plate and tail flick. Administrations of these doses of thiorphan concurrently or up to 1 h prior to the intrathecal administration of [D-Ala2, Met5] enkephalin resulted in a dose dependent, leftward shift in the peptide dose response curve. The potentiation was maximal with 35 micrograms, higher doses producing no greater potentiation. The potentiated effects of [D-Ala2,Met5] enkephalin were totally antagonized by systemically administered naloxone. Similarly, in the primate, concurrent administration of thiorphan alone in doses up to 70 microgram, had little effect on the hot plate or tail flick in the rat. 200 microgram resulted in a significant increase in hot plate, but not tail flick response latency. The increase observed on the hot plate, was partially antagonized by naloxone. In the primate, doses of intrathecal thiorphan (400-800 microgram) had no effect on the shock titration threshold. Higher doses resulted in an increase in the titration threshold, which was not antagonized by naloxone. These experiments appear to indicate the relevance of the thiorphan-sensitive inactivation system in the spinal cord to the relative potency of exogenously administered opioid peptides.", 
    "143": "In conscious male New Zealand rabbits, bradykinin caused dose-dependent (0.03-1 microgram/kg i.v.) hypotension and reflex tachycardia. After inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE, also known as kininase II) with captopril (1 mg/kg i.v.), the hypotensive effect of bradykinin was enhanced in magnitude and duration but the normally observed tachycardia was reversed to bradycardia. In rabbits treated with indomethacin to inhibit cyclooxygenase and then given captopril, the bradycardia to bradykinin reverted to tachycardia whereas the magnitude of the initial hypotensive effect was unchanged. However, inhibition of thromboxane synthetase with SQ 80,338 (1-[3-phenyl-2-propenyl]-1H-imidazole) was without effect on either bradykinin-induced hypotension or bradycardia in captopril treated rabbits. Infusion of nicotine to inhibit prostacyclin synthetase completely reversed the bradycardia induced by bradykinin in captopril-treated rabbits, an effect unrelated to ganglion blockade by nicotine since mecamylamine had no effect on the actions of bradykinin. beta-Adrenoceptor blockade with nadolol did not modify the bradycardia caused by bradykinin in captopril-treated rabbits whereas atropine methylnitrate caused a marked reduction. Captopril had no inhibitory effect on reflex tachycardia caused by nitroglycerin or acetylcholine and only reduced that caused by eledoisin. Hypotension and bradycardia resulted from giving rabbits prostacyclin (100 microgram/kg i.v.). These results suggest that the bradycardia observed in conscious rabbits to bradykinin after captopril treatment is the result of an increase in circulating bradykinin due to ACE (kininase II) inhibition leading to a vago-vagal reflex induced by the synthesis of prostaglandins, probably prostacyclin.", 
    "144": "The glomerular filtration rate (creatinine clearance), glomerular permeability (qualitative and quantitative proteinuria), tubular reabsorption (k-lambda chains of immunoglobulins and lysozyme) and indexes of tubular cell lysis (alpha-glucosidase and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase) were measured in the urine of 10 patients with moderate, uncomplicated essential hypertension during placebo therapy and after captopril given at increasing doses of 25, 50, 100 and 200 mg twice daily, the first three doses being given for 3 days and the last one for 4 weeks in all patients and for an additional 6 months in 5 patients. During placebo therapy, proteinuria was absent in eight patients and detectable (glomerular and selective) in two; selective proteinuria appeared in two and a decrease in selectivity was observed in two patients with previous proteinuria after 4 weeks of captopril therapy. No proteinuria was detectable in the five patients followed up to 6 months, not even in the one in whom a decrease in glomerular selectivity had occurred after 4 weeks. The glomerular filtration rate was unchanged as were lysozyme and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase values, while light chains were always undetectable. Alpha-glucosidase showed some increase; however, increments were transient and always much lower than those observed with known tubular toxic drugs. These data show that under our experimental conditions captopril caused no evident changes in glomerular and tubular function.", 
    "145": "The effects of captopril (SQ 14225) on renal function were studied in 10 hypertensive patients. After 7 weeks of treatment (75 to 500 mg/day) renal plasma flow was practically unchanged and glomerular filtration rate was only slightly decreased despite a significant decrease in blood pressure. All indexes of glomerular capillary permeability and of tubular anatomic integrity remained normal during the treatment period.", 
    "146": "Captopril and propranolol were given alone and in combination to 13 hypertensive men and the effects studied at rest (seated, supine and standing) and during exercise. The two drugs were equipotent at rest, and individual patients showed similar blood pressure responses to the two drugs. Both produced slight reduction of urinary aldosterone; when given in combination, both blood pressure and aldosterone were further reduced. During exercise the increase in blood pressure was unaffected by captopril but reduced by propranolol, and there was no correlation between individual responses to the two drugs. It is concluded that the similar effects of the two drugs on resting blood pressure are consistent with their effects on the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "147": "Plasma aldosterone concentration was measured in seven patients before and during long-term angiotensin II suppression with captopril. Plasma aldosterone decreased initially from 62 to 9 pg/ml (p less than 0.01) after 1 month of captopril administration. Thereafter, it began to increase and after 1 year reached a level of 163 pg/ml, which significantly (p less than 0.01) exceeded the pretreatment value. During long-term captopril therapy, plasma renin activity remained elevated and plasma angiotensin II concentration suppressed. The mechanism responsible for the late increase in plasma aldosterone during long-term angiotensin II suppression with captopril remains to be elucidated. Body weight decreased initially, parallel to plasma aldosterone increase, but after 6 months increased again to reach its pretreatment level after 1 year. Nevertheless a sizable and lasting hypotensive effect was observed in all patients.", 
    "148": "The antihypertensive effect of captopril and its mechanism of action were studied in patients with essential and renal hypertension. In mild essential hypertension (n = 12), during monotherapy with captopril (50 to 450 mg, 4 to 12 weeks) blood pressure was normalized in seven, improved in two and remained unchanged in three patients, plasma levels of active and acid-activatable inactive renin significantly increased and angiotensin II decreased, whereas no consistent changes in urinary kallikrein excretion occurred. In severe renal (n = 14) and essential (n = 9) hypertension, blood pressure was normalized in eight (seven with renal hypertension), improved in seven and unchanged in eight patients, when captopril (50 to 450 mg, 3 to 15 months) was added to the antihypertensive medication. In one patient with stenosis in a transplanted renal artery reversible renal failure occurred during captopril therapy possibly because of a steep initial decrease in blood pressure, although a toxic effect of the drug cannot be excluded. In another series of 12 renal and 8 essential hypertensive patients, a significant correlation between the acute effect of captopril (within 90 minutes) an saralasin on blood pressure was demonstrated (r=0.71, p less than 0.001). The change in blood pressure after either drug was significantly related to the initial plasma renin concentration. In conclusion, captopril seems to be an effective antihypertensive agent in essential and renal hypertension. Renal function should be monitored during captopril therapy. Our studies suggest that captopril decreases blood pressure by inhibiting the vasopressor action of the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "149": "In 25 hypertensive patients (15 with renal artery stenosis and 10 with essential hypertension), captopril, in a single 12.5 mg dose, caused a prompt decrease in arterial pressure without changing the heart rate. Plasma active and trypsin-activated renin significantly increases, whereas inactive renin and plasma aldosterone decreased. The plasma active/inactive renin ratio was also increased, suggesting that captopril, together with a release of active renin, may induce an in vivo activation of inactive renin. No correlations were found between blood pressure changes and both pretreatment and captopril-induced variations of active, inactive and trypsin-activated renin or the active/inactive ratio. However, the percent decrease in mean arterial pressure was significantly related to the increase in the active/inactive renin ratio in a group of patients whose blood pressure was brought to normal (r = -0.78; p less than 0.001). This finding suggests the possibility that vasodilating substances, in addition to inhibiting angiotensin II formation, might play some role both in exerting a full effect of captopril on blood pressure and in triggering the in vivo mechanisms of inactive renin activation.", 
    "150": "The role of prostaglandins and angiotensin II or kinins in maintaining adrenal blood flow was studied using the prostaglandin cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor meclofenamate and the kininase inhibitor captopril in resting and hemorrhaged (10 ml/kg) conscious rabbits. Meclofenamate (6 mg/kg intravenously) reduced adrenal blood flow after 3, 15 and 30 minutes by 26, 28 and 17 percent, respectively. Captopril increased adrenal flow by 20 percent, an effect subsequently reversed by meclofenamate. In contrast, hemorrhaged rabbits maintained adrenal blood flow following meclofenamate and captopril despite substantial reductions in renal blood flow with meclofenamate given before and after captopril. It is concluded that (1) adrenal blood flow at rest is modulated by vasodilator prostaglandins and to a lesser extent angiotensin II or bradykinin. (2) The adrenal effects of meclofenamate and captopril are overriden by hemorrhage, perhaps reflecting the need to increase adrenal hormones during hypovolemic stress. (3) The decrease in plasma catecholamines seen with meclofenamate at rest may be due to reduced adrenal blood flow.", 
    "151": "Twenty severely hypertensive subjects who did not achieve blood pressure control with combination therapy with a vasodilator, a beta-adrenergic blocking agent and a diuretic received the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril. Marked decreases in blood pressure were observed immediately. Achievement of sustained reductions in blood pressure into the normal range for up to 3 years of follow-up required the addition of a diuretic in all patients and of a beta-adrenergic blocking agent in half. As expected, significant increases in plasma renin activity and decreases in plasma aldosterone were seen initially and sustained throughout the study. Plasma and urinary norepinephrine levels, which were markedly increased before captopril treatment, decreased significantly and remained low for the duration of study. These observations suggest a link between the renal pressor and sympathetic systems which may be involved in the pathophysiology of severe, treatment-resistant hypertension, and suggest that part of the antihypertensive action of captopril may be related to a decrease in sympathetic activity secondary to its interference with the generation of angiotensin II.", 
    "152": "The influence of captopril (SQ 14225) on the vascular and norepinephrine-releasing responses to nerve stimulation (2, 5 and 10 Hz) was assessed in isolated blood-free perfused rabbit kidney. At a concentration of 0.23 and 0.46 mM in the perfusion medium, captopril markedly attenuated the vasoconstrictor response but did not influence the release of norepinephrine produced by nerve stimulation. These results suggest that captopril may act as an alpha-antagonist at a postjunctional level.", 
    "153": "The influence of captopril on pressor responses to exogenously administered vasopressor substances was investigated in normal subjects. Norepinephrine (0.05, 0.1 and 0.2 micrograms/kg . min -1; n = 5), angiotensin II (5, 10 and 20 ng/kg . min -1; n = 5) and vasopressin (2 mU/kg . min -1; n = 5) were infused each for 10 minutes; each infusion was repeated twice. Captopril (50 mg orally) significantly attenuated the pressor response to norepinephrine (0.1 [p less than 0.05], 0.2 [p less than 0.01] micrograms/kg . min -1; n = 7) and to vasopressin (p less than 0.01, n = 5), but not to angiotensin II; these responses were reproducible. Attenuation of the pressor responses to norepinephrine did not occur when a subpressor dose of angiotensin II (ng/kg . min-1) was infused in addition to captopril (n = 5). Infusion of a subpressor dose of bradykinin (0.1 ng/kg . min-1) had no influence on the pressor responses to norepinephrine (n = 5). In the five subjects treated with indomethacin (225 mg/54 hours) captopril still attenuated the pressor responses to norepinephrine. These results suggest that the attenuation by captopril of the pressor responses to norepinephrine and vasopressin might have been due to reduction of endogenous angiotensin II.", 
    "154": "THis study was designed to investigate the mechanisms of captopril's chronic effect on arterial pressure and renal function. In dogs maintained on high sodium intake (250 mEq/day), 6 days of captopril infusion caused no change in arterial pressure, renal hemodynamics, sodium excretion or plasma aldosterone concentration. Infusion of captopril for 7 days also caused no significant changes in arterial pressure or renal function in dogs made hypertensive by chronic infusion of angiotensin II and high sodium intake, a model of hypertension in which plasma renin activity is undetectable and prostaglandin and bradykinin formation may be elevated. In dogs maintained on low sodium intake, chronic infusion of captopril decreased arterial pressure and plasma aldosterone concentration markedly while increasing effective renal plasma flow. Infusion of aldosterone (200 micrograms/day) for 8 days during captopril infusion restored plasma aldosterone concentration but did not significantly change arterial pressure or renal function, indicating that decreased plasma aldosterone concentration did not play a major role in the hypertensive and renal effects of captopril. However, angiotensin II infusion (10 ng/kg/min) for 8 days during captopril infusion restored arterial pressure, plasma aldosterone concentration and renal function toward control levels. These data suggest that the effects of captopril on arterial pressure, renal hemodynamics and electrolyte excretion are mediated primarily by decreased angiotensin II formation.", 
    "155": "The antihypertensive, renal and hormonal effects of captopril were studied in 10 patients with essential hypertension. Captopril significantly decreased arterial blood pressure with a concomitant increase in glomerular filtration rate, natriuresis and kaliuresis and a significant selective increase in urinary (renal) prostaglandin E2; other plasma and urinary prostaglandin (F2 alpha, 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha; thromboxane B2) were not significantly changed. The urinary prostaglandin E2 increase was observed even in patients with pretreatment subnormal prostaglandin E2 excretion. Increases in urinary prostaglandin E2 were significantly positively correlated with increases in urinary sodium concentration. It is concluded that the antihypertensive effect of captopril is mediated, at least partially, by prostaglandin E2 release from renal and extrarenal tissues. Captopril enhances natriuresis at a lower perfusion pressure.", 
    "156": "The effect of captopril on intralymphocytic sodium concentration in hypertensive subjects was studied. After acute and chronic treatment the intralymphocytic sodium content decreased. The possibility is discussed that a similar decrease might also occur in smooth muscle cells, thus enhancing the hypotensive effect of captopril.", 
    "157": "Direct effects of captopril on renal function were examined in isolated perfused rat kidneys. Captopril induced a significant increase in urinary volume and urinary sodium excretion (1.8- and 1.7-fold, respectively; both p less than 0.005), whereas urinary potassium excretion and renovascular resistance were not significantly changed. Because the perfusion medium lacks angiotensinogen, kininogen and aldosterone, the natriuretic action in perfused kidneys may not be related to its inhibitory action on angiotensin I converting enzyme or kininase II. Because the natriuresis was not accompanied by changes in renovascular resistance, it is suggested that captopril possesses a direct natriuretic action and that this property may partly explain the mechanism of captopril-induced natriuresis clinically observed.", 
    "158": "The hemodynamic effects of captopril (SQ 14225), an oral inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme, were measured in 10 patients with severe chronic heart failure poorly controlled by digitalis and diuretics. After administration of a 25 mg dose, the cardiac index increased from 1.82 +/- 0.14 to 2.28 +/- 0.30 liters/min/m2 (p less than 0.05) while pulmonary capillary wedge pressure decreased from 22.7 +/- 2.0 to 14.7 +/- 4.7 mm Hg (p less than 0.05). Mean blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance decreased from 85.7 +/- 6.7 to 71.2 +/- 12.0 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) and from 1,909 +/- 246 to 1,362 +/- 347 dynes-s-cm5 (p less than 0.001), respectively. Heart rate did not change significantly. There was an inverse relation between maximal augmentation in cardiac index and maximal reduction in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (r = -0.82, p less than 0.01). While most patients demonstrated a constant hemodynamic benefit after repeated administration of captopril, some exhibited a triphasic response with attenuation of effects after the second dose and restoration of effects after the third dose. These hemodynamic benefits were observed in patients with stable chronic heart failure whose plasma renin activity was within normal range (1.1 to 7.3 ng/ml/hour).", 
    "159": "Thirty-three patients aged 12 to 77 years with severe hypertension uncontrolled on maximal combination therapy (mean arterial pressure on treatment 149 +/- 4 mm Hg) were treated with captopril, 45 to 450 mg daily for up to 30 months. Renovascular lesions were present in 11 and other renal disease in a further 15, of whom 8 had undergone renal transplantation. Good control (mean blood pressure less than 110 mm Hg) was achieved in 11 patients and moderate control (mean blood pressure 110 to 130 mm Hg) in 13. Captopril was given with a diuretic agent in 13 patients, with a diuretic agent and a beta-adrenoreceptor blocker in 13, and with three or more other agents in 7, of whom 4 had undergone renal transplantation. Side effects of rash, fever and gastrointestinal symptoms were observed, but there were no adverse effects on renal function or leukocyte counts. Severe hyperkalemia (potassium level greater than 6.0 mmol/liter) occurred in four patients despite the use of furosemide and low potassium diet. There was no significant correlation between the long-term hypotensive response and the initial decrease in blood pressure during captopril therapy.", 
    "160": "Fifteen patients with hypertension and unilateral renal artery disease were treated with captopril alone; 10 came to operation and were later assessed postoperatively with no drug treatment. Captopril caused both immediate and sustained decreases in plasma angiotensin II and aldosterone, with increases in plasma active renin and blood angiotensin I concentrations. Decrements in systolic and diastolic pressure 2 hours after the first dose of captopril were closely correlated with the initial decreases in plasma angiotensin II. Blood pressure was decreased by long-term captopril therapy irrespective of whether plasma angiotensin II was abnormally high before treatment. The long-term response of both systolic and diastolic pressure correlated well with the response to surgery. By contrast, the blood pressure decrease 2 hours after the initial dose of captopril variously underestimated and overestimated the decrease during prolonged use of the drug and did not relate to surgical outcome. In patients who, before treatment, had secondary aldosteronism, hyponatremia, hypokalemia and sodium and potassium deficiency, captopril corrected these abnormalities. In the remaining patients, long-term captopril therapy did not alter exchangeable sodium, plasma sodium or total body potassium, although plasma potassium levels increased.", 
    "161": "Infusion of captopril at 20, 200, 2,000 and 6,000 micrograms/kg/hour into sodium-depleted conscious dogs produced a rapid, dose-dependent decrease in blood pressure and plasma angiotensin II and III, maximal suppression being achieved at 200 micrograms/kg/hour (97 +/- 14 to 65 +/- 8 [standard deviation] mm Hg, 38 +/- 10.6 to 3.2 +/- 1.5 pmol/liter and 7.0 +/- 4.8 to 1 +/- 0.5 pmol/liter, respectively). Angiotensin I concentration increased with each infusion rate to a maximal 16-fold increase at 6,000 micrograms/kg/hour (26 to 416 pmol/liter). For all infusion rates the percentage decrease in blood pressure correlated with the percentage decrease in plasma angiotensin II (r = 0.65, p less than 0.001). Infusion of captopril at 6,000 micrograms/kg/hour into sodium-loaded dogs also produced a decrease in both blood pressure (117 +/- 9 to 96.6 +/- 11 mm Hg) and plasma angiotension II (11.0 +/- 3 to 1.6 +/- 1.3 pmol/liter). Plasma aldosterone concentrations decreased whereas both blood angiotensin I and renin concentration increased. In another experiment angiotensin II was infused at 2, 6, 18 and 54 ng/kg/min into sodium-depleted dogs firstly without modification and secondly combined with captopril (6,000 micrograms/kg/hour) given for 1 hour before the angiotensin dose-response study and continued throughout. Angiotensin II infusion raised mean arterial pressure and plasma angiotensin II in each animal. However, the angiotensin II blood pressure dose-response curve was shifted downwards and to the right in the captopril-treated animals. These results suggest that arterial pressure and aldosterone secretion in normal dogs are partly dependent on the renin-angiotensin system but that not all of the acute decrease in blood pressure produced by captopril can be explained by the suppression of the acute vasoconstrictor effect of circulating angiotensin II.", 
    "162": "We investigated changes in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in seven patients with essential hypertension during treatment with captopril (SQ 14225) (300 to 450 mg/day) for 12 months. While blood pressure decreased, the plasma-renin concentration increased to 700 percent of the initial value (6.1 +/- 2.5 ng angiotensin l/ml . h) and angiotensin I increased to about 300 percent of the basal value (179 +/- 32 pg/ml). Converting enzyme inhibition resulted in a 30 percent decrease in plasma angiotension II levels from a basal level of 66 +/- 21 pg/ml. Plasma aldosterone decreased 52 percent from 63 +/- 13 pg/ml initially. These changes in hormone levels were maintained throughout the study. There was no significant change in serum sodium and serum potassium concentration.", 
    "163": "The pharmacokinetic properties of captopril were studied in two groups of hypertensive patients; (1) those who had never taken captopril (acute group), and (2) those who had been taking captopril for at least 6 months (chronic group). It was found that after 100 mg of captopril orally, the mean peak plasma level in the chronic group was three times higher than that in the acute group while the area under the curve was twice as high in the chronic group. These data suggest that bioavailability increases with chronic administration, and thus it may be possible to reduce the dosage of captopril and still maintain blood pressure control while reducing side effects.", 
    "164": "The hemodynamic and hormonal responses to acute and chronic captopril therapy and to its temporary withdrawal were studied in seven patients with congestive heart failure. Maximal hemodynamic and hormonal effects were reached with 25 to 50 mg doses of captopril. Since plasma angiotensin II levels were significantly higher 6 1/2 hours than 1 hour after administration of captopril, the drug should be given not less often than three times daily. No evidence of hormonal \"escape\" during long-term (mean 4 1/2 months) captopril therapy was observed, and initial hemodynamic responses were well maintained. Cessation of captopril administration resulted in abrupt increases in circulating angiotensin II levels, in arterial pressure, and in both pulse rate and plasma norepinephrine, but no decrease in cardiac function in the short-term was detected.", 
    "165": "The long-term effects of captopril therapy were assessed by sequential hemodynamic studies over a 6 month period in 19 patients with resistant congestive heart failure. Initial improvement during the first week of therapy was noted only in 11 and was marked by significant (p less than 0.005) increases in cardiac output and stroke volume, slowing of heart rate, and reduction of total peripheral resistance. Of the remaining eight patients, seven improved subsequently with maintained therapy so that by the end of 3 months of treatment only one patient failed to respond significantly. The hemodynamic index that reflected response most consistently was the shortening in pulmonary mean transit time. Simultaneously with clinical improvement there was a reduction in cardiopulmonary volume that reflected a reduction in pulmonary congestion and probably systemic vasodilation. Associated with these hemodynamic changes there was an increase in plasma renin activity and a significant reduction in plasma aldosterone, but these changes did not differ significantly between patients who responded markedly and those who responded moderately to converting enzyme inhibition. These results suggest that the response of congestive heart failure to captopril can occur gradually. Improvement was related to peripheral hemodynamic changes which led to a reduction in both total peripheral resistance and cardiopulmonary volume. The reduction in the plasma aldosterone/renin activity ratio was an effective marker of compliance.", 
    "166": "Captopril was used in primary and long-term treatment of 40 treatment-resistant hypertensive patients. Of these, 21 had renovascular hypertension, seven unilateral and fourteen bilateral, and 19 had essential hypertension, 10 with high-renin and 9 with normal-renin profiles. All patients were off treatment when started on captopril therapy and were treated for at least 12 months, on the average for more than 2 years. The strategy of systematic drug withdrawal used to find the lowest effective dose of captopril led to average doses of 150 to 300 mg/day. A diuretic agent was added in 17 of the 40 patients when diastolic pressure remained greater than 105 mm Hg and a beta-adrenergic blocking agent was added for tachycardia or additional pressure control in 16 patients. Captopril alone was effective in 14 of the 40 patients. In all groups, mean supine and standing blood pressure levels were maintained at less than 140/90 mm Hg without evidence of decreased effectiveness over time. Control and treatment systolic pressures were higher in patients older than 50 years. For patients of all ages, systolic but not diastolic pressure during captopril treatment was higher in the supine position than standing. Plasma renin activity remained significantly elevated over time and aldosterone excretion usually decreased despite concurrent diuretic therapy. Captopril alone or in combination with a diuretic or beta-adrenergic blocking agent is effective in long-term treatment of drug-resistant renovascular and essential hypertension.", 
    "167": "Captopril lowers blood pressure without increasing heart rate and plasma norepinephrine, which suggests that this drug may potentiate arterial baroreflexes. In eight subjects with untreated essential hypertension, blood pressure was monitored intraarterially and the effects of baroreceptor stimulation or deactivation were assessed by measuring (1) the slopes of the relations between increase or reduction in systolic pressure (intravenous phenylephrine or nitroglycerin) and the resulting lengthening or shortening in R-R interval, and (2) the increase or decrease in mean arterial pressure induced by increasing and decreasing carotid transmural pressure (neck chamber). The measurements were made before and after a hypotensive oral dose of captopril (50 mg). Before captopril, the slopes of the R-R interval changes with increase and reduction in systolic pressure were 8 and 4 ms/mm Hg, respectively. The slopes of the mean arterial pressure changes with increase and reduction in carotid transmural pressure were 0.51 and 0.40 mm Hg, respectively. After captopril, the responses to baroreceptor stimulation were unaltered but those to baroreceptor deactivation were augmented. The pressor and heart rate responses to hand-grip and cold exposure were unchanged by captopril. Administration of captopril is accompanied by a baroreflex potentiation which involves the lower portion of the stimulus-response curve of the reflex. This phenomenon (which may originate at the afferent baroreceptor fibers or centrally) may avoid a reduction in the tonic baroreflex influence during captopril-induced hypotension, thus contributing to the hemodynamic effects of the drug.", 
    "168": "To compare the hemodynamic and humoral effects of increasing doses of captopril, blood pressure, heart rate, plasma renin activity, plasma aldosterone and angiotensin-converting enzyme activity were measured in 10 patients with mild uncomplicated essential hypertension before and after captopril given in an increasing dose of 25, 50 and 100 mg twice a day, with each dose given for 3 days. The maximal decrease in blood pressure, which was predicted both by basal plasma renin activity values and by the hypotensive response to the first dose, was found after the lowest (25 mg) dose; this effect was detectable for 12 hours independently of the dose administered. Similarly, plasma renin activity was already maximally increased and plasma aldosterone maximally decreased at the lowest dose, while angiotensin-converting enzyme activity showed a dose-dependent inhibition. These data suggest that (1) neither the magnitude nor the duration of the hypotensive effect nor the resin-stimulating and aldosterone-inhibiting actions of captopril are enhanced by drug doses above 25 mg (at least up to 100 mg), and (2) there was no apparent correlation between the degree of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition with increasing doses of captopril and the hypotensive effects of the drug.", 
    "169": "There is no general agreement on the relation between the hypotensive effect of captopril and the pretreatment plasma renin levels of hypertensive patients. To determine whether the hypotensive effect of captopril was directly related to plasma renin, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor was administered acutely to 10 essential hypertensive patients with normal or suppressed plasma renin activity before and after inhibition of renin secretion with propranolol. Captopril was equally effective in reducing blood pressure both when administered alone (25 mg: -29/-17; 50 mg: -37/-23 mm Hg) and after chronic treatment with propranolol (25 mg: -33/-20; 50 mg: -30/-20 mm Hg). The increase in renin induced by captopril was not decreased by propranolol therapy. The persistence of the hypotensive effect of captopril after renin suppression by propranolol suggests that this drug has some blood pressure decreasing properties independent of plasma renin.", 
    "170": "The effects of captopril and MK 421, both orally active angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, on sympathetic function in the pithed spontaneously hypertensive rats were examined. Captopril (100 mg/kg orally) significantly inhibited pressor responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation and norepinephrine whereas MK 421 (10 and 100 mg/kg orally) was without effect. Both drugs abolished the angiotensin I response without affecting that to angiotensin II. Because these doses of MK 421 are antihypertensive in the spontaneously hypertensive rat, it is concluded that inhibition of sympathetic function plays no role in its effect. The role of the sympatholytic action of captopril in its antihypertensive action remains unclear.", 
    "171": "Intravenous administration of captopril (20 micrograms) produced inhibition of angiontensin I pressor responses by 70 percent and of plasma-converting enzyme activity by 72 percent. Oral treatment with captopril (50 mg/kg/day) for 1 week inhibited angiotensin I pressor responses more (84 percent) than plasma-converting enzyme activity (23 percent). Four month oral treatment of normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive rats with captopril (50 mg/kg/day) led to 68 and 71 percent inhibition of angiotensin I pressor responses, but produced increases in plasma-converting enzyme activity of 123 and 94 percent, respectively. In spontaneously hypertensive rats, elevated converting enzyme activity in the medulla oblongata was measured after this treatment. It is concluded that plasma-converting enzyme activity measurements can be dissociated from the in vivo inhibition of converting enzyme. Chronic oral captopril treatment results in an induction of converting enzyme biosynthesis not only in peripheral tissue but also in the brain.", 
    "172": "The current study was undertaken to define the role of the renin-angiotensin system in the development of hypertension in the two kidney, one clip Goldblatt rat. Captopril was administered orally (100 mg/kg/day) to two groups of rats (n = 8 each) 24 hours before and each day after unilateral renal artery clipping (0.2 mm internal diameter): the drug was given for either 16 weeks (group I) or 24 weeks (group II). Sham-operated (n = 5) and Goldblatt (n = 8) rats not receiving captopril were prepared for comparisons of plasma renin activity and systolic blood pressure. Indomethacin (20 mg/kg/day subcutaneously) was administered for 48 hours concomitantly with captopril to the rats in group I. In group II, systolic blood pressure was monitored for 7 weeks after cessation of captopril. Continual captopril administration to Goldblatt rats completely prevented the rise in systolic blood pressure, a rise that was observed in Goldblatt rats not receiving captopril. Whereas systolic blood pressure of captopril-treated rats approximated 100 mm Hg throughout the study, that of Goldblatt rats not receiving the drug increased to nearly 180 mm Hg within 6 weeks after clipping. Systolic blood pressure of sham-operated rats remained normal. Indomethacin did not change systolic blood pressure in the drug-treated rats in group I. On cessation of captopril therapy in group II, systolic blood pressure increased gradually in a manner that paralleled the development of the disease in the Goldblatt rats that did not receive captopril. Plasma renin activity was determined in Goldblatt and sham-operated rats at either 16 weeks (group I) or 24 weeks (group II) after clipping; the rats from either group with mild hypertension (systolic blood pressure less than 180 mm Hg) had normal plasma renin activity whereas those with severe hypertension (systolic blood pressure greater than 180 mm Hg) had greatly elevated plasma renin activity. In summary, captopril can completely prevent the increase in systolic blood pressure for up to 24 weeks in Goldblatt rats, and this hypotensive effect is not mediated by the prostaglandins. It is concluded that the renin-angiotensin system is a necessary component of the hypertensive process in this experimental model.", 
    "173": "In spontaneously hypertensive rats, treatment with captopril, 0.2 g/liter of drinking fluid for 12 to 24 weeks, caused a threefold increase in serum angiotensin I-converting enzyme activity. Angiotensin I-converting enzyme increased 25 to 120 percent in lung plasma membranes. The elution profile of angiotensin I-converting enzyme on DEAE cellulose and after gel filtration on Sepharose 4B was unchanged by captopril. The Km value value also remained unchanged. In Wistar rats subjected to bilateral adrenalectomy, treatment with the same dose of captopril for 3 days resulted in increased serum angiotensin I-converting enzyme activity in both sham-operated and adrenalectomized rats, but angiotensin I-converting enzyme concentration increased in lung plasma membranes from sham-operated rats and captopril-treated rats only. We conclude that captopril causes induction of angiotensin-converting enzyme biosynthesis in spontaneously hypertensive and Wistar rats. The change is a quantitative one. Intact adrenal glands may be important for the incorporation of angiotensin I-converting enzyme into lung membranes.", 
    "174": "Long-term effects of captopril on passive sodium permeability and cellular sodium concentration in the aorta of spontaneously hypertensive rats were examined in terms of contractile properties of the muscle. In cold lithium solution, cellular sodium in the aorta isolated from spontaneously hypertensive rats leaked more rapidly than did that isolated from Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY), suggesting an increased sodium permeability in the aorta of spontaneously hypertensive rats. Six weeks of treatment with captopril reduced the increased sodium permeability after hydralazine had failed. Inhibition of the sodium pump by incubating the aorta in potassium-free solution produced a slowly developing contraction which was associated with accumulation of cellular sodium. Both the magnitude of contraction and the accumulation of sodium during exposure to potassium-free solution for 1 hour were significantly less in the aorta isolated from spontaneously hypertensive rats treated with captopril compared with those from control spontaneously hypertensive rats. These data suggest that after prolonged administration, captopril alters the abnormal sodium permeability of vascular smooth muscle in spontaneously hypertensive rats and that the restoration of normal permeability reduces vascular tone.", 
    "175": "This study was designed to compare the activity of three structurally different drugs (SQ 14225 [captopril], SA 446 and MK 421) as inhibitors of angiotensin I-converting enzyme in vivo and to compare their effects on blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats and one clip, two kidney renal hypertensive rats. All the three drugs were potent, orally effective converting enzyme inhibitors. The relative durations of their actions as inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme, from longest to shortest, were as follows: MK 421, SQ 14225 and SA 446. MK 421 appears the most potent on a molar basis. In renal hypertensive rats the drugs appeared equipotent, although the duration of action of MK 421 was prolonged and SA 446 shorter than that of SQ 14225. SA 446 was less effective than the other two compounds in spontaneously hypertensive rats.", 
    "176": "Captopril was given to 15 unselected patients with essential hypertension (WHO II) at a dose range of 300 to 600 mg/day. Hemodynamic indexes (thermodilution) as well as levels of plasma norepinephrine, epinephrine, renin activity and aldosterone were determined simultaneously at the end of 2 weeks of placebo and after 8 weeks of captopril treatment. Systolic and diastolic arterial pressures were reduced significantly by treatment both supine (p less than 0.0025) and standing (p less than 0.0025). The diastolic arterial pressure was normalized (less than 95 mm Hg) in five patients and significantly reduced in four, whereas six patients were considered poor responders (mean arterial pressure decrease 10 mm Hg or less). The decrease in arterial pressure correlated significantly with the reduction in total peripheral resistance (r = 0.71), whereas cardiac index did not change and stroke index increased because of a slight decrease of heart rate. Plasma and urinary norepinephrine and epinephrine did not change during treatment. Moreover, the response of both heart rate and plasma catecholamines to upright posture was not altered by captopril treatment. Plasma renin activity increased and plasma aldosterone concentration decreased during treatment. These results suggest that inhibition of converting enzyme activity by captopril induces a reduction in arterial pressure through a reduction in total peripheral resistance. There was no evidence of an appreciable reduction in sympathetic nervous system activity during therapy.", 
    "177": "To determine whether prostaglandins contribute to the depressor response of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, plasma prostaglandin levels were measured by radioimmunoassay in normo- and hypertensive subjects on both sodium-restricted and sodium-loaded diets before and after captopril administration. On the sodium-restricted diet, the hypotensive response to captopril was accompanied by significant increments in the metabolite of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2-M) and bradykinin and by significant decrements in angiotensin II. The high sodium diet suppressed the response of the renin-angiotensin and kinin systems to captopril but the hypotensive response persisted. Furthermore, the decrease in blood pressure correlated significantly with increments in prostaglandin E2-metabolite. Prostaglandin synthesis was then inhibited in the sodium-restricted hypertensive patients by pretreatment with indomethacin. This maneuver completely eliminated the captopril-induced prostaglandin E2-metabolite increment without changing bradykinin or angiotensin II responses but significantly attenuating the hypotensive response. Finally, when patients were studied on a high sodium intake, similar effects were observed except now indomethacin completely abolished the blood pressure response to captopril. These studies therefore support the hypothesis that increased production of vasodilator prostaglandins in a major mediator of the hypotensive response to captopril. Whether the change in prostaglandin release is a direct effect of the drug or secondary to increased kinin levels is uncertain.", 
    "178": "Advances leading to recognition of the relation of the renin-angiotensin system to aldosterone include: (1) development of analytic techniques for measuring aldosterone, (2) discovery of an aldosterone-stimulating factor in circulating plasma, (3) the finding that a potent aldosterone-stimulating factor is secreted by the kidney, (4) evidence that synthetic angiotensin II increases aldosterone secretion, (5) fractionation of crude kidney extracts and the finding that aldosterone-stimulating factor is renin, (6) the observation that high plasma renin activity occurs in secondary aldosteronism, and (7) recognition that the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system occurs in congestive heart failure and in renovascular and malignant hypertension. The early use of blocking agents for the renin-angiotensin system is described along with the landmarks of progress. These include the observations that: (1) arterial pressure decreases in experimental renovascular hypertension in response to angiotensin blockade, (2) angiotensin provides important support for arterial pressure in low cardiac output states including congestive heart failure, (3) the kidney participates in this important compensatory mechanism, and (4) cellular receptors for angiotensin are present in the two inner zones of the adrenal cortex.", 
    "179": "The effects of three types of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, SQ 14225 (captopril), SQ 20881 (teprotide) and SA 446 (Santen, Osaka, Japan), on the vascular contraction induced by norepinephrine were studied in the perfused rat mesenteric vascular bed. (1) SQ 14225 attenuated in the vascular contraction induced by norepinephrine, but SQ 20881 and SA 446 revealed no effect on vascular reactivity. (2) The effect of SQ 14225 was not altered in the presence of bradykinin or angiotensin II in the perfusate. On the basis of these results it is suggested that the attenuating effect on the vascular response to norepinephrine may be limited to SQ 14225 and that its effect is not mediated through the renin-angiotensin or kallikrein-kinin system.", 
    "180": "To study the interaction of the prohypertensive renin-angiotensin axis with the antihypertensive renal prostaglandins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (captopril and teprotide) and angiotensin blockade (Sar1-Ile8-AII) were produced in rabbits in vivo and renal slice prostaglandin E2 was measured in vitro after 30 minutes of incubation in Krebs-Ringer HCO3- buffer. In rabbits with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition, de novo prostaglandin E2 synthesis decreased in cortical, outer medullary and papillary slices by 85, 52 and 47 percent, respectively. Similar degrees of inhibition were observed with angiotensin blockade. It is concluded that renal prostaglandin E2 synthesis is angiotensin II dependent under these conditions. This finding suggests that any increase in the prohypertensive antinatriuretic renin-angiotensin axis may be associated with a secondary increase in renal prostaglandin E2 which may be acting in an antihypertensive natriuretic compensatory fashion.", 
    "181": "Plasma renin activity frequently is increased in patients with congestive heart failure. This increase in inversely related to serum sodium concentration, but is not correlated with hemodynamic measurements. Nonetheless, inhibition of converting enzyme activity by administration of teprotide or captopril results in a decrease in systemic vascular resistance that is directly related to the control plasma renin activity. These data suggest that angiotensin II contributes to the systemic vasoconstriction of heart failure and that chronic inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system may have a salutary effect on left ventricular performance in patients with heart failure.", 
    "182": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, both teprotide and captopril, induce a potentiated renal vascular response in patients with essential hypertension, and with that a consistent increase in sodium excretion and occasionally an increase in glomerular filtration rate. In patients with advanced congestive heart failure resistant to other vasodilators, a similar triad occurs. It is not yet clear in which settings the renal response to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition reflects a reduction in angiotensin II formation--thus implicating the renin-angiotensin system in the pathogenesis--or an additional action, such as a potentiation of the local actions of bradykinin or enhanced prostaglandin formation. Under some circumstances, especially where a qualitatively and quantitatively similar response occurs to angiotensin antagonists and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or where an angiotensin antagonist prevents an additional response to a converting enzyme inhibitor, it is clear that the specific action of the converting enzyme inhibitor on angiotensin II formation is responsible. Unfortunately, for most responses in animal models and all responses in patients, such rigorous evidence is not yet available.", 
    "183": "Captopril is a remarkably effective new antihypertensive drug designed and developed as a potent and specific inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme, a zinc metallopeptidase that participates in the synthesis of a hypertensive peptide, angiotensin II, and in the degradation of a hypotensive peptide, bradykinin. Earlier studies with a snake venom peptide (teprotride or SQ 20881) that could be administered only by injection demonstrated that specific inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme could be highly effective as antihypertensive drugs, and helped to clarify the specificity and mechanism of action of the enzyme. A hypothetical model of the active center of angiotensin-converting enzyme based on its presumed analogy to the well characterized zinc metallopeptidase carboxypeptidase A was used to guide logical sequential improvements of a weakly active prototype inhibitor that led eventually to the highly optimized structure of captopril. The hypothetical working model of the active site of angiotensin-converting enzyme used to develop captopril continues to provide a firm basis for development of new types of specific inhibitors of this biologically important enzyme.", 
    "184": "To assess whether local tissue changes in bradykinin metabolism occur with captopril, the effect of intravenous infusion of bradykinin and captopril on bradykinin receptors in rat uterine smooth muscle was compared. Bradykinin and captopril decreased both the blood pressure and the number of bradykinin uterine receptors, estimated by direct radiolabeled binding techniques, without changing receptor affinity. These results demonstrate that bradykinin \"down-regulates\" its membrane receptor in rat myometrium. The similar change in receptor numbers induced by captopril could be explained by a local increase in bradykinin at receptor sites. The increase in local tissue level of bradykinin may contribute to the hypotensive action of captopril.", 
    "185": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme kininase II reduces bradykinin metabolism in vitro and in vivo. However, consistent changes in circulating bradykinin levels after the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril have not been reported. The kallikrein-kinin system has been suggested to be a local hormonal system concerned with regional blood flow, and hence circulating levels may not reflect local tissue levels of kinins. Anesthetized dogs given captopril had a significant increase in urinary kinin excretion without a change in circulating bradykinin levels or in urinary kallikrein. These changes in renal kinins were accompanied by a decrease in blood pressure and renal vasodilation. The hypotension and renal vasodilation produced by captopril were not attenuated either by pretreatment with the angiotension receptor antagonist Sar1-Ileu8-angiotensin II or by reduction of endogenous prostaglandin production with indomethacin. Postischemic renal vasodilation after temporary renal artery occlusion was also associated with increased urinary kinin levels. These results demonstrate that captopril effectively inhibits renal angiotensin-converting enzyme and that the renal kallikrein-kinin system may play an important role in regulating the renal vasculature and may contribute to the renal hemodynamic effects of captopril. Many polypeptide hormone membrane receptors are self-regulated by endogenous tissue concentrations of the peptide hormone. Infusions of bradykinin into rats reduced specific bradykinin receptors. A similar decrease in bradykinin receptor numbers without change in receptor affinity was demonstrated after captopril administration. These results provide indirect evidence that angiotensin-converting enzyme/kininase inhibition by captopril increases local tissue concentration of kinins, which may contribute to the hypotensive effect.", 
    "186": "126 patients with blood pressure which was unacceptably high despite a conventional stepped-care regimen (diuretic, beta-blocker, and vasodilator) took part in a comparative assessment of different approaches to the treatment of refractory hypertension. One of four regimens was used: oral diazoxide, minoxidil, captopril, or quadruple therapy (diuretic + beta-adrenoceptor blocker + hydralazine + prazosin). Despite the severity of hypertension, blood pressure could be controlled in almost all these patients, and no patient died from cerebrovascular disease while on treatment. 2 patients died of renal failure and 5 patients required long-term haemodialysis. Ischaemic heart disease remained a problem and caused the death of 10 patients. Diazoxide was the most effective treatment but was the most difficult and unpleasant to use. Captopril was the best-tolerated but failed to control blood pressure in 6 of 15 patients. Our experience indicates that there are now sufficient therapeutic alternatives to achieve acceptable blood-pressure control in almost all patients with \"refractory\" hypertension, although no treatment is ideal.", 
    "187": "MK 421, at the dose of 25 mg/kg, administered daily by gavage to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) from their 4th to 15th weeks of age almost completely inhibited development of genetic hypertension. Since heart rate and cardiac and systolic indexes were not affected by the drug, prevention of genetic hypertension development was solely related to an early, potent and long-lasting reduction of the progressive increase of the peripheral resistance which generally develops in SHRs during ageing. MK 421 reduced body growth but did not modify fluid intake, plasma NA+ and urine volume, thus water and salt retention did not develop. MK 421 enhanced vascular responsiveness to norepinephrine and angiotension II and reduced myocardial hypertrophy. Plasma renin concentration was increased and urinary antidiuretic hormone did not change. Finally, MK 421's preventive effects against genetic hypertension development persisted up to 10 weeks after discontinuation of treatment.", 
    "188": "A centrifugal gel filtration separation of serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) from a potent stable inhibitor is described. This, together with a 20 hr assay incubation of very dilute enzyme, permitted the assessment of the effects of enalapril maleate treatment on total serum ACE in rats and dogs. Total serum ACE increased in both species after 1 or 2 weeks at 10 mg/kg/day. Serum ACE in rats was more than doubled; whereas the increase was modest in dogs (48 +/- 9% minimum). The effect of the drug on serum ACE combined with inherent variability of ACE precluded use of serum ACE activity as an accurate measure of inhibitor concentration in animals receiving enalapril maleate.", 
    "189": "The effects of the converting enzyme (CE) inhibitor, captopril, on blood pressure, plasma aldosterone, plasma renin activity (PRA), and kidney morphology were studied. Captopril, at a near maximum daily recommended human dose of approximately 5.0 mg/kg, was administered to rabbits over a period of six months. Mean arterial pressure, CE activity, and aldosterone levels were significantly reduced; PRA and renal renin activity were increased. Microscopic examination of the kidney showed marked hyperplasia of the juxtaglomerular apparatus in all of the treated animals.", 
    "190": "The biological activity of des-asp1-des-arg2-angiotensin II (3-8AII) was studied in man. When 3-8AII was infused iv at rates of 22 and 308 pmol (17.5 and 250 ng)/kg . min separately into 5 normal men each for 120 min, blood pressure showed no change, plasma renin activity (PRA) decreased gradually and plasma aldosterone showed a gradual slight increase. The lower dose of 3-8AII partially inhibited captopril-induced PRA increase and plasma aldosterone decrease in the same 5 normal men and the higher dose of the hexapeptide completely abolished them. In one of the 5 normal men blood pressure rose in response to doses of 3-8AII greater than 2220 pmol (1750 ng)/kg . min. When 3-8AII was infused iv at 308 pmol/kg . min into 2 patients with Bartter's syndrome for 60 min, it caused marked decrease in PRA and plasma aldosterone but no change in blood pressure. This decrease in plasma aldosterone is thought to be secondary to the decrease in PRA. From these results it is evident that 3-8AII has a minimal pressor action, a weak aldosterone-stimulating action and a significant renin-suppressing action in man and this PRA-lowering action is thought to be due to direct inhibition of renin release by its whole molecule or a smaller part of the molecule.", 
    "191": "The hemodynamic mechanism by which patients with chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) maintain their blood pressure (BP) in the upright posture is distinct from that of normal and hypertensive individuals. There are little data regarding the effects of chronic vasodilator therapy on the mechanisms controlling this response, especially in the presence of diuretic therapy. Therefore, 10 consecutive patients with severe chronic CHF underwent hemodynamic tilt study following acute and chronic captopril therapy. One patient developed orthostatic hypotension following first-dose captopril, but 6 of 10 had a mean BP decrease of 70 +/- 6 to 56 +/- 3 mm Hg on tilt following chronic captopril. This associated with significant reduction of plasma aldosterone, and was abolished on re-tilt following acute saline infusion. Therefore, during chronic captopril therapy of CHF, a reduction of diuretic dosage may be necessary to prevent orthostatic hypotension.", 
    "192": "Little is known about changes in inactive plasma renin in various conditions or the in vivo activation mechanism of inactive renin. The effects of various factors known to stimulate or suppress renin release on active and inactive PRA were examined in normal subjects. Inactive PRA was determined as the difference between the total PRA after trypsin activation and active PRA. Concurrent measurements of urinary kallikrein excretion and plasma prekallikrein activity were performed to assess the possible role of renal or plasma kallikrein in in vivo activation of inactive renin. Short term stimulation with iv furosemide and ambulation, infusion of isoproterenol, and administration of captopril increased active PRA, but had little or no effect on inactive PRA. Sodium restriction and sodium loading, each for 4 days, induced parallel changes in active and inactive PRA. The administration of propranolol for 4 days decreased active PRA but did not change inactive PRA. There were no significant correlations between the changes in urinary kallikrein excretion and those in active PRA or in the proportion of active to total PRA after any short term treatments, except furosemide administration. Plasma prekallikrein activity was correlated with the proportion of active renin only during the long term sodium balance study. The present data suggest that the mechanisms ofr the control of inactive and active renin are different. Neither renal nor plasma kallikrein seems to be consistently involved in the in vivo activation of inactive renin.", 
    "193": "Captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor with antihypertensive properties, was given by mouth and intravenously in 10-mg doses to five healthy subjects. After intravenous dosing, semilogarithmic plots of captopril blood levels : time showed a triexponential decay. Data were analyzed using an open three-compartment model. The average volume of distribution (Vd) was 0.2 l/kg for the central compartment and 2 l/kg for the elimination (beta) phase. The Vd at steady-state was 0.7 l/kg. The total body clearance of captopril averaged 0.8 l/kg/hr and the mean blood half-life during the beta phase was 1.9 hr. In the 0- to 96-hr urine, after intravenous and oral drug, excretion of radioactivity accounted for 87% and 61% of dose. In the 0- to 24-hr urine, averages of 38% (intravenous) and 24% (oral) of the doses were excreted as unchanged captopril. Absolute absorption of the radioactive oral dose was 71% and the absolute oral bioavailability of captopril was 62%.", 
    "194": "The 6-month extended vasodilator efficacy of the oral angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, captopril (CPT), was evaluated by sequential cardiac catheterization, nuclear scintigraphy, echocardiography, treadmill exercise, and symptomatology in nine patients with severe chronic left ventricular (LV) failure (CHF). CPT lowered LV filling pressure (from 23 to 14 mm Hg acutely (p less than 0.001) and to 14 mm Hg (p less than 0.01) with continuous 6-month therapy; concomitantly CPT raised cardiac index from 2.03 to 2.46 L/min/m2 initially (p less than 0.02) and to 2.33 L/min/m2 (p less than 0.02) at 6 months. Simultaneously CPT raised LV ejection fraction from 0.21 to 0.25 acutely (p less than 0.01) and to 0.30 (p less than 0.001) and to 60 mm (p less than 0.001) at 6 months. These beneficial actions of CPT on LV pump function raised treadmill exercise duration (from 339 to 426 seconds initially (p less than 0.05) and to 499 seconds (p less than 0.05) at 6 months, while considerably reducing CHF symptomatology (p less than 0.001). Thus ACE inhibition by CPT provides markedly beneficial sustained hemodynamic and clinical improvement in advanced LV failure without fluid accumulation or late vasodilator drug tolerance.", 
    "195": "Several phosphonamides, phosphoramides, and phosphates having the general structure R-Y-P(O)(OH)-X-CH(CH3)-CO-Pro have been synthesized and tested for inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; peptidyl-dipeptide hydrolase, EC 3.4.15.1). Inhibition was found to depend on the nature of R, Y, and X such that the maximal effect was observed when X = NH, Y = CH2, and R = phi CH2 (50% inhibition at 7 nM). Substitution of CH2 or O at X and O at Y produced significantly less potent inhibitors. Groups shorter or longer than R = phi CH2 led to less active inhibitors, presumably due to nonoptimal interaction of the side chain with the S1 subsite.", 
    "196": "Seven of 23 hypertensive patients treated with captopril (SQ 14,225), an orally active converting enzyme inhibitor, developed a pruritic, erythematous, macular, and papular eruption of the trunk, face, and proximal extremities. The eruption appeared one to 31 weeks after initiation of captopril therapy and was associated with diarrhea (three patients), fever (two patients), and generalized arthralgias (one patient). Six patients had an increased percentage of band cells (5 to 34 per cent) on peripheral smear without an associated leukocytosis. In one patient, the skin rash was associated with a peripheral eosinophilia (20 per cent). Coombs-positive hemolytic anemia, and acute renal failure with eosinophiluria. There were no changes in BUN, creatinine, or urinalyses in the remaining patients. Four patients showed a transient rise in plasma PGE without concomitant changes in plasma PFG2 alpha or 6-keto PGF1 alpha, and three patients had slight elevations in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Skin biopsies revealed a perivascular and perifollicular lymphocytic and histiocytic infiltrate with negative immunofluorescence to IgG, IgM, IgA, and beta 1 C. The skin eruption and associated symptoms resolved in all patients, even though captopril administration was continued in six of the seven patients.", 
    "197": "Antibodies raised against mouse submaxillary renin showed affinity for rat renal renin. The affinity was characterized by enzyme kinetics in vitro. The antibodies and the purified Fab fragments showed total inhibition of rat renin, with a Ki of 6.5 +/- 0.7 x 10(-8)mol/l for the Fab fragments. The effect of enzymatic inhibition on blood pressure in anaesthetized rats was compared with converting enzyme inhibition. The antibodies showed a significant effect on blood pressure, with a depressor effect corresponding to that of the converting enzyme inhibitor [SQ 20 881]. The reduction of mean arterial pressure was from 116 +/- 3 to 108 +/- 3 mmHg for the antibodies and to 107 +/- 4 mmHg for the converting enzyme inhibitor. The pressor response of infused rat renal renin was totally blocked by the antibodies while pressor responses of angiotensin II were unchanged.", 
    "198": "The converting enzyme inhibitors (CEI) SA446 and Captopril (CAP) were given orally at a dose of 50 mg/kg per day to adult stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) over a period of four weeks. Both CEI lowered arterial blood pressure (BP) to a similar extent. CAP was more inhibitory on the plasma renin-angiotensin system (RAS) than SA446. Both CEI lowered urinary aldosterone excretion but had little (SA446) or no (CAP) natriuretic effect. CAP reduced the pressor responses to intravenous (i.v.) angiotensin I (ANG I) more (52%) than SA446 (18%) and potentiated the depressor responses to i.v. bradykinin more (fortyfold) than SA446 (tenfold). In contrast, SA446 treatment reduced the pressor responses to intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) ANG I by 21% and led to a rise in the hypothalamic renin concentration. Oral CAP treatment for four weeks did not produce these signs of a brain converting enzyme inhibition. It is concluded that SA446 is equally as antihypertensive as CAP in SHRSP. SA446 appears to penetrate more readily into the brain and to exert its action partly through inhibition of the brain RAS which is known to be stimulated in SHRSP.", 
    "199": "The dipsogenic and the pressor effect following intracerebroventricular injection of angiotensins and several C-terminal fragments were studied. Angiotensin I (ANG I), ANG II, ANG III and C-terminal hexa-, penta, tetra- and tripeptide stimulated water intake in water-replete rats and induced significant pressor responses. In both paradigms the most active peptides (in the pmol range) were ANG II, ANG I and ANG III, in that order. Shorter C-terminal peptides appeared to be active, but had to be injected in the nmol range. Latencies to the onset of drinking were less than 45 s for all peptides tested. The C-terminal dipeptide and other dipeptide fragments did not possess detectable dipsogenic activity. The dipsogenic effect of ANG I was inhibited by pretreatment of animals with the converting enzyme inhibitor SQ 14,225. Drinking induced by both ANG I and ANG (4-8) was antagonized by the ANG II-receptor blocking agent Sar1-Ala8-ANG II. It is concluded that conversion of ANG I into ANG II is a prerequisite for the expression of the observed biological activity in the brain. Short C-terminal fragments are capable of stimulating the ANG II receptors, but a peptide chain of 7 amino acids appears necessary for maximal agonistic activity.", 
    "200": "Captopril in vitro (50-500 micrograms/ml) increased 3H-TdR incorporation in unstimulated and mitogen-stimulated cultures of rat lymphocytes. Unseparated spleen and lymph node cells of rats orally treated with captopril (50 mg/kg/day x 4)) showed decreased basal and mitogen stimulated 3H-TdR incorporation. The removal of macrophages abrogated this inhibitory effect. Leucine aminopeptidase activity of macrophages was reduced - in vivo and in vitro - by captopril.", 
    "201": "Twenty-four patients with moderate to severe hypertension were treated for four weeks with captopril, an oral inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme. The fall in blood pressure with captopril alone correlated with pretreatment plasma renin activity. The effect of adding either hydrochlorothiazide or propranolol to the captopril treatment was then studied. The addition of hydrochlorothiazide to captopril produced a dose-dependent fall in blood pressure. At the higher dose of the diuretic this fall in blood pressure correlated with weight loss, suggesting that when the diuretic-induced compensatory rise in angiotensin II is prevented by captopril the fall in blood pressure becomes dependent on loss of sodium and water. In contrast, the addition of propranolol to captopril produced no further fall in blood pressure, suggesting that inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme prevents the blood pressure lowering effect of propranolol. This may have implications for the mechanism whereby beta-blockers alone lower blood pressure. These contrasting effects of hydrochlorothiazide and propranolol in the presence of captopril indicate that in patients whose hypertension is not controlled by captopril alone the addition of increasing doses of diuretic is likely to control the blood pressure. The addition of a beta-blocker, however, is less likely to be effective.", 
    "202": "The angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitor captopril was used as long-term preoperative treatment in a series of hypertensive patients with unilateral renal arterial disease. There were immediate and sustained falls in plasma angiotensin II and aldosterone concentrations, with converse increases in circulating renin and angiotensin I. In patients with sodium and potassium deficiency and secondary aldosterone excess before treatment captopril corrected the sodium and potassium deficits; in these cases the initial hypotensive response was profound but the later effect was less pronounced. When sodium and potassium state was initially normal it remained unchanged during captopril treatment, while the full hypotensive effect took up to three weeks to be attained. The immediate, but not long-term, falls in arterial pressure with captopril were proportional to the immediate decrements of plasma angiotensin II. Nevertheless, while the immediate blood-pressure reduction with captopril variously overestimated and underestimated the eventual surgical response, the absolute blood-pressure values during long-term captopril related well with those after operation. Pretreatment plasma renin and angiotensin II concentrations, while closely predicting the immediate captopril response, are fallible guides to surgical prognosis. In contrast, long-term treatment with converting-enzyme inhibitors may provide an accurate indication of surgical outcome.", 
    "203": "An angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitory, captopril (or SQ 14225), was administered orally to 23 hypertensive patients under a constant sodium and potassium diet. It resulted in reduction of plasma aldosterone concentration which was related significantly to the increase of serum potassium level (r = -0.533), but only weakly to the reduction of plasma angiotensin II level (r = 0.474). Aldosterone level remained suppressed in the face of increased serum potassium. The effects on aldosterone level and potassium were greater in patients with high plasma renin activity than in those with low and normal plasma renin activities. They also paralleled the reduction in blood pressure. It is suggested that reduction in aldosterone level and potassium retention were caused by blockade of angiotensin II formation by captopril, but the potassium retention was additionally influenced by renal impairment.", 
    "204": "The effects of a single dose of 50 mg of SQ 14225 (Captopril) and 0.6 microgram/kg/min infusion of angiotensin II antagonist, [Sar1, Ileu8] (AII-A), were examined in six patients with dialysis resistant hypertension and seven with normal blood pressures. A depressor effect of Captopril was observed even in patients with AII-A unresponsive dialysis resistant hypertension. The fall in mean arterial pressure (MAP) was significantly correlated with the fall in the total peripheral resistance index (TPRI) following both Captopril administration (r = 0.883, P less than 0.01) and AII-A infusion (r = 0.735, P less than 0.01). Basal plasma renin activity (PRA) was the same in patients with dialysis resistant hypertension as in normotensive patients and correlated with the fall in MAP induced by AII-A infusion (r = -0.640, P less than 0.05). It was concluded that the direct effect of the renin-angiotensin system was uncertain in patients with dialysis resistant hypertension and that the depressor effect of Captopril was not secondary to the suppression of angiotensin II formation.", 
    "205": "Captopril, an orally active dipeptidylcarboxypeptidase inhibitor, is a promising new antihypertensive agent. Cutaneous reactions, including (rarely) a pityriasis rosea-like eruption, are frequently associated with this therapy. Two new cases of a pityriasis rosea-like captopril-induced eruption support a pharmacologic mechanism for the eruption, since it resolved after the dosage of captopril was lowered in one patient and continued when the dosage of captopril remained unchanged in the other patient. However, the eruption later responded to therapy while use of the drug was continued. Captopril should be included among those drugs associated with a pityriasis rosea-like eruption.", 
    "206": "In 15 patients with chronic left ventricular failure caused by ischaemic heart disease, cardiac output and right heart pressures were measured before and after the oral angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, which was administered in increasing doses. In 12 of 15 patients, coronary blood flow, and in 11 patients myocardial oxygen extraction and consumption and lactate extraction were also determined before and after captopril therapy. Cardiac index and stroke volume index increased by an average of 25% and 27%, respectively. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure also decreased in all patients (average 27%), suggesting improved left ventricular function. The rate-pressure product, coronary blood flow, and myocardial oxygen consumption decreased significantly; in one of 11 patients there was myocardial lactate production, despite decreased myocardial oxygen demand and consumption. These findings suggest that in patients with chronic heart failure, improved left ventricular function with captopril is generally associated with decreased metabolic cost and that deterioration of metabolic function occurs infrequently.", 
    "207": "Malignant hypertension, which developed in a 9-year-old boy after an episode of haemolytic uraemic syndrome, could not be controlled with antihypertensive agents. However, treatment with oral converting enzyme inhibitor (captopril) was effective in controlling the blood pressure and it averted bilateral nephrectomy. No adverse effects from the drug were noted.", 
    "208": "A series of mercaptoacyl amino acids and related compounds was synthesized and evaluated for inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in order to determine the nature and importance of the putative interaction between ACE and the amide moiety of inhibitors such as captopril (3-mercapto-2-methylpropanoyl-L-proline). It was concluded that the interaction involves a hydrogen bond from a donor site on ACE to the oxygen of the amide carbonyl. Compounds in which the amide moiety is replaced by other groups (ester, ketone, sulfonamide) capable of accepting a hydrogen bond are effective inhibitors, but compounds in which only the geometrical features of the amide are retained are ineffective inhibitors. The presence of an NH group is not necessary for effective inhibition. The activity of a series of mercaptoacyl cycloalkyl carboxylic acids parallels the activity of the isosteric series of mercaptoacyl imino acids.", 
    "209": "The present study assessed the contribution of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), dietary sodium, and cardiac output (CO) to the genesis of primate hypertensin in a one-kidney model which was developed to test species-specific renin inhibitors. Reduction of renal perfusion pressure increased mean arterial pressure (MAP) from 105 +/- 4 to 127 +/- 3 mm Hg (p less than 0.0005), associated with increased plasma renin activity (PRA) from 4.9 +/- 0.7 to 13.8 +/- 1.1 ng. ml-1.hr-1 (p less than 0.0005). Correlation of MAP with PRA yielded an r value of 0.662 (p less than 0.0005). Significant blood pressure elevation was obtained with both regular (R) and low sodium (LS) diet (p less than 0.0005), although the MAP change was greater with LS. With both R and LS diet, hypertension was associated with increased PRA (p less than 0.0005), and normotensive pressures were achieved with converting enzyme inhibitor (teprotide). The hemodynamic change with hypertension was an increase of systemic vascular resistance (SVR) from 0.89 +/- 0.12 to 1.17 +/- 0.09 units (p less than 0.05); cardiac output (CO) and central blood volume did not change significantly. Thus, acute hypertension, mediated by the RAS, was developed in a one-kidney primate model. The hemodynamic correlate of hypertension was increased SVR; CO and volume redistribution were not initiating factors.", 
    "210": "Twelve scleroderma patients with hypertension, seven of whom had malignant hypertension and renal failure of scleroderma renal crisis, were treated with captopril. The first dose lowered mean pressure in all patients by 21.3 mmHg; in 6 patients it relieved encephalopathy. Blood pressure was controlled in all patients. Two of 7 patients with scleroderma renal crisis had improvement in renal function; the 5 patients who did not have malignant hypertension improved or stabilized. Despite good pressure control, however, renal failure developed in 5 patients with scleroderma renal crisis. The data indicated that captopril is effective antihypertensive therapy in scleroderma and, when given early, may prevent renal failure and death.", 
    "211": "The blood pressure (BP) lowering effect of the orally active angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril (SQ14225), was studied in 59 hypertensive patients maintained on a constant sodium intake. Within 2 hours of the first dose of captopril BP fell from 171/107 to a maximum low of 142/92 mm Hg (p less than 0.001), and after 4 to 8 days to treatment BP averaged 145/94 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). The magnitude of BP drop induced by captopril was significantly correlated to baseline plasma renin activity (PRA) both during the acute phase (r = -0.38, p less than 0.01) and after the 4 to 8-day interval (r = -0.33, p less than 0.01). Because of considerable scatter in individual data, renin profiling was not precisely predictive of the immediate or delayed BP response of separate patients. However, the BP levels achieved following the initial dose of captopril were closely correlated to BP measured after 4 to 8 days of therapy, and appeared to have greater predictive value than control PRA of the long-term efficacy of chronic captopril therapy despite marked BP changes occurring in some patients during the intermediate period. Because of these intermediate BP changes, addition of a diuretic to enhance antihypertensive effectiveness of angiotensin blockade should be restrained for several days after initiation of captopril therapy.", 
    "212": "The effects of the converting enzyme inhibitor, SQ 14,225, on the renin-angiotensin system, adrenal function and blood pressure were investigated in 14 hypertensive patients, i.e., 10 with essential hypertension (EH) and 4 with renovascular hypertension (RVH). The mean blood pressure (MBP) and plasma aldosterone showed significant decreases in the EH with normal renin (NR) group and in the RVH group but no significant changes in the EH with low renin (LR) group. Plasma renin activity (PRA) increased significantly in the EH and NR group and in the RVH group but showed no significant change in the EH with LR group. Significant correlations were found between the fall in MBP after SQ 14,225 treatment and the pretreatment levels of PRA or plasma aldosterone. In an ACTH infusion study, the response of plasma aldosterone to ACTH revealed significant decreases after SQ 14,225 administration. In an angiotensin II (A II) infusion study, the response of plasma aldosterone was unchanged after SQ 14,225 administration. However, the pressor responses to A II infusion with SQ 14,225 were significantly higher than those without SQ 14,225. From these findings, it is concluded that the antihypertensive mechanism of SQ 14,225 may be due mainly to the decrease in levels of endogenous A II and that the reduction in plasma aldosterone after SQ 14,225 were significantly higher than those without SQ 14,225. From these findings, it is concluded that the antihypertensive mechanism of SQ 14,225 administration may be due to reduction of endogenous A II levels by converting enzyme inhibition.", 
    "213": "Lung lavage levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-like activity were increased in C57BL/6 mice with Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG)-induced chronic granulomatous pulmonary inflammation and splenomegaly. Contrariwise, ACE activity was not increased in lung lavage fluids of CBA mice that developed only minimal pulmonary inflammation in response to BCG. ACE-like activity correlated with the intensity of inflammation and Captopril, a specific competitive inhibitor of ACE activity, markedly suppressed the induction and maintenance of the BCG-induced inflammatory response in both lungs and spleen. It was necessary, however, to provide sustained treatment with large doses of Captopril in order to reduce the inflammatory response. After a single intraperitoneal injection of Captopril, ACE levels in lung lavage of BCG-injected mice were reduced but returned to preinjection levels or greater within 24 h. The highest dose of Captopril was more effective in reducing the lung fluid level of ACE in BCG-inflamed lungs. This suggests that sustained daily injections of Captopril were necessary to maintain reduced ACE levels. In vitro studies indicated that high concentrations of Captopril did not affect macrophage mobility or chemotactic activity for macrophages. Thus, ACE may act as a molecular mediator of BCG-induced granulomatous inflammation in the lung.", 
    "214": "The humoral and hemodynamic effects of converting enzyme inhibition captopril are presented in two patients with primary hyperaldosteronism (PHA). In all, 20 patients with resistant hypertension were treated with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril. In 18 patients with essential or renovascular hypertension mean (+/- SEM) plasma renin activity (PRA) rose from 5.0 +/- 1.4 to 35.3 +/- 5.3 ng/ml/hr (P less than 0.01) and mean (+/- SEM) plasma aldosterone (PA) declined from 25.8 +/- 2.9 to 15.1 +/- 1.9 ng/ml (P less than 0.01) after captopril. In two patients with PHA the PRA was not stimulated by converting enzyme inhibition, although there was modest decline in PA and a temporary reduction in blood pressure. After surgical removal of aldosterone-producing adenomas, PRA responsed appropriately to captopril. These cases illustrate that a disease process can modify the response to a drug and demonstrate that, in patients with PHA, captopril does not stimulate PRA, induces only minor decrements in PA, and is relatively ineffective as an antihypertensive.", 
    "215": "Angiotensin -converting enzyme (ACE) activity was found to be present within the rat aorta using radioenzymatic techniques. Forty-two percent of the enzyme activity was localized within the tunica media. Using an equilibrium dialysis cell system that insured equal free captopril concentrations in both plasma and aorta, converting enzyme in both tissues was observed to possess similar dissociation constants for the inhibitor. Four daily intraperitoneal doses, but not a single dose, of captopril led to a persistent inhibition of aortic-converting enzyme 24 h after final drug administration. Plasma-converting enzyme activity was changed at this time. These results suggest that different pools of converting enzyme recover form captopril inhibition at different rates. The prolonged inhibition of aortic ACE is discussed in terms of drug accumulation within the vessel wall, and the effect of such accumulation on the persistent antihypertensive actions of captopril are also discussed.", 
    "216": "Rabbit brain endo-oligopeptidase B inactivates angiotensin I (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe-His-Leu) and angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) by hydrolysis of the Pro7-Phe8 peptide bond. The site of hydrolysis was determined in preparative and analytical experiments in which both products were recovered in a molar ratio of 1:1, and the sum of the products plus unhydrolyzed substrate accounted for the starting material. The enzyme has a Km of 6.3 x 10(-5) M for angiotensin II at pH 8.3 and is activated 30-fold with 4.8 mM dithiothreitol. BPP9a ( less than Gln-Trp-Pro-Arg-Pro-Gln-Ile-Pro-Pro, SQ 20,881) inhibits the inactivation of angiotensin II with an I50 of 5 x 10(-5) M. BPP5a (less than Gln-Lys-Trp-Ala-Pro, SQ 20,475) is less active and D-3-mercapto-2-methylpropanoyl-L-proline (captopril, SQ 14,225) has essentially no activity. These endo-oligopeptidase B in angiotensin I and II metabolism remains to be established.", 
    "217": "1 The renal haemodynamic responses to a close arterial infusion of noradrenaline (29.7-177.9 nmol kg-1 h-1) were measured in rats anaesthetized with pentobarbitone. Systemic blood pressure was unaffected by noradrenaline infusion at this dose level. Renal blood flow was significantly reduced by 16% while glomerular filtration rate remained unchanged. These responses resulted in a rise in filtration fraction of some 10%. 2 In a separate group of animals, noradrenaline infusion in this manner and at similar dose rate increased plasma renin activity approximately 3 fold. 3 Continuous infusion of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, teprotide (3.36 mumol kg-1 h-1), had no measurable effect on systemic blood pressure, renal blood flow, glomerular filtration rate or filtration fraction. 4 Infusion of noradrenaline into these animals receiving teprotide caused a significant fall in renal blood flow of 16%. There was a fall in glomerular filtration rate of some 17% which was significantly different from the response observed in the animals not receiving teprotide. There was a consequent small but insignificant fall in filtration fraction. 5 These data show that the regulation of glomerular filtration rate in response to the vasoconstrictor drug, noradrenaline, is partly mediated via the renin-angiotensin system. They provide evidence for a role of intrarenal angiotensin II in regulating glomerular filtration by causing efferent arteriolar vasoconstriction.", 
    "218": "We have utilized several inhibitors to assess the effects of kininases on the contractile activity of bradykinin (BK), kallidin (KD), des-Arg9-BK and des-Arg10-KD on two isolated blood vessels, the rabbit aorta and mesenteric vein. The response of the two vessels to kinins are mediated by B1-receptors, implying that fragments of kinins without the C-terminal arginine are much more active on these tissues than the whole kinin sequences. Blockers of carboxypeptidase B-like enzymes, such as SQ24798 and pivalyl-L-arginine decrease the apparent affinity of BK and KD on the two vessels, while not changing those of des-Arg9-BK and des-Arg10-KD; this suggests that a major part of the contractile activities of BK and KD are mediated by des-Arg metabolites formed in situ at the tissue level by a kininase I. The block of kininase II by captopril or desacetylated MK-421 bring about a complex pattern of activity changes that include the potentiation of BK and KD and the depression of des-Arg10-KD. These results, in conjunction with those obtained with the non-specific inhibitors of metallopeptidases, thioglycolic acid and EDTA, suggest that the relative contribution of kininase I and kininase II to the degradation of kinins in arterial and venous vessels may be different. The implications of these findings on the pharmacology of B1-receptors are discussed.", 
    "219": "A new method for quantitation of captopril in human blood is described. Captopril was derivatized with N-(4-dimethylaminophenyl)maleimide into the electrochemically active adduct. The derivative was separated and determined by high-performance liquid chromatography with an electrochemical detector on a reversed-phase column. The proposed method was satisfactory for determination of captopril in whole blood with respect to accuracy and precision. The detection limit of captopril thereby obtained was 10 ng/ml. The blood levels of captopril in patients orally given an official dose were measured by the present method.", 
    "220": "1. An inhibitor of angiotensin-I-converting enzyme activity (D-3-mercapto-2-methylpropanoyl-L-proline, Captopril) was given to five chronically cannulated pregnant ewes and eleven rabbits in late pregnancy. 2. Within 2 min of administration to the sheep, Captopril had blocked the maternal conversion of angiotensin I to II, as assessed by the pressor response evoked by the i.v. administration of angiotensin I. Maternal and fetal basal systemic blood pressures had fallen within 10 min of administration. Although maternal systemic blood pressure returned to basal levels within 2 hr, fetal pressures remained low for up to 2 days. 3. All ewes went into spontaneous labour at or near term. One lamb was live-born but very weak and failed to establish suckling. The remaining seven lambs were fresh still-births. 4. Gestation length was significantly prolonged in the treated rabbits by comparison with ten controls. The still-birth rate was 37% in the treated animals and 6% in the controls (P less than 0.001). 5. It is concluded that the administration of Captopril to the two species studied is harmful to the fetus. The observations suggest that the drug rapidly crosses the placenta, and may cross the blood-brain barrier to exert a central effect. It may also interfere with the normal initiation of parturition.", 
    "221": "14C-Captopril was administered as 100-mg tablets to 12 subjects in a two-way crossover study in which subjects were either fasted or were given a standard meal immediately prior to dosing. Based on blood level and urinary excretion data, both the absorption of total radioactivity and the bioavailability of captopril were decreased approximately 35 to 40 per cent after a meal. Whether this moderate decrease in the absorption and the bioavailability of captopril caused by food is of clinical significance has not yet been determined.", 
    "222": "The factors that might activate the renin-angiotensin system in treated heart failure were explored. Serum Na+ correlated inversely with plasma renin activity. The degree of congestive heart failure measured by right atrial pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, cardiac index, and systemic vascular resistance did not correlate with plasma renin activity. Similarly, renal function as measured by blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and urinary Na+ excretion did not correlate with plasma renin activity. In a prospectively screened group, seven patients with congestive heart failure who were found to be hyponatraemic had plasma renin activities greater than 15 ng/ml per h. Serial determinations in one patient showed plasma renin activity to vary inversely with the serum Na+. It is concluded that serum sodium can be used to identify those patients with congestive heart failure who have a high plasma renin activity. The value of identifying these high renin heart failure patients was seen in their response in four cases to specific therapy with a converting enzyme inhibitor.", 
    "223": "1. The role of prostaglandins and angiotensin II in blood flow regulation was studied in conscious rabbits subjected to mild haemorrhage. 2. Haemorrhage caused a 13% fall in arterial pressure and a 21% fall in cardiac output, responses which were unchanged by sodium meclofenamate, an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, or captopril, an inhibitor of the angiotensin converting enzyme. 3. Haemorrhage doubled plasma adrenaline and noradrenaline levels. Plasma renin activity trebled after haemorrhage and was further elevated by captopril. 4. Renal blood flow was maintained after haemorrhage alone. Meclofenamate given immediately after haemorrhage caused a 31% fall in renal blood flow. Captopril given immediately after haemorrhage caused renal vasodilation, but when given after meclofenamate augmented renal vasoconstriction. 5. Splenic vasoconstriction was seen after haemorrhage and meclofenamate, and subsequently was augmented by captopril. 6. Results suggest that prostaglandins variably modulate regional blood flow in conscious rabbits subjected to mild haemorrhage. Enhanced sympatho-adrenal activity increases renovascular and splenic dependence on vasodilator prostaglandins, but not that of coronary, cerebral, hepatic or adrenal circulations. Renal and splenic vasoconstriction seen with meclofenamate are not due to circulating angiotensin II.", 
    "224": "1 The effects of the orally active angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, were examined in 15 patients with mild or moderate essential hypertension. 2 Following initial dosing with captopril 25 mg, there was a significant fall in supine and erect blood pressure in 2 h and lasting for 6 h. There was no significant alteration of heart rate. No reduction was seen in plasma noradrenaline concentration. Maximum inhibition of plasma converting enzyme activity occurred 60 min post-dosing. 3 There was a strong positive correlation between blood pressure reduction and converting enzyme inhibition. The magnitude of the blood pressure reduction and converting enzyme inhibition following initial dosing was reflected in subsequent success with captopril monotherapy during a 12 week follow-up period. 4 It was also found that patients who did not achieve adequate blood pressure control on captopril in doses of 50 mg three times daily or less still were not controlled on a dose of 150 mg three times daily without the addition of a diuretic. 5 The risks of renal and marrow toxicity from captopril may be reduced by administering only low doses with the addition, where necessary, of a thiazide diuretic.", 
    "225": "To examine the role of the renin-angiotensin system in aminoglycoside-induced acute renal failure, we gave rats gentamicin (80 mg/kg/day), gentamicin + captopril (an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor), captopril alone or saline sham injections, for 10 days. Blood pressure, sodium excretion, urine osmolality and creatinine clearance were measured four times during treatment. Plasma renin activity, angiotensin I-converting enzyme and renal histology were determined at sacrifice. Although angiotensin I-converting enzyme activity was markedly suppressed by captopril treatment, the addition of captopril failed to consistently influence blood pressure or urine osmolality. In addition, it did not promote natriuresis in the face of gentamicin toxicity. Creatinine clearance decreased progressively in groups receiving gentamicin and was lowest (P less than .05) in the groups receiving gentamicin + captopril. Captopril did not prevent the development of tubular epithelial nor glomerular endothelial changes associated with gentamicin toxicity. In a separate experiment rats received captopril for 3 days prior, before receiving the gentamicin + captopril regimen for 10 days. Captopril pretreatment did not influence the results. This study does not support a pivotal role for the renin-angiotensin system in the production of the decreased glomerular filtration rate observed in nephrotoxic acute renal failure induced by gentamicin in rats.", 
    "226": "Captopril (Lopirin, Squibb, von Heyden) is an inhibitor of the angiotensin-I converting enzyme. In congestive heart failure angiotensin mediated vasoconstriction and aldosterone secretion is reversed by captopril. Both effects of captopril induce reduction of cardiac preload and afterload. The clinical state of patients with congestive heart failure therefore improves since cardiac output increased and pulmonary pressures decrease. Captopril acts orally and the dosage used for the treatment of congestive heart failure ranges from 50 to 150 mg daily. After oral ingestion of a single dose the maximum haemodynamic effect is observed after 45-90 min. No tolerance induction or tachyphylaxis has been observed during maintenance therapy over a period of 18 months. There are some reversible adverse reactions like pruritus, skin rash and partial or complete taste loss which are dose related. Serious side effects include leucopenia, agranulocytosis, renal failure and membranous glomerulonephritis. Therefore regular urinary and blood analysis is necessary during captopril therapy.", 
    "227": "Bovine lung angiotensin I-converting enzyme is rapidly and irreversibly inactivated by p-[N,N-bis(chloroethyl)amino]phenylbutyric acid (chlorambucil) and by the chlorambucil derivative of L-proline (chlorambucyl-proline). Chlorambucil is a nitrogen mustard alkylating agent that is used as an antineoplastic drug. At any one concentration, the inactivation is pseudo-first order with time. Inhibition by both substances is active site directed as suggested by the formation of a reversible enzyme-inhibitor complex prior to the alkylation reaction and by the fact that L-Phe-L-Pro, a reversible inhibitor which is competitive with substrate, is also competitive with both irreversible inhibitors in protecting the enzyme against inactivation. The second order rate constant for inactivation increases in the pH range 5-8 and reaches a value of 3.5 X 10(3) M-1 . min-1 for chlorambucil and 4.8 X 10(2) M-1 . min-1 for chlorambucyl-proline. Chlorambucyl [U-14C]L-proline reacts 1:1 with the converting enzyme and the uptake of radioactivity paralleled the loss of enzyme activity with and without protection by Phe-Pro. Once bound, the radioactive chlorambucyl proline was released (as the dihydroxy derivative) by hydroxide ion with a second order rate constant of 2.2 M-1 . min-1 at 25 degrees C. The radioactive label is also removed by hydroxylamine at pH 10. The lability of the irreversibly bound inhibitor in alkali and in hydroxylamine indicates that an ester bond is formed by the alkylation of an aspartic acid or glutamic acid side chain.", 
    "228": "Systemic vasodilators represent a new approach in the treatment of the acute and chronic heart failure, as they reduce the afterload acting on the aortic impedance and/or the venous return to the heart. Vasodilators have been classified as venodilators (nitrates), which reduce left ventricular filling pressure and relieve pulmonary congestion; arteriolar dilators (hydralazine, phentolamine) which enhance cardiac output; and balanced vasodilator (nitroprusside, prazosin), which dilate both resistance and capacitance vessels. While nitroprusside and phentolamine are used in the treatment of the acute myocardial infarction, nitrates, hydralazine and prazosin are used in the long term treatment of the chronic congestive heart failure. Presumably, the renin-angiotensin system plays an important role in increasing peripheric vascular resistance in congestive heart failure. For this reason the inhibitors of the angiotensin-converting enzyme, such as captopril and teprotide, are also used. The treatment with vasodilators, recommended to patients with severe heart failure, is not an alternative to that with digitalis and diuretics: such a combination may in fact result as a very useful one.", 
    "229": "The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of captopril (CAP) and hydrochlorothiazide (HTZ), alone and in combination, on mean (+/- S.D.) blood pressure (BP), plasma renin activity (PRA), and plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) in equal groups of six patients with low-renin and normal-renin essential hypertension. Renin classification was determined after furosemide (80 mg) stimulation; control measurements were made after each patient had been off all medications for at least 1 week. After a single 25 mg dose of CAP, BP decreased, PRA increased, and PAC decreased more (p less than 0.05) in the normal- than in the low-renin group. Each patient was then given the following in sequence for at least 2 weeks: CAP 25 mg t.i.d., HTZ 50 mg/day, and the combination. The results at the end of each treatment period indicated a modest, but significant reduction in blood pressure in both groups following CAP and HTZ; the effect of the combination was additive. Within each renin group under similar conditions there was no significant difference in mean PRA or PAC after each treatment. Thus, while the short-term effect of CAP on BP differed in patients with low- and normal-renin essential hypertension, the effect after chronic CAP was similar, comparable to that of HTZ and additive in combination in both groups.", 
    "230": "Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) developed in 13 out of 78 patients treated with captopril for a mean period of 11 months. In another 11 patients, who were ANA-positive before captopril therapy, no increase in ANA titer was observed during treatment. Neither the development nor the presence of ANA before captopril treatment were associated with (drug-induced) lupus erythematosus or increased incidence of clinical side-effects, although development of ANA was accompanied by a serum-sickness-like syndrome in one patient. The ANA were mainly of the IgM class, did not fix complement and were transiently present. In three patients, antinative DNA antibodies, exclusively of IgM class and not complement-fixing, were transiently present without clinical signs of systemic lupus erythematosus, although recurrence of these antibodies was associated with slight proteinuria in one of them.", 
    "231": "In spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), captopril at 30 and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) at 100 mg/kg/day p.o. for 2 days lowered mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) 16 and 10 mm Hg, respectively. Treatment with the combination of captopril plus HCTZ for one day lowered MABP to the same extent as captopril alone, but produced a synergistic 44 mm Hg MABP lowering after the second day combination treatment. Bilateral ureteral ligation did not prevent the synergistic antihypertensive effect demonstrating that removal of electrolytes was not the cause of this effect. Cardiovascular responses to angiotensin-I and -II, norepinephrine or bradykinin did not differ in rats given the combination or captopril alone. After the combination treatment for one day, captopril but not HCTZ alone on the second day lowered MABP in rats to the same degree as in those receiving the combination treatment for 2 days, suggesting that the diuretic action per se is unimportant. Captopril and HCTZ increased plasma renin activity (PRA) but only the combination of captopril and HCTZ produced a greater and longer lasting increase of PRA. It is concluded that the mechanism for the synergism is the renin dependency, created by the combination of HCTZ and captopril, resulting in a greater role of the renin system in blood pressure control and increased responsiveness to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition by captopril.", 
    "232": "Captopril (SQ 14225) is an orally active agent that inhibits the conversion of ang. I to ang. II and also potentiates the biological actions of kinins. This substance has been used to study the role of ang. II/kinins on the norepinephrine-induced vasoconstriction in the isolated perfused mesentery and hindquarters of the rat. The vasoconstrictor responses were measured as an increase in the perfusion pressure (mm Hg), induced by sequential injections of norepinephrine. Captopril/placebo (physiological saline solution) was administered in a dose of 1 mg/kg by oral route, 15-20 min before isolating the vascular beds from these rats. Oral administration of captopril, decreased the vascular reactivity to norepinephrine in both the vascular beds, when compared to the responses obtained in the placebo treated rats. In another series of experiments (normal rats) bradykinin (BK), at concentrations of 0.4 and 0.8 micrograms/ml in the perfusate, attenuated the norepinephrine-induced vasoconstriction dose dependently, only in the mesenteric bed. It may be concluded that captopril attenuated the vascular reactivity to norepinephrine either by decreasing ang. II formation and/or increasing the action of kinins in the vicinity of these two beds. The latter mechanisms, however, appears not to play any direct role in the hindquarter bed. The direct effects of captopril on the decreased vascular reactivity of these beds cannot, however, be ruled out.", 
    "233": "Conscious rats with two-kidney one clip Goldblatt hypertension had the constricting clip removed during continuous infusion of either dextrose, saralasin, or captopril. Other dextrose-infused animals underwent removal of the ischemic kidney or a sham procedure. Direct arterial blood pressure (BP) was recorded throughout the 15-hour preoperative and subsequent 24-hour postoperative period. Rats were studied in the \"early\" phase (1-3 weeks duration) or \"chronic\" phase (greater than 4 months) of hypertension. Animals subjected to a sham procedure returned to preoperative BP values. The BP of animals unclipped or nephrectomized did not return to previous hypertensive levels. Instead, a biphasic response was seen where BP partially recovered from an operative fall and then slowly declined to normal at 24 hours; this effect occurred in both stages of hypertension. At 24 hours, removal of the ischemic kidney was as effective as removal of the constricting clip in the correction of both early and chronic phase hypertension. Rats infused with saralasin or captopril demonstrated an acute (within 2 hours) and sustained fall in BP, but not to normotensive levels. This fall was significant in all animals (p less than 0.01) apart from chronic phase rats infused with saralasin where no significant fall was seen. Although animals infused with saralasin or captopril commenced at a lower preoperative BP, the biphasic pattern of response to unclipping was identical to that of dextrose-infused unclipped rats. Thus, sustained inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system did not modify the correction of hypertension produced by removal of the constricting clip, and the response to surgical correction did not appear to be entirely mediated by changes in the activity of the renin-angiotensin system, particularly in the chronic stage. Equally, the rapidity of correction is not consistent with a role of vascular hypertrophy.", 
    "234": "The effect of acute administration of captopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, on vascular responses of rings of rat aortic smooth muscle was tested in vitro. Dose-response curves for various vasoactive agents were obtained before and after exposure to captopril (2 x 10(-4) M) for 30 minutes. In the presence of captopril, contractile responses to angiotensin I (5 x 10(-10) to 5 x 10(-8) M) were attenuated significantly, probably as a result of decreased local conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Contractile responses to angiotensin II (10(-11) to 5 x 10(-9) M) were not affected by captopril. All responses to norepinephrine (10(-9) to 10(-4) M) and phenylephrine (10(-8) to 10(-4) M) were attenuated significantly from control in the presence of captopril. In the presence of the alpha-adrenergic antagonist, phentolamine, captopril did not affect either the contractile responses to KCl (30 to 100 mM) or the isoproterenol-induced (10(-8) to 10(-5) M) relaxation of KCl-depolarized tissue. These results suggest that captopril decreased vascular responsiveness to alpha-adrenergic agonists but not to beta-adrenergic agonists. Low concentrations of bradykinin (10(-10) to 10(-8) M) induced contraction in KCl-depolarized tissue while higher concentrations (10(-7) and 10(-6) M) induced relaxation. In the presence of captopril, relaxation occurred at all concentrations of bradykinin (10(-10) to 10(-6) M), probably as a result of decreased degradation of the bradykinin. These data suggest depression of alpha-adrenergic responsiveness in vascular smooth muscle as another potential antihypertensive action of captopril.", 
    "235": "Captopril (SQ 14,225), an orally active angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, increased drinking and produced water diuresis in rats when given orally at a dose of 100 mg.kg-1.day-1. Chronic intraperitoneal infusion of angiotensin (ANG) II or the ANG II antagonist [Sar1, Ile8]ANG II abolished this response. Intracerebroventricular (icv) captopril infused chronically reduced the dipsogenic response to oral captopril. [Sar1, Ile8]ANG II (icv) was without effect on captopril-induced drinking. These results suggest that drinking produced by chronic oral treatment of rats with captopril may be caused by the effects of the elevated ANG I concentrations achieved after blockade of ACE and stimulation of renin secretion by captopril. Systemic ANG II may reduce this response by decreasing renin secretion. Systemic [Sar1, Ile8]ANG II presumably blocks brain ANG receptors for blood-borne ANG. Since icv [Sar1, Ile8]ANG II is ineffective, the receptors for systemic and icv ANG appear to be distinct. Orally administered captopril does not diffuse into the brain.", 
    "236": "We report on a patient with renal artery stenosis who had only 1 kidney and in whom acute renal impairment developed with transient anuria after the administration of captopril. Although inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme is considered to be efficient treatment for hypertension associated with chronic renal failure, care should be taken when captopril is administered initially to a patient with decreased renal function, under the conditions of sodium and water depletion. The renovascular hypertension in this patient was treated successfully by renal autotransplantation.", 
    "237": "A 38-year-old woman with hypercalcemia, severe hypertension, and high renin levels was treated with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril. This therapy, together with spironolactone, normalized blood pressure (BP), but even with three daily administrations of the converting enzyme inhibitor, intermittent rebound hypertension could not be avoided. The administration of only verapamil, an antagonist of calcium transport, did not induce BP control, but when verapamil therapy was combined with administration of captopril and spironolactone, BP could be normalized with only twice-daily administration of the converting enzyme inhibitor. Thus, high plasma calcium levels seem to sensitize the arterioles to the intermittent increase of angiotensin II levels that accompanies captopril therapy.", 
    "238": "Captopril, a competitive antagonist of angiotensin converting enzyme, has been marketed in the United States for the treatment of resistant hypertension. Despite extensive study, its exact mechanism of action remains unclear; decreased renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and sympathoadrenal system activity as well as increased bradykinin and prostaglandin E and F activity have been postulated. The drug decreases peripheral vascular resistance. Controlled trials in resistant hypertension of various etiologies and chronic congestive heart failure have demonstrated sustained effectiveness and therapeutic benefits. Side effects include skin rash, loss of taste, proteinuria, and leukopenia; higher doses and concomitant renal dysfunction appear to be predisposing factors. The benefit-to-risk ratio for captopril clearly justifies its use in resistant cases of hypertension and congestive heart failure, but further experience is needed to evaluate its use in milder forms of these diseases.", 
    "239": "Captopril, competitive inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme, is clinically employed for its antihypertensive activity and drug-dependent granulocytopenia or agranulocytosis have been seldom observed during treatment. In previous unpublished studies an activating effect of the drug on the complement alternate pathway has been demonstrated. In this paper we demonstrate that captopril-treated serum is able to \"in vitro\" induce granulocyte activation and aggregation. Granulocyte aggregation was shown by the turbidimetric method and cellular activation was confirmed by the release of the granule associated enzyme lysozyme and beta-glucuronidase. On this basis complement-mediated leukoaggregation and leukosequestration in vivo could be proposed as the effector mechanism of peripheral leukopenia.", 
    "240": "Cultured JGC contain renin, angiotensin I, angiotensin I-converting enzyme, angiotensin II, and, by implication, the entire RAS. JGC, as transplants, appear to secrete angiotensin II/III directly into the bloodstream to cause hypertension when the renal mass is reduced. There are two main phases of the hypertensive state, an angiotensin-dependent developmental phase and a non-angiotensin-dependent maintenance phase. This model may be useful in attempts to evaluate pro-hypertensive actions of angiotensin other than those due to direct systemic vasoconstriction. Certain of these actions appear to be intrarenal and include the stimulation of sodium reabsorption, a decrease in renopapillary blood flow, the stimulation of prostaglandin synthesis, and a constraint on the antihypertensive function of the RIC.", 
    "241": "Captopril was used for treatment resistant arterial hypertension in 17 dialysis patients. Excellent blood-pressure control with diastolic blood-pressure less than 95 mmHg was obtained in 10 out of 17 patients (59%), with captopril as only drug in 8 patients. Six patients have been treated more than 6 months and 4 patients have been on the treatment for 1 year. The dosage of captopril could be kept low with maintained antihypertensive and angiotensin converting enzyme blocking effects. The acute blood-pressure lowering effect of captopril in dialysis patients was correlated to the initial plasma renin activity (p less than 0.001) but not long-term treatment, which was successful also in several low-renin patients. A few adverse reactions were encountered, e.g. urticaria and bullous exanthema, but all resolved when captopril treatment was stopped. Plasma potassium increased only from 4.8 +/- 0.1 to 5.0 +/- 0.1 mmol/l at the end of 1 month's treatment. Captopril appears to be a valuable drug for treatment of arterial hypertension in dialysis patients and offers an alternative to bilateral nephrectomy for the management of treatment resistant hypertension in these patients.", 
    "242": "Captopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, was used to treat 25 patients with treatment-resistant hypertension of long duration. Seven patients had essential hypertension, 10 renovascular hypertension and 8 renoparenchymatous hypertension. All patients had GFR greater than 25 ml/min/1.73 m3 BSA. The acute blood-pressure-lowering response to the drug was shown to be dependent on the prevailing activity in the renin-angiotensin system. Its long-term effect was not correlated to the activation of the renin-angiotensin system as the mean blood-pressure decrease was not significantly different for high renin and normal renin patients (21 +/- 3% vs. 19 +/- 2%). All patients needed addition of diuretics and betablockers for optimum control. Nine patients have been well controlled for one year and several of them are now approaching two years' treatment. A few adverse effects were observed, including taste disturbances and increased proteinuria. The latter side effect occurred in two patients with decreased renal function and pre-existing proteinuria. Upon reduction of the dose the proteinuria returned to pre-treatment levels within a few months. We conclude that altogether 78% of these patients with treatment-resistant hypertension obtained greatly improved long-term blood-pressure control on treatment including captopril.", 
    "243": "The immediate and sustained haemodynamic effects of Captopril (CPT), an oral inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme, were studied in six patients (pts) with severe pulmonary hypertension (PH) (pulmonary artery pressure: mean +/- SD value = 57 +/- 20 mmHg). Two pts had primary PH, 2 embolic PH and 2 Eisenmenger Physiology (EP). Administration of 100 mg of CPT in a single oral dose produced a significant decrease only in systemic arterial pressure (SAP) (p less than 0.025) and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) (p less than 0.05) in 5 of 6 pts. Heart rate (HR), cardiac index (CI), pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), pulmonary arterial (PAP), pulmonary wedge (PWP) and right atrial pressure (RAP) did not change significantly. These results were confirmed in a repeat haemodynamic study after 4 months of long-term treatment with 50 or 100 mg of CPT 3 times daily. In 1 pt with EP and severe congestive heart failure (CHF) the same chronic treatment produced a marked decrease in HR (from 114 to 88 b/min), RAP (from 10 to 1 mmHg), PWP (from 15 to 6 mmHg), PVR (from 41 to 30 UR), SVR (from 58 to 43 UR). Systemic CI increased from 1.68 to 2.60 l/min/m2 and pulmonary CI from 1.64 to 2.5 l/min/m2; no changes were seen in PAP and SAP. These data suggest that CPT is not effective on pulmonary haemodynamics in pts with precapillary PH and normal CI whereas the drug seems to influence favourably the pulmonary circulation in pts with PH secondary to or associated with left ventricular failure. The necessity of evaluating not only PVR but PAP as well, in studying the effect of vasodilators especially in pts with precapillary PH and normal CI, is discussed. In fact a reduction of PAR without decrease of PAP, as frequently seen in previous reports, is probably due to a primary increase of CI induced by the drug.", 
    "244": "1. Dose-response effects of captopril in an acute model of renovascular hypertension in the anaesthetized rat and in normotensive anaesthetized rats were compared. 2. Intravenous infusions of captopril lowered the blood pressure of both hypertensive and normotensive rats, its minimal active dose being about 0.05 mg/kg. 3. The 0.1 mg/kg dose of captopril normalized the blood pressure of hypertensive rats. 4. The model described herein might be useful for screening inhibitors of the angiotensin-converting enzyme.", 
    "245": "The behaviour of active (AR) and inactive (IR) renin was studied in 48 hypertensive patients (37 with uncomplicated essential hypertension and 11 with reno-vascular hypertension) treated with indomethacin alone or with AR stimulating (bumetanide, tienilic acid, captopril) and inhibiting (atenolol) drugs before and after indomethacin addition. In 10 pts indomethacin (50mg q.i.d./3 days) reduced (p less than 0.05) AR and to a lesser extent IR. In 6 pts bumetanide (1 mg) increased (p less than 0.05) only AR and this effect was abolished by indomethacin. In 6 pts tienilic acid (250 mg) increased (p less than 0.05) only AR and this action was unchanged by indomethacin. In 11 renovascular pts captopril (100mg) increased AR (p less than 0.01) and lesser IR and both these effects were uninfluenced by indomethacin. In 11 essential hypertensive pts captopril (25mg b.i.d./3 days) increased only AR (p less than 0.02), but after 1 year both AR and IR were increased (p less than 0.05) and these effects were abolished by indomethacin. In all the above reported protocols we did never find any inverse correlation between either AR and IR values or their induced changes. These data suggest that prostaglandins stimulate, even if not to a similar extent, both AR and IR and that drugs, which stimulate renin either through or independently of PGs, did not cause any apparent interconversion of plasma IR into AR. In 6 pts atenolol (100 mg daily/6 days) reduced AR (p less than 0.05) and tended to increase IR. Indomethacin addition further decreased AR and reduced IR (both p less than 0.05 vs atenolol alone): however the proportion (% of total) of IR was still reduced. These findings suggest that beta 1-adrenoreceptors blockade exerts a divergent effect on active and inactive renin and that this action is not influenced by PGs synthesis inhibition.", 
    "246": "It has been suggested that a Factor XII-plasma Prekallikrein dependent pathway might play an important role in the activation of inactive renin. Since Captopril has the potential to affect the kinin-kallikrein system, we have studied in a group of 16 patients with essential hypertension its acute effect both on the levels of active, inactive and total renin, and on the contact phase of the coagulation system. Our results show that a single dose of Captopril (25 mg) induces a rapid and persistent increase of active and total renin, while inactive renin tends to decrease. Together with blood pressure, plasma Prekallikrein(PK), Factor XII(FXII) and Factor XI(FXI) concomitantly decrease, although not significantly, and their values seem to return to basal levels soonafter. However, no correlation was found at any time between the levels of any of these coagulation factors, including PK, and those of inactive, active or the ratio inactive/total renin. In spite of that, it is still possible that an activation of PK, which is likely to occur under Captopril administration, may affect at least the conversion of vessel-bound prorenin rather than the circulating form.", 
    "247": "In order to elucidate whether inactive renin may represent a precursor of the active enzyme we examined the short-term effects of ambulation and of Captopril administration on active and cryoactivatable renin in patients with essential hypertension before and after 5 days of diuretic therapy. We have found that in the large majority of patients before diuretic the increments in active renin in response to these stimuli were moderate and associated with unchanged levels of cryoactivatable renin; significant decrements in cryoactivatable renin were observed only in a small group of patients in whom the increments in active renin induced by ambulation were unusually rapid and marked. Diuretic therapy caused parallel increments in baseline values of active and of cryoactivatable renin and potentiated the response of the active enzyme to ambulation and to Captopril; however, cryoactivatable renin was still unmodified during both the acute stimuli. Thus, it appears that, normally, the rise in active renin induced by ambulation and Captopril administration is associated, both before and after diuretic therapy, with unchanged levels of the inactive enzyme; however, before diuretic, abrupt increments in the demand for active renin can determine changes in opposite direction of inactive renin as if the latter were a precursor of the former.", 
    "248": "The significance of active and inactive renin was investigated by comparison of an in vitro assay of active, total and inactive plasma renin concentration (APRC, TPRC, IPRC) and plasma angiotensin II concentration (PA II) with an in vivo change in mean arterial pressure (MAP) produced by angiotensin antagonism with saralasin and by angiotensin converting enzyme blockade with captopril. A significant relationship between the changes in MAP during saralasin and captopril with the pre-treatment level of APRC, TPRC and PA II were found; while the pre-existing level of inactive renin was not a predictor for the hypotensive effect of saralasin and captopril. During captopril and saralasin significant increases in TPRC and APRC were found and no change in IPRC.", 
    "249": "Plasma levels of active and inactive renin were measured in the rat following manipulation of renin release. In the anesthetized rat intravenous captopril or sodium nitroprusside resulted in elevation of active renin only. Neither active nor inactive renin were altered following ether anesthesia of 2 hour bilaterally nephrectomized animals. Elevated levels of active and total renin were observed in anesthetized Wistar rats that had received oral captopril for a 6 week period. Renin substrate was decreased suggesting that blood angiotensin II exerts a tonic influence on renin substrate. In sodium deplete SHR, sacrificed by decapitation, chronic captopril resulted in a significant increase of both the active and inactive form of the enzyme concomitant with blood pressure reduction. The present data further confirm the independent control of active and inactive renin in the rat.", 
    "250": "1. The formation of the S-methyl metabolite of captopril has been demonstrated for the first time in the urine of five patients receiving chronic captopril therapy. 2. Patients were studied following a 100 mg oral dose of captopril. 3. Excretion values for S-methylcaptopril were 0.66 mg and 0.31 mg at 0-3 h and 3-6 h postdose. Captopril excretion was at these two collections 15.5 mg and 2.3 mg, respectively.", 
    "251": "1. A method is described for the measurement of [des-Asp1]-angiotensin I (ANG I 1/2) in blood. 2. Exogenous ANG I 1/2 was rapidly metabolized in conscious sodium replete sheep. 3. Inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme activity by SQ 14 225 (captopril) abolished the production of angiotensin III (ANG III) and the pressor response to infused ANG I 1/2. 4. The endogenous blood concentration of ANG I 1/2 was very low and not significantly elevated by sodium depletion. 5. Although in vivo pulmonary conversion of ANG I 1/2 to ANG III may occur, this pathway appears to be only of minor importance in sheep. 6. In the presence of converting enzyme inhibition by SQ 14 225, the arteriovenous ratio of ANG I 1/2 was 1.29 (s.e.m. = 0.25). This indicates pulmonary production of ANG I 1/2 and the presence in the lung of a peptidase which hydrolyses aspartic acid from angiotensin I.", 
    "252": "The long-term effects of angiotensin I converting enzyme (kininase II) inhibition with Captopril on fluid and electrolyte metabolism, aldosterone secretion, renal function, and arterial pressure were evaluated in conscious sodium deficient dogs. Plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC), plasma renin activity (PRA), urinary sodium excretion (UNaV), arterial pressure (AP), renal blood flow (RBF), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), blood kinin concentration (BK), urinary kinin excretion (UK), and urinary kallikrein activity (UKA) were determined during long-term inhibition of angiotensin I converting enzyme (kininase II). In response to Captopril administration (20 mg/kg/day) PAC decreased from 38.9 +/- 6.7 to 14.3 +/- 2.3 ng/dl, PRA increased from 3.58 +/- 0.53 to 13.7 +/- 1.6 ng/ml/hr, UNaV increased from 0.65 +/- 0.27 to 6.4 +/- 1.2 mEq/day, AP decreased from 102 +/- 3 to 65 +/- 2 mmHg, RBF increased from 136 +/- 7 to 156 +/- 8 ml/min, GFR decreased from 65 +/- 8 to 36 +/- 7 ml/min, BK increased from 0.17 +/- 0.02 to 0.41 +/- 0.04 ng/ml, UK increased from 7.2 +/- 1.5 to 31.4 +/- 3.2 micrograms/day, and UKA decreased from 23.6 +/- 3.1 to 5.3 +/- 1.2 E.U./day. Aldosterone infusion in sodium deficient dogs maintained on Captopril failed to alter urinary sodium excretion, renal function, or arterial blood pressure. However, angiotensin II infusion (3 ng/kg/min) restored aldosterone secretion, renal function, and arterial blood pressure within three days to levels observed in untreated sodium deficient dogs. The marked alterations in renal function and urinary sodium excretion during angiotensin II infusion indicate that angiotensin II is several times more potent than aldosterone in the long-term control of sodium excretion. Also, our studies demonstrated that the long-term hypotensive and natriuretic actions of inhibitors of angiotensin I converting enzyme (kininase II) are mediated by inhibition of angiotensin II formation.", 
    "253": "1 In a randomised study, 475 men with diastolic blood pressures of 92-109 mm Hg received either placebo or captopril 37.5 mg, 75 mg or 150 mg/day for 7 weeks. 2 After 7 weeks patients taking placebo were given hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg twice daily, as were two-thirds of each group taking captopril and they were observed for 7 additional weeks. 3 Captopril reduced blood pressure by 12.2 +/- 0.8/9.4 +/- 0.4 mm Hg at 7 weeks (n = 323) and captopril plus placebo reduced it by 10.3 +/- 1.9/10.2 +/- 0.9 mm Hg at 14 weeks (n = 83); placebo by 2.0 +/- 1.7/3.4 +/- 0.8 mm Hg (n = 76); and captopril plus hydrochlorothiazide by 24.4 +/- 1.1/16.2 +/- 0.6 mm Hg (n = 173). The effect of low-dose captopril was similar to that of high doses. 4 White patients responded better than blacks, with a blood pressure reduction of 14.7 +/- 1.1/10.7 +/- 0.6 mm Hg (n = 170) v 9.1 +/- 1.2/8.0 +/- 0.7 mm Hg (n = 151). This difference was abolished by the addition of hydrochlorothiazide. 5 Only 15/384 (3.9%) of patients were dropped from the study because of adverse effects. 6 The prescription of low-dose captopril might be extendable to patients with mild to moderate hypertension.", 
    "254": "1 A study was carried out to investigate the possible contribution of prostaglandins in captopril-induced hypotension. 2 Healthy volunteers and patients with essential hypertension were given single oral doses of 25 mg and 50 mg captopril respectively before and after cyclo-oxygenase inhibition with indomethacin. 3 The acute hypotensive effect of captopril was not associated with changes in heart rate. As expected, captopril led to an increase in plasma renin activity, decrease in plasma angiotensin II, and decrease in plasma aldosterone concentration. 4 After acute indomethacin pretreatment the acute hypotensive effect of captopril was significantly blunted in volunteers and in the 14 hypertensive patients. Changes in plasma renin activity and angiotensin II were significantly lower from a lower baseline. 5 Prostaglandins may therefore be mediators of the initial captopril effect. The blunting effect of indomethacin should be taken into account under clinical conditions.", 
    "255": "1 After a period of 7 +/- 1.4 months of good control of hypertension by thrice daily administration of captopril (85 +/- 9 mg three times a day), captopril was given twice daily and the total dose was progressively reduced to sometimes very low levels in 12 patients. Twice daily administration of captopril 85 +/- 9 mg did not modify blood pressure control. 2 During reduction of captopril dosage to a minimum of 36 +/- 4 mg twice a day, the acute effect of the morning dose of captopril (last dose taken at least 12 hours before study) was assessed. Administration of the morning dose induced a decrease in mean arterial pressure from 112 +/- 4 mm Hg (104 +/- 3 mm Hg during administration of 85 +/- 9 mg) three times a day to 106 +/- 4 mm Hg, an increase in plasma renin activity, and a decrease in plasma aldosterone concentration. 3 These acute effects of captopril suggest that blood pressure was well controlled in the presence of a non-blocked circulating angiotensin-converting-enzyme activity, thus raising the possibility of alternate mechanisms by which captopril reduces arterial pressure. 4 The daily dosage of captopril needed to control hypertension may be reassessed after a certain period of good blood pressure control with 50 to 100 mg captopril three times a day.", 
    "256": "1 The long-term effects of the oral angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril with the addition of a diuretic (chlorthalidone) were examined in 16 patients with moderate or grave hypertension. Of these, 14 had essential hypertension and two renovascular hypertension. 2 Blood pressure fell sharply in all patients and this antihypertensive effect was maintained during 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24-month follow-up periods. The efficacy of treatment was not predicted by basal values of plasma renin activity. 3 Urinary excretion of sodium and potassium increased, but the increases were never such as to modify significantly sodium and potassium serum concentration. 4 The long-term treatment was generally well tolerated.", 
    "257": "1 The long-term effect of the converting-enzyme inhibitor captopril was investigated in 76 patients with various forms of severe hypertension, most cases being resistant to a standardised triple therapy (100 mg hydrochlorothiazide or 80-500 mg frusemide; 320 mg propranolol; and 200 mg hydralazine). 2 In each of the three groups examined (essential, renovascular, and renal parenchymatous hypertension) captopril led to a prompt and sustained reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Up to an observation time of 2 1/2 years patients with renovascular hypertension showed a more pronounced fall in mean diastolic blood pressures than those with essential hypertension. About 90% of all patients required a diuretic and a substantial percentage of patients needed propranolol as a third drug. 3 The most frequent side effects were skin manifestations, taste disturbances, dizziness, and non-productive cough. Serious adverse effects were rare and included one case of leucopenia and one of the nephrotic syndrome, both of them reversed after withdrawal of captopril. Further analysis showed that side effects occurred mainly in patients with impaired kidney function receiving relatively high dosages of captopril (greater than 200 mg/day). 4 Our results show that captopril is a very potent blood-pressure-lowering agent in severe hypertension, especially in cases with renovascular hypertension.", 
    "258": "1 In an open study the clinical short-term and long-term effects of low-dose captopril (mean daily dose 45 +/- 15 mg) were evaluated in 20 patients with severe congestive heart failure refractory to conventional treatment with digitalis and diuretics. 2 After two weeks' treatment 16 out of 20 patients showed an improvement in New York Heart Association functional class, followed by a significant reduction in body weight and heart volume. The ratio between urinary sodium and potassium excretion was significantly increased and the urinary aldosterone excretion was significantly decrease. In 10 of the patients the initial effects were sustained during long-term treatment (6 +/- 2 months). 3 In conclusion, captopril may be a useful therapeutic adjunct for the long-term treatment of patients with severe heart failure or when conventional treatment has failed.", 
    "259": "1 The efficacy of the converting-enzyme inhibitor captopril in the management of severe congestive heart failure was assessed in 14 patients over 360-885 days by clinical evaluation, M-mode echocardiography, systolic time intervals, plasma renin activity, and plasma aldosterone. 2 As compared with baseline values, a significant reduction was observed in heart rate, mean arterial pressure, left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic diameters, left ventricular pre-ejection period, tension time index, body weight, and plasma aldosterone. Significant increases in left ventricular ejection time and fractional circumferential shortening (p less than 0.01) were also observed. 3 The functional and haemodynamic benefit provided by captopril was therefore sustained during long-term therapy without severe untoward effects or attenuation.", 
    "260": "1 Although many vasodilators are effective in the treatment of severe congestive heart failure, there have been few comparative studies of these drugs. We compared the acute haemodynamic effects of captopril and hydralazine in 11 patients with congestive cardiac failure unresponsive to diuretics and digoxin. Both drugs increased resting cardiac index, although this effect appeared more pronounced for hydralazine (33% v 23%). Captopril reduced pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (-8 mm Hg, p less than 0.01) which decreased only slightly on hydralazine. 2 Long-term treatment was then started on the dose found effective during acute administration. Each drug was given for eight weeks. Exercise tolerance improved with both drugs, the increase during the hydralazine phase correlating with the increase in cardiac index at rest (r = 0.75; p less than 0.05). Clinical improvement appeared more definite on captopril than on hydralazine, however. This improvement was maintained during the captopril phase only in those patients who had a greater than 25% reduction in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure in the acute study.", 
    "261": "1 The favourable haemodynamic effects of captopril in patients with congestive heart failure have been reported. 2 We have treated 25 patients with severe chronic congestive heart failure with captopril in doses of 75-450 mg daily. Before entering the study all patients remained in New York Heart Association functional class IV despite high-dose diuretic and vasodilator therapy. 3 Mean cardiothoracic ratio was 60%, and all patients had a shortening fraction of 18% or less on echocardiography (normal 25 to 40%). 4 Five patients died within one month of captopril and five between four and seven months, three of whom had improved to class IIM and one to IIS before death. 5 Of the 15 survivors one was referred for a heart transplant when he had improved to class IIM. The remaining 14 patients were followed for 8-16 months. Ten improved to New York Heart Association class I or IIS and four to class IIM or III. Diuretic requirements were decreased considerably in all 14. Side effects were common but captopril did not have to be withdrawn. Captopril is a highly effective drug in the treatment of patients with congestive heart failure refractory to currently accepted therapy.", 
    "262": "1 To determine the distribution of flow, the regional haemodynamic response to 100 mg of captopril was determined in 36 patients with refractory cardiac heart failure. Measurements included forearm blood flow by venous occlusion plethysmography (eight patients), splanchnic blood flow by indocyanine green clearance (10 patients), and coronary blood flow by thermodilution (12 patients). 2 Cardiac index significantly rose in one hour (1.9 +/- 0.1 to 2.2 +/- 0.1 1/m/m2, p less than 0.01) while forearm blood flow rose slightly (2.9 +/- 0.8 to 3.2 +/- 0.3 ml/100 ml/min). Renal blood flow rose significantly by 30% (344 +/- 48 to 533 +/- 82 ml/min, p less than 0.02). Despite a fall in rate pressure product (8.8 +/- 0.7 to 7.1 +/- 0.5 mm Hg bt x 10(3), p less than 0.02), coronary blood flow did not significantly change (160 +/- 20 to 133 +/- 12 ml/min), indicating an improved supply-demand relationship. 3 External myocardial efficiency improved (19 +/- 3 to 26 +/- 6%, p less than 0.05). Coronary blood flow is unaffected and converting-enzyme inhibitor improves myocardial efficiency. This strategic reduction in vascular impedence distinguishes converting-enzyme inhibitors as a unique class of vasodilators in the treatment of coronary heart failure.", 
    "263": "1 The clinical and haemodynamic effects of low doses of the oral converting-enzyme inhibitor captopril were studied in 18 patients with severe chronic heart failure. Increasing doses of 1 mg, 2.5 mg, 6.25 mg, 12.5 mg, and 25 mg captopril were given at two hour intervals with haemodynamic monitoring. Graded haemodynamic improvement (increased stroke volume index and reduced mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure) occurred from one hour with reduction of blood pressure closely associated. 2 Maximal haemodynamic improvement for the group was seen at six and seven hours after the 6.25 mg and 12.5 mg doses, when stroke volume index was increased by 35% and mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure reduced by 40% from control. Captopril 12.5 mg-50 mg eight hourly was continued long-term but withdrawn in two patients with symptomatic hypotension and one patient with altered taste. 3 Four patients died and one was non-compliant with therapy. At three months 10 patients showed significant improvement in symptoms, treadmill exercise duration, and echocardiographic indices of left ventricular size and function. The results of repeat haemodynamic measurements were similar to optimal measurements obtained during the initial study. 4 At two years six patients remained alive, five having maintained their symptomatic improvement. Thus small doses of captopril produce haemodynamic improvement in heart failure with a closely associated reduction of blood pressure. Symptomatic and haemodynamic benefit is maintained with long-term treatment.", 
    "264": "1 Forty-one patients with primary (essential) hypertension were treated with captopril alone or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide for 12-36 months. 2 During an initial dose-titration period mean blood pressure fell from 174/111 mm Hg to 134/88 mm Hg supine and from 170/116 mm Hg to 126/93 mm Hg standing after 3 months' treatment. 3 During long-term treatment with unchanged or reduced doses of captopril or hydrochlorothiazide, or both, blood pressure remained substantially reduced. Mean supine blood pressure at 24 months was 136/90 mm Hg and at 36 months 138/90 mm Hg. 4 In 12 patients with clearly defined low renin (essential) hypertension initial blood pressure reduction was less than in patients with normal renin hypertension after 1 month's treatment (162/102 mm Hg v 143/92 mm Hg). After 24 months of treatment, however, the treatment results were similar in the two groups. 5 Except for one case of reversible proteinuria no serious side effects were seen during treatment periods of up to three years. 6 Captopril alone or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide seems to be an effective and safe drug in the long-term treatment of primary hypertension.", 
    "265": "1 A placebo-controlled, randomised double-blind comparison of captopril 25 mg three times a day, hydrochlorothiazide 15 mg three times a day, and the combination was conducted in 207 patients with essential hypertension with supine diastolic blood pressures of 92-110 mm Hg. Significant decreases in blood pressure were seen in all three groups; the magnitude of decrease seen with captopril and hydrochlorothiazide was similar, while the combination produced an additive response greater (p less than 0.001) than captopril or hydrochlorothiazide alone. 2 The major side effect reported was a rash in fewer than 6% of patients taking captopril alone or in combination. Loss of taste or proteinuria was not observed. 3 The addition of captopril of hydrochlorothiazide blunted the hypokalaemia and hyperuricaemia observed with hydrochlorothiazide alone in addition to its antihypertensive synergy. These observations indicate that this relatively low dose of captopril is safe and efficacious in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension alone and particularly when combined with a thiazide diuretic.", 
    "266": "1 Among 34 patients with mild essential hypertension treated for four weeks with captopril alone the blood pressure of 47% returned to normal. By the end of the fourth week chlorthalidone had been added to captopril in 18 of the patients; 15 then achieved normal blood pressure, and only three failed to achieve diastolic blood pressures of under 100 mm Hg. 2 Among the 16 patients who continued to take captopril alone after the fourth week all achieved a return to normal blood pressure during the next 12 months of treatment. 3 Side effects of captopril were essentially limited to rash, taste alteration, and nausea and vomiting, which were usually mild and transient.", 
    "267": "1 Fifty-seven patients with mild or moderate essential hypertension, mean age 50 (range 31-69) were randomised to treatment with either captopril or atenolol. Twenty-six patients in each group completed the study. 2 Captopril (25-50 mg three times daily) and atenolol (50-100 mg once daily) caused a highly significant fall in blood pressure both supine and standing. 3 When hydrochlorothiazide (25-50 mg once daily) was added a further fall in blood pressure was observed in both groups. 4 Captopril as single drug caused no significant change in heart rate, while atenolol significantly reduced heart rate both supine and standing. 5 Two patients were excluded from the captopril group, one because of a reversible loss of taste and the other because of dizziness. Three patients were excluded from the atenolol group, two because of bradyarrhythmias and one because of inadequate blood pressure response. 6 Both captopril and atenolol were found to be effective antihypertensive agents, suitable for the treatment of essential hypertension.", 
    "268": "1 Forty-one patients with essential hypertension, stages I, II, and III, were treated with captopril alone or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide. Forty two percent were responsive to captopril alone, while the remaining 58% also required the diuretic. The need for the diuretic was related to the phase of hypertension. 2 There was no significant relation between drug response and plasma renin activity. Serum concentrations of creatinine and potassium remained normal, and there were no pathological changes in serum glucose, cholesterol, uric acid concentrations, erythrocyte count, packed cell volume, haemoglobin, or heart rate. 3 Captopril was well tolerated. One patient developed a rash and another ageusia, which disappeared spontaneously. A third, who was also taking allopurinol, developed leucopenia but it disappeared after treatment was withdrawn. There were no cases of proteinuria attributable to captopril; and proteinuria disappeared in four of five patients who were proteinurin before the start of treatment. 4 These findings suggest that doses of captopril of 150 mg to 300 mg (with or without a diuretic) may be adequate for controlling the blood pressure of most patients with essential hypertension.", 
    "269": "A 22-year-old Japanese man with bilateral renal artery stenosis associated with hypertension underwent successful surgery of simultaneous bilateral renal artery reconstruction under conditions of intraoperative renal perfusion with St. Thomas Hospital solution which is used for cardioplegia in open heart surgery. Circulation in the left kidney was interrupted for 58 minutes and that of the right kidney for 35 minutes. The patient fully recovered with no serious impairment of renal function. In addition to these stenotic lesions of the renal artery, there were medial necrosis of the aorta and fibromuscular dysplasia of the superior mesenteric artery. Administration of SQ14,225, an angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor, was effective in controlling hypertension during the preoperative period.", 
    "270": "Sequential changes in exchangeable sodium, fluid intake, blood pressure and plasma renin activity were measured in 2K1C hypertensive rats during the development of severe hypertension. Exchangeable sodium was measured by the equilibration of the rats' exchangeable sodium with radioactive saline. In rats drinking saline, both PRA and exchangeable sodium levels increased as hypertension developed, and captopril induced large falls in blood pressure. Subsequent removal of the contralateral kidney reduced PRA, but did not alter exchangeable sodium or blood pressure. Captoril had no effect on blood pressure. It is concluded that the rise in PRA in 2K1C hypertension depends on the presence of the contralateral kidney, but occurs in the absence of sodium depletion.", 
    "271": "The acute blood pressure response to the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, was used to measure participation of the renin-angiotensin system in treatment-resistant hypertension. By 2 h after a single 25-mg oral captopril dose in patients still receiving a diuretic-vasodilator-beta-blocker combination, systolic and diastolic blood pressures had fallen significantly; the decrease in diastolic pressure correlated with the control (immediately pre-captopril) plasma renin activity (r = 0.64, p less than 0.001). Apart from its possible contribution to the underlying hypertension, this captopril-identified renin component may have reflected diuretic and vasodilator-induced renin stimulation that could not adequately be prevented by the renin-lowering properties of the beta-blocker. Captopril, and perhaps other specific antirenin drugs, therefore, may be valuable adjuncts to treatment in patients with hypertension refractory to conventional therapy.", 
    "272": "1. Molecular and kinetic properties of angiotensin converting enzymes from seven different species' kidneys were similar concerning apparent molecular weight, heat sensitivity, Km value, optimum pH, activation by chloride ion, and inhibition by specific converting enzyme inhibitors (captopril and SA 446). 2. Rabbit antibody against pure human kidney enzyme cross-reacted partially with each animal kidney enzyme except for the rabbit enzyme. Antigenic determinants of animal enzymes were variable from species to species and differed from those of the human enzyme in extent and specificity.", 
    "273": "In 10 severely hypertensive patients, on a low sodium diet, converting enzyme inhibition increased plasma renin activity and decreased plasma renin substrate. The use of direct radioimmunoassays for both the enzyme and its substrate showed that the number of immunoreactive renin molecules increased from 11.3 +/- 4.9 to 31.7 +/- 25.3 pmol 1(-1) whereas the number of immunoreactive renin substrate molecules decreased from 1.04 +/- 0.35 to 0.74 +/- 0.16 mumol 1(-1). The direct radioimmunoassay for angiotensinogen gave higher values than the direct enzymatic assay, and during converting enzyme inhibition, the difference between both methods increased in proportion to the rise in circulating renin. It is concluded that the difference between the renin substrate radioimmunoassay, which measures angiotensinogen and des-angio I-angiotensinogen, and the renin substrate enzymatic assay which only measures \"active\" substrate, is an index of the increased consumption of renin substrate, in a situation where the fall in angiotensin II enhances renin release and decreases renin substrate release.", 
    "274": "1. The acute hormonal and hypotensive effects of MK 421 (10 mg p.o.) were assessed by a double-blind randomized trial in twelve subjects with essential hypertension. The study was performed during a normal and low salt intake. 2. Plasma angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity was maximally inhibited by 57 (s.e.m. = 4)% of control activity at 4-8 h. Plasma ACE was still depressed at 24 h by 10% of control activity but had returned to normal by 32 h. 3. Sodium depletion did not alter basal plasma ACE activity, nor change the degree of inhibition of MK 421. 4. Plasma angiotensin II was depressed during ACE inhibition, but no change in circulating bradykinin was detected. Reciprocal rises occurred in plasma renin and angiotensin I levels with a time course similar to ACE inhibition. 5. All subjects showed a fall in their blood pressure, maximal between 6-8 h. Mean arterial pressure fell 12 (s.e.m. = 5) mmHg on the normal sale intake and 16 (s.e.m. = 3) mmHg on the low salt diet, at 8 h. 6. Blood pressure and angiotensin converting enzyme activity changes were significantly correlated (r = 0.86, n = 12).", 
    "275": "1. Sixty-two patients (nineteen mild-moderate, forty-three severe hypertension) were treated with captopril. 2. Blood pressure was controlled long term (with/without diuretics/beta-adrenoreceptor blocking drugs) in sixteen out of nineteen patients with mild-moderate hypertension. Two patients complained of dysguesia. 3. Long term control (with/without other drugs) was achieved in thirty out of forty-three patients with severe or accelerated hypertension, many of whom had associated renal or renovascular disease. Side-effects were common: five rash, five dysguesia, two rash and dysguesia, two reversible agranulocytosis. 4. Six patients had a profound pressure fall after an initial dose of captopril 25 mg and one developed acute oliguric renal failure. Treatment should be commenced at low doses in severely hypertensive patients.", 
    "276": "To investigate whether changes in aldosterone during antihypertensive treatment would be related to alterations in the renin-angiotensin system or to changes in sodium-fluid balance, 54 essential hypertensives were hospitalized. Sodium intake was restricted to 55 mmoles per day. Levels of renin, angiotensin II and aldosterone were measured before and after two weeks treatment with atenolol (n=15), prazosin (n=15), the converting enzyme inhibitor MK 421 (n=6), verapamil (n=9) and the vasodilator L 6150 (n=10). Daily sodium excretion was determined from 24 h urine collections. The results indicate that, when renin or angiotensin levels do not change, the aldosterone response depends on alterations in sodium balance. When the renin system is depressed, sodium loss may prevent a large drop in aldosterone levels. It is concluded that during antihypertensive treatment body sodium status in itself modifies aldosterone secretion, irrespective of the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "277": "The effect of captopril was explored in salt-depleted methylprednisolone (MP)-hypertensive rats. MP treatment raised BP by 41+/-2 mmHg over 2 weeks. Controls (C) had no change in BP. Sodium balance and weight data indicated a greater salt depletion in MP than in C. On day 15, captopril reduced BP in both MP (20+/-4 mmHg) and C (31+/-4 mmHg). The effect was significantly smaller in MP than in C (p less than 0.05). Plasma renin activity (PRA) was similarly elevated in both groups, consistent with salt depletion. Serum (SCE) and lung-converting enzyme (LCE) activity were similar in MP and C. The diminished antihypertensive effect of captopril in MP is therefore not attributable to differences in PRA, SCE, or LCE. Our data suggest that depressor actions of captopril unrelated to the renin-angiotensin system are impaired in MP. Glucocorticoid-induced changes in vasodilator systems may explain these findings.", 
    "278": "Prolonged low-dose ACTH infusion (5 or 10 iU/24h) leads to a transient increase in plasma renin activity and angiotensin II concentration in normal man. In order to find out whether the increase in angiotensin II stimulates aldosterone secretion, 12 normal men received ACTH (10 IU/24h) for 34 hours altogether, 6 with and 6 without simultaneous administration of captopril, 50 mg every 6 hours. Captopril prevented the increase in plasma angiotensin II during ACTH infusion and lowered its levels below those on the control day two hours after a new dose of the converting enzyme inhibitor was given. The increase in plasma cortisol was similar in both groups. The increase in plasma aldosterone was significantly blunted by captopril. The early blood pressure rise and the kaliuresis during ACTH infusion were also significantly decreased in the captopril group. These results suggest that angiotensin II mediates in part the effect of ACTH on aldosterone and blood pressure during the first 2 days of infusion. Since captopril reduced plasma angiotensin II for some time below normal, it is alternatively possible that ACTH requires normal plasma angiotensin II levels for a full effect on aldosterone secretion.", 
    "279": "It is well established that the response of plasma aldosterone to ACTH is enhanced in the sodium depleted state. The mechanisms for this phenomenon are not clear, however, and the present study was undertaken to determine the possible participation of endogenous prostaglandins. ACTH, 250 ug by i.m. administration, was given to 10 human subjects pretreated in four different ways: 1. Control, receiving a 200 mEq per day sodium diet; 2. Sodium depletion (60 mEq/day sodium plus furosemide) plus indomethacin; 3. Sodium depletion plus indomethacin plus captopril; and 4. Sodium depletion plus captopril. Only in the last group, in which the prostaglandin cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin, was not given during the sodium depletion, did an exaggerated aldosterone response to ACTH occur (an increase of 468% compared with an increase of 182% during control, P less than 0.005). The angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, did not effect this response. Thus, endogenous prostaglandins appear to be of far greater importance than the renin-angiotensin system in mediating the increased aldosterone response to ACTH administration during the sodium depleted state in man.", 
    "280": "1 The angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor captopril is known to produce beneficial haemodynamic effects in patients with chronic congestive heart failure. 2 Twelve patients with chronic congestive heart failure were conventionally treated with digitalis and diuretic therapy plus oral captopril (75-150 mg/day), and 14 patients were used as a control group. 3 There was no improvement in functional and haemodynamic values in the controls, but the patients treated with captopril showed a significant functional improvement (increase of exercise time and improvement in New York Heart Association functional class), a definitive decrease in systemic vascular resistance (20%), and a significant increase in the cardiac index and ejection fraction (18% and 28% respectively).", 
    "281": "1 Thirty-one patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension were treated with captopril for 30 months. 2 Captopril effectively lowered raised blood pressure in hypertensive patients with high, low, and normal renin concentrations. There was no significant change in heart rates. Captopril alone normalised blood pressure (diastolic pressure below 95 mm Hg) in 11 patients. In the other patients the addition of hydrochlorothiazide produced a further hypotensive effect. Blood pressure control could be maintained without any signs of tachyphylaxis. 3 Plasma concentrations of aldosterone and angiotensin II were significantly lower after 30 months of therapy than pretreatment values whether captopril was associated with diuretics or not. No relevant symptomatic or biochemical adverse reactions were observed. 4 These data establish the long-term potential of captopril for outpatient therapy in mild-to-moderate forms of essential hypertension.", 
    "282": "A decade of experimentation, with work in the last four years greatly accelerated by the availability of captopril, favors the conclusion that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors exert their antihypertensive effect by blocking the formation of angiotensin II. The apparently anomalous efficacy of ACE inhibitors in hypertension characterized by low circulating renin levels may point to the importance of the vascular renin-angiotensin system in controlling blood pressure. Neither kinin potentiation nor blockade of the CNS renin-angiotensin system appear to play a significant role in the antihypertensive effect of captopril. Pharmacological and clinical studies on ACE inhibitors of novel chemical structure will establish their utility as antihypertensive agents and may lead to greater understanding of the mechanism of action of all ACE inhibitors.", 
    "283": "Captopril (30 mg/kg/day orally for two days) in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) inhibited serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity 92.3%; increased plasma renin activity (PRA) 18-fold and reduced mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) 19 mm Hg. Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) (100 mg/kg-day 1; 10 mg/kg-day 2, orally) increased PRA 3-fold but did not affect serum ACE or MABP. HCTZ plus captopril inhibited serum ACE 95.2%; increased PRA 38-fold and reduced MABP 47.5 mm Hg. Captopril or HCTZ plus captopril did not alter the responses of isolated aortic strips to norepinephrine (NE), serotonin, angiotensin II (AII) or isoproterenol. Pressor responses of conscious SHR to AII and NE were unaltered by captopril or HCTZ plus captopril although the bradykinin-induced depressor responses were significantly but equally potentiated. These results suggest that the potentiating effect of HCTZ is due to some mechanism that shifts the animal's blood pressure maintenance system to a renin-dependent state and is not due to changes in vascular reactivity.", 
    "284": "Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors represent a new class of agents which were designed to retain only that unique property. Because of this inhibition, administration of these agents results in the significant reduction of elevated blood pressure of various etiologies and in the amelioration of symptoms associated with congestive heart failure resistant to digitalis glycosides and diuretics. The mechanism(s) of action is not entirely certain but almost certainly resides in the inhibition of ACE. Certainly, the future will see still further advances made in this therapeutic area as well as with other inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "285": "Eight hypertensive patients on chronic captopril treatment were studied: blood pressure, plasma converting enzyme activity (pCEA) and various components of plasma renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system were measured repeatedly, immediately before and up to 7 hours after the usual morning dose of captopril in 5 patients, or a matching placebo in 3 patients. In the patients, receiving a placebo no significant changes were observed over a 7 hour period in pCEA, plasma r\u00e9nin activity (PRA), plasma angiotensin II (ANG II) plasma aldosterone (PAC) and blood pressure. In patients receive captopril (200 mg) pCEA rapidly decreased, reaching after 2 hours a minimum, corresponding to nearly 20 per cent of its reference value. Thereafter pCEA increased and after 7 hours remained only slightly depressed. Within the first hour after captopril intake a small but significant decrease of ANG II and PAC was observed, while PRA and blood pressure remained unchanged throughout the study period. A continuous low pCEA level is therefore not necessary to achieve a sustained blood pressure lowering effect during chronic captopril treatment.", 
    "286": "The blood pressure and serum angiotensin-I converting enzyme (SACE) activity were measured in captopril-treated hypertensive patients at frequent intervals. Inhibition of SACE was observed in patients responding to the treatment with lowering of blood pressure as well as in nonresponding cases. It was therefore concluded that a mechanism not depending on the formation of angiotensin-II by ACE is responsible for the high blood pressure persisting in the captopril treated nonresponding hypertensive patients. SACE activity in sera of captopril-treated patients recovers from inhibition when stored in frozen state at -20 degrees c. An apparent dissociation was therefore observed when regeneration of SACE activity during storage of sera was not taken into account. Meaningful activities are therefore obtained only if the assay is performed without prolonged storage.", 
    "287": "\"MK-421\" a new oral converting enzyme inhibitor was administered to 16 hypertensive patients in doses ranging between 2.5-40 mg once daily for periods of 6-18 weeks. The blood pressure, plasma renin activity, plasma angiotensin II, aldosterone and angiotensin converting enzyme activity were assessed before and during treatment. Blood pressure normalized in 11 patients and decreased significantly in the remaining 5, without significant changes in heart rate or orthostatic hypotension. At 24 hrs after the first effective dose, plasma renin activity remained elevated to 228% whereas plasma angiotensin II was suppressed to 58%, aldosterone was suppressed to 40% and angiotensin converting enzyme activity was suppressed to 16% of the baseline. Magnitude of blood pressure decrement achieved with the maximal dose did not correlate with baseline plasma renin activity levels. No side-effects were noted during the 6-18 week period of observation.", 
    "288": "Angiotensin I converting enzyme activity is detectable in serum and isolated liver granulomas of mice infected with Schistosoma mansoni. At the chronic phase of the infection (20 wk) the intensity of the granulomatous response spontaneously diminishes. Concomitantly, an increase in angiotensin I converting enzyme activity is observed. The objective of this investigation was to determine the source of this elevated angiotensin I converting enzyme activity. In chronically infected mice, measurements showed that angiotensin I converting enzyme activity in hepatic venous blood was higher than that of peripheral venous blood. In contrast, normal mice demonstrated no difference in regional venous angiotensin I converting enzyme activity. Isolated liver granulomas cultured in vitro released angiotensin I converting enzyme into the culture medium. When granulomas were dispersed into single cell suspension, angiotensin I converting enzyme activity was traced to the adherent cell fraction. Both granulomas and adherent cells from granulomas of the chronically (20 wk) infected mice secreted far more angiotensin I converting enzyme than those from animals with acute (8 wk) infection. Cycloheximide partially inhibited enzyme release. We conclude that in murine schistosomiasis, angiotensin I converting enzyme is produced by the granuloma macrophage. The enzyme is released from the granuloma into the circulation probably resulting in increased serum angiotensin I converting enzyme activity. The role of elevated angiotensin I converting enzyme activity within the lesion as well as the circulation remains to be elucidated.", 
    "289": "Twenty sodium-replete patients with hypertension were allocated either to a placebo or to a captopril treatment group. Each patient was investigated in rest-recumbent (RR) and rest-sitting (RS) positions and during an uninterrupted, graded, submaximal exercise test (up to the anaerobic threshold) before treatment, and with a similar protocol 75 minutes after treatment with captopril or placebo on the same morning. Captopril decreased brachial intraarterial pressure by 7/4 mm Hg at RR, by 16/10 mm Hg at RS, and by 19/10 mm Hg during exercise (p less than 0.001), based on a decrease of systemic vascular resistance (p less than 0.001). Slight increases of cardiac output and of heart rate were noted at rest; cardiac output was not significantly affected during exercise, but the increase of heart rate of 2.4 beats/min was significant (p less than 0.01). Captopril decreased pulmonary artery (p less than 0.05) and capillary wedge pressures (p less than 0.001), with unchanged pulmonary vascular resistance. The data indicate that the action of captopril is characterized by arteriolar and possibly venous dilatation both at rest and during exercise. Pulmonary vascular resistance, however, is not affected.", 
    "290": "To determine whether the electrocardiogram (ECG) could detect a reduction in ventricular mass with chronic antihypertensive therapy, ECGs were obtained in two year old female normotensive (NR) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) following nine months of treatment with captopril or water. The ECG of untreated SHR was considerably different than that of age- and sex-matched NR. The notable differences were the increased voltage, left axis deviation, a delay in the intrinsicoid deflection, and the increased frequency of left atrial abnormalities. Chronic captopril therapy produced a substantial reduction in left ventricular mass in the SHR (NR, 0.63 +/- 0.01; SHR, 1.08 +/- 0.03; captopril SHR, 0.80 +/- 0.04 g). The ECG reflected this regression of left ventricular hypertrophy since the voltage and axis of the treated SHR were no longer different than those of NR. Thus, the ECG may be effective in evaluating the regression of cardiac hypertrophy in response to chronic therapy in experimental hypertension.", 
    "291": "We examined the role of the renin-angiotensin system in the regulation of systemic and coronary vascular tone by studying the effect of converting enzyme inhibition by teprotide on systemic and coronary hemodynamic parameters in 14 normal patients undergoing routine cardiac catheterization. Serial hemodynamic measurements were made before and up to 30 minutes after 1 mg/kg of intravenous teprotide. A significant rise in cardiac index and stroke volume index occurred with a fall in systemic vascular resistance. The increase in cardiac index was related to the level of resting plasma renin activity. Blood pressure, pulmonary artery and left ventricular end-diastolic pressures remained unchanged. Coronary sinus thermodilution blood flow also showed no significant change; however, some patients demonstrated dramatic increase in flow. The change in blood flow was highly correlated with the resting plasma renin activity (r = 0.939 P less than 0.001). The change in coronary vascular resistance and myocardial oxygen consumption were likewise related to the resting plasma renin level. Converting enzyme inhibition produces significant systemic hemodynamic changes in normal patients which implies that the renin-angiotensin system is important in normal cardiovascular homeostasis. The direct relationship between plasma renin activity and coronary blood flow suggests that the renin-angiotensin system may play an important role in coronary vasomotor regulation.", 
    "292": "Nifedipine was given to 15 patients with essential hypertension for 6 weeks and to 8 normotensive subjects for 5 days. In the hypertensives, 30 min after the first dose of nifedipine (5-mg capsule), there was a 13.9% fall in mean blood pressure (p less than 0.001), and, at the 6th week of treatment at the maximum dose of 20 mg t.d.s., a 20.6% fall in mean blood pressure (p less than 0.001). In the normotensive subjects, 30 min after the first dose of 5 mg of nifedipine, there was a 2.3% fall in mean blood pressure (NS), and on the 5th day with the maximum dose of 20 mg t.d.s., the fall was 2.2% (NS). In view of the difference in age between these normotensive and hypertensive subjects, a larger group of patients with essential hypertension and older normotensive subjects were also studied acutely after a single 5-mg capsule of nifedipine. Thirty minutes after the first dose of nifedipine in the larger group of hypertensives, there was a significant fall in mean blood pressure (10.4%; p less than 0.001, n = 33). In the normotensive subjects, there was also a significant fall in mean blood pressure (4.7%; p less than 0.01, n = 29). This was significantly less than in the hypertensives (p less than 0.001). In both the normotensive and hypertensive subjects, there was a significant correlation between pretreatment blood pressure and percentage decrease in blood pressure with nifedipine. Nifedipine, therefore, has a greater blood pressure-lowering effect the higher the initial blood pressure. This finding is compatible with the idea that nifedipine reveals a functional abnormality of vascular smooth muscle that becomes greater the higher the blood pressure.", 
    "293": "1. The effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition (CEI) using an intravenous infusion of either SQ 14 225 or MK 422 on blood pressure, plasma renin concentration, blood aldosterone concentration and urinary Na excretion, were studied in sodium-restricted sheep. 2. After 7 days of infusion of either drug mean arterial pressure had decreased and plasma renin concentration had increased. 3. Urinary sodium excretion and blood aldosterone concentration were not altered by infusion of either compound. 4. This study confirms a role for angiotensin II in the control of blood pressure in the Na-restricted sheep but suggests that urinary Na excretion in the sheep is not as dependent on angiotensin II as has been reported in other species.", 
    "294": "1. Substantial but circumstantial evidence has suggested an important role for angiotensin in the control of renal perfusion and function. A local, intrarenal action may have been angiotensin's first role in phylogeny, additional actions on the adrenal and the systemic vasculature having arisen later. 2. Converting enzyme inhibitors, both teprotide and captopril, induce a potentiated renal vascular response in patients with essential hypertension, associated with a consistent increase in sodium excretion and occasionally an increase in glomerular filtration rate. In patients with advanced congestive heart failure resistant to other vasodilators, a similar triad occurs. 3. It is not yet clear in which settings the renal response to converting enzyme inhibition reflects a reduction in angiotensin II formation thus implicating the reninangiotensin system in the pathogenesis; or an additional action, such as a potentiation of the local actions of bradykinin or enhanced prostaglandin formation. 4. Under some circumstances, especially where a qualitatively and quantitatively similar response occurs to angiotensin antagonists and converting enzyme inhibitors or where an angiotensin antagonist prevents an additional response to a converting enzyme inhibitor, the specific action of the converting enzyme inhibitor of angiotensin II formation is clearly responsible. Unfortunately, for most responses in animal models and all responses in patients such rigorous evidence is not yet available.", 
    "295": "1. The pressor responses to angiotensin I (AI) were suppressed in a dose related manner by the three converting enzyme inhibitors (CEI); SA 446, SQ 14 225 and MK 421. 2. The inhibitory action of SA 446 and SQ 14 225 was rapid in onset and decayed with time, while that of MK 421 was slower in onset and maintained for the 1 h of observation. 3. A single oral administration of MK 421 (80 mumol/kg) significantly decreased the pressor effect of AI 24 h later. In contrast, neither SA 446 nor SQ 14 225 reduced the AI-induced response at this time. 4. In anaesthetized genetically hypertensive rats, the depressor effect of MK 421 was greater than that of either SA 446 or SQ 14 225.", 
    "296": "1. In cats, under chloralose anaesthesia, captopril (0.1-0.3 mg/kg i.v.) inhibited the potentiation of the pressor effects of the ganglion stimulant McNeil-A-343 caused by intravenous infusion of angiotensin I (0.1 microgram/min). 2. In both cats and rats under chloralose anaesthesia captopril (0.01-1.0 mg/kg i.v.) depressed pressor responses to McNeil-A-343 whilst not modifying those to bilateral occlusion of the carotid arteries, or intravenous injection of the ganglion stimulant dimethylphenylpiperazinium or adrenaline. 3. It is concluded that in the cat and rat captopril depresses cardiovascular responses to sympathetic postganglionic nerve activation, both in the presence and absence of exogenous angiotensin I by an action which is proximal to the terminal synapse.", 
    "297": "Animal data suggest that angiotensin II may directly affect renal sodium retention independent of aldosterone (4,6). Additionally there is evidence to suggest that the hormone can stimulate protein synthesis in a variety of tissues and that indeed it may be a vasculotoxin (5,7). We describe here experiments designed to elucidate the role of angiotensin II in renal sodium retention in normal man. Additionally we present preliminary evidence suggesting that unlike the rapid sodium retaining effect, some delayed (trophic) actions of the hormone may be generated by a hitherto unappreciated mechanism.", 
    "298": "Serum angiotensin conversion enzyme (serum ACE) is a dipeptidylcarboxypeptidase which activates angiotensin I to angiotensin II and inactivates bradykinine. It is a glycoprotein with an MW of 126,000 to 480,000. It is produced by all endothelial cells, and is located on the cell membrane. It is inhibited by EDTA (chelator of Zn-- cofactor), teprotide (snake venom nonapeptide) and captopril. Estimation of ACE has greatly benefitted from the use of synthetic tripeptides. An example is the method of Cushman and Cheung using hippuryl histidyl leucine. A raised serum ACE level in sarcoidosis has been demonstrated by Liebermann in 1975. The diagnostic value is limited by the existence of high levels in other pulmonary diseases (asbestosis, silicosis). Serum ACE levels in sarcoidosis are all higher when the disease is diffuse from a pulmonary and extrapulmonary standpoint. They decrease when the disease regresses spontaneously and rise if it worsens. Radiological improvement in pulmonary sarcoid lesions under the influence of corticosteroid therapy is accompanied by a fall in serum ACE levels. Persistence of this normalization as the dose is decreased is a favourable sign, whilst the reappearance of a high serum level may either reflect simple and isolated biological \"rebound\" or may accompany a recurrence of signs of the disease. Serum ACE measurement is thus an important factor in the surveillance of cases of treated sarcoidosis when the dose of corticosteroids is to be reduced.", 
    "299": "The hemodynamic and plasma catecholamine responses to isometric exercise and head up tilt were investigated in normotensive and hypertensive subjects during normal and low sodium intake and before and during the administration of the converting enzyme inhibitors teprotide or captopril. Although teprotide and captopril decreased significantly the mean arterial pressure during both sodium intakes the normal pattern of hemodynamic response to hand grip and head up tilt was preserved. Moreover changes of plasma catecholamines during hand grip and head up tilt were not affected either by teprotide or captopril. When following the administration of teprotide or captopril fainting occurred either in the seated position or during head up tilt it was associated not only with a decrease in arterial pressure but also with a concurrent reduction in cardiac output and/or hypovolemia. It is concluded that converting enzyme inhibition does not impair significantly the cardiovascular responses which are mediated via the sympathetic nervous system either in normotensive or in hypertensive subjects.", 
    "300": "Angiotensin is known to facilitate the activity of the sympathetic nervous system, and the purpose of the present study was to investigate the possibility that angiotensin converting enzymes (ACE) inhibitors may interfere with neurogenic vasoconstriction by interfering with this interaction between angiotensin and the nervous system. In a pithed rat preparation the vasoconstrictor responses to both nerve stimulation (1-30 Hz) and exogenous noradrenaline (10-500 ng) were reduced by the ACE inhibitors captopril (0.1 and 1 mg/kg) and SQ20881 (10 mg/kg), and by the angiotensin II antagonist [Sar1 Ala8]angiotensin II (4 micrograms/kg/min). Angiotensin II infusion reversed the inhibition caused by captopril, and bradykinin infusion (1 microgram/kg/min) had no effect on responses to either nerve stimulation or noradrenaline. In rats that had been bilaterally nephrectomized 18-24 h previously, [Sar1, Ala8]angiotensin II was without any effect on responses to either nerve stimulation or noradrenaline, while captopril was without effect on responses to nerve stimulation but still had a small effect in reducing responses to noradrenaline. These results show that ACE inhibitors interfere with neurogenic vasoconstriction by an angiotensin-dependent mechanism. ACE inhibitors could thus lower blood pressure by two separate angiotensin-dependent mechanisms--first by interfering with neurogenic vasoconstriction as outlined above, and second, by blocking the direct vasoconstrictor action of angiotensin II.", 
    "301": "There are several approaches for interfering with the renin-angiotensin system. Antibodies against renin and angiotensins I and II (AI and AII) have not been consistently successful in the past, probably because of nonspecific effects; however, recent purification of renin now makes this approach more promising. Renin inhibitors include pepstatin and analogs, lipids and phospholipids, and renin-substrate analogs. Pepstatin and analogs are the most potent and specific but they are not orally active. The phospholipids are the most effective in vivo but their specificity is yet to be established. Renin-substrate analogs have been developed that have biologically significant effects but are not orally active. Some of the most potent and specific agents available for interfering with the renin-angiotensin system are the AII receptor antagonists. While these compounds effectively prevent the actions of AII, they suffer from several severe deficiencies: partial agonist activity, short duration of action, and lack of oral activity. The recent development of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors that are orally active has provided the greatest degree of clinical success for inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system and, consequently, the impetus to develop still better compounds. Captopril (SQ 14,225) is the prototype ACE inhibitor, being highly potent and specific with no other demonstrated pharmacological activity. Captopril is effective in all forms of human and animal models of hypertension except mineralocorticoid hypertension, which requires concomitant diuretic therapy. Because ACE is the same enzyme as kininase II, the enzyme that degrades kinins, the possibility exists that kinins are involved in the cardiovascular action of captopril, although this prospect is unlikely.", 
    "302": "Clearance and micropuncture experiments were performed to evaluate the influence of converting enzyme inhibition (CEI) (SQ 14,225) on renal hemodynamics, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), segmental vascular resistances, and superficial nephron function in anesthetized sodium restricted dogs. In one series (n = 8), renal blood flow (RBF) and GFR exhibited a high degree of autoregulatory efficiency when renal arterial pressure (RAP) was reduced from 126 +/- 5 to 86 +/- 1 mm Hg. With RAP maintained at the reduced level, CEI elicited increases in RBF (3.9 +/- 0.3 to 5.8 +/- 0.5 ml/min per g kw) and GFR (0.81 +/- 0.03 to 0.94 +/- 0.04 ml/min per g kw). With return of RAP to spontaneous levels during continued CEI, RBF and GFR autoregulatory efficiency was maintained, and was similar to that observed in control dogs subjected to the same procedures (n = 5). In the micropuncture experiments (n = 12), RAP was maintained at the reduced level (87.5 +/- .9 mm Hg), and measurements were made before and during CEI. Proximal tubule pressure, peritubular capillary pressure, stop flow pressure, and single nephron GFR (SNGFR) increased significantly. Regression analysis suggested that the increases in SNGFR were associated with small increases in the filtration coefficient. CEI reduced preglomerular resistance by 29% to 35% and efferent arteriolar resistance by 24% to 32%. These results indicate that the increased activity of the renin-angiotensin system that occurs during salt restriction exerts approximately equivalent vasoconstrictor influences on both preglomerular and postglomerular vascular resistance elements.", 
    "303": "In six inbred dogs with neonatally-induced coarctation hypertension, and in seven littermate controls, acute responses of proximal arterial pressure and plasma renin activity (PRA) to converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI; SQ 20,881, 0.5 mg/kg i.v.) were serially examined. Studies were performed at 2, 6, and 12 months post-aortic banding under sodium-replete and -deplete conditions. Both in normotensive controls and in coarcted dogs, depressor responses (pre- minus post-CEI values) were positively correlated, not only with initial (pre-CEI) PRA, but also independently with initial blood pressure. Although absolute depressor responses in coarcted dogs exceeded those of the control group, there were no significant group differences when, by analysis of covariance, depressor responses were adjusted for the physiologic influence of initial pressure. Similarly, depressor responses expressed as a percent of initial pressure were comparable in coarcted and control groups. Initial PRA and PRA response to CEI in coarcted dogs were also comparable to control dogs; the PRA response correlated with initial PRA in both groups. CEI did not significantly diminish the magnitude of blood-pressure difference between coarcted and control dogs. Thus, in neonatally-induced coarctation hypertension, under both sodium replete- and -deplete conditions: 1) acute depressor and PRA responses to CEI are modulated by the same factors that influence responses of normotensive controls; 2) larger absolute depressor responses to CEI appear to be a physiologic function of higher initial pressure; and 3) blood pressure excess over littermate controls is largely sustained by CEI-resistant factors, potentially including the known volume excess in coarcted dogs.", 
    "304": "Pure kallikrein and bradykinin, when added to the perfusion medium of the isolated perfused rat lung, produced an equal inhibition in the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II as measured in the venous return superfused over the rabbit aortic strips. Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) prevented the inhibitory effect of kallikrein and bradykinin. Aprotinin, however, prevented the inhibitory effect of kallikrein without altering that of bradykinin. The recovery brought about by ASA of the bradykinin-produced inhibition of angiotensin I conversion was also prevented by prior addition of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) into the perfusion medium. Neither kallikrein and bradykinin nor ASA altered the myotropic activity of angiotensin II. 5-Oxo-L-prolyl L-tryptophyl-L-prolyl-L-arginyl-L-prolyl-L-glutaminyl-L-isoleucyl-L-prolyl-L- proline (SQ 20 881), when added to the medium, greatly reduced the responses to angiotensin I but potentiated those of angiotensin II. The possible mechanisms of the inhibitory effects of kallikrein and bradykinin are discussed.", 
    "305": "1. Lower-body negative pressure (LBNP) was used to stimulate sympathetic reflexes in anaesthetized cats. At -50 mmHg for 10 min it caused transient reduction in central venous pressure and systemic arterial blood pressure. Arterial blood pressure was then restored within 30 s and there was a tachycardia. Central venous pressure showed only partial recovery. The resting level of plasma renin activity (PRA; 2.9-3.2 ng h-1 ml-1) did not change until approximately 5 min into the manoeuvre. 2. When converting-enzyme inhibitor (CEI) was given 75 s after the onset of suction it caused a greater and more sustained fall in arterial blood pressure than when administered alone. The angiotensin II (ANG II) antagonist [Sar1,Ala8] ANG II produced similar effects after a short-lived pressor response. 3. This prolonged fall in arterial blood pressure produced by CEI was not associated with reduced sympathetic efferent nerve activity. This indicates that the inhibitor affects one of the peripheral actions of angiotensin and in so doing produces vasodilatation of neurogenic origin. 4. These findings suggest that angiotensin, at a level which does not exert a direct vasoconstrictor action, interacts with the sympathetic nervous system to maintain arterial blood pressure when homeostatic reflexes are activated. A reduction in the efficiency of these reflexes by CEI may contribute to its hypotensive effect.", 
    "306": "Increased sympathetic nervous system activity has been demonstrated in established one-kidney one-clip hypertension in the rat. We have found that renal denervation in this model results in an attenuation of hypertension, unassociated with alterations in sodium or water balance or renin activity. To determine whether the depressor effect of renal denervation is associated with changes in peripheral sympathetic nervous system activity, sham operation (n = 12), renal denervation (n = 13), or unclipping (n = 13) was carried out 2 wk after the onset of one-kidney one-clip hypertension. Normotensive unine-phrectomized age- and sex-matched rats were used as controls (n = 14). Renal denervation resulted in a significant decrease in systolic blood pressure (201+/-7 to 151+/-6 mm Hg), while unclipping lowered systolic blood pressure to normotensive levels (130+/-6 mm Hg). 8 d after operation plasma norepinephrine and mean arterial pressure before and after ganglionic blockade with 30 mg/kg hexamethonium bromide were measured in conscious, unrestrained, resting animals, as indices of peripheral sympathetic nervous system activity. Plasma norepinephrine was significantly higher in hypertensive sham-operated rats (422+/-42 pg/ml) compared with normotensive controls (282+/-25 pg/ml) (P < 0.01). Both renal denervation and unclipping restored plasma norepinephrine to normal levels (273+/-22 and 294+/-24 pg/ml, respectively). Ganglionic blockade in hypertensive sham-operated animals resulted in a significantly greater decrease in mean arterial pressure than occurred in renal denervated, unclipped, or control rats. The data suggest that the depressor effect of renal denervation or unclipping in the one-kidney one-clip hypertensive rat is associated with a decrease in peripheral sympathetic nervous system activity.", 
    "307": "In addition to their effect on angiotensin and bradykinin metabolism, converting enzyme inhibitors (CEI) may also alter prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. We therefore examined two CEI, SQ 14,225 (captopril) and SQ 20,881, for their in vitro effect on PG synthesis by glomeruli and aortic strips from rats. Glomeruli incubated in test tubes produced predominantly PGE2 and PGF2 alpha. Both CEI selectively stimulated PGE2 synthesis with maximal effects at 25 microM. During superfusion of glomeruli with captopril (25 microM) synthesis of PGE2 increased 5- to 10-fold and that of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha doubled. No significant change in PGF2 alpha or thromboxane B2 occurred. This effect of CEI was independent of angiotensin or bradykinin. In contrast captopril had no effect on PG synthesis by aortic strips, which produced predominantly prostacyclin assayed as 6-keto-PGR1 alpha and little PGE2 and PGF2 alpha. These results demonstrate that CEI can directly stimulate PG synthesis in glomeruli. This additional mechanism of action of CEI may require reinterpretation of the role of angiotensin based on results obtained with CEI.", 
    "308": "The renin-angiotensin system was studied in 14 normotensive and hypertensive patients with scleroderma and polyarteritis nodosa (PAN). The variations in blood pressure, plasma renin activity (PRA) and serum aldosterone were compared after the Captopril test. Mean arterial pressure fell 15,7 +/- 2,6 p. 100 (p less than 0,01) in hypertensive patients, but no change was observed in normotensive subjects. PRA and serum aldosterone did not change significantly in hypertensives with scleroderma. Large variations in blood pressure, PRA and serum aldosterone were observed in 2 out of 3 patients with PAN, the third one presenting a fall in blood pressure without significant changes in PRA or serum aldosterone. These results suggest that other mechanisms are responsible for hypertension in these patients and that the Captopril acted on other factors than the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "309": "N-[1-(S)-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl]-L-alanyl-L-proline (MK-422), is a potent angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, but as a diacid is poorly absorbed in laboratory animals. Enalapril maleate, the monoethyl ester of MK-422, proved to be significantly better absorbed in both rats and dogs. Peak levels of radioactivity in plasma occurred in 30 min in rats and 2 hr in dogs after a single dose of 14C-enalapril maleate (1 mg/kg, po). Rats excreted 26% of the dose in the urine and 72% in the feces in 72 hr; dogs excreted 40% of the dose in the urine and 36% in the feces. After the intravenous dose, the presence of radioactivity in the feces of both species suggested that some biliary excretion had occurred. Absorption was estimated to be 34% in the rat and 61% in the dog. The major metabolite of enalapril maleate in dogs, accounting for 86% of the urine radioactivity, was identified as MK-422 by GC/MS. A procedure was developed for the quantitation of MK-422 and enalapril in plasma and urine by their inhibition of purified ACE. The assays showed that enalapril was absorbed intact in dogs and converted to MK-422 after absorption.", 
    "310": "The degradation of des-Arg9-brady kinin and its analogues by highly purified preparations of hog lung and kidney kininase II (angiotensin-converting enzyme; peptidyldipeptide hydrolase, EC 3.4.15.1) was studied. The degradative peptides fragments were separated and isolated by high performance liquid chromatography and identified by amino acid analysis. Both enzymes released C-terminal tripeptides from des-Arg9-bradykinin, des-Arg9-(Leu8)-bradykinin, Pro-Pro-Gly-Phe-Ser-Pro-Phe, Pro-Gly-Phe-Ser-Pro-Phe, Gly-Phe-Ser-Pro-Phe, Bz-Gly-Ser-pro-Phe and Bz-Gly-Ala-Pro-Phe. Hydrolysis of Phe-Ser-Pro-Phe, Bz-Gly-His-Pro-Phe, Bz-Gly-Phe-Pro-Phe and Bz-Gly-Gly-Pro-Phe by both enzymes was negligible. These data indicate that kininase II can release C-terminal tripeptides of substrates having a proline residue in the penultimate position such as des-Arg9-bradykinin and its analogues, and that this enzyme is able not only to act as a dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase but also acts as a tripeptidyl carboxy-peptidase. The tripeptidyl carboxypeptidase enzyme was sensitive to inhibition by kininase II inhibitors.", 
    "311": "Captopril was administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and the acute and long-term effects on the urinary excretion of Na, K, prostaglandin (PG)E2 and PGF2 alpha were studied. Captopril (30 mg and 100 mg/kg p.o.) increased urine volume, urinary Na and K excretion on the 1st and 2nd days of its administration. The urinary K/Na ratio was decreased in the captopril-treated groups on the 1st to 3rd day. Urinary PGE2 excretion in the captopril 100 mg/kg group was significantly increased compared to that in the control group (210.6 +/- 31.4 vs. control 123.2 +/- 8.4 ng/day) on the 1st day of captopril administration. A slight but significant increase in urinary PGF2 alpha excretion was also seen in the captopril 100 mg/kg group (105.2 +/- 9.8 vs. control 75.8 +/- 2.1 ng/day). But PG excretion declined during prolonged treatment and these were no significant difference between the control and captopril-treated groups on the 3rd and 6th week. These data suggest that captopril increases renal PG only as an acute phase and that the increase of PG at least partly accounts for natriuretic affects of the agent.", 
    "312": "The exact mechanism of action of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in reducing blood pressure is not known, although inhibition of angiotensin II formation is the generally accepted mechanism. Experiments were performed in two models of experimental hypertension to determine whether or not inhibition of the pressor response to angiotensin I, 300 ng/kg i.v., would correlate with the antihypertensive response to single oral doses of N-[(S)-1-(ethoxycarbonyl)-3-phenylpropyl]-L-Ala-L-Pro (MK-421), a new ACE inhibitor. Captopril, given as a single oral dose, was studied in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) for comparative purposes. In SHR, MK-421 at 0.1-3 mg/kg p.o. and captopril at 0.1-3 mg/kg p.o. were approximately equipotent with regard to inhibiting the pressor response to angiotensin I (relative potency=1.7; 95% C.I.=0.7-4.5). The magnitude of ACE inhibition and onset of action were similar with both agents, but MK-421 had a longer duration of action. The decrement in systolic pressure following each ACE inhibitor consisted of an initial decrease in blood pressure corresponding to the maximal inhibition of angiotensin I pressor response and a secondary fall in blood pressure which was evident 5-6 h after treatment. At this time, the inhibition of the pressor response to angiotensin I was minimal. Thus, the time course for blockade of angiotensin I and the blood pressure reduction did not correspond. The dose-response regression lines for the antihypertensive effect of each inhibitor, unlike those for ACE inhibition, were flat. The potency ratio computed on the basis of the maximum fall in blood pressure over 6 h revealed that MK-421 was 11.5 times (P less than 0.05) more potent thant captopril. In 2-kidney Grollman renal hypertensive rats (RHR), MK-421 at 0.3-10 mg/kg p.o. inhibited the pressor response to angiotensin I by 65-95%, but produced significant decrements in blood pressure only at 10 mg/kg p.o. The finding that MK-421 was more potent than captopril in lowering blood pressure in SHR, yet equally active in its ability to block angiotensin I pressor responses, suggests that a mechanism(s) other than inhibition of plasma ACE is involved in the decrease in blood pressure was not reduced. However, a higher dose which produced a similar degree of blockade was associated with a significant decrease in blood pressure.", 
    "313": "Twenty patients with severe arterial hypertension were treated with Captopril (an inhibitor of angiotensin 1 converting enzyme). Decrease in blood pressure occurred early and was sometimes important. Significant changes in plasma renin activity, plasma aldosterone and converting enzyme activity were observed. There was a significant inverse correlation between the action of Captopril on blood pressure and the level of extra-cellular volumes. Eighteen patients received long-term treatment (m = 10.05 +/- 1.32 mo.). Side-effects consisted of positive antinuclear antibodies and a possible kidney failure in cases with stenosis of the renal artery.", 
    "314": "The plasma concentration of aldosterone was followed in seven hypertensive patients before and during long-term angiotensin II suppression with the orally active angiotensin-I-converting-enzyme inhibitor, captopril. The plasma concentration of aldosterone decreased initially from 74 to 21 pg/ml (P less than 0.05) after 1 month of administration of captopril. Thereafter the plasma concentration of aldosterone began to rise and after 1 year reached a level of 165 pg/ml. During long-term captopril therapy the plasma renin activity remained increased and the plasma angiotensin II concentration suppressed. The mechanism responsible for the late rise of the plasma concentration of aldosterone during long-term angiotensin II suppression with captopril remains to be elucidated. A sizeable and lasting hypotensive effect was observed in all patients.", 
    "315": "1. With a double-blind cross-over protocol, 20 hypertensive captopril-treated patients were studied by adding in a variable sequence a placebo and propranolol (80 mg three times a day) to their captopril regimen (200 mg three times a day), during periods each lasting 1 month. During captopril--placebo treatment their diastolic blood pressure remained elevated between 90 and 114 mmHg. 2. The additional administration of propranolol produced a significant hypotensive effect, but no alterations of the plasma angiotensin II and aldosterone concentrations and of the urinary aldosterone excretion occurred. The present data indicate that in captopril-treated patients the hypotensive effect of propranolol is achieved independently of changes in the plasma angiotensin II and aldosterone concentration. 3. The additional administration of propranolol also produced an increase in the serum potassium levels in the absence of any change in plasma aldosterone concentration or in the urinary aldosterone excretion.", 
    "316": "1. Patients with idiopathic hyperaldosteronism (IHA) show a response of aldosterone to posture which is not present in patients with aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA). We have determined whether this could be explained by a different sensitivity to angiotensin II. 2. Angiotensin II was infused in gradually increasing doses in six patients with APA and in seven patients with IHA. No changes in aldosterone concentration were found at the end of each period in APA, whereas there was a significant increase in IHA; blood pressure rose by a similar extent in both groups. 3. In order to evaluate the role of endogenous angiotensin II, captopril, a converting enzyme inhibitor, was administered to six patients with APA and five patients with IHA at a dose of 75 mg/day for 1 week. There was a significant fall of mean blood pressure in IHA and only minimal changes in APA. Plasma renin activity and plasma in urinary aldosterone were unchanged in APA. In IHA there was a small increase in upright plasma renin activity and a slight decrease in both plasma and urinary aldosterone, but these changes were not significant. 4. These findings further support the idea that idiopathic hyperaldosteronism is a clinical state different from that occurring in primary aldosteronism due to adenoma, and may be more closely related to essential hypertension.", 
    "317": "The clearance of Captopril (SQ 14225) was examined in six hemodialysis patients, using a newly developed method for the determination of Captopril in blood. At 30 minutes after the start of hemodialysis, the clearance of Captopril was 80 +/- 14.2 ml/min, whereas that of creatinine was 123.4 +/- 8.8 ml/min and that of BUN was 144.1 +/- 7.2 ml/min. The blood concentration of Captopril was found to be lower when taken in a postprandial state than in a fasting state.", 
    "318": "The objective of this study was to examine the roles of the blockade of formation of angiotensin II and prostaglandins in the renal vasodilator effect of captopril in conscious salt-replete dogs. Blood pressure was recorded from an indwelling catheter and renal blood flow (RBF) was measured with an electromagnetic flowmeter and an implanted flow probe. Plasma renin activity was measured by radioimmunoassay. The effect of captopril (0.2 mg/kg i.v.) on RBF was compared in dogs given either saralasin (0.5 micrograms/kg min i.a.) or indomethacin (5mg/kg i.v.) with that in dogs given saline vehicle. Control plasma renin activity in these groups of animals before drug treatment ranged from 0.74 to 1.18 ng of angiotensin 1 per ml/hr. Captopril decreased blood pressure from 102 +/- 4 to 92 +/- 4 mm Hg (P less than .01) and increased RBF from 278 +/- 23 to 345 +/- 29 ml/min (25%) (P less than .01) in saline vehicle-treated animals. In the presence of intrarenal infusion of saralasin, captopril did not increase RBF but decreased blood pressure slightly. Captopril still increased RBF by 18% in indomethacin-treated dogs. These results suggest that the renal vasodilator effect of captopril in conscious salt-replete dogs is mainly due to the blockade of angiotensin II formation. Furthermore, the renin-angiotensin system appears to have an influence on renal vascular tone even under these basal conditions.", 
    "319": "Plasma concentrations and urinary excretion rate of vasopressin (VP) were examined in ten cases of severe hypertension before and during short-term treatment by Captopril (SQ 14225). Before Captopril, plasma and urinary VP were high (respectively 5.24 pmol/l and 68 pmol/day) and positively correlated to plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma aldosterone (PA). The decline in blood pressure (mean -15%) after Captopril was correlated not only to initial PRA and PA values, but also to plasma (r = 0.89; P less than 0.001) and urinary (r = 0.78; P less than 0.01) VP values. The initial dose of Captopril (1 mg/kg) induced a rapid decrease in blood pressure whereas plasma VP did not rise and aldosterone decreased. At the eighth day of Captopril treatment (mean daily dose 6 +/- 1.5 mg/kg) the drop in blood pressure (-12%) and in aldosterone persisted together with a significant reduction in plasma (1.18 pmol/l; P less than 0.01) and urinary (25 pmol/day; P less than 0.01) VP. It is suggested that these sustained simultaneous reductions in the rates of secretion of vasopressin and aldosterone are both elements of the antihypertensive effect of Captopril.", 
    "320": "1 The new converting enzyme inhibitor RHC 3659 was tested in 15 male volunteers. The study consisted of two parts: first, the ability of a single oral dose (5, 10, 20, 40 or 80 mg) to inhibit the pressor response to exogenous angiotensin I was tested with blood pressure and heart rate monitored continuously through an intraarterial catheter. A dose-related shift to the right of the pressor response curve to angiotensin I was observed with a peak occurring within 0.5 to 1 h. The pressor response to angiotensin II was unaffected. 2 In the second part, plasma renin and converting enzyme activity, angiotensin II and aldosterone were measured serially before and up to 8 h after administration of a single oral dose of RHC 3659. As expected. plasma angiotensin II and aldosterone fell within 30 min while plasma renin activity increased. Plasma converting enzyme activity was suppressed at 0.5 h in a dose-related manner with levels still below 30% of control 4 h following 80 mg of the inhibitor. 3 However, in vitro the enzyme-inhibitor complex seemed quited fragile since during storage of the plasma samples at -20 degrees C, converting enzyme activity increased significantly already within days (P less than 0.001, n = 28) and continued to rise for more than 2 months. This fragility may explain the seemingly lower potency of RHC 3659 when compared to captopril. No side effects were observed.", 
    "321": "Thirty four beagle dogs, male and female were orally given 10, 30, 100 and 200 mg/kg/day of captopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, for 3 months followed by a recovery test for 4 weeks. One of 4 female dogs which were treated with the highest dose of 200 mg/kg/day throughout the experimental period died of bronchial pneumonia. Hypersalivation and occasionally vomiting was observed in dogs treated with 100 and 200 mg/kg/day. Skin eruption such as erythema and papules was observed mostly at the ventral surface of the neck, chest and upper abdomen in dogs in these two experimental groups. Histological examination of the lesion revealed cellular infiltration with edema and expansion in the dermis and slight hyperkeratosis with parakeratosis and acanthosis. Changes in erythrocyte counts, hematocrit values and hemoglobin contents during the course of administration were variable among dogs but these were obvious in animals treated with higher doses. An increase in erythropoiesis of the bone marrow, extramedullary hematopoiesis and slight hemosiderosis in liver and spleen were revealed by histological examination. Above histological observations suggest that captopril may cause hemolysis. Hypertrophy and hyperplasia of juxtaglomerular cells with increased number of JG granules were shown in the highest dosage group even 4 weeks after suspension of captopril administration. A distinct plasma renin activity supported the morphological changes. From the results of three months administration of captopril to beagle dogs, the maximum non-toxic dose may be around 10 mg/kg/day and toxic dose 100 mg/kg/day."
