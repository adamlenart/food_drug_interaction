The effect of ARBs on in-hospital mortality and 12-month MACE occurrence was assessed using matched logistic and Cox regression models. Compared with ACEIs, ARBs significantly reduced in-hospital mortality(1.3% vs. 3.3%; hazard ratio [HR], 0.379; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.190 to0.756; p = 0.006) and 12-month MACE occurrence (4.6% vs. 6.9%; HR, 0.661; 95% CI, 0.457 to 0.956; p = 0.028).

We have shown that, in human microvascular endothelial cells, 20-HETE increases angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) mRNA, protein, and ACE activity via an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/tyrosine kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/inhibitor of \u03baB kinase (IKK)\u03b2-mediated signaling pathway. In this work, we show that, similar to epidermal growth factor (EGF), 20-HETE (10 nM) activates EGFR by stimulating tyrosine phosphorylation; however, unlike 20-HETE, EGF does not induce ACE expression, and pretreatment with a neutralizing antibody against EGF does not prevent the 20-HETE-mediated ACE induction. Inhibition of nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) activation prevented the 4.58-fold (\u00b10.78; P < 0.05) 20-HETE-mediated induction of ACE. The 20-HETE increased NF-\u03baB-binding activity in nuclear extracts and the activity of both the somatic and germinal ACE promoters by 4.37-fold (\u00b10.18; P < 0.05) and 2.53-fold (\u00b1 0.24; P < 0.05), respectively. The 20-HETE-stimulated ACE promoter activity was abrogated by the 20-HETE antagonist 20-hydroxy-6,15-eicosadienoic acid and by inhibitors of EGFR, MAPK, IKK\u03b2, and NF-\u03baB activation. Sequence analysis demonstrated the presence of two and one putative NF-\u03baB binding sites on the human somatic and germinal ACE promoters, respectively. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay indicated that 20-HETE stimulates the translocation and subsequent binding of NF-\u03baB to each of the putative binding sites (S1, 3.43 \u00b1 0.3-fold enrichment versus vehicle; S2, 3.72 \u00b1 0.68-fold enrichment versus vehicle; S3, 3.20 \u00b1 0.18-fold enrichment versus vehicle; P < 0.05). This is the first study to identify NF-\u03baB as a transcriptional factor for ACE and to implicate a distinct EGFR/MAPK/IKK/NF-\u03baB signaling cascade underlying 20-HETE-mediated transcriptional activation of ACE mRNA and stimulation of ACE activity.", 
    "5": "With increasing life expectancy, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other types of age-associated dementia are on the rise worldwide. Treatment approaches for dementia are insufficient and novel therapies are not readily available. In this context repurposing of established drugs appears attractive. A well-established class of cardiovascular drugs, which targets the angiotensin II system, is such a candidate, which currently undergoes a paradigm shift with regard to the potential benefit for treatment of neurodegenerative symptoms. In search for additional evidence, we subjected aged rats to chronic unpredictable mild stress, which is known to enhance the development of AD-related neuropathological features. We report here that four weeks of chronic mild stress induced a strong upregulation of the hippocampal angiotensin-converting enzyme (Ace) at gene expression and protein level. Concomitantly, tau protein hyperphosphorylation developed. Signs of neurodegeneration were detected by the significant downregulation of neuronal structure proteins such as microtubule-associated protein 2 (Map2) and synuclein-gamma (Sncg). Ace was involved in neurodegenerative symptoms because treatment with the brain-penetrating ACE inhibitor, captopril, retarded tau hyperphosphorylation and signs of neurodegeneration. Moreover, ACE inhibitor treatment could counteract glutamate neurotoxicity by preventing the downregulation of glutamate decarboxylase 2 (Gad2). Taken together, ACE inhibition targets neurodegeneration triggered by environmental stress.",

Chest pain in the absence of epicardial CAD is a common entity. Angina caused by CMD, microvascular angina (MVA), is often indistinguishable from that caused by obstructive epicardial CAD. The recent emergence of noninvasive techniques that can identify CMD, such as stress positron-emission tomography (PET) and cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) myocardial perfusion imaging, allow improved identification of MVA. Using these tools, higher risk patients with MVA can be differentiated from those at lower risk in the heterogeneous population historically labeled as cardiac syndrome X. Likewise, MVA can be diagnosed in those with obstructive epicardial CAD who have persistent angina despite successful revascularization. There is little evidence to support current treatment strategies for MVA and current literature has not clearly defined CMD or whether therapy improves prognosis.",

In this study, the antioxidant and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activities of peptides isolated and purified from egg yolk protein were investigated. Defatted egg yolk was hydrolyzed using pepsin and pancreatin and sequentially fractionated by ultrafiltration, followed by gel filtration to produce egg yolk gel filtration fractions (EYGF). Of these, two fractions, EYGF-23 and EYGF-33, effectively inhibited the peroxides and thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) in an oxidizing linoleic acid model system. The antioxidant mechanism involved superoxide anion and hydroxyl radicals scavenging and ferrous chelation. The presence of hydrophobic amino acids such as tyrosine (Y) and tryptophan (W), in sequences identified by LC-MS as WYGPD (EYGF-23) and KLSDW (EYGF-33), contributed to the antioxidant activity and were not significantly different from the synthetic BHA antioxidant. A third fraction (EYGF-56) was also purified from egg yolk protein by gel filtration and exhibited high ACE inhibitory activity (69%) and IC50 value (3.35 mg/mL). The SDNRNQGY peptide (10 mg/mL) had ACE inhibitory activity, which was not significantly different from that of the positive control captopril (0.5 mg/mL). In addition, YPSPV in (EYGF-33) (10 mg/mL) had higher ACE inhibitory activity compared with captopril.

The alcalase hydrolysate showed the highest ACE inhibitory activity (69.8%) after 8 h of hydrolysis while the highest anti-oxidative activities measured by 2,2-diphenyl 1-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging (DPPH) (56.00%) and ferrous ion-chelating (FIC) (59.00%) methods were exhibited after 24 h and 8 h of hydrolysis, respectively. The ACE-inhibitory and anti-oxidative activities displayed dose-dependent trends, and increased with increasing protein hydrolysate concentrations. Moreover, strong positive correlations between angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory and anti-oxidative activities were also observed. This study indicates that A. lecanora hydrolysate can be exploited as a source of functional food owing to its anti-oxidant as well as anti-hypertension functions.",

Participants in the NLT group experienced a lower rate of all-cause hospital admissions (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.88, high-quality evidence) and fewer hospital admissions related to heart failure (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.72, moderate-quality evidence) compared to the usual-care group. Six studies (902 participants) examined all-cause mortality. All-cause mortality was also lower in the NLT group (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.92, moderate-quality evidence) compared to usual care. Approximately 27 deaths could be avoided for every 1000 people receiving NLT of beta-adrenergic blocking agents, ACEIs, and ARBs.

Participants in the NLT group were more likely to remain event free compared to participants in the usual-care group (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.77, moderate-quality evidence). Five studies (966 participants) reported on the number of participants reaching target dose of beta-adrenergic blocking agents. This was also higher in the NLT group compared to usual care (RR 1.99, 95% CI 1.61 to 2.47, low-quality evidence). However, there was a substantial degree of heterogeneity in this pooled analysis. We rated the risk of bias in these studies as high mainly due to a lack of clarity regarding incomplete outcome data, lack of reporting on adverse events associated with the intervention, and the inability to blind participants and personnel. Participants in the NLT group reached maximal dose of beta-adrenergic blocking agents in half the time compared with participants in usual care. Two studies reported on adverse events; one of these studies stated there were no adverse events, and the other study found one adverse event but did not specify the type or severity of the adverse event.",

Despite evidence of a dose-dependent relationship of beta-adrenergic blocking agents, ACEIs, and ARBs with improving outcomes in patients with HFrEF, the translation of this evidence into clinical practice is poor. NLT is one strategy that facilitates the implementation of this evidence into practice.", 
    "31": "Clinical and preclinical studies account hypertension as a risk factor for dementia. We reported earlier that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition attenuated the increased vulnerability to neurodegeneration in hypertension and prevented lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced memory impairment in normotensive wistar rats (NWRs) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Recently, a receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) has been reported to induce amyloid beta (A\u03b21-42) deposition and memory impairment in hypertensive animals. However, the involvement of ACE in RAGE activation and amyloidogenesis in the hypertensive state is still unexplored. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the role of ACE on RAGE activation and amyloidogenesis in memory-impaired NWRs and SHRs. Memory impairment was induced by repeated (on days 1, 4, 7, and 10) intracerebroventricular (ICV) injections of LPS in SHRs (25 \u03bcg) and NWRs (50 \u03bcg). Our data showed that SHRs exhibited increased oxidative stress (increased gp91-phox/NOX-2 expression and ROS generation), RAGE, and \u03b2-secretase (BACE) expression without A\u03b21-42 deposition. LPS (25 \u03bcg, ICV) further amplified oxidative stress, RAGE, and BACE activation, culminating in A\u03b21-42 deposition and memory impairment in SHRs. Similar changes were observed at the higher dose of LPS (50 \u03bcg, ICV) in NWRs. Further, LPS-induced oxidative stress was associated with endothelial dysfunction and reduction in cerebral blood flow (CBF), more prominently in SHRs than in NWRs. Finally, we showed that perindopril (0.1 mg/kg, 15 days) prevented memory impairment by reducing oxidative stress, RAGE activation, amyloidogenesis, and improved CBF in both SHRs and NWRs. These findings suggest that perindopril might be used as a therapeutic strategy for the early stage of dementia.",

    "37": "The purpose of this review is to summarize current data on the role of immunosuppressants in the pathogenesis of hypertension and the efficacy and tolerability of major antihypertensive classes in kidney transplant recipients. Arterial hypertension is a common complication after kidney transplantation and a major risk factor for adverse outcome and graft rejection due to blood pressure elevation by immunosuppressive medications. Calcineurin inhibitors induce hypertension by a mechanism related to the imbalance of vasoactive substances endothelin and nitric oxide, and probably by causing overactivity of thiazide-sensitive sodium-chloride-cotransporter. Corticosteroids are well known for their hypertensive effects. The interactions of calcineurin inhibitors and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor sirolimus also promote hypertension. Management of arterial hypertension is a complex problem in the care of kidney transplant recipients. Target blood pressure values of <130/80 mm Hg are suggested by the National Kidney Foundation/ Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative. Calcium channel blockers may be useful in antagonizing the vasoconstrictive effects of calcineurin inhibitors. The renin-angiotensin system inhibitors seem a good option, especially in patients with proteinuria, however their effects on long-term graft and patient survival are controversial. \u03b2-Blockers could be beneficial in patients with coronary heart disease, but caution is required due to metabolic adverse effects. Thiazide diuretics could be the reasonable option for patients with glomerular filtration rate \u226530 mL/min/1.73 m2, also with caution regarding hypokalemia and glycemia. Until more evidence is provided, the choice of optimal antihypertensive therapy in kidney transplant recipients should be based on previous individual antihypertensive tolerability and efficacy, comorbidities, concomitant medications and post-transplant kidney function.",

    "49": "\u03b3-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is one of the most important functional components in fermented foods because of its physiological functions, such as neurotransmission and antihypertensive activities. However, little is known about components other than GABA in GABA-rich fermented foods. A metabolomic approach offers an opportunity to discover bioactive and flavor components in fermented food. To find specific components in milk fermented with GABA-producing Lactococcus lactis 01-7, we compared the components found in GABA-rich fermented milk with those found in control milk fermented without GABA production using capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry. A principal component analysis score plot showed a clear differentiation between the control milk fermented with L. lactis 01-1, which does not produce GABA, and GABA-rich milk fermented with a combination of L. lactis strains 01-1 and 01-7. As expected, the amount of GABA in GABA-rich fermented milk was much higher (1,216-fold) than that of the control milk. Interestingly, the amount of Orn was also much higher (27-fold) than that of the control milk. Peptide analysis showed that levels of 6 putative angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory peptides were also higher in the GABA-rich fermented milk. Furthermore, ACE-inhibitory activity of GABA-rich fermented milk tended to be higher than that of the control milk. These results indicate that the GABA-producing strain 01-7 provides fermented milk with other functional components in addition to GABA.",

The present study aimed to explore the relationship between clinical trials and clinical practice. We analyzed data from patients enrolled in the \"Treatment with Azilsartan Compared to ACE-Inhibitors in Anti-Hypertensive Therapy\" (EARLY) registry comparing blood pressure (BP) effects of the angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) azilsartan medoxomil (AZL-M) with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor ramipril between patients who met the eligibility criteria of a previous RCT and those who did not.",

RCT- patients (55.5%) displayed a higher risk profile in terms of age and comorbidities, and a wider spectrum of BP values at baseline, as highlighted by the grades of hypertension and mean BP values. The proportion of patients who achieved target blood pressure control in the RCT+ group was significantly higher for AZL-M versus ramipril (64.1 versus 56.1%; P<0.01), in accordance with the result of the clinical trial. In the RCT- AZL-M group, the proportion of patients who met BP targets was lower (58.1%) than in the RCT+ AZL-M group (64.1%), whereas the proportion of patients with target BP values in the RCT- ramipril and the RCT+ ramipril groups was similar (57.7 versus 56.1%). Thus, in contrast to results for the RCT+ group, in the RCT- group, the target BP attainment rate for AZL-M was not significantly superior to that for ramipril. However, the tolerability profile of AZL-M and ramipril was comparable in both populations. At the 12-month follow-up, death and stroke rates were low (\u22640.5%) and adverse events did not differ between the AZL-M and ramipril groups, irrespective of RCT eligibility.",

This study was a secondary pooled analysis of two Phase III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of patients with mRCC: NCT00334282 comparing pazopanib to placebo and NCT00720941 comparing pazopanib to sunitinib. ASI users were defined as patients using an ASI at baseline. Association with overall survival (OS; primary outcome) and progression-free survival (PFS) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression. The association was adjusted in multivariable analysis for baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP), use of other antihypertensive drugs and prognostic factors comprising the Heng risk criteria for mRCC. Of 1,545 patients pooled from the two RCTs, 649 (42%) were using one or more antihypertensive drugs at baseline, 385 (59%) of which were using an ASI. In the multivariable analysis of patients using pazopanib or sunitinib, no significant association was observed between baseline ASI use and OS (hazard ratio [HR] 0.97 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80-1.18], p = 0.80) or PFS (HR 0.88 [95% CI 0.73-1.06], p = 0.17). Exploratory subgroup analysis of NCT00720941 highlighted that the effect of baseline ASI use on OS may differ between patients treated with sunitinib and pazopanib. In conclusion, use of ASIs at baseline was not a significant independent prognostic factor for improved survival in a pooled analysis of mRCC patients treated with pazopanib or sunitinib.",

The urine, serum, tibias and femurs from normal control mice and Captopril-treated (10mg/kg) mice were collected for biochemical, histological and molecular analyses after drug administration for eight weeks. The mice after the treatment with Captopril had a significant decrease of serum testosterone level. The histological measurements showed the loss of trabecular bone mass and trabecular bone number, and the breakage of trabecular bone network as well as the changes of chondrocyte zone at epiphyseal plate in Captopril-treated mice. The defect of Captopril on trabecular bone was reflected by the quantitative bio-parameters from micro-CT. The expression of renin receptor and bradykinin B2 receptor (B2R) was significantly up-regulated in tibia of mice upon to the Captopril treatment, which decreased the ratio of OPG/RANKL and the expression of osteoblastic factor RUNX2. Furthermore, Captopril treatment resulted in the increase of pAkt/Akt and pNF\u03baB expression in tibia. The present study revealed the impairing effects of Captopril on bone via interfering with the circulating sex hormone level and B2R pathway, which suggests that the bone metabolism of patients need to be carefully monitored when being prescribed for ACEIs.",

Since they were implemented in 2006, LCGPs are now available at 8 of the 10 largest pharmacy chains and include a wide variety of medication classes. LCGP medications are often purchased out of pocket; thus, a pharmacy claim may never be submitted and exposure may go unobserved in claims data.

The confluence of CV risk factors, in the context of cardio-metabolic perturbations that vary as renal function declines, complicates strategies for the care of patients with CKD. Understanding the existing evidence for effective CVD treatment strategies can help providers better care for these patients, navigate the complex treatment guidelines, which often differ across major organizations, and minimize the conflicting recommendations that new studies may pose. A pragmatic approach is to target a BP <140/90 mm Hg, which frequently requires more than two or three antihypertensive agents. Most guidelines recommend a combination of diuretic and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blockers, along with a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, beta blocker or other agent based on co-existing medical conditions. Consideration for a lower BP goal and/or other therapeutic interventions should be based on the etiology of CKD, stage of CKD, and/or presence of proteinuria. Finally, most patients with CKD, not on dialysis, would benefit from treatment with statins and non-pharmacologic lifestyle interventions should be promoted for all patients with CKD.", 
    "83": "Endothelial senescence, characterized by an irreversible cell cycle arrest, oxidative stress, and downregulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), has been shown to promote endothelial dysfunction leading to the development of age-related vascular disorders. This study has assessed the possibility that the local angiotensin system promotes endothelial senescence in coronary artery endothelial cells and also the protective effect of the Crataegus extract WS1442, a quantified hawthorn extract. Serial passaging from P1 to P4 (replicative senescence) and treatment of P1 endothelial cells with the eNOS inhibitor L-NAME (premature senescence) promoted acquisition of markers of senescence, enhanced ROS formation, decreased eNOS expression, and upregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and AT1 receptors. Increased SA-\u03b2-gal activity and the upregulation of ACE and AT1R in senescent cells were prevented by antioxidants, an ACE inhibitor, and by an AT1 receptor blocker. WS1442 prevented SA-\u03b2-gal activity, the downregulation of eNOS, and oxidative stress in P3 cells. These findings indicate that the impairment of eNOS-derived nitric oxide formation favors a pro-oxidant response triggering the local angiotensin system, which, in turn, promotes endothelial senescence. Such a sequence of events can be effectively inhibited by a standardized polyphenol-rich extract mainly by targeting the oxidative stress.",

They were divided into two groups randomly as follows: Group I (enalaprilalone, n = 36) and Group II (enalapril with cilnidipine, n = 35). In both the groups, baseline 24 h urinary albumin was estimated and was repeated every 3 months upto 1-year. After 1-year follow-up, reduction in microalbuminuria was found to be greater in Group II. In Group I microalbuminuria came down by 25.68 \u00b1 21.40 while in Group II it reduced by 54.88 \u00b1 13.84 (P < 0.001).

    "91": "Proline-rich oligopeptides (PROs) are a large family which comprises the bradykinin-potentiating peptides (BPPs). They inhibit the activity of the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) and have a typical pyroglutamyl (Pyr)/proline-rich structure at the N- and C-terminus, respectively. Furthermore, PROs decrease blood pressure in animals. In the present study, the isolation and biological characterization of a novel vasoactive BPP isolated from the skin secretion of the frog Brachycephalus ephippium is described. This new PRO, termed BPP-Brachy, has the primary structure WPPPKVSP and the amidated form termed BPP-BrachyNH2 inhibits efficiently ACE in rat serum. In silico molecular modeling and docking studies suggest that BPP-BrachyNH2 is capable of forming a hydrogen bond network as well as multiple van der Waals interactions with the rat ACE, which blocks the access of the substrate to the C-domain active site. Moreover, in rat thoracic aorta BPP-BrachyNH2 induces potent endothelium-dependent vasodilatation with similar magnitude as captopril. In DAF-FM DA-loaded aortic cross sections examined by confocal microscopy, BPP-BrachyNH2 was found to increase the release of nitric oxide (NO). Moreover, BPP-BrachyNH2 was devoid of toxicity in endothelial and smooth muscle cell cultures. In conclusion, the peptide BPP-BrachyNH2 has a novel sequence being the first BPP isolated from the skin secretion of the Brachycephalidae family.

    "97": "Correlation between blood pressure (BP) and target organ damage, vascular risk and long-term patient prognosis is greater for measurements derived from around-the-clock ambulatory BP monitoring than in-clinic daytime ones. Numerous studies consistently substantiate the asleep BP mean is both an independent and a much better predictor of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk than either the awake or 24\u2009h means. Sleep-time hypertension is much more prevalent than suspected, not only in patients with sleep disorders, but also among those who are elderly or have type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease or resistant hypertension. Hence, cost-effective adequate control of sleep-time BP is of marked clinical relevance. Ingestion time, according to circadian rhythms, of hypertension medications of six different classes and their combinations significantly affects BP control, particularly sleep-time BP, and adverse effects. For example, because the high-amplitude circadian rhythm of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activates during nighttime sleep, bedtime vs. morning ingestion of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers better reduces the asleep BP mean, with additional benefit, independent of medication terminal half-life, of converting the 24\u2009h BP profile into more normal dipper patterning. The MAPEC (Monitorizaci\u00f3n Ambulatoria para Predicci\u00f3n de Eventos Cardiovasculares) study, first prospective randomized treatment-time investigation designed to test the worthiness of bedtime chronotherapy with \u2a7e1 conventional hypertension medications so as to specifically target attenuation of asleep BP, demonstrated, relative to conventional morning therapy, 61% reduction of total CVD events and 67% decrease of major CVD events, that is, CVD death, myocardial infarction, and ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. The MAPEC study, along with other earlier conducted less refined trials, documents the asleep BP mean is the most significant prognostic marker of CVD morbidity and mortality; moreover, it substantiates attenuation of the asleep BP mean by a bedtime hypertension treatment strategy entailing the entire daily dose of \u2a7e1 hypertension medications significantly reduces CVD risk in both general and more vulnerable hypertensive patients, that is, those diagnosed with chronic kidney disease, diabetes and resistant hypertension.",

The Statement deals with target blood pressures, and the optimal agents for the treatment of hypertension in patients with stable angina, in acute coronary syndromes, and in patients with ischemic heart failure. In all cases, the recommended blood pressure target is <140/90 mm Hg, but <130/80 mm Hg may be appropriate, especially in those with a history of a previous myocardial infarction or stroke, or at high risk for developing either. These numbers may need to be revised after the publication of the SPRINT data. Appropriate management should include beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, and in the case of heart failure, aldosterone antagonists. Thiazide or thiazide-like (chlorthalidone) diuretics and calcium channel blockers can be used for the management of hypertension, but the evidence for improved outcomes compared with other agents in hypertension with coronary artery disease is meager.

We investigated whether an alteration in blood pressure (BP) induced by physical exercise and/or an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril) could affect locomotor activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats, with emphasis on the dopaminergic system. We used SHR and normotensive Wistar rats distributed into 4 groups for each strain: control, physical exercise, enalapril and physical exercise+enalapril. Physical exercise was performed on a treadmill, and enalapril was administered by gavage, both for 8weeks. During this period, locomotor activity was evaluated in an open field test, and BP was evaluated by tail plethysmography. Dopaminergic receptors, dopamine transporter and tyrosine hydroxylase levels at the striatum were evaluated by Western blotting. The control group of spontaneously hypertensive rats showed higher BP, increased activity in the open field test and lower levels of D2 receptors and tyrosine hydroxylase compared with all other groups throughout the experimental period. In general, physical exercise and enalapril attenuated these alterations. This study suggested the existence of comorbidity between hypertension and sleep-related movement disorders in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Physical exercise and enalapril conferred protection for both hypertension and the observed behavioral changes. In addition, these treatments led to changes in dopaminergic signaling in the striatal region (i.e., D2 receptor, TH and DAT).",

    "120": "Curcumin is known to improve cardiac function by balancing degradation and synthesis of collagens after myocardial infarction. This study tested the hypothesis that inhibition of myocardial fibrosis by curcumin is associated with modulating expression of angiotensin II (Ang II) receptors and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Male Sprague Dawley rats were subjected to Ang II infusion (500 ng/kg/min) using osmotic minipumps for 2 and 4 weeks, respectively, and curcumin (150 mg/kg/day) was fed by gastric gavage during Ang II infusion. Compared to the animals with Ang II infusion, curcumin significantly decreased the mean arterial blood pressure during the course of the observation. The protein level of the Ang II type 1 (AT1) receptor was reduced, and the Ang II type 2 (AT2) receptor was up-regulated, evidenced by an increased ratio of the AT2 receptor over the AT1 receptor in the curcumin group (1.2\u00b10.02%) vs in the Ang II group (0.7\u00b10.03%, P<0.05). These changes were coincident with less locally expressed AT1 receptor and enhanced AT2 receptor in the intracardiac vessels and intermyocardium. Along with these modulations, curcumin significantly decreased the populations of macrophages and alpha smooth muscle actin-expressing myofibroblasts, which were accompanied by reduced expression of transforming growth factor beta 1 and phosphorylated-Smad2/3. Collagen I synthesis was inhibited, and tissue fibrosis was attenuated, as demonstrated by less extensive collagen-rich fibrosis. Furthermore, curcumin increased protein level of ACE2 and enhanced its expression in the intermyocardium relative to the Ang II group. These results suggest that curcumin could be considered as an add-on therapeutic agent in the treatment of fibrosis-derived heart failure patient who is intolerant of ACE inhibitor therapy.",

Control group, hypertension group (HT) and TTS containing captopril hypertension group (HT-CAP) were assessed for the pharmacodynamic activity of the study. Pharmacodynamic activity of transdermal patches containing captopril was evaluated in rats by the measurement of systolic blood pressure for 24 h with the use of the tail cuff method.

Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatinine phosphokinase (CPK), glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), myeloperoxidase (MPO) and Na+, K(+)-ATPase were measured in the serum of rats. Histopathological evaluation of the heart tissue was conducted in order to determine any tissue damage. Blood pressure values of the TTS containing captopril hypertension group were decreased significantly and became almost similar with the blood pressure values of the control group. These results indicated that matrix type transdermal patches prepared with Eudragit RL 100 and RS 100 polymers containing captopril can be considered as transdermal therapeutic systems for chronical treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure.

Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies have shown that both obese and lean women with PCOS have some degree of insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is implicated in the ovulatory dysfunction of PCOS by disrupting the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis. Given the association with insulin resistance, all women with PCOS require evaluation for the risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its components, including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and the possible risk of clinical events, including acute myocardial infarction and stroke. Obese women with PCOS are at increased risk for MetS with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT; 31 to 35%) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM; 7.5 to 10%). Rates of progression from normal glucose tolerance to IGT, and in turn to T2DM, may be as high as 5 to 15% within 3 years. Data suggest the need for baseline oral glucose tolerance test every 1 to 2 years based on family history of T2DM as well as body mass index (BMI) and yearly in women with IGT. Compared with BMI- and age-matched controls, young, lean PCOS women have lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL) size, higher very-low-density lipoprotein particle number, higher low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particle number, and borderline lower LDL size. Statins have been shown to lower testosterone levels either alone or in combination with oral contraceptives (OCPs) but have not shown improvement in menses, spontaneous ovulation, hirsutism, or acne. Statins reduce total and LDL cholesterol but have no effect on HDL, C-reactive protein, fasting insulin, or homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance in PCOS women, in contrast to the general population. There have been no long-term studies of statins on clinical cardiac outcomes in women with PCOS. Coronary calcification is more prevalent and more severe in PCOS than in controls. In women under 60 years of age undergoing coronary angiography, the presence of polycystic ovaries on sonography has been associated with more arterial segments with >50% stenosis, but the relationship between PCOS and actual cardiovascular events remains unclear. Therapies for PCOS are varied in their effects and targets and include both nonpharmacologic as well as pharmacologic approaches. Weight loss is the primary therapy in PCOS--reduction in weight of as little as 5% can restore regular menses and improve response to ovulation- inducing and fertility medications. Metformin in premenopausal PCOS women has been associated with a reduction in features of MetS. Clamp studies using ethinyl estradiol/drosperinone combination failed to reveal evidence of an increase in either peripheral or hepatic insulin resistance. Subjects with PCOS have a 1.5-times higher baseline risk of venous thromboembolic disease and a 3.7-fold greater effect with OCP use compared with non-PCOS subjects. There is currently no genetic test to screen for or diagnose PCOS, and there is no test to assist in the choice of treatment strategies. Persistent bleeding should always be investigated for pregnancy and/or uterine pathology--including transvaginal ultrasound exam and endometrial biopsy--in women with PCOS. PCOS women can have difficulty conceiving. Those who become pregnant are at risk for gestational diabetes (which should be evaluated and managed appropriately) and the microvascular complications of diabetes. Assessment of a woman with PCOS for infertility involves evaluating for preconceptional issues that may affect response to therapy or lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes and evaluating the couple for other common infertility issues that may affect the choice of therapy, such as a semen analysis. Women with PCOS have multiple factors that may lead to an elevated risk of pregnancy, including a high prevalence of IGT--a clear risk factor for gestational diabetes--and MetS with hypertension, which increases the risk for pre-eclampsia and placental abruption. Women should be screened and treated for hypertension and diabetes prior to attempting conception. Women should be counseled about weight loss prior to attempting conception, although there are limited clinical trial data demonstrating a benefit to this recommendation. Treatment for women with PCOS and anovulatory infertility should begin with an oral agent such as clomiphene citrate or letrozole, an aromatase inhibitor.",

LCZ696 represents a first-in-class drug acting through inhibition of angiotensin receptor and neprilysin, thus modulating the renin angiotensin aldosterone system and vasoactive substances such as natriuretic peptides. Based on the PARADIGM-HF results, the FDA recently approved LCZ696 as an effective means to reduce the burden of HF with reduced ejection fraction. Furthermore, these data also provided rationale to test LCZ696 in an ongoing trial with HF and preserved ejection fraction. Despite the enthusiasm regarding this novel compound, real world data on its efficacy and safety are eagerly expected. This article summarizes all evidences regarding LCZ696 and how to implement this new drug in the current HF armamentarium.", 
    "141": "In the present study, we investigated the effect of methionine-enriched diet (MED) on blood pressure in rats and examined the protective effect of enalapril, a widely used angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) class antihypertensive drug. The results showed that MED induced significant increase of SBP and Ang II-induced contractile response in aortae of rats. MED significantly increased plasma levels of homocysteine (Hcy) and ACE. In addition, MED increased the phosphorylation of protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) and eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2\u03b1) and expression of activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) and ATF6 in aortae of rats, indicating the occurrence of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Moreover, MED resulted in oxidative stress as evidenced by significant increase of TBARS level and decrease of superoxide dismutase and catalase activities. Administration of enalapril could effectively inhibit these pathological changes induced by MED in rats. These results demonstrated that ACE-mediated ER stress and oxidative stress played an important role in high Hcy-induced hypertension and MED may exert a positive loop between the activation of ACE and accumulation of Hcy, aggravating the pathological condition of hypertension. The data provide novel insights into the mechanism of high Hcy-associated hypertension and the therapeutic efficiency of enalapril.", 
    "142": "The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) ramiprilat after intravenous (IV) and oral (PO) administration of ramipril have not been evaluated in horses. This study was designed to establish PK profiles for ramipril and ramiprilat as well as to determine the effects of ramiprilat on serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and to select the most appropriate ramipril dose that suppresses ACE activity. Six healthy horses in a cross-over design received IV ramipril 0.050\u2009mg/kg, PO at a dose of 0 (placebo), and 0.050, 0.10, 0.20, 0.40 and 0.80\u2009mg/kg ramipril. Blood pressures were measured and blood samples obtained at different times. Serum ramipril and ramiprilat concentrations and serum ACE activity were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and spectrophotometry, respectively. Systemic bioavailability of ramiprilat after PO ramipril was 6-9%. Percentages of maximum ACE inhibitions from baseline were 98.88 (IV ramipril), 5.31 (placebo) and 27.68, 39.27, 46.67, 76.13 and 84.27 (the five doses of PO ramipril). Blood pressure did not change during the experiments. Although oral availability of ramiprilat was low, ramipril has sufficient enteral absorption and bioconversion to ramiprilat to induce serum ACE inhibitions of almost 85% after a dose of 0.80\u2009mg/kg ramipril. Additional research on ramipril administration in equine patients is indicated.", 
    "143": "The purpose of this study was to introduce the technology for the development of rate-controlled oral drug delivery system to overcome various physiological problems. Several approaches are being used for the purpose of increasing the gastric retentive time, including floating drug delivery system. Gastric floating lisinopril maleate and metoprolol tartrate bilayer tablets were formulated by direct compression method using the sodium starch glycolate, crosscarmellose sodium for IR layer. Eudragit L100, pectin, acacia as sustained release polymers in different ratios for SR metoprolol tartrate layer and sodium bicarbonate, citric acid as gas generating agents for the floating extended release layer. The floating bilayer tablets of lisinopril maleate and metoprolol tartrate were designed to overcome the various problems associated with conventional oral dosage form. Floating tablets were evaluated for floating lag time, drug contents and in-vitro dissolution profile and different kinetic release models were applied. It was clear that the different ratios of polymers affected the drug release and floating time. L2 and M4 showed good drug release profile and floating behavior. The linear regression and model fitting showed that all formulation followed Higuchi model of drug release model except M4 that followed zero order kinetic. From the study it is evident that a promising controlled release by floating bilyer tablets of lisinopril maleate and metoprolol tartrate can be developed successfully.", 
    "144": "After its discovery in the early 1980s, the natriuretic peptide (NP) system has been extensively characterized and its potential influence in the development and progression of heart failure (HF) has been investigated. HF is a syndrome characterized by the activation of different neurohormonal systems, predominantly the renin-angiotensin (Ang)-aldosterone system (RAAS) and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), but also the NP system. Pharmacological interventions have been developed to counteract the neuroendocrine dysregulation, through the down modulation of RAAS with ACE (Ang-converting enzyme) inhibitors, ARBs (Ang receptor blockers) and mineralcorticoid antagonists and of SNS with \u03b2-blockers. In the last years, growing attention has been paid to the NP system. In the present review, we have summarized the current knowledge on the NP system, focusing on its role in HF and we provide an overview of the pharmacological attempts to modulate NP in HF: from the negative results of the study with neprilysin (NEP) inhibitors, alone or associated with an ACE inhibitor and vasopeptidase inhibitors, to the most recently and extremely encouraging results obtained with the new pharmacological class of Ang receptor and NEP inhibitor, currently defined ARNI (Ang receptor NEP inhibitor). Indeed, this new class of drugs to manage HF, supported by the recent results and a vast clinical development programme, may prompt a conceptual shift in the treatment of HF, moving from the inhibition of RAAS and SNS to a more integrated target to rebalance neurohormonal dysregulation in HF.", 
    "145": "In everyday practice, more commonly can we meet patients suffering from chronic kidney disease at different stages. Such patients are more susceptible to new risk factors, that can impair their health, along with the development of the disease. Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is the most common cause of death, that occurs in such group of patients. This article reviews the most important risk factors of SCD. They can be divided into two groups: heart dependent risk factors, such as: ischemic heart disease, cardiomyopathy, electrophysiology disturbances and dializo-therapy dependent risk factors, such as: type of dialysis, composition of dialysate, ions and hormonal disturbances. Also, prophylactic options, decreasing the risk of SCD, will be introduced, such as: pharmacotherapy, type of dializo-therapy and implantation of cardioverter-defibrillator.",

    "147": "Network meta-analysis was used to evaluate randomized controlled trials (RCT) which investigated antihypertensive treatments in ADPKD. PubMed, Embase, Ovid, and Cochrane Collaboration were searched. The primary outcome was estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Secondary outcomes were serum creatinine (Scr), urinary albumin excretion (UAE), systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), mean artery pressure (MAP) and left ventricular mass index (LVMI).", 
    "148": "We included 10 RCTs with 1386 patients and six interventions: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), Angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), combination of ACEI and ARB, calcium channel blockers (CCB), \u03b2-blockers and dilazep. There was no difference of eGFR in all the treatments in both network and direct comparisons. No significant differences of Scr, SBP, DBP, MAP, and LVMI were found in network comparisons. However, ACEI signi\ufb01cantly reduced SBP, DBP, MAP and LVMI when compared to CCB. Significantly increased UAE was observed in CCB compared with ACEI or ARB. Bayesian probability analysis found ARB ranked first in the surrogate measures of eGFR, UAE and SBP.",

    "150": "Ramipril has recently been shown to have anti-atherogenic properties. However, the specific mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of ramipril on induction of adhesion molecules in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) using high-glucose (HG) conditions and to investigate possible underlying molecular mechanisms. The effects of ramipril on expression of intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1 production, and ERK phosphorylation were examined in HG-induced HUVECs with inhibitors targeting the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. HG induced the expression of the adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and VCAM-1. Pretreatment with ramipril drastically inhibited ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 production in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Moreover, upon investigating the effects of ramipril on the MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway, we found that ramipril completely inhibited HG-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2. ERK inhibitors completely prevented the inhibitory effect of HG. This study demonstrated that ramipril reduces HG-stimulated induction of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression via MAPK signaling, which may be useful for inhibition of atherosclerosis.", 
    "151": "The endothelium exerts multiple actions involving regulation of vascular permeability and tone, coagulation and fibrinolysis, inflammatory and immunological reactions and cell growth. Alterations of one or more such actions may cause vascular endothelial dysfunction. Different risk factors such as hypercholesterolemia, homocystinemia, hyperglycemia, hypertension, smoking, inflammation, and aging contribute to the development of endothelial dysfunction. Mechanisms underlying endothelial dysfunction are multiple, including impaired endothelium-derived vasodilators, enhanced endothelium-derived vasoconstrictors, over production of reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species, activation of inflammatory and immune reactions, and imbalance of coagulation and fibrinolysis. Endothelial dysfunction occurs in many cardiovascular diseases, which involves different mechanisms, depending on specific risk factors affecting the disease. Among these mechanisms, a reduction in nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability plays a central role in the development of endothelial dysfunction because NO exerts diverse physiological actions, including vasodilation, anti-inflammation, antiplatelet, antiproliferation and antimigration. Experimental and clinical studies have demonstrated that a variety of currently used or investigational drugs, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin AT1 receptors blockers, angiotensin-(1-7), antioxidants, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, endothelial NO synthase enhancers, phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors, sphingosine-1-phosphate and statins, exert endothelial protective effects. Due to the difference in mechanisms of action, these drugs need to be used according to specific mechanisms underlying endothelial dysfunction of the disease.", 
    "152": "Evidence for pharmacogenetic risk stratification of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) treatment is limited. Therefore, in a cohort of ACEI-treated patients with congestive heart failure (CHF), we investigated the predictive value of two pharmacogenetic scores that previously were found to predict ACEI efficacy in patients with ischemic heart disease and hypertension, respectively. Score A combined single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the angiotensin II receptor type 1 gene (rs275651 and rs5182) and the bradykinin receptor B1 gene (rs12050217). Score B combined SNPs of the angiotensin-converting enzyme gene (rs4343) and ABO blood group genes (rs495828 and rs8176746).",

We used Cox's proportional hazard regression model to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for the risk of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and first hospitalization for cardiovascular disease (CVD) for losartan and ramipril versus conventional antihypertensive agents. In total, 136,266 hypertensive patients with CKD in Taiwan were followed up from 2001 to 2008. In an average follow-up of 5.9 years, 7364 (5.40%) patients reached ESRD, 4165 (3.06%) patients died, and 6163 (4.52%) patients had their first hospitalization for CVD. Use of losartan or ramipril was associated with a lower risk of the endpoints compared with the conventional group. In the losartan group, the risks of ESRD, all- and cardiovascular-cause mortality, and first hospitalization for CVD were decreased by 9.2% (P = 0.01), 24.6% (P < 0.001), 12.4% (P = 0.03), and 36.0% (P = 0.01), respectively. In the ramipril group, these risks decreased by 7.6% (P = 0.02) for ESRD, 56.9% (P < 0.001) for all-cause mortality, 7.5% (P = 0.04) for cardiovascular mortality, and 24.7% (P < 0.001) for first hospitalization. This study indicated that losartan and ramipril had distinct association on the prognosis of hypertensive patients with CKD, and was first to disclose that the mean time to reach each endpoint for patients in the losartan, ramipril, and conventional group was not significantly different.

    "165": "Fibrotic cardiac remodeling ultimately leads to heart failure - a debilitating and costly condition. Select antihypertensive agents have been effective in reducing or slowing the development of cardiac fibrosis. Moreover, some experimental studies have shown that the reduction in fibrosis induced by these agents persists long after stopping treatment. What has not been as well investigated is whether this transient treatment results in a protection against future fibrotic cardiac remodeling. In the present review, previously published studies are re-examined to assess whether the relative percent increase in collagen deposition over an off-treatment period is attenuated, relative to control, following transient antihypertensive treatment in young or adult rats. Present findings suggest that transient inhibition of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) not only produces a sustained reduction in cardiac fibrosis, but also results in a degree of protection against future collagen deposition. In addition, prior transient RAS inhibition appears to alter the cardiac fibroblast phenotype such that these cells show a muted response to myocardial injury - namely reduced proliferation, chemokine release, and collagen deposition. This review puts forth several potential mechanisms underlying this long-term cardiac protection that is afforded by transient RAS inhibition. Specifically, fibroblast phenotypic change, cardiac fibroblast apoptosis, sustained suppression of the RAS, persistent reduction in left ventricular hypertrophy, and persistent reduction in arterial pressure are each discussed. Identifying the mechanisms ultimately responsible for this change in cardiac fibroblast response to injury, hypertension, and aging may reveal novel targets for therapy.",

Conversely, drugs that alter renal function can modify its serum levels and lead to the potentially fatal lithium intoxication. A search in the main library databases from 1975 to 2015 to identify interactions between antihypertensive drugs and lithium using the Population Intervention Comparison Outcome strategy provided only 30 reports of lithium intoxication. A regression analysis showed that the severity of lithium intoxication was significantly predicted by female, age, and use of certain classes of antihypertensive agents. A model including certain albeit not all diuretics and/or inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system, but not age, serum lithium or creatinine levels at baseline and/or on admission to the hospital, predicted lithium toxicity. The true incidence of lithium intoxication is unknown but probably low, albeit underestimated.

Serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity was measured and systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressures were recorded at rest (R), 2\u2009h after placebo or ACEI administration (pre-E) and within the first 20\u2009s after exercise (post-E). Mean maximum serum ACE inhibition 2\u2009h after PO administration was 4.8% (placebo), 39.4% (enalapril), 46.4% (quinapril), 55.0% (ramipril) and 71.68% (benazepril). There were no significant differences in serum ACE inhibition between enalapril and quinapril. SBP and DBP at times R and pre-E were not different in any of the five trials. In response to exercise, SBP increased by 67.6% (placebo), 52.7% (enalapril), 43.1% (quinapril), 26.6% (ramipril) and 4.2% (benazepril).

We report a case of idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) initially presented with biventricular failure, which was misdiagnosed as PH-LHD. A 31-year-old man who had a history of recurrent hemoptysis was referred to our center with biventricular failure. Right heart catheterization (RHC) showed elevated mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP).

We treated him for 2 years with diuretics, a beta blocker, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, and sildenafil, which was added to treat CpcPH. A follow-up echocardiography showed that biventricular function had improved, but not PH. A second RHC revealed elevated mPAP and normal PCWP, which made us change the diagnosis to IPAH. In conclusion, it is important to perform repeated RHC in CpcPH patients after the improvement of left heart dysfunction to distinguish CpcPH from IPAH.",

This study aimed to compare serial serum levels of the components of the RAS in patients before and after surgical excision, propranolol or captopril treatment for problematic proliferating IH. Patients with problematic proliferating IH underwent measurements of serum levels of plasma renin activity (PRA), ACE and angiotensin II (ATII) before, and 1-2 and 6 months following surgical excision, propranolol or captopril treatment. This study included 27 patients undergoing surgical excision (n\u00a0=\u00a08), propranolol (n\u00a0=\u00a011) and captopril (n\u00a0=\u00a08) treatment. Treatment with either surgical excision or propranolol resulted in significant decrease in the mean levels of PRA. Surgical excision or captopril treatment led to significant decline in the mean levels of ATII. All three treatment modalities had no significant effect on the mean levels of ACE. This study demonstrates the effect of surgical excision, propranolol and captopril treatment in lowering the levels of PRA and ATII, but not ACE, supporting a mechanistic role for the RAS in the biology of IH.",

This review will discuss the involvement of ROS in atherosclerosis, specifically their effect on inflammation, disturbed blood flow and arterial wall remodeling. Pharmacological interventions target ROS in order to alleviate oxidative stress and CVD symptoms, yet results are varied due to the paradoxical role of ROS in CVD. Lack of effectiveness in clinical trials suggests that understanding the exact role of ROS in the pathophysiology of CVD and developing novel treatments, such as antioxidant gene therapy and nanotechnology-related antioxidant delivery, could provide a therapeutic advance in treating CVDs. While genetic therapies focusing on specific antioxidant expression seem promising in CVD treatments, multiple technological challenges exist precluding its immediate clinical applications.",

    "230": "Renin is synthesized in the principal cells of the collecting duct (CD), and its production is increased via cAMP in angiotensin (ANG) II-dependent hypertension, despite suppression of juxtaglomerular (JG) renin. Vasopressin, one of the effector hormones of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) via the type 2-receptor (V2R), activates the cAMP/PKA/cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) pathway and aquaporin-2 expression in principal cells of the CD. Accordingly, we hypothesized that activation of V2R increases renin synthesis via PKA/CREB, independently of ANG II type 1 (AT1) receptor activation in CD cells. Desmopressin (DDAVP; 10(-6) M), a selective V2R agonist, increased renin mRNA (\u223c3-fold), prorenin (\u223c1.5-fold), and renin (\u223c2-fold) in cell lysates and cell culture media in the M-1 CD cell line. Cotreatment with DDAVP+H89 (PKA inhibitor) or CREB short hairpin (sh) RNA prevented this response. H89 also blunted DDAVP-induced CREB phosphorylation and nuclear localization. In 48-h water-deprived (WD) mice, prorenin-renin protein levels were increased in the renal inner medulla (\u223c1.4- and 1.8-fold). In WD mice treated with an ACE inhibitor plus AT1 receptor blockade, renin mRNA and prorenin protein levels were still higher than controls, while renin protein content was not changed. In M-1 cells, ANG II or DDAVP increased prorenin-renin protein levels; however, there were no further increases by combined treatment. These results indicate that in the CD the activation of the V2R stimulates renin synthesis via the PKA/CREB pathway independently of RAS, suggesting a critical role for vasopressin in the regulation of renin in the CD.",

In the absence of hypertensive target organ damage (TOD), stage I hypertension is managed first by diet and exercise, with the addition of drug therapy if this fails. First-line treatment of stage I hypertension with TOD and stage II hypertension includes both lifestyle changes and medications. First-line agents include angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, and calcium-channel blockers. Hypertensive emergency with end-organ effects requires immediate modest blood pressure reduction to alleviate symptoms. This is usually accomplished with IV medications. Long-term reduction in blood pressure to normal levels is accomplished gradually. Specific medication choice for outpatient hypertension management is determined by the underlying cause of hypertension and the comparative adverse effect profiles, along with practical considerations such as cost and frequency of administration. Antihypertensive medication is initiated at a starting dose and can be gradually increased to effect. If ineffective at the recommended maximum dose, an additional medication with a complementary mechanism of action can be added.",

    "303": "The Korean Society of Hypertension published new guidelines for the management of hypertension in 2013 which fully revised the first Korean hypertension treatment guideline published in 2004. Due to shortage of Korean data, the Committee decided to establish the guideline in the form of an 'adaptation' of the recently released guidelines. The prevalence of hypertension was 28.5% in the recent Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in 2011, and the awareness, treatment, and control rates are generally improving. However, the risks for cerebrovascular disease and coronary artery disease which are attributable to hypertension were the highest in Korea. The classification of hypertension is the same as in other guidelines. The remarkable difference is that prehypertension is further classified as stage 1 and 2 prehypertension because the cardiovascular risk is significantly different within the prehypertensive range. Although the decision-making was based on office blood pressure (BP) measured by the auscultation method using a stethoscope, the importance of home BP measurement and ambulatory BP monitoring is also stressed. The Korean guideline does not recommend a drug therapy in patients within the prehypertensive range, even in patients with prediabetes, diabetes mellitus, stroke, or coronary artery disease. In an elderly population over 65 years old, drug therapy can be initiated when the systolic BP (SBP) is \u2265160 mm Hg. The target BP is generally an SBP of <140 mm Hg and a diastolic BP (DBP) of <90 mm Hg regardless of previous cardiovascular events. However, in patients with hypertension and diabetes, the lower DBP control <85 mm Hg is recommended. Also, in patients with hypertension with prominent albuminuria, a more strict SBP control <130 mm Hg can be recommended. In lifestyle modification, sodium reduction is the most important factor in Korea. Five classes of antihypertensive drugs, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, \u03b2-blockers, calcium antagonists, and diuretics, are equally recommended as a first-line treatment, whereas a combination therapy chosen from renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, calcium antagonists, and diuretics is preferentially recommended.", 
    "304": "The renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) plays a central role in the pathophysiology of hypertension and vascular disease. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis) suppress angiotensin II (ANG II) concentrations, whereas angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) block the binding of ANG II to AT1 receptors. ACEis and ARBs are both effective anti-hypertensive agents and have similar risk reductions in stroke - a blood pressure dependent phenomenon. ACEis also reduce the risk of myocardial infarction (MI) and mortality in high risk hypertensive patients, as well as in diabetics, the elderly, those with vascular disease, and in congestive heart failure. ARBs, in contrast, do not reduce the risk of MI or death in clinical trials where the comparator has been another active therapy or even a placebo. Systematic reviews of ARBs that include meta-analyses or meta-regression analyses confirm that ARBs lack the cardiovascular protective effects of ACEis, which in part are \"independent\" of blood pressure lowering. Practice guidelines, especially those in high risk hypertensive patients, should reflect the evidence that ACEis and ARBs have divergent cardiovascular effects - ACEis reduce mortality, whereas ARBs do not. ACEis should be the preferred RAAS inhibitor in high risk patients.", 
    "305": "One-third of women with heart disease use medication for the treatment of cardiovascular disease (CVD) during pregnancy.

Fortunately, many drugs used to treat CVD can be used safely during pregnancy, with the exception of high-dose warfarin in the first trimester, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, amiodarone, and spironolactone. A timely and thorough discussion between the cardiologist and the pregnant patient about the potential benefits and adverse effects of medication for CVD is important.

    "306": "Fibrotic lung diseases carry a significant mortality burden worldwide. A large proportion of these deaths are due to right heart failure and pulmonary hypertension. Underlying contributory factors which appear to play a role in the mechanism of progression of right heart dysfunction include chronic hypoxia, defective calcium handling, hyperaldosteronism, pulmonary vascular alterations, cyclic strain of pressure and volume changes, elevation of circulating TGF-\u03b2, and elevated systemic NO levels. Specific therapies targeting pulmonary hypertension include calcium channel blockers, endothelin (ET-1) receptor antagonists, prostacyclin analogs, phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, and rho-kinase (ROCK) inhibitors. Newer antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory agents may exert beneficial effects on heart failure in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Furthermore, right ventricle-targeted therapies, aimed at mitigating the effects of functional right ventricular failure, include \u03b2-adrenoceptor (\u03b2-AR) blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, antioxidants, modulators of metabolism, and 5-hydroxytryptamine-2B (5-HT2B) receptor antagonists. Newer nonpharmacologic modalities for right ventricular support are increasingly being implemented.

Patients were randomly assigned to consume 120\u200ag/day of 1 of the 3 types of bread for each nutritional intervention: conventional wheat bread (CB), low-sodium wheat bread enriched in potassium (LSB), and low-sodium wheat bread rich in potassium, GABA, and ACEI peptides (LSB\u200a+\u200aG). For each period, 24-hour BP measurements, in vivo endothelial function, and biochemical samples were obtained.After LSB\u200a+\u200aG consumption, 24-hour ambulatory BP underwent a nonsignificant greater reduction than after the consumption of CB and LSB (0.26\u200amm Hg in systolic BP and -0.63\u200amm Hg in diastolic BP for CB; -0.71\u200amm Hg in systolic BP and -1.08\u200amm Hg in diastolic BP for LSB; and -0.75\u200amm Hg in systolic BP and -2.12\u200amm Hg in diastolic BP for LSB\u200a+\u200aG, respectively). Diastolic BP at rest decreased significantly during the LSB\u200a+\u200aG intervention, although there were no significant differences in changes between interventions. There were no significant differences between interventions in terms of changes in in vivo endothelial function, glucose metabolism, and peripheral inflammatory parameters.Compared with the consumption of CB or LSB, no greater beneficial effects on 24-hour BP, endothelial function, or glucose metabolism were demonstrated after the consumption of LSB\u200a+\u200aG in a population with pre or mild-to-moderate hypertension.

For patients with GFR >50\u00a0ml/min and proteinuria persistently higher than 1\u00a0g/day, they suggest a 6-month course of corticosteroid therapy. Based on our experience and the results of the literature, we propose a progressive treatment, which takes into account the time the IgAN is recognized and the clinical conditions present at that time. The treatment can be summarize as follows: (1) in patients with macro-microscopic haematuria, in case with proteinuria less than 0.3\u00a0g/day, only annual controls; (2) in patients with proteinuria between 0.3 and 0.9\u00a0g/day, ACE-I and/or ARB, with titration of the drugs; (3) in patients with proteinuria higher than 1\u00a0g/day, in case with the presence of arterial hypertension and GFR up to 30\u00a0ml/min, 6\u00a0months course of corticosteroids, in addition to ACE-I and/or ARB; (4) in patients with GFR less than 30\u00a0ml/min, ACE-I/ARB, dialysis and kidney transplantation; corticosteroids should be in case considered for patients with persistently high or increasing proteinuria; (5) the immunosuppressants (cyclophosphamide and azathioprine) should be reserved for patients with progressive renal insufficiency or with vasculitic lesions on renal biopsy.",

The present case report, the appraisal of the current knowledge on the onset of AKI and the analysis of available pharmacovigilance databases indicate that particular caution should be exercised when infants affected by heart failure are treated with the enalapril and furosemide combination therapy. Moreover, we strongly suggest an up-to-date revision of the ACE-inhibitor dosing guidelines in pediatric patients to define unambiguously the safe upper limits of this class of drugs.",

    "311": "Angioedema refers to a localized oedematous swelling of subcutaneous or submucosal tissues, caused by dilatation and increased permeability of blood vessels, usually mediated either by histamine or by bradykinin. Deficiency or loss of functional activity of the complement component C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH) affects multiple systems, including the kallikrein-kinin, complement, coagulation and fibrinolytic pathways, and in the context of angioedema, the result is increased production and release of bradykinin and other vasoactive substances such as C3a. Owing to impairment of C1-INH, factors Xlla and kallikrein, by a positive feedback mechanism, bring about persistent activation of the kallikrein-kinin pathway with amplification of production of bradykinin, resulting in angioedema. Histamine can cause histaminergic angioedema. As the name implies, this oedema is caused by degranulation of mast cells/basophils as a result of an IgE-dependant allergic reaction to extracts of food, drugs, infectious agents, or to physical stimulation; or as the result of direct degranulation of mast cells/basophils independently of IgE, caused by releasing agents such as opiates, antibiotics or radiocontrast media.

Our study explored whether sildenafil protects against I/R-induced damage in a porcine cardiac arrest and resuscitation (CAR) model via modulating the renin-angiotensin system. Male pigs were randomly divided to three groups: Sham group, Saline group, and sildenafil (0.5 mg/kg) group. Thirty min after drug infusion, ventricular fibrillation (8 min) and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (up to 30 min) was conducted in these animals. We found that sildenafil ameliorated the reduced cardiac function and improved the 24-h survival rate in this model. Sildenafil partly attenuated the increases of plasma angiotensin II (Ang II) and Ang (1-7) levels after CAR. Sildenafil also decreased apoptosis and Ang II expression in myocardium. The increases of expression of angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE), ACE2, Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1R), and the Ang (1-7) receptor Mas in myocardial tissue were enhanced after CAR. Sildenafil suppressed AT1R up-regulation, but had no effect on ACE, ACE2, and Mas expression. Sildenafil further boosted the upregulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and inducible nitric oxide synthase(iNOS). Collectively, our results suggest that cardioprotection of sildenafil in CAR model is accompanied by an inhibition of Ang II-AT1R axis activation.",

The model was developed in 6220 patients (two hospitals) and externally validated in 4395 patients from a third hospital. Several preoperative variables were selected for candidate predictors, based on literature, clinical expertise, and availability in the orthopaedic surgery setting. The main outcomes were the development of any severity of acute kidney injury (stages 1-3) within the first postoperative week, and 90 day, one year, and longer term survival.",

The model's predictive performance for discrimination was good (C statistic 0.74 in development cohort, 0.70 in validation cohort). Calibration was good in the development cohort and after recalibration in the validation cohort. Only the highest risks were over-predicted. Survival was worse in patients with acute kidney injury compared with those without (adjusted hazard ratio 1.53, 95% confidence interval 1.38 to 1.70). This was most noticeable in the short term (adjusted hazard ratio: 90 day 2.36, 1.94 to 2.87) and diminished over time (90 day-one year 1.40, 1.10 to 1.79; >1 year 1.28, 1.10 to 1.48).

Our objective was to determine the main characteristics of ACEI-AAE attacks and, in doing so, the factors associated with likelihood of hospital admission from the emergency department (ED) after a visit for an attack.A prospective, multicenter, observational study (April 2012-December 2014) was conducted in EDs of 4 French hospitals in collaboration with emergency services (SAMU 93) and a reference center for bradykinin-mediated angioedema. For each patient presenting with an attack, emergency physicians collected demographic and clinical presentation data, treatments, and clinical course. They recorded time intervals from symptom onset to ED arrival and to treatment decision, from ED arrival to specific treatment with plasma-derived C1-inhibitor (C1-INH) or icatibant, and from specific treatment to onset of symptom relief. Attacks requiring hospital admission were compared with those not requiring admission.Sixty-two eligible patients with ACEI-AAE (56% men, median age 63 years) were included. Symptom relief occurred significantly earlier in patients receiving specific treatment than in untreated patients (0.5 [0.5-1.0] versus 3.9 [2.5-7.0] hours; P\u200a<\u200a0.0001). Even though icatibant was injected more promptly than plasma-derived C1-INH, there, however, was no significant difference in median time to onset of symptom relief between the 2 drugs (0.5 [0.5-1.3] versus 0.5 [0.4-1.0] hours for C1-INH and icatibant, respectively, P\u200a=\u200a0.49). Of the 62 patients, 27 (44%) were admitted to hospital from the ED. In multivariate analysis, laryngeal involvement and progressive swelling at ED arrival were independently associated with admission (Odds ratio [95% confidence interval]\u200a=\u200a6.2 [1.3-28.2] and 5.9 [1.3-26.5], respectively). A favorable course was observed in all patients. Three patients (5%) experienced a recurrence after angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor discontinuation after a median follow-up of 18 (11-30) months.Two severity criteria-laryngeal edema and the progression of the edema-were independent factors associated with likelihood of hospital admission. Appropriate specific treatments (plasma-derived C1-INH or icatibant) should be available in EDs to prevent possibly life-threatening complications.",

In Stage I, 206 patient records from 15 randomly chosen GP practices were analysed; 76\u00a0% of patients were prescribed ACE-inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ACEIs/ARBs), 73\u00a0% beta blocker (BBs), but only 18\u00a0% mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs). ACEI doses were at 62\u00a0% of the guideline recommended target doses, BBs at 46\u00a0%, while MRAs were sufficiently highly dosed. The guideline adherence indicator (GAI-3) was only 22\u00a0%. In Stage II, GPs in all 15 practices were interviewed, and health record documentation deficits and patients' contraindications were taken into account. This increased the percentage of patients correctly prescribed ACEIs/ARBs to 87\u00a0%, BBs to 84\u00a0% and GAI-3 to 56\u00a0%. MRAs exhibited the most frequent contraindications, but remained underprescribed. Many GPs seemed not to be aware of the therapeutic value of MRAs or the need to reach target doses of the indicated drug classes. Patients-interviewed in Stage III-reported good tolerability of HF-drugs and generally good compliance, although 11\u00a0% discontinued HF-medication on their own.",

Of these, 21,357 unigenes had homologues in public databases, but the remaining unigenes had no significant matches due to the limited sequence information available and species-specific novel sequences. Functional annotation of the unigenes also revealed general gene expression profile characteristics in the tentacle of C. capillata. A primary goal of this study was to identify putative toxin transcripts. As expected, we screened many transcripts encoding proteins similar to several well-known toxin families including phospholipases, metalloproteases, serine proteases and serine protease inhibitors. In addition, some transcripts also resembled molecules with potential toxic activities, including cnidarian CfTX-like toxins with hemolytic activity, plancitoxin-1, venom toxin-like peptide-6, histamine-releasing factor, neprilysin, dipeptidyl peptidase 4, vascular endothelial growth factor A, angiotensin-converting enzyme-like and endothelin-converting enzyme 1-like proteins. Most of these molecules have not been previously reported in jellyfish.

All groups except the sham operation group were given 30 min ischemia in left anterior descending (LAD) coronary arteries. All groups were then given 120 min reperfusion to the LAD. Before reperfusion, the R-post, R-post +Ace, R-post +AC, R-post +AV groups were given 10 min remifentanil post-conditioning. Hemodynamic data were measured every 30 min after initiation of ischemia. The rats' hearts were exercised for detecting infarct size and water content in the left ventricle, and AQP1 expression were also detected.", 
    "351": "The R-post group showed a significant reduction of the infarct size compared to the I/R group. The effect of R-post for reducing infarct size was slightly enhanced by adding acetazolamide to R-post, so significant differences could still be found when compared R-post+Ace group to the I/R group. The effect of infarct size reduction brought by R-post was blocked by the opioid-receptor antagonist compounds. This effect was also blocked by the AQP1 enhancer.

However, captopril-treated could reverse chondrocytes abnormality in OA rats. Furthermore, the mRNA and protein expression of RAS components, renin, ACE, Ang II AT1R were upregulated in the proximal tibia of OA rats, however, the AT2R expression was suppressed.

Chronic inflammation is closely linked to diseases associated with endothelial dysfunction, and age-related macular degeneration is accompanied by a general inflammatory response. According to current concept, age-related macular degeneration is a local manifestation of systemic vascular disease. This recognition could have therapeutic implications because restoration of endothelial dysfunction can restabilize the condition of chronic vascular disease including age-related macular degeneration as well. Restoration of endothelial dysfunction by pharmaacological or non pharmacological interventions may prevent the development or improve endothelial dysfunction, which result in prevention or improvement of age related macular degeneration as well. Medicines including inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers and renin inhibitors), statins, acetylsalicylic acid, trimetazidin, third generation beta-blockers, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonists, folate, vitamin D, melatonin, advanced glycation end-product crosslink breaker alagebrium, endothelin-receptor antagonist bosentan, coenzyme Q10; \"causal\" antioxidant vitamins, N-acetyl-cysteine, resveratrol, L-arginine, serotonin receptor agonists, tumor necrosis factor-alpha blockers, specific inhibitor of the complement alternative pathway, curcumin and doxycyclin all have beneficial effects on endothelial dysfunction. Restoration of endothelial dysfunction can restabilize chronic vascular disease including age-related macular degeneration as well. Considering that the human vascular system is consubstantial, medicines listed above should be given to patients (1) who have no macular degeneration but have risk factors for the disease and are older than 50 years; (2) who have been diagnosed with unilateral age-related macular degeneration in order to prevent damage of the contralateral eye; (3) who have bilateral age-related macular degeneration in order to avert deterioration and in the hope of a potential improvement.

One of the precipitating factors for pseudolymphoma is drugs like anticonvulsants, antidepressants and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. According to existing literature phenytoin-induced cutaneous pseudolymphomas are usually T-cell predominant. Most often withdrawal of the drug with or without short-course systemic steroids can attain a cure. Rarely malignant transformation has been reported years later despite withdrawal of the offending drug, which necessitates a long-term follow up of the affected. We report an 80-year-old male patient who was receiving phenytoin sodium and who presented with diffuse erythema and infiltrated skin lesions which histologically resembled cutaneous B-cell lymphoma. Substituting phenytoin with levetiracetam achieved resolution of symptoms. Further evaluation was suggestive of a reactive process. A detailed drug history is of paramount importance in differentiating drug-induced pseudolymphoma from lymphoma. Searching literature we could not find any previous reports of phenytoin-induced cutaneous B-cell pseudolymphoma.",

The prevalence of different types of potentially hazardous prescribing ranged from almost zero to 10.2%, and for inadequate monitoring ranged from 10.4% to 41.9%. Older patients and those prescribed multiple repeat medications had significantly higher risks of triggering a prescribing indicator whereas younger patients with fewer repeat prescriptions had significantly higher risk of triggering a monitoring indicator. There was high variation between practices for some indicators. Though prescribing safety indicators describe prescribing patterns that can increase the risk of harm to the patient and should generally be avoided, there will always be exceptions where the indicator is clinically justified. Furthermore there is the possibility that some information is not captured by CPRD for some practices-for example, INR results in patients receiving warfarin.",

A significant heterogeneity between series was evident, which could be explained by a significant influence of the baseline blood pressure status of the subjects, the effect of IPP/VPP on SBP being stronger in hypertensive subjects (-8.35 mm Hg, P<0.0001) than in non-hypertensive subjects (-3.42mm Hg, P<0.0001). Furthermore, the effect of IPP/VPP on SBP remained significant when limiting the analysis to series that tested the usual doses of IPP/VPP consumed daily (below 5 mg/d), with estimated effects of -6.01 mm Hg in the overall population and -3.32 mm Hg in non-hypertensive subjects.",

To study its in vivo action, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) were orally administration with high- or low-dose of HBMP for 28 days. Major components of the renin-angiotensin (RAS) system in serum of SHRs from different groups were analyzed, and gene expression profiling were performed in the kidney of SHRs, using the Whole Rat Genome Oligonucleotide Microarray. Results indicated although genes involved in RAS system were not significantly altered, those related to blood coagulation system, cytokine and growth factor, and fatty acids metabolism were remarkablely changed. Several genes which were seldom reported to be implicated in pathogenesis of hypertension also showed significant expression alterations after oral administration of HBMP. These data provided valuable information for our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie the potential antihypertensive activities of HBMP, and will contribute towards increased value-added utilization of blue mussel protein.",

However, the actin polymerization and protein tyrosine phosphorylation are the two necessary steps for capacitation. In this study, we have demonstrated the actin polymerization and established the correlation between protein tyrosine phosphorylation and actin reorganization during in vitro capacitation in buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) spermatozoa. Indirect immunofluorescence and Western blot techniques were used to detect actin polymerization and tyrosine phosphorylation. The time-dependent fluorimetric studies revealed that the actin polymerization starts from the tail region and progressed towards the head region of spermatozoa during capacitation. The lysophosphatidyl choline (LPC)-induced acrosome reaction (AR) stimulated quick actin depolymerization. The inhibitor cytochalasin D (CD) blocked the in vitro capacitation by inhibiting the actin polymerization. In addition, we also performed different inhibitor (Genistein, H-89, PD9809 and GF-109) and enhancer (dbcAMP, H(2)O(2) and vanadate) studies on actin tyrosine phosphorylation and actin polymerization. The inhibitors of tyrosine phosphorylation inhibit actin tyrosine phosphorylation and polymerization, whereas enhancers of tyrosine phosphorylation stimulate F-actin formation and tyrosine phosphorylation. These observations suggest that the tyrosine phosphorylation regulates the actin polymerization, and both are coupled processes during capacitation of buffalo spermatozoa.",

    "425": "Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is an endogenously synthesised and diet-supplied lipid-soluble cofactor that functions in the mitochondrial inner membrane to transfer electrons from complexes I and II to complex III. In addition, its redox activity enables CoQ10 to act as a membrane antioxidant. In patients with congestive heart failure, myocardial CoQ10 content tends to decline as the degree of heart failure worsens. A number of controlled pilot trials with supplemental CoQ10 in heart failure found improvements in functional parameters such as ejection fraction, stroke volume and cardiac output, without side effects. Subsequent meta-analyses have confirmed these findings, although the magnitude of benefit tends to be less notable in patients with severe heart failure, or within the context of ACE inhibitor therapy. The multicentre randomised placebo-controlled Q-SYMBIO trial has assessed the impact of supplemental CoQ10 on hard endpoints in heart failure. A total of 420 patients received either CoQ10 (100\u2005mg three times daily) or placebo and were followed for 2\u2005years. Although short-term functional endpoints were not statistically different in the two groups, CoQ10 significantly reduced the primary long-term endpoint-a major adverse cardiovascular event-which was observed in 15% of the treated participants compared to 26% of those receiving placebo (HR=0.50, CI 0.32 to 0.80, p=0.003). Particularly in light of the excellent tolerance and affordability of this natural physiological compound, supplemental CoQ10 has emerged as an attractive option in the management of heart failure, and merits evaluation in additional large studies.",

Changes in albuminuria in the first 6 months were linearly associated with renal and cardiovascular endpoints: a >30% reduction in albuminuria in the first 6 months was associated with a 62% reduction in renal risk and a 25% reduction in cardiovascular risk compared with an increase in albuminuria. The association between changes at 6 months in albuminuria and renal or cardiovascular endpoints was similar in the two treatment groups (p for interaction >0.1 for both endpoints).", 
    "429": "The addition of aliskiren to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker therapy resulted in albuminuria changes that were associated with renal and cardiovascular risk changes.

ATMOSPHERE patients were generally similar to those in PARADIGM-HF although fewer had diabetes, renal dysfunction, and were treated with a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. In ATMOSPHERE, patients with diabetes differed in numerous ways from those without. Patients with diabetes were older and had worse heart failure status but a similar left ventricular ejection fraction (mean 28%); they had a higher body mass index and more co-morbidity, especially hypertension and coronary heart disease. Mean estimated glomerular filtration rate was slightly lower in those with diabetes compared with those without.",

Seven days after UUO, there were significant reductions in the expression of both collagen 1 and collagen 3 in kidneys treated with Ac-SDKP or Captopril, and there was a trend towards reductions in collagen IV, \u03b1-SMA, and MCP-1 versus control. However, no significant attenuation of interstitial injury or macrophage infiltration was observed. These findings are in contrary to observations in other models and underscore the fact that a longer treatment time frame may be required to yield anti-inflammatory effects in BALB/c mice treated with Ac-SDKP compared to untreated mice.

We described trends in Medicare Part D enrollment, and compared the following 30-day and 1-year outcomes: all-cause death, all-cause readmissions, and major adverse cardiac events (a composite of all-cause death or readmission for AMI or stroke) between Part D enrollees and nonenrollees, after adjustment for patient and hospital factors. From 2007 to 2010, 29 264 (49.5%) patients with AMI enrolled in Medicare were also participating in Part D by hospital discharge. All-cause 30-day death was more common among enrollees versus nonenrollees (4.0% versus 3.3%), but this difference was not statistically significant after multivariable adjustment (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.06 [95% confidence interval, 0.97-1.17]). Enrollees also had higher unadjusted risks of 30-day all-cause readmissions or major adverse cardiac events, and 1-year mortality, all-cause readmissions, or major adverse cardiac events, but these were attenuated after multivariable adjustment. Adherence to key secondary prevention medications (statins, \u03b2-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, and P2Y12 antagonists) remained low (range, 55%-64%) at 1 year post discharge among Part D enrollees.",

Empty blister packs indicated the abuse of 250 tablets of urapidil, 42 tablets of verapamil/trandolapril, 50 tablets of moxonidin, 80 tablets of atorvastatin and 80 tablets of diacerein. Standard measures (gastric lavage, activated charcoal, mechanical ventilation, massive doses of vasopressors, volume expansion, diuretics and alkalinization) failed to provide sufficient drug elimination and hemodynamic support and the sufferer deceased on the fourth day. Dramatic elevations of serum myoglobin (34,020 \u03bcg/L) and creatine kinase (219 \u03bckat/L) were accompanied by rise in cardiac troponin I and creatinine. Gas chromatography revealed ethanol 1.17 g/kg (blood) and 2.81 g/kg (urine). Thin layer chromatography and gas chromatography of gastric content and urine verified verapamil, moxonidin and urapidil fragment (diacerein method was unavailable). Atorvastatin and trandolapril concentrations (LC-MS(n)) equaled 277.7 \u03bcg/L and 57.5 \u03bcg/L, resp. (serum) and 8.15 \u03bcg/L and 602.3 \u03bcg/L, resp. (urine). Histology confirmed precipitates of myoglobin with acute necrosis of proximal renal tubules in association with striated muscle rhabdomyolysis and myocardial dystrophy.

Nevertheless, RAS blockade has failed to show efficacy in treatment of HFpEF. We evaluated the role of RAS activation and subsequent systemic oxidation in HFpEF. Oxidative stress markers were compared in 50 subjects with and without early HFpEF. Derivatives of reactive oxidative metabolites (DROMs), F2-isoprostanes (IsoPs), and ratios of oxidized to reduced glutathione (E h GSH) and cysteine (E h CyS) were measured. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) levels and activity were measured. On univariate analysis, HFpEF was associated with male sex (p = 0.04), higher body mass index (BMI) (p = 0.003), less oxidized E h CyS (p = 0.001), lower DROMs (p = 0.02), and lower IsoP (p = 0.03). Higher BMI (OR: 1.3; 95% CI: 1.1-1.6) and less oxidized E h CyS (OR: 1.2; 95% CI: 1.1-1.4) maintained associations with HFpEF on multivariate analysis. Though ACE levels were higher in early HFpEF (OR: 1.09; 95% CI: 1.01-1.05), ACE activity was similar to that in controls. HFpEF is not associated with significant systemic RAS activation or oxidative stress. This may explain the failure of RAS inhibitors to alter outcomes in HFpEF.",

No symptoms of anaphylaxis or urticaria were present. The patient was treated intravenously with antihistamine and glucocorticoid in combination with adrenaline inhalations. After 6 h in the hospital the swelling progressed, and the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit and treated with one injection of icatibant-a bradykinin receptor antagonist. The patient reported subjective relief after 20-30 min and the swelling resolved within 2 h. Although the angio-oedema was potentially life threatening, the patient avoided intubation and mechanical ventilation.

    "469": "High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) triggers and amplifies inflammation cascade following ischemic injury, and its elevated levels are associated with adverse clinical outcomes in patients with myocardial infarction (MI). Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a key member of vasoprotective axis of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), regulates cardiovascular functions and exerts beneficial effects in cardiovascular disease. However, the association between HMGB1 and ACE2 has not been studied. We hypothesized that overexpression of ACE2 provides cardioprotective effects against MI via inhibiting HMGB1 and inflammation. ACE2 knock-in (KI) mice and littermate wild-type (WT) controls were subjected to either sham or coronary artery ligation surgery to induce MI. Heart function was assessed 4 weeks after surgery using echocardiography and Millar catheterization. Tissues were collected for histology and analysis of the expression of HMGB1, RAS components, and inflammatory cytokines. ACE2 in the heart of the ACE2 KI mice was 58-fold higher than WT controls. ACE2-MI mice exhibited a remarkable preservation of cardiac function and reduction of infarct size in comparison to WT-MI mice. Notably, ACE2 overexpression significantly reduced the MI-induced increase in apoptosis, macrophage infiltration, and HMGB1 and proinflammatory cytokine expression (TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6). Moreover, in an in vitro study, ACE2 activation prevented the hypoxia-induced cell death and upregulation of HMGB1 in adult cardiomyocytes. This protective effect is correlated with downregulation of HMGB1 and downstream proinflammatory cascades, which could be useful for the development of novel treatment for ischemic heart disease.", 
    "470": "As a consequence of both traditional and non-traditional risk factors, cardiovascular disease is over-represented, and the leading cause of mortality, among patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). Whilst recommendations for reducing cardiovascular risk in the general population exist, their applicability to the CKD population is questionable due to the exclusion of CKD patients from the majority of contemporary cardiovascular interventional studies. The aim of this review is to critically evaluate the literature regarding pharmacologic cardiovascular interventions in patients with CKD, with an emphasis on studies published since our 2008 review. Interventions discussed include erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (TREAT, U.S. Normal Hematocrit, CHOIR, CREATE, Palmer meta-analysis); statins (SHARP, AURORA, PPP, 4D, ALERT); Fibrates (VA-HIT); Folic Acid (ASFAST, US FOLIC acid trial, HOST); Antihypertensive Agents, Including Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, Beta-blockers and Combination therapy (Cice et al, FOSDIAL, Agarwal et al, ONTARGET); sevelamer (DCOR); Cinacalcet (ADVANCE, EVOLVE, Cunningham meta-analysis); Anti-oxidants (SPACE, HOPE, ATIC); Aspirin (HOT study re-analysis); vitamin D analogues (PRIMO); and multidisciplinary intervention (LANDMARK). Unfortunately, there remains a paucity of evidence in this area and a large number of methodologically poor quality studies with negative results. It is possible that these interventions do not have the same positive effect in CKD patients due to differences in the pathogenesis driving cardiovascular disease burden, such as altered bone metabolism and calcific vascular disease. Further well-designed studies with appropriately selected study populations and patient level outcomes are required. Until such time, physicians must consider on an individual patient basis the appropriateness of these interventions.", 
    "471": "Chronic activation of the myocardial renin angiotensin system (RAS) elevates the local level of angiotensin II (Ang II) thereby inducing pathological cardiac hypertrophy, which contributes to heart failure. However, the precise underlying mechanisms have not been fully delineated. Herein we report a novel paracrine mechanism between cardiac fibroblasts (CF)s and cardiomyocytes whereby Ang II induces pathological cardiac hypertrophy. In cultured CFs, Ang II treatment enhanced exosome release via the activation of Ang II receptor types 1 (AT1R) and 2 (AT2R), whereas lipopolysaccharide, insulin, endothelin (ET)-1, transforming growth factor beta (TGF\u03b2)1 or hydrogen peroxide did not. The CF-derived exosomes upregulated the expression of renin, angiotensinogen, AT1R, and AT2R, downregulated angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, and enhanced Ang II production in cultured cardiomyocytes. In addition, the CF exosome-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy was blocked by both AT1R and AT2R antagonists. Exosome inhibitors, GW4869 and dimethyl amiloride (DMA), inhibited CF-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy with little effect on Ang II-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Mechanistically, CF exosomes upregulated RAS in cardiomyocytes via the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and Akt. Finally, Ang II-induced exosome release from cardiac fibroblasts and pathological cardiac hypertrophy were dramatically inhibited by GW4869 and DMA in mice. These findings demonstrate that Ang II stimulates CFs to release exosomes, which in turn increase Ang II production and its receptor expression in cardiomyocytes, thereby intensifying Ang II-induced pathological cardiac hypertrophy. Accordingly, specific targeting of Ang II-induced exosome release from CFs may serve as a novel therapeutic approach to treat cardiac pathological hypertrophy and heart failure.",

The efficacy of olmesartan was not negatively affected by age, sex, hypertension type, diabetes status or other concomitant clinical conditions, or cardiovascular risk factors. In most cases, olmesartan provided better blood pressure control than ramipril. Olmesartan was significantly more effective than ramipril in male patients, in younger patients (aged 65-69 years), in those with metabolic syndrome, obesity, dyslipidemia, preserved renal function, diastolic \u00b1 systolic hypertension, and, in general, in patients with a high or very high cardiovascular risk. Interestingly, patients previously untreated or treated with two or more antihypertensive drugs showed a significantly larger response with olmesartan than with ramipril. Thus, our results confirm the good efficacy of olmesartan in elderly hypertensives even when new blood pressure targets for antihypertensive treatment are considered. Such results may be relevant for the clinical practice, providing some hint on the possible different response of elderly hypertensive patients to two different drugs acting on the renin-angiotensin system, when patients are targeted according to the blood pressure levels recommended by recent hypertension guidelines.",

This discovery provided an important missing piece in our understanding of the pathomechanism of filter barrier damage, revealing Ca(2+) signaling as critical for podocyte health and disease. The identification of the two Ca(2+) permeant channels TRPC5 and TRPC6 as mediators of this pathway not only bolstered the importance of podocyte cytoskeleton dynamics but also revealed promising drug targets for treatment-resistant nephrotic syndrome.

Adult male SHR were treated with enalapril (E+L) or tap water (C+L) for 2 weeks followed by a 2-week washout period. Rats were then subjected to 0, 3, 7 or 10 days of L-NAME treatment. The temporal response to NOS inhibition was evaluated by measuring arterial pressure, cardiac remodeling and cytokine/chemokine levels. L-NAME equivalently increased blood pressure and myocardial and vascular injury in C+L and E+L rats. However, pulse pressure (PP) was only transiently altered in C+L rats. The levels of several inflammatory mediators were increased during L-NAME treatment. However, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-10 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 were uniquely increased in C+L hearts; whereas IL-4 and fractalkine were only elevated in E+L hearts. By days 7 and 10 of L-NAME treatment, there was a significant increase in the cardiac density of macrophages and proliferating cells, respectively only in C+L rats. Although myocardial injury was similar in both treatment groups, PP was not changed and there was a distinct cardiac chemokine/cytokine signature in rats previously treated with enalapril that may be related to the lack of proliferative response and macrophage infiltration in these hearts.",

Reducing the inflammatory burden is also necessary to lower the cardiovascular risk. An adequate control of disease activity and cerebrovascular risk assessment using national guidelines should be recommended for all patients with RA. For patients with a documented history of cerebrovascular or cardiovascular risk factors, smoking cessation and corticosteroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs at the lowest dose possible are crucial. Risk score models should be adapted for patients with RA by introducing a 1.5 multiplication factor, and their results interpreted to appropriately direct clinical care. Statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin-II receptor blockers are preferred treatment options. Biologic and non-biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs should be initiated early to mitigate the necessity of symptom control drugs and to achieve early alleviation of the inflammatory state.

We used comparative proteomics analysis of Fbln4(SMKO) aortas from postnatal day (P) 1 to P30 mice to identify key molecules involved in aneurysm initiation and expansion. At P14, the actin depolymerizing factor cofilin was dephosphorylated and thus activated, and at P7, the abundance of slingshot-1 (SSH1) phosphatase, an activator of cofilin, was increased, leading to actin cytoskeletal remodeling. Also, by P7, biomechanical changes and underdeveloped elastic lamina-SMC connections were evident, and the abundance of early growth response 1 (Egr1), a mechanosensitive transcription factor that stimulates ACE expression, was increased, which was before the increases in ACE abundance and cofilin activation. Postnatal deletion of Fbln4 in SMCs at P7 prevented cofilin activation and aneurysm formation, suggesting that these processes required disruption of elastic lamina-SMC connections. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) is involved in the angiotensin II-mediated activation of SSH1, and administration of PI3K inhibitors from P7 to P30 decreased SSH1 abundance and prevented aneurysms. These results suggest that aneurysm formation arises from abnormal mechanosensing of SMCs resulting from the loss of elastic lamina-SMC connections and from increased SSH1 and cofilin activity, which may be potential therapeutic targets for treating ascending aortic aneurysms.",

Urinary levels were associated to cardiovascular and renal injury, assessed by histopathology. The origin of urinary KLK9 was investigated through in situ renal perfusion experiments.The urinary excretion of KLK9 is increased in different experimental models of hypertension in rats. The ACE inhibitor trandolapril significantly reduced arterial pressure and the urinary level of KLK9. Hypertension did not increase kidney, heart, liver, lung, or plasma KLK9 levels. Hypertension-induced increased urinary excretion of KLK9 results from specific alterations in its tubular reabsorption, even in the absence of overt nephropathy. KLK9 urinary excretion strongly correlates with cardiac hypertrophy and aortic wall thickening.KLK9 appears in the urine in the presence of hypertension as a result of subtle renal handling alterations.

This review summarizes current knowledge regarding flavonoid C-glycosides and their influence on human health. Among the flavonoid C-glycosides, flavone C-glycosides, especially vitexin, isoorientin, orientin, isovitexin and their multiglycosides are more frequently mentioned than others. Flavonoid C-monoglycosides are poorly absorbed in human beings with very few metabolites in urine and blood and are deglycosylated and degraded by human intestinal bacteria in colon. However, flavonoid C-multiglycosides are absorbed unchanged in the intestine and distributed to other tissues. Flavonoid C-glycosides showed significant antioxidant activity, anticancer and antitumor activity, hepatoprotective activity, anti-inflammatory activity, anti-diabetes activity, antiviral activity, antibacterial and antifungal activity, and other biological effects.

Intrauterine growth restriction programs hypertension and enhance renal sensitivity to acute angiotensin II in male growth-restricted rats. Endothelin is reported to work synergistically with angiotensin II. Thus, this study tested the hypothesis that endothelin augments the blood pressure response to acute angiotensin II in male growth-restricted rats. Systemic and renal hemodynamics were determined in response to acute angiotensin II (100 mg/kg per minute for 30 minutes) with and without the endothelin type-A receptor antagonist, Atrasentan (ABT-627; 10 ng/kg per minute for 30 minutes), in rats pretreated with enalapril (250 mg/L for 1 week) to normalize the endogenous renin-angiotensin system. Endothelin type-A receptor blockade reduced angiotensin II-mediated increases in blood pressure in male control and male growth-restricted rats. Endothelin type-A receptor blockade also abolished hyper-responsiveness to acute angiotensin II in male growth-restricted rats. Yet, blood pressure remained significantly elevated above baseline after endothelin type-A receptor blockade, suggesting that factors in addition to endothelin contribute to the basic angiotensin II-induced pressor response in male rats. We also determined sex-specific effects of endothelin on acute angiotensin II-mediated hemodynamic responses. Endothelin type-A receptor blockade did not reduce acute angiotensin II-mediated increases in blood pressure in female control or growth-restricted rats, intact or ovariectomized. Thus, these data suggest that endothelin type-A receptor blockade contributes to hypersensitivity to acute angiotensin II in male growth-restricted rats and further supports the sex-specific effect of endothelin on blood pressure.",

AKI is potentially reversible so improvements in its recognition and early interventions could have a major impact on patient outcomes. AKI occurs when there is a rapid decrease in GFR within hours to days. The loss of kidney function results in the retention of urea and creatinine and subsequent dysregulation of electrolytes and fluid balance. Individuals in the community with pre-existing CKD and/or patients treated with an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker are at increased risk of AKI if they develop an illness associated with hypovolaemia or hypotension. Potential clues in the history for AKI include reduced fluid intake and/or increased fluid losses, urinary tract symptoms and recent drug ingestion. Postural changes in pulse and BP are more sensitive indicators of hypovolaemia than supine observations. Once an unexplained raised serum creatinine is identified this should trigger a careful review of the patient's history including the common AKI risk factors, medication record, baseline renal function and clinical examination. The severity of the AKI should be considered by evaluating the extent of rise of serum creatinine from baseline. Reagent strip urinalysis should be performed, if possible, on any patient with suspected AKI. Positive protein and blood indicators of 2+ to 4+ on urinalysis suggest intrinsic glomerular disease and should trigger more urgent referral to hospital. The focus of AKI management is correcting the conditions causing or contributing to it.",

Initial recommendations include diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and calcium channel blockers; beta blockers are favored in some guidelines and are a choice in specific settings. Within the classes of drugs, several antihypertensive agents provide options. This review discusses antihypertensive drugs by class, including adverse effects and tolerability, with preferences in older adults and specific settings. Adverse drug events from antihypertensive medications are discussed by class and where applicable for specific agents. Data from select studies pertinent to tolerability and adverse effects are presented in tables for several classes of drugs. The rationale for nonadherence to medication is reviewed, including the roles played by tolerability and adverse drug effects. Antihypertensive therapy in typical settings in older adults is discussed; they include hypertension in association with impaired cognition, depression, diabetes, sexual dysfunction, and falls. The key to successful therapy and tolerability is to promote a healthy lifestyle in conjunction with medications as the approach, thereby also lowering the adverse drug effects. The eventual choice of the specific drug(s) is based on risks, benefits, and patient preferences, and is best tailored for each older adult.",

Drug regimens should be reviewed to ensure that patients are taking appropriate drugs, including antiplatelet agents, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers, aldosterone antagonists, beta blockers/calcium channel blockers, cholesterol-lowering drugs, and nitroglycerin. The review also should confirm that patients understand when and how to take their drugs, and that there are no obstacles (eg, cost) that might result in nonadherence to drug regimens. Lifestyle modifications, including improvements in diet and exercise regimens, along with participation in a cardiac rehabilitation program, should be encouraged. Risk factor reduction measures include smoking cessation for smokers, weight management for patients who are overweight, and optimal control of blood pressure and blood glucose levels. Appropriate vaccinations should be administered; influenza and pneumococcal vaccines are indicated for all patients with ACS in the absence of contraindications. Patients requiring pain control should avoid use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs because they increase the risk of cardiovascular events; acetaminophen or other drugs should be used. Finally, depression is common among patients with ACS. Screening for and management of depression are significant components of care.",

For STEMI, the initial approach to management is cardiac catheterization with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to reperfuse the blocked artery; PCI should take place within 120 minutes of first medical contact. However, if no contraindications are present, fibrinolytic therapy is preferred if PCI will take more than 120 minutes. In ACS without STEMI, cardiac catheterization with PCI is the recommended approach for patients who are unstable, and for stable patients with high risk assessment scores, diabetes or renal insufficiency, stent placement within the past 6 months, or prior bypass surgery. Treatment of patients with ACS who do not meet the previously discussed criteria can be noninvasive when troponin levels are not elevated, no ST-segment elevations or depressions are present on electrocardiogram, and risk assessment scores are low. Assuming no contraindications exist, all patients with or without STEMI should receive medical therapy that includes nitroglycerin, antiplatelet agents, anticoagulants, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers, aldosterone blockade if left ventricular function is impaired, beta blockers, and statins.",

The optimization of the reaction conditions such as the solvent, reagent concentration, and reaction time were investigated. Under the optimum conditions, the fluorescence quenching was linear over a concentration range of 1.0-6.0\u00a0\u03bcg/mL. The proposed method was fully validated and successfully applied to the analysis of perindopril erbumine in pure form and tablets.

Women were older and more likely to have risk factors for atherosclerosis, history of heart failure (HF), and rheumatic heart and valve disease. Ischemic heart disease was the prime cause for HF in men and women but more so in men (P < .001). Women had higher rates of hypertensive heart disease and primary valve disease (P < .001, for both comparisons). Men were more likely to have severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction. On discharge, a higher use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, \u03b2-blockers, and aldosterone inhibitors was observed in men (P < .001 for all comparisons). Apart from higher atrial fibrillation in women and higher ventricular arrhythmias in men, no differences were observed in hospital outcomes.

Some significant additional clinical benefits in slowing the progression of DN was reported from the Remission clinic experience, where simultaneous intensive control of BP, tight glycaemic control, weight loss, exercise and smoking cessation were prioritised in the management of DN. This has not proved possible to translate to more conventional clinical settings. This review briefly looks over the history and limitations of current therapy from landmark papers and expert reviews, and following an extensive PubMed search identifies the most promising clinical biomarkers (both established and proposed).

However, converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-is) and angiotensin receptor blockers do not always achieve the desired target of proteinuria. The induction of the prorenin and renin up-regulation is a possible explanation. Aliskiren is the first drug acting as direct inhibitor of plasmatic renin activity, also able to interfere with the prorenin and renin profibrotic escape. We aimed at reviewing the literature for the assessment of potential efficacy and safety of aliskiren in the treatment of non-diabetic glomerulonephritis. The data on this topic are limited; however, we concluded for a possible usefulness of aliskiren. The renal safety profile appears potentially acceptable in non-diabetic patients although extreme carefulness, particularly with respect to long-term renal and cardiovascular tolerability, is recommended.",

This research was conducted on Han recruits, who travelled to the Lhasa plateau (altitude, 3658 m). Ten loci located on ten genes extracted from the HAPE and healthy populations were amplified by polymerase chain reaction, and subsequently sequenced. The investigated genes included those coding for aldosterone synthase 2 (CYP11B2), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), heat-shock protein 70 (HSP70), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB), surfactant protein A2 (SP-A2), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), nitric oxide synthetase (NOS), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), prolyl hydroxylase (EGLN1), and zinc finger protein A20. The gene distribution of each SNP loci and its correlation with HAPE was analyzed. Statistical analyses of the genotype frequencies of the SNPs revealed significant differences in the ACE (rs4309), EGLN1 (rs480902), SP-A2 (rs1965708), HSP70 (rs1008438), PAI-1 (rs1799889), and NOS (rs199983) expressions between the HAPE and healthy control groups (P < 0.05); therefore, these SNP loci were believed to indicate HAPE susceptibility. HAPE is correlated with multiple- SNP loci. A correlation analysis between genetic polymorphism and HAPE susceptibility revealed that 6 hypoxia-related genes were key sites accounting for HAPE. These findings could help assess the risk of HAPE in populations expressing different genotypes, in order to reduce the occurrence of HAPE.",

The effect of elicitation on the protein profile and antioxidant and angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activities of sprouted lentils was also evaluated. The application of elicitors did not negatively affect the germination yield of lentils and no significant changes on the protein pattern of lentils germinated in the presence of elicitors were observed. Chitosan/glutamic acid increased by 1.6-fold the GABA content in lentil sprouts, whilst ascorbic and folic acids as well as chitosan/glutamic acid were highly effective to enhance the total content of phenolic compounds and the antioxidant activity of sprouted lentils. All elicited lentil sprouts showed ability to inhibit ACE activity (IC50: 9.5-11.9 \u03bcg peptides/mL). Therefore, elicitation can be considered a promising approach to improve the content of compounds with antioxidant and potential antihypertensive activities in lentil sprouts.", 
    "638": "The aim of the present study was to determine whether long-term high salt intake in the drinking water induces hypertension in wild-type (WT) mice and whether a chymase inhibitor or other antihypertensive drugs could reverse the increase of blood pressure. Eight-week-old male WT mice were supplied with drinking water containing 2% salt for 12 wk (high-salt group) or high-salt drinking water plus an oral chymase inhibitor (TPC-806) at four different doses (25, 50, 75, or 100 mg/kg), captopril (75 mg/kg), losartan (100 mg/kg), hydrochlorothiazide (3 mg/kg), eplerenone (200 mg/kg), or amlodipine (6 mg/kg). Control groups were given normal water with or without the chymase inhibitor. Blood pressure and heart rate gradually showed a significant increase in the high-salt group, whereas a dose-dependent depressor effect of the chymase inhibitor was observed. There was also partial improvement of hypertension in the losartan- and eplerenone-treated groups but not in the captopril-, hydrochlorothiazide-, and amlodipine-treated groups. A high salt load significantly increased chymase-dependent ANG II-forming activity in the alimentary tract. In addition, the relative contribution of chymase to ANG II formation, but not actual average activity, showed a significant increase in skin and skeletal muscle, whereas angiotensin-converting enzyme-dependent ANG II-forming activity and its relative contribution were reduced by high salt intake. Plasma and urinary renin-angiotensin system components were significantly increased in the high-salt group but were significantly suppressed in the chymase inhibitor-treated group. In conclusion, 2% salt water drinking for 12 wk caused moderate hypertension and activated the renin-angiotensin system in WT mice. A chymase inhibitor suppressed both the elevation of blood pressure and heart rate, indicating a definite involvement of chymase in salt-sensitive hypertension.", 
    "639": "Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is regarded as acute tubular necrosis resulting from the cytotoxicity of contrast media and the medullary hypoxia linking to the interplay of vasoconstriction and vasodilatation. Saline infusion may prevent CIN by inhibiting renin release and thus production of angiotensin II (ANG II), a vasoconstrictor, from angiotensin I (ANG I). Yet the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) yields conflicting results in the prevention of CIN. We hypothesise that ACEI will be useful for CIN prevention when the saline infusion is insufficient, useless when the saline infusion is sufficient, and counterproductive when the saline infusion is excessive, respectively. When the production of ANG I and thus ANG II is insufficiently inhibited by insufficient saline infusion, ACEI may help prevent CIN by conferring extra inhibition on the production of ANG II from ANG I. The counterproductive effect may result from ACEI blocking the generation of angiotensin 1-7, a potent vasodilator, from angiotensin 1-9 whose precursor, ANG I, is excessively diminished by excessive saline infusion. Clinical data suggest that normal saline infusion at a rate of 1 ml/kg/h for 12 h, 1 ml/kg/h for 6 h, and 2 ml/kg/h for 6 h before and after contrast injection provide sufficient, insufficient, and excessive hydration in the prevention of CIN, respectively. The mainstream guideline is to stop ACEI and provide sufficient hydration for CIN prevention. Alternatively one may continue to have ACEI but the use of normal saline infusion must be limited to 1 ml/kg/h for 6 h before and after contrast injection.", 
    "640": "Angiotensin II (ANG II) is known to promote leptin production and secretion. Although ANG II type 1 receptors (AT1Rs) and leptin are expressed within the carotid body, it is not known whether AT1R and leptin are co-expressed in the same glomus cells nor if these peptides are affected within the carotid body by intermittent hypoxia (IH). This study was done to investigate whether ANG II modulated leptin signaling in the carotid body during IH. Rats were treated with captopril (Capt) or the AT1R blocker losartan (Los) in the drinking water for 3days prior to being exposed to IH (8h) or normoxia (8h). IH induced increases in plasma ANG II and leptin compared to normoxic controls. Capt treatment abolished the plasma leptin changes to IH, whereas Los treatment had no effect on the IH induced increase in plasma leptin. Additionally, carotid body glomus cells containing both leptin and the long form of the leptin receptor (OB-Rb) were found to co-express AT1R protein, and IH increased the expression of only AT1R protein within the carotid body in both Capt- and non-Capt-treated animals. On the other hand, Los treatment did not modify AT1R protein expression to IH. Additionally, Capt and Los treatment eliminated the elevated carotid body leptin protein expression, and the changes in phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription three protein, the short form of the leptin receptor (OB-R100), suppressor of cytokine signaling 3, and phosphorylated extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2 protein expression induced by IH. However, Capt elevated the expression of OB-Rb protein, whereas Los abolished the changes in OB-Rb protein to IH. These findings, taken together with the previous observation that ANG II modifies carotid body chemosensitivity, suggest that the increased circulating levels of ANG II and leptin induced by IH act at the carotid body to alter leptin signaling within the carotid body which in turn may influence chemoreceptor function.",

Validation procedure included specificity, sensitivity, robustness, stability, linearity, precision and accuracy. The method was used for the dissolution test of perindopril and indapamide in three fixed-dose formulations. The dissolution procedure was optimized using different media, different pH of the buffer, surfactants, paddle speed and temperature. Similarity of dissolution profiles was estimated using different model-independent and model-dependent methods and, additionally, by principal component analysis (PCA). Also, some kinetic models were checked for dissolved amounts of drugs as a function of time.",

    "645": "Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a primary cause of morbidity and mortality with an increasing prevalence in human and canine populations. Recognition of the role of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) overactivation in the pathophysiology of CHF has led to significant medical advances. By decreasing systemic vascular resistance and angiotensin II (AII) production, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors such as benazepril improve cardiac hemodynamics and reduce mortality in human and dog CHF patients. Although several experiments have pointed out that efficacy of ACE inhibitors depends on the time of administration, little attention is paid to the optimum time of dosing of these medications. A thorough characterization of the chronobiology of the renin cascade has the potential to streamline the therapeutic management of RAAS-related diseases and to help determining the optimal time of drug administration that maximizes efficacy of ACE inhibitors, while minimizing the occurrence of adverse effects. We have developed an integrated pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model that adequately captures the disposition kinetics of the paradigm drug benazeprilat, as well as the time-varying changes of systemic renin-angiotensin-aldosterone biomarkers, without and with ACE inhibition therapy. Based on these chronobiological investigations, the optimal efficacy of ACE inhibitors is expected with bedtime dosing. The data further show that benazepril influences the dynamics of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone cascade, resulting in a profound decrease in AII and aldosterone (ALD), while increasing renin activity for about 24\u00a0h. From the results of recent investigations in human, it is hypothesized that reduction of AII and ALD is one of the drivers of increased survival and improved quality of life in dogs receiving ACE inhibitors. To support and consolidate this hypothesis, additional efforts should be directed toward the collection of circulating RAAS peptides in spontaneous cases of canine CHF. If such a link could be established, profiling of these biomarkers could support determination of the severity of heart failure, complement clinical and echocardiographic findings, and be used for therapeutic drug monitoring purposes.", 
    "646": "The ability to protect hyaluronic acid (HA) from oxidative degradation by cupric ions and ascorbate (production of (\u2022)OH and peroxy-type radicals) during acute phase joint inflammation has been investigated using the following drugs: tiopronin, captopril, and levamisole. Radical scavenging activity, i.e. the propensity for donation of electrons was assessed for the drugs by ABTS and DPPH assays. The kinetics of HA degradation have been measured in the presence of each drug using rotational viscometry. The results of ABTS and DPPH assays show the highest radical scavenging activity for captopril, followed by tiopronin. For levamisole, no effect was observed. Captopril and tiopronin prevented HA degradation induced by (\u2022)OH radicals in a similar manner, while tiopronin was more effective in scavenging peroxy-type radicals. On the other hand, levamisole was shown to be a pro-oxidant. Recovered HA fragments were characterized using FT-IR analysis, the incorporation of a sulphur atom from captopril and tiopronin but not from levamisole into the HA molecule was demonstrated.",

Demonstrated commitment to the basic principles of medical verification of cardiovascular events with an adequate definition of risk SCORE scale for patients with high and very high risk. However, the lack of definition of fractions of cholesterol is not allowed to make the right decision on the appointment of GLT for a number of patients with low and moderate risk. The advantage in the appointment of atorvastatin used (32.3%), simvastatin (27.8%) and rosuvastatin (20.9%), and from the antihypertensive subgroups - angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, -blockers, calcium antagonists, sartan. Revealed insufficient control of blood lipid in the dynamics on the background of LLT, low activity of doctors in the statin dose titration and use of combined LLT (6.9%) in order to achieve target levels of atherogenic key biochemical parameters. Taking into account the literature data on the most effective and priorities destination rosuvastatin and its high safety in clinical situations of forced polypharmacy we conducted pharmacoeconomic comparison of rosuvastatin several manufacturers of direct cost. Established a price advantage of rosuvastatin (tevastor) with respect to both the original drug, and to a number specified in the prescribing of generics. No fixed assignment LLT is testimony not revealed irrational combinations of drugs with contraindications recommendations, including the appointment of antihypertensive drugs.",

    "671": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of erectile dysfunction (ED) in a cohort of Italian hypertensive men and the association with clinical and biochemical data. The study involved 270 consecutive hypertensive subjects aged 40-70 years evaluated in Italian Hypertension Centers of six hospitals from Liguria and Piedmont. ED was assessed through the self-administered questionnaire of the International Index of Erectile Function. Clinical history with ongoing drug treatment, various clinical parameters, biochemical data and evidence about the presence of subclinical target organ damage was collected. Twenty-seven subjects refused to answer the questionnaire (10%). Among the 243 remained subjects, 123 presented ED (50.6%). ED was highly related to age, systolic blood pressure, pulse pressure, smoking status, statin therapy and kidney function. The addition of a thiazide diuretic to an inhibitor of the renin-angiotensin system significantly increased the prevalence of ED. The prevalence of ED increased in relation with the number of hypotensive drug classes taken by the patients. ED was highly prevalent in this cohort of Italian hypertensive subjects and was associated with other cardiovascular risk factors, such as age, smoking status and kidney function. The role of ED as an early marker of cardiovascular disease is discussed.", 
    "672": "Hypertension is common and occurs in the majority of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) patients prior to loss of kidney function. Hypertension relates to progressive kidney enlargement, and is a significant independent risk factor for progression to end-stage renal disease. The pathogenesis of hypertension in ADPKD is complex and depends on many factors that influence each other. High expression of PKD1 and PKD2 genes is present in the cilia of tubular epithelial cells, in endothelial cells and in vascular smooth muscle cells. Decreased or absent polycystin-1 or -2 expression is associated with abnormal vascular structure and function. PKD1/PKD2 deficiency results in reduced nitric oxide levels, altered endothelial response to shear stress with attenuation in vascular relaxation. Activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system occurs in ADPKD due to decreased nitric oxide production as well as bilateral cyst expansion and intra-renal ischemia. With increasing cyst size, further activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system occurs, blood pressure increases and a vicious cycle ensues with enhanced cyst growth and hypertension ultimately leading to end-stage renal disease. Inhibition of the angiotensin-aldosterone system is possible with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and seems to be the first-line treatment for hypertension in these subjects. As suggested by the HALT-PKD study, an aggressive blood pressure control is safe and recommended and is associated with preservation of kidney function and a reduction in total kidney volume over time. A collaborative multidisciplinary approach between nephrologists and cardiologists is necessary for the monitoring of kidney and heart complications.",

Emerging evidence suggests that FFP and medications approved for management of acute attacks of hereditary angioedema, another bradykinin-mediated event, may be effective for use in ACEI-IA. Positive efficacy results were reported with FFP and C1-INH while mixed results have been seen with ecallantide. Off-label icatibant has the most evidence supporting its use in ACEI-IA with rapid symptom resolution (10 minutes to 6 hours) and avoidance of intubation and tracheotomy in several cases. These agents were well-tolerated in ACEI-IA.",

First-line therapies include ACEI discontinuation, observation, and supportive medications (eg, corticosteroids, antihistamines, and epinephrine). Symptom progression can be life-threatening and may require interventions such as tracheotomy and intubation. Off-label use of FFP and medications approved for hereditary angioedema have resulted in rapid resolution of symptoms and avoidance of intubation. Among these agents, icatibant has the most supporting evidence and has been incorporated into practice guidelines and algorithms as a second-line agent for serious life-threatening ACE-IA.",

Overall FMD and NMD were significantly impaired after 1 week. However, deterioration of FMD and NMD was observed in 67% and 71% of patients, respectively. Absolute change in FMD was significantly different in patients using a renin- angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitor compared to those who were not (1.9 \u00b1 12.9 vs. -7.7 \u00b1 \u00b1 12.7%, respectively, p = 0.025). Additionally, there was a moderate but significant correlation between baseline RA diameter and absolute change in NMD (r = 0.419, p < 0.001). RAS blockade was independently associated with protection against FMD deterioration (OR 0.241, 95% CI 0.066-0.883, p = 0.032), whereas RA diameter (OR 0.079, 95% CI 0.009-0.720, p = 0.024) and procedure time (OR 1.156, 95% CI 0.989-1.350, p = 0.068) were associated with NMD deterioration, although the latter had borderline significance.", 
    "681": "Vasodilatory function of RA gets impaired in most patients following transradial procedures. RAS blockade seems to exert a protective role against deteriorating endothelium- dependent vasodilation, whereas smaller RA diameter and potentially longer procedure time are associated with impaired endothelium-independent vasodilation.",

    "686": "Although HF has multiple causes amongst which coronary artery disease, hypertension and non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy are the most common, it results in the same final common pathway of neurohormonal activation and multiorgan dysfunction in the context of a salt-avid state. Contemporary pharmacologic HF therapy targets neurohormonal activation at multiple levels with \u03b2- blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and aldosterone inhibitors, aiming in reversing both its systemic consequences, and the adverse heart remodeling, however is frequently hampered by side effects of the drugs, limiting its benefit. During the last 40 years studies of the gross and molecular aspects of the pathophysiology of HF convincingly converge to the conclusion that deranged calcium (Ca(2+)) handling in the cardiomyocytes plays a cardinal role in HF initiation and progression. The delicate and precise regulation of Ca(2+) cycling i.e. movement into and out of the cell, as well as into and out of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), is finely tuned by numerous macromolecular proteins and regulatory processes like phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, and is severely deranged in HF. The common denominator in this scenario is Ca(2+) depletion of the SR, however loading of cardiomyocytes with Ca(2+) as a result of classic inotropic therapy has proved to be detrimental in the long term. Therefore, the mediator and/or regulatory components of the Ca(2+) cycling apparatus have been the focus of extensive research involving targeted pharmacologic and gene interventions aiming to a restoration of Ca(2+) cycling processes, thus improving inotropy and lucitropy in a more \"physiologic\" way in the failing myocardium.", 
    "687": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-induced angioedema is a rare, albeit serious emergency that can result in airway compromise and potentially death if not treated promptly. Currently, there are no agents approved by the Food and Drug Administration to target ACE inhibitor angioedema and to prevent intubation. C1 inhibitors are approved for hereditary angioedema but may show promise in alleviating inflammation associated with ACE inhibitor angioedema.", 
    "688": "A 41-year-old man presented to the emergency department with swelling of his lips a few days after starting lisinopril for hypertension. Despite receiving diphenhydramine, ranitidine, and methylprednisolone, the swelling progressed to the patient's tongue. A C1 inhibitor was ordered in an effort to prevent intubation. Before the arrival of the medication, the patient was intubated emergently for airway protection. After receipt of the C1 inhibitor, the swelling dramatically improved, and the patient was successfully extubated after less than 18 hours from presentation. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: This case illustrates a potential role for C1 inhibitors in the emergency setting for treating drug-induced angioedema, which may prevent or minimize mechanical ventilation time.",

In this cross-sectional study after two initial BP measurements, patients were identified as eligible for the study. An initial electrocardiogram was obtained and blood samples were drawn. A total of 212 patients were accepted as eligible for the study, and 25\u00a0mg of captopril was randomly given orally or sublingually; BP was measured at 10, 30, and 60\u00a0min. We selected the patients to the groups consecutively. A 25% reduction of initial BP 1\u00a0h after initiation of the treatment was accepted as an accomplishment. A second 25\u00a0mg of captopril was given if the target of 25% reduction of BP was not reached after the first tablet.

Paulo, Brazil on June 28th and the second is the celebration of Dr. Regoli's 60 years of research on vasoactive peptides. The cardiovascular homeostasis derives from a balance of two systems, the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and the kallikrein-kinin system (KKS). The biologically active effector entity of RAS is angiotensin receptor-1 (AT-1R), and that of KKS is bradykinin B2 receptor (B2R). The first mediates vasoconstriction, the second is the most potent and efficient vasodilator. Thanks to its complex and multi-functional mechanism of action, involving nitric oxide (NO), prostacyclin and endothelial hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF). B2R is instrumental for the supply of blood, oxygen and nutrition to tissues. KKS is present on the vascular endothelium and functions as an autacoid playing major roles in cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and diabetes. KKS exerts a paramount role in the prevention of thrombosis and atherosclerosis. Such knowledge emphasizes the already prominent value of the ACE-inhibitors (ACEIs) for the treatment of CVDs and diabetes. Indeed, the ACEIs, thanks to their double action (block of the RAS and potentiation of the KKS) are the ideal agents for a rational treatment of these diseases.", 
    "695": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of perindopril or barnidipine alone or combined with simvastatin on metabolic parameters and hepatic steatosis degree. One hundred and forty nine mild to moderate hypertensive, normocholesterolemic, overweight or obese outpatients with hepatic steatosis were enrolled. They were treated with perindopril 5mg/day, or barnidipine, 20mg/day, for 6 months; subsequently simvastatin, 20mg/day was added to both treatments for further 6 months. Blood pressure variation was recorded. Patients also underwent an ultrasound examination, at baseline and after 6, and 12 months. We also assessed: fasting plasma glucose (FPG), fasting plasma insulin (FPI), lipid profile, adiponectin (ADN), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (\u03a4\u039dF-\u03b1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), high-sensitivity C reactive protein (Hs-CRP). Both perindopril and barnidipine reduced blood pressure, with barnidipine being more effective. Barnidipine, but not perindopril, slightly decreased total cholesterol and triglycerides after 6 months compared to baseline; lipid profile improved in both groups when simvastatin was added. Regarding inflammatory parameters, barnidipine reduced TNF-a, IL-6, and Hs-CRP, both in monotherapy, and after simvastatin addition. Hepatic steatosis parameters improved only when simvastatin was added. We can conclude that barnidipine better reduced blood pressure compared to perindopril and inflammatory parameters. Regarding hepatic steatosis parameters, only the addition of simvastatin improved them.",

    "697": "Skeletal muscle responds to endurance exercise with an improvement of biochemical pathways that support substrate supply and oxygen-dependent metabolism. This is reflected by enhanced expression of associated factors after exercise and is specifically modulated by tissue perfusion and oxygenation. We hypothesized that transcript expression of pro-angiogenic factors (VEGF, tenascin-C, Angpt1, Angpt1R) and oxygen metabolism (COX4I1, COX4I2, HIF-1\u03b1) in human muscle after an endurance stimulus depends on vasoconstriction, and would be modulated through angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition by intake of lisinopril. Fourteen non-specifically trained, male Caucasians subjects, carried out a single bout of standardized one-legged bicycle exercise. Seven of the participants consumed lisinopril in the 3 days before exercise. Biopsies were collected pre- and 3\u2009h post-exercise from the m. vastus lateralis. COX4I1 (P\u2009=\u20090.03), COX4I2 (P\u2009=\u20090.04) mRNA and HIF-1\u03b1 (P\u2009=\u20090.05) mRNA and protein levels (P\u2009=\u20090.01) showed an exercise-induced increase in the group not consuming the ACE inhibitor. Conversely, there was a specific exercise-induced increase in VEGF transcript (P\u2009=\u20090.04) and protein levels (P\u2009=\u20090.03) and a trend for increased tenascin-c transcript levels (P\u2009=\u20090.09) for subjects consuming lisinopril. The observations indicate that exercise-induced expression of transcripts involved in angiogenesis and mitochondrial energy metabolism are to some extent regulated via a hypoxia-related ACE-dependent mechanism.",

It is a rare but life-threatening complication. This formerly serious complication has got a considerable brighter outlook since the introduction of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE) however the mortality is still remaining high. We report two cases of SRC which to our knowledge are the firsts described in Dakar. They were two women aged 45 and 32 years, one of them was previously following for systemic sclerosis. Both of them had malignant hypertension associated with rapidly progressive renal failure, the other was put under corticosteroid therapy four months before SRC occurrence. The histological and laboratory finding showed thrombotic microangiopathy. The height blood pressure returned to normal value after treatment with ACE inhibitors.

Broad use of the latter, such as spironolactone, has been limited by significant incidence of gynecomastia and other sex-related adverse effects. These problems can be overcome with use of eplerenone, a selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. Eplerenone has been specifically developed to bind selectively to the mineralocorticoid receptors in order to minimize binding to the progesterone and androgen receptors. In the last decade, multiple scientific evidences have been accumulated showing the efficacy and safety of the drug in multiple clinical conditions, including heart failure and arterial hypertension. Eplerenone is generally well tolerated, with the most frequent adverse event being hyperkalemia, with sexual adverse events (i.e. gynecomastia) being more uncommon, due to the selectivity of eplerenone. This review focuses on the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of eplerenone, thus providing the scientific basis to fully understand drug-to-drug interactions, in particular, and its efficacy and tolerability, in general. Noteworthy, the activity of eplerenone in special conditions and different patient populations is summarized.", 
    "704": "Hypertension is one of the major risk factor able to promote development and progression of several cardiovascular diseases, including left ventricular hypertrophy and dysfunction, myocardial infarction, stroke, and congestive heart failure. Also, it is one of the major driven of high cardiovascular risk profile in patients with metabolic complications, including obesity, metabolic syndrome and diabetes, as well as in those with renal disease. Thus, effective control of hypertension is a key factor for any preventing strategy aimed at reducing the burden of hypertension-related cardiovascular diseases in the clinical practice. Among various regulatory and contra-regulatory systems involved in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular and renal diseases, renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a major role. However, despite the identification of renin and the availability of various assays for measuring its plasma activity, the specific pathophysiological role of RAS has not yet fully characterized. In the last years, however, several notions on the RAS have been improved by the results of large, randomized clinical trials, performed in different clinical settings and in different populations treated with RAS inhibiting drugs, including angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and antagonists of the AT1 receptor for angiotensin II (ARBs). These findings suggest that the RAS should be considered to have a central role in the pathogenesis of different cardiovascular diseases, for both therapeutic and preventive purposes, without having to measure its level of activation in each patient. The present document will discuss the most critical issues of the pathogenesis of different cardiovascular diseases with a specific focus on RAS blocking agents, including ACE inhibitors and ARBs, in the light of the most recent evidence supporting the use of these drugs in the clinical management of hypertension and hypertension-related cardiovascular diseases.",

More recently, the tetrapetide N-acetyl-Ser-Asp-Lys-Pro (Ac-SDKP) has emerged as a potent antifibrotic agent and negative regulator of haematopoietic stem cell differentiation which is processed exclusively by ACE. Here we provide a detailed biochemical and structural basis for the domain preference of Ac-SDKP. The high resolution crystal structures of N-domain ACE in complex with the dipeptide products of Ac-SDKP cleavage were obtained and offered a template to model the mechanism of substrate recognition of the enzyme. A comprehensive kinetic study of Ac-SDKP and domain co-operation was performed and indicated domain interactions affecting processing of the tetrapeptide substrate. Our results further illustrate the molecular basis for N-domain selectivity and should help design novel ACE inhibitors and Ac-SDKP analogues that could be used in the treatment of fibrosis disorders.",

    "711": "Cardiovascular disease, including cardiac hypertrophy, is common in patients with kidney disease and can be partially attenuated using blockers of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). It is unknown whether cardiac microRNAs contribute to the pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy or to the protective effect of RAS blockade in kidney disease. Using a subtotal nephrectomy rat model of kidney injury, we investigated changes in cardiac microRNAs that are known to have direct target genes involved in the regulation of apoptosis, fibrosis, and hypertrophy. The effect of treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor ramipril on cardiac microRNAs was also investigated. Kidney injury led to a significant increase in cardiac microRNA-212 and microRNA-132 expression. Ramipril reduced cardiac hypertrophy, attenuated the increase in microRNA-212 and microRNA-132, and significantly increased microRNA-133 and microRNA-1 expression. There was altered expression of caspase-9, B cell lymphoma-2, transforming growth factor-\u03b2, fibronectin 1, collagen type 1A1, and forkhead box protein O3, which are all known to be involved in the regulation of apoptosis, fibrosis, and hypertrophy in cardiac cells while being targets for the above microRNAs. ACE inhibitor treatment increased expression of microRNA-133 and microRNA-1. The inhibitory action of ACE inhibitor treatment on increased cardiac NADPH oxidase isoform 1 expression after subtotal nephrectomy surgery suggests that inhibition of oxidative stress is also one of mechanism of ACE inhibitor-mediated cardioprotection. These finding suggests the involvement of microRNAs in the cardioprotective action of ACE inhibition in acute renal injury, which is mediated through an inhibitory action on profibrotic and proapoptotic target genes and stimulatory action on antihypertrophic and antiapoptotic target genes.", 
    "712": "The activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK-1) is a type I cell-surface receptor for the transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) family of proteins. Hypertension is related to TGF-\u03b21, because increased TGF-\u03b21 expression is correlated with an elevation in arterial pressure (AP) and TGF-\u03b2 expression is upregulated by the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. The purpose of this study was to assess the role of ALK-1 in regulation of AP using Alk1 haploinsufficient mice (Alk1(+/-)). We observed that systolic and diastolic AP were significantly higher in Alk1(+/-) than in Alk1(+/+) mice, and all functional and structural cardiac parameters (echocardiography and electrocardiography) were similar in both groups. Alk1(+/-) mice showed alterations in the circadian rhythm of AP, with higher AP than Alk1(+/+) mice during most of the light period. Higher AP in Alk1(+/-) mice is not a result of a reduction in the NO-dependent vasodilator response or of overactivation of the peripheral renin-angiotensin system. However, intracerebroventricular administration of losartan had a hypotensive effect in Alk1(+/-) and not in Alk1(+/+) mice. Alk1(+/-) mice showed a greater hypotensive response to the \u03b2-adrenergic antagonist atenolol and higher concentrations of epinephrine and norepinephrine in plasma than Alk1(+/+) mice. The number of brain cholinergic neurons in the anterior basal forebrain was reduced in Alk1(+/-) mice. Thus, we concluded that the ALK-1 receptor is involved in the control of AP, and the high AP of Alk1(+/-) mice is explained mainly by the sympathetic overactivation shown by these animals, which is probably related to the decreased number of cholinergic neurons.", 
    "713": "The objective of this study was to identify the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory peptides released from thermally treated Phaseolus vulgaris (pinto) whole beans after in vitro gastrointestinal digestion. The degree of hydrolysis increased during digestion reaching a value of 50% at the end of the pancreatic digestion. The\u2009<3 kDa fraction of the postpancreatic sample showed high ACE-inhibitory activity (IC50\u2009=\u2009105.6\u2009\u00b1\u20092.1 \u03bcg of peptides/mL). Peptides responsible for the ACE-inhibitory activity were isolated by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Three fractions, showing the highest inhibitory activity, were selected for tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) experiments. Eleven of the identified sequences have previously been described as ACE-inhibitors. Most of the identified bioactive peptides have a hydrophobic amino acid, (iso)leucine or phenylalanine, or proline at the C-terminal position, which is crucial for their ACE-inhibitory activity. The sequence of some peptides allowed us to anticipate the presence of ACE-inhibitory activity.", 
    "714": "Oxidative stress and inflammation are involved in the development and progression of diabetes and its complications. The renin-angiotensin system also plays an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetes and its complications. We hypothesized that curcumin and captopril would restore the kidney and nerve functions of diabetic rats through their angiotensin converting enzyme 1 (ACE1) inhibiting activity as well as their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Diabetes was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (100 mg\u00b7kg(-1) body weight). One week after induction of diabetes, rats were treated with 100 mg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7day(-1) curcumin or 50 mg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7day(-1) captopril orally for 6 weeks. Compared with diabetic control rats, curcumin- or captopril-treated diabetic rats had significantly improved blood glucose, lipid profile, kidney/body weight ratio, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and pain thresholds assessed by Von Frey filaments, hot plate test, and tail-flick test. Diabetic control rats showed increased levels of total peroxide, renal and neural tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and interleukin-10, and renal ACE1 compared with nondiabetic rats. Although treatment with either curcumin or captopril restored the altered variables, captopril was more effective in reducing these variables. ACE1 was positively correlated with BUN and creatinine and negatively correlated with paw withdrawal threshold, hot plate reaction time, and tail-flick latency, suggesting a possible causal relationship. We conclude that curcumin and captopril protect against diabetic nephropathy and neuropathy by inhibiting ACE1 as well as oxidation and inflammation. These findings suggest that curcumin and captopril may have a role in the treatment of diabetic nephropathy and neuropathy.",

Twenty-two (16 %) patients (seven Hybrid, 15 Norwood) with two consecutive echocardiograms reporting at least moderate dysfunction were included and compared to case-matched controls. Eleven of the 22 patients with dysfunction (50 %) underwent stage II, seven (32 %) were transplanted, and four (18 %) died prior to stage II. Of the patients who survived to hospital discharge (n = 17) following stage 1, 14 (82 %) required readmission for heart failure (HF) compared to only two (10 %) for controls (p < 0.001). Among patients with ventricular dysfunction, there was an increased use of ACE inhibitors or beta-blockers (82 vs. 25 %; p = 0.001), inotropes (71 vs. 15 %; p = 0.001), ventilation (58 vs. 10 %; p = 0.001), and ECMO (29 vs. 0 %; p = 0.014) for HF management post-discharge when compared to controls. There was a lower heart transplant-free survival at 7 months in patients with dysfunction compared to controls (50.6 vs. 90.9 %; p = 0.040). ECMO support (p = 0.001) and duration of inotropic support (p = 0.04) were significantly associated with death or transplantation before stage II palliation. Patients with ventricular dysfunction received more HF management and related admissions.

Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups, control, iso [100\u00a0mg/kg body weight was injected subcutaneously into rats at an interval of 24\u00a0h for 2\u00a0days (6th and 7th day) to induce MI] and pretreated animals with clopidogrel (0.2\u00a0mg/kg) and eugenol (50\u00a0mg/kg) orally for 7\u00a0days and intoxicated with isoproterenol (Iso\u00a0+\u00a0Clop) and (Iso\u00a0+\u00a0EG) groups. Isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarcted rats showed notable changes in the ECG pattern, increase in heart weight index, deterioration in the hemodynamic function and rise in plasma level of troponin-T, CK-MB and LDH and ALT by 316, 74, 172 and 45\u00a0%, respectively, with histological myocardium necrosis and cells inflammatory infiltration. In addition, significant increases in plasma levels of inflammatory biomarkers such as fibrinogen, \u03b11, \u03b12, \u03b21, \u03b22 and \u03b3 globulins with decrease level of albumin were observed in infarcted rats as compared to normal ones.

However, the administration of eugenol induced a clear improvement in cardiac biomarkers injury, reduced inflammatory mediators proteins, increased heart activities of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase with reduce in thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances content and inhibition of ventricular remodeling process through inhibition of ACE activity. Overall, eugenol evidences high preventive effects from cardiac remodeling process.", 
    "730": "A panel of internists and nephrologists developed this practical approach for the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative to guide assessment and care of chronic kidney disease (CKD) by primary care clinicians. Chronic kidney disease is defined as a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) and/or markers of kidney damage for at least 3 months. In clinical practice the most common tests for CKD include GFR estimated from the serum creatinine concentration (eGFR) and albuminuria from the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio. Assessment of eGFR and albuminuria should be performed for persons with diabetes and/or hypertension but is not recommended for the general population. Management of CKD includes reducing the patient's risk of CKD progression and risk of associated complications, such as acute kidney injury and cardiovascular disease, anemia, and metabolic acidosis, as well as mineral and bone disorder. Prevention of CKD progression requires blood pressure <140/90 mm Hg, use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers for patients with albuminuria and hypertension, hemoglobin A1c \u22647% for patients with diabetes, and correction of CKD-associated metabolic acidosis. To reduce patient safety hazards from medications, the level of eGFR should be considered when prescribing, and nephrotoxins should be avoided, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The main reasons to refer to nephrology specialists are eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m(2), severe albuminuria, and acute kidney injury. The ultimate goal of CKD management is to prevent disease progression, minimize complications, and promote quality of life.", 
    "731": "Activation of the intrarenal renin angiotensin system (RAS) is believed to play an important role in the development of hypertension and cystogenesis in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Results of clinical studies testing RAS inhibitors in slowing the progression of cystic disease in ADPKD are inconclusive, and we hypothesized that current RAS inhibitors do not adequately suppress intrarenal RAS. For this study, we compared a novel Gen 2 antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) that inhibits angiotensinogen (Agt) synthesis to lisinopril in adult conditional Pkd1 systemic-knockout mice, a model of ADPKD. Six weeks after Pkd1 global gene knockout, the mice were treated with Agt-ASO (66 mg/kg/wk), lisinopril (100 mg/kg/d), PBS (control), or scrambled ASO (66 mg/kg/wk) for 10 wk, followed by tissue collection. Agt ASO resulted in significant reduction in plasma, liver, and kidney Agt, and increased kidney renin compared with control treatments. Kidneys from Agt-ASO-treated mice were not as enlarged and showed reduced cystic volume compared with lisinopril or control treatments. Blood pressure was better controlled with lisinopril than with Agt-ASO. Agt-ASO suppressed cell proliferation in both cystic and noncystic cells compared with lisinopril and control treatments. However, Agt-ASO did not reduce cell proliferation in liver, which indicates that Agt-ASO targets cell signaling pathways that specifically suppresses cystogenesis in the kidney. These data suggest that Agt-ASO effectively attenuates intrarenal RAS and therefore can be a novel and effective agent for treating ADPKD.",

This could potentially improve adherence for those patients currently taking many separate tablets and also allow ready tailoring of a particular drug combination/drug release for the needs of an individual. The polypill here represents a cardiovascular treatment regime with the incorporation of an immediate release compartment with aspirin and hydrochlorothiazide and three sustained release compartments containing pravastatin, atenolol, and ramipril. X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) and Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) were used to assess drug-excipient interaction.

When the effects of drug treatment on survival were analysed, significantly increased survival was observed in patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors while diuretic and glucocorticosteroid use was associated with decreased survival. Among the evaluated groups of patients with CVD and advanced malignancy after radio- and/or chemotherapy, the highest probability of surviving a year in a relatively good general clinical condition was noted in patients with stage 3 breast cancer without cachexia, ischaemic heart disease and persistent somatic symptoms who were treated with tamoxifen, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and megestrol acetate.",

Patients in the LDL-A group had a lower incidence of maintenance dialysis (2/25 (8%) vs. 8/24 (33%), P\u2009<\u20090.05), and a trend towards lower mortality (2/25 (8%) vs. 7/24 (29%), P\u2009=\u20090.074). These results suggest that LDL-A decreases the risk of maintenance dialysis in severe renal CCE patients after vascular interventions.", 
    "761": "CD34(+) stem/progenitor cells have been identified as a promising cell population for the autologous cell-based therapies in patients with cardiovascular disease. The counter-regulatory axes of renin angiotensin system, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)/Ang II/angiotensin type 1 (AT1) receptor and ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas receptor, play an important role in the cardiovascular repair. This study evaluated the expression and vascular repair-relevant functions of these two pathways in human CD34(+) cells. CD34(+) cells were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (MNCs), obtained from healthy volunteers. Expression of ACE, ACE2, AT1, and angiotensin type 2 and Mas receptors were determined. Effects of Ang II, Ang-(1-7), Norleu(3)-Ang-(1-7), and ACE2 activators, xanthenone (XNT) and diminazene aceturate (DIZE) on proliferation, migration, and adhesion of CD34(+) cells were evaluated. ACE2 and Mas were relatively highly expressed in CD34(+) cells compared with MNCs. Ang-(1-7) or its analog, Norleu(3)-Ang-(1-7), stimulated proliferation of CD34(+) cells that was associated with decrease in phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 levels and was inhibited by triciribin, an AKT inhibitor. Migration of CD34(+) cells was enhanced by Ang-(1-7) or Norleu(3)-Ang-(1-7) that was decreased by a Rho-kinase inhibitor, Y-27632. In the presence of Ang II, XNT or DIZE enhanced proliferation and migration that were blocked by DX-600, an ACE2 inhibitor. Treatment of MNCs with Ang II, before the isolation of CD34(+) cells, attenuated the proliferation and migration to stromal derived factor-1\u03b1. This attenuation was reversed by apocynin, an NADPH oxidase inhibitor. Adhesion of MNCs or CD34(+) cells to fibronectin was enhanced by Ang II and was unaffected by Ang-(1-7). This study suggests that ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas pathway stimulates functions of CD34(+) cells that are cardiovascular protective, whereas Ang II attenuates these functions by acting on MNCs. These findings imply that activation of ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis is a promising approach for enhancing reparative outcomes of cell-based therapies.",

    "766": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is a zinc-dependent dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase with an essential role in blood pressure homeostasis in mammals. ACE has long been targeted in the treatment of hypertension through ACE inhibitors, however current inhibitors are known to cause severe side effects. Therefore, there is a requirement for a new generation of ACE inhibitors and structural information will be invaluable in their development. ACE is a challenging enzyme to work with due to its extensive glycosylation. As such, the Drosophila melanogaster ACE homologue, AnCE, which shares \u223c60% sequence similarity with human ACE, can be used as a model for studying inhibitor binding. The presence of ligands originating from the crystallisation condition at the AnCE active site has proved an obstacle to studying the binding of new inhibitor precursors. Here we present the crystal structure of AnCE (in a new crystal form) at 1.85\u00a0\u00c5 resolution, using crystals grown under different conditions. This new structure may be more suitable for studying the binding of new compounds, with the potential of developing a new generation of improved ACE inhibitors.",

    "771": "ACE inhibitors and ARBs (angiotensin receptor blockers) have been shown to attenuate radiation injuries in animal models of lethal gamma irradiation. These two classes of drug act by curtailing the actions of angiotensin II-linked inflammatory pathways that are up-regulated during gamma radiation in organ systems such as the brain, lung, kidney, and bone marrow. ACE inhibitors inhibit ACE and attenuate the formation of angiotensin II from angiotensin I; ARBs block the angiotensin AT1 receptor and attenuate the actions of angiotensin II that are elicited through the receptor. DAA-I (des-aspartate-angiotensin I), an orally active angiotensin peptide, also attenuates the deleterious actions of angiotensin II. It acts as an agonist on the angiotensin AT1 receptor and elicits responses that oppose those of angiotensn II. Thus, DAA-I was investigated for its anticipated radioprotection in gamma irradiated mice. DAA-I administered orally at 800 nmole/kg/day for 30 days post exposure (6.4 Gy) attenuated the death of mice during the 30-day period. The attenuation was blocked by losartan (50 nmole/kg/day, i.p.) that was administered sequential to DAA-I administration. This shows that the radioprotection was mediated via the angiotensin AT1 receptor. Furthermore, the radioprotection correlated to an increase in circulating PGE2 of surviving animals, and this suggests that PGE2 is involved in the radioprotection in DAA-I-treated mice. At the hematopoietic level, DAA-I significantly improved two syndromes of myelosuppression (leucopenia and lymphocytopenia), and mice pre-treated with DAA-I prior to gamma irradiation showed significant improvement in the four myelodysplastic syndromes that were investigated, namely leucopenia, lymphocytopenia, monocytopenia and thrombocytopenia. Based on the known ability of PGE2 to attenuate the loss of functional hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in radiation injury, we hypothesize that PGE2 mediated the action of DAA-I. DAA-I completely attenuated the increase in circulating level of two inflammatory cytokines, TNF\u03b1 and IL-6, in irradiated mice; and this shows that DAA-I exerted additional anti-inflammatory actions, which could also have contributed to its radioprotection. These findings show that DAA-I acts via a novel mechanism of action on the angiotensin AT1 receptor to specifically release PGE2, which mediates radioprotection in the gamma irradiated mice.", 
    "772": "The aim of this work was to produce antihypertensive protein hydrolysates through different forms of enzymatic hydrolysis (2% pepsin, 4% pepsin, 1% alcalase, 2% alcalase, 2% papain, and 2% pepsin + pancreatin) of hemp seed proteins (HSP). The hemp seed protein hydrolysates (HPHs) were tested for in vitro inhibitions of renin and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), two of the enzymes that regulate human blood pressure. The HPHs were then administered orally (200 mg/kg body weight) to spontaneously hypertensive rats and systolic blood pressure (SBP)-lowering effects measured over a 24 h period. Size exclusion chromatography mainly showed a 300-9560 Da peptide size range for the HPHs, while amino acid composition data had the 2% pepsin HPH with the highest cysteine content. Fluorescence spectroscopy revealed higher fluorescence intensities for the peptides when compared to the unhydrolyzed hemp seed protein. Overall, the 1% alcalase HPH was the most effective (p < 0.05) SBP-reducing agent (-32.5 \u00b1 0.7 mmHg after 4 h), while the pepsin HPHs produced longer-lasting effects (-23.0 \u00b1 1.4 mmHg after 24 h). We conclude that an optimized combination of the fast-acting HPH (1% alcalase) with the longer-lasting HPHs (2% and 4% pepsin) could provide daily effective SBP reductions.",

Key studies for this year include advice on symptomatic management and prognosis for acute respiratory infections; a novel and effective strengthening treatment for plantar fasciitis; a study showing that varenicline plus nicotine replacement is more effective than varenicline alone; a network meta-analysis concluding that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are preferred over angiotensin II receptor blockers; the clear benefits of initial therapy with metformin over other agents in patients with diabetes mellitus; and important guidance on the use of anticoagulants.", 
    "778": "Transient angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition induces persistent changes that protect against future nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor-induced cardiac fibrosis and inflammation. Given the role of fibroblasts in mediating these effects, the present study investigates whether prior ACE inhibition produced persistent changes in cardiac fibroblast physiology. Adult male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) were treated with vehicle (C+L) or the ACE inhibitor, enalapril (E+L) for 2 wk followed by a 2-wk washout period and a subsequent 7-day challenge with the NOS inhibitor N(\u03c9)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester. A third set of untreated SHRs served as controls. At the end of the study period, cardiac fibroblasts were isolated from control, C+L, and E+L left ventricles to assess proliferation rate, collagen expression, and chemokine release in vitro. After 7 days of NOS inhibition, there were areas of myocardial injury but no significant change in collagen deposition in E+L and C+L hearts in vivo. In vitro, cardiac fibroblasts isolated from C+L but not E+L hearts were hyperproliferative, demonstrated increased collagen type I gene expression, and an elevated secretion of the macrophage-recruiting chemokines monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor. These findings demonstrate that in vivo N(\u03c9)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester treatment produces phenotypic changes in fibroblasts that persist in vitro. Moreover, this is the first demonstration that transient ACE inhibition can produce a persistent modification of the cardiac fibroblast phenotype to one that is less inflammatory and fibrogenic. It may be that the cardioprotective effects of ACE inhibition are related in part to beneficial changes in cardiac fibroblast physiology.",

There are few studies of the association between genetic polymorphisms and the risks of aspirin-induced ulcer or its complications. Individuals with two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), A-842G and C50T, exhibit increased sensitivity to aspirin and lower prostaglandin synthesis capacity but the polymorphism lacked statistical significance in relation to an association with bleeding peptic ulcer. In our previous Japanese study, SLCO1B1 521TT genotype and the SLCO1B1 *1b haplotype were significantly associated with the risk of peptic ulcer and ulcer bleeding in patients taking LDA, especially in the patients with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), angiotensin type 1 receptor blocker (ARB), or statin co-treatment. Protonpump inhibitors (PPIs) are recommended for patients who require antiplatelet therapy and have a history of upper GI bleeding. The interaction between PPIs and consequent impaired effectiveness of clopidogrel has caused concern regarding the effect of genetic polymorphisms of the CYP2C19 which mediates conversion of clopidogrel to its active metabolite. The later recent genome-wide analysis of SNPs indicated the association of several SNPs with small bowel bleeding in Japanese patients taking LDA. The data are still lacking and further prospective studies are needed to identify the specific gene polymorphisms as risk or protective factors for GI bleeding associated with LDA.",

In the past those risk factors were typically seen only in the elderly. On long-term, the elevated body-mass-index is a very important risk factor for primary arterial hypertension in children and adolescents, because it is responsible for both structural and functional changes in the cardiovascular system. Regular screening for these target organ damages is necessary. However, the role of newer methods has still to be proven in current research. The primary therapeutical options for this group are life style interventions like body weight control and physical activity. Children and adolescents with arterial hypertension persisting despite life style interventions should receive medication early, in order to prevent persistent target organ damage. Drug therapy should start as mono therapy--depending on patient profile--with one ACE inhibitor, angiotensin II receptor antagonist, calcium channel blocker or beta-blocker. If blood pressure cannot be reduced into the target area by mono therapy, combination therapy with different mechanisms should be started. Forms of secondary arterial hypertension have to be treated according to the primary disease.",

In this study, we investigated the chemical composition of Fresco-style cheese wheys and their potential as a source of protein fractions with antioxidant and angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activities. Three samples from Fresco, Panela, and Ranchero cheeses whey were physicochemically characterized. Water-soluble extracts were fractionated to obtain whey fractions with different molecular weights: 10-5, 5-3, 3-1 and <1 kDa. The results indicated differences in the lactose, protein, ash, and dry matter contents (% wt/wt) in the different Fresco-style cheese wheys. All whey fractions had antioxidant and ACE-inhibitory activities. The 10-5 kDa whey fraction of Ranchero cheese had the highest Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (0.62 \u00b1 0.00 mM), and the 3-1 kDa Panela and Fresco cheese whey fractions showed the highest ACE-inhibitory activity (0.57 \u00b1 0.02 and 0.59 \u00b1 0.04 \u03bcg/mL 50%-inhibitory concentration values, respectively).

Only VPP, IPP, LHLPLP, and HLPLP were revealed in the WSE, and their total amount was in the range of 8.46 to 21.55 mg/kg of cheese. Following in vitro static gastrointestinal digestion, the same ACE-I peptides along with the newly formed AYFYPEL and AYFYPE were found in the 3 kDa WSE of PR digestates.

On average, 0.6% of LHLPLP initially present in the digestates added to the apical compartment were transported intact to the basolateral chamber after the same incubation time. Higher transport rate (2.9%) was ascertained for the peptide HLPLP. No other intact ACE-I peptides were revealed in the basolateral compartment. For the first time, these results demonstrated that the ACE-I peptides HLPLP and LHLPLP present in the in vitro digestates of PR cheese are partially absorbed through an in vitro model of human intestinal epithelium.",

This study was performed to evaluate cardiopulmonary damages and inflammatory response on injected rats with Aah I toxin of scorpion venom and the involvement of Kallikrein-Kinin system in this pathogenesis. Obtained results revealed that Aah I toxin induces inflammatory cell infiltration accompanied by cellular peroxidase activities, a release of cytokine levels, pulmonary and myocardial damage, with altered metabolic activities and imbalanced redox status. Administration of aprotinin (bradykinin inhibitor) and especially icatibant (bradykinin \u03b22 receptor antagonist) seemed to be able to protect animals against the toxicity of Aah I; nevertheless, the use of captopril (kininase II inhibitor) reduced partially some cardiac disorders. These findings indicate that the kallikrein-kinin system may contribute to the physiopathological effect and lung edema formation induced by toxin, which suggests a potential use of drugs with significant anti-kinin properties.",

Evidence from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) rarely goes beyond a few years of follow-up, but patients are often given continuous treatment with multiple drugs well into old age. We focus on 4 commonly used cardiovascular drug classes: aspirin, statins, beta-blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors given to patients after myocardial infarction. However, the issues raised apply more broadly to all long-term medications across cardiovascular diseases and the whole of medicine. The evidence and limitations of RCTs are addressed, as well as current practice in pre-licensing trials, the increasing problems of polypharmacy (especially in the elderly), the lack of trial evidence for withdrawal of drugs, the role of regulatory authorities and other stakeholders in this challenging situation, and the potential educational solutions for the medical profession. We conclude with a set of recommendations on how to improve the situation of long-term drug use.",

Similarly, the Black-ACE group had higher rates of AMI (0.46% vs. 0.26%; p = 0.04), stroke (2.43% vs. 1.93%; p = 0.05), and congestive heart failure (3.75% vs. 2.25%; p < 0.0001) than the Black-NoACE group.

    "809": "Mechanical ventilation is a life-saving intervention for patients in respiratory failure. Unfortunately, prolonged ventilator support results in diaphragmatic atrophy and contractile dysfunction leading to diaphragm weakness, which is predicted to contribute to problems in weaning patients from the ventilator. While it is established that ventilator-induced oxidative stress is required for the development of ventilator-induced diaphragm weakness, the signaling pathway(s) that trigger oxidant production remain unknown. However, recent evidence reveals that increased plasma levels of angiotensin II (ANG II) result in oxidative stress and atrophy in limb skeletal muscles. Using a well-established animal model of mechanical ventilation, we tested the hypothesis that increased circulating levels of ANG II are required for both ventilator-induced diaphragmatic oxidative stress and diaphragm weakness. Cause and effect was determined by administering an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril) to prevent ventilator-induced increases in plasma ANG II levels, and the ANG II type 1 receptor antagonist (losartan) was provided to prevent the activation of ANG II type 1 receptors. Enalapril prevented the increase in plasma ANG II levels but did not protect against ventilator-induced diaphragmatic oxidative stress or diaphragm weakness. In contrast, losartan attenuated both ventilator-induced oxidative stress and diaphragm weakness. These findings indicate that circulating ANG II is not essential for the development of ventilator-induced diaphragm weakness but that activation of ANG II type 1 receptors appears to be a requirement for ventilator-induced diaphragm weakness. Importantly, these experiments provide the first evidence that the Food and Drug Administration-approved drug losartan may have clinical benefits to protect against ventilator-induced diaphragm weakness in humans.",

The policy was intended to save costs without affecting patient outcomes. However, little is known about the actual impact of the BCBV indicator on ACEIs/ARBs utilisation and cost-savings. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the impact of BCBV policy on ACEIs/ARBs utilisation and cost-savings, including exploration of regional variations of the policy's impact.",

Instantly after its initiation, the policy was associated with a sudden reduction in the proportion of ACEIs prescription; however, it resulted in a statistically significant increase in the post-policy monthly trend of ACEIs prescription proportion of 0.013% (p\u2009<\u20090.001), resulting in an overall post-policy slope of -0.007%. Despite this post-policy induced increment, the policy failed to achieve the 80% target, which resulted in missing a potential cost-saving opportunity.

In the present study, we investigated the importance of the facilitatory mechanisms of the CeA on NaCl and water intake produced by the deactivation of LPBN inhibitory mechanisms. Male Holtzman rats (n=7-14) with stainless steel cannulas implanted bilaterally in the CeA and LPBN were used. Bilateral injections of moxonidine (\u03b12-adrenoceptor/imidazoline agonist, 0.5 nmol/0.2 \u03bcl) into the LPBN increased furosemide+captopril-induced 0.3M NaCl (29.7 \u00b1 7.2, vs. vehicle: 4.4 \u00b1 1.6 ml/2h) and water intake (26.4 \u00b1 6.7, vs. vehicle: 8.2 \u00b1 1.6 ml/2h). The GABAA agonist muscimol (0.25 nmol/0.2 \u03bcl) injected bilaterally into the CeA abolished the effects of moxonidine into the LPBN on 0.3M NaCl (2.8 \u00b1 1.6 ml/2h) and water intake (3.3 \u00b1 2.3 ml/2h). Euhydrated rats treated with muscimol (0.5 nmol/0.2 \u03bcl) into the LPBN also ingested 0.3M NaCl (19.1 \u00b1 6.4 ml/4h) and water (8.8 \u00b1 3.2 ml/4h). Muscimol (0.5 nmol/0.2 \u03bcl) into the CeA also abolished 0.3M NaCl (0.1 \u00b1 0.04 ml/4h) and water intake (0.1 \u00b1 0.02 ml/4h) in euhydrated treated with muscimol into the LPBN.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the association between usage of different antihypertensive drugs and the development of NOD in female patients with hypertension and CAD.Data in this retrospective cohort study were obtained from claim forms submitted to the Taiwan Bureau of National Health Insurance in central Taiwan during the period 2006-2011. We estimated the odds ratios (OR) to approximate the relative risk of NOD development associated with antihypertensive drug use.Of the 20,108 female patients with CAD at baseline, 2288 patients developed NOD during the 6-year follow-up. Subjects treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (OR, 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.84-1.00), angiotensin receptor blockers (OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.82-0.99), and alpha-blockers (OR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.79-0.98) in the adjusted analyses had greater reductions of the risk than among nonusers.

Vasodilators were not associated with risk of NOD.We conclude that women with hypertension who take ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and alpha-blockers are at lower risk of NOD and that use of diuretics, beta-blockers, and calcium channel blockers was associated with a significantly increased risk of developing NOD during the 6-year follow-up.", 
    "820": "Oligopeptide transporters serve important functions in nutrition and pharmacology. In particular, these transporters help maintain the homeostasis of peptides. The peptide-transporter PEPT2 is a high-affinity and low-capacity type oligopeptide transporter from the proton-coupled oligopeptide transporter family. PEPT2 has recently received attention because of its potential application in targeted drug delivery. PEPT2 is widely distributed in kidney, central nervous system, and lung of organisms. In general, all dipeptides, tripeptides, and peptide-like drugs such as \u03b2-lactam antibiotics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors could be mediated and transported as a substrate of PEPT2. The design of many extant drugs and prodrugs is based on the substrate structure of PEPT2 to accelerate absorption via peptide transporters. Thus, this paper summarizes the substrate features of PEPT2 to promote the rational design of drugs and prodrugs that target peptide transporters.", 
    "821": "Vasoactive agents are used in critical care to optimize circulatory function, but their effects on renal tissue oxygenation in the absence of anesthesia remain largely unknown. Therefore, we assessed the effects of multiple vasoactive agents on regional kidney oxygenation in awake sheep. Sheep were surgically instrumented with pulmonary and renal artery flow probes, and combination fiber-optic probes, in the renal cortex and medulla, comprising a fluorescence optode to measure tissue Po2 and a laser-Doppler probe to assess tissue perfusion. Carotid arterial and renal venous cannulas enabled measurement of arterial pressure and total renal oxygen delivery and consumption. Norepinephrine (0.1 or 0.8 \u03bcg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7min(-1)) dose-dependently reduced cortical and medullary laser Doppler flux (LDF) and Po2 without significantly altering renal blood flow (RBF), or renal oxygen delivery or consumption. Angiotensin II (9.8 \u00b1 2.1 \u03bcg/h) reduced RBF by 21%, renal oxygen delivery by 28%, oxygen consumption by 18%, and medullary Po2 by 38%, but did not significantly alter cortical Po2 or cortical or medullary LDF. Arginine vasopressin (3.3 \u00b1 0.5 \u03bcg/h) caused similar decreases in RBF and renal oxygen delivery, but did not significantly alter renal oxygen consumption or cortical or medullary LDF or Po2. Captopril had no observable effects on cortical or medullary LDF or Po2, at a dose that increased renal oxygen delivery by 24%, but did not significantly alter renal oxygen consumption. We conclude that vasoactive agents have diverse effects on regional kidney oxygenation in awake sheep that are not predictable from their effects on LDF, RBF, or total renal oxygen delivery and consumption.",

A skin biopsy showed IgA deposits on superficial dermal capillaries and IgA vasculitis (IgAV) (former Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein purpura) was assumed. The patient was treated with colchicine, deflazacort and azathioprine, but as a regression in the purpuric lesions was noted, a decline in renal function was detected. A kidney biopsy revealed mesangial proliferation with IgA deposition and IgAV nephritis was considered. Immunosuppressive treatment was adjusted, with progressive normalisation of renal function and disappearance of proteinuria over a monthly follow-up; after 6\u2005months, total remission was achieved.

Ac-SDKP is an alternative substrate for angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). There are several indications that Ac-SDKP may be protective in the cardiovascular system. First, the level of Ac- SDKP in plasma and tissues is reduced in some cardiovascular pathologies such as hypertension. Second, an administration of Ac-SDKP to rodents attenuates inflammation, cell differentiation, proliferation, and migration resulting in a reduction of fibrosis in the heart, vessels and kidneys in conditions of their disorders. Third, the treatment with ACE-inhibitors is associated with a reduced degradation and hence increased levels of Ac-SDKP, while a simultaneous treatment with monoclonal antibodies against Ac- SDKP partly counteracts the benefit of ACE-inhibition. Since Ac-SDKP fails to reduce blood pressure and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), its potential structural benefit is obviously mediated by direct action on tissue in preventing or reversing excessive fibrosis. The protection by ACE-inhibition seems to be partly mediated by increased availability of Ac-SDKP. Thus, it is to suppose that harvesting the knowledge on the role of Ac-SDKP in cardiovascular physiology and pathology could deepen our insight into the mechanisms of action of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) as well as agents interfering with this system. The exciting protective potential of Ac-SDKP suggests that this compound could be a focused drug target not only in animal experiments but also in the clinical cardio-pharmacologic research in the near future.",

Enalapril, an angiotensin II-converting enzyme inhibitor, is a drug prescribed to ameliorate this heart dysfunction, and appears to exert a potential role in immune system regulation. Our aim was to evaluate the chronic cardiac inflammatory parameters after therapeutic treatment with enalapril and benznidazole in C57BL/6 mice infected with the VL-10 strain of T. cruzi. After infection, animals were treated with oral doses of enalapril (25 mg/kg), benznidazole (100 mg/kg), or both during 30 days. Morphometric parameters and levels of chemokines (CCL2, CCL5), IL-10, creatine kinases (CKs), and C-reactive protein were evaluated in the heart and serum at the 120th day of infection. Enalapril alone or in combination with benznidazole did not change the number of circulating parasites, but reduced cardiac leukocyte recruitment and total collagen in the cardiac tissue. Interestingly, the combination therapy (enalapril/benznidazole) also reduced the levels of chemokines, CK and CK-MB, and C-reactive proteins in chronic phase. In conclusion, during the chronic experimental T. cruzi infection, the combination therapy using enalapril plus benznidazole potentiated their immunomodulatory effects, resulting in a low production of biomarkers of cardiac lesions.",

STZ produced hyperglycemia, weight loss, polydipsia, polyphagia, and polyuria as well as long-term arterial hypotension, bradycardia, and tactile allodynia at 10-12 weeks. Daily administration of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, fosinopril (25 mg/kg, p.o., for 11 weeks) partially reduced the loss of body weight, decreased hyperglycemia, and systolic blood pressure in diabetic rats. Likewise, systemic administration of fosinopril prevented the development and maintenance of tactile allodynia in STZ-induced diabetic rats.

The hydrolysate was fractionated by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), and the inhibitory activities of the resulting fractions were evaluated using ACE inhibitory assay. Two novel ACE inhibitory peptides (VY-7 and VG-8) were identified using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and database-assisted peptide sequencing. VY-7 and VG-8 were derived from momordin A and MAP30, respectively, and their IC50 values were as low as 8.64\u00b10.60 and 13.30\u00b10.62 \u03bcM, respectively. Lineweaver-Burk plots further indicated that VY-7, which showed the best IC50 value, acts as a competitive inhibitor. Notably, the content of VY-7 in crude thermolysin digest was determined to be as high as 14.89\u00b10.88 \u03bcg/mg using LC-MS/MS quantification. In the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) model, oral administration of VY-7 at 2mg/kg body weight significantly decreased the systolic blood pressure.

In this study, we comprehensively identified peptides derived from bitter melon (Momordica charantia) seed proteins (BMSPs) using a shotgun proteomics approach. Based on results from an in vitro ACE inhibitory assay, two peptides (VY-7 and VG-8) derived from momordin A and MAP30 proteins, respectively, showed good ACE inhibitory activities. For VY-7, which showed the best IC50 value (8.64\u00b10.60 \u03bcM), the inhibition type was determined to be competitive inhibition, as found using a Lineweaver-Burk plot.

Recently, a once-daily, orally-administered, fixed-dose combination (FDC) of perindopril arginine plus amlodipine besylate (Prestalia(\u00ae); hereafter referred to as perindopril/amlodipine FDC) was approved in the USA for the treatment of hypertension. This article reviews the efficacy and tolerability of perindopril/amlodipine FDC and briefly summarizes the agent's pharmacologic properties. As demonstrated in short-term randomized controlled trials, perindopril/amlodipine FDC was significantly more effective in reducing blood pressure (BP) than monotherapy with either of the component drugs, and it appeared to be more effective than an up-titration scheme using valsartan and valsartan/amlodipine. The FDC agent was generally well tolerated, with the most common adverse events (peripheral edema, cough, headache, and dizziness) being consistent with the well-defined tolerability profiles of the individual component drugs. Furthermore, perindopril/amlodipine FDC was associated with a numerically lower incidence of peripheral edema compared with amlodipine monotherapy. Thus, perindopril/amlodipine FDC represents a useful option for the treatment of hypertension, including as initial therapy for patients likely to require multiple drugs to achieve their BP targets.",

The disease is now the most common cause of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) in developed countries, and both the incidence and prevalence of diabetes mellitus is increasing worldwide. Current treatments are directed at controlling hyperglycemia and hypertension, as well as blockade of the renin angiotensin system with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), and angiotensin receptor blockers. Despite these therapies, DN progresses to ESKD in many patients. As a result, much interest is focused on developing new therapies. It has been over two decades since ACEIs were shown to have beneficial effects in DN independent of their blood pressure-lowering actions. Since that time, our understanding of disease mechanisms in DN has evolved. In this review, we summarize major cell signaling pathways implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic kidney disease, as well as emerging treatment strategies. The goal is to identify promising targets that might be translated into therapies for the treatment of patients with diabetic kidney disease.",

Posttransplantation proteinuria is associated with reduced graft survival as well as an increased risk of cardiovascular events and death. Treatments to decrease proteinuria have been based on blocking the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system with the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers.

The BJR was analysed by measuring bradycardic and hypotensive responses elicited by serotonin administration. Myocyte hypertrophy and matrix collagen deposition were determined by morphometric analysis of H&E and picrosirius red-stained samples, respectively. TNF-\u03b1 and ACEA were also studied. RT promoted physiological myocyte hyrpertrophy but did not cause changes in the other parameters. The association of ND with RT increased myocyte hypertrophy, deposition of matrix type I collagen, TNF-\u03b1 and ACEA; decreased IL-10, and impairment in the BJR were observed in ND+EXERC compared with CONT and EXERC. ND is associated with alterations in cardiac structure and function as a result of the development of pathological cardiac hypertrophy (cardiac cytokine imbalance, elevation of ACEA) and cardiac injury, even when combined with resistance training.",

Results revealed that RVPSL could be passively transported across Caco-2 cell monolayers. However, during the process of transport, 36.31% \u00b1 1.22% of the initial RVPSL added to the apical side was degraded, but this degradation decreased to 23.49% \u00b1 0.68% when the Caco-2 cell monolayers were preincubated with diprotin A (P < 0.001), suggesting that RVPSL had a low resistance to various brush border membrane peptidases. When transport from the apical side to the basolateral side was investigated, the apparent permeability coefficient (Papp) was (6.97 \u00b1 1.11) \u00d7 10(-6) cm/s. The transport route of RVPSL appears to be the paracellular pathway via tight junctions, as only cytochalasin D, a disruptor of tight junctions (TJs), significantly increased the transport rate (P < 0.001). In addition, the relationship between the structure of RVPSL and transport across Caco-2 cell monolayers was studied by mutation of RVPSL. It was found that N-terminal Pro residues were more beneficial for transport of pentapeptides across Caco-2 cell monolayers than Arg and Val. Furthermore, RVPSL could be more easily transported as smaller peptides, especially in the form of dipeptides and tripeptides.",

After a sting, most people show typical local symptoms, 5% to 15% develop local allergic reactions, and 3% to 8.9%--systemic allergic reactions (SARs), which may be potentially life-threatening in about 10% of them. In mild forms of Hymenoptera-venom allergy (HVA), the leading symptoms are urticaria and edema (grades I and II, respectively, according to the Mueller classification). Severe SARs are classified as grade III (respiratory symptoms) and IV (cardiovascular symptoms). Rare manifestations of HVA are Kounis syndrome and takotsubo cardiomyopathy. All patients after an SAR require standard (skin test, IgE, tryptase) or comprehensive (component diagnosis, basophil activation test) allergy testing. All patients with severe systemic symptoms (hypertension, disturbances in consciousness) should be tested for mastocytosis. Additionally, a relationship was found between the severity of HVA symptoms and intake of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs). There is a similar concern, although less well-documented, about the use of \u03b2-blockers. Patients with HVA who have experienced a SAR are potential candidates for venom immunotherapy (VIT), which is effective in 80% to 100% of individuals treated for 3 to 5 years. An increased risk of a VIT failure has been reported in patients with systemic mastocytosis and those treated with ACEIs. In certain groups (beekeepers, patients who develop a SAR to stings during a VIT with a standard dose, as well as those with a SAR to maintenance doses of VIT), a twice higher maintenance dose is recommended.

    "897": "Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease associated with cardiovascular dysfunction including myocardial infarction, unstable angina, sudden cardiac death, stroke and peripheral thromboses. It has been predicted that atherosclerosis will be the primary cause of death in the world by 2020. Atherogenesis is initiated by endothelial injury due to oxidative stress associated with cardiovascular risk factors including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cigarette smoking, dyslipidemia, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. The impairment of the endothelium associated with cardiovascular risk factors creates an imbalance between vasodilating and vasoconstricting factors, in particular, an increase in angiotensin II (Ang II) and a decrease in nitric oxide. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS), and its primary mediator Ang II, also have a direct influence on the progression of the atherosclerotic process via effects on endothelial function, inflammation, fibrinolytic balance, and plaque stability. Anti-inflammatory agents [statins, secretory phospholipase A2 inhibitor, lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 inhibitor, 5-lipoxygenase activating protein, chemokine motif ligand-2, C-C chemokine motif receptor 2 pathway inhibitors, methotrexate, IL-1 pathway inhibitor and RAS inhibitors (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors)], Ang II receptor blockers and ranin inhibitors may slow inflammatory processes and disease progression. Several studies in human using anti-inflammatory agents and RAS inhibitors revealed vascular benefits and reduced progression of coronary atherosclerosis in patients with stable angina pectoris; decreased vascular inflammatory markers, improved common carotid intima-media thickness and plaque volume in patients with diagnosed atherosclerosis.

We investigated potential anti-arrhythmic (AA) benefits in a mouse model of ischemic HF. We hypothesized that normalization of diastolic calcium (Ca(2+)) by ACE-I may prevent Ca(2+)-dependent reduction of inward rectifying K(+) current (IK1) and occurrence of arrhythmias after MI. Mice were randomly assigned to three groups: Sham, MI, and MI-D (6 weeks of treatment with ACE-I delapril started 24h after MI). Electrophysiological analyses showed that delapril attenuates MI-induced prolongations of electrocardiogram parameters (QRS complex, QT, QTc intervals) and conduction time from His bundle to ventricular activation. Delapril improved the sympatho-vagal balance (LF/HF) and reduced atrio-ventricular blocks and ventricular arrhythmia. Investigations in cardiomyocytes showed that delapril prevented the decrease of IK1 measured by patch-clamp technique. IK1 reduction was related to intracellular Ca(2+) overload. This reduction was not observed when intracellular free-Ca(2+) was maintained low. Conversely, increasing intracellular free-Ca(2+) in Sham following application of SERCA2a inhibitor thapsigargin reduced IK1. Thapsigargin had no effect in MI animals and abolished the benefits of delapril on IK1 in MI-D mice. Delapril prevented both the prolongation of action potential late repolarization and the depolarization of resting membrane potential, two phenomena known to trigger abnormal electrical activities, promoted by MI.

    "900": "Vascular injury, characterized by endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, structural remodeling, thrombosis and calcification leads to cardiovascular diseases. Angiotensin (Ang) II (1-8) - synthesized mainly by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is the best characterized mediator of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). This peptide initially identified by its vasoactive properties was found to play a major role in vascular response to insult. However, recent discovery of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) that produces vasoprotective Ang-(1-7) peptide highlighted complexity of the system and suggested that balance between ACE/Ang II and ACE2/Ang-(1-7) is fundamental in maintaining vascular homeostasis and its disorders are associated with cardiovascular pathology. There is therefore a need to develop methods for comprehensive analysis of biologically active Ang peptides and their metabolites of ACE/Ang II and ACE2/Ang-(1-7) axes. Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) is an analytical technique that offers potential for specific, simultaneous analysis of Ang peptides. With sensitivity added by application of preconcentration nanochromatography reaching picomolar concentrations, practically all Ang peptides identified so far could be quantified in biological samples. Ang profiling is important not only for understanding their physiological or pathological role but could also serve as an early diagnostic biomarker of endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular pathology. It could also be used for monitoring the efficacy of the RAS-targeted therapies. Although, the methodology requires further improvements to adopt it for routine application, Ang peptide profiling with targeted LC/MS analysis might assess functional balance between ACE/Ang II and ACE2/Ang-(1-7) axes, facilitate our understanding of the cardiovascular pathology and enhance biomarker portfolio in cardiovascular diseases.",

These findings sparked great excitement in the renal community, implying that abatacept, a costimulatory inhibitor that targets B7-1, could be a novel therapy for diabetic renal disease. Given previous concerns over the value of B7-1 immunostaining and the efficacy of abatacept in patients with recurrent FSGS after renal transplantation, we investigated B7-1 expression in human and experimental DN before embarking on clinical studies of the use of B7-1 targeting strategies to treat proteinuria in DN. Immunohistochemical analysis of kidney specimens using different antibodies revealed that B7-1 is not induced in podocytes of patients with DN, independent of disease stage, or BTBR ob/obmice, a model of type 2 diabetes. These results do not support the use of abatacept as a therapeutic strategy for targeting podocyte B7-1 for the prevention or treatment of DN.",

NAFLD is considered a hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome and is related to diabetes, insulin resistance, central obesity, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is an entity that describes liver inflammation due to NAFLD. Growing evidence suggests that NAFLD is a multisystem disease with a clinical burden that is not only confined to liver-related morbidity and mortality, but that also affects several extra-hepatic organs and regulatory pathways. Thus, NAFLD is considered an important public health issue, but there is currently no effective therapy for all NAFLD patients in the general population. Studies seeking optimal therapy for NAFLD and NASH have not yet led to development of a universal protocol for treating this growing problem. Several pharmacological agents have been studied in an effort to improve insulin resistance and the proinflammatory mediators that may be responsible for NASH progression. Cardiovascular risk factors are highly prevalent among NASH patients, and the backbone of treatment regimens for these patients still comprises general lifestyle interventions, including dietary changes and increased physical activity. Vitamin E and thiazolidinedione derivatives are currently the most evidence-based therapeutic options, but only limited clinical evidence is available regarding their long-term efficacy and safety.

The risk of infection is exacerbated in radiation combined skin-burn injury (RCI), which increase vulnerability. Furthermore, no suitable countermeasures for radiation combined skin-burn injury have been established. In this study, we evaluated captopril as a potential countermeasure to radiation combined skin-burn injury. Captopril is an FDA-approved angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor that was previously reported to stimulate hematopoietic recovery after exposure to ionizing radiation. Female B6D2F1/J mice were whole-body bilateral (60)Co gamma-photon irradiated (dose rate of 0.4 Gy/min) with 9.5 Gy (LD70/30 for RCI), followed by nonlethal dorsal skin-burn injury under anesthesia (approximately 15% total-body surface-area burn). Mice were provided with acidified drinking water with or without dissolved captopril (0.55 g/l) for 30 days immediately after injury and were administered topical gentamicin (0.1% cream; day 1-10) and oral levofloxacin (90-100 mg/kg; day 3-16). Surviving mice were euthanized on day 30 after analyses of water consumption, body weight and survival. Our data demonstrate that, while treatment with captopril did mitigate mortality induced by radiation injury (RI) alone (55% captopril vs. 80% vehicle; n = 20, P < 0.05), it also resulted in decreased survival after radiation combined skin-burn injury (22% captopril vs. 41% vehicle; n = 22, P < 0.05). Moreover, captopril administration via drinking water produced an uneven dosage pattern among the different injury groups ranging from 74 \u00b1 5.4 to 115 \u00b1 2.2 mg/kg/day. Captopril treatment also did not counteract the negative alterations in hematology, splenocytes or bone marrow cellularity after either radiation injury or radiation combined skin-burn injury. These data suggest that captopril may exert its actions differently between the two injury models (RI vs. RCI) and that captopril dosing, when combined with topical and systemic antibiotic treatments, may not be a suitable countermeasure for RCI.",

The 2013 guidelines of the European Societies of Hypertension and Cardiology (ESH/ESC) provide a clear action plan for evidence-based diagnostics and therapeutic measures in hypertensive subjects and simplify target blood pressures across various patient groups. Non-pharmacological options play a central role in the treatment of arterial hypertension. The indications for drug therapy arise from three criteria including the level of hypertension, risk profile of the patient, as well as response to non-pharmacological therapy. For the first choice monotherapy five substance groups are available: diuretics, beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin (AT) 1 receptor antagonists and calcium antagonists. By combination therapy, the responder rate can be significantly increased with respect to a normalization of blood pressure. A true treatment resistance, in which the therapeutic goal is not reached in spite of a triple combination with maximum dosage, is extremely rare.

Special emphasis was made not to use these combinations in patients with diabetic nephropathy. The door was left open to therapy individualization, especially for patients with heart failure, when the combined use of an ARB and ACEI is considered absolutely essential, although renal function, electrolytes and blood pressure should be closely monitored.

In this study we sought to determine the efficacy of combining these three treatments on vascular and neural complications in a high fat fed low dose streptozotocin treated rat, a model of type 2 diabetes. Rats were fed a high fat diet for 8 weeks followed by a 30 mg/kg dose of streptozotocin. Eight weeks after the onset of hyperglycemia diabetic rats were treated with a combination of enalapril, \u03b1-lipoic acid and menhaden oil. Diabetic rats not receiving treatment were continued on the high fat diet. Glucose clearance was impaired in diabetic rats and significantly improved with treatment. Diabetes caused steatosis, elevated serum lipid levels, slowing of motor and sensory nerve conduction, thermal hypoalgesia, reduction in intraepidermal nerve fiber profiles, decrease in cornea sub-basal nerve fiber length and corneal sensitivity and impairment in vascular relaxation to acetylcholine and calcitonin gene-related peptide in epineurial arterioles of the sciatic nerve. Treating diabetic rats with the combination of enalapril, \u03b1-lipoic acid and menhaden oil reversed all these deficits to near control levels except for motor nerve conduction velocity which was also significantly improved compared to diabetic rats but remained significantly decreased compared to control rats.

Our results showed that 310-day pretreatment of 30-day-old HCMHs with EMD significantly prevented cardiac necrosis, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, and reduced the heart to body mass ratio. This treatment significantly prevented Na(+) and Ca(2+) overloads and the increase in NHE-1 protein level observed in HCMHs. Importantly, this lifelong preventive treatment significantly decreased the levels of creatine kinase and prevented early death of HCMHs. Curative treatment of hypertrophic 275-day-old HCMHs for 85 days with EMD significantly prevented hypertrophy and early death of HCMHs. However, treatments with cilazapril did not have any significant effects on the cardiac parameters studied or on early death of HCMHs. Our results suggest that the increase in the NHE-1 level and the consequent Na(+) and Ca(2+) overloads are implicated in the pathological process leading to heart failure and early death in HCMHs, and treatment with the NHE-1 inhibitor is promising for preventing early death in hereditary cardiomyopathy.",

The MiniReview presents the data of four available trials NCT01193101, NCT00549770, NCT00887588 and NCT01035255 and provides the current knowledge about LCZ696 effects in patients with hypertension and heart failure. Presently, patients suffering from hypertension and heart failure are treated with ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor antagonists often in combination with other drugs. These current medications lead to a reduction in blood pressure in hypertensive patients and a decreased mortality and morbidity in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, but not in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. LCZ696 had been tested to utilize the beneficial properties of natriuretic peptides in combination with angiotensin receptor antagonism. It induces even greater blood pressure reductions and decreased mortality and morbidity in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, while patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction show lowered blood pressure and decreased NT-pro-BNP levels. Although long-term studies remain to be performed, these initial data suggest that there is a potential clinical benefit of LCZ696 in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure.",

Cell viability was determined by alamarBlue and protein assays. Nuclei morphology was analysed by DAPI staining. TRAP assays were performed as follows: p-nitrophenyl phosphate was used to determine the acid phosphatase activity of the osteoclasts and TRAP staining was used to evaluate the number and size of TRAP-positive multinucleated osteoclast cells. Von Kossa staining was used to measure osteoclast resorptive activity. Cytokine levels were measured on osteoclast precursor cell culture supernatants. Using western blot analysis, p-I\u03baB\u03b1 and I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation, inhibitor of NF-kappaB, were evaluated. Results. Both AcE and Qt did not affect cell viability and significantly reduced osteoclastogenesis compared to control. We observed lower production of IL-6 and IL-1\u03b1 and an increased production of IL-3 and IL-4. AcE and Qt downregulated NF-\u03baB pathway. Conclusion.

    "1015": "Existing therapies for traumatic brain injuries (TBI) only relieve the symptoms of patients but do not treat the underlying causes that lead to debilitating effects of the trauma. One of the well understood molecular mechanism of TBI is the hyperactivation of the calpain enzyme. The need for drugs to inhibit the effect of the enzyme is viewed as one of the neurotherapies for traumatic brain injury. In this chapter, we summarize one of the strategies in finding small molecules to slow down or even eliminate the devastating effect of calpain hyperactivation. The brain is a well-protected organ. Because of the very fragile nature of the brain, the organ is encased in a series of bone, membrane, and fluid-based protection. But despite all the privileges the brain is bestowed with, the organ is still very vulnerable to damage. A car accident, a football tackle, and an explosive\u2019s shock wave from a blast are all blows to the head that can set off a chain reaction, rendering the victim at least incapacitated or at worst, dead. At the molecular level, it is now well-documented that part of the damage is from the hyperactivation of calpain. Calpain is a tightly regulated Ca(2+)-dependent proteolytic enzyme that plays a critical role in important signaling pathways, including synaptic function and memory formation. Calpain exerts its biological function through limited proteolysis of its substrates. However, in some pathological conditions, such as after a TBI, calpain is dysregulated and participates in cell injury and death. In TBI, neuronal calpains are hyperactivated within minutes after the initial trauma event, causing early damage to specific areas of the brain (Huh et al., 2007; Kampfl et al., 1996; Liu et al., 2006; Pike et al., 1998, 2001; Posmantur et al., 1997; Thompson et al., 2006; Upadhya et al., 2003; Warren et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2007; Zhao et al., 1998a, 1998b, 2000). In multiple models of TBI, sustained calpain activation is associated with neuronal and axonal cell death. Calpain is not just linked to TBI but also to a handful of neurogenerative diseases. These neurogenerative pathologies include cerebral ischemia (Blomgren et al., 1999; Garcia-Bonilla et al., 2006; Gutierrez et al., 2007; Hong et al., 1994; Johnson et al., 1997; Kambe et al., 2005; Liebetrau et al., 1999; Minger et al., 1998; Neumar et al., 1996; Tsubokawa et al., 2006), Alzheimer\u2019s disease (DiRosa et al., 2002; Garg et al., 2011; Getz, 2012; Grynspan et al., 1997; Iwamoto et al., 1991; Medeiros et al., 2012; Tsuji et al., 1998), multiple sclerosis (Das et al., 2008; Shields et al., 1999), Huntington\u2019s disease (Bizat et al., 2003; Gafni and Ellerby, 2002; Gladding et al., 2012), prion-related encephalopathy (Gray et al., 2006; Hachiya et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2005; Yadavalli et al., 2004), and Parkinson\u2019s disease (Alvira et al., 2008; Mouatt-Prigent et al., 1996; Ray et al., 2000; Samantaray et al., 2008). Enzyme inhibition is a well-known strategy for therapy development, and based on our understanding of calpain in the pathology of brain injury, this enzyme is an attractive therapeutic target. Calpain inhibitors probably came out at the same time as the discovery of the said enzyme 40 years ago. However, these inhibitors were general protease inhibitors, lacking selectivity and therefore inhibiting other proteases such as the proteasome and cathepsins. Interest in making selective calpain inhibitors sprung from the need to pinpoint the specific role(s) of calpain in the body. Subsequent years of research in calpain inhibitors led to a variety of compounds, most of which are small molecules (average MW ~500 g/mole). As drug candidates, small-molecule compounds have some advantages over peptides or proteins, such as the ability to penetrate cells and resistance to proteolytic degradation. However, peptide and protein drug candidates exhibit higher selectivity toward their targets. A desirable treatment strategy in a clinical setting is through oral administration with a convenient dosing schedule, probably twice a day frequency of ingestion. These desirable pharmacological properties of a drug that can be taken orally and dosed once or twice daily are all met by small molecule compounds. In addition, small molecules are simpler: only a small portion of the enzyme, the active site is targeted to render the enzyme unable to perform its function. Compared with the whole enzyme, the active site is relatively small in comparison to the total volume of the macromolecule. This is akin to poking a small hole in the gas tank of a car so that the whole automobile cannot function. The active site is precisely arranged in a three-dimensional structure to facilitate the catalysis of substrates. This is generally where the action occurs, and rendering the active site unable to perform its duty (or partially incapacitated) is one of the goals of small molecule inhibitors. Designing small molecules as inhibitors is a strategy that is common in the pharmaceutical industry. In the market today, small-molecule enzyme inhibitors comprise half of all drugs. Pharmaceutical companies will still continue to follow in that direction, developing small molecules to inhibit dysregulated enzymes. And there are relatively a lot of success stories in drug development that targets enzymes. An example of this is the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor for treating hypertension. ACE converts angiotensin I into angiotensin II, resulting in blood vessel constriction and eventually increasing blood pressure. Blocking ACE lowers blood pressure. Pfizer\u2019s Viagra, a drug that blocks the enzyme cyclic guanosine monophosphate\u2013specific phosphodiesterase type 5 to combat erectile dysfunction, is another blockbuster success. There has been a focus on designing new inhibitors of proteases that have been identified as disease-causing proteolytic enzymes. In addition to the successfully inhibited enzymes mentioned earlier, several inhibitors of a number of proteases are believed to progress from purely research to clinical trials. Bayer has developed a cathepsin K inhibitor (AAE581) to treat osteoporosis (Falgueyret et al., 2005). We saw the development of a serine aminopeptidase inhibitor, vildagliptin, as a therapy for type 2 diabetes (Deacon and Holst, 2006), and another ACE inhibitor (Aliskiren) that is an alternative to the current ACE inhibitor drugs (Stanton, 2003). In this chapter, we will address the issues and challenges in drug discovery, specifically for the viability of small molecule inhibitors to regulate the destructive effects of calpain hyperactivation during or after TBI. Broadly, the enzyme (2) calpain will be discussed, followed by (3) calpain inhibitors, (4) challenges in realizing a therapy for brain injury, and then THE (5) conclusion. We hope that this chapter will provide students and scientists in brain injury research an overview of the potential of small-molecule calpain inhibitors in TBI drug development.", 
    "1016": "The aim of the study was to determine whether an elevated IgA level at the time of the diagnosis of IgA nephropathy has an effect on the severity of kidney biopsy findings and long-term outcomes in children. We retrospectively studied 89 children with IgA nephropathy who were stratified into Group 1- elevated serum IgA and Group 2 - normal serum IgA at baseline. The level of IgA, proteinuria, hematuria, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and hypertension (HTN) were compared at baseline and after the end of the follow-up period of 4.0\u2009\u00b1\u20093.1 years. Kidney biopsy findings were evaluated using the Oxford classification. The evaluation of treatment included immunosuppressive therapy and renoprotection with angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), or no treatment. The elevated serum IgA was found in 46 (52 %) patients and normal serum IgA level was found in 43 (48 %) patients. No differences were found between the two groups regarding the mean age of patients, proteinuria, and the number of patients with reduced GFR or HTN at baseline. In kidney biopsy, mesangial proliferation and segmental sclerosis were significantly more common in Group 1 compared with Group 2 (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Immunosuppressive therapy was used in 67 % children in Group 1 and 75 % children in Group 2. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves for renal function (with normal GFR) and persistent proteinuria did not differ significantly depending on the serum IgA level at baseline. We conclude that in IgA nephropathy the elevated serum IgA at baseline may be associated with mesangial proliferation and segmental sclerosis contribute to glomerulosclerosis, but has no effect on the presence of proteinuria or on the worsening of kidney function during several years of disease course.",

Patients with disproportionately high catecholamine responses to stressful events are prone to worse clinical outcomes. Catecholamines stimulate platelet activation and, therefore, may determine the clinical presentation and outcomes of TCM. We conducted a retrospective, descriptive study TCM patients admitted between 2003 and 2013 to Einstein Medical Center, Philadelphia, PA, USA and Danbury Hospital, Danbury, CT, USA.

    "1024": "We previously demonstrated that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) could be inhibited by soy milk that had been fermented with the Lactobacillus plantarum strain TWK10, suggesting great potential for the development of antihypertensive products. In this work, the bioactive ACE inhibitors in TWK10-fermented soy milk water extracts were isolated, and a combination of uracil and glycerol (CUG) was identified as one of the ACE inhibitors. We then examined the physiological effects of CUG treatment in short-term and long-term studies using spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) as an experimental model. The results revealed that the fermented soy milk extracts and CUG decreased blood pressure by 11.97 \u00b1 3.71 to 19.54 \u00b1 9.54 mmHg, 8 h after oral administration, and exhibited antihypertensive effects in SHRs in a long-term study. In addition, CUG was shown to decrease blood pressure by suppressing either the renin activity or the ACE activity and, thus, decreasing the downstream vasoconstricting peptide angiotensin II and the hormone aldosterone. CUG also promoted nitric oxide production, resulting in vasodilation and further improvement to hypertension. This important finding suggests that TWK10-fermented soy milk and its functional ingredients, uracil and glycerol, exhibit antihypertensive effects via multiple pathways and provide a healthier and more natural antihypertensive functional food.",

Treatment of systemic HTN is beneficial because the combination of HTN and AS provides additional overload to the left ventricle. This leads to secondary Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), which has been shown to increase cardiovascular risks and mortality and thus early presentation of symptoms of AS. Additionally, presence of HTN may affect the accurate assessment of AS. Different treatment options are available, however no specific treatment guidelines have been established for patients with concomitant AS and HTN. Improved control of HTN is the key to prevent symptom progression and inadvertent early surgery.

The aim of this study was to further characterize the local RAS in human and rat periodontal tissues between healthy and periodontally-affected tissue. Components of the RAS were investigated using in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo experiments involving both human and Wistar rat periodontium. Although not upregulated when challenged with P. gingivalis-lipopolysaccharide, human gingival and periodontal ligament fibroblasts expressed RAS components. Likewise, healthy and inflamed human gingiva expressed RAS components, some of which were shown to be functional, yet no differences in expression were found between healthy and diseased gingiva. However, in inflamed tissue the immunoreactivity was greater for the AT1R compared to AT2R in fibroblasts. When compared to healthy tissue, ACE activity was increased in human gingiva from volunteers with gingivitis. Human-gingiva homogenates generated Ang II, Ang 1-9 and Ang 1-7 when incubated with precursors. In gingiva homogenates, Ang II formation from Ang I was nearly abolished only when captopril and chymostatin were combined. Ang 1-7 formation was significantly greater when human gingiva homogenates were incubated with chymostatin alone compared to incubation without any inhibitor, only captopril, or captopril and chymostatin. In rat gingiva, RAS components were also found; their expression was not different between healthy and experimentally induced periodontitis (EP) groups. However, renin inhibition (aliskiren) and an AT1R antagonist (losartan) significantly blocked EP-alveolar-bone loss in rats. Collectively, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that a local RAS system is not only present but is also functional in both human and rat periodontal tissue. Furthermore, blocking AT1R and renin can significantly prevent periodontal bone loss induced by EP in rats.",

    "1087": "Hospitalized patients with ACE-I in their therapy at discharge were included in 3 groups as follows: ACE-I, DT (double therapy with ACE-I and NSAIDs) and TT (triple therapy with ACE-I, NSAIDs and diuretics) groups. We evaluated differences on demographic characteristics, co-morbidities, medications, laboratory monitoring and quantified the patients with serum creatinine and potassium levels above the UNL using descriptive statistics. Logistic regression analysis with backward elimination was performed to identify significant predictors of combination therapy.", 
    "1088": "Of 9960 admitted patients, 1214 were prescribed ACE-I, 40 were prescribed ACE-I/NSAIDs and 22 were prescribed ACE-I/NSAIDs/diuretics (3.13% and 1.72%, respectively, of the patients prescribed with ACE-I). Serum creatinine and potassium were monitored for the great majority of patients from all groups. The highest percentage of hyperkalemia was found in the DT group (10% of the patients) and of serum creatinine above UNL in the TT group (45.45%). The logistic regression final model showed that younger patients and monitoring for potassium were significantly associated with combination therapy.",

    "1090": "Urinary albumin excretion and/or albumin to creatinine ratio are associated with CKD and higher risk of cardiovascular events. Several studies investigated the effect of reduced dietary sodium intake on urinary albumin excretion and/or albumin to creatinine ratio in adult patient populations, but the majority was inconclusive because of insufficient statistical power. A meta-analysis of the randomized, controlled trials available could overcome this problem and lead to more definitive conclusions.", 
    "1091": "A systematic search of the online databases available (from 1996 to October of 2014) was conducted of randomized, controlled trials that expressed urinary albumin excretion or albumin to creatinine ratio as the difference between the effects of two different sodium intake regimens. For each study, the mean difference and 95% confidence intervals were pooled using a random effect model. Heterogeneity, publication bias, subgroup, and meta-regression analyses were performed.", 
    "1092": "Eleven studies met the predefined inclusion criteria and provided 23 cohorts with 516 participants and 1-6 weeks of follow-up time. In the pooled analysis, an average reduction in sodium intake of 92 mmol/d was associated with a 32.1% (95% confidence interval, -44.3 to -18.8) reduction in urinary albumin excretion. The effect of sodium restriction was higher in the cohorts including patients on concomitant renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system-blocking therapy, in the studies with intervention lasting at least 2 weeks, and among participants with evidence of kidney damage. A greater reduction of urinary albumin excretion was associated with a higher decrease in BP during the intervention. The analysis of changes in albumin to creatinine ratio provided similar results.", 
    "1093": "This meta-analysis indicates that sodium intake reduction markedly reduces albumin excretion, more so during concomitant renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system-blocking therapy and among patients with kidney damage.", 
    "1094": "Angiotensin II (Ang II) has been shown to activate multiple downstream pathways resulting in endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress. Baicalin, a natural flavone, exerts anti-oxidant and anti-apoptotic effects in cardiovascular diseases. In the present study, we hypothesized that baicalin has beneficial effects in Ang II-induced endothelial cells injury. Here, we shown that baicalin improved endothelial fuction impaired by Ang II through promoting endothelial-dependent vasodilation and suppressing the apoptosis of HUVECs in which baicalin decreased the expression of bax and cleaved caspase-3, and increased bcl-2 expression. Additionally, baicalin significantly conversed Ang II to angiotensin-1-7 [Ang-(1-7)] by activating angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and Mas receptor mRNA expression and protein expression. Moreover, treatment with baicalin significantly reduced cell oxidative damage induced by Ang II through MDA/ROS decrease and NO/T-AOC increase. This antioxidant capacity was related to the increases of PI3K, phosphor-AKT (Ser-473) and phosphor-eNOS (Ser-1177). In conclusion, our results implicate that baicalin could protect endothelial cells from Ang II-induced endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress via modulating the expression of bax, bcl-2 and cleaved caspase-3, activating ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis and up-regulating PI3K/AKT/eNOS pathway.",

Patients with MP-IgAN had significantly milder pathological symptoms than those with IgAN. The most frequently used therapeutic regimes were angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (30.2%) and no therapy (36.8%). None of the patients with MP-IgAN reached stage III chronic kidney disease within 15 years after onset.

    "1107": "We have employed three-dimensional (3D) extrusion-based printing as a medicine manufacturing technique for the production of multi-active tablets with well-defined and separate controlled release profiles for three different drugs. This 'polypill' made by a 3D additive manufacture technique demonstrates that complex medication regimes can be combined in a single tablet and that it is viable to formulate and 'dial up' this single tablet for the particular needs of an individual. The tablets used to illustrate this concept incorporate an osmotic pump with the drug captopril and sustained release compartments with the drugs nifedipine and glipizide. This combination of medicines could potentially be used to treat diabetics suffering from hypertension. The room temperature extrusion process used to print the formulations used excipients commonly employed in the pharmaceutical industry. Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) were used to assess drug-excipient interaction. The printed formulations were evaluated for drug release using USP dissolution testing. We found that the captopril portion showed the intended zero order drug release of an osmotic pump and noted that the nifedipine and glipizide portions showed either first order release or Korsmeyer-Peppas release kinetics dependent upon the active/excipient ratio used.",

    "1112": "We have previously shown that cough potentiation induced by intravenous administration of the AT1 receptor antagonist losartan is lower than that induced by the ACE inhibitor lisinopril in anesthetized and awake rabbits. Since losartan and lisinopril cross the blood-brain barrier, their central action on the cough reflex can be hypothesized. Mechanical stimulation of the tracheobronchial tree and citric acid inhalation were used to induce cough reflex responses in pentobarbital sodium-anesthetized, spontaneously breathing rabbits. Bilateral microinjections (30-50 nl) of losartan (5mM), lisinopril (1mM), bradykinin (0.05 mM), HOE-140 (0.2mM, a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist) and CP-99,994 (1mM, an NK1 receptor antagonist) were performed into the caudal nucleus tractus solitarii, the predominant site of termination of cough-related afferents. Lisinopril, but not losartan increased the cough number. This effect was reverted by HOE-140 or CP-99,994. Cough potentiation was also induced by bradykinin. The results support for the first time a central protussive action of lisinopril mediated by an accumulation of bradykinin and substance P.", 
    "1113": "Preeclampsia is a low-grade systemic inflammatory condition in which oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction occurs. Plasma levels of soluble receptor for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFR)-1, also known as sFlt1 (soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1), an antiangiogenic factor have been reported to be elevated in preeclampsia. It was reported that pregnant mice deficient in catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) activity show a preeclampsia-like phenotype due to a deficiency or absence of 2-methoxyoestradiol (2-ME), a natural metabolite of estradiol that is elevated during the third trimester of normal human pregnancy. Additionally, autoantibodies (AT1-AAs) that bind and activate the angiotensin II receptor type 1 a (AT1 receptor) also have a role in preeclampsia. None of these abnormalities are consistently seen in all the patients with preeclampsia and some of them are not specific to pregnancy. Preeclampsia could occur due to an imbalance between pro- and antiangiogenic factors. VEGF, an angiogenic factor, is necessary for the transport of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) to endothelial cells. Hence reduced VEGF levels decrease the availability of PUFAs to endothelial cells. This leads to a decrease in the formation of anti-inflammatory and angiogenic factors: lipoxins, resolvins, protectins, and maresins from PUFAs. Lipoxins, resolvins, protectins, maresins, and PUFAs suppress insulin resistance; activation of leukocytes, platelets, and macrophages; production of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1; and oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction; and enhance production of prostacyclin and nitric oxide (NO). Estrogen enhances the formation of lipoxin A4 and NO. PUFAs also augment the production of NO and inhibit the activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme and antagonize the actions of angiotensin II. Thus, PUFAs can prevent activation of angiotensin II receptor type 1 a (AT1 receptor). Patients with preeclampsia have decreased plasma phospholipid concentrations of arachidonic acid (AA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), the precursors of lipoxins (from AA), resolvins (from EPA and DHA), and protectins (from DHA) and prostaglandin E1 (PGE1 from DGLA: dihomo-\u03b3-linolenic acid) and prostacyclin (PGI2 derived from AA). Based on these evidences, it is proposed that preeclampsia may occur due to deficiency of PUFAs and their anti-inflammatory products: lipoxins, resolvins, protectins, and maresins.", 
    "1114": "Outcome is better in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC) than in ischemic heart failure (HF), but morbidity and mortality are nevertheless presumed to be substantial. Most data on the prognosis in IDC stem from research performed before the widespread use of current evidence-based treatment, including implantable devices. We report outcome data from a cohort of patients with IDC treated according to current HF guidelines and compare our results with previous figures: 102 consecutive patients referred to our tertiary care hospital with idiopathic IDC and a left ventricular ejection fraction <40% were included in a prospective cohort study. After extensive baseline work-up, follow-up was performed after 6 and 13 months. Vital status and heart transplantation were recorded. Over the first year of follow-up, the patients were on optimal pharmacological treatment, and 24 patients received implantable devices. Left ventricular ejection fraction increased from 26 \u00b1 10% to 41 \u00b1 11%, peak oxygen consumption increased from 19.5 \u00b1 7.1 to 23.4 \u00b1 7.8 ml/kg/min, and functional class improved substantially (all p values <0.001). After a median follow-up of 3.6 years, 4 patients were dead, and heart transplantation had been performed in 9 patients. According to our literature search, survival in patients with IDC has improved substantially over the last decades. In conclusion, patients with IDC have a better outcome than previously reported when treated according to current guidelines.", 
    "1115": "Cardiorenal syndrome type 5 (CRS-5) includes conditions where there is a simultaneous involvement of the heart and kidney from a systemic disorder. This is a bilateral organ cross talk. Fabry's disease (FD) is a devastating progressive inborn error of metabolism with lysosomal glycosphingolipid deposition in variety of cell types, capillary endothelial cells, renal, cardiac and nerve cells. Basic effect is absent or deficient activity of lysosomal exoglycohydrolase a-galactosidase A. Renal involvement consists of proteinuria, isosthenuria, altered tubular function, presenting in second or third decade leading to azotemia and end-stage renal disease in third to fifth decade mainly due to irreversible changes to glomerular, tubular and vascular structures, especially highlighted by podocytes foot process effacement. Cardiac involvement consists of left ventricular hypertrophy, right ventricular hypertrophy, arrhythmias (sinus node and conduction system impairment), diastolic dysfunction, myocardial ischemia, infarction, transmural replacement fibrosis, congestive heart failure and cardiac death. Management of FD is based on enzymatic replacement therapy and control of renal (with anti-proteinuric agents such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors-and/or angiotensin II receptor blockers), brain (coated aspirin, clopidogrel and statin to prevent strokes) and heart complications (calcium channel blockers for ischemic cardiomyopathy, warfarin and amiodarone or cardioverter device for arrhythmias)."
