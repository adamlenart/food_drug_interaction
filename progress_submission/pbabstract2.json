The cohort consisted of all patients newly treated with antihypertensive drugs between 1 January 1995 and 31 December 2009, with follow-up until 31 December 2010. Cases were patients with newly diagnosed pancreatic cancer, which were matched with up to 10 controls on age, sex, calendar year of cohort entry, and duration of follow-up. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of pancreatic cancer incidence associated with ever use of ACEIs and ARBs.

Patients were divided as follows: a positive SPECT group [119 (54.6%) patients] and a negative SPECT group [99 (45.4%) patients]. The effects of thyroid diseases and use of calcium channel blockers, \u03b2-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, oral antidiabetics, thyroid hormone preparates, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and proton pump inhibitors on the sensitivity of Tc-99m MIBI dual-phase parathyroid SPECT were investigated.",

The sensitivity was low only in nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug users (75.6%) compared with nonusers (96.5%). Logistic regression showed that ultrasonography was indicative of a positive scan and the possibility of a negative result was increased by regular usage of nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs (odds ratio: 0.262, confidence interval: 0.128-0.538; P<0.001) CONCLUSION: Among various drug groups, NSAIDs may decrease the sensitivity of Tc-99m MIBI SPECT and, provided that these novel data are supported by other studies, patient preparation may be modified to stop NSAIDs before Tc-99m MIBI dual-phase parathyroid SPECT.", 
    "7": "Paclitaxel is a chemotherapeutic agent used to treat solid tumours. However, it causes an acute and neuropathic pain syndrome that limits its use. Among the mechanisms involved in neuropathic pain caused by paclitaxel is activation of kinin receptors. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors can enhance kinin receptor signalling. The goal of this study was to evaluate the role of kinins on paclitaxel-associated acute pain syndromes (P-APS) and the effect of ACE inhibition on P-APS and paclitaxel-associated chronic peripheral neuropathy (P-CPN) in mice. Herein, we show that paclitaxel caused mechanical allodynia and spontaneous nociceptive behaviour that was reduced by antagonists of kinin receptors B1 (DALBk and SSR240612) and B2 (Hoe140 and FR173657). Moreover, enalapril (an ACE inhibitor) enhanced the mechanical allodynia induced by a low dose of paclitaxel. Likewise, paclitaxel injection inhibited ACE activity and increased the expressions of B1 and B2 receptors and bradykinin-related peptides levels in peripheral tissue. Together, our data support the involvement of kinin receptors in the P-APS and suggest kinin receptor antagonists to treat this syndrome. Because hypertension is the most frequent comorbidity affecting cancer patients, treatment of hypertension with ACE inhibitors in patients undergoing paclitaxel chemotherapy should be reviewed, since this could enhance the P-APS and P-CPN.",

When renal Na(+) excretion is inadequate, blood pressure rises and serves as a homeostatic signal to drive natriuresis to re-establish effective circulating volume (ECV). Recognizing that hypertension involves both renal and vascular dysfunction, this report concerns proximal tubule Na(+)/H(+) exchanger 3 (PT NHE3) regulation during acute and chronic hypertension. NHE3 is distributed in tall microvilli (MV) in the PT where it reabsorbs a significant fraction of the filtered Na(+). NHE3 redistributes, in the plane of the MV membrane, between the MV body, where NHE3 is active, and MV base where NHE3 is less active. High salt diet and acute hypertension both retract NHE3 to the base and reduce PT Na(+) reabsorption independent of a change in abundance. The renin angiotensin system provokes NHE3 redistribution independent of blood pressure: the ACE inhibitor captopril redistributes NHE3 to the base and subsequent AngII infusion returns NHE3 to the body of the microvilli and restores reabsorption. Chronic AngII infusion presents simultaneous AngII stimulation and hypertension: NHE3 remains in the body of the MV, due to the high local AngII and inflammation, and exhibits a compensatory decrease in abundance, driven by the hypertension. Genetically modified mice with blunted hypertensive responses to chronic AngII infusion (due to lack of PT AngII receptors, IL-17A or IFN-\u03b3 expression) exhibit reduced local AngII accumulation and inflammation and larger decreases in NHE3 abundance which improve the pressure natriuresis responses and reduces the need for elevated BP to facilitate circulating volume balance.", 
    "24": "Although the incidence of cardiovascular diseases classically associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has decreased considerably with antiretroviral therapy, cardiovascular risk, and especially ischemic heart disease, are higher in HIV-infected patients than in uninfected individuals. This is due to the interaction of patient-dependent factors with virus-dependent factors, as well as factors associated with antiretroviral therapy. With increasing of life expectancy and the chronicity of HIV infection, cardiovascular disease has emerged as an important cause of morbidity and mortality in HIV patients. In developed countries, the most common cardiovascular manifestation of HIV is ischemic heart disease. Currently, it is not uncommon to find HIV patients with acute coronary syndrome and, given the important pharmacokinetic interactions of antiretroviral drugs, it is important to know which cardiovascular treatments are safe in this group of patients. The ideal approach would be to mitigate the cardiovascular risk in HIV patients with specific primary prevention measures. All these issues are discussed in this review, which aims to aid clinical cardiologists faced with HIV patients with ischemic heart disease or with high cardiovascular risk in daily clinical practice.",

Furthermore, to identify possible mechanisms of action based on structure-activity relationships and molecular docking. The in vitro ACE inhibition activity relied on determining hippuric acid (HA) formation from ACE-specific substrate (hippuryl-histidyl-leucine (HHL)) by the action of ACE enzyme. A High Performance Liquid Chromatography method combined with UV detection was developed and validated for measurement the concentration of produced HA. The chelation ability of OS extract and its reference compounds was evaluated by tetramethylmurexide reagent. Furthermore, molecular docking study was performed by LeadIT-FlexX: BioSolveIT's LeadIT program. OS ethanolic extract (OS-E) exhibited highest inhibition and lowest IC50 value (45.77 \u00b1 1.17 \u00b5g/mL) against ACE compared to the other extracts.

Molecular docking studies also confirmed that flavonoids inhibit ACE via interaction with the zinc ion and this interaction is stabilized by other interactions with amino acids in the active site. In this study, we have demonstrated that changes in flavonoids active core affect their capacity to inhibit ACE. Moreover, we showed that ACE inhibition activity of flavonoids compounds is directly related to their ability to bind with zinc ion in the active site of ACE enzyme. It was also revealed that OS extract contained high amount of flavonoids other than RA, TMF, SIN and EUP. As such, application of OS extract is useful as inhibitors of ACE.",

The most frequent side effects include cardiovascular complications, which can lead to acute and delayed morbidity and mortality, often many years later. The discipline of cardio-oncology deals with the prevention, diagnostics and treatment of cardiovascular diseases caused by cancer therapy. The most important cardiovascular side effects of cytostatic therapy are heart failure due to myocardial dysfunction (cardiotoxicity), coronary artery disease, valvular disease and ventricular arrhythmia as a result of QT extension. In addition, arterial hypertension, thromboembolic events, pulmonary hypertension, vasculopathy and pericardial complications can also occur. Fundamentally, a strict limitation of risk factors is necessary to minimize the cardiovascular side effects of potentially cardiotoxic therapeutic procedures. Patients with impaired left ventricular function should be identified by echocardiographic examination prior to cardiotoxic chemotherapy. Treatment with beta blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors can also be indicated in asymptomatic patients in order to minimize the effects of chemotherapy on myocardial dysfunction.

Patients were grouped according to low potassium (<3.5 mEq/l), normal potassium (3.5 to 5.0 mEq/l), and high potassium (>5.0 mEq/l) levels. Results were verified in a validation cohort of 1,023 patients. Mean age of patients was 71 \u00b1 11\u00a0years, and 66% were men.

Patients with high potassium more often used angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists before admission, had impaired baseline renal function and a better diuretic response (p\u00a0= 0.005), independent of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist usage. During 180-day follow-up, a total of 330 patients (18%) died. Potassium levels at admission showed a univariate linear association with mortality (hazard ratio [log] 2.36, 95% confidence interval 1.07 to 5.23; p\u00a0= 0.034) but not after multivariate adjustment. Changes of potassium levels during hospitalization or potassium levels at discharge were not associated with outcome after multivariate analysis. Results in the validation cohort were similar to the index cohort. In conclusion, high potassium levels at admission are associated with an impaired renal function but a better diuretic response. Changes in potassium levels are common, and overall levels increase during hospitalization.

Although interest surrounds use of immunosuppressive agents added to standard therapy, several recent studies have questioned efficacy of these agents. Depleting antibody-producing B cells potentially offers a new therapy. In this open label, multicenter study conducted over 1-year follow-up, we randomized 34 adult patients with biopsy-proven IgA nephropathy and proteinuria >1 g/d, maintained on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers with well controlled BP and eGFR<90 ml/min per 1.73 m(2), to receive standard therapy or rituximab with standard therapy. Primary outcome measures included change in proteinuria and change in eGFR. Median baseline serum creatinine level (range) was 1.4 (0.8-2.4) mg/dl, and proteinuria was 2.1 (0.6-5.3) g/d. Treatment with rituximab depleted B cells and was well tolerated. eGFR did not change in either group. Rituximab did not alter the level of proteinuria compared with that at baseline or in the control group; three patients in each group had \u226550% reduction in level of proteinuria. Serum levels of galactose-deficient IgA1 or antibodies against galactose-deficient IgA1 did not change. In this trial, rituximab therapy did not significantly improve renal function or proteinuria assessed over 1 year. Although rituximab effectively depleted B cells, it failed to reduce serum levels of galactose-deficient IgA1 and antigalactose-deficient IgA1 antibodies. Lack of efficacy of rituximab, at least at this stage and severity of IgA nephropathy, may reflect a failure of rituximab to reduce levels of specific antibodies assigned salient pathogenetic roles in IgA nephropathy.",

    "52": "Senescence, as assessed by senescence-associated \u03b2-galactosidase activity, was induced by the passaging of porcine coronary artery ECs from passage P1 to P4, and was associated with a progressive shedding of procoagulant MPs. Exposure of P1 ECs to MPs shed from senescent P3 cells or circulating MPs from ACS patients induced increased senescence-associated \u03b2-galactosidase activity, oxidative stress, early phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and Akt, and upregulation of p53, p21, and p16. Ex vivo, the prosenescent effect of circulating MPs from ACS patients was evidenced only under conditions of low shear stress. Depletion of endothelial-derived MPs from ACS patients reduced the induction of senescence. Prosenescent MPs promoted EC thrombogenicity through tissue factor upregulation, shedding of procoagulant MPs, endothelial nitric oxide synthase downregulation, and reduced nitric oxide-mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation. These MPs exhibited angiotensin-converting enzyme activity and upregulated AT1 receptors and angiotensin-converting enzyme in P1 ECs. Losartan, an AT1 receptor antagonist, and inhibitors of either mitogen-activated protein kinases or phosphoinositide 3-kinase prevented the MP-induced endothelial senescence.", 
    "53": "These findings indicate that endothelial-derived MPs from ACS patients induce premature endothelial senescence under atheroprone low shear stress and thrombogenicity through angiotensin II-induced redox-sensitive activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt.

Results. Incubation with ANG I resulted in higher concentration of ANG II (P = 0.02, vehicle pretreatment) and lower of ANG (1-9) (P = 0.048, perindoprilat pretreatment) in diabetes.

Within the classical pathway, ratios of ANG IV/ANG II (P = 0.01) and of ANG IV/ANG III (P = 0.049), but not of ANG III/ANG II are lower in diabetes. Conclusions. Diabetes in rats led to preference toward deleterious (ANG II, ANG III) over protective (ANG IV, ANG (1-9), and ANG (1-7)) ANG I metabolites.", 
    "105": "Recent work from this laboratory showed that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced apoptosis of alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) is regulated by the autocrine angiotensin (ANG)II/ANG1-7 system. The proteasome inhibitor MG132 or surfactant protein C (SP-C) BRICHOS domain mutation G100S induced apoptosis in human AECs by activating the proapoptotic cathepsin D and reducing antiapoptotic angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2). This study tested the hypothesis that ER stress-induced apoptosis of human AECs might be mediated by influence of the unfolded protein response (UPR) on the autocrine ANGII/ANG1-7 system. A549 cells were challenged with MG132 or SP-C BRICHOS domain mutant G100S to induce ER stress and activation of UPR pathways. The results showed that either MG132 or G100S SP-C mutation activated all three canonical pathways of the UPR (IRE1/XBP1, ATF6, and PERK/eIF2\u03b1), which led to a significant increase in cathepsin D or in TACE (an ACE-2 ectodomain shedding enzyme) and eventually caused AEC apoptosis. However, ER stress-induced AEC apoptosis could be prevented by chemical chaperone or by UPR blockers. It is also suggested that ATF6 and IRE1 pathways might play important role in regulation of angiotensin system. These data demonstrate that ER stress induces apoptosis in human AECs through mediation of UPR pathways, which in turn regulate the autocrine ANGII/ANG1-7 system. They also demonstrated that ER stress-induced AEC apoptosis can be blocked by inhibition of UPR signaling pathways.", 
    "106": "While angiotensin II blockade slows the progression of diabetic nephropathy, current data suggest that it alone cannot stop the disease process. New therapies or drug combinations will be required to further slow or halt disease progression. Inhibition of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) aimed at enhancing ECM degradation has shown therapeutic potential in diabetic nephropathy. Here, using a mouse model of type diabetes, the maximally therapeutic dose of the PAI-1-neutralizing mouse monoclonal antibody (MEDI-579) was determined and compared with the maximally effective dose of enalapril. We then examined whether addition of MEDI-579 to enalapril would enhance the efficacy in slowing the progression of diabetic nephropathy. Untreated uninephrectomized diabetic db/db mice developed progressive albuminuria and glomerulosclerosis associated with increased expression of transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21, PAI-1, type IV collagen, and fibronectin from weeks 18 to 22, which were reduced by MEDI-579 at 3 mg/kg body wt, similar to enalapril given alone from weeks 12 to 22 Adding MEDI-579 to enalapril from weeks 18 to 22 resulted in further reduction in albuminuria and markers of renal fibrosis. Renal plasmin generation was dramatically reduced by 57% in diabetic mice, a decrease that was partially reversed by MEDI-579 or enalapril given alone but was further restored by these two treatments given in combination. Our results suggest that MEDI-579 is effective in slowing the progression of diabetic nephropathy in db/db mice and that the effect is additive to ACEI. While enalapril is renal protective, the add-on PAI-1 antibody may offer additional renoprotection in progressive diabetic nephropathy via enhancing ECM turnover.",

    "112": "Accessory cholera enterotoxin (Ace) of Vibrio cholerae has been shown to contribute to diarrhea. However, the signaling mechanism and specific type of Cl(-) channel activated by Ace are still unknown. We have shown here that the recombinant Ace protein induced ICl of apical plasma membrane, which was inhibited by classical CaCC blockers. Surprisingly, an Ace-elicited rise of current was neither affected by ANO1 (TMEM16A)-specific inhibitor T16A(inh)-AO1(TAO1) nor by the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) blocker, CFTR inh-172. Ace stimulated whole-cell current in Caco-2 cells. However, the apical ICl was attenuated by knockdown of ANO6 (TMEM16F). This impaired phenotype was restored by re-expression of ANO6 in Caco-2 cells. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings of ANO currents in HEK293 cells transiently expressing mouse ANO1-mCherry or ANO6-GFP confirmed that Ace induced Cl(-) secretion. Application of Ace produced ANO6 but not the ANO1 currents. Ace was not able to induce a [Ca(2+)]i rise in Caco-2 cells, but cellular abundance of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) increased. Identification of the PIP2-binding motif at the N-terminal sequence among human and mouse ANO6 variants along with binding of PIP2 directly to ANO6 in HEK293 cells indicate likely PIP2 regulation of ANO6. The biophysical and pharmacological properties of Ace stimulated Cl(-) current along with intestinal fluid accumulation, and binding of PIP2 to the proximal KR motif of channel proteins, whose mutagenesis correlates with altered binding of PIP2, is comparable with ANO6 stimulation. We conclude that ANO6 is predominantly expressed in intestinal epithelia, where it contributes secretory diarrhea by Ace stimulation in a calcium-independent mechanism of RhoA-ROCK-PIP2 signaling.",

    "129": "Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the leading cause of ESRD worldwide. Reduced bioavailability or uncoupling of nitric oxide in the kidney, leading to decreased intracellular levels of the nitric oxide pathway effector molecule cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), has been implicated in the progression of DN. Preclinical studies suggest that elevating the cGMP intracellular pool through inhibition of the cGMP-hydrolyzing enzyme phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) might exert renoprotective effects in DN. To test this hypothesis, the novel, highly specific, and long-acting PDE5 inhibitor, PF-00489791, was assessed in a multinational, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial of subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus and overt nephropathy receiving angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker background therapy. In total, 256 subjects with an eGFR between 25 and 60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) and macroalbuminuria defined by a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio >300 mg/g, were randomly assigned 3:1, respectively, to receive PF-00489791 (20 mg) or placebo orally, once daily for 12 weeks. Using the predefined primary assessment of efficacy (Bayesian analysis with informative prior), we observed a significant reduction in urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio of 15.7% (ratio 0.843; 95% credible interval 0.73 to 0.98) in response to the 12-week treatment with PF-00489791 compared with placebo. PF-00489791 was safe and generally well tolerated in this patient population. Most common adverse events were mild in severity and included headache and upper gastrointestinal events. In conclusion, the safety and efficacy profile of PDE5 inhibitor PF-00489791 supports further investigation as a novel therapy to improve renal outcomes in DN.",

The SMILE-2 showed that both zofenopril and lisinopril are safe and showed no significant differences in the incidence of major cardiovascular (CV) complications. In this pooled analysis of individual data of the SMILE studies, we evaluated whether the superior efficacy of zofenopril is maintained also in patients with \u22651 CV risk factor (CV+, n = 2962) as compared to CV- (n = 668). The primary study end point was set to 1-year combined occurrence of death or hospitalization for CV causes. The risk of CV events was significantly reduced with zofenopril versus placebo either in the CV+ (-37%; hazard ratio: 0.63; 95% confidence interval: 0.51-0.78; P = 0.0001) or in the CV- group (-55%; hazard ratio: 0.45; 0.26-0.78; P = 0.004). Also, the other angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors reduced the risk of major CV outcomes, though the reduction was not statistically significant versus placebo (CV+: 0.78; 0.58-1.05; P = 0.107; CV-: 0.71; 0.36-1.41; P = 0.334).

Strict volume control via sodium restriction and probing of dry weight are first-line approaches for the treatment of hypertension in this population; however, antihypertensive drug therapy is often needed to control BP. Few trials compare head-to-head the superiority of one antihypertensive drug class over another with respect to improving BP control or altering cardiovascular outcomes; accordingly, selection of the appropriate antihypertensive regimen should be individualized. To individualize therapy, consideration should be given to intra- and interdialytic pharmacokinetics, effect on cardiovascular reflexes, ability to treat comorbid illnesses, and adverse effect profile. \u03b2-Blockers followed by dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers are our first- and second-line choices for antihypertensive drug use. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers seem to be reasonable third-line choices, because the evidence base to support their use in patients on dialysis is sparse. Add-on therapy with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in specific subgroups of patients on dialysis (i.e., those with severe congestive heart failure) seems to be another promising option in anticipation of the ongoing trials evaluating their efficacy and safety. Adequately powered, multicenter, randomized trials evaluating hard cardiovascular end points are urgently warranted to elucidate the comparative effectiveness of antihypertensive drug classes in patients on dialysis.

    "155": "Angiotensin-(1-5) [Ang-(1-5)], which is a metabolite of Angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)] catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), is a pentapeptide of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). It has been reported that Ang-(1-7) and Ang-(1-9) stimulate the secretion of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) via Mas receptor (Mas R) and Ang II type 2 receptor (AT2R), respectively. However, it still remains unknown whether Ang-(1-5) has a similar function to Ang-(1-7). We investigated the effect of Ang-(1-5) on ANP secretion and to define its signaling pathway using isolated perfused beating rat atria. Ang-(1-5) (0.3, 3, 10\u03bcM) stimulated high pacing frequency-induced ANP secretion in a dose-dependent manner. Ang-(1-5)-induced ANP secretion (3\u03bcM) was attenuated by the pretreatment with an antagonist of Mas R (A-779) but not by an antagonist of AT1R (losartan) or AT2R (PD123,319). An inhibitor for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K; wortmannin), protein kinase B (Akt; API-2), or nitric oxide synthase (NOS; L-NAME) also attenuated the augmentation of ANP secretion induced by Ang-(1-5). Ang-(1-5)-induced ANP secretion was markedly attenuated in isoproterenol-treated hypertrophied atria. The secretagogue effect of Ang-(1-5) on ANP secretion was similar to those induced by Ang-(1-9) and Ang-(1-7). These results suggest that Ang-(1-5) is an active mediator of renin-angiotensin system to stimulate ANP secretion via Mas R and PI3K-Akt-NOS pathway.", 
    "156": "We hypothesized that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) might be involved in a complex protective action of ACE inhibitors (ACEi) in anthracyclines-induced cardiomyopathy. For purpose of study, we compared effects of ramipril on cardiac dysfunction, cardiac failure markers and PPAR isoforms in moderate and severe chronic daunorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy. Male Wistar rats were administered with a single intravenous injection of daunorubicin: 5mg/kg (moderate cardiomyopathy), or 15mg/kg (severe cardiomyopathy) or co-administered with daunorubicin and ramipril (1mg/kg/d, orally) or vehicle for 8 weeks. Left ventricular function was measured invasively under anesthesia. Cardiac mRNA levels of heart failure markers (ANP, Myh6, Myh7, Myh7b) and PPARs (alpha, beta/delta and gama) were measured by qRT-PCR. Protein expression of NADPH subunit (gp91phox) was measured by Western blot. Moderate cardiomyopathy exhibited only minor cardiac dysfunction what was corrected by ramipril. In severe cardiomyopathy, hemodynamic dysfunction remained unaltered upon ramipril although it decreased the significantly up-regulated cardiac ANP mRNA expression. Simultaneously, while high-dose daunorubicin significantly decreased PPARbeta/delta and PPARgama mRNA, ramipril normalized these abnormalities. Similarly, ramipril reduced altered levels of oxidative stress-related gp91phox. On the other hand, ramipril was unable to correct both the significantly decreased relative abundance of Myh6 and increased Myh7 mRNA levels, respectively. In conclusion, ramipril had a protective effect on cardiac function exclusively in moderate chronic daunorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy. Although it normalized abnormal PPARs expression and exerted also additional protective effects also in severe cardiomyopathy, it was insufficient to influence impaired cardiac function probably because of a shift in myosin heavy chain isoform content.", 
    "157": "Inflammatory cytokines can induce the expression of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) in endothelial cells. The induction may play an important role in attracting circulating tumor cells (CTCs) to endothelial cells. S-nitrosocaptopril (CapNO) is known to produce vasorelaxation and interfere the hetero-adhesion of CTCs to vascular endothelium via down-regulating the expression of CAMs. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying the inhibition of CapNO on CAMs, in this study, we examined the relationship between cytokines and CAMs expression and investigated the effects of CapNO on cytokine-induced NF-\u043aB and JAK/STAT signal pathways. The activation of CAMs by cytokines was dependent on concentrations and reaction time of cytokines, and the combination of cytokines could produce a strong synergistic effect. IL-1\u03b2 induced the expression of CAMs on endothelial cells by activating NF-\u043aB and JAK/STAT pathways. CapNO inhibited IL-1\u03b2-stimulated NF-\u043aB pathway by down-regulating IKK-\u03b1 and inducing I\u043aB-\u03b1 directly. CapNO also inhibited JAK/STAT pathway by inhibiting JAK2 and STAT3 expressions. These effects bring about down-regulating CAMs expression on endothelial cells. These results suggest that CapNO may interrupt adhesion of cancer cells to endothelium by suppressing CAMs via inhibiting the NF-\u043aB and JAK/STAT pathways in endothelial cells.",

Studies suggest the antihypertensive properties for many bioactive peptides of animal origin with underlying mechanisms ranging from inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme to additional mechanisms to lower blood pressure such as opioid-like activities and mineral-binding and antithrombotic properties. Antihypertensive peptides are the most extensively studied of all the bioactivities induced by food protein hydrolysates, highlighting their importance in human health and disease prevention and treatment. There exist enormous opportunities for the production of novel peptide-based products in biopharmaceutical manufacturing industries for the treatment, prevention, and mitigation of hypertension. Numerous products have already struck on the global market and many more are in process. This article focuses on antihypertensive peptides identified in the meat, fish, blood, milk, dairy products, and egg and their probable application as novel ingredients in the development of functional food products as dietary treatment of hypertension.",

The 35,824 patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and 108,665 patients with heart failure (HF) were admitted to hospitals. Increased hospital case volume was associated with reduced in-hospital mortality rates for both AMI and HF (P for trend <0.001). Although there was little variation among AMI patients in terms of aspirin use at discharge (median prescription rate, 83.0%; interquartile range [IQR], 76.9-88.0%), there were wide variations in the proportions of patients prescribed \u03b2-blockers (BB) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI)/angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARB) at discharge (BB, 41.4%, IQR 27.6-55.7%; ACEI/ARB, 52.0%, IQR 40.3-62.3%). In patients with HF, there were between-hospital variations in medications at discharge (BB, 38.1%, IQR, 27.8-47.6%; ACEI/ARB, 41.0%, IQR 31.7-49.1%).",

    "161": "Hypertension, the most common preventable risk factor for cardiovascular disease and death, is a growing health burden. Serious cardiovascular complications result from target organ damage including cerebrovascular disease, heart failure, ischaemic heart disease and renal failure. While many systems contribute to blood pressure (BP) elevation, the vascular system is particularly important because vascular dysfunction is a cause and consequence of hypertension. Hypertension is characterised by a vascular phenotype of endothelial dysfunction, arterial remodelling, vascular inflammation and increased stiffness. Antihypertensive drugs that influence vascular changes associated with high BP have greater efficacy for reducing cardiovascular risk than drugs that reduce BP, but have little or no effect on the adverse vascular phenotype. Angiotensin converting enzyme ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin\u00a0II receptor blockers (ARBs) improve endothelial function and prevent vascular remodelling. Calcium channel blockers also improve endothelial function, although to a lesser extent than ACEIs and ARBs. Mineralocorticoid receptor blockers improve endothelial function and reduce arterial stiffness, and have recently become more established as antihypertensive drugs. Lifestyle factors are essential in preventing the adverse vascular changes associated with high BP and reducing associated cardiovascular risk. Clinicians and scientists should incorporate these factors into treatment decisions for patients with high BP, as well as in the development of new antihypertensive drugs that promote vascular health.", 
    "162": "The brand new 2016 ESC guidelines for the treatment of acute and chronic heart failure continue to give a prominent place to mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in the treatment of chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). In the prevention of HF hospitalization and death, a class I, level of recommendation A, is given to MRAs for patients with HFrEF, who remain symptomatic despite treatment with an ACE-inhibitor and a beta-blocker and have an LVEF below 35\u00a0%. This recommendation is primarily based on two landmark trials, the RALES trial (for spironolactone) and the EMPHASIS-HF trial (for eplerenone). A crucial question is, however, why MRAs are advised only in \"third place,\" i.e., after optimal up-titration of ACE-inhibitors and beta-blockers. We wonder whether MRAs could not or should not be given earlier in the treatment of HFrEF, namely before or together with the up-titration of ACE-inhibitors and beta-blockers. Several arguments to support this plea are described in this short paper.", 
    "163": "We present a dendrimer-based hybrid formulation strategy to explore the potential of poly (amidoamine) PAMAM dendrimers to be used as drug carriers for combination therapy of an anti-hypertensive drug ramipril (RAPL) and a diuretic hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). The drug-dendrimer complexes were prepared by phase-equilibration method. The results showed that the solubility of RAPL and HCTZ was dependent on dendrimer concentration and pH of dendrimer solution. The solubility profile of both RAPL and HCTZ dendrimer complexes illustrated a non-linear relationship with dendrimer concentration. At 0.8% (w/v) dendrimer concentration, solubility of RAPL was increased 4.91 folds with amine-terminated while for HCTZ, solubility enhancement was highest (3.72 folds) with carboxy-terminated. The complexes were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance analysis and high performance liquid chromatography. In-vitro drug dissolution performance of pure drugs, individual drug loaded dendrimer formulations and hybrid formulations was studied in USP dissolution medium (pH7.0) and in simulated gastric fluid (pH1.2). Dendrimer mediated formulations showed faster and complete dissolution compared to pure RAPL or HCTZ. Surprisingly, similar pattern of dissolution profile was established with hybrid formulations as compared to individual drug loaded dendrimers. The dendrimer-based hybrid formulations were found to be stable at dark and refrigerated conditions up to 5weeks. Conclusively, the proposed formulation strategy establishes a novel multitasking platform using dendrimer for simultaneous loading and delivery of multiple drugs for pharmaceutical applications.",

We sought to examine the prescribing patterns of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), \u03b2-blockers (BBs) and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), and to quantify the estimated 'treatment gap' among HFREF patients in the 'real-world' setting. The MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL and CENTRAL databases were searched for registry- or survey-based studies which examined the prescribing rates of ACE inhibitors, ARBs, BBs and MRAs among HFREF patients. Searches were limited to those published in the years 2000-2015. A total of 23 reports, including 83,605 patients, were evaluated. Overall, ACE inhibitors/ARBs, BBs and MRAs were prescribed to 79.8, 81.4 and 36.4\u00a0% of patients, respectively. The estimated treatment gaps in the overall population were 13.1\u00a0% for ACE inhibitors/ARBs, 3.9\u00a0% for BBs and 16.8\u00a0% for MRAs.

Prescribing these drugs according to contemporary guidelines was associated with lower mortality risk. Patients who were elderly, female and with comorbidities were less likely to receive optimal treatment as recommended by the guidelines. ACE inhibitors, ARBs, BBs and MRAs are under-prescribed in eligible HFREF patients. Efforts should be made to improve approaches to closing the treatment gap at both systems of care and individual levels.", 
    "168": "Heart failure is a major health problem worldwide and, despite effective therapies, is expected to grow by almost 50\u00a0% over the next 15\u00a0years. Five-year mortality remains high at 50\u00a0% over 5\u00a0years. Because of the economic burden and large impact on quality of life, substantial effort has focused on treatments with multiple medical (beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), aldosterone antagonists, and combination of ARB/neprilysin blockers, ivabradine) and device therapies (ICD, CRT) which have been implemented to reduce disease burden and mortality. However, in the past decade only two new medical therapies and no devices have been approved by the US FDA for the treatment of heart failure. This review highlights the preclinical and clinical literature, and the implantation procedure, related to a relatively new therapeutic device for heart failure; cardiac contractility modulation (CCM). CCM delivers a biphasic high-voltage bipolar signal to the RV septum during the absolute refractory period, eliciting an acute increase in global contractility, and chronically producing a sustained improvement in quality of life, exercise tolerance, and heart failure symptoms. The technology is used commercially in Europe with nearly 3000 patients implanted worldwide. Indications include patients with reduced EF and normal or slightly prolonged QRS duration, thus filling an important therapeutic gap among the 2/3 of patients with heart failure who do not meet criteria for CRT. The mechanism by which CCM provides benefit can be seen at the cellular level where improved calcium handling (phosphorylation of phospholamban, upregulation of SERCA-2A), reversal of the fetal myocyte gene program associated with heart failure, and reverse remodeling are observed. Recent retrospective studies indicate a long-term mortality benefit. A pivotal randomized controlled study is currently being completed in the USA. CCM appears to be an effective, safe technology for the treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.",

Moreover, antioxidant, angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, and hypocholesterolemic properties will be evaluated in hydrolysates obtained from these seeds. Despite some seeds contained amygdalin, all protein isolates were free of this substance. Two different procedures to obtain bioactive peptides from protein isolates were examined: gastrointestinal digestion and processing with Alcalase, Flavourzyme or Thermolysin. Higher antioxidant, ACE inhibitor and hypocholesterolemic activities were observed when proteins were processed with Alcalase, Flavourzyme or Thermolysin.

The experimental results suggested that the intrinsic fluorescence of BSA was quenched by ramipril thought a static quenching mechanism, indicating that the stable ramipril-BSA complex was formed by the intermolecular interaction. The number of binding sites (n) and binding constant of ramipril-BSA complex were about 1 and 3.50\u00d710(4)M(-1) at 298K, respectively, suggesting that there was stronger binding interaction of ramipril with BSA.

Concurrent chronic medications may impact the patient's immune system, possess antimelanoma properties, and potentially affect clinical outcomes. This retrospective study sought to describe the efficacy and toxicity effects of 12 classes of chronic medications in metastatic melanoma patients treated with ipilimumab. A total of 159 adults who received ipilimumab for metastatic melanoma at Mayo Clinic (Rochester, Minnesota, USA) from 1 March 2011 through 31 December 2014 were included. Classes of chronic medications included statins, metformin, \u03b2-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin-receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, aspirin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, H1 and H2 receptor antagonists, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), antidepressants, and vitamin D supplements.

Moreover, depletion of miR-125b significantly blocked reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and apoptosis in high glucose-exposed HK-2 cells. In contrast, ectopic expression of miR-125b accelerated ROS production and apoptotic response in HK-2 cells, which was coupled with induction of Bax and reduction of Bcl-2.

Role of ROS was investigated in rats with temporally impaired principal blood pressure regulation systems using ganglionic blocker pentolinium (P, 5 mg/kg), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (C, 10 mg/kg), nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-NAME (L, 30 mg/kg) and superoxide dismutase mimeticum tempol (T, 25 mg/kg). Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was measured by the carotid artery catheter and inhibitors were administered intravenously. MAP was disturbed by a 3-s air jet, which increased MAP by 35.2+/-3.0 % vs. basal MAP after the first exposure. Air jet increased MAP in captopril- and tempol-treated rats similarly as observed in saline-treated rats. In pentolinium-treated rats stress significantly decreased MAP vs. pre-stress value. In L-NAME-treated rats stress failed to affect MAP significantly. Treatment of rats with P+L+C resulted in stress-induced MAP decrease by 17.3+/-1.3 % vs. pre-stress value and settling time (20.1+/-4.2 s). In P+L+C+T-treated rats stress led to maximal MAP decrease by 26.4+/-2.2 % (p<0.005 vs. P+L+C) and prolongation of settling time to 32.6+/-3.3 s (p<0.05 vs. P+L+C). Area under the MAP curve was significantly smaller in P+L+C-treated rats compared to P+L+C+T-treated ones (167+/-43 vs. 433+/-69 a.u., p<0.008). In conclusion, in rats with temporally impaired blood pressure regulation, the lack of ROS resulted in greater stress-induced MAP alterations and prolongation of time required to reach new post-stress steady state.",

DCM is generally progressive, and some patients with DCM need heart transplant despite optimal medical and mechanical therapy. Current guidelines recommend inhibitors of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, namely angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist as well as beta-blockers for the medical treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, including DCM. Furthermore, because they have beneficial effects on the outcome of heart failure in a dose-related fashion, they should be titrated to the target dose. In clinical practice, the underuse and under-dose of these agents matter; however, the efficacy and safety of supramaximal dose of ACE inhibitor or ARB have never been investigated in the patients with DCM. In this issue of ESC Heart Failure, it is demonstrated that benazepril or valsartan at supramaximal dose improved left ventricular function and reduced cardiovascular events compared with each drug at low dose, respectively.

Among their advantages, these systems offer therapeutic benefits such as dose flexibility and combined drug release patterns. The use of lipids in the formulation has also drawn considerable interest as means to modify the drug release from the dosage form. Therefore, this paper aimed at developing sustained release mini-tablets containing the highly soluble drugs captopril and metformin hydrochloride. Carnauba wax was used as a lipid component in melt granulation, targeting the improvement of the drugs poor flowability and tabletability, as well as to sustain the drug release profiles in association with other excipients. To assist sustaining the drug release, Ethocel\u2122 (EC) and Kollicoat\u00ae SR 30D associated with Opadry\u00ae II were employed as matrix-forming and reservoir-forming materials, respectively. The neat drugs, granules and the bulk formulations were evaluated for their angle of repose, compressibility index, Hausner ratio and tabletability. Mini-tablets were evaluated for their weight variation, hardness, friability, drug content and in-vitro drug release. The results indicated that melt granulation with carnauba wax improved the flow and the tabletability of the drugs, allowing the preparation of mini-tablets with adequate tensile strength under reduced compaction pressures. All mini-tablet formulations showed acceptable hardness (within the range of 1.16 to 3.93Kp) and friability (<0.1%). The melt-granulated captopril in matrix systems containing 50% EC (45P, 100P or 100FP) and the melt-granulated metformin hydrochloride in reservoir systems coated with Kollicoat\u00ae SR 30D and Opadry\u00ae II (80:20 with 10% weight gain or 70:30 with 20% weight gain) exhibited release profiles adequate to sustained release formulations, for over 450min.

Sixteen trials with 104,321 patients and a mean follow-up of 2.9\u00a0years were included. Compared with placebo, ACEIs significantly reduced all outcomes except stroke.

Amongst the investigated fillers in this work, directly compressible lactose, spray-dried lactose and microcrystalline cellulose showed a level of degradation at 135\u00b0C whilst talc and TCP allowed consistent flow of the filament and a successful 3D printing of the tablet. A specially developed universal filament based on pharmaceutically approved methacrylic polymer (Eudragit EPO) and thermally stable filler, TCP (tribasic calcium phosphate) was optimised. Four model drugs with different physicochemical properties were included into ready-to-use mechanically stable tablets with immediate release properties.

    "222": "Bradykinin exerts its vascular actions via two types of receptors, the non-constitutively expressed bradykinin receptor type 1 (BR1) and the constitutive type 2 receptor (BR2). Bradykinin-induced vasorelaxation is age-dependent, a phenomenon related to the varying amounts of BR1 and BR2 in the vasculature. Isoleucine-proline-proline (Ile-Pro-Pro), a bioactive tripeptide, lowers elevated blood pressure and improves impaired endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation in hypertensive rats. It inhibits angiotensin converting enzyme 1 (ACE1). Other mechanisms of action have also been postulated. The aims of the study were to clarify the underlying mechanisms of the age-dependency of bradykinin-induced vasodilatation such as the roles of the two bradykinin receptors, the mas-receptor and synergism with Ile-Pro-Pro. The vascular response studies were conducted using mesenteric artery and aorta rings from normotensive 6 wk. (young) and 22 wk. (old) Wistar rats. Cumulative dosing of acetylcholine, bradykinin and angiotensin(1-7) (Ang(1-7))were tested in phenylephrine-induced vasoconstriction with or without 10min pre-incubation with antagonists against BR1-, BR2- or mas-receptors, Ang(1-7) or ACE1-inhibitors captopril and Ile-Pro-Pro. The bradykinin-induced vasorelaxation in vitro was age-dependent and it was improved by pre-incubation with Ile-Pro-Pro, especially in old rats with endothelial dysfunction. The mas-receptor antagonist, D-Pro7-Ang(1-7) abolished bradykinin-induced relaxation totally. Interestingly, BR1 and BR2 antagonists only slightly reduced bradykinin-induced vasorelaxation, as an evidence for the involvement of other mechanisms in addition to receptor activation. In conclusion, bradykinin-induced vasorelaxation was age-dependent and Ile-Pro-Pro improved it. Mas receptor antagonist abolished relaxation while bradykinin receptor antagonist only slightly reduced it, suggesting that bradykinin-induced vasorelaxation is regulated also by other mechanisms than the classical BR1/BR2 pathway.",

    "224": "The transformation of captopril (CAP), a widely-used thiol drug, was studied with the presence of dissolved model humic constituents (HCs) in a laccase-catalyzed system. Reaction products were analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry and condensed fukui function computation. CAP reacted with different model HCs in the enzymatic system for 1\u00a0h, ranging from 75% (syringic acid) to 96% (p-coumaric acid). In the absence of HCs, only 15% of CAP was removed through self-coupling. The presence of HCs apparently changed the transformation of CAP in aqueous environment, and the HC reactive intermediates played an important role. First, during laccase catalysis, HCs with different structures were oxidized to produce reactive intermediates, including phenoxyl radical cation, ortho-, and para-quinone intermediates. Second, these intermediates were readily attacked by CAP via nucleophilic reactions, forming C-S-C covalent conjugates. More importantly, the standard reduction potential of these intermediates is a critical parameter, as PCA showed the highest reactivity to the nucleophilic addition reaction with CAP by forming phenoxy radical cations. While SYR showed the least reactivity due to the formation of para-quinone intermediates. Therefore, the functional groups on HCs could greatly influence the cross-coupling with CAP, as well as the type and stability of the coupling products. This work clearly demonstrated the transformation of CAP and other thiol drugs with the presence of HCs in aqueous environment, which is similar to the natural humification process.",

Also patients diagnosed using echocardiography at regular intervals showed a lower risk of dying (OR 0.314).", 
    "235": "The results of this large sample could confirm the results of clinical trials that a therapy according to the guidelines has a significant impact on mortality. By analyzing the claims data evidence was found that in the treatment of heart failure patients the medical results could be improved by adherence to guideline recommendations.", 
    "236": "Natriuretic peptides (NPs) promote diuresis, natriuresis and vasodilation in early chronic heart failure (CHF), countering renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and sympathetic nervous system (SNS) overstimulation. Despite dramatic increases in circulating NP concentrations as CHF progresses, their effects become blunted. Increases in diuresis, natriuresis, and vasodilation after administration of exogenous atrial (ANP) or brain (BNP) natriuretic peptides are attenuated in patients with advanced CHF compared with controls. Several major factors may account for the reduced effectiveness of the natriuretic peptide system (NPS) in CHF. First, there is reduced availability of active forms of NPs, namely BNP. Second, target organ responsiveness becomes diminished. Third, the counter-regulatory hormones of the RAAS and SNS, and endothelin-1 become over-activated. Therefore, pharmacological approaches to enhance the functional effectiveness of the NPS in CHF have been explored in recent years. In terms of clinical outcomes, studies of synthetic BNP, or of neprilysin inhibitors alone or associated with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, have been controversial for several reasons. Recently, however, encouraging results have been obtained with the angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor sacubitril/valsartan. The available data show that treatment with sacubitril/valsartan is associated with increased levels of NPs and their intracellular mediator cyclic guanosine monophosphate, suggesting improved functional effectiveness of the NPS, in addition to beneficial effects on mortality and morbidity outcomes. Therefore, combined targeting of the NPS and RAAS with sacubitril/valsartan emerges as the current optimal approach for redressing the neurohormonal imbalance in CHF.", 
    "237": "Aristolochic acid nephropathy (AAN) is a progressive kidney disease caused by a Chinese herb containing aristolochic acid. Excessive death of renal tubular epithelial cells (RTECs) characterized the acute phase of AAN. Therapies for acute AAN were limited, such as steroids and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs)/angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs). It was interesting that, in acute AAN, female patients showed relative slower progression to renal failure than males. In a previous study, female hormone 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2) was found to attenuate renal ischemia-reperfusion injury. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the potential protective role of E2 in acute AAN. Compared with male C57BL/6 mice of acute AAN, lower serum creatinine (SCr) and less renal injury, together with RTEC apoptosis in females, were found. Treatment with E2 in male AAN mice reduced SCr levels and attenuated renal tubular injury and RTEC apoptosis. In the mice kidney tissue and human renal proximal tubule cells (HK-2 cells), E2 both attenuated AA-induced cell apoptosis and downregulated the expression of phosphor-p53 (Ser15), p53, and cleaved-caspase-3. This study highlights that E2 exhibited protective effects on the renal injury of acute AAN in male mice by reducing RTEC apoptosis, which might be related to inhibiting the p53 signaling pathway.",

AD spectrum consists of presymptomatic, early symptomatic, and symptomatic phase of dementia. At present, no pharmacotherapy exists to modify or reverse a course of AD, and only symptomatic treatments are available. Many elderly patients, diagnosed with multiple medical conditions (such as cardiovascular diseases, Type 2 diabetes mellitus, and cerebrovascular diseases) are at increased risk of the development of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), AD, and vascular dementia. Studies have revealed reduced rates of cognitive decline, in elderly patients, who were treated with centrally active angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) (that have an ability to cross the blood-brain barrier). This article reviews recently published literature, focused on possible protective influence of the centrally active ACE-Is, in the elderly population, at risk for cognitive decline.",

    "253": "Cardiovascular diseases as atherosclerosis are associated to an inflammatory state of the vessel wall which is accompanied by endothelial dysfunction, and adherence and activation of circulating inflammatory cells. Hydrogen sulfide, a novel cardiovascular protective gaseous mediator, has been reported to exert anti-inflammatory activity. We have recently demonstrated that the SH containing ACE inhibitor zofenoprilat, the active metabolite of zofenopril, controls the angiogenic features of vascular endothelium through H2S enzymatic production by cystathionine gamma lyase (CSE). Based on H2S donor/generator property of zofenoprilat, the objective of this study was to evaluate whether zofenoprilat exerts anti-inflammatory activity in vascular cells through its ability to increase H2S availability. Here we found that zofenoprilat, in a CSE/H2S-mediated manner, abolished all the inflammatory features induced by interlukin-1beta (IL-1\u03b2) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), especially the NF-\u03baB/cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)/prostanoid biochemical pathway. The pre-incubation with zofenoprilat/CSE dependent H2S prevented IL-1\u03b2 induced paracellular hyperpermeability through the control of expression and localization of cell-cell junctional markers ZO-1 and VE-cadherin. Moreover, zofenoprilat/CSE dependent H2S reduced the expression of the endothelial markers CD40 and CD31, involved in the recruitment of circulating mononuclear cells and platelets. Interestingly, this anti-inflammatory activity was also confirmed in vascular smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts as zofenoprilat reduced, in both cell lines, proliferation, migration and COX-2 expression induced by IL-1\u03b2, but independently from the SH moiety and H2S availability. These in vitro data document the anti-inflammatory activity of zofenoprilat on vascular cells, reinforcing the cardiovascular protective effect of this multitasking drug.",

This study was designed to assess the effect of 17-\u03b2 estradiol (E2) treatment and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), captopril, on osteoporosis induced by ovariectomy in rats and discussing the role of OPG/RANKL ratio in their action. Thirty two adult female rats were divided into four equal groups. Group I: control group, Group II: ovariectomized (OVX) non treated group, Group III: OVX rats treated with E2, Group IV: OVX rats treated with captopril. OVX rats showed a significant decrease in serum Ca2+ and OPG levels with significant increase in serum RANKL, osteocalcin, alkaline phosphatase activity and urinary hydroxyproline levels. Treatment with captopril as well as E2 led to a significant improvement in bone markers levels with a significant increase in OPG/RANKL ratio. Image analysis technique revealed that there was a significant improvement in cortical bone thickness (CBT) and mean trabecular bone density (TBD) in OVX rats treated with either E2 or ACEI. So, we can conclude that the protective effect of E2 and ACEI on osteoporosis may be mediated by influencing OPG/RANKL signaling.",

Propensity score (PS) analysis is widely used in aging research to reduce confounding. Understanding the assumptions and pitfalls of common PS analysis methods is fundamental to applying and interpreting PS analysis. This review was developed based on a symposium of the American Geriatrics Society Annual Meeting on the use and interpretation of PS analysis in May 2014. PS analysis involves two steps: estimation of PS and estimation of the treatment effect using PS. Typically estimated from a logistic model, PS reflects the probability of receiving a treatment given observed characteristics of an individual. PS can be viewed as a summary score that contains information on multiple confounders and is used in matching, weighting, or stratification to achieve confounder balance between the treatment groups to estimate the treatment effect. Of these methods, matching and weighting generally reduce confounding more effectively than stratification. Although PS is often included as a covariate in the outcome regression model, this is no longer a best practice because of its sensitivity to modeling assumption. None of these methods reduce confounding by unmeasured variables. The rationale, best practices, and caveats in conducting PS analysis are explained in this review using a case study that examined the effective of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors on mortality and hospitalization in older adults with heart failure.", 
    "258": "The heart and the kidneys are the most commonly involved organs in systemic amyloidosis. Cardiac involvement is associated with an increased morbidity, treatment intolerance, and poorer overall survival. The most common types of amyloidosis that are associated with cardiac involvement include light chain (AL) amyloidosis and transthyretin (TTR) amyloidosis (both mutant and wild type). The traditional first-line treatment for AL amyloidosis includes alkylator-based chemotherapy or high-dose melphalan followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Novel agents, including proteasome inhibitors, immunomodulators, and monoclonal antibodies, have shown promising activity in both frontline and relapsed settings. Orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT) followed by ASCT has led to superior outcomes compared to OHT alone. Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is the first-line treatment for TTR amyloidosis. However, progression of cardiac amyloidosis after OLT is often noted due to deposition of wild TTR. Combined OLT and OHT also has a role in treatment and leads to superior outcomes in carefully selected candidates. Pharmacologic agents, including diflunisal, tafamidis, small interfering ribonucleic acid, and doxycycline, have shown promising activity in stabilizing TTR from misfolding into fibrils and are being actively investigated. Best supportive care and management of heart failure symptoms with diuretics are a mainstay of treatment in all cardiac amyloidosis subtypes.

Areas covered: Angiotensin II (Ang II) as the major effector peptide of the RAS is a pro-oxidant and fibrogenic cytokine. Mechanistically, NADPH oxidase (NOX) is a multicomponent enzyme complex that is able to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) as a downstream signaling pathway of Ang II which is expressed in liver. Ang II has a detrimental role in the pathogenesis of chronic liver disease through possessing pro-oxidant, fibrogenic, and pro-inflammatory impact in the liver. The alternative axis (ACE2/Ang(1-7)/mas) of the RAS serves as an anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-fibrotic component of the RAS.

Extensive efforts have been devoted to identifying and testing strategies to achieve this end, but little consensus has been reached on a common and shared operability.Timing, dose and mode of chemotherapy administration play a crucial role in the development of acute or late myocardial dysfunction. Primary prevention initiatives cover a wide area that ranges from conventional heart failure drugs, such as \u03b2-blockers and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system antagonists to nutritional supplementation and physical training. Additional studies on the pathophysiology and cellular mechanisms of anticancer-drug-related CTX will enable the introduction of novel therapies.We present various typologies of prevention strategies, describing the approaches that have already been used and those that could be effective on the basis of a better understanding of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic CTX mechanisms.",

PA screening involves measuring the aldosterone-to-renin-ratio (ARR), but false negative results can occur in the setting of medications, which block the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Withdrawing RAS blockers from patients with resistant hypertension is not without cardiovascular risk. A novel diagnostic approach, the aldosterone-to-angiotensin-II-ratio (AA2-Ratio), has the potential for less drug interference and improved reliability in PA screening and confirmation of diagnosis.",

Sampling was performed in a recumbent (7 a.m.) and in an upright (10 a.m.) position before and after 4 days of oral administration of fludrocortisone and salt loading. The concentrations of renin, aldosterone and equilibrium Angiotensin-II were determined and ARR and AA2-Ratios were calculated. The interference of ACE-inhibition with the AA2-Ratio was investigated in healthy volunteers receiving 10\u200amg enalapril daily for 8 days.",

Angiotensin-II levels were significantly higher in upright collected samples compared to samples collected in a recumbent position. Comparison of the ARR with the AA2-Ratio revealed a significantly larger diagnostic window for the AA2-Ratio. While the ARR was significantly suppressed by ACE-inhibitor treatment, the AA2-Ratio remained unaffected by ACE-inhibition.",

Equilibrium Angiotensin-II levels show expected responses to posture and appear to outperform renin concentration as a marker for RAS activation in terms of sensitivity, giving a measurable readout even in clinical states characterized by markedly suppressed RAS activity. The stability of the AA2-Ratio in the presence of ACE-inhibition points to a potential use of the AA2-Ratio PA screening in hypertensive patients without ACE-inhibitor discontinuation.", 
    "271": "Primary aldosteronism (PA) is severe form of hypertension characterized by a strongly increased aldosterone secretion mediated by adenomas or other forms of adrenal hyper-activity. Once detected, PA can be usually cured by either surgical intervention or by appropriate pharmacologic treatments. The incidence of PA among hypertensive patients varies strongly between different studies, which is in part caused by the complex state-of-the-art testing procedure that is unfortunately far away from being a versatile PA screening tool. Despite strong limitations regarding selectivity and the interference with multiple anti-hypertensive drugs, the antibody-based determination of the aldosterone-renin-ratio (ARR) is widely used in the diagnostic process of PA. However, there is still a strong demand for accurate, reliable and patient friendly PA case detection. The implementation of novel LC-MS/MS based assays for quantification of aldosterone might help to improve the power of the ARR as a diagnostic tool for PA. However, there is a big need for a versatile PA screening test that doesn't interfere with anti-hypertensive treatments and therefore allows the clear identification of PA patients without complex and risky treatment adaptions being necessary in the course of the diagnostic process.The Aldosterone-to-Angiotensin-II-Ratio (AA2-Ratio) is a novel LC-MS/MS based high-throughput test for PA that combines the molar plasma levels of aldosterone and physiologically active angiotensin II into a single dimension-free diagnostic value. The availability of innovative diagnostic approaches for biochemical analysis of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone-System paved the way for Angiotensin peptides to be used in clinical routine testing by overcoming pre-analytic issues regarding analyte stability. In addition to overall RAS activity and aldosterone levels, the AA2-Ratio integrates the activity of all plasma enzymes involved in angiotensin II metabolism and accurately estimates of the portion of physiologically active angiotensin II in a patient sample. The performance of the AA2-Ratio is superior to the ARR in terms of the diagnostic window, which can be explained by the much closer functional link between aldosterone and angiotensin II comparing to the molecular distant relationship between aldosterone and renin. It has been shown that the correlation between renin concentration or activity and angiotensin II is poor especially in patients treated with anti-hypertensive drugs. In sharp contrast, the AA2-Ratio does not interfere with first line anti-hypertensive drugs including ACE inhibitors.The AA2-Ratio has the potential to be superior to the ARR in terms of its ability to better reflecting the activity of the true direct circulating regulator of aldosterone (i.e. angiotensin II rather than renin), and being unaffected by antihypertensive medications including ACE inhibitors. Data obtained in proof-of-concept studies proved the AA2-Ratio to be a powerful and cost-effective diagnostic tool for the diagnosis of PA among hypertensive patients. The stability of the AA2-Ratio in the presence of ACE-inhibition points to a potential use of the AA2-Ratio PA screening in hypertensive patients without ACE-inhibitor discontinuation.", 
    "272": "Heart failure (HF) represents a significant healthcare issue because of its ever-increasing prevalence, poor prognosis and complex pathophysiology. The cornerstone of modern drug therapy in chronic HF is the inhibition of neurohormonal activation that plays a crucial role in the pathophysiology of HF development and progression and, more specifically, of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and the sympathetic nervous system. LCZ696 is a first-in-class, angiotensin receptor NEP inhibitor (ARNI) that consists of a supramolecular complex of a molecule of the ARB valsartan in combination with a molecule of the NEP inhibitor prodrug AHU377 (also known as sacubitril). The recently published 'Prospective comparison of Angiotensin Receptor neprilysin inhibitors with Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors to Determine Impact on Global Mortality and morbidity in Heart Failure' (PARADIGM-HF) trial applied an innovative approach to the introduction of new HF therapies. Instead of adding the new agent on top of standard care, an approach followed by the majority of previous HF clinical trials, PARADIGM-HF proposed the substitution of one of the cornerstones of modern HF therapy, the ACEi. The results reported by the PARADIGM-HF trial investigators are indeed impressive and introduce a paradigm shift in the treatment of chronic HFrEF. Although long-term data remain to be generated, the promising results are likely to expedite acceptance of the drug for HF-REF.", 
    "273": "The burden of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in general and heart failure (HF) in particular continues to increase worldwide. CVD are major contributors to death and morbidity and recognized as important drivers of healthcare expenditure. Chronic overactivity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays a key role in human hypertension and HF pathophysiology. RAAS is fundamental in the overall regulation of cardiovascular homeostasis through the actions of hormones, which regulate vascular tone, and specifically blood pressure through vasoconstriction and renal sodium and water retention. Drugs inhibiting key components of the RAAS have become a cornerstone of contemporary cardiovascular drug therapy. Nowadays there is a high priority for the development of innovative therapeutic agents that better control blood pressure, have a therapeutic potential in HF and enhance current therapies for CVD. The enhancement of the biological activities of the natriuretic peptides (NP) via inhibition of their degradation is one of the novel strategies.Natriuretic peptide system includes primarily three well-characterized peptides with structural similarity: atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP). These three peptides are involved in the maintenance of cardio-renal homeostasis and all have cardio-renal protective properties. Atrial natriuretic peptide and BNP are synthetized mainly by the cardiomyocytes in response to cardiac stretch, whereas CNP is mainly produced by endothelial cells in response to cytokines and endothelium-dependent agonists. B-type natriuretic peptide is also produced by cardiofibroblasts where it elicits its antifibrotic actions in the heart. All NP function via the second messenger cGMP. All three peptides are cleared by the clearance receptor (NPR-C), not linked to a guanylate cyclase. The NP are also cleared from the circulation via enzymatic degradation by neutral endopeptidase (NEP). Natriuretic peptides play key role in the regulation of electrolytes and water balance homeostasis, blood pressure levels through diuretic, natriuretic, vasorelaxant effects, along with the ability to inhibit the RAAS and the sympathetic nervous system. They modulate systemic vascular resistance by inhibiting the contraction of vascular smooth muscle cells through cGMP-dependent kinases. Apart from increased volume overload and myocytes stress hormonal stimuli are involved in the control of NP release.Besides hemodynamic functions, new properties of NP have been recently discovered related to the interaction with cellular growth and proliferation at the vascular level. Natriuretic peptides preserve vascular health in endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells by interfering with the key mechanisms of atherosclerosis (proliferation, angiogenesis, apoptosis, and inflammation). Natriuretic peptides exert antihypertrophic and antifibrotic actions within the heart.There is a growing body of evidence that dysregulation of the NP system exists in CVD. Hypertension and HF are considered as NP deficiency state. During the evolution of HF the heart increases its production and release of ANP and BNP in order to compensate the increased water retention. Elevated circulating levels of such hormones have been associated with worsening of HF and poor prognosis. Recent studies have reported that in patients with congestive HF and high plasma BNP levels there is actually a lack of mature BNP. Studies have confirmed that altered processing of BNP occurs in HF and hence a relative deficiency of this protective hormone. The presence of shorter, less biologically active precursors and multiple degraded forms of BNP was also demonstrated. These data explain the blunting of the expected physiological responses to apparently high levels of BNP. Patients with advanced HF may actually be in a state of NP deficiency.Similar to HF, patients with essential hypertension may also have NP deficiency state. Studies suggested that a deficiency of bioactive BNP may be present in the early stages of hypertension thus favoring its progression. It was revealed that BNP system was not activated and ANP system was lower in pre-hypertensives than in normotensive subjects. Altered processing pathway of pro-BNP to mature BNP also occurs in hypertension. This impaired processing of the NP may result in reduced blood pressure-lowering effects of NP and leads to hypertension progression, more severe CVD and overt HF. Besides single-nucleotide polymorphisms of the ANP and BNP gene as well as the NP clearance receptor have been identified.In summary there is the existence of a deficiency state of biologically active cardiac NP in hypertension and HF. As a result of their cardiovascular properties NP are currently viewed as active players in the process of cardiovascular remodeling and in the natural history of hypertension and HF. Manipulation of this system is a logical pursuit and represents a new therapeutic opportunity for CVD. Current NP-augmenting strategies include the design of a number of synthetic NP and inhibition of neprilysin.A key component of the NP system is the NEP (neprilysin). This membrane-bound metallopeptidase is widely expressed, but is most abundant in the kidney. Neprilysin serves as the principal mechanism for enzymatic removal of the native NPs with susceptibility to degradation greatest for CNP>ANP>BNP. Importantly, many other substrates for neprilysin exist, some of them with opposing physiological actions. These include endothelin-1, kinin peptides, opioid peptides, substance P, amyloid beta protein, gastrin. Neprilysin also hydrolyzes angiotensin-I to angiotensin-(1-7). Inhibition of NEP (NEPi) has been advanced as a potential therapeutic modality. NEP inhibition alone leads to an increase in circulating levels of both vasodilators as well as vasoconstrictors. Neutral endopeptidase's ability to degrade multiple substrates means that the sole NEPi yields broader effects than anticipated and explains why NEPi is best combined with the inhibition of other vasoactive compounds. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) do not disrupt bradykinin metabolism as much as ACE-inhibitors, and some patients with ACE-inhibitor-associated angioedema can be switched over to an ARB without the occurrence of angioedema. A novel class of drugs that combines the actions of NEP inhibitors and ARB, known as angiotensin receptor blockade with neutral endopeptidase inhibition (ARNi) was developed. LCZ696 is the first compound of this category. Novel ARNi-based therapeutic strategies are expected contribute to optimize control of CVD and of their outcomes.", 
    "274": "Blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) can be accomplished at the level of the angiotensin-generating enzymes renin and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE; using renin inhibitors or ACE inhibitors), the type 1 angiotensin II (AT1) receptor or mineralocorticoid receptor (MR; using angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs] or MR blockers) and/or renin release (using beta-blockers). Several of these drugs are often combined-for example in heart failure-but such approaches may ultimately lead to RAAS annihilation with adverse consequences such as hypotension, renal dysfunction and hyperkalaemia. The biochemical consequences of each type of blockade are different. For instance, ACE inhibitors will lower angiotensin II, thus no longer allowing stimulation of both AT1 and type 2 angiotensin II (AT2) receptors, while ARBs raise angiotensin II, allowing selective stimulation of the unoccupied AT2 receptor. This might be of particular importance in women, in whom the protective AT2 receptor pathway is believed to be upregulated. Multiple clinical trials have compared the various types of RAAS blockers and/or their combination. This talk will summarize the current evidence with regard to similarities and differences between ACE inhibitors and ARBs, also considering their side-effect profile, dose and combination with other RAAS blockers.", 
    "275": "Heart disease, stroke, and kidney failure are leading causes of death worldwide, and hypertension is a significant risk factor for each. Hypertension is less common in women, compared to men, in those younger than 45 years of age. This trend is reversed in those 65 years and older. In the US between 2011-2014, the prevalence of hypertension in women and men by age group was 6% vs 8% (18-39 years), 30% vs 35% (40-59 years), and 67% vs 63% (60 years and over). Awareness, treatment, and control rates differ between genders with women being more aware of their diagnosis (85% vs 80%), more likely to take their medications (81% vs 71%) and more frequently having controlled hypertension (55% vs 49%). Analysis of >12,000 patient visits with primary care physicians in the US showed no gender difference in the number of anti-hypertensive medications, but did reveal women were more commonly prescribed diuretics and less frequently prescribed ACE-inhibitors.Data on blood pressure (BP) and hypertension prevalence have traditionally been based on manual/automated sphygmomanometer measurements in office. However, extensive epidemiologic data indicate that up to 30% of persons diagnosed with hypertension in office are normotensive outside of clinic. Multiple large population based meta-analyses have shown the superiority of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) and home BP monitoring (or self-monitoring) to in-clinic BP measurements in predicting cardiovascular outcomes (cardiovascular death, stroke, and cardiac/coronary events). Further, night-time BP recorded by ABPM has emerged as a better predictor of total mortality, stroke, and cardiovascular death in patients with hypertension and a history cardiovascular disease (CVD) than either day-time ABPM or in-clinic BP measurements. Importantly, the United States Preventive Services Task Force is now recommending ABPM in all patients prior to initiation of anti-hypertensive treatment as a Grade-A recommendation. ABPM data show a higher percentage of women (43%) than men (34%) have white coat hypertension (elevated in clinic BP, normal out of clinic BP). White coat hypertension has been associated with development of sustained hypertension and increased stroke risk on long term follow-up. In contrast, masked hypertension (elevated out of clinic BP, normal in clinic BP), which has been associated with increased cardiovascular risk, is less common in women compared to men. The prevalence of masked hypertension in women increases with body mass index (adjusted OR\u200a=\u200a1.65 for BMI\u226527, 95% CI\u200a=\u200a1.14-2.39) and alcohol intake (adjusted OR\u200a=\u200a2.12 for at least six drinks per week, 95% CI\u200a=\u200a1.34-3.35), perhaps accounting for the increased rate of cardiovascular outcomes in this patient group.Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with CVD outcomes have provided definitive evidence that BP lowering medications benefit hypertensive women. While these trials have largely shown similar CVD outcome benefits in both genders, some differences in response to therapy have been reported. In the ALLHAT study, amlodipine, compared to lisinopril, was associated with a greater reduction in BP, as well as a decreased stroke rate in women. In the VALUE study, cardiovascular morbidity/mortality was higher with valsartan than with amlodipine in women. In the LIFE study, a lower primary composite endpoint (CVD death, stroke, and myocardial infarction) was seen in women treated with losartan. The BP Lowering Treatment Trialists' Collaboration overview of 31 RCTs included comparisons of active agents with placebos, intensive vs less intensive anti-hypertensive medications, and one active agent versus another. In all cases, average baseline BP was higher for women than men, but BP reduction was comparable between genders. No differences in the effects of various anti-hypertensive regimens on CVD outcomes by gender were identified. However, clinically significant gender specific adverse effects of various anti-hypertensive drug classes have been identified. Women more commonly develop hyponatremia/hypokalemia from diuretic therapy; men more frequently develop gout. Women are 3 times more likely to develop an ACE-inhibitor related cough, and more commonly experience CCB-related peripheral edema and minoxidil-induced hirsutism. Importantly, ACEIs/ARBs, direct renin inhibitors, and mineralocorticoid antagonists are contraindicated in women of reproductive age due to the potential of developing fetal abnormalities. Thiazide type diuretics are preferred for the use in elderly women because of decreased risk of hip fractures.Several forms of hypertension, including post-menopausal, oral contraceptive (OCP) induced, and pregnancy related hypertension occur only in women. Following menopause, there is an age independent increase in systolic BP thought to be secondary to the withdrawal of endogenous estrogen, increased salt sensitivity, diminished endothelial nitric oxide production, and increased angiotensin II receptor expression. OCP use is associated with increases in both BP and risk of cardiovascular events, which are reversible with cessation of OCP use. Hypertension in pregnancy (including chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, and eclampsia) is associated with increased maternal and fetal cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular risk during pregnancy and long-term mortality risk, particularly for Alzheimer disease, stroke, diabetes, and ischemic heart disease.", 
    "276": "There is a whole armament of good drugs for treatment of hypertension including diuretics, calcium antagonist, angiotensin receptor antagonists and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Secondary drugs mostly used for special indications include beta-blockers, alpha-blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (aldosterone antagonists), renin-inhibitors, centrally acting drugs, direct vasodilators and others.A variety of new drugs targeting different pressor mechanism exist and have partly been studies experimentally but will unlikely make it to clinical use in human hypertension. The reason for this is mainly the fact that all existing drugs are generic and inexpensive. The clinical development of new drugs has thus halted because industry does not get paid back for their investments. A recent example is the angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor which has success in the treatment of heart failure at least partly because of powerful blood pressure lowering properties. However, one may also wonder whether potential harmful effects from long term treatment such as deposition of beta-amyloid in the brain may influence the risk of Alzheimer and prohibit development for use in hypertension.Against the solid documentation of today's first line drugs on preventing the cardiovascular complications of hypertension potential new drugs on the market would need to be tested in mega-trials before likely to be successful. Even if proven effective the cost issue would remain as a major barrier.Thus, the future development of drug therapy for hypertension would be improving the clinical aspects including overcoming clinical inertia and adherence to the drugs. In other words education of physicians and patients to make the right choices and follow-up on treatment that has been initiated. Targets are always the same - patients with well controlled blood pressure and without side effects. Adherence may be facilitated with drug monitoring in blood and urine, and combinations of complimentary drugs - usually given once daily and in the same pill. People with uncontrolled hypertension should be detected and treated to target blood pressure <140/90 mmHg, rather rapidly in high risk people, and then maintained with controlled BP <140/90 mmHg.", 
    "277": "The 'legacy effect' of hypertension treatment is where short term treatment with blood pressure (BP) lowering drugs such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) is followed by a persistent reduction in BP, reduced cardiovascular complications and increased lifespan. However, the involvement of epigenetics mechanisms remains unclear. DNA methylation is the binding of a methyl group to DNA which inhibits gene transcription. The aim of this study is to investigate DNA methylation changes after short term treatment with ACEi.", 
    "278": "Spontaneously hypertensive rats were treated with the ACEi perindopril for 48\u200ahours at 6 weeks old. Average global DNA methylation was quantified in renal cortices from perindopril (n\u200a=\u200a6) and vehicle-treated animals (n\u200a=\u200a6) using the 5-mC ELISA Kit (Zymo Research, USA) which features a unique anti-5-methylcytosine monoclonal antibody that is both sensitive and specific for 5-mC. We also measured the expression of epigenetic regulators histone deacetylase 1 (Hdac1), solute carrier family 16 member 3 (monocarboxylate transporter, Mct3) and DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) using quantitative PCR.", 
    "279": "Global DNA methylation was reduced in the renal cortices of animals treated with ACEi (P\u200a<\u200a0.05, Figure 1). Acute treatment with perindopril did not significantly change the renal expression of Hdac1, Dnmt1 and Mct3 (P\u200a>\u200a0.05).", 
    "280": "Acute treatment by ACEi results in a reduction in global DNA methylation indicating that epigenetics may play an important role in the 'legacy effect'. Further investigation into which specific genes contribute to these changes and if longer course of treatment have a higher impact in the expression of such genes is important.", 
    "281": "Treatment-resistant hypertension (TRH) is defined as the failure to achieve an office BP target of <140/90 mmHg (<130/80 mmHg in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) or diabetes) in patients with hypertension (HT), despite adherence to at least 3 antihypertensive medications at optimal tolerated doses, ideally including a diuretic (Calhoun et al., Circulation 2008). TRH identifies patients with hard-to-treat HT, who might benefit from specialist investigation and treatment. Although some studies put the prevalence of TRH as >10%, these levels may be inflated by white-coat hypertension and poor adherence. Indeed, PATHWAY-2 (Williams et al., Lancet 2016) and SYMPLICITY HNT-3 (Bhatt et al., NEJM 2014) suggest that true TRH is rarer than generally thought. Risk factors for TRH (which themselves increase cardiovascular risk) include obesity, older age, African ethnicity, CKD and diabetes. Although not fully addressed, evidence suggests that prolonged poorly controlled BP in TRH has a poor outcome.Before diagnosing TRH, pseudo-resistant HT must be excluded. Poor adherence to treatment - which may be caused by side-effects, complicated dosing schedules, pill burden, poor doctor-patient relationship, poor understanding or acceptance of the need for treatment, and medication cost -is common, with up to 40% of newly diagnosed hypertensive patients discontinuing medications within a year. Directly observed therapy and urine drug screens can be very helpful in its detection. Poor office BP measurement technique is another common problem. Sufficient rest, use of the right cuff, and repeated automated measurement in a quiet setting, is critical. ABPM (or at least home BP measurement) is crucial to excluding 'white coat' HT. In those diagnosed with true TRH, modifiable causes must be excluded, including diet, drugs, secondary endocrine and renal causes, and sleep apnoea. In most cases, however, the aetiology of TRH is multifactorial and treatment aimed at multiple targets.Treatment of TRH includes appropriate life-style change (focused on diet, salt intake, exercise, weight), withdrawal or minimization of offending drugs (including alcohol), and the use of effective multi-drug regimens. Pre-existing drug treatment should ideally combine a thiazide-like diuretic (TLD), calcium channel blocker, and ACE inhibitor/ARB. Optimising diuretic use appears very important, so use of a long-acting TLD, such as chlortalidone or indapamide, may help. Loop diuretics should be considered in CKD patients. Low-dose spironolactone (25\u200amg, increased to 50\u200amg, once daily) or eplerenone (both mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists) are now guideline approved as suitable 4th line agents in patients with TRH. Their success may be accounted for by the elevated aldosterone levels frequently found in TRH, either through undetected primary hyperaldosteronism or because aldosterone secretion escapes renin-angiotensin system blockade. Vital new evidence for the effectiveness of spironolactone in TRH comes from PATHWAY-2 (Williams et al., Lancet 2016). This randomised double-blind crossover trial involved sequential treatment with spironolactone (n\u200a=\u200a285), an \u03b11 blocker doxazosin (n\u200a=\u200a282), \u03b2 blocker bisoprolol (n\u200a=\u200a285) and placebo (n\u200a=\u200a274), each for 12 weeks. Spironolactone led to significantly greater mean reductions in systolic blood pressure than placebo (-10 [-11.7 to -8.74] mmHg, p\u200a<\u200a0.001), doxazosin (-5.64 [-69.1 to -4.36], p\u200a<\u200a0.001) and bisoprolol (-5.98 [-7.45 to -4.51] mmHg, p\u200a<\u200a0.0001) on home systolic BP readings taken at the final visit of each treatment cycle. The magnitude of BP lowering with spironolactone was inversely proportional to plasma renin concentration, an association not observed with either bisoprolol or doxazosin, supporting the role of sodium retention, volume expansion and low plasma renin in TRH. As well as clearly demonstrating the superiority of spironolactone in TRH, the drug was shown to be safe and well tolerated with no greater discontinuation rate due to renal impairment and hyperkalaemia than with the other treatments.An alternative promising approach is the use of endothelin (ET) receptor antagonists. These drugs, which block the vasoconstrictor, inflammatory and pro-atherogenic actions of ET-1, also reduce BP and proteinuria in CKD (Davenport et al., Pharmacol Rev 2016). Clinical trials have shown their efficacy in TRH (Weber et al., Lancet 2009), and phase 3 trials are currently ongoing in patients with diabetic nephropathy. Other drugs, such as b-blockers, a-blockers, centrally acting agents such as moxonidine or potent vasodilators, including hydralazine or minoxidil, may be considered in a multi-drug approach, depending on the clinical circumstances. The only combination that cannot be recommended is the addition of a second agent to block the renin-angiotensin system, with evidence of increased renal failure with the combination of ACE-I + ARB or ARB + renin inhibitor.Two promising non-pharmacological therapies have been under evaluation for the treatment of TRH - renal denervation (RDN) and baroreflex activation therapy (BAT). These are attractive targeted interventional options, with considerable underpinning evidence that sympathetic overactivity contributes to raised BP. However, when the first blinded and randomised study with RDN was performed, SYMPLICITY HNT-3 (Bhatt et al., NEJM 2014), it did no better than the sham procedure. Technically, it will be significantly easier to do randomised and blinded studies with BAT. However, currently, given their potential for adverse effects, and the lack of evidence of efficacy, RDN and BAT should only be used in the context of ongoing clinical research.This is an exciting time in the management of TRH. Spironolactone shows clear superiority to other standard treatments, and supports the case for excess sodium as a component of TRH. Other agents, such as ET antagonists, show promise. The results of SPRINT (The SPRINT Research Group, NEJM 2015) suggest we may need new lower targets for BP control, so TRH will become an increasing challenge. We also need good research on the risks of TRH, and what target blood pressures provide optimal outcomes.", 
    "282": "Beginning with the Veterans Administration (VA) Cooperative Hypertension Study of the 1960\u200as, blood pressure (BP) lowering with antihypertensive medications has been shown to reduce major cardiovascular (CV) outcomes, including coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure (HF) and CV and all-cause mortality in randomized controlled CV outcome trials. Multiple drugs were usually required in these trials to lower BP in treated participants. Medication regimens in the early trials, including the VA trial, included a thiazide-type diuretic (TTD) as initial therapy. Some later trials used a beta-blocker (BB) as initial therapy or compared BBs with other agents and the benefits of BBs were less consistent. One major trial showed benefit comparing a calcium channel blocker (CCB) with placebo. Several trials compared classes against one another as initial therapy. BBs and alpha blockers were less effective than several other major classes. Each of four drug classes, TTDs, CCBs, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) usually had comparable effects on mortality and CV and cerebrovascular outcomes, with one primary exception: HF. Initial treatment with a TTD was more effective than a CCB, ACEI, or alpha blocker, and an ACEI was more effective than a CCB in improving HF outcomes. In black patients, TTDs or CCBs appear to be more effective in reducing CV outcomes than ACEIs or ARBs. Although ACEIs or ARBs appear to preserve renal function better than other classes in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), they are not superior in reducing CV outcomes or mortality in patients with CKD. In clinical trials and practice at least 3 drugs in combination have been needed to control BP to <140/90\u200ammHg in at least half the time. Dosing of antihypertensive medications also appears important - full doses of the initial drug were used and needed to control BP in 70-80% of patients in hypertension CV outcome trials. Outcomes have been less robust when less than full doses have been allowed in trials. It is reasonable for the first three classes used to control BP in a patient be a TTD, CCB, and either an ACEI or ARB in most patients with hypertension, although other classes may be included if there is a strong indication, e.g., a BB in patients with coronary artery disease. In resistant hypertension, it is not clear whether adding one drug class will lower CV events more than others, but the addition of spironolactone lowered BP better than a BB or alpha blocker in a randomized trial. Amiloride or direct arterial vasodilators may also be effective.",

    "287": "With several lines of evidence, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are recommended in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction or heart failure after myocardial infarction, and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are indicated in patients who are intolerant of ACE inhibitors. Up to 20% of patients cannot tolerate ACE inhibitors due to adverse reactions such as cough or angioedema, ARBs could be an alternative to ACE inhibitors. However, there is lack of data whether ARBs are comparable to ACE inhibitors in patients with myocardial infarction. Here I review the role of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in patients with myocardial infarction, and would like to introduce the data from the Korean Acute Myocardial Infarction Registry (KAMIR) that found ARBs are comparable with ACE inhibitors in patients with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction with preserved left ventricular systolic function.", 
    "288": "Hypertensive patients have greater chances of such cardiovascular events as stroke, coronary heart disease, heart or renal failure, peripheral artery disease, and dementia. It is also well recognized that diabetes increases the cardiovascular risks in concert with hypertension. Therefore, main goals for an innovation of anti-hypertensive therapy would be to achieve further risk reduction by targeting the functional, metabolic, and structural alterations associated with hypertension. Professors Dzau and Braunwald et al proposed the concept of \"the cardiovascular disease continuum\" in 1991, and that hypertension may trigger the chain of events, leading to end-stage heart disease; however, this concept was quite new at that time, and there was some discussion whether \"the cardiovascular disease continuum\" is true or not. Fifteen years later, accumulating clinical and basic research evidence confirmed the validity of the concept of this cardiovascular disease continuum. Oxidative stress, and inflammation play a role in the initiation and continuation of this chain. Therefore, targeting oxidative stress and inflammation are important to interrupt the cardiovascular disease continuum. However, so far, neither anti-oxidative nor anti-inflammation strategy can work well to prevent hypertension and its related cardiovascular diseases. Low-grade inflammation has been proposed to play a key role in the pathogenesis of hypertension, and both innate and adaptive immune responses may participate in this process. Recent evidence also defined important roles of T-cell and T-cell-derived cytokines associated with angiotensin (Ang) II and catecholamine. We expect these new findings could provide us with novel avenues to beat hypertension, in terms of anti-oxidative stress and/or anti-inflammation.Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays a significant role in the cardiovascular disease continuum interacting with adrenergic system and other various mediators, and thereby RAAS mediates adaptive and maladaptive responses to tissue injury. Sympathetic hyperactivity and the activation of RAAS may promote hypertension or work as an amplifier of the pressor influence of other factors such as metabolic factors. Therefore, RAAS and sympathetic nervous system are the major targets of treatment of hypertension and its related cardiovascular complications. The two main interventional approaches, transcatheter renal denervation and baroreflex activation therapy, have been used in clinical practice for treatment of resistant hypertension and the renal denervation is also being evaluated for treatment of various comorbidities, although the efficacy of invasive sympatho-deactivating interventions have not yet been conclusively validated. In the past two decades, the development of the drugs for the treatment of hypertension and cardiovascular diseases has been largely focused on the inhibitors of RAAS, including immunization against Ang II.Novel pathways beyond the classical actions of RAAS, the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)/Ang II/Ang II type 1 (AT1) receptor axis, have been highlighted: the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas receptor axis and Ang II type 2 (AT2) receptor as a new opposing axis against the classical RAS axis as a protective arm of RAAS. Moreover, identification of alamandine and its receptor, Mas-related G-protein coupled receptor, provides new insights for the understanding of the physiological and pathophysiological role of the RAS. Further elucidation of the regulatory mechanisms of the functions of new protective arm of RAS beyond the classical RAAS could provide us with possibilities for the development of novel drugs that regulate RAAS in a more sophisticated manner, thereby treating hypertensive patients and achieving cardiovascular risk reduction more efficiently. Agonists of protective arm of RAS have been developed as new drugs for hypertension and several drugs of the agonists of protective arm of RAS are now in clinical trials. Several novel Ang II receptor interacting proteins have been also reported. AT1 receptor-associated protein (ATRAP) was cloned by us as specific binding protein of AT1 receptor C-terminal, and we and others reported that ATRAP could act as a negative regulator in AT1 receptor-mediated effects at least in part by the enhancement of AT1 receptor internalization. We cloned AT2 receptor interacting protein (ATIP) as a protein interacting specifically with the C-terminal tail of the AT2 receptor. We and others demonstrated that ATIP enhanced an important role of AT2 receptor-mediated wide variety of pathophysiological functions. Further elucidation of the functional regulation of these Ang II receptor associated proteins including their transcriptional control, and finding possible ligands could be helpful for new drug developments.I will review and discuss in this symposium \"Progression of Hypertensive Heart Disease\" focusing on the new therapeutic pharmacological approach with recent clinical evidences.", 
    "289": "Hypertension prevalence rates in most urbanized areas of Africa range from 20-30%, with a recent systematic review reporting 16.2% for sub-Saharan Africa. These rates are lower than those in the West but the age standardized rates are higher than in other regions of the world. The attendant morbidity and mortality are disproportionately high. For example, failure of nocturnal dipping and microalbuminuria, predictive of vascular disease, occur relatively early in the course of hypertension and predispose to early vascular disease. Multiple target organ damage occurs in a large proportion, up to 50%, of newly-diagnosed hypertensives and this is more marked when kidney disease is present.By most accounts, hypertension ranks second to glomerulonephritis as the commonest causes of ESRD in Africa, with diabetes rates rapidly increasing in the last 3 decades. The contribution of hypertension to the causation of ESRD is of the order of 25-35%, lower than in US Blacks, with the odds of developing ESRD increasing with increasing BP levels. Hypertension and renal disease often coexist, and nephrosclerosis can often be distinguished from primary renal disease by employing a set of parameters including age of onset of hypertension and renal disease, other clinical signs and level of proteinuria. In other cases, this could be difficult especially where investigative facilities are limited, a common situation in most parts of Africa. Indeed, up to 35% of cases of presumed nephrosclerosis may actually have primary renal disease, which can only be revealed after more extensive investigations.There is genetic heterogeneity in the susceptibility to kidney disease in hypertension associated with APOL 1 gene risk variants. In addition, environmental factors, including salt consumption, contribute to the propensity for elevated BP and vascular disease. The association with APOL 1 gene variants also raises the probability of an underlying glomerulopathy in kidneys which subsequently develop nephrosclerosis, sometimes despite adequate BP control. Glomerular hypertrophy appears to be the major pathogenetic path leading to nephrosclerosis, with loss of autoregulation initiating events which lead to hyperfiltration, glomerular hypertrophy and glomerulosclerosis. Glomerular and interstitial changes occur early and there are reports of proteinuria correlating with the BP. Albuminuria and reduced eGFR have been found in 3-15% and up to 60% respectively, of newly diagnosed hypertensives.Benign and malignant nephrosclerosis are recognized. Even with benign nephrosclerosis, the renal disease and outcome are worse than in other groups. There is a disproportionate occurrence of malignant hypertension, probably related to inadequate BP control and psychosocial stress, with resulting poor renal function and outcomes which appear to dominate the clinical picture. Renal involvement occurs in virtually all cases of malignant hypertension with proteinuria and haematuria occurring in 100% of cases in some reports. Mucoid intimal proliferation in the interlobular artery and afferent arteriole, occurs in 100% of cases, and fibrinoid necrosis in these sites and the glomerulus, occurs in over 80% of cases; these constitute the characteristic vascular lesions.In treatment, BP control is paramount in slowing the progression of kidney disease and reducing overall cardiovascular risk. Recommended drugs include diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) and calcium antagonists (CA). ACEIs and ARBs, increasingly used, are particularly effective in the additional reduction of proteinuria although BP reduction by other means may lead to more modest reductions in proteinuria. The use of dihydropyridine CA may carry some risk in this regard and the combination of ARB or ACEI and CA is gaining popularity despite the cost. In many parts of Africa, methyldopa is still widely used. Renal function often worsens, transiently, following reduction of BP in malignant hypertension, especially with severe renal disease, leading to early and temporary need for dialysis. Target BP of 140/90 mmHg is seldom achieved in the majority of patients with hypertensive renal disease in Africa, even though there are advocates for a lower target.Additional measures include control of glycaemia, lipidaemia, dietary protein restriction and avoidance of nephrotoxic agents, a particular problem in most parts of Africa. With ESRD, dialysis, usually haemodialysis, is given and there is growing use of renal transplantation. The availability of renal replacement therapy is however limited and only a small percentage of patients actually receive it. Reports have shown that under 20% of patients who start dialysis are able to sustain it for more than 3 months. Long term prognosis is influenced by degree of control of BP and availability of renal replacement therapy.", 
    "290": "According to the Singapore National Health Survey (NHS) of 2010, the population of the Republic of Singapore was 5.076,700, comprising four ethnic groups: Chinese (74.1%), Malays (13.4%), Indians (9.2%), and others (3.3%). The National Health Survey for 2016 is under way and due to be published in 2017. From the six-yearly national health surveys, the crude prevalence of clinical hypertension (HTn), defined as a sustained blood pressure \u2265 140/90 mmHg, in Singaporean residents aged 30 to 69 years rose from 22.2% in 1992 to 27.3% in 1998, but declined to 24.9% (2004) and to 23.5% in 2010.The NHS of 2010 demonstrated that 18.9% of residents aged 18 to 69 years (an age band of 52 years) had hypertension. Its data show that the age-specific prevalence of HTn rises in a pronounced way from the age of 40 years (16.7%) onwards. The age-specific prevalence of the disorder was 53.4% in persons aged 60-69 years, compared with 7.6% in those aged 30-39 years.The 2010 NHS showed, as have surveys in many other industrial nations, that more men (prevalence\u200a=\u200a26.4%) than women (20.7%) have HTn. A disproportionate number of Malays and Indians have HTn, compared with Chinese persons.A breakdown of the crude prevalence data from the 2010 NHS shows that the greatest prevalence of hypertension among persons aged 30-69 years occurred in Malay women (29.8%), Chinese men (27.2%), and Malay men (26.0%).Information from a National Nutrition Survey (NNS) in 2010 conducted by the Health Promotion Board, a unit of the Ministry of Health (MoH) in Singapore, showed that the overall dietary intake of sodium chloride (common salt) was 8500\u200amg (8.5 grams) per day in residents aged 30-69 years (Table 1).The dietary intake of sodium chloride was estimated by measuring the total amount of sodium in a 24-hour collection of urine. The urinary concentration of sodium was measured using a sodium-ion selective electrode. Men consumed significantly more salt than women. There was a noticeable reduction in the daily dietary salt intake between the age group 40-49 years (9000\u200amg) and those aged 60-69 years (7700\u200amg). The Indian and Chinese respondents in the Survey consumed more salt, 8700 and 8500\u200amg/day respectively, than the Malays (7600\u200amg/day).A study led by Associate Professor Rob Martinus Van Dam in the School of Public Health, National University of Singapore, is addressing the validation and calibration of a technique to estimate the 24-hour urinary content of sodium from measurements of sodium concentration in a spot urine sample. The technique is intended to raise the accuracy of spot urine sampling.It is difficult to interpret the significance of the decreased daily intake of salt in older persons, aged 50 to 69, in the face of the greater prevalence of hypertension in these age bands (31.9% in those aged 50-59 years, and 53.4% in those aged 60-69). For instance, some older persons might ingest less dietary sodium, or the net renal tubular excretion of sodium in the urine might decrease between age 50 and 69 years without any change in dietary sodium intake.Moreover, the treatment of hypertension in persons aged 50 to 69 years is likely to include diuretic agents, both thiazide drugs, and loop diuretics such as furosemide and bumetanide. In most hypertensive patients, long-term treatment with diuretics exposes older persons to a risk of hyponatraemia, hypokalemia, or both. The latter conditions result from a net increase in the urinary excretion of sodium and potassium (apart from increased free water excretion). Such diuretic-related loss of sodium in the urine also needs to be factored into the estimation of dietary sodium intake by means of 24-hour urinary sodium output.The increased prescription of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone blocking drugs to control HTn further confounds the estimation of dietary sodium intake from 24-hour urine collections. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers, both reduce the sodium- and water-retaining effects of aldosterone. Their effects on the urinary sodium content of older hypertensive patients also need consideration.The 2010 NHS showed a treated BP of < 140/90 mmHg was achieved in 69.1% of hypertensive patients. This was an improvement over the 52.9% of patients treated to target in 2004. However, as the 2010 NHS showed that about 26.3% of hypertensive persons were undiagnosed in the community, the 'successfully treated' proportion of hypertensive persons was actually 69.1% of 73.7%, i.e. 50.9% of the pool of known hypertensive persons.The concerted program of prevention and management of HTn in Singapore applies the principles of early detection via BP screening in persons aged 18+ years, and of good treatment within the complex of cardiovascular risk factors (+ diabetes mellitus, obesity, physical inactivity, dyslipidaemia, smoking, obstructive sleep apnoea, etc). Medisave money from each working person's central provident fund may be used to help pay for outpatient costs of antihypertensive treatment.Regardless of the confounded relation between dietary salt intake and HTn observed from NHS 2010 and NNS 2010, the MoH Clinical Practice Guidelines for Hypertension will contain advice to family physicians as well as hospital specialists to urge patients to cut their dietary intake of salt towards a moderate amount of 5000 to 6000\u200amg per day. Readily accessible methods of patient prompting and education include digital apps on smartphones and tablet computers, in a society in which mobile phones are owned by about 94% of the community.", 
    "291": "This study investigated the acute effects of angiotensin-(1-7) and AVE0991 on active tone and vasodilator responses to bradykinin and acetylcholine in isolated mesenteric arteries from Sprague-Dawley rats fed a high-salt (HS; 4% NaCl) versus a normal salt (NS; 0.4% NaCl) diet. Angiotensin-(1-7) and AVE0991 elicited relaxation, and angiotensin-(1-7) unmasked vasodilator responses to bradykinin in arteries from HS-fed rats. These effects of angiotensin-(1-7) and AVE0991 were inhibited by endothelium removal, A779, PD123319, HOE140 and L-NAME. Angiotensin-(1-7) also restored the acetylcholine-induced relaxation that was suppressed by the HS diet. Vasodilator responses to bradykinin and acetylcholine in the presence of angiotensin-(1-7) were mimicked by captopril and the AT2 receptor agonist CGP42112 in arteries from HS-fed rats. Thus, in contrast to salt-induced impairment of vascular relaxation in response to vasodilator stimuli, angiotensin-(1-7) induces endothelium-dependent and NO-mediated relaxation, unmasks bradykinin responses via activation of mas and AT2 receptors, and restores acetylcholine-induced vasodilation in HS-fed rats. AT2 receptor activation and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition shared the ability of angiotensin-(1-7) to enhance bradykinin and acetylcholine responses in HS-fed rats. These findings suggest a therapeutic potential for mas and/or AT2 receptor activation and ACE inhibition in restoring endothelial function impaired by elevated dietary salt intake or other pathological conditions.",

Di-block mPEG-PCL copolymers were synthesized and used to prepare of polymersomes for controlled release of enalapril as a hydrophilic drug. The various methods such as HNMR, FTIR, GPC, DSC, PCS and AFM performed for characterization of the polymersomes. The results of AFM showed that the polymersomes had spherical structure and the size of nanoparticles was 97\u2009nm. Drug-loading ef\ufb01ciency of nanoparticles from copolymers with compositions of mPEG1-PCL1, mPEG2-PCL2, and mPEG3-PCL3 were 14.43%, 19.8%, and 12.33% respectively. The release profile of enalapril for drug loaded nanoparticles prepared from mPEG3-PCL3 was very fast and release profile for the nanoparticles prepared from mPEG1-PCL1 and mPEG2-PCL2 was sustained. The IC50 value of enalapril was determined to be 8\u2009\u03bcM while EPM/m-PEG-PCL nanoparticles did not show significant toxicity at equal concentrations in comparison with enalapril drug. Therapeutic preparations of mPEG-PCL micelle are calibrated by the mouse LD50 assay. A dose-finding scheme of the polymeric micelle showed a safe dose of mPEG-PCL micelles was approximately 330\u2009mg/kg in mice. The relationship between the numbers of animals, number of doses, duration of the assay used to estimate the LD50 and the precision of the assay were investigated. Overall, the results was showed that m-PEG-PCL polymersomes can be considered as a promising carrier for hydrophilic drugs.",

The Swedish Primary Care Cardiovascular Database includes data from medical records, socioeconomic data, filled prescriptions, and hospitalizations from national registries for 75,000 patients with hypertension. Patients included in the study were initiated on antihypertensive drug treatment in primary healthcare in 2006 to 2007. We defined class persistence as the proportion remaining on the initial drug class, including 30 days of gap. Patients with a filled prescription of another antihypertensive drug class after discontinuation of the initial drug, including 30 days of gap, were classified as switchers. Persistence to the various drug classes were compared with that for diuretics.We identified 4997 patients (mean age 60\u200a\u00b1\u200a12 years in men and 63\u200a\u00b1\u200a13 years in women). Out of these, 95 (2%) filled their first prescription for fixed combination therapy and 4902 (98%) for monotherapy, including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (37%), angiotensin receptor blockers (4%), beta blockers (21%), calcium channel blockers (8%), and diuretics (28%). Persistence to the initial drug class was 57% after 1 year and 43% after 2 years. There were no differences in persistence between diuretics and any of the other antihypertensive drug classes, after adjustment for confounders. Discontinuation (all adjusted) was more common in men (P\u200a=\u200a0.004), younger patients (P\u200a<\u200a0.001), those with mild systolic blood pressure elevation (P\u200a<\u200a0.001), and patients born outside the Nordic countries (P\u200a<\u200a0.001). Among 1295 patients who switched drug class after their first prescription, only 21% had a blood pressure recorded before the switch occurred; and out them 69% still had high blood pressures.In conclusion, there appears to be no difference in drug class persistence between diuretics and other major antihypertensive drug classes, when factors known to be associated with poor persistence are taken into account.",

Patients on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers had the lowest risk for mood disorder admissions, and compared with this group, those on \u03b2-blockers (hazard ratio=2.11; [95% confidence interval, 1.12-3.98]; P=0.02) and calcium antagonists (2.28 [95% confidence interval, 1.13-4.58]; P=0.02) showed higher risk, whereas those on no antihypertensives (1.63 [95% confidence interval, 0.94-2.82]; P=0.08) and thiazide diuretics (1.56 [95% confidence interval, 0.65-3.73]; P=0.32) showed no significant difference. Overall, our exploratory findings suggest possible differential effects of antihypertensive medications on mood that merits further study: calcium antagonists and \u03b2-blockers may be associated with increased risk, whereas angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers may be associated with a decreased risk of mood disorders.",

Nine days before admission she had collapsed because of dizziness and had a cerebral concussion and open fracture of her nasal bone, however, no further investigations were carried out at that time. A physical examination revealed leg edema, tachycardia, tachypnea, bilateral basal crepitations, and blood pressure 110/70 mmHg. An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia, low voltage, negative T-waves in V5 and V6 and a corrected QT interval of 590 ms. Echocardiography revealed a reduced left ventricular systolic function with an ejection fraction of 30 %, and septal, apical, and anterior wall akinesia. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed relative enhancement of gadolinium, indicating hyperemia and capillary leakage, and no myocardial scars. Because of the improvement in her cardiac function, lack of cardiovascular risk factors, and lack of signs for ischemia on magnetic resonance imaging, no coronary angiography was carried out. The results of sellar and renal magnetic resonance imaging were normal. Her troponin T was slightly elevated. Bisoprolol and ramipril were started. Her fludrocortisone dose was reduced to 0.05 mg/day. Her electrocardiogram and systolic function, documented by echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging, normalized within 6 months.",

    "340": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) presents an important role in blood pressure regulation, since that converts angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II. Some commercially available ACE inhibitors are captopril, lisinopril and enalapril; due to their side effects, naturally occurring inhibitors have been prospected. In order to endorse this research field we have developed a new tool for ACE ligand screening. To this end, ACE was extracted from bovine lung, purified and chemically immobilized in modified ferrite magnetic beads (ACE-MBs). The ACE-MBs have shown a Michaelian kinetic behavior towards hippuryl-histidyl-leucine. Moreover, as proof of concept, the ACE-MBs was inhibited by lisinopril with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 10nM. At the fishing assay, ACE-MBs were able not only to fish out the reference inhibitor, but also one peptide from a pool of tryptic digested BSA. In conclusion, ACE-MBs emerge as new straightforward tool for ACE kinetics determination, inhibition and binder screening.", 
    "341": "The utility of measuring cardiac troponins (cTn) in asymptomatic patients during the perioperative period has been controversial. In the present substudy of the Cardiac Remote Ischemic Preconditioning Prior to Elective Vascular Surgery Trial (NCT01558596), we hypothesized that surveillance of myocardial injury with cTnI in the perioperative period would lead to initiation or intensification of medical therapies for coronary artery disease. Increases in cTnI \u22650.01\u00a0\u03bcg/l in the perioperative period were considered clinically significant. Intensification of medical therapy was defined as initiation of aspirin or initiation or increases in the dose of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers, statins, or \u03b2 blockers and was left to the discretion of treating physicians. From June 2011 to April 2015, a total of 185 patients (mean age 68 \u00b1 7 years, 100% men) were enrolled in the trial. A total of 28 patients (15%) had significant increases in cTnI after vascular surgery, and 38 (20.5%) had their medical therapies intensified in the perioperative period. Among patients with increases in cTnI, 11 (39%) had intensification of medical therapy versus 27 patients (17%) with no or smaller increases in cTnI (p\u00a0= 0.02). Among those patients with \u0394cTnI \u22650.01\u00a0\u03bcg/l, hospital readmissions at 3 to 6\u00a0months were 7.6% for the intensification group versus 25% for the no intensification group (p\u00a0= 0.18). Mortality rate at 6\u00a0months was low in both groups (2.6% vs 0%, respectively, p\u00a0= 0.13).

Patients at greatest risk for hyperkalemia include those with diabetes and those with impaired renal function in whom a defect in the excretion of renal potassium may already exist. Hyperkalemia is likely to become more common clinically because angiotensin receptor blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are increasingly being used in higher doses and are thought to confer cardiovascular and renal protection. Until recently, options for treating hyperkalemia were limited to the use of thiazide and loop diuretics and sodium polystyrene sulfonate. Newer options such as sodium zirconium cyclosilicate will allow for the safe and effective treatment of hyperkalemia while maintaining patients on prescribed renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors.",

However, this progress has been tempered by cardiotoxicity, associated with anticancer therapies, ranging from subclinical abnormalities to irreversible life-threatening complications, such as congestive heart failure or cardiomyopathy. In particular, exposure to chemotherapy (CHT), including anthracyclines and trastuzumab, can lead to cardiac dysfunction with short- or long-term consequences, among patients with breast cancer. The aim of this study is to highlight the potential role of commonly used cardiac medications in the prevention of anthracycline- and trastuzumab-mediated cardiotoxicity, in women with breast cancer, based on evidence from recent clinical trials. This overview is focused on the use of antihypertensive medications, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, outlining their cardioprotective effects in this patient population. In addition, the importance of biomarkers and modern imaging tests, as potential tools for detection and monitoring of cardiac dysfunction, induced by CHT, as well as some practical preventive and therapeutic strategies for cardio-oncology treatment teams, involved in the management of a growing number of women with breast cancer have been outlined. The content of this overview is based on a literature search of PubMed, within the last 5 years, mostly in relevance to the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive patients with breast cancer, treated with anthracycline or trastuzumab therapy (in addition to surgery and/or radiation therapy [RT] regimen).",

The study population consisted of 55 children aged 11\u2009\u00b1\u20094\u00a0years, diagnosed on the basis of the Oxford classification and MEST score of kidney biopsy findings. Proteinuria, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and the IgA/C3 serum ratio were assessed in all patients twice: at onset and at follow-up. The patients were treated with steroids, immunosuppressive drugs, and/or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Follow-up was at 3.9\u2009\u00b1\u20092.9 (median 2.7) years. The patients were subdivided into two groups: with GFR <90 and \u226590\u00a0mL/min at follow-up. ROC AUC curves and logistic regression were used to evaluate the power of prognostic factors. The two groups did not differ regarding the level of proteinuria, MEST score, and the IgA/C3 ratio at onset of disease. There was a significant association between GFR reductions at onset and follow-up (AUC\u2009=\u20090.660; p\u2009<\u20090.05). In patients with nephrotic range proteinuria at onset, proteinuria at follow-up was more frequent compared with other patients (AUC\u2009=\u20090.760; p\u2009<\u20090.05), MEST score \u22653 tended to be associated with reduced GFR (AUC\u2009=\u20090.650; p\u2009=\u20090.07) but not with proteinuria (AUC\u2009=\u20090.608; p\u2009=\u20090.47), and the IgA/C3 ratio was higher (p\u2009<\u20090.05) at follow-up. No significant associations were found between the IgA/C3 ratio at onset and reduced GFR (AUC\u2009=\u20090.565; p\u2009=\u20090.46) or proteinuria at follow-up (AUC\u2009=\u20090.263; p\u2009=\u20090.20). We conclude that predictors of poor outcome in childhood IgAN include the following: GFR reduction, nephrotic range proteinuria at onset of disease, and high MEST score in Oxford classification of kidney biopsy. Despite a higher serum IgA/C3 ratio in children with impaired renal function in long-term follow-up, we failed to demonstrate a significant association between this ratio at onset of disease and reduced GFR or persistent proteinuria at follow-up. Thus, IgA/C3 ratio is not a good foreteller of progression of IgA nephropathy in childhood.", 
    "355": "The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2/angiotensin (Ang)-(1-7)/Mas axis of the renin-angiotensin system often opposes the detrimental effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme/Ang II/Ang II type 1 receptor axis and has been associated with beneficial effects on glucose homeostasis, whereas underlying mechanisms are mostly unknown. Here we investigate the effects of Ang-(1-7) and its receptor Mas on \u03b2-cell function. Isolated islets from Mas-deficient and wild-type mice were stimulated with Ang-(1-7) or its antagonists and effects on insulin secretion determined. Islets' cytoplasmic calcium and cAMP concentrations, mRNA amounts of Ins1, Ins2, Pdx1, and Mafa and effects of inhibitors of cAMP downstream signaling were determined. Ang-(1-7) was also applied to mice by osmotic pumps for 14 days and effects on glucose tolerance and insulin secretion were assessed. Ang-(1-7) increased insulin secretion from wild-type islets, whereas antagonists and genetic Mas deficiency led to reduced insulin secretion. The Mas-dependent effects of Ang-(1-7) on insulin secretion did not result from changes in insulin gene expression or changes in the excitation-secretion coupling but from increased intracellular cAMP involving exchange protein activated directly by cAMP. Administration of Ang-(1-7) in vivo had only marginal effects on glucose tolerance in wild-type mice but still resulted in improved insulin secretion from islets isolated of these mice. Interestingly, although less pronounced than in wild types, Ang-(1-7) still affected insulin secretion in Mas-deficient islets. The data indicate a significant function of Ang-(1-7) in the regulation of insulin secretion from mouse islets in vitro and in vivo, mainly, but not exclusively, by Mas-dependent signaling, modulating the accessory pathway of insulin secretion via increase in cAMP.",

    "371": "Novel N-tuple topological/geometric cutoffs to consider specific inter-atomic relations in the QuBiLS-MIDAS framework are introduced in this manuscript. These molecular cutoffs permit the taking into account of relations between more than two atoms by using (dis-)similarity multi-metrics and the concepts related with topological and Euclidean-geometric distances. To this end, the kth two-, three- and four-tuple topological and geometric neighbourhood quotient (NQ) total (or local-fragment) spatial-(dis)similarity matrices are defined, to represent 3D information corresponding to the relations between two, three and four atoms of the molecular structures that satisfy certain cutoff criteria. First, an analysis of a diverse chemical space for the most common values of topological/Euclidean-geometric distances, bond/dihedral angles, triangle/quadrilateral perimeters, triangle area and volume was performed in order to determine the intervals to take into account in the cutoff procedures. A variability analysis based on Shannon's entropy reveals that better distribution patterns are attained with the descriptors based on the cutoffs proposed (QuBiLS-MIDAS NQ-MDs) with regard to the results obtained when all inter-atomic relations are considered (QuBiLS-MIDAS KA-MDs - 'Keep All'). A principal component analysis shows that the novel molecular cutoffs codify chemical information captured by the respective QuBiLS-MIDAS KA-MDs, as well as information not captured by the latter. Lastly, a QSAR study to obtain deeper knowledge of the contribution of the proposed methods was carried out, using four molecular datasets (steroids (STER), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), thermolysin inhibitors (THER) and thrombin inhibitors (THR)) widely used as benchmarks in the evaluation of several methodologies. One to four variable QSAR models based on multiple linear regression were developed for each compound dataset following the original division into training and test sets. The results obtained reveal that the novel cutoff procedures yield superior performances relative to those of the QuBiLS-MIDAS KA-MDs in the prediction of the biological activities considered. From the results achieved, it can be suggested that the proposed N-tuple topological/geometric cutoffs constitute a relevant criteria for generating MDs codifying particular atomic relations, ultimately useful in enhancing the modelling capacity of the QuBiLS-MIDAS 3D-MDs.",

There is lack of uniformity in the treatment of CSDH amongst surgeons in terms of various treatment strategies. Clinical presentation may vary from no symptoms to unconsciousness. CSDH is usually diagnosed by contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan is more sensitive in the diagnosis of bilateral isodense CSDH, multiple loculations, intrahematoma membranes, fresh bleeding, hemolysis, and the size of capsule. Contrast-enhanced CT or MRI could detect associated primary or metastatic dural diseases. Although definite history of trauma could be obtained in a majority of cases, some cases may be secondary to coagulation defect, intracranial hypotension, use of anticoagulants and antiplatelet drugs, etc., Recurrent bleeding, increased exudates from outer membrane, and cerebrospinal fluid entrapment have been implicated in the enlargement of CSDH. Burr-hole evacuation is the treatment of choice for an uncomplicated CSDH. Most of the recent trials favor the use of drain to reduce recurrence rate. Craniotomy and twist drill craniostomy also play a role in the management. Dural biopsy should be taken, especially in recurrence and thick outer membrane. Nonsurgical management is reserved for asymptomatic or high operative risk patients. The steroids and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors may also play a role in the management. Single management strategy is not appropriate for all the cases of CSDH.

ACE inhibitors have also been reported to decrease normal tissue complication in radiation oncology patients. In the current study, the authors have developed a rat partial-body irradiation (leg-out PBI) model with minimal bone marrow sparing (one leg shielded) that results in acute and late injuries to multiple organs. In this model, the ACE inhibitor lisinopril (at ~24 mg m d started orally in the drinking water at 7 d after irradiation and continued to \u2265150 d) mitigated late effects in the lungs and kidneys after 12.5-Gy leg-out PBI. Also in this model, a short course of saline hydration and antibiotics mitigated acute radiation syndrome following doses as high as 13 Gy. Combining this supportive care with the lisinopril regimen mitigated overall morbidity for up to 150 d after 13-Gy leg-out PBI. Furthermore, lisinopril was an effective mitigator in the presence of the growth factor G-CSF (100 \u03bcg kg d from days 1-14), which is FDA-approved for use in a radionuclear event. In summary, by combining lisinopril (FDA-approved for other indications) with hydration and antibiotics, acute and delayed radiation injuries in multiple organs were mitigated.",

Only systolic BP significantly decreased in those treated with antihypertensive medications compared with those untreated. The most commonly used classes were angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis) and calcium channel blockers (CCBs). Use of either of these drug classes was not associated with a significant decrease in either systolic or diastolic BP compared with the use of other drug classes.", 
    "413": "Antihypertensive drug therapy is more commonly prescribed in the ED in individuals with both elevated systolic and diastolic BP, but leads to a significant decrease only in systolic BP. Use of either ACEis or CCBs is not associated with a significant decrease in either systolic or diastolic BP compared with other drug classes.",

The target of this review is all health care professionals who treat patients with heart failure. Areas covered: This article discusses stages of heart failure, treatment of heart failure with general measures, and drug therapy with diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta blockers, aldosterone antagonists, isosorbide dinitrate plus hydralazine, digoxin, other neurohormonal antagonists, sacubitril/valsartan, calcium channel blockers, and ivabradine. This article also discusses treatment of heart failure with use of cardiac resynchronization therapy, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, and surgical therapy, and management of end-stage heart failure. This paper was written after an extensive Medline search reviewing articles written from 1970 through May, 2016. Expert commentary: Our approach as physicians must emphasize prevention of heart failure as well as treating it. Risk factors for developing heart failure, especially hypertension, must be better controlled starting in childhood. I concur with the current heart failure treatment guidelines (Tables 1 and 2 in this paper).", 
    "415": "Background. Late pregnancy usage of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) may cause severe oligohydramnios due to fetal renal impairment. Affected neonates will often suffer from fatal, renal, and respiratory failure. Case. A 39-year-old multigravida admitted due to anhydramnios secondary to valsartan (ARB) exposure at 30 weeks' gestation. Following secession of treatment amniotic fluid volume returned to normal. Delivery was induced at 34 weeks' gestation following premature rupture of membranes and maternal fever. During the two-year follow-up, no signs of renal insufficiency were noted. Conclusions. This description of reversible fetal renal damage due to ARB intake during pregnancy is the first to show no adverse renal function in a two-year follow-up period. This case may help clinicians counsel patients with pregnancies complicated by exposure to these drugs.",

The renin-angiotensin system blockers such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) have exhibited anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects in patients with various diseases. We explored the effects of ACEi and ARBs on the risk of pneumonia in patients with COPD.",

A total of 130 COPD patients admitted with pneumonia were included, and 245 COPD patients without pneumonia were selected as controls from a total of 1,646 such patients. Controls were matched with test patients by age, sex, and severity of airflow limitation. The effects of ACEi/ARBs use on the odds ratio (OR) for the development of pneumonia were tested through conditional logistic regression.", 
    "418": "Elderly patients (over 70 years of age) constituted ~30% of each group; most of the patients were male (85%). Of the COPD patients with pneumonia, 21.5% had taken ACEi/ARBs for a mean of 9.8 months (standard deviation \u00b13.5 months). The proportions of ACEi/ARBs users and the mean duration of such use did not differ when compared to those of the control patients (26.9%, P=0.25; 9.6\u00b13.6 months, P=0.83). Univariate analyses indicated that the use of ACEi/ARBs was not associated with a decreased risk of pneumonia (OR =0.70, 95% confidence interval 0.41-1.23, P=0.21), whereas both a history of pulmonary tuberculosis (OR =1.85, 95% confidence interval 1.12-3.06, P=0.02) and exposure to systemic steroids (OR =2.33, 95% confidence interval 1.28-4.23, P=0.005) did show an association. After adjustment for a history of tuberculosis, comorbid chronic renal disease, and exposure to corticosteroids, ACEi/ARBs reduced the risk of pneumonia in COPD patients (OR =0.51, 95% confidence interval 0.27-0.98, P=0.04).",

    "420": "Heart failure is one of the major public health challenges facing the Western world. Its prevalence is increasing as the population ages and modern techniques are implemented to manage cardiac disease. In response, there has been a sustained effort to develop novel strategies to address the high levels of associated morbidity and mortality. Indeed, agents that target the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) have transformed the way in which we manage heart failure. Despite this, mortality in heart failure is poorer than in many malignancies and a large burden of morbidity and recurrent hospitalisation remains. Here, we review the role of RAAS modulation within the field of systolic heart failure. In particular, we provide practical guidance on using current RAAS blockade agents and focus on the recent emergence of new agents that promise additional substantial benefit to those living with left ventricular systolic dysfunction.",

Monthly sales were expressed as defined daily doses per 1000 insured population per month (DDD/TIM). Interrupted time-series models were used to estimate the changes in slope and level of medicines use after the policy change. ARIMA models were used to correct for autocorrelation and stationarity.", 
    "423": "Only the SSRIs saw a significant rise in level of generic utilisation (0.2 DDD/TIM; P < 0.001) and a fall in originator usage (-0.1 DDD/TIM; P < 0.001) after the policy change. Utilisation of generic PPIs fell (level 0.06 DDD/TIM, P = 0.048; slope 0.01 DDD/TIM, P = 0.043), but utilisation of originator products also grew (level 0.05 DDD/TIM, P < 0.001; slope 0.003, P = 0.001). Generic calcium antagonists and ACE-I showed an increase in slope (0.01 DDD/TIM, P = 0.016; 0.02 DDD/TIM, P < 0.001), while the originators showed a decrease in slope (-0.003 DDD/TIM, P = 0.046; -0.01 DDD/TIM, P < 0.001). There were insufficient data on generic statin use before the policy change to allow for analysis.", 
    "424": "The mandatory offer of generic substitution appeared to have had a quantifiable effect on utilisation patterns in the 2 years after May 2003. Managed care interventions that were already in place before the intervention may have blunted the extent of the changes seen in this period. Generic policies are an important enabling provision for cost-containment efforts. However, decisions taken outside of official policy may anticipate or differ from that policy, with important consequences.",

Two colitis models were studied: (1) Acute colitis was induced in 8- to 10-week-old C57BL/6J mice by 2.5\u00a0% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS, in drinking water) for 7\u00a0days. (2) IL10-/-colitis Piroxicam (200\u00a0ppm) was administered orally in feed to 5-week-old IL-10-/-mice (C57BL/6J background) for 14\u00a0days followed by enalaprilat (ACE-I), CCG-203025 or PBS administered transanally for 14\u00a0days.",

However, the knowledge of the natural course of hypertension and kidney disease in FHH rats remains fragmentary and the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are unclear. In this study, over the animals' lifetime, we followed the survival rate, blood pressure (telemetry), indices of kidney damage, the activity of renin-angiotensin (RAS) and nitric oxide (NO) systems, and CYP450-epoxygenase products (EETs). Compared to normotensive controls, no elevation of plasma and renal RAS was observed in prehypertensive and hypertensive FHH rats; however, RAS inhibition significantly reduced systolic blood pressure (137 \u00b1 9 to 116 \u00b1 8, and 159 \u00b1 8 to 126 \u00b1 4 mmHg, respectively) and proteinuria (62 \u00b1 2 to 37 \u00b1 3, and 132 \u00b1 8 to 87 \u00b1 5 mg/day, respectively). Moreover, pharmacological RAS inhibition reduced angiotensin (ANG) II and increased ANG 1-7 in the kidney and thereby may have delayed the progression of kidney disease. Furthermore, renal NO and EETs declined in the aging FHH rats but not in the control strain. The present results, especially the demonstration of exaggerated vascular responsiveness to ANG II, indicate that RAS may contribute to the development of hypertension and kidney disease in FHH rats. The activity of factors opposing the development of hypertension and protecting the kidney declined with age in this model. Therefore, therapeutic enhancement of this activity besides RAS inhibition could be attempted in the therapy of human hypertension associated with kidney disease.", 
    "430": "Secretion of renin juxtaglomerular cells into bloodstream initiates activation of an enzymatic-hormonal cascade known as the RAAS (renin - angiotensin - aldosterone system). As a result, blood pressure is increased by the means several interrelated mechanisms. Mechanism of Zjednoczoaction of this system has been known for decades, but a few previously unknown components were recently added, such as ACE-2 and Ang(1-7), and their role often seems to be opposite to that of the conventional components. Local tissue systems also have important biological functions. They operate largely independently of the systemic activity, and their activity is observed primarily in the kidney, heart, in blood vessels, adrenal gland and nervous system. Angiotensin-2 (Ang-2), the main RAAS effector, has a wide scope of action, and thus abnormalities in its functioning have many consequences. Excessive activation is accompanied by chronic inflammation, as Ang-2 stimulates inflammatory mediators. As a result, degenerative processes and atherosclerosis are initiated. RAAS imbalance is associated with the most common diseases of civilization, such as cardio-vascular diseases, diabetes, kidney diseases, preeclampsia, osteoporosis and even neurodegenerative diseases. Many of these pathological processes are attributed to the excessive activation of tissue RA system. Therapeutic strategies based on inhibition of the RAAS are commonly used mainly in the treatment of hypertension and other cardiovascular disorders. The benefits of this class of drugs is primarily a decrease in blood pressure, but also the suppression of inflammatory processes and other pathological phenomena resulting from excessive activation of the RAAS. For that reason, some consider to use RAAS inhibitors in other diseases, e.g. Parkinson's disease. Further studies give hope for the improvement of RAAS inhibitor therapy and the development of new therapeutic strategies.", 
    "431": "Mitral regurgitation (MR) is a common valvular disorder that has important health and economic consequences. Standardized guidelines exist regarding when and in whom to perform mitral valve surgery, but little information is available regarding medical treatment of MR. Many patients with moderate or severe MR do not meet criteria for surgery or are deemed to be at high risk for surgical therapy. We reviewed the available published data on medical therapy in the treatment of patients with primary MR. b-blockers and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors had the strongest supporting evidence for providing beneficial effects. b-blockers appear to lessen MR, prevent deterioration of left ventricular function, and improve survival in asymptomatic patients with moderate to severe primary MR. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker therapy reduces MR, especially in asymptomatic patients. However, in the setting of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or mitral valve prolapse, vasodilators can increase the severity of MR. To define the precise role of medical therapy, a larger randomized controlled trial is needed to confirm benefit and assess in which subsets of patients medical therapy is most useful. Medical therapy in some patients improves symptoms, lessens MR, and may delay the need for surgical intervention.", 
    "432": "Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTS) is a peculiar clinical condition often affecting postmenopausal women after a stressful trigger. The underlying mechanisms have not been completely elucidated but several hypotheses have been advanced, with catecholamine cardiotoxicity, microvascular dysfunction and coronary artery spasm each suggested to play a role. The incidence of stroke after TTS appears to range from 0% to 7.7%, and interestingly TTS has been described as both a cause and a complication of stroke. We sought to assess the incidence and predictors of stroke during the index event (peri-index event stroke) in a heterogeneous TTS population. We conducted a retrospective descriptive study reviewing patients who were discharged with a diagnosis of TTS from the Einstein Medical Center, Philadelphia, PA and Danbury Hospital, Danbury, CT in the period between 2003 and 2014. A total of Incidence and predictors of stroke during the index event in an ethnically diverse Takotsubo cardiomyopathy population 206 patients met the modified Mayo Clinic criteria and were included in the study. The patients' overall mean age was 67.8 years; 87% (n=179) were females and 25% (n=53) were African Americans. The following incidence rates were found: stroke 7%, in-hospital heart failure 26.7%, and in-hospital death 7%. On multivariate analysis independent predictors (expressed as odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals) of periindex event stroke were: i) African American race (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.2-10.2, p=0.048); ii) hypertension (OR 10.5, 95% CI 1.3-88, p=0.03). ACE inhibitor use was a protective factor for developing peri-index event stroke (OR 0.15, 95% CI 0.04-0.5, p=0.001). There was a trend towards dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) being protective for stroke (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.05-1.1, p=0.08). The incidence of peri-index event stroke was 7%. African American race and hypertension were found to be independent predictors of peri-index event stroke. Prospective clinical trials are needed to confirm these findings and to better determine the impact of hypertension as a risk factor for stroke and to assess the role of DAPT in preventing it.",

More than half of the mortality that is seen in the diabetic population can be ascribed to cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes not only myocardial infarction due to premature atherosclerosis but also diabetic cardiomyopathy. The importance of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) antagonism in the prevention of diabetic CVD has demonstrated the key role that the RAAS plays in diabetic CVD onset and development. Today, ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers represent the first line therapy for primary and secondary CVD prevention in patients with diabetes. Recent research has uncovered new dimensions of the RAAS and, therefore, new potential therapeutic targets against diabetic CVD.

    "458": "Cardiovascular and renal pathologies are frequently associated with an activated renin-angiotensin-system (RAS) and increased levels of its main effector and vasoconstrictor hormone angiotensin II (Ang II). Angiotensin-converting-enzyme-2 (ACE2) has been described as a crucial enzymatic player in shifting the RAS towards its so-called alternative vasodilative and reno-protective axis by enzymatically converting Ang II to angiotensin-(1-7) (Ang-(1-7)). Yet, the relative contribution of ACE2 to Ang-(1-7) formation in vivo has not been elucidated. Mass spectrometry based quantification of angiotensin metabolites in the kidney and plasma of ACE2 KO mice surprisingly revealed an increase in Ang-(1-7), suggesting additional pathways to be responsible for alternative RAS activation in vivo. Following assessment of angiotensin metabolism in kidney homogenates, we identified neprilysin (NEP) to be a major source of renal Ang-(1-7) in mice and humans. These findings were supported by MALDI imaging, showing NEP mediated Ang-(1-7) formation in whole kidney cryo-sections in mice. Finally, pharmacologic inhibition of NEP resulted in strongly decreased Ang-(1-7) levels in murine kidneys. This unexpected new role of NEP may have implications for the combination therapy with NEP-inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor-blockade, which has been shown being a promising therapeutic approach for heart failure therapy.",

CKD patients may also have comorbidities such as hypertension and diabetes for which they require more frequent care from different providers, and for which standard, but countervailing treatments, may put them at risk for adverse safety events. Areas covered: In addition to the well-known agents such as iodinated radiocontrast, antimicrobials, diuretics and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors which can directly affect renal function, safety considerations in the treatment of common CKD complications such as anemia, diabetes, analgesia and thrombosis will also be discussed. Expert opinion: Better outcomes in CKD may be achieved by alerting care providers to the special care needs of kidney patients and encouraging patients to self-manage their disease with the decision support of multidisciplinary patient care teams.",

Receipt of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers was associated with reduced medullary oxygenation (p = 0.01). In a multivariable model, chronic receipt of beta-blockers was the only significant predictor of renal tissue oxygenation (\u03b2 = 8.4, p = 0.008). Beta-blocker therapy was not associated with significant changes in renal artery blood flow, suggesting that improved renal oxygenation may be related to reduced renal oxygen consumption.",

Drug repurposing, applying known drugs and compounds to new indications, has been noted recently as a cost-effective and time-unconsuming way in developing new drugs, because they have already been proven safe in humans. In this review, we discuss drug repurposing of approved cardiovascular drugs, such as aspirin, beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, cardiac glycosides and statins. Regarding anti-tumor activities of these agents, a number of experimental studies have demonstrated promising pleiotropic properties, whereas all clinical trials have not shown expected results. In pathological conditions other than cancer, repurposing of cardiovascular drugs is also expanding. Numerous experimental studies have reported possibilities of drug repurposing in this field and some of them have been tried for new indications ('bench to bedside'), while unexpected results of clinical studies have given hints for drug repurposing and some unknown mechanisms of action have been demonstrated by experimental studies ('bedside to bench'). The future perspective of experimental and clinical studies using cardiovascular drugs are also discussed.",

Besides, hyperuricemia is a risk factor of gout as well as ischemic heart disease in hypertensive patients. Moreover, the risk of gout is modified by antihypertensive drugs. However, it remains unclear how antihypertensive agents affect uric acid metabolism. Purpose: In the present study, we investigated the uric acid metabolism in treated hypertensive patients to find out whether any of them would influence serum levels of uric acid. Patients and methods: 751 hypertensive patients (313 men and 438 women) under antihypertensive treatment were selected. Blood pressure (BP), serum uric acid (SUA) and serum creatinine (Scr) were measured and evaluated statistically. Results: In patients treated with diuretics, beta-blockers and/or alpha-1 blockers SUA levels were significantly higher than in patients who were not taking these drugs. Besides, the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in patients treated with diuretics, beta-blockers and/or alpha-1 blockers was negatively correlated with SUA level. There were gender differences in the effects of beta-blockers and alpha-1 blockers. Multiple regression analysis indicated that both diuretics and beta-blockers significantly contributed to hyperuricemia in patients with medication for hypertension. Conclusion: Diuretics, beta-blockers and alpha-1 blockers reduced glomerular filtration rate and raised SUA levels. Calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, including losartan, did not increase SUA levels.",

Furthermore, recently work studying demonstrated that stimulation of activin An expression in rat aortic smooth muscle (RASM) cells by angiotensin II (Ang II). Ramipril is a recently developed angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. To investigate the effects of Ramipril on expression of ACT A-FS, we established the rat model of heart failure after myocardial infarction (MI), and divided into either a sham operation (SO), MI, or MI-Ramipril group. We found that Ramipril significantly attenuates collagen-I and III deposition (col-I and III). Notably, we determined that expression of ACT A and II activin receptor (ActRII) were significantly down-regulated in the non-infarcted area of the left ventricle in the Ramipril group, whereas the mRNA and protein levels of FS were markedly up-regulated. Our data suggested that Ramipril benefited left ventricular remodeling by reducing fibrosis and collagen accumulation in the left ventricle of rats after myocardial infarction. This observation was also associated with down-regulation of ACT A expression. This study elucidated a new protective mechanism of Ramipril and suggests a novel strategy for treatment of post-infarct remodeling and subsequent heart failure.", 
    "467": "Scleroderma renal crisis (SRC) is a rare, potentially life-threatening complication that affects 2-15% of patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc, also known as scleroderma). SRC typically presents in patients with early, rapidly progressive, diffuse cutaneous SSc within the first 3-5 years after the onset of a non-Raynaud sign or symptom. SRC is characterized by an acute, usually symptomatic increase in blood pressure, a rise in serum creatinine levels, oliguria and thrombotic microangiopathy in about 50% of patients. The prognosis of SRC substantially improved in the 1980s with the introduction of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors for rapid blood pressure control, with additional antihypertensive agents as required. However, the survival of patients with SRC can still be improved. Current patient survival is 70-82% at 1 year, but decreases to 50-60% at 5 years despite dialysis support. Patients with SRC who show no signs of renal functional recovery despite timely blood pressure control are candidates for transplantation. In this Review, we discuss progress made in the identification and proactive management of patients at risk of SRC and make recommendations aimed at optimizing management for those who progress to chronic kidney failure.",

Animal models have been extensively used to assess the teratogenic potential of pharmacological agents and to study their teratogenic mechanisms; however, a still open issue concerns how the information gained through animal models can be translated to humans. Instead, significant information can be obtained by the identification and analysis of human genetic syndromes characterized by clinical features overlapping with those observed in drug-induced embryopathies. Until now, genetic phenocopies have been reported for the embryopathies/fetopathies associated with prenatal exposure to warfarin, leflunomide, mycophenolate mofetil, fluconazole, thalidomide and ACE inhibitors. In most cases, genetic phenocopies are caused by mutations in genes encoding for the main targets of teratogens or for proteins belonging to the same molecular pathways. The aim of this paper is to review the proposed teratogenic mechanisms of these drugs, by the analysis of human monogenic disorders and their molecular pathogenesis.",

This study aimed to investigate whether captopril pretreatment was able to protect lung against APALI via inhibiting angiotensin II (Ang II) production and suppressing Rho/ROCK (Rho kinase) pathway in rats. Severe AP (SAP) was introduced to rats by bile-pancreatic duct retrograde injection of 5% sodium taurocholate. Rats were randomly divided into three groups. In the sham group, sham operation was performed; in the SAP group, SAP was introduced; in the pre-cpl + SAP group, rats were intragastrically injected with 5\u00a0mg/kg captopril 1 hour prior to SAP induction. Pathological examination of the lung and pancreas, evaluation of pulmonary vascular permeability by wet/dry ratio and Evans Blue staining, detection of serum amylase, Western blot assay for Ang II receptor type 1 (AT1), RhoA, ROCK (Rho kinase), and MLCK (myosin light chain kinase) were performed after the animals were sacrificed at 24 hours. After the surgery, characteristic findings of pancreatitis were observed, accompanied by lung injury. The serum amylase, Ang II, and lung expression of AT1, RhoA, ROCK, and MLCK increased dramatically in SAP rats. However, captopril pretreatment improved the histological changes, reduced the pathological score of the pancreas and lung, inhibited serum amylase and Ang II production, and decreased expression of AT1, RhoA, ROCK, and MLCK in the lung. These findings suggest that captopril pretreatment is able to protect the lung against APALI, which is, at least partially, related to the inhibition of Ang II production and the suppression of the Rho/ROCK pathway.",

    "480": "Angiotensin-1-converting enzyme (ACE) is a zinc metalloprotease that plays a major role in blood pressure regulation via the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. ACE consists of two domains with differences in inhibitor binding affinities despite their 90% active site identity. While the C-domain primarily controls blood pressure, the N-domain is selective for cleavage of the antifibrotic N-acetyl-Ser-Asp-Lys-Pro. Inhibitors, such as 33RE, that selectively bind to the N-domain thus show potential for treating fibrosis without affecting blood pressure. The aim of this study was to elucidate the molecular mechanism of this selectivity. ACE inhibition by 33RE was characterized using a continuous kinetic assay with fluorogenic substrate. The N-domain displayed nanomolar (Ki = 11.21 \u00b1 0.74 nm) and the C-domain micromolar (Ki = 11 278 \u00b1 410 nm) inhibition, thus 1000-fold selectivity. Residues predicted to contribute to selectivity based on the N-domain-33RE co-crystal structure were subsequently mutated to their C-domain counterparts. S2 subsite mutation with resulting loss of a hydrogen bond drastically decreased the affinity (Ki = 2 794 \u00b1 156 nm), yet did not entirely account for selectivity. Additional substitution of all unique S2 ' residues, however, completely abolished selectivity (Ki = 10 009 \u00b1 157 nm). Interestingly, these residues do not directly bind 33RE. All mutants were therefore subjected to molecular dynamics simulations in the presence and absence of 33RE. Trajectory analyses highlighted the importance of these S2 ' residues in formation of a favourable interface between the ACE subdomains and thus a closed, ligand-bound complex. This study provides a molecular basis for the intersubsite synergism governing 33RE's 1000-fold N-selectivity and aids the future design of novel inhibitors for fibrosis treatment.",

Treatment of heart failure has also shown striking variations in recent years. Such is the case of the substitution of sympathomimetic drugs by beta-blocking agents, which primarily means a conceptual change in the pathophysiological interpretation of this syndrome. Incorporating to the treatment of heart failure drugs such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers has meant a great step forward in the treatment of patients with this condition that significantly has decreased mortality and morbidity. The latest introduction of the drug identified as angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (LCZ696), launched in August 2014 with an even greater reduction in mortality and morbidity of heart failure and fewer side effects, offers a valid hope in the treatment of this pathology. Training and physical activity is another area of treatment being completely reassessed.

Male pigs were randomly assigned to three groups: sham\u2011operated group, saline treatment group and enalapril treatment group. Thirty minutes after drug infusion, the animals in the saline and enalapril groups were subjected to ventricular fibrillation (8\u00a0min) followed by cardiopulmonary resuscitation (up to 30\u00a0min). Cardiac function was monitored, and myocardial tissue and blood were collected for analysis. Enalapril pre\u2011treatment did not improve cardiac function or the 6-h survival rate after CA and resuscitation; however, this intervention ameliorated myocardial ultrastructural damage, reduced the level of plasma cardiac troponin\u00a0I and decreased myocardial apoptosis.

The prevalence of revascularization by PCIs including chronic total occlusion (CTO) was significantly greater in the improved EF group (45.0%) as compared to the non-improved EF group (11.1%) (P = 0.02). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that revascularization by PCIs including CTO was the significant determinant of the LVEF improvement after adjusting for confounding factors (OR 5.43, 95% CI 1.06-27.74, P = 0.04).

Renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RASi) attenuate cardiac remodelling in various conditions, but the safety and efficacy of RASi in AVS is unsure. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to address these issues. We identified three smaller randomized clinical trials and five observational studies eligible for inclusion (PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane library search criteria: aortic stenosis, aortic valve, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor in different combinations, published in English at any time up to 1 April 2016). Our analyses suggested that use of RASi was safe, with no observed increase in mortality risk [576/3389 patients receiving RASi vs. 1118/4384 controls died; relative risk 0.93 (95% confidence interval 0.78-1.11), P = 0.44]. Use of RASi was also observed to lower the risk of aortic valve replacement (AVR) surgery [67/2913 patients with RASi vs. 154/3666 controls underwent AVR; relative risk 0.68 (95% confidence interval 0.51-0.91), P = 0.01]. In current clinical practice (based on published literature; mainly observational studies), use of RASi appears to be safe in patients with AVS and may reduce the need for AVR, but the evidence is overall weak. Large-scale randomized clinical trials are warranted to address whether prescription of RASi to treatment-na\u00efve patients may prevent disease progression, delay AVR surgery need, and lower the risk of mortality.", 
    "508": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) are widely used in the treatment of hypertension, congestive heart failure and renal disease, and are considered relatively safe and generally well-tolerated drugs. However, adverse effects of ACEIs have been reported, including non-productive cough and angioedema, which can lead to poor adherence to therapy. The mechanisms by which ACEIs promote adverse effects are not fully elucidated, although increased bradykinin plasma levels following ACEI therapy seem to play an important role. Since bradykinin can sensitise the transient potential vanilloid receptor 1 (TRPV1), we investigated the role of TRPV1 in plasma extravasation in the trachea and bronchi of rats treated with the ACEI captopril. We observed that intravenous (i.v.) administration of captopril did not cause plasma extravasation in the trachea or bronchi of spontaneously breathing rats, but induced plasma extravasation in the trachea and bronchi of artificially ventilated rats. The intratracheal (i.t.) instillation of capsaicin or bradykinin also induced an increase in plasma extravasation in the trachea and bronchi of artificially ventilated rats. As expected, capsaicin-induced plasma extravasation was inhibited by i.t. pretreatment with the TRPV1 selective antagonist capsazepine (CPZ) while bradykinin-induced plasma extravasation was reduced by i.t. pretreatment with the selective B2 receptor antagonist Icatibant, originally known as HOE 140 (HOE). Interestingly, bradykinin-induced plasma extravasation was also inhibited by CPZ. The pretreatment with HOE and CPZ, singly or in combination and at doses which do not cause inhibitory effects per se, significantly inhibited the plasma extravasation induced by captopril treatment in artificially ventilated rats. In addition, treatment with a high dose of capsaicin in newborn rats, which induces degeneration of TRPV1-expressing sensory neurons, abolished both capsaicin and captopril-induced plasma extravasation in artificially ventilated rats. In conclusion, our study identified that captopril treatment promoted sensitisation of TRPV1, via B2 receptor activation, inducing plasma extravasation in the airways of mechanically ventilated rats. The present findings add a new view about the role of TRPV1 in the plasma extravasation induced by captopril and could to contribute to the elucidation of mechanisms by which ACEI induces adverse effects on airways.",

By means of multivariate linear regression analysis, we found that age (\u03b2 coefficient: 7.77; P: 0.01) was significantly associated with ACE activities. However, ACE activities were found to be significantly negatively associated with measures of orientation and immediate recall among the AD patients (r<0, P<0.05), whereas ACE activities were not associated with any MMSE scores among the non-AD groups (P > 0.05).uuuu CONCLUSIONS: ACE serum activity that correlates with age is likely to constitute a potential risk factor for the development of AD. ACE serum activity might be a useful biomarker for disease status with increasingly high ACE from mild stage to moderate-severe stage. Moreover, patients with aMCI could take ACE inhibitor (ACEI) to decrease the incidence of AD, and patients with AD could take ACEI to retard cognitive decline in early AD.",

Despite the significant difference in the achieved SBP, there was no significant difference in the incidence of primary outcomes. Based on this evidence, the target SBP for diabetics has been revised in the majority of major guidelines. However, there is a steeper association between SBP and stroke in Asians than other ethnicities, with stroke being the leading cause of cardiovascular mortality. This suggests that target BP in the Asian region should be tailored towards prevention of stroke. In the ACCORD study, the intensive BP treatment was associated with significant reductions in both total stroke and non-fatal stroke. The results from the ACCORD study are supported by a subgroup analysis from the ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET) study, which showed that, in diabetic patients, the risk of stroke continues to decrease to a SBP value of 115 mm Hg with no evidence of J curve. As diabetes is highly associated with underlying coronary artery disease, there is a justified concern for adverse effects resulting from too much lowering of BP. In a post hoc analysis of 6400 diabetic subjects enrolled in the International Verapamil SR-Trandolapril (INVEST) study, subjects with SBP of less than 110 mm Hg were associated with a significant increase in all-cause mortality. In the ONTARGET study, at any levels of achieved SBP, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) below 67 mm Hg was associated with increased risk for cardiovascular outcomes. As such, a prudent approach would be to target a SBP of 130-140 mm Hg and DBP of above 60 mm Hg in diabetics with coronary artery disease. In conclusion, hypertension, in association with diabetes, has been found to be significantly correlated with an elevated risk for cardiovascular events. As the association between stroke and BP is stronger in Asians, compared to other ethnicities, consideration should be given for a target BP of 130/80 mm Hg in Asians.",

These types of drugs are commonly administered together. More recently, angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) antagonists, such as candesartan cilexetil (candesartan), have been used in the place of, or in combination with, ACEis. Here, we investigated the effects of simvastatin and ramipril single and combination therapy, and candesartan treatment on the lifespan of isocalorically fed, long-lived, B6C3F1 mice. Males were used for their relative endocrine simplicity and to minimize animal usage. The drugs were administered daily in food. The simvastatin and ramipril combination therapy significantly increased the mean and median lifespan by 9\u00a0%. In contrast, simvastatin, ramipril, or candesartan monotherapy was ineffective. All groups consumed the same number of calories. Simvastatin, alone or administered with ramipril, decreased body weight without changing caloric consumption, suggesting it may alter energy utilization in mice. Combination therapy elevated serum triglyceride and glucose levels, consistent with altered energy homeostasis. Few significant or consistent differences were found in mortality-associated pathologies among the groups. Simvastatin treatment did not reduce normal serum cholesterol or lipid levels in these mice, suggesting that the longevity effects may stem from the pleiotropic, non-cholesterol-related, effects of statins. Together, the results suggest that statins and ACEis together may enhance mouse longevity. Statins and ACE inhibitors are generally well-tolerated, and in combination, they have been shown to increase the lifespan of normotensive, normocholesterolemic humans.",

Arterial stiffening occurs with aging and results in a pattern of increased systolic and decreased diastolic blood pressure (BP). In the elderly population, elevated BP has been related with increased cardiovascular risk. Trials on this population have shown great benefits for morbidity and mortality from reducing systolic BP (SBP) levels to less than 150 mmHg. Most guidelines for the management of elderly hypertensive patients agree on BP reduction to less than 150/90 mmHg.

The recently published SPRINT trial demonstrated that reducing SBP to between 120 and 125 mmHg in patients over the age of 75 years is related with increased survival and is expected to affect future recommendations. On the contrary, the limited data that are available for octogenarians and frail nursing home patients create concerns for more aggressive BP strategies in these subgroups, and thus they should be treated more conservatively. Among the various antihypertensive classes of drugs, diuretics, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers were proved beneficial in the elderly and are favored as first choices for the management of elderly hypertensive individuals.

Accumulating literature has revealed that ACE inhibitors may exert beneficial effect in several disease models via preventing PARP activation. Based on this hypothesis, we have evaluated the renoprotective effect of enalapril, an ACE inhibitor, and its underlying mechanism(s) in cisplatin-induced renal injury in rats. Male Albino Wistar rats were orally administered normal saline or enalapril (10, 20 and 40\u2009mg/kg) for 10 days. Nephrotoxicity was induced by a single dose of cisplatin (8\u2009mg/kg; i.p.) on the 7th day. The animals were thereafter sacrificed on the 11th day and both the kidneys were excised and processed for biochemical, histopathological, molecular, and immunohistochemical studies. Enalapril (40\u2009mg/kg) significantly prevented cisplatin-induced renal dysfunction. In comparison to cisplatin-treated group, the elevation of BUN and creatinine levels was significantly less in this group. This improvement in kidney injury markers was well substantiated with reduced PARP expression along with phosphorylation of MAPKs including JNK/ERK/p38. Enalapril, in a dose-dependent fashion, attenuated cisplatin-induced oxidative stress as evidenced by augmented GSH, SOD and catalase activities, reduced TBARS and oxidative DNA damage (8-OHDG), and Nox-4 protein expression. Moreover, enalapril dose dependently inhibited cisplatin-induced inflammation (NF-\u03baB/IKK-\u03b2/IL-6/Cox-2/TNF-\u03b1 expressions), apoptosis (increased Bcl-2 and reduced p53, cytochrome c, Bax and caspase-3 expressions, and TUNEL/DAPI positivity) and preserved the structural integrity of the kidney.

All components of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) have also been identified in the brain. In addition to cytokines, neuromodulators such as ANG II can induce neuroinflammation. Moreover, in Alzheimer's disease (AD) models, where neuroinflammation occurs and is thought to contribute to the propagation of the disease, increased levels of ANG II and ACE have been detected. However, the specific effect of ACEIs on neuroinflammation and AD remains obscure. The present study suggests that captopril and perindopril, centrally active ACEIs, may serve as modulators for microglial activation associated with AD. Our in vitro study investigated the effect of both ACEIs on nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor- \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) release and inducible NO synthase (iNOS) expression in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced BV2 microglia. Exposure of BV2 microglia to ACEIs significantly attenuated the LPS-induced NO and TNF-\u03b1 release. In vivo, short term intranasal administration of perindopril or captopril to 5 Familial AD (5XFAD) mice significantly reduced amyloid burden and CD11b expression (a microglial marker) or only CD11b expression respectively, in the cortex of 5XFAD. Long-term intranasal administration of captopril to mice reduced amyloid burden with no effect on CD11b expression. We provide evidence that intranasal delivery of ACEI may serve as an efficient alternative for their systemic administration, as it results in the attenuation of microglial accumulation and even the reduction of\u00a0Amyloid\u00a0\u03b2 (A\u03b2) plaques.",

Then the effect of okara extract on angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) activity was examined in vitro, and the extract was shown to cause the inhibition of ACE activity in a manner depending on its concentration. Kinetic analysis indicated that this enzyme inhibition was accompanied by an increase in the Km value without any change in Vmax. Further studies suggested that putative inhibitory substances contained in the extract might be heat stable and dialyzable, and recovered mostly in the peptide fraction obtained by a spin-column separation and a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) fractionation.

The achievement of OMT was defined as control of blood pressure <130/80\u00a0mm Hg, hemoglobin A1c <7.0%, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol <100\u00a0mg/dl. The primary end point was target vessel failure, a composite of death related to the target vessel, myocardial infarction, or clinically driven revascularization at 24\u00a0months after stent implantation. Immediately before the procedure, only 548 patients (18.2%) had achieved all 3 target criteria (the achieved OMT group), whereas the remaining 2,456 patients failed to achieve one or more criteria (the non-OMT group). At 24\u00a0months, the incidence of target vessel failure was 7.0% in the achieved OMT group versus 10.0% in the non-OMT group (hazard ratio 0.68, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.96, p\u00a0= 0.03). The incidence of non-Q-wave myocardial infarction was also lower in the achieved OMT group than in the non-OMT group (0.5% vs 1.5%, p\u00a0= 0.08). Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified that hemoglobin A1c <7.0% was the only protective predictor of 24-month target vessel failure (odds ratio 0.56, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.73, p <0.01). In conclusion, this study demonstrated that in patients with stable CAD scheduled for stent implantation, achievement of OMT before percutaneous coronary intervention significantly reduced subsequent cardiac events. Achievement of OMT is still insufficient in modern clinical practice.", 
    "669": "The peptidase from the viscera of farmed giant catfish was used for producing gelatin hydrolysates (HG) and compared with those produced from commercial bovine trypsin (HB). The degree of hydrolysis (DH) observed suggests that proteolytic cleavage rapidly occurred within the first 120min of incubation, and there was higher DH in HG than in HB. HG demonstrated the highest ACE-inhibitory activity, DPPH, ABTS radical scavenging activity, and FRAP. HB showed the highest FRAP activity. The DPPH radical scavenging activity of HG was quite stable over the pH range of 1-11, but it increased slightly when the heating duration time reached 240min at 100\u00b0C. The ACE-inhibitory activity of HG showed the highest stability at a pH of 7, and it remained very stable at 100\u00b0C for over 15-240min. The visceral peptidase from farmed giant catfish could be an alternative protease for generating protein hydrolysates with desirable bioactivities. The resulting hydrolysates showed good stability, making them potential functional ingredients for food formulations.",

    "671": "Functional mitral regurgitation is a form of valve insufficiency in the presence of anatomically normal mitral valve. The cause of functional mitral regurgitation is left ventricular remodelling that tethers valve leaflet more apically decreasing their coaptation ability. Given the pathophysiologic relation between functional mitral regurgitation and ventricular dysfunction, the valve insufficiency has long been considered a surrogate of ventricular disease. Accordingly, all potential therapeutic strategies able to decrease functional mitral regurgitation have been associated with improved ventricular function. On the contrary, the surgical treatment of functional mitral regurgitation has led to contrasting results, but the main drawback is that it does not improve survival compared with medical therapy. However, surgery is characterized by many confounding factors, which might conceal the beneficial effect of the treatment of valve dysfunction in the mid-long-term follow-up. The present review underscores the potential limits of surgical treatment and hypothesized that percutaneous treatment of functional mitral regurgitation, by means of MitraClip, Abbott, Menlo Park, California, might represent a better tool to investigate treatment of functional mitral regurgitation.",

Whether different ACE-inhibitors have distinct kidney protective effects is unknown; it is therefore hypothesized that renal diets and enalapril or benazepril have different beneficial effects in proteinuric CKD dogs. Forty-four dogs with proteinuric CKD (IRIS stages 1-4) were enrolled in the study and were fed renal diet for 30 days. Thereafter, they were randomly assigned to one of 2 groups. Dogs in group A (n=22) received enalapril (0.5 mg/kg, q12h) and in group B (n=22) benazepril (0.5 mg/kg, q24h); in both groups, dogs were fed the same renal diet. After randomization, dogs were monitored for 120 days. Body weight and body condition score (BCS), serum concentrations of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), albumin and total proteins, and urine protein-to-creatinine (UPC) ratio were compared at different time-points. After 30 days of renal diet, creatinine, BUN and UPC ratio decreased significantly (p<0.0001). Compared to randomization, body weight, BCS, albumin, total proteins, creatinine and BUN did not vary during follow-up in the 44 dogs and differences between group A and B were not observed. However, the UPC ratio of group A at day 60, 90 and 150 was significantly lower than in group B and compared to randomization (p<0.05). In group B it did not vary overtime. It is concluded that the renal diet is beneficial to decrease creatinine, BUN and UPC ratio in proteinuric CKD dogs. Enalapril further ameliorates proteinuria if administered along with renal diet.",

However, there is a gap in evidence, and very few data come from randomized and adequately powered studies. Some evidence supports the use of \u03b2-blockers, in particular with a short half-life, in the case of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in secondary prevention.

Cardiovascular disease and COPD association is increasing overtime. Several registries clearly showed a negative impact on the clinical outcome of the concomitant presence of CVD and COPD. Patients with CVD and COPD present an increased risk for myocardial infarction, HF, and hospital admission for acute exacerbation of COPD, with a negative impact on prognosis. To reduce the effect of this negative association, it is of paramount importance the pharmacological treatment with both cardiovascular and respiratory drugs, according to current guidelines. Nevertheless, several registries and studies showed that evidence-based drugs (both cardiovascular and respiratory) are often under administered in this subset of patients. In this overview, we summarize the available data regarding the use of cardiovascular drugs (antiplatelet agents, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, \u03b2-blockers, and statins) in COPD patients, with or without concomitant IHD.

The renin inhibitor aliskiren was recently shown to increase cardiac tissue kallikrein expression and bradykinin levels, and to reduce myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury by bradykinin B2 receptor- and angiotensin AT2 receptor-mediated mechanisms.

Many elderly patients, diagnosed with multiple medical conditions (such as cardiovascular diseases, Type 2 diabetes mellitus, and cerebrovascular diseases) are at increased risk of the development of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), AD, and vascular dementia. Studies have revealed reduced rates of cognitive decline, in elderly patients, who were treated with centrally active angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) (that have an ability to cross the blood-brain barrier). This article reviews recently published literature, focused on possible protective influence of the centrally active ACE-Is, in the elderly population, at risk for cognitive decline.",

There is a delay in the development of vascular smooth muscle in the late postnatal period in rats with the blockade of the sympathetic nervous system in the prenatal period.

Despite the success of novel drugs in animal models, the majority of the subsequent clinical trials employing those drugs targeting diabetic nephropathy failed. This lack of translational value may in part be due to an inadequate comparability of human disease and animal models that often capture only a few aspects of disease. Here we overcome this limitation by developing a multimolecular noninvasive humanized readout of diabetic nephropathy based on urinary peptidomics. The disease-modified urinary peptides of 2 type 2 diabetic nephropathy mouse models were identified and compared with previously validated urinary peptide markers of diabetic nephropathy in humans to generate a classifier composed of 21 ortholog peptides. This classifier predicted the response to disease and treatment with inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system in mice. The humanized classifier was significantly correlated with glomerular lesions. Using a human type 2 diabetic validation cohort of 207 patients, the classifier also distinguished between patients with and without diabetic nephropathy, and their response to renin-angiotensin system inhibition. Thus, a combination of multiple molecular features common to both human and murine disease could provide a significant change in translational drug discovery research in type 2 diabetic nephropathy.",

Treatment of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) (costing US$1000-US$7530 per DALY averted) and secondary prevention of IHD and stroke (costing US$1060-US$10,340 per DALY averted) become more efficient when delivered in integrated packages. At an annual willingness-to-pay (WTP) level of about US$3 million, a package consisting of aspirin, streptokinase, ACE-inhibitor and beta-blocker for AMI has the highest probability of being most cost-effective, whereas as WTP increases to\u00a0>\u00a0US$7 million, combination drug treatment to individuals having\u00a0>35\u00a0% absolute risk stands out as the most cost-effective strategy.

Nevertheless, although sacubitril/valsartan has been available in the USA for a year, uptake of the drug by practitioners has been slow, in part because of misconceptions about the pivotal trial that demonstrated its efficacy in heart failure (PARADIGM-HF). This review addresses questions that have been raised in the USA about the design of the trial as well as the patients who were studied, the replicability and applicability of the results, and the safety of neprilysin inhibition. The totality of evidence indicates that the PARADIGM-HF trial used an appropriate comparator; enrolled patients typical of those seen in the community with mild to moderate symptoms; yielded highly persuasive and replicable results; and demonstrated benefits that are applicable to patients taking subtarget doses of ACE inhibitors and ARBs. Regulatory review in the USA concluded that the established advantages of sacubitril/valsartan on cardiovascular death and disease progression outweighed hypothetical uncertainties about the long-term effects of neprilysin inhibition in patients who might not have survived without the drug.

IW was effective both in ECs and SMCs, as well as in isolated aorta. Similarly, captopril (CA) inhibited ANGI-induced MMP2 protein expression in both in vitro and ex vivo. Neither IW nor CA inhibited ANGII-induced MMP2 protein expression in contrast to losartan. The data also displays that removal of endothelium in isolated rat aorta abolished the endothelium-dependent relaxation induced with acetylcholine. However, SMC-dependent relaxation induced with sodium nitroprusside remained intact. Finally, the data provides histological evidence of selective removal of endothelial cells from aorta.", 
    "716": "Background The therapeutic reference pricing (TRP) in Slovenia was implemented for proton pump inhibitors in 2013 and for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and lipid-lowering medicines in 2014. Objective The study aimed to assess patients' knowledge and attitude towards the TRP system. Moreover, the patients' willingness to pay was evaluated for patients who rejected the substitution of a current medicine within a therapeutic class by the reference medicine for which no co-payment is needed. Setting Invitation of patients to participate in a survey and filling in the first part of the questionnaire was run in the community pharmacies in Slovenia. The second part of the questionnaire was filled in at patients' home. Method A representative sample of 676 patients that had been prescribed at least one medicine from the three therapeutic classes was surveyed. The survey was carried out from 15th May to 15th June 2014 in 40 community pharmacies with the help of the pharmacists, who filled in the first part of the questionnaire in the presence of the patients. The second part of the questionnaire was filled in by 475 patients at home and returned by prepaid mail. Main outcome measure Patients' knowledge of and attitude to the TRP system implemented into Slovenian health care practice. Results Most of the statements describing patient' rights and duties within the TRP system were known by approximately 50\u00a0% of the patients. Patients were inhomogeneous in their view about the necessity and benefits of the TRP system, most of them regarded it as an unnecessary burden. Among 50.4\u00a0% of the patients who were required to copay for their medicine, 46.7\u00a0% accepted and 3.7\u00a0% rejected co-payment. The average co-payment was \u20ac 6.92, while the expressed average willingness to co-pay was \u20ac 10.4 per 3\u00a0months of therapy. Conclusion Our results indicate that the implementation of the TRP system and potential upgrades represent a significant challenge for the patients.",

Multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics, was used to examine the association between annual AMI volume and adherence to each measure. Similar modeling was used to evaluate the relationship between AMI volume and in-hospital mortality. Compared with high-volume hospitals, lower-volume hospitals were less likely to be academically affiliated, or to have cardiac surgery capabilities, electronic health records, or dedicated tobacco treatment services. Higher-volume hospitals had greater adherence to each performance measure, except aspirin use at arrival and reperfusion therapy. The greatest difference was in the rates of referral to cardiac rehabilitation (59%, 76%, and 83% in low-, middle-, and high-volume hospitals, respectively). After multivariable adjustment, higher AMI volume (up to 400 AMI patients/y) remained associated with higher-performance measure adherence.

    "731": "In this work, a novel biosensor based on electrochemically reduced graphene oxide and iridium oxide nanoparticles for the detection of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor drug, captopril, is presented. For the preparation of the biosensor, tyrosinase is immobilized onto screen printed electrode by using 1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide and N-Hydroxysuccinimide coupling reagents, in electrochemically reduced graphene oxide and iridium oxide nanoparticles matrix. Biosensor response is characterized towards catechol, in terms of graphene oxide concentration, number of cycles to reduce graphene oxide, volume of iridium oxide nanoparticles and tyrosinase solution. The designed biosensor is used to inhibit tyrosinase activity by Captopril, which is generally used to treat congestive heart failure. It is an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor that operates via chelating copper at the active site of tyrosinase and thioquinone formation. The captopril detections using both inhibition ways are very sensitive with low limits of detection: 0.019\u00b5M and 0.008\u00b5M for chelating copper at the active site of tyrosinase and thioquinone formation, respectively.

    "740": "Chronic allograft fibrosis is the major cause of graft loss in kidney transplantation. Progression can only be reduced by inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). We tested the hypothesis that the protection provided by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition also decreases capillary rarefaction, lymphangiogenesis, and podocyte injury in allograft fibrosis. Fisher kidneys were transplanted into bilaterally nephrectomized Lewis rats treated with enalapril (60 mg/kg per day) (ACE inhibitor, ACEi) or vehicle. Proteinuria, blood urea nitrogen, and plasma creatinine were regularly assessed, and grafts were harvested for morphological and immunohistological analysis at various times up to 32 wk. In the vehicle group, many new lymphatic capillaries and severe and diffuse mononuclear infiltration of allografts were observed already 1 wk after transplantation. Lymphangiogenesis increased until week 4, by which time inflammatory infiltration became focal. Lymphatic capillaries were often located at sites of inflammation. Progressive interstitial fibrosis, glomerulosclerosis, capillary rarefaction, and proteinuria appeared later, at weeks 4-12 The number of lymphatic capillary cross sections strongly correlated with the interstitial fibrosis score. Podoplanin immunostaining, a marker of healthy podocytes, disappeared from inflamed or sclerotic glomerular areas. ACEi protected from lymphangiogenesis and associated inflammation, preserved glomerular podoplanin protein expression, and reduced glomerulosclerosis, proteinuria, tubulointerstitial fibrosis, and blood capillary rarefaction at 32 wk. In conclusion, ACEi considerably decreased and/or delayed both glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial injury. Prevention of glomerular podoplanin loss and proteinuria could be attributed to the known intraglomerular pressure-lowering effects of ACEi. Reduction of lymphangiogenesis could contribute to amelioration of tubulointerstitial fibrosis and inflammatory infiltration after ACEi.",

Renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin receptor antagonists (ARAs), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and diuretics, are highly prescribed drugs that are frequently administered together. Double and triple associations have been correlated with increased pre-renal AKI incidence, termed \"double whammy\" and \"triple whammy\", respectively. This article presents an integrative analysis of the complex interplay among the effects of NSAIDs, ACEIs/ARAs and diuretics, acting alone and together in double and triple therapies. In addition, we explore how these drug combinations alter the equilibrium of regulatory mechanisms controlling blood pressure (renal perfusion pressure) and GFR to increase the odds of inducing AKI through the concomitant reduction of blood pressure and distortion of renal autoregulation. Using this knowledge, we propose a more general model of pre-renal AKI based on a multi whammy model, whereby several factors are necessary to effectively reduce net filtration. The triple whammy was the only model associated with pre-renal AKI accompanied by a course of other risk factors, among numerous potential combinations of clinical circumstances causing hypoperfusion in which renal autoregulation is not operative or is deregulated. These factors would uncouple the normal BP-GFR relationship, where lower GFR values are obtained at every BP value.",

Herein, we have investigated the effects of T. majus extract (HETM) on fetal development, evaluating its relationship with possible ACE inhibitory activity. Pregnant Wistar rats were treated with different HETM doses (3, 30 and 300\u2009mg/kg/day) from gestational days 8-20.

All pregnant rats treated with high HETM doses showed significant reduction in plasma ACE activity accompanied by a decrease in serum aldosterone levels. Moreover, significant changes in fetal development were observed, including growth retardation and renal damage after 20 days of gestation. Thus, data presented demonstrate the significant effects of the use of HETM on fetal development during pregnancy.",

However, women exhibit a greater symptom burden, more functional disability, and a higher prevalence of nonobstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) compared to men when evaluated for signs and symptoms of myocardial ischemia. This paradoxical sex difference appears to be linked to a sex-specific pathophysiology of myocardial ischemia including coronary microvascular dysfunction, a component of the 'Yentl Syndrome'. Accordingly, the term ischemic heart disease (IHD) is more appropriate for a discussion specific to women rather than CAD or coronary heart disease. Following the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Heart Truth/American Heart Association, Women's Ischemia Syndrome Evaluation and guideline campaigns, the cardiovascular mortality in women has been decreased, although significant gender gaps in clinical outcomes still exist. Women less likely undergo testing, yet guidelines indicate that symptomatic women at intermediate to high IHD risk should have further test (e.g. exercise treadmill test or stress imaging) for myocardial ischemia and prognosis. Further, women have suboptimal use of evidence-based guideline therapies compared with men with and without obstructive CAD. Anti-anginal and anti-atherosclerotic strategies are effective for symptom and ischemia management in women with evidence of ischemia and nonobstructive CAD, although more female-specific study is needed. IHD guidelines are not \"cardiac catheterization\" based but related to evidence of \"myocardial ischemia and angina\". A simplified approach to IHD management with ABCs (aspirin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin-renin blockers, beta blockers, cholesterol management and statin) should be used and can help to increases adherence to guidelines.",

Higher ACE inhibitory activity was also observed in the sausages fermented with strain no. 28, but did not differ significantly from those with the type strain. An analysis of the proteolysis and degradation products formed by each LAB in sausages suggested that those bioactivities yielded fermentation products such as peptides.

Ten studies that assessed the relationship between RASB use and the incidence of cognitive impairment of aging or AD were included. When randomized trials and observational studies were combined, the use of RASB was significantly associated with a reduced risk of AD (risk ratio [RR], 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.68-0.92) and cognitive impairment of aging (RR, 0.65; 95% CI 0.35-0.94) compared no use of RASB.

In conclusion, RASB treatments, regardless of the drug class, have benefits on prevention of AD, and the effects of ACEI may analogous to ARB. However, the benefit differs according to drug classes for cognitive impairment of aging, with ARB use, rather than ACEI use, being a potential treatment for reducing the incidence of cognitive impairment of aging.",

Therefore, influence of captopril (an ACE inhibitor) on acetylcholine (ACh)-induced bronchial smooth muscle contractions was investigated. Further, the mechanisms underlying the captopril-induced changes were also explored. In vitro contractions of rat bronchial smooth muscle to cumulative concentrations of ACh were recorded before and after exposure to captopril. Further, the involvement of kinin and inositol triphosphate (IP\u2083) pathways for captopril-induced alterations were explored. ACh produced concentration-dependent (5-500 \u00b5M) increase in bronchial smooth muscle contractions. Pre-treatment with captopril augmented the ACh-induced contractions at each concentration significantly. Pre-treatment with aprotinin (kinin synthesis inhibitor) or heparin (inositol triphosphate, IP\u2083-inhibitor), blocked the captopril-induced augmentation of bronchial smooth muscle contractions evoked by ACh. Further, captopril-induced augmentation was absent in calcium-free medium. These results suggest that captopril sensitizes bronchial smooth muscles to ACh-induced contractions.

The rate of (125)I-Ang II formation from (125)I-Ang-(1-12) by chymase was significantly higher (heart: 7.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.6\u00a0fmol/min/mg; lung: 33\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2\u00a0fmol/min/mg, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) when compared to (125)I-Ang I substrate (heart: 0.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1\u00a0fmol/min/mg; lung: 2.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1\u00a0fmol/min/mg). Substrate affinity of (125)I-Ang-(1-12) for rat cardiac chymase was also confirmed using excess unlabeled Ang-(1-12) or Ang I (0-250\u00a0\u03bcM). The rate of (125)I-Ang II formation was significantly lower using unlabeled Ang-(1-12) compared to unlabeled Ang I substrate. Kinetic data showed that rat chymase has a lower Km (64\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.3\u00a0\u03bcM vs 142\u00a0\u00b1\u00a017\u00a0\u03bcM), higher Vmax (13.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.3\u00a0\u03bcM/min/mg vs 1.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u00a0\u03bcM/min/mg) and more than 15-fold higher catalytic efficiency (ratio of Vmax/Km) for Ang-(1-12) compared to Ang I substrate, respectively. We also investigated ACE mediated hydrolysis of (125)I-Ang-(1-12) and (125)I-Ang I in solubilized membrane fractions of the SHR heart and lung. Interestingly, no significant difference in (125)I-Ang II formation by ACE was detected using either substrate, (125)I-Ang-(1-12) or (125)I-Ang I, both in the heart (1.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u00a0fmol/min/mg and 1.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0fmol/min/mg, respectively) and in the lungs (239\u00a0\u00b1\u00a025\u00a0fmol/min/mg and 248\u00a0\u00b1\u00a034\u00a0fmol/min/mg, respectively). Compared to chymase, ACE-mediated Ang-(1-12) metabolism in the heart was several fold lower. Overall our findings suggest that Ang-(1-12), not Ang I, is the better substrate for Ang II formation by chymase in adult rats. In addition, this confirms our previous observation that chymase (rather than ACE) is the main hydrolyzing enzyme responsible for Ang II generation from Ang-(1-12) in the adult rat heart.",

This study investigated the protective effect of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril on postresuscitation hemodynamics, in a porcine model of cardiac arrest established by APE. Twenty-nine Beijing Landrace pigs were infused with an autologous thrombus leading to cardiac arrest and subjected to standard cardiopulmonary resuscitation and thrombolysis. Ten resuscitated pigs were randomly and equally apportioned to receive either captopril (22.22\u00a0mg/kg) infusion or the same volume saline, 30\u00a0min after ROSC. Hemodynamic changes and ACE-Ang II-angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) and ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas receptor axis levels were determined. APE was associated with a decline in mean arterial pressure and a dramatic increase in pulmonary artery pressure and mean right ventricular pressure. After ROSC, captopril infusion was associated with significantly lower mean right ventricular pressure and systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance, faster heart rate, and higher Ang-(1-7) levels, ACE2/ACE, and Ang-(1-7)/Ang II, compared with the saline infusion. The ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas pathway correlated negatively with external vascular lung water and pulmonary vascular permeability and positively with the right cardiac index. In conclusion, in a pig model of APE leading to cardiac arrest, captopril infusion was associated with less mean right ventricular pressure overload after resuscitation, compared with saline infusion. The reduction in systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance associated with captopril may be by inhibiting the ACE-Ang II-AT1R axis and activating the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis.",

According to the current subject knowledge, there are two main axes of the RAAS: (1) angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-angiotensin II-AT1 receptor axis and (2) ACE2-angiotensin-(1-7)-Mas receptor axis. The activation of the first axis leads to deleterious effects, including vasoconstriction, endothelial dysfunction, thrombosis, inflammation, and fibrosis; therefore, blocking the components of this axis is a highly rational and commonly used therapeutic procedure. The ACE2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas receptor axis has a different role, since it often opposes the effects induced by the classical ACE-Ang II-AT1 axis. Once the positive effects of the ACE2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas axis were discovered, the alternative ways of pharmacotherapy activating this axis of RAAS appeared. This article briefly describes new molecules affecting the RAAS, namely: recombinant human ACE2, ACE2 activators, angiotensin-(1-7) peptide and non-peptide analogs, aldosterone synthase inhibitors, and the third and fourth generation of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists.

An antagonist of glutamate, kynurenic acid (KYNA) was shown to decrease blood pressure after intracerebral administration. KYNA is an endogenous metabolite of tryptophan produced from the breakdown of kynurenine by kynurenine aminotransferases (KAT), mainly within astrocytes. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of three angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (lisinopril, perindopril and ramipril) on KYNA production and KAT activity in the rat brain cortex in vitro. The effect of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors on KYNA production was examined on rat brain cortical slices incubated for 2h in the presence of l-kynurenine and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. To analyze KAT I and KAT II activity, brain cortical homogenates were incubated for 2h with L-kynurenine and the tested drugs. KYNA was separated by HPLC and quantified fluorometrically. Among the examined angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, lisinopril increased KYNA production, perindopril was ineffective, and ramipril decreased KYNA synthesis in rat brain cortical slices. Lisinopril increased KAT I activity and perindopril did not affect it. However, ramipril lowered KAT I activity in rat brain cortex in vitro. Neither lisinopril nor perindopril affected KAT II activity, but ramipril decreased KAT II activity in the rat brain cortex in vitro. Our study reveals that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors show various influences on KYNA production in rat brain cortical slices and activity of KATs.", 
    "905": "Aging impairs endothelium-dependent NO-mediated dilatation, which results from increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The local generation of angiotensin II (ANG II) is increased in aging arteries and contributes to inflammatory and fibrotic activity of smooth muscle cells and arterial wall remodeling. Although prolonged in vivo ANG II inhibition improves the impaired endothelial dilatation of aging arteries, it is unclear whether this reflects inhibition of intravascular or systemic ANG II systems. Experiments were therefore performed on isolated tail arteries from young (3-4 mo) and old (22-24 mo) F344 rats to determine if a local renin-angiotensin system contributes to the endothelial dilator dysfunction of aging. Aging impaired dilatation to the endothelial agonist acetylcholine but did not influence responses to a nitric oxide (NO) donor (DEA NONOate). Dilatation to acetylcholine was greatly reduced by NO synthase inhibition [nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME)] in young and old arteries. In isolated arteries, acute inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) (perindoprilat), renin (aliskiren), or AT1 receptors (valsartan, losartan) did not influence dilatation to acetylcholine in young arteries but increased responses in old arteries. After ANG II inhibition, the dilator response to acetylcholine was similar in young and old arteries. ROS activity, which was increased in endothelium of aging arteries, was also reduced by inhibiting ANG II (perindoprilat, losartan). Renin expression was increased by 5.6 fold and immunofluorescent levels of ANG II were confirmed to be increased in aging compared with young arteries. Exogenous ANG II inhibited acetylcholine-induced dilatation. Therefore, aging-induced impairment of endothelium-dependent dilatation in aging is caused by a local intravascular renin-angiotensin system.",

Higher activity remained in pasta with PLH than VUH after extrusion, and higher the level of addition, higher the ACEI was. Pasta had practically the same ACEI activity after cooking, thus active compounds were not lost by temperature or lixiviation. Regarding TEAC, higher activity remained in pasta with 10\u00a0% VUH (31.84\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.17\u00a0\u03bcmol Trolox/g). Other samples with hydrolyzates had the same activity. After cooking, pasta with hydrolyzates had higher TEAC values than control, but these were not modified by the level of incorporation.

We hypothesized that NT-pro-BNP, in combination with other clinical factors in terms of a novel NT-pro BNP-based score, may provide even better predictive power for in-hospital mortality among patients with HF. A retrospective study enrolled adult patients with hospitalization-requiring HF who fulfilled the predefined criteria during the period from January 2011 to December 2013. We proposed a novel scoring system consisting of several independent predictors including NT-pro-BNP for predicting in-hospital mortality, and then compared the prognosis-predictive power of the novel NT-pro BNP-based score with other prognosis-predictive scores. A total of 269 patients were enrolled in the current study. Factors such as \"serum NT-pro-BNP level above 8100\u2009mg/dl,\" \"age above 79 years,\" \"without taking angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blocker,\" \"without taking beta-blocker,\" \"without taking loop diuretics,\" \"with mechanical ventilator support,\" \"with non-invasive ventilator support,\" \"with vasopressors use,\" and \"experience of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation\" were found as independent predictors. A novel NT-pro BNP-based score composed of these risk factors was proposed with excellent predictability for in-hospital mortality. The proposed novel NT-pro BNP-based score was extremely effective in predicting in-hospital mortality in HF patients.",

The effects of ACE inhibitors on the production of cytokines and T-cell functions are well established. However, little is known on the effects of these medicines on humoral response to foreign antigens. In this study, we investigated the effect of enalapril treatment on ovalbumin (OVA)-specific IgG1 and IgG2c production in mice determined by ELISA. Two groups of 8-week-old C57BL/6 females mice (3-4/group) were subcutaneously immunized with OVA (10 \u03bcg/animal) in presence of Alhydrogel (1 mg/mouse) and boosted at day 21. The mice were treated with enalapril (5 mg/kg daily, po) or were left without treatment for one month. The animals were bled from the orbital plexus on days 0, 7, 14, 21, and 28 after the first immunization and the sera were stored at -20\u00b0C until usage. OVA-specific serum IgG1 and IgG2c were determined by ELISA using serum from each individual animal. The results showed that enalapril significantly increased anti-OVA serum IgG2c in the secondary response without affecting IgG1 synthesis.

    "986": "Treatment-resistant hypertension (TRH) is defined as elevated blood pressure despite treatment with three properly dosed antihypertensive drugs, and is associated with adverse cardiovascular and renal outcomes and increased mortality. Treatment of patients with TRH focuses on maximizing the doses of antihypertensive drugs and adding drugs with complementary mechanisms of action, including a combination of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, and thiazide-like diuretics. Randomized clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist spironolactone as a fourth-line therapy for patients with TRH. Other pharmacologic considerations include adding \u03b1-blockers, combined \u03b1-\u03b2-blockers, centrally acting \u03b1-agonists, or direct vasodilators. However, a small, but important subset of patients remain hypertensive despite combination regimens with multiple antihypertensive drugs, underscoring the need for novel blood pressure-lowering therapies. Over recent years, alternative approaches for treating TRH have emerged, including agonists of natriuretic peptides, endothelin-receptor antagonists, and additional vasoactive drugs. Lastly, device-based interventions, such as renal denervation or carotid baroreflex activation, may supplement drug therapy for these patients.

Dialysis initiation was associated with a 40% (95% confidence interval, 38% to 43%) lower adjusted level of diuretic use, which continued to decline after ESRD. Three- and four-drug combinations that included a diuretic were most common before ESRD, whereas after ESRD, one- and two-drug \u03b2-blocker or calcium-channel blocker-based combinations were most common.",

However, the molecular mechanism underlying the detrimental effects of MMP-9 in HSE has not been elucidated. Recent research finds angiotensin II plays an important role in regulation of MMP-9 activity. The aim of this work was to identify the influence of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) captopril on MMP-9 activation after herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infection.", 
    "1045": "Animal models of HSE were established by intracerebral inoculation of HSV-1 into mice. Brain tissue ROS levels were measured by staining with dihydroethidium. MMP-9 protein expression was detected by immunofluorescence and brain water content was measured with dry-wet weight method. Neurological function score was quantified 5 d after HSV-1 infection. Microglial cells were treated with various concentrations of captopril. MMP-9 gelatinolytic activity in the supematant of the cell cultures was assessed by zymography. RT-PCR was used to detect the mRNA expressions of p47phox and MMP-9.",

Quantification of gelatinolytic activity by densitometry showed that expression of MMP-9 in microglia was significantly increased after HSV-1 infection and inhibited by captopril treatment. NADPH oxidase subunit p47phox and MMP-9 mRNA expression were significantly increased 6\u00a0h after HSV-1 infection, and were seen reduced after captopril treatment in dose dependence. Captopril also downregulated ROS and MMP-9 protein expression following encephalitis in vivo, and attenuated brain edema, and improved neurological function.",

Hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis can replace renal function; kidney transplantation is curative. Prevention of primary manifestations: Allopurinol, febuxostat, or probenecid lowers high serum urate levels effectively and will prevent development of gout. Surveillance: Measurement of serum concentration of creatinine and uric acid at least annually. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Drugs known to be nephrotoxic; volume depletion and dehydration; high meat and seafood intake (may exacerbate hyperuricemia/gout). Evaluation of relatives at risk: If the causative UMOD pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, offer molecular genetic testing to at-risk relatives, particularly: (1) adolescents because of the benefit of allopurinol administration for the prevention of gout; (2) potential kidney donors. Pregnancy management: Allopurinol should be discontinued in women who are pregnant or who may become pregnant.

HF is typified by continuous loss of contractile function with reduced, normal, or preserved ejection fraction, elevated vascular resistance, fluid and autonomic imbalance, and ventricular dilatation. Despite considerable advances in the treatment of HF over the past few decades, mortality remains substantial. Pharmacological treatments including \u03b2-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and aldosterone antagonists have been proven to prolong the survival of patients with HF. However, there are still instances where patients remain symptomatic, despite optimal use of existing therapeutic agents. This understanding that patients with chronic HF progress into advanced stages despite receiving optimal treatment has increased the quest for alternatives, exploring the roles of additional pathways that contribute to the development and progression of HF. Several pharmacological targets associated with pathogenesis of HF have been identified and novel therapies have emerged. In this work, we review recent evidence from proposed mechanisms to the outcomes of experimental and clinical studies of the novel pharmacological agents that have emerged for the treatment of HF.",

Compared to B6 controls, slp-76(ace/ace) mice carrying a missense mutation (Thr428Ile) within the SH2-domain of slp-76 showed an increase in iNKT cells in the thymus and lymph nodes, but a decrease in iNKT cells in spleens and livers, along with reduced ADAP expression and cytokine response. A comparable reduction in iNKT cells was observed in the livers and spleens of ADAP-deficient mice. Like ADAP(-/-) iNKT cells, slp-76(ace/ace) iNKT cells were characterized by enhanced CD11b expression, correlating with an impaired induction of the TCR immediate-early gene Nur77 and a decreased adhesion to ICAM-1. Furthermore, CD11b-intrinsic effects inhibited cytokine release, concanavalin A-mediated inflammation, and iNKT-cell accumulation in the liver. Unlike B6 and ADAP(-/-) mice, the expression of the transcription factors Id3 and PLZF was reduced, whereas NP-1-expression was enhanced in slp-76(ace/ace) mice. Blockade of NP-1 decreased the recovery of iNKT cells from peripheral lymph nodes, identifying NP-1 as an iNKT-cell-specific adhesion factor. Thus, slp-76 contributes to the regulation of the tissue distribution, PLZF, and cytokine expression of iNKT cells via ADAP-dependent and -independent mechanisms.",

The present study aimed to investigate the associated risk factors of delayed CIN and its possible pathogenesis. Subjects with CAG or coronary stenting from January 2008 to December 2009 were studied. A retrospective survey on DKI after CAG was conducted and the risk factors were analyzed. There were 436 cases receiving CAG with complete medical records enrolled in the present cohort, in which the DKI incidence was 7.1% (31/436). Patients with DKI after CAG exhibited lower hemoglobin (121.2\u00b117.3 vs. 133.8\u00b118.6 g/l), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR; 66.4\u00b130.2 vs. 71.9\u00b128.6 ml/min), higher serum creatinine (110.9\u00b143.2 vs. 91.7\u00b137.6 \u00b5mol/l), higher rate of heart failure (22.6 vs. 5.4%) and 300 mg aspirin therapy (29 vs. 5.7%) compared with non-DKI patients (all P<0.05).

Logistic regression revealed that anemia, heart failure and 300 mg aspirin intake were risk factors of DKI (P<0.05), while the contrast level, isotonic contrast, diabetes, ACE inhibitors/ARBs, eGFR and other factors were not associated with DKI (P>0.05). Heart dysfunction and 300 mg aspirin therapy may contribute to DKI after CAG, and iodinated contrast media administration is not a risk factor.",

After an acute coronary syndrome there are short- and long-term risks of subsequent cardiovascular events. This leads to opportunities to initiate strategies to reduce complications resulting from myocardial injury (cardiac protection) and to prevent recurrent acute coronary events (vascular protection). The results from clinical trials inform best practice and guidelines for patient management. Despite clear and consistent guidelines, an important number of patients are not receiving these treatments. Moreover, many others do not receive treatment that follows the strategy proven in the clinical trial and this is associated with a significant loss of opportunities to improve outcomes. The Canadian Heart Research Centre has therefore assembled a panel of experts to provide a review of available data and distill it to specific evidence-based recommendations that can be used by specialists and primary care physicians as a platform for secondary prevention. The therapeutic recommendations are conveniently divided into vascular protection (dual antiplatelet therapy, lipid-lowering, and renin angiotensin system inhibition) which should be considered in all patients; cardiac protection (addition of \u03b2-blocker therapy) in patients with left ventricular dysfunction including consideration for management of heart failure; and continuing management of risk factors and comorbid conditions on the basis of the specific patient profile. These recommendations are intended as a decision support tool and a quick reference for Canadian physicians.",

The primary endpoint of the study was the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which was estimated from the plasma clearance of iohexol. In the absence of furosemide, GFR was significantly higher in cats receiving the combination of benazepril plus robenacoxib compared to the other three groups, and was also significantly higher in females receiving only benazepril compared to the control. Administration of furosemide induced diuresis, reduced GFR and activated the renin-aldosterone-angiotensin system, evidenced from increased plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone concentrations. Compared to the control group in cats treated with furosemide, GFR was increased by benazepril (females only) but decreased by robenacoxib (males only).

    "1082": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a worldwide public health problem associated with a high prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and impaired quality of life. Previous research for preventing loss of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) has focused on reducing blood pressure (BP) and proteinuria. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin II receptor antagonists (ARB) are commonly used in patients with early CKD, but their value in advanced CKD (estimated GFR (eGFR) \u226430 ml/min/1.73 m2) is unknown. There remains a debate about the omission of ACEi/ARB in patients with advanced CKD and their use in association with CVD or heart failure. Does the potential gain in eGFR with ACEi/ARB cessation outweigh the potential adverse cardiovascular outcomes? This paper reviews the current literature that addresses this issue. Several controversies are discussed. Although lowering BP reduces cardiovascular events, evidence suggests that ACEi/ARBs are not superior to other antihypertensive agents. There are no studies assessing the benefits of ACEi/ARB therapy in cardiovascular risk reduction in advanced non-dialysis CKD. The STOP ACEi trial will strengthen the evidence base and shed light on the potential merits and dangers of ACEi/ARB use in advanced CKD on renal function and cardiovascular outcomes.",

    "1086": "Hypertension is a major risk factor for both cerebral infarction and intracerebral hemorrhage. The relationship between blood pressure (BP) and stroke risk is strong and continuous. Throughout the usual range of BPs, including the nonhypertensive range, the higher the BP is, the greater the risk of stroke. Regular BP screening and appropriate treatment of patients with hypertension, including life style modification and pharmacotherapy, are recommended. Patients who have hypertension should be treated with antihypertensive drugs to a target BP of < 140/90 mmHg. Successful reduction of BP is more important in reducing stroke risk than the choice of a specific agent, and treatment should be individualized on the basis of other patient characteristics and medication tolerance. In hypertensive patients with stroke, subjects to be treated with antihypertensive drugs and the target level of BP control are determined on the basis of clinical disease type, interval after onset, severity, age, and the use of antithrombotic. drugs. According to the guideline of the Japanese Society of Hypertension (JSH 2014), in the chronic phase of cerebral infarction, cerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage, target BP should be < 140/ 90 mmHg. In patients with lacunar infarction, those taking antithrombotic drugs, cerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage, a lower level, < 130/80 mmHg should be targeted if possible. Oral antihypertensive drugs such as Ca channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers and diuretics are recommended for patients with stroke.", 
    "1087": "Myocardial injury is the most common cause of death during the 30 days after noncardiac surgery. Only 14% of patients who are experiencing a perioperative myocardial infarction will have chest pain, and 65% are entirely clinically silent, which means that they will go undetected without routine troponin screening. Although it is tempting to dismiss asymptomatic troponin elevation, mortality is similar with and without symptoms. Furthermore, mortality at 30 days in patients who have postoperative troponin elevation is a concerning 10%, which represents a 5-fold increase from background risk. Among inpatients \u226545 years of age who are having noncardiac surgery, the number necessary to screen to detect myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery, that would otherwise be missed, is only about 15 patients. Thus, troponin screening seems appropriate for most surgical inpatients who are \u226545 years of age. Potential acute interventions include initiating therapy such as aspirin, statins, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor antihypertensives, along with chronic lifestyle improvements such as smoking cessation, healthful eating, and exercise.",

The most common AAE management strategies included diphenhydramine (63.5%, n=54), corticosteroids (50.6%, n=43) and ranitidine (31.8%, n=27). Epinephrine was administered in 21.2% (n=18) of AAE patients, five of whom received repeated doses. Four AAE patients required admission (4.7%) and one required endotracheal intubation. Epinephrine induced morbidity in two patients, causing myocardial ischemia or dysrhythmia shortly after administration.",

The panel of experts who produced this consensus document developed a research protocol based on a review of the literature. The prevalence of allergic reactions to iodinated contrast media (ICM) is estimated to be 1:170 000, that is, 0.05%-0.1% of patients undergoing radiologic studies with ICM (more than 75 million examinations per year worldwide). Hypersensitivity reactions can appear within the first hour after administration (immediate reactions) or from more than 1 hour to several days after administration (nonimmediate or delayed reactions). The risk factors for immediate reactions include poorly controlled bronchial asthma, concomitant medication (eg, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, \u00df-blockers, and proton-pump inhibitors), rapid administration of the ICM, mastocytosis, autoimmune diseases, and viral infections. The most common symptoms of immediate reactions are erythema and urticaria with or without angioedema, which appear in more than 70% of patients. Maculopapular rash is the most common skin feature of nonimmediate reactions (30%-90%). Skin and in vitro tests should be performed for diagnosis of both immediate and nonimmediate reactions. The ICM to be administered will therefore be chosen depending on the results of these tests, the ICM that induced the reaction (when known), the severity of the reaction, the availability of alternative ICM, and the information available on potential ICM cross-reactivity. Another type of contrast media, gadolinium derivatives, is used used for magnetic resonance imaging. Although rare, IgE-mediated reactions to gadolinium derivatives have been reported.",

Morbidity benefits of the drug were seen within 1\u00a0month of initiation. However, hypotension due to enalapril or the LCZ696 regimen during a run-in phase eliminated 20\u00a0% of patients. Safety concerns included the risk of angioedema and the theoretical concern of neurocognitive dysfunction due to the protean effects of neprilysin inhibition. The role of LCZ696 in patients with asymptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction is uncertain. LCZ696 is currently being evaluated in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, with promising initial results. LCZ696 represents a novel mechanistic approach to targeting heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, and ongoing studies will address its use in other cardiovascular populations.",

Stability was assessed by means of measuring percent recovery at varying time points throughout a 90-day period. The quantification of the active pharmaceutical ingredients was performed by a stability-indicating, high-performance liquid chromatographic method. The beyond-use date of the products was found to be at least 90 days for all suspensions (except atenolol 1 mg/mL, which was stable up to 60 days), both for controlled refrigerated temperature and room temperature. This confirms that SyrSpend SF PH4 is a stable suspending vehicle for compounding with a broad range of different active pharmaceutical ingredients.", 
    "1096": "Imbalance of salt and water is a frequent and challenging complication of kidney disease, whose pathogenic mechanisms remain elusive. Employing an albumin overload mouse model, we discovered that albuminuria enhanced the expression of NHE3 and NCC but not other transporters in murine kidney in line with the stimulation of angiotensinogen (AGT)/angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)/angiotensin (Ang) II cascade. In primary cultures of renal tubular cells, albumin directly stimulated AGT/ACE/Ang II and upregulated NHE3 and NCC expression. Blocking Ang II production with an ACE inhibitor normalized the upregulation of NHE3 and NCC in cells. Interestingly, albumin overload significantly reduced mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (SOD2), and administration of a SOD2 mimic (MnTBAP) normalized the expression of NHE3, NCC, and the components of AGT/ACE pathway affected by albuminuria, indicating a key role of mitochondria-derived oxidative stress in modulating renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and renal sodium transporters. In addition, the functional data showing the reduced urinary excretion of Na and Cl and enhanced response to specific NCC inhibitor further supported the regulatory results of sodium transporters following albumin overload. More importantly, the upregulation of NHE3 and NCC and activation of ACE/Ang II signaling pathway were also observed in albuminuric patient kidneys, suggesting that our animal model accurately replicates the human condition. Taken together, these novel findings demonstrated that albuminuria is of importance in resetting renal salt handling via mitochondrial oxidative stress-initiated stimulation of ACE/Ang II cascade. This may also offer novel, effective therapeutic targets for dealing with salt and water imbalance in proteinuric renal diseases.",

In patients not corresponding to either of the previous conditions, dynamic confirmatory testing is mandatory. Several tests are available, based on aldosterone suppression by saline loading, fludrocortisone administration or converting enzyme inhibition by captopril. One test is based on renin stimulation by furosemide administration. Each of these tests has its limitations, and validation is incomplete.

    "1109": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) degrades angiotensin (Ang) II to Ang-(1-7), and protects against diabetic renal injury. Soluble ACE2 fragments are shed from the proximal tubule, and appear at high levels in the urine with diabetes. High glucose-induced shedding of ACE2 from proximal tubular cells is mediated by the enzyme \"a disintegrin and metalloproteinase-17\u2033 (ADAM17). Here, we investigated the mechanism for constitutive shedding of ACE2. Mouse proximal tubular cells were cultured and ACE2 shedding into the media was assessed by enzyme activity assay and immunoblot analysis. Cells were incubated with pharmacologic inhibitors, or transfected with silencing (si) RNA. Incubation of proximal tubular cells with increasing concentrations of D-glucose stimulated ACE2 shedding, which peaked at 16 mM, while L-glucose (osmotic control) had no effect on shedding. In cells maintained in 7.8 mM D-glucose, ACE2 shedding was significantly inhibited by the pan-protein kinase C (PKC) competitive inhibitor sotrastaurin, but not by an inhibitor of ADAM17. Incubation of cells with the PKC-\u03b1 and -\u03b21-specific inhibitor Go6976, the PKC \u03b21 and \u03b22-specific inhibitor ruboxistaurin, inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases-2,-8, and -9, or an inhibitor of ADAM10 (GI250423X) had no effect on basal ACE2 shedding. By contrast, the PKC-\u03b4 inhibitor rottlerin significantly inhibited both constitutive and high glucose-induced ACE2 shedding. Transfection of cells with siRNA directed against PKC-\u03b4 reduced ACE2 shedding by 20%, while knockdown of PKC-\u03b5 was without effect. These results indicate that constitutive shedding of ACE2 from proximal tubular cells is mediated by PKC-\u03b4, which is also linked to high glucose-induced shedding. Targeting PKC-\u03b4 may preserve membrane-bound ACE2 in proximal tubule in disease states and diminish Ang II-stimulated adverse signaling.",

Many renal physicians think of Alport syndrome as primarily affecting men. However, twice as many women are affected by the X-linked diseases. Affected women are commonly undiagnosed, but 15%-30% develop renal failure by 60 years and often hearing loss by middle age. Half of their sons and daughters are also affected. Autosomal recessive Alport syndrome is less common, but is often mistaken for X-linked disease. Recessive inheritance is suspected where women develop early-onset renal failure or lenticonus. Their family may be consanguineous. The prognosis for other family members is very different from X-linked disease. Other generations, including parents and offspring, are not affected, and on average only one in four of their siblings inherit the disease. All women with Alport syndrome should have their diagnosis confirmed with genetic testing, even if their renal function is normal, because of their own risk of renal failure and the risk to their offspring. Their mutations indicate the mode of inheritance and the likelihood of disease transmission to their children, and the mutation type suggests the renal prognosis for both X-linked and recessive disease. Women with X-linked Alport syndrome should be tested at least annually for albuminuria and hypertension. The \"Expert guidelines for the diagnosis and management of Alport syndrome\" recommend treating those with albuminuria with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockade (and adequate birth control because of the teratogenic risks of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors), believing that this will delay renal failure. Current recommendations are that women with autosomal recessive Alport syndrome should be treated with RAAS blockade from the time of diagnosis. In addition, women should be offered genetic counseling, informed of their reproductive options, and monitored closely during pregnancy for the development of hypertension.",

    "1142": "The impact of heart failure (HF) on acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in patients from southwestern China remains unclear. The present study aimed to compare in-hospital cardiovascular events, mortality and clinical therapies in AMI patients with or without HF in southwestern China. In total, 591 patients with AMI hospitalized between February 2009 and December 2012 were examined; those with a history of HF were excluded. The patients were divided into four groups according to AMI type (ST-elevated or non-ST-elevated AMI) and the presence of HF during hospitalization. Clinical characteristics, in-hospital cardiovascular events, mortality, coronary angiography and treatment were compared. Clinical therapies, specifically evidence-based drug use were analyzed in patients with HF during hospitalization, including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and \u03b2-blockers (BBs). AMI patients with HF had a higher frequency of co-morbidities, lower left ventricular ejection fraction, longer length of hospital stay and a greater risk of in-hospital mortality compared with AMI patients without HF. AMI patients with HF were less likely to be examined by cardiac angiography or treated with reperfusion therapy or recommended medications. AMI patients with HF co-treated with ACEIs and BBs had a significantly higher survival rate (94.4 vs. 67.5%; P<0.001) compared with untreated patients or patients treated with either ACEIs or BBs alone. Logistic regression analysis revealed that HF and cardiogenic shock in patients with AMI were the strongest predictors of in-hospital mortality. AMI patients with HF were at a higher risk of adverse outcomes. Cardiac angiography and timely standard recommended medications were associated with improved clinical outcomes.",

The treatment effect for the primary outcome was estimated, stratified by dose level using time-updated Cox regression models. In the two treatment arms, participants with a dose reduction (43% of those randomized to enalapril and 42% of those randomized to sacubitril/valsartan) had similar baseline characteristics and similar baseline predictors of the need for dose reduction. In a time-updated analysis, any dose reduction was associated with a higher subsequent risk of the primary event [hazard ratio (HR) 2.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.2-2.7]. However, the treatment benefit of sacubitril/valsartan over enalapril following a dose reduction was similar (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.70-0.93, P < 0.001) to that observed in patients who had not experienced any dose reduction (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.71-0.88, P < 0.001).",

The below-10kDa fraction showed higher ACE-inhibitory activity and was subsequently purified by Sephadex G-15 gel filtration chromatography. The structure of active peptide was identified as Pro-Ala-Phe-Gly by HPLC-Q-TOF-MS and its IC50 value was 35.9\u03bcM. The yield of this peptide from E. clathrata protein was 0.82%. Lineweaver-Burk plots demonstrated that the inhibitory kinetic mechanism of this peptide was non-competitive.

Because of the low active pharmaceutical ingredient content, it was hypothesized that both powder and tablet properties could be determined only by the characteristics of excipients. In order to test this assumption, both experimental designs were done with placebo mixtures. The optimized formulation was then evaluated both with and without APIs. Results indicated that filler and lubricant percentage, along with compression force, were the most important variables during the formulation study. The optimized formulation showed similar characteristics in both cases for all responses, except for angle of repose and friability where only minor differences were observed. The combination of the applied approaches (using placebo composition and fractional experimental design) proved to be efficient, cost effective and time saving.",

Treating heart-failure patients has been a very challenging task. This review highlights the main pharmacological developments in the field of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, giving emphasis to a drug that has a dual-acting inhibition of the neprilysin and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Neprilysin is an enzyme that participates in the breakdown of biologically active natriuretic peptides and several other vasoactive compounds. The inhibition of neprilysin has been a therapeutic target for several drugs tested in cardiovascular disease, mainly for heart failure and/or hypertension. However, side effects and a lack of efficacy led to discontinuation of their development. LCZ696 is a first-in-class neprilysin- and angiotensin-receptor inhibitor that has been developed for use in heart failure. This drug is composed of two molecular moieties in a single crystalline complex: a neprilysin-inhibitor prodrug (sacubitril) and the angiotensin-receptor blocker (valsartan). The PARADIGM-HF trial demonstrated that this drug was superior to an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril) in reducing mortality in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. The ability to block the angiotensin receptor and augment the endogenous natriuretic peptide system provides a distinctive mechanism of action in cardiovascular disease.",

The A. elegans T3 proteases was observed to be more effective in generating small peptides with ACE-inhibitory activity. The 3 kDa membrane permeate of A. elegans T3 proteases hydrolysate showed the highest ACE-inhibitory activity with an IC50 of 0.79 mg/mL. After chromatographic separation by Sephadex G-15 gel filtration and reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography, the potent fraction was subjected to MALDI/TOF-TOF MS/MS for identification. A novel ACE-inhibitory peptide (VQY) was identified exhibiting an IC50 of 9.8 \u03bcM. The inhibitory kinetics investigation by Lineweaver-Burk plots demonstrated that the peptide acts as a competitive ACE inhibitor. The razor clam hydrolysate obtained by A. elegans T3 proteases could serve as a source of functional peptides with ACE-inhibitory activity for physiological benefits.",

With the aging population, increased risk factors for heart failure development, and better survival after myocardial infarction, the prevalence is only expected to increase in the coming years. Although existing therapies have improved the clinical course of heart failure patients, new approaches are urgently needed to enhance quality of life and reduce morbidity and mortality. However, there has been little progress in the treatment of chronic heart failure in the past decade with only two new drugs approved by the US FDA over this time. Better understanding of the neurohormonal axis of heart failure has lead to the development of LCZ696, a first-in-class novel agent that acts as an angiotensin receptor blocker and neprilysin inhibitor. In the PARADIGM-HF study, LCZ696 was superior to an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor in reducing mortality and HF hospitalizations and improving quality of life across a broad spectrum of symptomatic patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. While evaluation of long-term effects is still needed, the completed trials on LCZ696 demonstrate that the drug is generally well-tolerated with a safe side effect profile. LCZ696 should be strongly considered as a favorable alternative to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers in appropriate heart failure patients.", 
    "1164": "Following extensive clinical research, drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system have been used for the treatment of patients with congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, hypertension, diabetic nephropathy, chronic renal failure and for reducing the risk of developing major cardiovascular (CV) events. This review examines all mega trials (those involving >1000 patients) and smaller pivotal trials involving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is; 25 mega trials) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs; 27 mega trials) to provide perspective on the huge database of evidence that has accumulated on the use of these drugs. Our review demonstrates that ACE-Is and ARBs are generally as effective as conventional therapies in the treatment of hypertension, but offer additional cardioprotective benefits in patients with heart failure, and in those who have experienced myocardial infarction. Also, both ACE-Is and ARBs are capable of renal protection in addition to their blood-pressure-lowering effects. Although ACE-Is and ARBs provide major benefits to CV patients, doubts remain over the concept of blood-pressure-independent CV protection offered by both classes of drugs. ACE-Is and ARBs appear to be equally effective with respect to morbidity and mortality endpoints, but ARBs are better tolerated. Considering the available evidence, the combined use of an ACE-I and ARB should be avoided and full doses of either ACE-I or ARB should be aimed for as evidence suggests they provide a greater prognostic benefit.",

The widespread use of ACE inhibitors has been associated with several notable adverse effects such as hyperkalemia and an increased serum creatinine. There are no previous reports of alopecia associated with lisinopril use; however, a few previous cases of alopecia associated with other ACE inhibitors exist. This report discusses a case of lisinopril-induced alopecia of a 53-year-old male presenting to our outpatient heart failure clinic with a chief complaint of a new onset of alopecia. Upon evaluation, it was suspected that the patient's alopecia was likely medication induced by lisinopril; therefore, lisinopril was discontinued and switched to an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), losartan potassium. Alopecia resolved in 4 weeks after the therapeutic intervention. Our report suggests that the patient likely experienced a medication-induced alopecia, which was successfully resolved through proper identification and removal of the causative agent. Causality assessment between lisinopril and alopecia was determined using the Naranjo Adverse Drug Reaction Probability Scale-a total score of 6 was achieved and thus identified the adverse drug reaction as probable. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility that lisinopril may be an offending agent in a patient with unexplained alopecia.",

Results of the present study revealed MTX-induced hepatotoxicity as demonstrated by increased level of liver enzymes and confirmed by histopathology. Pretreatment with captopril or telmisartan produced a significant hepatic protection manifested as a significant (p\u2009<\u20090.05) decrease in serum levels of alanine transferase (ALT) and aspartate transferase (AST) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) enzymes; hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA) and total nitrites and nitrates (NOx) levels; as well as a significant increase in hepatic superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. In addition, there was a remarkable improvement in the histopathological features and a significant reduction in the expression of COX-2, iNOS and caspase-3 enzymes as compared with the MTX group.

Although the underlying mechanism is not fully understood, excess bradykinin produced through a complex interplay between the kallikrein-kinin and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone systems is thought to play a major role. The nonallergic nature of the reaction renders traditional therapies (corticosteroids and antihistamines) ineffective because those agents do not modify the proposed pathophysiology. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) provides kinase II, a protein that breaks down bradykinin. Case reports support FFP as a treatment for ACEI-induced angioedema, but no formal evaluations have been completed to date. Both ecallantide and complement 1 esterase (C1) inhibitor concentrate reduce bradykinin production through upstream inhibition of kallikrein. C1 inhibitor concentrate has been used successfully to manage ACEI-induced angioedema in a few reported cases, but robust supportive studies are lacking. Conversely, ecallantide has been evaluated in multiple randomized trials but has not been shown to offer advantages over traditional therapies. The use of icatibant, a direct antagonist of bradykinin B2 receptors, was reported to be beneficial in several case reports and in a small Phase II study, safely and rapidly reducing symptoms of ACEI-induced angioedema.

    "1184": "Historically, the first described effect of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor was an increased activity of bradykinin, one of the substrates of ACE. However, in the subsequent years, molecular models describing the mechanism of action of ACE inhibitors in decreasing blood pressure and cardiovascular risk have focused mostly on the renin-angiotensin system. Nonetheless, over the last 20\u00a0years, the importance of bradykinin in regulating vasodilation, natriuresis, oxidative stress, fibrinolysis, inflammation, and apoptosis has become clearer. The affinity of ACE appears to be higher for bradykinin than for angiotensin I, thereby suggesting that ACE inhibitors may be more effective inhibitors of bradykinin degradation than of angiotensin II production. Data describing the effect of ACE inhibition on bradykinin signaling support the hypothesis that the most cardioprotective benefits attributed to ACE inhibition may be due to increased bradykinin signaling rather than to decreased angiotensin II signaling, especially when high dosages of ACE inhibitors are considered. In particular, modulation of bradykinin in the endothelium appears to be a major target of ACE inhibition. These new mechanistic concepts may lead to further development of strategies enhancing the bradykinin signaling.",

The glycated hemoglobin control recovery rates were 22.2, 18.5, and 15.2\u00a0% in the groups. The groups' triglyceride control satisfaction rates were 44.4, 43.3, and 39.8\u00a0%. The satisfaction rates of total cholesterol control were 34.5, 26.8, and 25.7\u00a0%, respectively and the satisfaction rates of LDL-c control of the three groups were 30.6, 23.8, and 22.1\u00a0%. This indicated an unregulated use of hypoglycemic agents, antihypertensives, and lipid-lowering drugs and low recovery rates for metabolic indicators of the cases. Among the 923 cases, 397 had microalbuminuria or clinical proteinuria, and only 22 patients took angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) as antihypertensive drugs. The use of antihypertensive drugs is not standardized, and only a small portion of patients were treated with ACEI or ARB drugs. Therefore, the proteinuria in diabetic patients should be timely screened and evaluated, as well as renal and metabolic function comprehensively regulated and antihypertensives and lipid-lowering drugs rationally used.", 
    "1186": "Statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) have markedly changed the clinical progression of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). The goal of this paper is to review the rationale and evidence for combining these three drug classes in hypertensive patients with hypercholesterolemia or CAD. Data sources include a literature search for publications on the use of a statin combined with various antihypertensive drugs in patients with hypertension and hypercholesterolemia or stable CAD. Hypercholesterolemia and hypertension constitute major physiological risk factors of ischemic heart disease. Current guidelines recommend a global approach to risk management, using agents that address as many risk factors as possible. Dual combination therapies are an important component of guideline-recommended therapy in hypertension. Our review of the literature indicates that triple therapy with a statin, ACE inhibitor, and CCB is associated with a significant reduction in major cardiovascular events. For example, a post hoc analysis in 1056 patients with stable CAD participating in the EUROPA trial indicated that the addition of perindopril to a CCB and a lipid-lowering agent was associated with a 46\u00a0% reduction in the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and resuscitated cardiac arrest (p\u00a0=\u00a00.023). In addition, single pill formulations are known to result in better adherence to the treatment. Single-pill formulations that combine a statin, an ACE inhibitor, and a CCB appear to offer an effective approach to the management of global cardiovascular risk.",

GLS and BLS were determined in 272 subjects with normal ejection fraction and no known coronary disease, or significant valve disease. Systolic blood pressure (SP) and diastolic blood pressure (DP) obtained at the time of echocardiography were used to adjust GLS and BLS as follows: strain\u00d7SP (mmHg)/120 mmHg and strain\u00d7DP (mmHg)/80 mmHg. Patients were followed for cardiac events and mortality. The mean age was 53\u00b115 years and 53% had hypertension. There were 19 cardiac events and 70 deaths over a mean follow-up of 26\u00b114 months. Cox analysis showed that left ventricular mass index (P=0.001), BLS (P<0.001), and DP-adjusted BLS (P<0.001) were independent predictors of cardiac events. DP-adjusted BLS added incremental value (P<0.001) to the other two predictors and had an area under the curve of 0.838 for events.

However, many of these studies were prone to bias and confounding, and questions remain over the validity of these outcomes. This observational, before-and-after quality improvement audit aimed to assess the effect of withholding these medications on the morning of surgery. We recruited 323 participants, with 83 (26%) having their preoperative angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) withheld on the day of surgery.

We investigated whether amlodipine could improve angiogenic responses in a diabetic rat model of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) through improving bone marrow endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) mobilization, in the same way as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Methods. After induction of AMI by coronary artery ligation, diabetic rats were randomly assigned to receive perindopril (2\u2009mgkg(-1)\u2009day(-1)), amlodipine (2.5\u2009mgkg(-1)\u2009day(-1)), or vehicle by gavage (n = 20 per group). Circulating EPC counts before ligation and on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, and 28 after AMI were measured in each group. Microvessel density, cardiac function, and cardiac remodeling were assessed 4 weeks after treatment. The signaling pathway related to EPC mobilization was also measured. Results. Circulating EPC count in amlodipine- and perindopril-treated rats peaked at day 7, to an obvious higher level than the control group peak which was reached earlier (at day 5). Rats treated with amlodipine showed improved postischemia neovascularization and cardiac function, together with reduced cardiac remodeling, decreased interstitial fibrosis, and cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Amlodipine treatment also increased cardiac SDF-1/CXCR4 expression and gave rise to activation of VEGF/Akt/eNOS signaling in bone marrow. Conclusions. Amlodipine promotes neovascularization by improving EPC mobilization from bone marrow in diabetic rats after AMI, and activation of VEGF/Akt/eNOS signaling may in part contribute to this.",

    "1214": "Aortic stiffness is an independent risk factor for development of cardiovascular diseases. Activation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) including angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity leads to overproduction of angiotensin II (ANGII) from its precursor angiotensin I (ANGI). ANGII leads to overexpression and activation of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2), which is critically associated with pathophysiology of aortic stiffness. We previously reported that the whey peptide Isoleucine-Tryptophan (IW) acts as a potent ACE inhibitor. Herein, we critically elucidate the mechanism of action by which IW causes inhibition of expression and activity of MMP2 in aortic tissue. Effects of IW on expression and activity of MMP2 were assessed on endothelial and smooth muscle cells (ECs and SMCs) in vitro and ex vivo (isolated rat aorta). As controls we used the pharmaceutical ACE inhibitor - captopril and the ANGII type 1 receptor blocker - losartan. In vitro, both ANGII and ANGI stimulation significantly (P<0.01) increased expression of MMP2 assessed with western blot. Similarly, to captopril IW significantly (P<0.05) inhibited ANGI, but not ANGII mediated increase in expression of MMP2, while losartan also blocked effects of ANGII. Signaling pathways regulating MMP2 expression in ECs and SMCs were similarly inhibited after treatment with IW or captopril. In ECs IW significantly (P<0.05) inhibited JNK pathway, whereas in SMCs JAK2/STAT3 pathway, assessed with western blot. In vitro findings were fully consistent with results in isolated rat aorta ex vivo. Moreover, IW not only inhibited the MMP2 expression, but also its activation assessed with gelatin zymography. Our findings demonstrate that IW effectively inhibits expression and activation of MMP2 in rat aorta by decreasing local conversion of ANGI to ANGII. Thus, similar to pharmaceutical ACE inhibitor captopril the dipeptide IW may effectively inhibit ACE activity and prevent the age and hypertension associated rise of aortic stiffness.",

Whether such beneficial effects exerted by increased NO-levels include the vascular renin-angiotensin system remains elucidated. Exposure of endothelial cells originated from porcine aorta, mouse brain and human umbilical veins to different NO-donors showed that expression of the angiotensin-II-type-2-receptor (AT2) mRNA and protein is up-regulated by activation of soluble guanylyl cyclase, protein kinase G and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase without changing AT2 mRNA stability. In mice, endothelial-specific overexpression of eNOS stimulated, while chronic treatment with the NOS-blocker l-nitroarginine inhibited AT2 expression. The NO-induced AT2 up-regulation was associated with a profound inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-activity. In endothelial cells this reduction of ACE-activity was reversed by either the AT2 antagonist PD 123119 or by inhibition of transcription with actinomycin D. Furthermore, in C57Bl/6 mice an acute i.v. bolus of l-nitroarginine did not change AT2-expression and ACE-activity suggesting that inhibition of ACE-activity by endogenous NO is crucially dependent on AT2 protein level. Likewise, three weeks of either voluntary or forced exercise training increased AT2 expression and reduced ACE-activity in C57Bl/6 but not in mice lacking eNOS suggesting significance of this signaling interaction for vascular physiology. Finally, aortic AT2 expression is about 5 times greater in female as compared to male C57Bl/6 and at the same time aortic ACE activity is reduced in females by more than 50%.

Neither adrenaline inhalations, intravenously administrated corticosteroids, atropine nor furosemide were effective and the patient soon become bradycardic. A tracheotomy was performed and the patient was placed on a ventilator. She eventually made a full recovery. It was concluded that she had suffered from life-threatening angio-oedema due to her new medication.", 
    "1237": "Benazepril has been shown to inhibit circulating angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity in horses but the optimal dosage is unknown.", 
    "1238": "To determine the lowest tested dose of benazepril that results in \u226575% attenuation in the response of arterial blood pressure (BP) to exogenous angiotensin I (ANG-I) administration.", 
    "1239": "Prospective experimental study.", 
    "1240": "A total of 5 healthy horses were instrumented for the direct measurement of BP. Each horse received 4 intragastric doses of benazepril (0.5, 1, 2 and 4 mg/kg bwt) with a washout period of 7 days between doses. Prior to and 2, 12 and 24 h after benazepril administration, each horse received intravenous (i.v.) boluses of ANG-I at 20, 60 and 200 ng/kg. Attenuation of the systolic arterial pressure (SBP) response to ANG-I and serum ACE activity were quantified and expressed as percentage of inhibition.", 
    "1241": "There was a significant effect of benazepril dose (P = 0.004) and time (P = 0.004) on the percentage of inhibition of the systolic pressor response to ANG-I. Regardless of benazepril dose, the percentage of inhibition was significantly greater 2 h after administration of benazepril compared with 12 and 24 h. At an ANG-I dose of 20 ng/kg, the percentage of inhibition after administration of benazepril at 1 mg/kg bwt (46.6 \u00b1 18.9%) was significantly greater than that achieved after 0.5 mg/kg bwt (19 \u00b1 14%) but not significantly different from that achieved at higher doses of benazepril. Benazepril doses \u22651 mg/kg bwt resulted in serum ACE inhibition of at least 90%.", 
    "1242": "Small sample size and resulting low statistical power.", 
    "1243": "Attenuation of the rise in SBP in response to ANG-I after administration of benazepril is modest in horses despite adequate serum ACE inhibition. A dose of 1 mg/kg bwt would be recommended for future investigations of benazepril for the management of cardiovascular diseases in horses.", 
    "1244": "Prisoners can have difficulty obtaining subspecialty consultations. Telemedicine is used to provide diabetes consultations for residents of correctional facilities from our diabetes center. Telemedicine helps improve access to endocrinologists at reduced cost, but little outcome data are available.", 
    "1245": "A retrospective chart review of prisoners from 15 correctional facilities who received televisits for diabetes from 2011 to 2014 was performed. Demographic information, complications, medications, blood pressure, and laboratory results were collected.", 
    "1246": "At baseline (n\u2009=\u2009106), mean age was 44 years, duration of diabetes was 15 years, 44% had type 1 diabetes, and all were male. Only 64 of the participants had \u22652 video consultations; 58/64 had follow-up HbA1c results; and 53/58 were insulin requiring. Mean initial HbA1c was 9.3% with an average decrease of 0.5% from initial to final visit (a mean of 3.6 televisits). Patients with an initial HbA1c >9% (n\u2009=\u200928) had an average drop of 1.3%. Twenty-two subjects had initial elevated blood pressure; 20/22 (91%) were prescribed angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors (ACE-I)/angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB); and 15 of these 20 (75%) had a final blood pressure <140/90\u2009mm Hg over a mean of 3.3 televisits. 17/20 with high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) were treated with statin drugs; 15/17 (88%) had improved LDL on follow-up. Follow-up was limited by prisoner availability or visit cancellation by prison facility.", 
    "1247": "Improvements in glycemic, blood pressure, and lipid control for prisoners with diabetes can be achieved with teleconsultations to correctional institutions. Given the high costs of transporting prisoners to healthcare facilities, telemedicine should be considered to help improve diabetes care for this vulnerable population.", 
    "1248": "Lisinopril is a drug of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor class that is primarily used in the treatment of hypertension. During the scale-up of the lisinopril process, one unknown impurity was observed and is identified. The present work describes the origin, synthesis, characterization, and control of this impurity. This paper also describes the synthesis and characterization of three other impurities listed in the European Pharmacopoeia 8.4 (Impurity C, D, and F)."
