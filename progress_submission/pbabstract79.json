    "0": "The aim of this study was to test the efficacy of captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and a known suppressor of fibrosis, in preventing late radiation-induced cardiac pathology. Myocardial functional, histochemical and ultrastructural-morphometric studies were done on perfused hearts of rats isolated 3 and 6 months after 60Co gamma irradiation with 20 Gy and age-matched controls. At each time the animals were divided into the following groups: nonirradiated controls; irradiated once with 20 Gy; irradiated as above and given daily doses of captopril; daily doses of captopril without irradiation. The results showed that captopril, while ameliorating the decrease in the indices of capillary function, increase in mast cells, fibrosis, number of atrial granules, and changes in nerve terminals, failed to prevent the progressive functional deterioration of the hearts after irradiation. These findings suggest that an intramyofiber derangement may be involved in the long-term myocardial complications of irradiation.", 
    "1": "The concept of \"cardioprotection\" with ACE inhibitors has evolved over the last decade. In the 1980s, protective benefits of ACE inhibitors in hypertension were established, regression of left ventricular hypertrophy was demonstrated, and improved ventricular function and survival in mild-to-moderate and severe congestive heart failure was documented. A further \"protective\" role of ACE inhibitors in coronary artery disease is emerging as more attention is focused on the concept of local tissue renin-angiotensin systems. Recent contributions to the literature describe significant benefits of ACE-inhibitor therapy in acute myocardial infarction, including suppression of ventricular arrhythmias and reduction of both early and late ventricular dilation, preservation of left ventricular function, and improved survival. All of the above effects can be considered \"cardioprotective.\" However, as new benefits are reported in the 1990s, a broadened view of \"cardiovascular protection\" emerges from investigative studies in the literature. ACE inhibitors may reduce tolerance to nitrates, reduce angina in some but not all studies, and limit smooth muscle cell proliferation (and perhaps restenosis) induced by experimental balloon angioplasty. Local vascular effects may attenuate atherosclerotic changes in the arterial wall in experimental animals and may decrease the incidence of aneurysm formation in hypertensive animals. The effectiveness of ACE inhibitors in acute myocarditis, suggested by reports that captopril may reduce lesions of murine myocarditis when administered early after infection with coxsackievirus B3, requires clinical confirmation. Despite these apparently diverse \"cardiovascular protective\" consequences of ACE inhibitor therapy, the mechanism(s) of action of these agents remain to be elucidated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "2": "Thiol compounds have been investigated as inhibitors of the covalent binding reaction of human complement protein C4 using Sepharose-C1s as a combined activating and binding surface. o- and p-substituted aminothiophenols are equally effective inhibitors, whereas the m-substituted compound is a less potent inhibitor. The anti-hypertensive drug captopril is also shown to inhibit the covalent binding reaction. A comparison of the effects of these compounds on the covalent binding reaction of isolated C4A and C4B has been made. Results suggest that a Pro-to-Leu substitution in C4B is likely to account for the differences in inhibitory potency of C4B compared with C4A observed with the aromatic inhibitors.", 
    "3": "Captopril renal scintigraphy (CRS) is a nuclear medicine technique for evaluating each kidney independently for changes in glomerular filtration rate and perfusion induced by captopril-associated alterations in vascular tone. This study was undertaken to determine the role of CRS in predicting the response to renal revascularization.", 
    "4": "The study group consisted of all patients who underwent preintervention CRS and arteriography, followed by renal revascularization performed between December 1987 and February 1992. After cessation of administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors for 48 hours, a standard renogram was obtained, a 50 mg dose of captopril was given, and a second renogram was obtained. A captopril-induced change in the renogram was present when a normal pre-captopril renogram became abnormal after captopril administration. An abnormal baseline scan by definition cannot have a captopril-induced change. Blood pressure before revascularization was compared with blood pressure at 3 to 6 months after the procedure according to American Heart Association criteria for hypertension response.", 
    "5": "Fifty patients received renal revascularization by operation (28 patients) or balloon angioplasty (22 patients). Preoperative captopril-induced changes were present in 29 of the 50 patients. Among the 29 patients with captopril-induced changes, hypertension was cured or improved in 26. When captopril-induced changes were not present, only one of 21 patients improved (p < 0.00001).", 
    "6": "On the basis of these data, CRS appears to reliably predict hypertension response to revascularization in patients with renovascular disease.", 
    "7": "Left ventricular myocardial blood flow and metabolic parameters were studied in dogs with severe heart failure induced by rapid ventricular pacing. The impact of early administration of enalapril was also evaluated. Seventeen dogs were randomly assigned in a blinded fashion to receive enalapril at a dose of 10 mg orally per day or a matching placebo commencing 1 week after initiation of pacing. Six dogs underwent sham operations and served as a control for the myocardial blood flow and metabolic studies. In general, there was no significant difference in myocardial blood flow among the control dogs, the placebo-treated, and the enalapril-treated, paced dogs. However, tissue adenosine triphosphate was markedly reduced in both the enalapril-treated, paced dogs (2.43 +/- 0.55 mumol/gm wet weight, mean +/- SD) and the placebo-treated, paced dogs (2.79 +/- 0.39 mumol/gm) compared with the level in control dogs (4.77 +/- 0.88 mumol/gm, both p < 0.01). Tissue glycogen and lactate levels were similar in the three groups. The time to development of severe heart failure tended to be longer in the enalapril-treated dogs (33 +/- 12 days) than in the placebo-treated dogs (24 +/- 10 days, p = 0.07). In pacing-induced heart failure, therefore, an imbalance between energy supply and demand may contribute to the left ventricular dysfunction, myocardial ischemia does not play a major role, and early treatment with enalapril may prolong the time to development of severe heart failure.", 
    "8": "The bradykinin peptide system is a tissue-based system with potent cardiovascular and renal effects. To investigate the regulation of this system, we developed a highly sensitive amino terminal-directed radioimmunoassay that, with high performance liquid chromatography, enables the measurement of bradykinin-(1-7), bradykinin-(1-8), and bradykinin-(1-9). Together with a carboxy terminal-directed radioimmunoassay, we characterized bradykinin peptides in rat kidney and blood. The predominant bradykinin peptides in kidney were bradykinin-(1-9) (approximately 100 fmol/g wet weight of tissue) and bradykinin-(1-7) (approximately 70 fmol/g), with low levels of bradykinin-(1-8) (approximately 8 fmol/g) and bradykinin-(4-9) (approximately 12 fmol/g) detectable; bradykinin-(2-9) and bradykinin-(3-9) were below the limits of detection. In blood, the levels of bradykinin-(1-9) were very low (approximately 2 fmol/ml), and other bradykinin peptides were below the limits of detection. Ile,Ser-bradykinin and Met,Ile,Ser-bradykinin were below the limits of detection in both kidney and blood, indicating that T-kininogen makes no detectable contribution to renal or circulating bradykinin peptides. Administration of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril was associated with an approximate twofold increase in renal levels of bradykinin-(1-8) and bradykinin-(1-9) and a decrease in the bradykinin-(1-7)/bradykinin-(1-9) ratio. The amino terminal-directed radioimmunoassay was also applied to heart, aorta, brown adipose tissue, adrenal lung, and brain. For these tissues, bradykinin-(1-7) and bradykinin-(1-9) were of similar abundance (16-340 fmol/g), with lower levels of bradykinin-(1-8). These studies demonstrate that tissue levels of bradykinin peptides are much higher than circulating levels, consistent with their formation at a local tissue site. Of peptides derived from K-kininogen, bradykinin-(1-9) is the predominant bioactive peptide in all tissues, and a major pathway of bradykinin-(1-9) metabolism involves the formation of bradykinin-(1-7). In kidney, angiotensin converting enzyme plays an important role in bradykinin-(1-9) metabolism, and increased bradykinin-(1-9) and bradykinin-(1-8) levels may mediate in part the renal effects of converting enzyme inhibition.", 
    "9": "Nonobese patients with essential hypertension have been reported to be insulin resistant. Because blockade of the renin-angiotensin system has been demonstrated to improve insulin sensitivity in hypertensive patients, the authors evaluated the effects of angiotensin-II administration and of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition with enalapril on insulin-mediated glucose uptake in normotensive men. The results showed no change in insulin sensitivity with either 0.3 ng/kg/min or 1 ng/kg/min angiotensin-II administration or with enalapril therapy. The authors conclude that neither physiologic amounts of angiotensin-II nor converting enzyme inhibition alter insulin sensitivity in normotensive men.", 
    "10": "The purpose of this investigation was to study whether favorable renal effects might contribute to the influence of captopril in offsetting ventricular dilatation after infarction. Effective renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate were estimated by isotope injection methods in 20 patients on days 2, 7, 8, 42 and 180 after a first transmural anterior myocardial infarction. After measurements on day 7, patients were randomized to receive either captopril 25 mg 3 times daily (n = 10) or placebo (n = 10) for the remainder of the study. At baseline (day 7) there were no differences between the 2 treatment groups in radionuclide left ventricular ejection fraction, effective renal plasma flow, glomerular filtration rate or neurohormones. Left ventricular ejection fractions (40 +/- 4% [mean +/- 2 SD] at baseline) were higher in the captopril- than the placebo-treated patients on days 42 (p < 0.05) and 180 (p < 0.01) after infarction. Effective renal plasma flow became significantly higher at all time points after randomization in the captopril-treated group than in the placebo group (p < 0.001). A similar but lesser trend was observed for glomerular filtration rate. Plasma atrial natriuretic factor and aldosterone were significantly higher in the placebo group (p < 0.05). Renal hemodynamic indexes were directly correlated with and neurohumoral indexes inversely correlated with ejection fractions. In a second group of 12 patients with higher baseline ejection fractions (48 +/- 4%) after an inferior infarction, none of these beneficial effects of captopril were demonstrable. It is proposed that in the setting of left ventricular dysfunction after infarction, a prompt and sustained improvement in renal hemodynamics, by reducing inappropriate fluid retention and thus ventricular preload, may be one contributory mechanism by which captopril prevents progression of left ventricular dilatation.", 
    "11": "The response of the human detrusor muscle to angiotensins was investigated and compared between neurogenic and control bladders. Both angiotensin I and II induced potent contraction of the human detrusor muscle. Saralasin completely inhibited the response to both angiotensins, while verapamil and indomethacin barely suppressed the contractility provoked by angiotensin II. Captopril completely blocked the response to angiotensin I. The contractile response of angiotensin II was abolished in Ca(++)-free Krebs' solution. The contractile strength of the neurogenic bladders induced by both angiotensin I and II was significantly weaker than that of the controls. However, there was no difference in ED50 value between the 2 groups. These results support the hypothesis that angiotensin I is converted to angiotensin II by angiotensin converting enzyme in the detrusor, and that angiotensin II subsequently contracts the detrusor muscle through angiotensin II receptors. The bladder contractility induced by the angiotensins was significantly less potent in the neurogenic bladders than in the control.", 
    "12": "In cirrhotic patients with ascites, captopril has deleterious effects on renal function, which have been referred to as captopril-induced arterial hypotension. The effects of this drug on renal function in cirrhosis were evaluated using low-dose captopril, thereby avoiding any change in arterial pressure.", 
    "13": "In a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, cross-over trial, the effects of 12.5 mg captopril on renal plasma flow, glomerular filtration rate (measured by radioisotopic techniques), and sodium excretion in healthy controls and cirrhotic patients with and without ascites were determined.", 
    "14": "In healthy subjects, captopril only induced a significant, 18% increase in renal plasma flow. In contrast, glomerular filtration rate significantly decreased in patients with (from 108 +/- 7 to 78 +/- 9 mL/min) and without ascites (from 102 +/- 4 to 88 +/- 3 mL/min), whereas renal plasma flow did not change. Urinary sodium excretion also significantly decreased in ascitic patients (from 43.8 +/- 4.4 to 30.6 +/- 3.8 mumol/min).",

    "17": "We studied prospectively 45 pregnant or recently postpartum women admitted to an obstetric intensive care unit with pulmonary edema during a 6-year period. Between 1 and 4 days after the onset of pulmonary edema, two-dimensional and M-mode echocardiography was performed, as was continuous, pulsed, and color Doppler echocardiography. The clinical diagnosis obtained from history, physical examination, chest radiograph, and laboratory data was compared with the echocardiographic diagnosis.", 
    "18": "Three therapeutically and prognostically distinct groups were identified by echocardiography: 1) those with decreased systolic function (N = 19), 2) those with normal systolic function but increased left ventricular mass and presumed diastolic dysfunction (N = 17), and 3) those with normal hearts (N = 9). During the study period, two patients with systolic dysfunction died and one underwent cardiac transplantation. Patients with systolic dysfunction required short- and long-term treatment with digoxin, diuretics, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Those with diastolic dysfunction received diuretics and long-term antihypertensive therapy. Women with normal hearts required acute therapy only. In 21 patients (47%), echocardiography demonstrated clinically unsuspected findings, which altered the long-term management in 16.", 
    "19": "Because clinical and roentgenographic findings do not accurately differentiate patients with respect to the presence and type of cardiac dysfunction, and because these subgroups differ with respect to treatment and probably prognosis, we recommend echocardiography to evaluate all pregnant women with pulmonary edema.", 
    "20": "It has been reported that some angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors can prevent stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats from stroke at much higher doses than clinical doses used for hypertension therapy. This study was performed to investigate the prophylactic effectiveness of imidapril against stroke in comparison with enalapril.", 
    "21": "Salt-loaded stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats were orally given imidapril (0.5, 1, 2, and 5 mg/kg per day), enalapril (2 and 5 mg/kg per day), or hydralazine (5 mg/kg per day). Stroke signs were scored, and blood pressure, protein concentration, and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase activity in urine were measured. After 2 weeks of medication, angiotensin converting enzyme activities in the aorta were measured 24 hours after dosing.", 
    "22": "In the control group, severe hypertension developed, and all rats died within 12 weeks because of stroke. Imidapril and enalapril dose-dependently decreased the stroke-related mortality, and both agents at 5 mg/kg per day showed excellent prophylaxis, although they did not inhibit hypertensive development. Imidapril at 0.5 mg/kg per day significantly prevented stroke to almost the same extent as enalapril at 2 mg/kg per day or hydralazine at 5 mg/kg per day. Imidapril dose-dependently suppressed the elevation of the two urinary indexes, which was followed by stroke. Imidapril inhibited enzyme activity in the aorta more strongly than did enalapril at the same dose.", 
    "23": "Imidapril prevented the incidence of stroke in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg per day or more by amelioration of kidney dysfunction. Reduction of blood pressure is not necessary, although enzyme inhibition in the vasculature may partly relate to the effect.", 
    "24": "The renin-angiotensin system plays multiple roles in the maintenance of normal blood pressure and renal function. The balance and integration of these roles change during development in ways that we do not yet fully understand.

    "25": "Antihypertensive drug therapy is used in children primarily to treat secondary forms of hypertension, because the prevalence of essential hypertension in the first decade of life is considerably less than 1% of the childhood population. This prevalence increases during the second decade of life, but the percentage of teenagers with essential hypertension continues to be low. Pharmaceutical companies have been able to target drug development to specific physiologic and biochemical systems. The converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium-channel blockers have greatly improved the success of therapy concomitant with a reduction in the incidence of adverse effects. The result has been a major change during the past decade in the recommendations for antihypertensive drug therapy.", 
    "26": "In an attempt to elucidate the physiological activities of (6E,12E)-tetradecadiene-8,10-diyne-1,3-diol diacetate (TDEYA), which was detected as a hydrolysis form (TDEY) in the plasma after oral administration of a decoction of Atractylodes rhizome in rats, we examined the inhibitory effects of various enzymes which are considered to participate in the regulation of body fluid levels and inflammatory reactions. TDEY and TDEYA did not show inhibitory effects on carbonic anhydrase (CA) or angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) at concentrations less than 1.0 x 10(-3) M. However, both acetylene compounds inhibited Na+,K+ adenosine triphosphatase (Na+,K(+)-ATPase) weakly and xanthine oxidase (XO) strongly. From the results of several acetylene compounds examined on XO inhibition, it is clear that the active structure of the compounds is due to the presence of conjugated triple and double bonds. In the in vivo experiment of TDEYA, urine volume, urinary electrolytes and uric acid excretion showed no significant differences from the control. However, the administration of TDEYA to rats tended to increase xanthine excretion.", 
    "27": "The protective effects of captopril were evaluated in vitro on isolated perfused rat hearts after a global ischemia of 20 min. The hearts were randomly allocated in 2 groups. In the first one (n = 6) captopril was added at a concentration of 270 microM. The second one was utilized as control (n = 6). Aortic flow and minute work respectively decreased on reperfusion by 35% and 49% in captopril group and by 65% and 71% in controls (p < 0.001). No changes occurred in heart rate. Aortic systolic pressure and coronary flow decreased in the 2 groups, but not significantly. Myocardial enzyme release during reperfusion showed significant lower levels of CPK and LDH in the captopril group as compared to controls (p < 0.001 after 41 min). The occurrence of serious ventricular arrhythmias was considerably higher in controls with respect to the captopril group. Irreversible ventricular fibrillation occurred only in control hearts (50%). These data indicate that captopril exerts a protective effect during myocardial ischemia and reperfusion by preventing serious ventricular arrhythmias, reducing enzymatic release and a lower decrease in cardiac performance, without an increase in heart rate.", 
    "28": "Angiotensin II has a plethora of different actions in the heart including, for instance, also slight positive inotropic effects. Thus cardiotonic therapy with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors should possibly be complemented by positive inotropic drug therapy. With this respect, novel cardiotonic drugs that increase calcium sensitivity of myofilaments such as pimobendan (CAS 118428-36-7) might be particularly useful, as they will increase force with little, if any concomitant increase in myoplasmic free calcium. These drugs mimic mechanistically the Frank-Starling-Mechanism or alpha-adrenergic effects which also involve, at least partly, calcium sensitization of the myofilaments. The latter may therefore be a useful therapeutic principle, in particular in cases where myofibrillar calcium responsiveness is pathologically depressed such as for instance in the stunned myocardium or under hypoxic conditions.",

Threshold concentrations of bradykinin (10(-10) M), kallidin (10(-9.5) M), and the slowly degraded bradykinin agonists D-Arg(Hyp3)-bradykinin (10(-9.5) M) and [Hyp3-Tyr(Me)8]-bradykinin (10(-10.5) M) caused partial relaxation of bovine rings with endothelium. Subsequent addition of ACE inhibitors markedly potentiated the relaxations to the kinins. Bradykinin concentrations in the organ bath measured by a specific bradykinin radioimmunoassay remained stable during the addition of lisinopril. Variation of the exposure time to bradykinin (10 to 60 min) did not affect the relaxations to the ACE inhibitor. The relaxations to lisinopril were not observed after either removal of the endothelium or incubation with nitro-l-arginine or the bradykinin-2 receptor antagonist Hoe 140. Other vasodilators including acetylcholine, adenosine diphosphate, substance P, or SIN-1 did not prime the rings to respond to ACE inhibitors. Endothelium dependent relaxation to lisinopril and captopril was also observed in human coronary arteries treated with bradykinin (> or = 10(-7) M), but not in those treated with substance P (10(-8) M).",

Lymphocyte beta-adrenoceptor function (intracellular cAMP production in response to isoprenaline) was studied as a surrogate tissue for myocardium, and increased significantly after quinapril at concentrations of isoprenaline between 10(-3) and 50 mmol.l-1. Lymphocyte beta-adrenoceptor density (six patients) measured by [125I] iodocyanopindolol binding, increased from 242 +/- 72 (mean +/- SEM) to 884 +/- 17 receptors/cell (P < 0.05). Changes in functional myocardial beta-adrenoceptor status were determined by measuring changes in haemodynamic responses to exercise and to incremental dobutamine infusion. Following quinapril there were significant improvements in cardiac index, stroke volume and cardiac power output during sub-maximal exercise testing and dobutamine infusion; stroke work index in response to dobutamine (but not exercise) improved significantly. ACE inhibitors cause lymphocyte beta-adrenoceptor upregulation in heart failure, which is associated with an improved cardiac pumping capacity in response to beta-agonist stimulation.",

In order to establish whether ANG II has any role in the regulation of water intake of rabbits, a comprehensive study of the effect of converting enzyme inhibition was undertaken. Enalaprilat was given systemically in various doses to sodium- and water-replete, sodium-deplete, and water-deprived rabbits, and the intake and excretion of water and sodium was measured. In replete rabbits systemic injection of enalaprilat, 8 mg/kg and 8 micrograms/kg, but not 0.8 mg/kg, was followed by increased daily water intake. In sodium-deplete rabbits injection of enalaprilat, 80 mg/kg, was followed by water drinking within 1 h, and daily sodium intake was reduced. Systemic administration of ANG II increased, but did not restore to control level the sodium appetite of sodium-deplete rabbits attenuated by 80 mg/kg enalaprilat. Rabbits deprived of water for 24 h, however, drank the same amount of water after injection of vehicle or enalaprilat, 80 and 8 mg/kg. The efficacy of converting enzyme inhibition was also tested by measuring the blood pressure response to ANG I. Blood pressure responses revealed that in replete animals converting enzyme activity was depressed below control levels for 30 h after injection of 80 mg/kg enalaprilat. In sodium-deplete rabbits blood pressure fell following injection of 80 mg/kg enalaprilat and did not return to control level until 48 h after the injection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Glomerular filtration rate (TcDTPA clearance) and effective renal plasma flow (hippuran clearance) as well as 24-hour urinary excretion of electrolytes and albumin were estimated at about 1 and 2.5 years of follow-up. Before initiation of antihypertensive therapy, the two groups were similar with regards to mean arterial pressure (119 +/- 2 vs. 120 +/- 4 mm Hg), effective renal plasma flow (285 +/- 26 vs. 248 +/- 33 ml/min/1.73 m2) and glomerular filtration rate (59 +/- 4 vs. 61 +/- 8 ml/min/1.73 m2 in the ACEI and CA groups, respectively). Both ACEI and CA treatments were associated with no change in renal function, a similar change in mean arterial pressure (ACEI -18 +/- 3; CA -13 +/- 5 mm Hg) and identical trough blood levels of cyclosporine. Urinary albumin excretion did not change significantly in any groups. Of interest, only in the ACEI group did filtration fraction significantly decrease (from 0.22 +/- 0.01% to 0.19 +/- 0.01% at final studies). These results indicate that in cyclosporine-treated transplant recipients, a satisfactory control of hypertension is obtained by chronic ACEI, which is as effective on arterial pressure as a combination of CA and atenolol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

In the present study, we investigated whether vasodilator prostanoids or platelet activating factor (PAF), both known to be produced in the renal medulla, were responsible for the hypotensive response to increased renal perfusion pressure. Anesthetized animals were treated with indomethacin (5 mg/kg + 0.5 mg/kg per hour), the PAF antagonist WEB 2086 (0.5 mg/kg + 0.5 mg/kg per hour), enalaprilat (2 mg/kg + 10 micrograms/kg per hour), or all three agents. In response to acute elevation of renal artery pressure to 170 mm Hg, systemic mean arterial pressure fell at 0.76 +/- 0.17, 0.59 +/- 0.08, and 0.76 +/- 0.17 mm Hg/min in the indomethacin, WEB 2086, and enalapril groups, respectively. These responses were not significantly different from the rate of 1.00 +/- 0.21 mm Hg/min in a control group that received vehicle infusion alone. Renal blood flow and the diuretic and natriuretic responses were also similar in all groups. Thus, increased renal perfusion pressure resulted in a progressive fall in systemic arterial pressure that was not mediated by PAF, prostaglandins, or suppression of renin release and angiotensin II production.",

Ang II was infused intravenously in male Sprague-Dawley rats for 3 days at 100 (low dose), 300 (medium dose), or 1,000 (high dose) ng/kg per minute (n = 8 for each group).

A better understanding of its physiopathology and the detrimental effect of neurohormonal activation that it induces were the reasons for the utilisation of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors leading to symptomatic improvement and also a reduction in the mortality of severe cardiac failure, as demonstrated in the CONSENSUS study published 5 years ago. Since then, cardiologists have presented ACE inhibitors in all stages of cardiac failure, but is this attitude justified? More explicitly, are ACE inhibitors the drugs of choice in cardiac failure? Before acknowledging this label \"drug of choice\" in the treatment of chronic cardiac failure, ACE inhibitors should fulfill certain reference criteria proposed by Packer for the treatment of this condition: rapid relief of symptoms; reduced mortality; modification of the natural history of the condition; efficacious and well tolerated. The effects of ACE inhibitors are analysed critically taking into account the results of large scale therapeutic trials (SOLVD, V-HeFT II, CONSENSUS II, SAVE), which have been reported recently?

In patients with acute myocardial infarction and heart failure the neuroendocrine activation was more intensively expressed. This study presents clinical consequences of neuroendocrine activation. Its relation to ventricular remodeling, as a potentially maladaptive mechanism is especially discussed. Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors influence favourably both neuro-endocrine activation and ventricular remodeling after myocardial infarction.

Treatments were given for up to 12 weeks. Beta-blocker and thiazide were continued unchanged. All three active drugs reduced supine BP relative to placebo; mean BP changes attributable to active treatment (95% confidence intervals): captopril 13.4/10.3 mmHg (0.6/4.0 to 26.2/16.6), hydralazine 15.0/10.0 mmHg (1.7/3.4 to 28.3/16.6), nifedipine 16.8/8.1 mmHg (4.0/1.8 to 29.6/14.4). There were no significant differences between the agents. Results for erect BP were similar. Target BP (< 140/95 mmHg) was achieved more frequently on captopril (33%), hydralazine (29%) and nifedipine (17%) than on placebo (10%). Compared with the other treatments captopril increased serum potassium concentration (P = 0.01), and hydralazine reduced serum cholesterol concentration (median changes: captopril -0.2 mmol/l, hydralazine -0.8 mmol/l, nifedipine -0.2 mmol/l, and placebo +0.2 mmol/l, P < 0.001). Overall, side-effects did not differ significantly between the groups; withdrawals resulting from adverse reactions: captopril 15%, hydralazine 24%, nifedipine 22%, and placebo 3% (chi 2 = 8.2, P = 0.04). Captopril, hydralazine and nifedipine did not differ significantly in efficacy and tolerability when added to atenolol and bendrofluazide. However, there were trends in favour of captopril, on which drug the highest proportion of patients had their BP controlled and the lowest proportion were withdrawn because of side-effects. Thus, of the drugs tested, captopril appears to be the best option as third drug in hypertension.",

He had been treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) for 7 years and showed marked hypokalemia with increased urinary potassium excretion. Hormonal examination revealed a normal plasma aldosterone concentration and increased plasma renin activity (PRA, 13.4 ng/ml/h), so potassium losing nephropathy was suspected. After discontinuation of the ACEI, PRA decreased to normal. An adrenal adenoma was found on abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and adrenalectomy was performed to confirm aldosterone producing adenoma (APA). Although ACEIs are said not to alter PRA in APA, this drug was primarily responsible for the increased PRA in this case. This is a rare case of APA, which showed markedly increased PRA during ACEI treatment.", 
    "68": "We had a 20-year-old male patient of secondary aldosteronism similar to Bartter's syndrome, which had proved to be evident after the remission of nephrotic syndrome. In the patient, hypokalemic alkalosis and hyperreninemic hyperaldosteronemia were observed, although the blood pressure was normal. Hyperplasia of juxtaglomerular cells was observed and no abnormalities indicating either glomerulonephritis or renal artery stenosis were found; the pressor response to intravenously infused angiotensin (ang) II was markedly decreased; urinary prostaglandin (PG) E2, kallikrein and kinin excretion were elevated. The inhibition of PG synthesis with indomethacin decreased renal PG production and partially corrected both hypokalemia and pressor responsiveness to ang II. Thus, this case is considered to be a case of Bartter's syndrome. Contrary to the previously reported observations, the effective fractional chloride reabsorption rate in the renal distal tubules was normal (> 80%) and not changed by PG inhibition. Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide level was normal. An interaction between renin-angiotensin and PG systems appears to play a prior role in this case. To explain the pathophysiology, we have hypothesized an abnormal function of ang II receptor signal transduction which excessively stimulates PLA2, resulting in overproduction of PG synthesis in tissues.", 
    "69": "Some studies have suggested that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition in patients with heart failure is associated with a decrease in frequency of spontaneous premature ventricular complexes (PVCs). It is not clear whether such a finding represents a primary effect of ACE inhibition or, instead, a secondary result of treatment of heart failure. For a primary drug effect to be present, PVC suppression during ACE inhibition should also occur in patients with preserved left ventricular systolic function. We therefore undertook a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover clinical trial to assess the effect of oral captopril (50 mg. b.i.d.) on ventricular arrhythmia frequency in 11 patients with > 30 PVCs/h (during a 48-h ambulatory recording) and a left ventricular ejection fraction of > or = 45% (measured by radionuclide multigated acquisition scan). Pharmacologic activity of the administered drug was evidenced by an increase in median plasma renin activity to 2.4 ng/AI/ml/h from a value of 1.1 ng/AI/ml/h during placebo (p = 0.001) and an 8.5 +/- 10.3 drop in mean diastolic blood pressure during captopril versus placebo (p < 0.03). During captopril treatment, a mean of 491 +/- 378 PVCs/h were observed compared with 389 +/- 169 PVCs/h during placebo, a nonsignificant difference. There was also no significant change in left ventricular ejection fraction, plasma catecholamines, or serum potassium during captopril treatment. Thus, ACE inhibition in patients with preserved left ventricular systolic function fails to suppress ventricular ectopic activity. Extrapolated to patients with heart failure, our observations argue against a primary PVC suppressive action of ACE inhibitors but do not rule out possible secondary antiarrhythmic effects of these agents.",

Exercise stimulates release of renin; this action was greater with captopril administration (treatment effect: p < 10(-4), indicating blockade of the RAS. This inhibition was incomplete because AII levels increased markedly when captopril was given (no treatment effect: p < 0.37).

    "78": "Left ventricular hypertrophy is a frequent and early manifestation of cardiac structural adaptation in patients with essential hypertension. Prospective studies have clearly demonstrated that left ventricular hypertrophy represents a risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, including sudden cardiac death. The increased risk is independent of the impact of high blood pressure and other risk factors on the cardiovascular system. Various clinical studies noted increased prevalence and severity of premature ventricular beats in hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy. Hypertrophy of myocardial cells, dilation of the left ventricle, increased stress of subendocardial myocardium and impaired coronary reserve are discussed as a possible pathogenetic link between myocardial hypertrophy and ventricular arrhythmias. Therapeutically, the primary goal for ventricular arrhythmias in hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy is regression of left ventricular mass. For this purpose, centrally sympatholytic agents, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, betablockers and calcium antagonists have been found to be effective. Recently we observed that a reduction of left ventricular hypertrophy was associated with a decreased prevalence and severity of ventricular arrhythmias.

    "86": "Secondary aldosteronism has deleterious effects in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) and can contribute to congestion, ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden death. Mortality is higher in patients with elevated levels of plasma aldosterone. Aldosterone increases as CHF progresses as a result of activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). This is further amplified by the routine use of diuretics. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors produce a profound and consistent inhibition of angiotensin II production, but they exert only a mild and transient antialdosterone effect. In a number of studies involving ACE inhibitors, plasma aldosterone levels at the end of the trial do not differ significantly from baseline. Spironolactone, a specific aldosterone receptor antagonist, may exert an independent and additive effect to that of ACE inhibitors. Apart from its renal effects, recent evidence suggests that spironolactone may exert direct cardiac and vascular effects inhibiting cardiac collagen hypertrophy and limiting vascular constriction. Combining an ACE inhibitor and spironolactone may achieve a more complete inhibition of the whole RAAS and may produce further clinical benefits. The efficacy and safety of such a combination has not been properly addressed. In the CONSENSUS trial, plasma potassium and creatinine levels were not necessarily adversely affected when enalapril was added to the regimens of patients receiving spironolactone, a condition existing in > 40% of the patients enrolled in this study. One prospective open study and other anecdotal reports suggest that combining spironolactone and ACE inhibitors resulted in clinical improvement without serious side effects in patients who could not tolerate further increases in the ACE inhibitor dose.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

It is clear, however, that an activation of several neurohormonal systems and the interplay between kidneys, adrenal glands, and heart contribute to abnormal sodium and water homeostasis. Aldosterone, the body's most potent mineralocorticoid hormone, contributes to intravascular and extravascular volume expansion, and thus to the appearance of symptomatic failure. Antialdosterone therapy in patients with secondary hyperaldosteronism due to heart failure must achieve one or more of the following goals: reduce or, preferably, normalize plasma aldosterone levels by limiting synthesis; antagonize the renal and systemic effects of aldosterone at its receptor sites; and eliminate or minimize the multiple stimuli to aldosterone secretion.",

Captopril was added to each patient's regimen, which comprised combinations of furosemide (124 patients), digitalis (117 patients), and spironolactone (90 patients). By the end of the first month of captopril administration, improvement in NYHA functional class was seen in 89 patients (72%). During the first year of captopril treatment, the number of hospital admissions and hospital days declined significantly (p < 0.001) and functional class improved significantly (p < 0.001). Although most patients tolerated captopril well, 44% experienced hypotension, which in 10% of patients necessitated termination of captopril therapy. Although mean serum potassium levels tended to increase, serious hyperkalemia did not occur. After 1 year, a subset of 30 patients who had not initially received spironolactone deteriorated clinically and manifested increasing urinary aldosterone levels. Hypotension precluded increasing the captopril dose, but introduction of spironolactone improved clinical status in this cohort.

The use of high-dose loop diuretics is currently advised to overcome diuretic resistance in refractory congestive heart failure (CHF). In a baseline controlled study, we evaluated 21 patients with diuretic resistance and evident fluid retention for the responses to 5 days of double drug therapy consisting of high-dose loop diuretic (10 mg oral bumetanide) in combination with the maximum tolerable dose of an ACE inhibitor (individualized to blood pressure and kidney function). Five patients (24%) showed a gross natriuresis and reduction in excess weight > 25% in response to this therapy. The remaining 16 patients (76%) with insufficient responses (i.e., < 25% reduction in excess weight) subsequently received 100 mg spironolactone once a day for 7 days in addition to the double therapy. Spironolactone coadministration was highly effective in 13 of 16 patients (81%). Marked natriuresis and diuresis were achieved within the next week of treatment, and CHF symptoms regressed or disappeared. The clinical course was similar in the bumetanide-ACE inhibitor and the bumetanide-ACE inhibitor-spironolactone treatment (triple therapy) groups. Plasma aldosterone was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in the patients who needed spironolactone. The 3 patients who were considered refractory to triple therapy exhibited the highest baseline plasma aldosterone concentrations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Treatment with 10(-5) M captopril enhanced the bradykinin-induced relaxation and shifted the concentration-response curve to the left (EC50 = 7.6 x 10(-10) M).

On SDS gels of the proteins pooled after the last purification step, the enzyme appeared homogeneous and behaved as a 70-kDa monomer. The peptidase was not sensitive to specific inhibitors of aminopeptidases, pyroglutamyl aminopeptidase I, endopeptidase 24.11, endopeptidase 24.15, proline endopeptidase and angiotensin-converting enzyme but was potently inhibited by several metal chelators such as o-phenanthroline and EDTA and was blocked by divalent cations. The specificity of endopeptidase 24.16 towards peptides of the tachykinin, opioid and neurotensin families was examined by competition experiments of tritiated neurotensin hydrolysis as well as HPLC analysis. These results indicated that endopeptidase 24.16 could discriminate between peptides belonging to the same family. Neurotensin, Lys8-Asn9-neurotensin(8-13) and xenopsin were efficiently hydrolysed while neuromedin N and kinetensin underwent little if any proteolysis by the peptidase. Analogously, substance P and dynorphins (1-7) and (1-8) were readily proteolysed by endopeptidase 24.16 while neurokinin A, amphibian tachykinins and leucine or methionine enkephalins totally resisted degradation. By Triton X-114 phase separation, 15-20% of endopeptidase 24.16 partitioned in the detergent phase, indicating that renal endopeptidase 24.16 might exist in a genuine membrane-bound form. The equipotent solubilization of the enzyme by seven detergents of various critical miscellar concentrations confirmed the occurrence of a membrane-bound counterpart of endopeptidase 24.16. Furthermore, the absence of release elicited by phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C suggested that the enzyme was not attached by a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol anchor in the membrane of renal microvilli.

    "108": "With the aim of characterizing the active site of the neutral endopeptidase [EC 3.4.24.11 (NEP)] and especially its putative S1 subsite, two series of new thiol inhibitors designed to interact with the S1, S'1, and S'2 subsites of the enzyme have been synthesized. These molecules correspond to the general formula HSCH(R1)CH(R2)CONHCH(R3)COOH (series I) and HSCH(R1)CH(R2)CONHCH(R3)CONHCH(R4)COOH (series II). Due to the synthetic pathway used, these inhibitors were obtained as mixtures of four stereoisomers. HPLC separation of the stereoisomers of 17 HSCH[CH2CH(CH3)2]CH(CH2Ph)CONHCH(CH3)COOH allowed the stereochemical dependence of the inhibitory potency to be determined. The most active isomer 17b (IC50 = 3.6 nM) is assumed to have the S,S,S stereochemistry, as deduced from both NMR and HPLC data. Although none of the inhibitors obtained were significantly more active than thiorphan, HSCH2CH(CH2Ph)CONHCH2COOH (IC50 = 4 nM), which interacts only with the S'1 and S'2 subsites of NEP, their enhanced hydrophobicity is expected to improve their pharmacokinetic properties. All these compounds displayed low affinities for ACE (IC50s > 1 microM). The determination of the IC50s of two inhibitors of series II for NEP and for a mutated enzyme in which Arg102 was replaced by Glu102 allowed their mode of binding to the active site of NEP to be characterized. The R2 and R3 chains fit the S'1-S'2 subsites, while the R4 group is probably located outside the active site. Taken together these results indicate that the R1 chain of these inhibitors creates no additional stabilizing interactions with the active site of NEP. Two hypotheses may account for this: there is no hydrophobic S1 subsite in NEP or the inhibitors have structures which are too constrained for optimized interactions with the active site.",

    "110": "The syndrome of congestive heart failure may result from either systolic or diastolic dysfunction of the left ventricle. Diastolic left ventricle dysfunction is particularly common in the geriatric age group, and is associated with left ventricular hypertrophy resulting from aging and hypertension. The clinical differentiation of these two patterns is important in understanding the pathophysiologic process and in selecting appropriate therapy. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are useful in systolic dysfunction, both in improving clinical manifestations of reduced cardiac output and in actually prolonging survival. ACE inhibitors are also beneficial in diastolic heart failure by promoting regression of left ventricular hypertrophy, thus improving diastolic physiological function. Calcium antagonists improve diastolic function by reducing blood pressure of hypertensive subjects, reducing left ventricular mass, and theoretically, by facilitating the energy-dependent transport of calcium ions from the actin-myosin complex into the sarcoplasmic reticulum. However, because of the negative inotropic properties of the calcium antagonists, they should be used cautiously, if used at all, in patients with significant systolic dysfunction, at least until the results of clinical trials using these drugs in systolic congestive heart failure are available.", 
    "111": "The pathophysiology of the syndrome of congestive heart failure (CHF) is different in elderly patients compared to middle-aged subjects. When the syndrome of CHF predominantly results from left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction, peripheral mechanisms in elderly patients are less apt to compensate for the decline in LV performance due to deconditioning of the skeletal muscles, decreased vasodilatory response to exercise, and reduced capacity to excrete sodium. These all develop with age. LV diastolic dysfunction, i.e., LV filling impairment, appears to be a more frequent cause of CHF in elderly patients than in middle-aged subjects. Hypertrophy of the cardiac myocyte is associated with a prolongation of the calcium transient which, in turn, results from a decreased concentration of the enzyme responsible for reuptake of calcium in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Cardiac myocyte hypertrophy results from a steady loss of myocytes and a progressive rise in arterial impedance which are both observed with aging. Notwithstanding subendocardial myocardial ischemia which is frequently associated with LV wall hypertrophy, prolongation of the calcium transient leads to impaired LV wall relaxation and the syndrome of LV diastolic dysfunction. The goals of therapy are also different in elderly patients compared to middle-aged patients. In elderly patients, one is less concerned about restoring a near normal exercise capacity, and aims at preventing acute episodes of decompensation which frequently accompany excessive sodium intake. Therefore, strict adherence to diet and careful titration of the dosages of medication to renal function are important considerations when treating CHF in elderly patients. In particular, cardiac glycosides, which should be avoided with CHF due to LV diastolic dysfunction, should be carefully titrated to creatinine clearance and body weight when treating elderly patients with LV systolic dysfunction in sinus rhythm. Similarly, the dosages of most angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors should be reduced in elderly patients.", 
    "112": "In this work, a selection of children was examined based on their free erythrocyte protoporphyrin (FEP) and total blood lead (PbB) contents. Two groups with clear differences in lead sensibility were selected. One group with high FEP levels (deep lead alteration), named \"normal,\" and one group with low FEP levels (discrete lead alteration), named \"lead tolerant,\" and both with similar PbB concentration, were formed. The selection, based on FEP level, showed a correlation with other indicators (neuromotor alterations). A lower activity of the enzymes Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GA3PD), Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD), and Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was found in the normal group when compared to the tolerant group. Therefore, the influence of the lead acetate upon the same erythrocyte enzyme activities was investigated. Lead inhibition of the enzymes GA3PD and G6PD was found, and this inhibition could be related to the free lead content found in the erythrocytes. Inhibition of the enzymes 6PGD and LDH was also found, but these enzymes were not inhibited by exposure to lead acetate. Erythrocyte free lead content was high in the normal group when compared to the lead tolerant group and could be a determinant factor in the biochemical alterations found. Low erythrocyte free lead contents could be an indicator of lead tolerance. TCA-precipitation was found to be a useful method to evaluate free lead content; it gave similar results to gel filtration molecular chromathography.",

    "114": "Apart from near normal metabolic control, early treatment of an increase in blood pressure in diabetic patients with nephropathy, is one of the most important therapeutic methods to prevent further progression of this complication. Long-term studies, recently published, suggest that ACE inhibitors have a beneficial effect on albuminuria and progression of nephropathy, irrespective of their hemodynamic effects. However, the mechanism by which ACE inhibitors exert these positive effects on glomerular pathology is still unclear. Several non-hemodynamic factors have been identified as being involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy: (a) changes in the composition of glomerular basement membrane due to a changed metabolism of the proteins which make up this structure; consequences are an impairment of the filtration properties, onset of proteinuria as well as thickening of basement membrane; (b) Mesangial expansion due to an overproduction of mesangial matrix and deposition of proteins as well as (c) impairment of mesangial clearance function; consequences are development of glomerulosclerosis and reduction of filtration surface. It is known that the renin-angiotensin-system is stimulated in diabetic patients with nephropathy and that angiotensin II influences the synthesis of glomerular and mesangial proteins as well as the function of mesangial cells. Hypothetically, these points could explain the beneficial effects of ACE-inhibitors on the progression of diabetic nephropathy.",

Studies in animal models of hypertensive renal disease have provided insights into the complex relationship between systemic and glomerular hypertension. The intrarenal renin-angiotensin system (RAS) appears to play an important role in the pathogenesis of progressive glomerular injury. Thus, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) may have a specific therapeutic advantage in the treatment of hypertension associated with progressive renal disease. However, in contrast to their possible renoprotective effect in diabetic nephropathy or in renal hypertension, there are increasing evidence that, in the presence of a reduction in renal perfusion, intrarenal haemodynamic effect of ACEi may lead to compromised renal function. ACEi appear to have dual effects on renal function depending on the setting in which they are administered.", 
    "124": "The role of renin-angiotensin system in the development of atherosclerosis is not yet defined, even though several actions of angiotensin II have been suggested as contributing to the development of the atherosclerotic lesion. Local renin-angiotensin system may exert a variety of autocrine or paracrine influences on vascular tissue leading to important trophic and growth regulatory effects and participating to well known events in atherogenesis as control of smooth muscle cell growth and proliferation. The existence and the specific function of components of this system in blood vessels wall suggest its possible involvement in atherosclerotic process. On these bases, the antiatherogenic properties of ACE-inhibitors have been recently evaluated in animal models where a protective effect of ACE-inhibition over the development of experimental atherosclerotic lesions has been observed. This favorable effect could follow the antihypertensive action of ACE-inhibitors even whether other potential mechanisms, including prevention of angiotensin II-induced vascular proliferation and interference with sympathetic nervous system activity and insulin sensitivity, have to be considered. Despite some clear-cut experimental evidences, the clinical importance of such findings as well as the precise mechanisms by which ACE-inhibition is able to interfere with the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis is still matter of debate and need to be assessed in future investigations.", 
    "125": "Coronary hemodynamics were investigated invasively at rest and during handgrip exercise in two groups of mild essential hypertensive subjects and in one group of renovascular hypertensive patients. The former subjects received either furosemide (50 mg/day for one week) to ensure activation of the renin-angiotensin system or an intravenous infusion of angiotensin II (AngII) at a subpressor dose (3 ng/kg/min for 15 minutes) and at a pressor dose (13 ng/kg/min for 15 minutes). Furosemide induced a significant reduction in coronary blood flow (CBF), a significant increase in coronary vascular resistance (CVR) and also blunted the increase in CBF during handgrip exercise. Captopril restored CBF and CVR to pretreatment values. Infusion of the subpressor dose of AngII decreased myocardial oxygen supply, both at rest and during exercise; the pressor dose increased myocardial oxygen supply at rest and blunted the expected increase in myocardial oxygen supply during exercise. Converting-enzyme inhibition in renovascular hypertension caused mean arterial pressure to decrease and CBF to increase significantly. The performance of handgrip exercise after cilazapril resulted in higher increases in CBF for a given increase in myocardial oxygen requirements. These data suggest that there is a negative interference by abnormally high plasma levels AngII with myocardial perfusion and that the AngII-induced effects on coronary hemodynamics are reversed by converting enzyme inhibition.", 
    "126": "To clarify the role of vascular endothelial cells (VEC) and smooth muscle cells (VSMC) in the generation of angiotensin (Ang) II, we measured the Ang II forming activity of these cells in culture using synthetic Ang I and tridecapeptide renin substrate (13RS). Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity was demonstrated in both types of cells, and the Ang I converting activity was highly sensitive to an ACE inhibitor. Both VEC and VSMC were able to generate Ang II from 13RS independently of ACE and renin. The activity was partially inhibited by chymostatin. It is suggested that Ang I could be converted to Ang II not only by VEC but also by VSMC. Both VEC and VSMC possess alternate Ang II forming pathways independent of ACE and renin.", 
    "127": "Left ventricular hypertrophy constitutes an essential risk factor for sudden death, myocardial infarction and heart failure. The death rates of patients with ECG-demonstrated cardiac hypertrophy are 4.8 times as high as those of healthy subjects. Cardiac hypertrophy is associated with a substantially increased incidence of ventricular arrhythmias. The condition is treatable in most patients. While the most effective group of drugs for controlling cardiac hypertrophy are ACE inhibitors; methyldopa, calcium antagonists, and beta-blockers have also proved useful in the management of cardiac hypertrophy in hypertension. Diuretics other than indapamide are not appropriate for treating cardiac hypertrophy. An additional benefit of ACE inhibitor administration is they can favourable affect increased levels of collagen in the hypertrophic myocardium. The prognosis of hypertensive patients, whose treatment has lead to regression in cardiac hypertrophy in hypertension, is markedly better than that of patients in whom regression fails to be achieved. A role in the development of cardiac hypertrophy in hypertension, in addition to the blood pressure level, is played by a number of mechanisms; it is the genetic factor which has received most attention recently. As the prognosis of hypertrophic patients has been found to correlate more closely with left ventricular weight, determined by echocardiography, than with blood pressure, echocardiography should be employed more often in the future to help optimize antihypertensive therapy.", 
    "128": "The null hypothesis of this study was that the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, captopril and teprotide, would not reduce the number of ovulations in vivo and in vitro in the rat. Captopril (in three regimens) was administered continuously beginning prior to pregnant mare's serum gonadotropin and hCG to trigger ovulation. The number of in vivo ovulations were counted. Ovaries similarly primed with pregnant mare's serum gonadotropin were dissected and perfused in media with hCG and captopril (two regimens) or teprotide (one regimen). The number of in vitro ovulations and steroid production in the perfusions were evaluated. The results were evaluated by the Student's t test. Power calculations gave only a 20% chance of missing a 16% difference in ovulations or steroidogenesis. There was no inhibition of ovulation or change in steroid production in angiotensin-converting enzyme treated rats in vivo or in vitro. While angiotensin II has been shown to be an important mediator in the mechanism of ovulation, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition via captopril or teprotide does not result in angiotensin II antagonistic effects. Hypothetical mechanisms to explain this paradox are presented.", 
    "129": "Glomerular hyperfiltration and hypertension may contribute to the progression of chronic renal insufficiency regardless of the underlying disease. Protein restriction and antihypertensive treatment are used to slow the decline in renal function. However, little is known about the interaction of protein loading and antihypertensive treatment on glomerular haemodynamics in humans. This paper compares the renal haemodynamic effects of beta-adrenoceptor blockers with those of the calcium channel antagonist nifedipine and the ACE inhibitor captopril on resting glomerular filtration and during glomerular hyperfiltration. In two separate studies the effects of nifedipine, captopril, metoprolol, and celiprolol on renal haemodynamics have been investigated. In two groups of healthy volunteers (n = 13) inulin and PAH clearances were measured, first under fasting conditions and afterwards during aminoacid infusion. In fasting subjects nifedipine and metoprolol induced glomerular hyperfiltration, while celiprolol and captopril did not significantly affect GFR. Without premedication, and also after nifedipine, metoprolol and celiprolol, the aminoacid infusion significantly increased the GFR. After premedication with captopril, however, aminoacid-induced hyperfiltration was prevented. In fasting subjects captopril, celiprolol and metoprolol elevated PAH clearance. With our without premedication aminoacid infusion increased renal plasma flow compared to baseline on the control day. We conclude that in healthy subjects, acute administration of antihypertensive drugs results in different renal haemodynamic responses. In contrast to captopril and celiprolol, nifedipine and metoprolol induce glomerular hyperfiltration like protein loading. Thus, they may counteract the renal haemodynamic effects of protein restriction. Celiprolol behaves similarly to captopril, since it increases renal perfusion without inducing glomerular hyperfiltration, a pattern which might reflect lower glomerular pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Patients had essential mild to moderate hypertension (94 mmHg < supine DBP < 115 mmHg) associated or not with obesity (34%), diabetes (12%), hypercholesterolemia (36%), smoking habits (24%). Mean hypertension duration was 6.5 years, 70 p. cent of patients were 50 to 69 years old and 12 p. cent 70 years old or more. Perindopril was started at 4 mg except in older and patients with renal insufficiency (2 mg). If supine DBP remained > 90 mmHg the dose was doubled up to 8 mg/day, then a thiazide diuretic was added. Monotherapy was held in 90 p. cent of cases all along the study, more than 8 over 10 times at 2 or 4 mg/day. Normalized patients (DBP < or = 90 mmHg) were 69.87 and 95 p. cent respectively at the first, third and sixth month. Mean supine SBP and DBP decrease were 27.3 and 18.0 mmHg. Antihypertensive activity was similar in patients taking psychotrope or non steroidal anti-inflammatory agents and in others, as well as in older (> or = 70 years), diabetics and obeses, however with a significantly more frequent bitherapy in these last three sub-groups. Cough, a well known side effect of ACEI led to withdrawal in only 2.6 p. cent of cases. Withdrawals for side-effect were more frequent in older patients (6.1%), in those taking psychotrope (5.3%) or non steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (6.0%) than in diabetics (4.1%) or the others (4.1%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "131": "Single measurement during a visit and the calculation of blood pressure pattern from an ambulatory record are different criteria for evaluation of the efficacy of antihypertensive treatment. Results obtained by these two methods were compared in a controlled trial. Acebutolol or enalapril were given double-blind to 17 patients with uncomplicated moderate essential hypertension. After a two week run-in period (with dummy treatment), patients were allocated at random into two parallel groups. They took acebutolol (400 mg) or enalapril (20 mg) as a single daily dose for 3 months. Ambulatory measurement of blood pressure for 24 hours (Spacelabs 5200 SPM) was carried out the day prior to final inclusion, and at the end of the first then the third month of active treatment. A single measurement of blood pressure took place at the same times. Safety/acceptability of treatment based upon clinical and laboratory parameters was good. At inclusion, single measurements showed that all patients had a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) over 95 mmHg. However, ambulatory BP was significantly lower in the enalapril group. With treatment, the fall in DBP by single measurement was significant only at the first month with enalapril and at the third month with acebutolol while the effects of both drugs were significant on ambulatory systolic blood pressure (SBP) and DBP by the first month. Ambulatory BP revealed a superior antihypertensive action of acebutolol on SBP at the third month but this was not shown by single BP measurements. These results confirm the specificity of trial protocols of antihypertensive drugs based upon ambulatory BP measurements.", 
    "132": "Isradipine is a new dihydropyridine-derived calcium antagonist. It possesses marked vascular selectivity, resulting in a powerful vasodilating action, whereas, in practical terms, it is devoid of cardiac effects. The usefulness of isradipine in the treatment of arterial hypertension is well documented, both when used as single-drug treatment and in combination with other agents, particularly, beta-blockers. Isradipine is well tolerated and does not negatively affect quality of life or capacity for physical exercise. It does not cause metabolic disturbances and, apart from the typical dihydropyridine-type vascular side-effects, specifically, flushing and ankle oedema, there are no specific adverse effects. Even ankle oedema is apparently relatively rare with this compound. Studies in animal models show that isradipine has a potent anti-atherosclerotic effect, and a brain tissue-preserving effect after experimental stroke, in doses that are relevant for antihypertensive treatment. If such results can be confirmed in humans, they will undoubtedly be of great clinical importance.", 
    "133": "Cardiac output (CO) and peripheral resistance (PR), the two major determinants of systemic arterial blood pressure (BP), are regulated principally by the adrenergic (ADR) and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) systems. Antihypertensive medications ultimately decrease CO, PR, or both, by acting at various sites in the ADR and RAA pathways or affecting cardiovascular functions directly. Beta-ADR-receptor blockers decrease heart rate (HR) and stroke volume (SV) by preventing the cardiostimulating effects of catecholamines and inhibiting renin release. Alpha-ADR-receptor blockers prevent the vasoconstricting effects of catecholamines and reduce PR (afterload). Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) block the formation of angiotensin, a potent peripheral vasoconstrictor and aldosterone releaser. Hence, ACEI cause a decrease in both PR and CO, the latter by preventing salt and water retention by aldosterone, thereby reducing plasma volume and venous return. Direct vasorelaxation and, thus, a fall in PR can be achieved by vasodilators. These include drugs (e.g. calcium antagonists) that prevent the entry of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle cells, and others (e.g. nitrovasodilators) that boost the intracellular levels of vasodilating second messengers (e.g. cyclic GMP). Antihypertensives from different classes are often combined to improve the ratio between therapeutic and adverse effects.", 
    "134": "ACE inhibitors, which till recently were used almost exclusively for treatment of cardiovascular diseases, are becoming a perspective group of drugs also in the treatment of nephropathies. It was found that they are effective in particular in the treatment of proteinuria of varying origin and have also a marked renoprotective effect and are therefore recommended to retard progression of renal failure. They reduce intraglomerular hypertension, increase glomerular filtration and the renal blood flow, and it is assumed that they can retard progression of chronic glomerulonephritis and diabetic nephropathy. We may expect already in the near future that their therapeutic application will be substantially extended also in clinical nephrology.", 
    "135": "The endothelium is a physical barrier between the blood and vascular smooth muscle, a source of enzymes activating and deactivating cardiovascular hormones and a site of production of relaxing and contracting factors. In addition, the endothelium is a source of growth inhibitors and promoters of vascular smooth muscle cells. Monoaminooxidase deactivates catecholamines and serotonin. Angiotensin converting enzyme transforms angiotensin I into angiotensin II and breaks down bradykinin into inactive products. Nitric oxide is a potent vasodilator and inhibitor of platelet function that under most circumstances is released together with prostacyclin, which exerts similar effects. Both substances play an important protective role in the coronary circulation in that they cause continuous vasodilation and inhibition of platelet function. In addition, the endothelium is a source of contracting factors such as endothelin-1, thromboxane A2, and endoperoxides. Endothelium-derived growth inhibitors include heparin (sulfates) and transforming growth factor beta 1, while basic fibroblast growth factors and platelet-derived growth factor and possibly endothelin promote proliferation. Because of its strategic anatomic position, the endothelium is a primary target for injuries and cardiovascular risk factors. In particular, aging, low density lipoproteins, hypertension, diabetes, and ischemia alter endothelium function. In arterial coronary bypass grafts, the release of nitric oxide is more pronounced than in vein grafts. Alterations of endothelial function may contribute to vasospasm, thrombus formation, and vascular proliferation and in turn myocardial ischemia, all common events in patients with coronary artery disease.",

Accuracy of Duplex/Angiography in the measurement of the renal stenosis degree. 2. Correlationship between Duplex ans Isotopic Renogram with respect to the study of the parenchyma's perfusion. 3. The effect of the inhibitors of the conversor enzyme (Captopril) on the Doppler signal of the parenchyma, comparing it with the results from the captopril test about the peripheral plasmatic renin activity and the isotopic renogram, in patients with vasculo-renal HTA. Results obtains by Duplex and Angiography were compared in 92 renal arteries from 46 patients. For both technics, three degrees of stenosis were established: 0-59%, 60-99% and occlusion. The Duplex technique identified 49/54 stenosis < 60%, 28/33 stenosis > 60% and 5/5 occlusions (Kappa 0.8). Sensibility and specificity of Duplex for the diagnosis of stenosis > 60% were, respectively, 89.5% and 90.7%; with an exactness of 90.2%. The angiographies showed stenosis > 60% in 23 patients with HTA (diastolic pressures > 100 mmHg). In all of the patients, a measurement of the plasmatic renin activity, an isotopic renogram and a Doppler of the interlobar arteries basal and post-captopril, were performed. The correlationship between Duplex and isotopic renogram with respect to the measurement of the relative renal perfusion was statistically significant (r = 0.91; p < 0.0001). The captopril test for renin and isotopic renogram were positives for 5 patients (4 with unilateral stenosis an 1 with bilateral stenosis). All of them showed severe stenosis (> 80%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "137": "This laboratory has previously reported that angiotensin II is a growth factor for human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, and that a variety of converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II antagonists reduce thymidine incorporation into the DNA of these cells. In the present study, insulin, at 5 micrograms/mL, was found to stimulate thymidine incorporation in SH-SY5Y cells. The insulin effect was only partially inhibited by the converting enzyme inhibitors enalapril, quinapril, and quinaprilat, whereas it was markedly or totally blunted by the angiotensin II antagonists DuP753 and PD123177. In additional studies, IGF-1 (50 ng/mL) significantly stimulated thymidine incorporation into these cells in a fashion indistinguishable from that of insulin. Taken together, these studies are consistent with the suggestion that insulin at high concentrations and IGF at low concentrations enhance the proliferative response of these cells to angiotensin II. The differential effects of converting enzyme inhibition and angiotensin II antagonism on cell proliferation could be explained if converting enzyme inhibition results in low, but effective, levels of angiotensin II in the culture medium, whereas the angiotensin II antagonists effectively block angiotensin II at its receptor. Finally, in this system, both the AT1 receptor blocking agent DuP 753 and the AT2 receptor blocking agent PD123177 appear to be effective.",

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of the long-acting angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril in patients with insulin-dependent or non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, the authors conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. After a single-blind washout period, 58 patients were randomly assigned to receive 2.5 mg of ramipril or a 2.5-mg placebo, each once daily. Each patient underwent titration and maintenance phases for a total treatment period of 12 weeks. By the end of maintenance, 54% of patients maintained the target blood pressure 24 hours after receiving ramipril compared with 19% in the placebo group (P = 0.008). Between baseline and the end of maintenance, ramipril decreased mean supine systolic/diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP) measured 24 hours after the last dose by 9/8 mmHg (P < or = 0.001/P < or = 0.001); placebo decreased SBP/DBP by 2/4 mmHg (NS/P < or = 0.05). Between-group differences were significant (P < 0.05). During this time, blood glucose, hemoglobin Alc, lipoproteins, and biochemistry were unchanged in the ramipril group. There were no between-group differences in the number or types of adverse events. In our study of patients with diabetes mellitus, once-daily ramipril controlled blood pressure, was well tolerated, and had no effects on carbohydrate or lipid metabolism.", 
    "140": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have proved to be valuable, life-saving medications in the management of heart failure. While reducing myocardial oxygen consumption, they increase cardiac output and thus renal plasma flow. Despite reports in the literature of adverse effects of these drugs on renal function, the risks of functional deterioration are predictable in patient populations and remediable. Patients at greatest risk of declining renal function during therapy with ACE inhibitors are those in whom maintenance of renal function is dependent on angiotensin II. Reducing the dose of the concomitant diuretic, liberalizing the dietary intake of sodium, and increasing the dose of the ACE inhibitor usually restores renal function to baseline. In patients with severe renal insufficiency, reducing the dose of the ACE inhibitor might be necessary to preserve the glomerular filtration rate.", 
    "141": "Outcome in 81 pediatric patients with dilated cardiomyopathy was reviewed to assess whether treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors affected survival. Age at onset was 3.6 +/- 0.6 years. Twenty-seven children (group 1) were treated with ACE inhibitors. Conventional therapy was used in the remaining 54 patients (group 2). There were no significant differences between the two groups in age at onset, left ventricular shortening fraction, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, or mean pulmonary artery pressure. Patients treated with ACE inhibitors had a significantly better survival during the first year (p < 0.05) with continuation of this trend throughout the second year (p = 0.06). Beyond 2 years there was a tendency toward better survival in ACE inhibitor-treated patients, but the differences were no longer significant (p = 0.14). These data, along with observations in adult patients with chronic cardiac failure, indicate that converting enzyme inhibitors have a beneficial effect on prolonging survival of infants and children with severe left ventricular dysfunction from dilated cardiomyopathy.",

We also measured angiotensin-converting enzyme activity. Each subject took 2 mg of perindopril after a 4-hour haemodialysis. Serial blood samples were obtained each hour during dialysis and between dialysis (7 samples over 44 h). Perindoprilat steady state was reached within 5 haemodialysis sessions. There was a high degree of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition after the first dose. Administration for 1 month did not modify the time to peak perindoprilat concentration but significantly increased the mean maximal concentration: 10.2 versus 26.8 ng.ml-1. The mean accumulation ratio was 3.5. The mean reduction in perindoprilat concentration after dialysis was greater than 50%. Perindoprilat haemodialysis clearance was 62 ml.min-1 after the first administration and 72 ml.min-1 after 1 month. Tolerance of perindopril was good throughout the study. Treatment can be begun with 2 mg of perindopril after haemodialysis in hypertensive patients undergoing haemodialysis.", 
    "143": "Pharmacokinetic studies are often used to provide additional information regarding the use of pharmacological agents for the treatment of cardiovascular disorders. Pharmacokinetic data are available for the major angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. However, practical guidelines regarding dosage and dosage intervals are not feasible, and measurements of serum drug concentrations are generally not useful in practice. Such use is obscured by the nature of enzymatic inhibition, renin and angiotensin I accumulation, the complex interaction of several organ systems, the compromise of organ system function due to the heart failure process, the effect of ACE inhibitors on other vasoactive substances and the cellular actions of carboxypeptidase (the enzyme otherwise known as ACE). Pharmacodynamic data demonstrate 2 important factors that influence ACE inhibitor pharmacokinetics and serum concentrations: the aging process and abnormal renal function. As most patients with moderate to severe heart failure have reduced renal function, this has practical implications. Furthermore, heart failure is common in the elderly, and even within the population with heart failure, a superimposed further reduction in renal function can be identified in elderly patients with heart failure. Therefore, a more careful analysis of ACE inhibitor dosage must be made in the presence of decreased renal function and in the elderly patient with heart failure.", 
    "144": "1. The effects of captopril and enalapril on skin responses to intradermal injections of bradykinin and skin blood flow in the forearm were investigated in this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. 2. Intradermal injections of 0, 1, 2.5 and 5 micrograms of bradykinin in 0.9% sodium chloride were made into the forearm of twelve healthy volunteers before and at 2, 6 and 24 h after single oral doses of 25 mg captopril, 10 mg enalapril or placebo. Forearm skin blood flow was measured by the technique of laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) before the injections were made and the skin responses evaluated at 15 min after injections of bradykinin by measurement of cutaneous blood flow outside the induced weal, erythema area and weal volume. 3. The bradykinin-induced cutaneous responses measured by LDF, erythema area and weal volume increased with incremental bradykinin dose. Compared with placebo, captopril significantly augmented the cutaneous vasodilator effects of bradykinin, measured by LDF and erythema area, at 2 h and the weal responses at 2 and 6 h. Enalapril enhanced the vasodilator responses to bradykinin at 2 and 6 h and the weal responses at 2, 6 and 24 h. Neither captopril nor enalapril significantly affected forearm skin blood flow. 4. This study showed that captopril and enalapril potentiated the effects of intradermal bradykinin both with respect to blood flow changes and weal formation in keeping with effective kininase II inhibition and the time course of these changes are consistent with enalapril being a longer acting drug than captopril. Captopril and enalapril exerted no influence on forearm skin blood flow measured by LDF.", 
    "145": "Hyperlipidemic Imai rats spontaneously develop hypercholesterolemia, proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis. The aim of the present study was to clarify whether two different antihypertensive regimens (enalapril and a combination of reserpine, hydralazine and hydrochlorothiazide) would offer similar degrees of protection against glomerular injury in male hyperlipidemic Imai rats. Group 1 (n = 4) received no specific therapy. Group 2 (n = 4) was treated with enalapril at a dose of 50 mg/l in drinking water starting at 6 weeks of age. Group 3 (n = 5) was treated with the triple drug regimen (reserpine 5 mg/l, hydralazine 80 mg/l and hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg/l in drinking water). Body weight, blood pressure, urinary protein, serum albumin, cholesterol, BUN and serum creatinine were checked and compared among groups. Although enalapril and triple drug therapy were almost equally effective in controlling systemic hypertension, there were striking differences between the two treated groups in proteinuria, hypercholesterolemia and glomerular injury. Enalapril treatment significantly reduced proteinuria (731 +/- 23 vs. 256 +/- 144 mg/kg/day at 36 week; p < 0.005) and hypercholesterolemia (264 +/- 17 vs. 104 +/- 17 mg/dl at 38 weeks; p < 0.001). Triple drug therapy failed to prevent the development of proteinuria (909 +/- 75 mg/kg/day at 38 weeks) and hypercholesterolemia (330 +/- 61 mg/dl at 38 weeks).

    "146": "To evaluate the usefulness of the captopril test for identifying renal artery stenosis (RAS) and renovascular hypoplasia (RAH), we studied 48 hypertensive patients. In 20 hypertensives with screening procedures indicating renovascular disease and in 28 essential hypertensives (EH), the plasma renin activity (PRA) responses to an oral test dose of captopril (50 mg) were studied. A 60-min post-captopril PRA increase of 150% (or 400% if baseline PRA < or = 3 ng/ml/h) was considered as positive. Renal angiography was performed in all cases. Among the 20 renovascular hypertensive patients, RAH in 9 and RAS in 11 subjects were proved by angiography. The captopril test in all patients with RAH resulted negative (mean PRA increase 50%); furthermore, the test identified 7 of the 11 RAS (mean PRA increase 477.6%); sensitivity and specificity for RAS were 64 and 88.8%, respectively. In the EH group, there were 3 false-positive subjects (mean PRA increase 122%). This study demonstrates that the PRA responses to a test dose of captopril are a useful screening test for distinguishing RAH from RAS, and for identifying the latter in hypertensive patients. These data also suggest that in subjects with RAH, hypertensive disease may not renin dependent.", 
    "147": "In the conscious freely moving rat, the intrathecal (i.t.) injection of neuropeptide K (NPK; 0.65 to 6.5 nmol), at T-9 spinal cord level, produced dose-dependent and prolonged (> 3 h) increases in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR). The cardiovascular response to 3.25 nmol NPK was less sustained when injected at T-2 level. The cardiovascular response to 3.25 nmol NPK (T-9 level) was correlated with increases in plasma levels of noradrenaline, adrenaline and neuropeptide Y (NPY), and was significantly reduced by the prior i.v. administration of inhibitors of either alpha-adrenoceptors (1 mg/kg, phentolamine), alpha 1-adrenoceptors (1 mg/kg, prazosin), beta 1-adrenoceptors (1 mg/kg, metoprolol) or angiotensin converting enzyme (10 mg/kg, captopril). The cardiovascular response to NPK was also significantly reduced in rats that had undergone, 48 h earlier, bilateral adrenalectomy or to a greater extent sympathectomy with 6-hydroxydopamine. Whereas NPK-induced release of adrenaline was abolished by adrenalectomy, that of neuropeptide Y and noradrenaline was blunted by either treatment. The results suggest that the cardiovascular effect of i.t. NPK is mediated by the stimulation of the sympathoadrenal system and the release of angiotensin. Sympathetic fibers may play a greater role than the adrenal medulla in the cardiovascular response to NPK. It appears that neuropeptide Y derives from both sympathetic fibers and adrenal medullae. Hence, if released in the spinal cord, NPK may play an important role in cardiovascular and sympathoadrenal regulation.",

Because remodelling begins very early and is a staged and progressive pathophysiological process, timing and duration of therapy are likely to have a profound effect on outcome. Different outcomes can be expected depending on whether therapy is begun very early (during the infarction process), early (after completion of the infarction process but before significant deposition of infarct collagen has occurred), late (after infarct collagen has peaked and infarct healing is completed) or very late (after healing is completed). Different outcomes can also be expected with therapy that spans one or more of these stages. Maximum benefit might be expected from therapy that is begun very early, spans the entire healing process and extends beyond. Two-dimensional echocardiograms can be used to assess the impact of therapies on remodelling and function. Very early thrombolysis and low dose intravenous nitroglycerin followed by prolonged angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and/or nitrate appear to be a very promising algorithm.",

    "156": "It has been well documented that different therapeutic strategies, including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and dietary protein restriction, lower urinary protein excretion in patients with diabetic and non-diabetic nephropathy. Experimental evidence suggests that this antiproteinuric effect is, at least in part, related to a reduction in the glomerular capillary hydraulic pressure. ACE inhibitors appear to achieve this reduction in glomerular capillary pressure, mainly through a fall in postglomerular arteriolar resistance, whereas dietary protein restriction and non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs appear to invoke the response predominantly through an increase in preglomerular resistance. This leads to the suggestion that both \"glomerular preload reduction\" (afferent vasoconstriction) and \"glomerular afterload reduction\" (efferent vasodilation) will result in an anti-proteinuric response. Interestingly, these same therapeutic regimens, particularly the ACE inhibitors and low-protein diets, have been proven to prevent progressive glomerulosclerosis in animal models. This concept of influencing glomerular hemodynamics both at the afferent and efferent arteriolar level may open new perspectives in the treatment of patients with renal protein loss and renal failure. At present, however, it is too early to conclude whether the fall in proteinuria induced by these treatments will also contribute to a better renal survival of these patients.",

Through the improvement of these parameters, the treatment reduced the incidence of stroke but did not suppress the development of hypertension.

Alterations in cutaneous blood flow were estimated by laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) and erythema area. LDF output, erythema area and weal volume increased with incremental bradykinin dose. Single doses of indomethacin 25 mg and 75 mg did not affect these cutaneous responses compared with placebo. Captopril 25 mg significantly potentiated the increase in local cutaneous blood flow measured by LDF, but not erythema area, and weal volume induced by bradykinin. The effects of the combined treatment of indomethacin 75 mg and captopril 25 mg were not significantly different from those due to captopril alone. The enhanced cutaneous effects of bradykinin following administration of captopril are in keeping with effective kininase II inhibition in the tissues.

In the young men zabicipril did not affect Q, heart rate (HR), systemic arterial pressure (AP) or GFR, but it did increase RPF at the 4th hour after the highest dose (from 540 to 653 ml.min-1.m-2). In the old men zabicipril had similar actions, but the effect of the highest dose on RPF (from 355 to 415 ml.min-1.m-2) was less marked than in the young men. In the young and old men the inhibition of ACE peaked at about of 90% or more from the 2th to the 4th hour after the highest dose of zabicipril. We conclude that, in normal men, zabicipril increases the renal fraction of cardiac output in the absence of a concomitant change in systemic haemodynamics. This specific effect of zabicipril on the kidney may be less important with advancing age.", 
    "160": "A randomised crossover study has been done to compare the antihypertensive efficacy of enalapril and atenolol in 45 smoking, hypertensive men. Treatment was started with enalapril 20 mg/d or atenolol 50 mg/d and, if necessary, the doses were doubled after 4 weeks to achieve a sitting diastolic blood pressure < or = 95 mm Hg, after which hydrochlorothiazide was added, if necessary. Both drugs lowered blood pressure significantly. However, enalapril was more efficient in lowering both systolic and diastolic blood pressure; the mean difference was significant after both 4 and 8 weeks in the sitting systolic (11.6 mm Hg and 7.9 mm Hg) and diastolic (3.3 mm Hg and 3.0 mm Hg) pressures and in the erect systolic pressures (8.2 mm Hg and 7.2 mm Hg), and after 8 weeks in the supine systolic pressure, too (8.9 mm Hg). The effect on enalapril was especially marked in moderate (< 20 cigarettes/day) smokers. The need for diuretics was also significantly less in the enalapril group. It appears that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may be superior to beta-adrenoceptor blockers in the treatment of hypertensive smoking patients.", 
    "161": "Acute converting enzyme inhibition relaxes arterial smooth muscle and increases arterial compliance in several models of animal and human hypertension. However, it is unknown whether the doses needed for the relaxation of large arteries are similar to those inducing arteriolar relaxation and blood pressure (BP) decrease. To answer this question, we used a previously described model of the in situ carotid artery to determine the pressure-volume relationship over a range of transmural pressures from 25 to 200 mm Hg in normotensive rats (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The pressure-volume relation was determined after an acute single oral administration of either a placebo or the converting enzyme inhibitor quinapril given at two different doses (0.3 or 3 mg/kg). At the end of each experiment, the total relaxation of arterial smooth muscle was achieved after a local administration of potassium cyanide (KCN). In the WKY placebo group, from 25 to 100-125 mm Hg transmural pressure, carotid compliance increased and reached a maximum value at 100-125 mm Hg (i.e. close to the operating range of systemic mean BP of the animals), and decreased thereafter. In the SHR placebo group, carotid compliance was significantly lower than in the WKY placebo group for transmural pressure up to 125 mm Hg, and thereafter was equal or even higher; the maximum value of compliance was reached at 125-150 mm Hg transmural pressure, i.e. substantially less than the operating range of the systemic mean BP of the SHR placebo (180 mm Hg).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "162": "The combination of captopril and nitroglycerin early after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) could lead to a dangerous decrease in blood pressure coronary perfusion. To evaluate the safety aspects and haemodynamic effects of this combination, we studied 36 first 'Q wave' thrombolysed anterior wall AMI patients during the 24 h following the onset of symptoms. Afterwards, thrombolysis patients received a continuous infusion of nitroglycerin and were submitted to pulmonary artery catheterization. Those patients with mean arterial pressure (MAP) > or = 70 mmHg, cardiac index > or = 2.2 l.min-1.m-2, and wedge pressure > or = 10 mmHg were included and randomized to receive 6.25 mg of captopril every 6 h on the first day and 12.5 mg qid on the second if MAP > or = 70 mmHg (group 1). A second group (group 2) received a placebo. Haemodynamic parameters were determined after 1, 6 and then every 6 h up to 48 h after basal measurements. Significant differences were observed only for the MAP and the rate-pressure product (reduction in group 1 values, P < 0.05). However, MAP was maintained within acceptable limits. Our data support the fact that the combination of captopril and nitroglycerin in the early hours of a non-complicated anterior wall AMI is safe, and could guarantee its use in large clinical trials to determine the effects on left ventricle remodelling and survival after AMI.", 
    "163": "The endogenous activity of the local renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and the anti-ischaemic properties of captopril were investigated in electrically driven rabbit Langendorff hearts (constant pressure: 70 cmH2O, Tyrode solution, Ca2+ 1.8 mmol.l-1). Cumulative concentration-response curves showed no significant difference (P > 0.05) between the reduction of the global coronary flow (CF) by exogenous angiotensin-I or angiotensin-II (EC50 = 10(-10) mol.l-1). It is concluded that the local RAS in isolated rabbit hearts is highly sensitive, whereas its endogenous activity is very low due to very low endogenous angiotensin-I content. Myocardial ischaemia (MI) was induced by the occlusion of a left coronary artery branch and MI was quantified from NADH surface fluorescence photography. MI was significantly enlarged (+35%) (P < 0.05) by exogenous angiotensin-I (6 x 10(-9) mol.l-1). The reduction in CF and the increment in MI by angiotensin-I could be completely prevented by adding captopril at a low concentration (10(-6) mol.l-1) to the perfusion buffer. In the absence of exogenous angiotensin-I, captopril alone (10(-6) mol.l-1) neither significantly enhanced CF (P > 0.05), nor diminished MI (P > 0.05), supporting the finding of very low endogenous activity of the local RAS in this model. We, moreover, conclude that at a low concentration (10(-6) mol.l-1) captopril does not possess direct cardioprotective properties independent of its ACE inhibiting action.", 
    "164": "Oral premedication with enalapril, 0.1 mg/kg was compared with placebo in 22 patients subjected to craniotomy and ligation of an intracranial aneurysm or extirpation of an arteriovenous malformation. Balanced hypotensive anesthesia was used with sodium nitroprusside (SNP) as the main hypotensive agent. The hypertensive response to laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation was significantly attenuated by enalapril (p = 0.020). The mean blood pressure was lower and more stable in the intensive care unit after enalapril than after placebo (p = 0.044). The median SNP dose rate tended to be lower in the enalapril-pretreated patients [0.6 (range of 0-3.5) micrograms/kg/min] compared to the placebo group [1.4 (0.4-5.8) micrograms/kg/min] (p = 0.12). Concentrations of plasma catecholamines, vasopressin, and endothelin as well as serum osmolality, arterial blood gases, and plasma electrolytes and level of consciousness were repeatedly measured. Enalapril had no significant effects on these variables. Plasma renin activity was increased and serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity was reduced in the expected manner by enalapril. We found premedication with an ACE inhibitor favorable for hypotensive anesthesia in neurovascular patients as assessed by the circulatory responses.", 
    "165": "These experiments examined the dipsogenic responses of rats to intracerebroventricularly administered angiotensin II (ANG II) under normotensive and hypotensive conditions. Intravenous infusion of the vasodilator drug minoxidil (25 micrograms.kg-1.min-1), combined with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (0.33 mg/min), both reduced blood pressure and prevented endogenous ANG II formation. Central infusions with ANG II (4 or 16 ng/h) began 60 min later, and the intravenous and intracerebroventricular infusions ran concurrently for another 90 min. Mean arterial pressure (MAP), water intake, urine volume (UV) and electrolyte excretion were measured throughout. Water intakes to both doses of intracerebroventricular ANG II were increased, and UV and electrolyte excretion were reduced during hypotensive conditions compared with normotensive conditions. Thus the increased water intakes occurred despite increased fluid retention. It is concluded that arterial hypotension enhances the dipsogenic effects of centrally administered ANG II, possibly through baroreceptor-mediated mechanisms.", 
    "166": "The renal responses to acute blockade of the endothelial-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) resemble the renal actions of angiotensin II (ANG II), and the present studies were conducted to establish what role, if any, the endogenous renin-angiotensin system plays in mediating the renal response to acute EDRF blockade. These studies were conducted in the conscious chronically catheterized rat. In control experiments we observed that acute blockade of ANG II synthesis with converting-enzyme inhibition (CEI) led to a fall in blood pressure (BP) and a slight renal vasodilation but no significant change in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) or renal plasma flow (RPF). Urine flow and sodium excretion were unchanged by CEI. Use of the nonpeptide ANG II receptor antagonist losartan had no effect on BP, renal vascular resistance (RVR), GFR, or RPF; however, urine flow and sodium excretion did rise significantly. Because of the high specificity of losartan, this suggests that, in the normal conscious rat, endogenous ANG II does not control renal vascular tone but does enhance renal sodium reabsorption. ANG II blockade with either CEI or losartan had little effect on BP and no effect on the renal hemodynamic responses to acute EDRF blockade. The marked natriuretic and diuretic response to acute EDRF blockade persists during concomitant losartan but is abolished by CEI. These studies suggest that in the conscious rat the renal hemodynamic response to EDRF blockade is not mediated by endogenous ANG II.", 
    "167": "Arterial blood pressure and renal blood flow (RBF) fluctuations in rats were studied by autoregressive (AR) and autoregressive-moving average (ARMA) modeling. These estimation procedures provided greater sensitivity and frequency resolution than classic fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based methods and also require shorter observation periods. We estimated the transfer function of RBF autoregulation to test whether inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme impairs whole kidney dynamic autoregulation. The transfer function in control animals measured with the ARMA method was similar to transfer functions obtained previously, using FFT methods. Because of better frequency resolution, we also detected an oscillation in RBF at 50 mHz, the same frequency as an oscillation in tubular pressure and glomerular filtration rate that had been attributed to tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF), but that FFT methods had not previously found in whole kidney blood flow. Captopril increased the amplitude of RBF fluctuations and increased the gain of the transfer function at frequencies below 100 mHz, a frequency bandwidth previously associated with TGF. The increased gain indicates that TGF operates less effectively to mediate dynamic autoregulation when angiotensin conversion is inhibited. Gain at frequencies greater than 100 mHz, previously ascribed to the myogenic mechanism, was not affected by captopril. These results show that angiotensin, by modulating TGF, reduces fluctuations of RBF about the mean value.", 
    "168": "A 69-year-old woman with a history of diabetes and hypertension, was referred to the Hospital of Laredo because of hyponatraemia. She had weakness and slight dyspnoea with no evidence of extracellular fluid volume depletion or oedema. Serum sodium level on admission was 125 mol l-1, plasma osmolality 270 mosmol kg-1, simultaneous urine osmolality was 580 mosmol kg-1 and urine sodium 32.6 mmol l-1. She had been treated with enalapril (20 mg) daily for 4 months. She was diagnosed with the Syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) that was reversed after cessation of treatment with enalapril and reappeared on reintroduction of the drug at the same daily doses.", 
    "169": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been designed to block the renin-angiotensin system and can represent an effective therapeutic approach in those settings where such a system is active, such as myocardial infarction. In a randomized placebo-controlled study, 10 patients with acute myocardial infarction allocated to treatment with increasing doses of zofenopril calcium and 10 patients allocated to placebo were studied in hospital, within 24 hours from symptoms, during 11 sampling periods to assess the time course of ACE inhibition and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone blockade. Zofenopril administration was followed by a dose-dependent inhibition of in vitro ACE activity (7.5 mg, 65%; 15 mg, 89%; 30 mg, 94.5%) and a progressive increase in plasma active renin. Conversely, plasma aldosterone decreased during the first 3 days of treatment and then returned toward baseline values, as did blood pressure, despite a persistent inhibition of ACE. The present data suggest the existence of an interesting dissociation between the time-course of ACE inhibition and that of blockade of the renin-angiotensin system in patients with acute myocardial infarction. This discrepancy could arise from the combination of an only partial in vivo ACE inhibition and the compensatory increase in plasma renin that occurs during treatment with ACE inhibitors. A better understanding of this relationship would seem to be useful in addressing the correct use of ACE inhibitors in patients with acute myocardial injury.", 
    "170": "Pemphigus may be an idiopathic disease or a syndrome induced by drugs, mainly thiol drugs. Autoantibodies, always present in the idiopathic form but often lacking in the drug-induced one, may cause acantholysis by activating endogenous proteolytic enzymes. Pathogenesis of drug-induced pemphigus when antibodies are absent has not been elucidated yet. Extracts of skin tissues cultured for 4 days with penicillamine, captopril or thiopronine were assayed for the presence of plasminogen activator (PA) and plasminogen activator inhibitors (PAI) on agar fibrin plates. Moreover, uPA, tPA, and PAI-1 were identified in the extracts by immunoenzymatic assay. The results have shown progressively decreasing amounts of PAI-1 in penicillamine, thiopronine and captopril-cultured tissue extracts, respectively. This suggests that the acantholytic potential of thiol drugs is directly correlated to their capability of reducing PAI-1 in the epidermal cells leading to increased PA activity. This PA-PAI imbalance may be itself the cause of intraepidermal splitting.", 
    "171": "Despite the usefulness of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE; EC 3.4.15.1) inhibitors for patients with renal insufficiency, some hesitation has been exercised in applying ACE inhibitors to the treatment of such patients because most ACE inhibitors are excreted mainly into the urine. In this context, development of an ACE inhibitor which is excreted into the bile has been sought. The pharmacokinetic properties of the novel ACE inhibitor, temocapril hydrochloride (temocapril HCl; CS-622), were investigated in six healthy volunteers. This drug is excreted mainly into the bile in animal studies. Temocapril HCl was given in a single dose of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg, and 36, 44, and 38 per cent of the administered drug was excreted in the feces and 17, 19, and 24 per cent in the urine as the de-esterified active diacid form (the diacid metabolite) within 48 h, respectively. The plasma ACE activity was markedly inhibited. No abnormal clinical findings suggestive of side-effects were observed. Thus, from the pharmacokinetic standpoint, temocapril HCl is expected to be a useful drug for patients with renal dysfunction.", 
    "172": "Previous studies from our laboratory indicated that the lipoxygenase inhibitor phenidone markedly attenuates angiotensin II (AII) induced vascular contractility. Phenidone was also shown to inhibit the formation of vascular lipoxygenase products and to reduce blood pressure in the AII-dependent renovascular hypertensive rat. We have now examined the effects of phenidone in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR). A single dose of phenidone lowered intraarterial systolic pressure in a dose dependent manner in both SHR and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) [(max 74 +/- 15 and 22 +/- 3 mm Hg, respectively; P < .001)], but the effect was substantially greater in SHR. Long-term oral phenidone administration arrested the evolution of hypertension in 6 week old SHR treated over a period of 4 weeks (control 190 +/- 2 mm Hg; phenidone treated rats 164 +/- 4 mm Hg; P < .01). To assess the role of AII related mechanisms in the hypotensive effect of phenidone, the acute effect was studied in SHR on high and low sodium intake. In addition, the effect of captopril was compared to that of phenidone alone or captopril and phenidone in salt restricted SHR. While a single dose of phenidone (30 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) elicited similar maximal effects in SHR on high and low sodium intake (54 +/- 6 and 52 +/- 5 mm Hg compared to basal blood pressure, respectively), the hypotensive effect in sodium restricted rats was more sustained. Phenidone had no further hypotensive effect in captopril treated, salt restricted SHR.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "173": "The increase in vascular permeability associated with neurogenic inflammation in the nasal mucosa is mediated by neuropeptides such as substance P released from sensory nerves. Substance P is degraded by the peptidases neutral endopeptidase-24.11 (NEP-24.11) and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). In the present study, we used capsaicin to produce neurogenic inflammation in the nasal mucosa of rats, and we examined the effect of inhibition of NEP-24.11 by phosphoramidon, inhibition of ACE by captopril or inhibition of both enzymes by giving both inhibitors. Using as tracers intravenous Evans blue dye to quantify the extravasation and Monastral blue pigment to localize the sites of leakage, we examined the magnitude and distribution of capsaicin-induced plasma extravasation in the nasoturbinates, maxilloturbinates, ethmoidal turbinates and septum. Capsaicin caused a dose-dependent increase in Evans blue extravasation in the naso- and maxilloturbinates but had only a slight effect in the septum. The leaky blood vessels responsible for this plasma extravasation, as manifested by Monastral blue labeling, were most numerous in the naso- and maxilloturbinates, particularly near the front and free borders. After phosphoramidon, the leakage of Monastral blue was more widespread and extended in a more caudal direction. The response to capsaicin was augmented by phosphoramidon alone but not by captopril alone. However, in the presence of phosphoramidon, captopril further augmented the capsaicin-induced extravasation. We conclude that neurogenic inflammation in the rat nasal mucosa is greatest in the naso- and maxilloturbinates and can be modulated by NEP-24.11 and, to a lesser extent, by ACE.", 
    "174": "Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the major cause of death in the United States. Major modifiable risk factors for CHD are hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and cigarette smoking, with concomitant risk factors, especially left ventricular hypertrophy, that act synergistically to significantly increase overall risk. Antihypertensive therapy, while reducing the incidence of stroke, has not consistently reduced the incidence of CHD. This may be a result, in part, of adverse effects on the metabolic profile, especially on blood lipids, which are induced by diuretics and certain beta-blockers. Other antihypertensive agents appear to be either lipid neutral, such as calcium channel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, or lipid positive, such as selective alpha 1-blockers. The choice of initial antihypertensive therapy should be made with all of a patient's risk factors in mind. In addition to the drugs recommended in the 1988 Guidelines of the Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure, selective alpha 1-blockers should also be considered since they improve the lipid profile as well as reduce blood pressure.", 
    "175": "Angiotensin II promotes growth of vascular smooth muscle cells in vitro via the autocrine production of growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, and transforming growth factor-beta. Furthermore, experimental studies have demonstrated that angiotensin infusion can enhance smooth muscle proliferation after balloon injury in vivo. Consistent with this, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors have been shown to prevent myointimal proliferation. The origin of vascular angiotensin that participate in this process is of interest. We have demonstrated the presence of angiotensinogen messenger RNA (mRNA) in the adventitial and medial layers of the rat aorta and have speculated that local angiotensinogen production may play an important role during myointimal proliferation. To provide further evidence toward this hypothesis, we compared the localization and expression of angiotensinogen mRNA in control and balloon injured vessels using in situ hybridization.", 
    "176": "Abdominal aorta of Sprague-Dawley rats were studied before or after injury with a balloon catheter. Neointimal hyperplasia developed as documented morphologically by a progressive increase in the ratio of neointimal to medial thickness from 0.17 at 1 week to 1.17 at 6 weeks after injury. Angiotensinogen mRNA was detected clearly in the adventitia and media of control and injured aorta. However, at 1 week after injury, the medial-to-adventitial angiotensinogen mRNA ratio was higher in the injured aorta, suggesting increased gene expression in the media compared with control. Of potential importance, angiotensinogen mRNA was also detected in the neointima of the injured aorta, and this was also highest at 1 week after injury.",

    "178": "The evidence linking hypertension and hypercholesterolemia is strong and has fueled research into possible adverse effects of some antihypertensive agents on serum lipid profile. This multicenter, open, parallel study compares the effects of doxazosin and captopril on blood pressure, serum lipid levels, and quality of life in 224 hypercholesterolemic hypertensive patients. Blood pressure was significantly reduced in both treatment groups (p < 0.001) and was normalized (standing diastolic pressure < or = 90 mm Hg) in 73% of the doxazosin patients and 67% of the captopril group. Serum total cholesterol level was favorably reduced by both doxazosin (from 238 to 223 mg/dl, p < 0.001) and captopril (from 245 to 233 mg/dl, p < 0.001), whereas high density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration increased only in the doxazosin group (from 33 to 36 mg/dl, p < 0.001). The calculated 10-year risk for the development of coronary heart disease was reduced significantly (p < 0.001) by 28% in the doxazosin group and by 19% in the captopril group. The quality of life evaluation showed beneficial changes in both treatment groups. As a result of proven antihypertensive efficacy and a lack of unfavorable effects on lipid parameters and health status measures, these findings support the use of both doxazosin and captopril as agents of first choice in the treatment of hypertensive patients with associated lipid abnormalities.", 
    "179": "Angiotensin II (Ang II) may cause cardiovascular hypertrophy as a consequence of increased blood pressure or possibly by direct trophic actions. To dissociate Ang II and blood pressure in young spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), we used sodium loading during angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor treatment. Animals were treated between 6 and 10 weeks of age with perindopril to lower Ang II and blood pressure, or with perindopril and 1% saline drinking fluid or perindopril and aldosterone infusion to lower Ang II but maintain high blood pressure. Blood pressure, heart weight, and media/lumen ratio of mesenteric resistance arteries were studied while rats were on treatment at 10 weeks of age and 15 weeks after treatment at 25 weeks of age. Perindopril lowered blood pressure and inhibited the development of cardiovascular hypertrophy. Saline or aldosterone restored high blood pressure during perindopril treatment and resulted in increased heart weight/body weight and resistance artery media/lumen ratios in direct proportion to the elevation of blood pressure. Because increased structure occurred despite perindopril treatment, we conclude that direct trophic actions of Ang II are not essential for the development of cardiovascular hypertrophy in young SHR and that the antitrophic actions of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors depend more on changes in blood pressure than on Ang II. However, restoration of blood pressure and structure by sodium during perindopril treatment raises the possibility that the design of the cardiovascular system and blood pressure may depend indirectly on Ang II through effects on sodium metabolism.", 
    "180": "Renin secretion responds rapidly to a variety of stimuli; however, reported changes in renal renin messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in vivo have been observed only after prolonged stimulation. Studies were designed to test whether rapid changes in renin mRNA levels can be produced in vivo. In the first series, Sprague-Dawley rats received furosemide (10 mg/kg) intraperitoneally and a low sodium diet (0.05% sodium); renin secretion was significantly stimulated at 8 or 16 hours after treatment, but renin mRNA levels did not change. In a second series, rats were pretreated with deoxycorticosterone acetate (200 mg/kg) and saline drinking water for 3 days and then killed 0, 2, 4, 8, or 48 hours after furosemide administration. The renin mRNA level was unchanged at 2 hours but was stimulated twofold at 4 and 8 hours and threefold at 48 hours. In additional animals, the response of renin mRNA 4 hours after furosemide was found not to be potentiated by the converting enzyme inhibitor quinapril (5 mg/kg). The results demonstrate that with acute stimulation, renin mRNA levels lag 2-4 hours behind the change in plasma renin levels.", 
    "181": "The effects of angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitor, benazepril, on diastolic function in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, with (n = 4) or without (n = 11) mitral regurgitation, were examined with the time-volume curve of the left ventricle derived from cine magnetic resonance images. Peak filling rate/end-systolic volume and ejection fraction were increased in the group without regurgitation (p < 0.01) but not in the group with regurgitation after treatment. There was a strong correlation between peak filling rate/end-systolic volume and ejection fraction (r = 0.89) and between the change in peak filling rate/end-systolic volume and that in ejection fraction after treatment (r = 0.74) in the group without regurgitation. These findings suggest that in some patients with dilated cardiomyopathy benazepril has favorable effects on diastolic function, which seem to be related to improvement in systolic function. This drug may not be as beneficial in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy complicated by mitral regurgitation.", 
    "182": "The clinical syndrome of congestive heart failure remains a therapeutic dilemma and challenge for the physician in 1992. This is a disease process that appears to be increasing in frequency and continues to carry an unacceptably high mortality rate. For years it has been well recognized that the combination of digoxin, Lasix and vasodilator therapy improved symptoms in these patients and decreased hospitalization, but did not increase survival. It was not until 1986 that the combination of digoxin, Lasix, Isordil, and hydralazine was shown to increase survival. Further significant improvement in quality of life and survival has recently been established in three large clinical trials, and it is now safe to say that the standard of care for symptomatic congestive heart failure in 1992 is digoxin, furosemide, and an ACE inhibitor, with the survival trials favoring the ACE inhibitor enalapril. The IV inotropic drug dobutamine remains the mainstay of pharmacological therapy for the treatment of severely refractory heart failure. Unfortunately, the phosphodiesterase inhibitors--amrinone, milrinone, and enoximone--have demonstrated unacceptable clinical side effects and have been withdrawn from further clinical study. In spite of these promising developments, the mortality and morbidity of congestive heart failure remains unacceptably high, and continued investigation in the new fields of pharmacology and the pathophysiology of congestive heart failure still must be aggressively pursued.", 
    "183": "In an open, multicenter extension of a short-term study, 159 patients with mild to moderate hypertension were treated with either ramipril monotherapy or a combination of ramipril and hydrochlorothiazide for up to 1 year. Patients started with either 5 mg ramipril once daily (responders in the short-term study) or a combination of ramipril 5 mg plus hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg once daily. The dose could be adjusted and nonresponders to ramipril monotherapy could have hydrochlorothiazide added. In the 38 patients treated with ramipril monotherapy, the largest drop in mean blood pressure (BP) had already occurred in the previous short-term study; from Week 2 in the long-term study, the BP remained stable with means below 150/90 mmHg. In the 83 patients treated with the combination for 50 weeks or more, mean BP continued to decrease until around Week 10 in the long-term study while therapy was being adjusted. Thereafter, it also remained stable with means below 150/85 mmHg. Both treatment groups showed good mean reductions at end point, as did the group of 38 patients treated with the combination for less than 50 weeks. High response rates (84-95%) were seen in all groups at end point. The combination was well tolerated and the efficacy of ramipril in combination with hydrochlorothiazide was maintained over the 1-year period of investigation.", 
    "184": "When administered to a 45-year-old woman who was ill with severe hypertension, combined enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide therapy resulted in acute renal failure, leading to a successful search for renal artery stenosis. Acute renal failure as an adverse reaction to enalapril therapy occurs in approximately 20% of patients with secondary hypertension from renovascular disease. On the other hand, in a group of essential hypertensives this occurs at a rate of approximately 0.2%. Thus, a likelihood ratio of 100 is produced, and given the prevalence of renovascular hypertension of approximately 2% in all hypertensives, a posterior probability of 0.67 can be calculated. The occurrence of this adverse effect should indicate that a diagnostic work-up to rule out renovascular hypertension in such patients should be pursued. The sensitivity and specificity of this \"test\" are 0.20 and 0.998, respectively. This illustrates that the mathematic aids in decision theory need not be applied solely to those more traditional aspects of diagnostic testing, but may be useful in other situations as well.", 
    "185": "Proteolytic hydrolysis rates of neurotensin and acetyl-neurotensin-(8-13) by brush-border membranes from various rat intestinal segments were as follows: jejunum > duodenum approximately jejunoileal junction > ileum > caecum. The rank order of endopeptidase-24.11 activity along the intestine was jejunum > duodenum approximately jejunoileal junction > ileum > caecum. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) had a similar distribution profile as endopeptidase-24.11. Activities of these two enzymes were lower in the distal intestine. Distribution of endopeptidase-2 activity along the intestine was different: ileum > duodenum approximately jejunum approximately jejunoileal junction > caecum. The profiles of differential hydrolysis of neurotensin and acetylneurotensin-(8-13) within the gut corresponded to the distribution of endopeptidase-24.11 and ACE. Moreover, effects of enzyme inhibitors confirm that these two enzymes initiated proteolysis of neurotensin and acetylneurotensin-(8-13). These results suggest that the regional differences in the activities of key brush-border membrane peptidases will affect site-dependent stability of peptide drugs.", 
    "186": "The effect of enalapril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, on glucose tolerance and serum insulin response to a glucose load has been evaluated in 8 non-obese patients (3 women and 5 men) with untreated essential hypertension (WHO Stage I or II) and without insulin resistance. Following a 2-month run-in control period, each patient received oral enalapril 10 mg once daily for 6 months, and an intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) was performed at the end of the run-in control and active treatment periods. Treatment with enalapril significantly lowered both the systolic and diastolic blood pressures. The response of plasma glucose to the IVGTT, glucose disappearance rate (k-value) and area under the serum insulin concentration time curve were comparable between the two phases. The results suggest that long-term treatment with enalapril has no effect on glucose tolerance in non-obese, non-insulin-resistant patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension.",

Patients in TG (80 patients) were treated with magnesium sulfate and captopril, while those in CG (70 patients) with digoxin. The results showed a marked difference (P < 0.01) in the total effective ratio between TG (92.5 percent) and CG (65.7 percent). Both groups had an increase in cardiac output and cardiac index, but it was more apparent in TG. With sum vessel resistance (SVR), TG had a remarkable decrease (P < 0.01), patients in while those in CG did not (P > 0.05). The results also showed that the therapeutic effect in TG was satisfactory. The important function of magnesium, the basis of its treatment and the simultaneous administration of magnesium and captopril to reduce the cardiac preload and afterload and to improve the heart function were discussed.", 
    "188": "As the prevalence of congestive heart failure is steadily increasing correct treatment becomes more and more important. In pathophysiology, clinical signs once believed to express the effort of the body to \"compensate\" for the failure (hypervolaemia, tachycardia, sympathetic stimulation) have been recognized as sort of a physiological error: to a primary signal which still remains not fully understood, the body responds in a similar way as to dehydration. As late as the mid-sixties, \"function curves\" represented a framework for our conceptual thinking and digitalis the essential treatment. Since then, we had to realize that the function of the failing ventricle is not determined just by filling and contractility-the way it is in the healthy ventricle is-but also by aortic impedance. Vasodilators have become the cornerstone of therapy. At present, diuretics are the most important drugs for congestive heart failure treatment. Thiazides, given together with loop diuretics, ameliorate extracellular fluid volume in all treated patients, but their effect is accompanied by potassium losses due to increased aldosterone levels. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are unique in not only decreasing ventricular afterload and improving haemodynamics but, also, in decreasing circulating norepinephrine levels, protecting kidneys from inappropriate efferent arteriolo-constriction and suppression of aldosterone secretion. In other words, ACE inhibitors change the essential physiological set-up: they turn a high-perfusion-pressure body into a low-perfusion-pressure one. Furthermore, they convincingly improve life expectancy. Combination of diuretics and ACE inhibitors is the best we can do for our patients today. Although useful in some patients, the definite value of digitalis, and particularly its effect on longevity, remains an unresolved question.", 
    "189": "The effect of prolonged treatment with calcium channel blockers on potassium and magnesium stores is uncertain. We measured lymphocyte and serum magnesium and potassium in 28 patients treated for hypertension for 6 months with nifedipine or captopril. There was no difference in serum or lymphocyte concentrations in the two groups compared to 45 healthy, normotensive controls. These results suggest that intracellular cation levels are maintained with prolonged therapy with calcium channel blockers.", 
    "190": "The study describes the changes in basic hemodynamic parameters after long-term antihypertensive therapy with cilazapril--a new ACE inhibitor lacking a sulfhydryl group--in hypertensive patients and the drug effects on renal function, glucose tolerance and lipid metabolism. 30 patients (18 males, 12 females, mean age: 53.3 +/- 18 years) with mild to moderate essential hypertension were studied. The following determinations were performed in patients, before and after 4.5 months of cilazapril monotherapy at a dose of 5 mg/24 h: (a) antihypertensive action of the drug (arterial pressure at rest and during a 24-hour recording); drug effects on left ventricular (LV) mass index; its contractility indexes (%FS, EF) and the left atrial emptying index were studied by means of echocardiography; (b) plasma insulin concentration during oral glucose tolerance tests, in the fasting state, after the administration of 75 g glucose per os, as well as the changes in the insulinogenic index and the 6-keto-PGF1 alpha/TXB2 ratio, and (c) drug effect on renal function (urea, creatinine, uric acid, plasma electrolytes), blood lipid profile (total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-CH) and serum transaminases. Long-term drug administration exhibits an effective antihypertensive action, without causing reflex tachycardia and also reduces the LV mass index without affecting its EF, while improving its diastolic function. It does not significantly affect the various biochemical parameters, and achieves glucose regulation, both in the fasting state and after glucose loading, with a decrease in the insulinogenic index, and simultaneously increases the 6-keto-PGF1 alpha/TXB2 ratio. The existence of a direct cause-effect relationship between the changes in the above hormone systems is possible.", 
    "191": "The powerful local metabolic regulation adjusting coronary blood flow to myocardial oxygen consumption under normal conditions is beyond doubt. However, despite substantial experimental efforts the responsible mediators are still largely unknown. Adenosine, a purported mediator of local metabolic control of coronary blood flow, is probably only involved in transient flow adaptations, but not in steady-state coronary autoregulation. Even below the autoregulatory range a substantial vasodilator reserve persists. Recruitment of such vasodilator reserve results in improved regional myocardial blood flow and attenuated regional ischemic dysfunction. beta-adrenergic coronary dilation is of minor functional importance. alpha-adrenergic coronary constriction acts to attenuate increases in coronary blood flow during sympathetic activation under normal conditions, such that myocardial oxygen extraction increases to match the increased oxygen consumption. alpha-adrenergic coronary constriction remains operative in ischemic myocardium, thus precipitating or contributing to acute myocardial ischemia during sympathetic activation and exercise in experimental animals as well as in patients with stable angina. The vagal transmitter acetylcholine--upon exogenous intracoronary infusion--induces critical constriction of epicardial coronary arteries with endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis. However, a vagal initiation of coronary spasm or myocardial ischemia has not been documented so far. Similarly, peptide hormones/transmitters such as NPY, vasopressin, and angiotensin can induce myocardial ischemia upon exogenous administration. Their pathophysiological role in myocardial ischemia and reperfusion, however, remains to be established.", 
    "192": "In this report we review the replacement (i.e., scarring) and reactive (i.e., perivascular and interstitial fibrosis) fibrous tissue responses found in the myocardium in response to effector hormones of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Experimental data are presented to indicate: a) endogenous or exogenous elevations in plasma angiotensin II are associated with acute cardiac myocyte necrosis and subsequent microscopic scarring; b) chronic elevations in plasma aldosterone (ALDO), relative to Na+ intake, are associated with a perivascular and interstitial fibrosis of the coronary and systemic circulations and are also seen in response to chronic administration of the mineralocorticoid hormone deoxycorticosterone (DOC); and c) chronic mineralocorticoid excess, due to ALDO or DOC, is associated with enhanced urinary K+ excretion, cardiac myocyte necrosis and scarring. Pharmacologic agents which interfere with these effector hormones (e.g., ACE inhibition and ALDO receptor antagonism) protect the myocardium against this pathologic structural remodeling created by the reactive and replacement (reparative) fibrosis. Evidence is also presented to indicate that chronic ACE inhibition is associated with a regression in reactive myocardial fibrosis. Based on these experimental findings we would suggest that clinical trials are indicated to address the prevention and regression of myocardial fibrosis--an important determinant of pathologic structural remodeling and abnormal myocardial stiffness.", 
    "193": "While the circulating renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays an important role in short-term maintenance of cardiovascular homeostasis, recent studies point to a role in long-term cardiovascular regulation for endogenous RAS in target tissues. This article focuses on the multiple effects of tissue angiotensin enzyme (ACE) and angiotensin II (Ang II), its active peptide product. Ang II has been shown to be a potent growth factor in vascular smooth muscle cells. Depending on the local conditions, the vascular response may be either hypertrophy or hyperplasia. The molecular mechanisms involved in the interactions of Ang II with endothelium- and smooth muscle-derived cell products may play important roles in the modulation of vascular structure in hypertension and vascular injury. Evidence also points to a role for Ang II in the development of left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertension. In addition, cardiac RAS may contribute to the pathophysiology of heart failure. Experimental and clinical studies with ACE inhibitors point to a role for tissue ACE activity in the development of atherosclerosis, as well as cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling.", 
    "194": "Recent studies have suggested that the progression of experimental chronic renal disease may be prevented by early use of antihypertensive drugs. It is unclear, however, whether such therapies may also affect established and progressive renal disease. In the present study we compared the effects of captopril (CEI) and diltiazem (CCB), started either at week 10 or at week 24 on the evolution of adriamycin nephropathy (AN). Rats were studied at weeks 7, 16, 24, 32, and 38 of the disease. None of the treatments influenced the development of nephrotic range proteinuria. The use of CCB from week 10 was even associated with increased proteinuria. The moderate hypertension of ADR rats was reduced to the same degree with both drugs. Inulin clearance (GFR) was significantly reduced in all ADR rats. However, in ADR rats treated with CEI from week 10 and in those treated with CCB from week 24, the GFR was relatively higher. Glomerular injury, evaluated by semiquantitative methods, was not ameliorated by CEI treatment. Earlier CCB treatment (week 10) worsened glomerular lesions, whilst CCB treatment initiated at week 24 reduced significantly the degree of mesangial expansion and focal glomerular sclerosis. We conclude that, in addition to their common antihypertensive action, the specific effect of drug therapy seems to be crucially time dependent.", 
    "195": "The effect of treatment of rats with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril after 5 weeks of untreated streptozotocin-diabetes was examined by daily monitoring of sciatic motor conduction velocity to tibialis anterior muscle. Diabetes produced a 31.5% decrease in conduction velocity (P < 0.001). Lisinopril treatment caused a progressive improvement which was significant after 3 days (P = 0.002), full normalization being achieved by 6 days (P < 0.0001). After 7 days of treatment there followed a 7-day washout period in which no lisinopril was given. During this time conduction velocity declined to untreated diabetic levels over 3 days. A subsequent treatment period resulted in complete normalization of conduction velocity within 2 days (P < 0.0001). Thus, the marked functional effects seen for vasodilator treatment with lisinopril suggest that angiotension converting enzyme inhibitors may have potential therapeutic value in the treatment of diabetic neuropathy.", 
    "196": "Captopril enhanced exocytotic enzyme secretion from rabbit peritoneal neutrophils activated by suboptimal concentrations of fMet-Leu-Phe. For optimal enhancement the presence of Ca2+ was required. Captopril did not induce enzyme secretion by its own, and there was little effect on PMA-induced exocytosis. Cyclic GMP level of neutrophils was transiently enhanced by captopril. Methylene blue inhibited both captopril-induced enhancement of enzyme release and of cGMP levels. From our studies and from reports in the literature it appears that cGMP level-enhancing compounds may have both activating or inhibitory properties.", 
    "197": "The antihypertensive efficacy and safety of lisinopril (L), a novel ACE inhibitor, were compared to those of captopril (C), the familiar drug of the same class, in a multicentre controlled trial. The study included 91 mild-to-moderate, middle-aged hypertensives of both genders, 46 of which were randomized to C and 45 to L. After a two-week placebo period the examinees were receiving either L o.d. in increasing dosage of 10, 20, or 40 mg per day (amount necessary to achieve normotension), or C b.i.d. in a corresponding daily dose of 25, 50, or 100 mg. During the eight-week formal part of the trial, L decreased the systolic blood pressure from the initial values by an average of 14.9%, and the diastolic pressure by some 15.2%. The same parameters were lowered on C by 11.2%, and 11.7%, respectively. The mean arterial pressure from an initial average of 125.5 mmHg was lowered to 110.9 mmHg on C (11.6% reduction, p < 0.01), and from 125.3 mmHg to 108.2 mmHg on L (13.6% reduction, p < 0.01). Although the L effects were more pronounced, the observed between-group differences did not reach the level of statistical significance, except for the achievement of normotension, which disclosed the superiority of L (p < 0.05). The tolerability of both drugs was good and only one examinee had to be excluded because of side-effects (proteinuria). It is concluded that both ACEIs under study showed comparable efficacy and safety, L being marginally more potent and longer acting.", 
    "198": "Hyperinsulinaemia and insulin resistance are associated with essential hypertension irrespective of obesity and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. One of the mechanisms whereby hyperinsulinaemia may play a role in the increase in blood pressure, is an increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system. The authors studied the incidence of hyperinsulinaemia, and the possibility of modulating it by 12-week administration of the ACE inhibitor (ACEI) lisinopril (Prinivil by MSD) at a dose of 20-40 mg/day. Compared with normotensive subjects, hypertensives showed a degree of hyperinsulinaemia and insulin resistance (higher blood glucose at higher immunoreactive insulin and C-peptide concentrations, and a higher IRI/blood glucose ratio) as well as manifestations of enhanced sympathetic activity (higher adrenaline levels). Lisinopril had a favourable effect not only on blood pressure but, also, on hyperinsulinaemia and adrenaline levels. It can be reasonably concluded that therapy with ACEI, in addition to its antihypertensive effect, may also favourably modulate some pathogenic and metabolic factors in essential hypertension.", 
    "199": "The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the ACE inhibitor quinaprilat have been studied in six chronic haemodialysis (HD) patients and in six patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) after a single oral dose of 2.5 mg quinapril. Mean tmax and Cmax values (SEM) for quinaprilat in interdialytic HD patients were 4.0 (0) h and 84 (8.4) ng.ml-1 respectively, and they did not differ significantly from those in CAPD patients (4.7 (0.7) h and 64 (5.7) ng.ml-1). Elimination half lives were 30 (10.1) h (HD) and 34 (7.3) h (CAPD). Cmax, tmax, t1/2, and AUC were increased and CL was decreased compared to data reported previously after giving 2.5 mg to healthy subjects. Peritoneal clearance was calculated as 0.1 (0.1) ml.min-1, thus less than 0.5% of the dose were removed within 24 h by CAPD. ACE activity was suppressed by more than 93% between 4 and 24 h postdose (P < 0.001). It decreased in both groups with increasing plasma quinaprilat levels. Angiotensin II concentration compared to baseline was significantly decreased at 4 hours (-30.4 +/- 10%) and 24 h (-30 +/- 9.9%) (P < 0.05, n = 11), while active plasma renin concentration was still significantly increased at 48 h postdose (+ 60.2 +/- 14.5%, P < 0.01). Mean arterial pressure 24 h postdose was significantly (P < 0.05) decreased in HD (-12 mmHg) and CAPD patients (-20 mm Hg). Only two patients reported unwanted effects (fatigue, dizziness, nausea, and weakness). In conclusion, due to its long lasting effect on ACE activity and on blood pressure in terminal renal failure a starting dose of quinapril 2.5 mg o.d. may be used in hypertensive HD and CAPD patients.", 
    "200": "1. The effect of H2O2 (4.7 x 10(-9) -4.7 x 10(-3) M) on prostanoid production by isolated glomeruli from normotensive (WKY) and, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) has been studied. 2. Oxidant stress significantly increased synthesis of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), I2 (PGI2) and thromboxane A2 (TxA2) by glomeruli from both strains whereas the ratio (PGE2 + PGI2)/TxA2 increased in only SHR. 3. Pre-incubation of glomeruli with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors captopril or lisinopril, had virtually no effect on H2O2-induced synthesis of individual prostanoids nor on the ratio (PGE2 + PGI2)/TxA2 by glomeruli from either WKY or SHR. 4. The findings suggest that H2O2-induced changes in glomerular function may be mediated, in part, by PGs but fail to support the suggestion that the ability of ACEI to protect glomeruli from H2O2-induced damage is determined by PGs.", 
    "201": "Although lisinopril and enalapril are equipotent angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors lisinopril has been reported to produce greater inhibition of plasma ACE 24 hours after single doses. This study compared the antihypertensive effects of once daily 10mg doses of the drugs using a randomised, double-blind, two period cross-over design with ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Lisinopril lowered mean 24 hour systolic blood pressure significantly more than enalapril after 4 weeks of treatment (14/7 +/- 2/1mmHg & 9/6 +/- 2/1mmHg, respectively, adjusted SBP difference 4.8mmHg, P < 0.01). This difference was confined to the second 12 hours of the daily dosage interval (adjusted SBP difference 13-24 hours after dosing 9.9mmHg, P < 0.001). The diastolic pressure showed a similar trend but this was not statistically significant. The side effects of each agent were minor. We conclude that chronic, once daily therapy with 10mg of lisinopril reduces systolic blood pressure more effectively than an equal dose of enalapril due to its greater effect in the latter half of the 24 hour dosage interval.", 
    "202": "The effects of nifedipine retard and captopril on renal haemodynamic parameters have been examined in a double blind randomised cross-over trial in 10 insulin-dependent diabetic males with hypertension (systolic pressure > 150 mmHg or diastolic pressure > 90 mmHg). The acute renal haemodynamic response to nifedipine retard 20 mg and captopril 25 mg was monitored at the start of therapy and again after 8 weeks treatment with nifedipine retard 20 mg b.d. and captopril 25 mg b.d. Blood pressure fell from 148/97 +/- 4/2 (SEM) during the run-in phase to 135/87 +/- 4/1.5 on nifedipine retard and to 131/83 +/- 5/1 on captopril. There was no difference between the initial renal response to the two agents; an increase in renal plasma flow and a non-significant decline in glomerular filtration rate resulted in similar decreases in filtration fraction. After 8 weeks therapy, neither drug had a significant effect on urinary albumin excretion. Baseline renal function did not differ and no acute changes in renal haemodynamics were seen after nifedipine. Following captopril there was no acute change in systemic blood pressure but RPF rose from 572 +/- 41 to 638 +/- 42 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (P < 0.05) and filtration fraction fell from 0.21 to 0.16 (P < 0.02). This sustained acute response of the renal circulation to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition after chronic therapy may be relevant to the apparent renal protection afforded by ACE inhibitors in experimental nephropathies.", 
    "203": "The acute haemodynamic effects of several equivalent dosages of lisinopril and captopril were compared in patients with severe class III or IV congestive heart failure. The evaluation was started with a low dose of 2.5 mg lisinopril o.d. or 6.25 mg captopril t.i.d. and subsequent daily increases to 5 and 10 mg lisinopril o.d. or 12.5 and 25 mg captopril t.i.d. Captopril had an earlier onset of action compared to lisinopril and caused larger diurnal fluctuations of the haemodynamic parameters. Lisinopril provoked a more pronounced decrease in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) than captopril and only lisinopril increased the cardiac index significantly. Side-effects of hypotension or increase in serum creatinine leading to withdrawal according to protocol were noted in 3 patients on each drug. Increases in dosage caused very little increase in haemodynamic effect, suggesting that complete suppression of the angiotensin-converting enzyme may not be necessary for an optimal clinical response.", 
    "204": "Study is to test the hypothesis that antihypertensive treatment based on ambulatory monitoring may be more beneficial than treatment guided by conventional sphygmomanometry. After a 2 month run-in period on placebo, eligible hypertensive patients (sitting diastolic pressure > 95 mm Hg on conventional measurement) will be randomized into 2 groups, one in which the target pressure is a sitting diastolic pressure from 80 through 89 mm Hg on conventional sphygmomanometry, and one in which a daytime (from 10 to 20 h) ambulatory diastolic pressure from 80 through 89 mm Hg should be achieved. For 6 months following randomization, treatment consisting of lisinopril 10-20 mg per day, associated with 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide and 5 mg amlodipine, as necessary, will be stepwise adjusted in order to reach the goal pressure. During this period of the trial the doctor making the therapeutic decisions at the Coordinating Office will be kept blinded with respect to the type of measurement guiding therapy. A final period of 4 months, during which treatment will be adjusted by the patient's personal physician according to the current recommendations, concludes the trial. The outcome measures include the blood pressure level on conventional and ambulatory measurement, the amount of drugs required to achieve the goal blood pressure, side-effects evaluated by a self-administered questionnaire and left ventricular mass as assessed by electrocardiography and echocardiography.",

Twenty-two patients with renovascular hypertension and significant lateralization of renin secretion were investigated with respect to arterial and renal venous plasma noradrenaline and dopamine concentrations before and 30 min after two different blood pressure-lowering procedures (enalaprilat or dihydralazine intravenously). 2. In one group of patients (n = 10) blood pressure reduction by 7.5 mg of dihydralazine caused stimulation of the renin-angiotensin system and increased heart rate (P < 0.01) as well as arterial and renal venous plasma noradrenaline and dopamine concentrations (P < 0.01 for both). The elevation of the plasma dopamine concentration was more pronounced than that of noradrenaline, yielding increased dopamine/noradrenaline ratios both peripherally (P < 0.05) and in the renal veins (P < 0.05). 3. In the second group of patients (n = 12) a comparable reduction in blood pressure elicited by 1.25 mg of enalaprilat was not accompanied by alterations in heart rate or in noradrenaline or dopamine levels in arterial plasma or renal venous plasma from either kidney. 4. Thus, inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme does not elicit the expected sympathetic counter-regulatory response to blood pressure reduction; the mechanism(s) involved remains to be clarified.", 
    "218": "To examine the potential role for intrarenal angiotensin II in mediating the antinatriuretic action of insulin, seven normal males were studied on three occasions, twice during euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemia (40 mU.m-2.min-1) after double-blind treatment for 1 week with placebo and the converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril, and on a time control day. Lithium carbonate 250 mg was given before each study as an indirect marker of tubular sodium handling. Renal haemodynamics did not change during hyperinsulinaemia. Insulin infusion reduced both the absolute and fractional urinary excretion rates of sodium (P < 0.001) and potassium (P < 0.001); these effects of insulin were not altered after converting enzyme inhibition. Lithium clearance did not change during insulin infusion on either day. The antinatriuretic effect of hyperinsulinaemia is mediated at a tubular site distal to the proximal tubule. The data does not support the hypothesis that intrarenal generation of angiotensin II plays a part in this action of insulin.", 
    "219": "1. To investigate the role of transcriptional and post-transcriptional factors in increasing renin synthesis secondary to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, we studied the changes in levels of renal renin mRNA, plasma renin and other hormonal factors. 2. Spontaneously hypertensive rats were orally administered 10 mg/kg spirapril or vehicle daily for 3, 14 or 28 days. 3. Plasma renin activity in the spirapril-treated group was significantly elevated compared with that in the vehicle group at any time (P < 0.01). However, there was no significant change in plasma angiotensin II concentration between the two groups. The ratio of renal renin mRNA to beta-actin mRNA in the spirapril-treated group was higher than that in the control group (P < 0.01). 4. At 28 days, plasma renin activity in the spirapril-treated group was significantly elevated compared with that at 14 days (P < 0.05). However, there was no change in renin mRNA between 14 and 28 days after ACE inhibitor administration. 5. Plasma ACE activity in the treatment group was less than that in the control group at any time (P < 0.01). 6. Our study demonstrated a non-proportional change in plasma renin and renal renin mRNA levels. It is suggested that the main determinant of the rate of renin synthesis after administration of an ACE inhibitor may be post-transcriptional factors, and that unknown mechanisms may be involved in the increase in plasma renin level after long-term administration of ACE inhibitor in addition to the short feedback mechanism brought about by the decrease in angiotensin II.", 
    "220": "An earlier study has shown that angiotensin and catecholamines were responsible for the vasoconstriction observed in the isolated hindlimb preparation during aortic cross-clamping. That study also demonstrated that when vasoconstriction was blocked with an alpha-adrenergic antagonist, phenoxybenzamine, vasodilation was elicited by aortic cross-clamping. The present study tested the hypothesis that this vasodilation was mediated via beta-adrenergic receptors. Eighteen dogs had their hindlimb denervated, vascularly isolated, and pump perfused with blood drained from the inferior vena cava, after passing through a gas-exchanging membrane where oxygen and carbon dioxide tensions were normalized. Left and right thoracotomies were performed, and the aorta and inferior vena cava were cross-clamped. The cross-clamping was associated with 29-37% increase in limb vascular resistance in control dogs (n = 6), in animals pretreated with propranolol (2 mg/kg, n = 6), and in dogs pretreated with a combination of phenoxybenzamine (3 mg/kg) and propranolol (2 mg/kg, n = 6). In animals pretreated with a combination of phenoxybenzamine, propranolol, and enalaprilat (2 mg/kg, n = 6), an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, limb vascular resistance did not change. This study has confirmed that aortic cross-clamping is associated with vasoconstriction induced by angiotensin and activation of alpha-adrenoceptors and has further demonstrated that vasodilation is attributable to beta-adrenoceptor activation.", 
    "221": "We investigated whether captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor with a sulfhydryl group, enalaprilat, an ACE inhibitor without a sulfhydryl group, and cysteine, an amino acid with a sulfhydryl group but no ACE-inhibiting properties, could scavenge hydrogen peroxide and prevent oxidant-induced cell injury. When 0.1-2.5 mM concentrations of captopril, cysteine, or enalaprilat were incubated with xanthine oxidase and hypoxanthine for 0-120 min, the recovery of hydrogen peroxide was significantly (P < 0.001) reduced in the presence of captopril or cysteine, whereas enalaprilat had no effect on the recovery of hydrogen peroxide. Captopril and cysteine could not scavenge hydrogen peroxide when the sulfhydryl group was blocked with N-ethylmaleimide. When human renal tubular epithelial cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells were exposed to hydrogen peroxide, oxidant-induced depletion of ATP and efflux of [3H]adenine metabolites was mildly reduced in the presence of captopril or cysteine but was not altered by enalaprilat. Cysteine was more effective in preventing oxidant-induced cell injury than captopril. We conclude that because of its sulfhydryl group, captopril at millimolar concentrations can scavenge hydrogen peroxide and can slightly reduce, but does not eliminate, oxidant-induced cell injury.", 
    "222": "The kinetic properties of Na+/H+ exchange are significantly different in segments of mesenteric arteries from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) as compared to normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. Both the maximal rate of Na+/H+ exchange and the sensitivity of Na+/H+ exchange to intracellular [H+] are greater in vessels from hypertensive animals. Prehypertensive SHR do not exhibit these features, thus the present studies examined the role of blood pressure in mediating the response. Both SHR and WKY rats were treated with captopril for 4 weeks, after which the characteristics of the Na+/H+ exchanger were examined. The Na+/H+ exchange was monitored in tissue segments by measuring Nao-dependent, dimethyl amiloride-sensitive recovery of intracellular pH after acid loading (pHi determined using the pH-sensitive fluorescent dye 2',7'-bis(carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxyfluorescein). In SHR, captopril reduced mean arterial pressure from 153 to 118 mm Hg and altered Na+/H+ exchange. Maximal transport rate decreased from 0.164 to 0.056 mmol/L H+/sec and the sensitivity of the Na+/H+ exchange to internal H+ decreased (ie, the Hill coefficient decreased from 6.6 to 2.2). In WKY rats captopril reduced blood pressure from 108 to 71 mm Hg, but had no effect on the Na+/H+ exchange. Since reduced pressure affected Na+/H+ exchange in SHR, but not in WKY, it is likely that the Na+/H+ exchanger, or the cellular processes regulating its properties, differ in the two rat strains. Supporting this notion was the finding that ouabain treatment reduced the Hill coefficient of SHR vessels but had no effect in WKY vessels.", 
    "223": "Few drug reactions are more life threatening than the sudden development of edema involving the mucosal and submucosal layers of the upper aerodigestive tract. Drug-induced angioedema is a recognized entity of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and despite reports in medical journals and drug insert warnings, captopril and enalapril continue to be widely prescribed. As these drugs are efficacious and usually well-tolerated in the treatment of mild forms of hypertension, their popularity is rising. From June 1, 1984 to August 1, 1991, 36 patients with angioedema secondary to ACE inhibitors presented at the Medical College of Virginia Hospitals. Thirty were successfully managed with medical therapy. Two were intubated, 1 had placement of a nasal trumpet, and 3 required tracheostomies. Of extreme importance is the recognition that angioedema resulting from ACE inhibitors is probably not immunoglobulin E (IgE) mediated and that antihistaminics and steroids may not alleviate the airway obstruction. The otolaryngologist must be prepared for the need of possible early surgical intervention.",

    "225": "Recent studies suggest that the therapeutic effects of converting enzyme inhibitors involve not only the renin-angiotensin and prostaglandin systems but also the sympathetic system.", 
    "226": "Twelve hypertensive and 20 normotensive men were studied after 2 5-day hospital stays during which they consumed a 10-mEq sodium diet and received captopril (25 mg twice daily) or placebo in a double-blind crossover study.", 
    "227": "Captopril decreased neuropeptide Y (p < 0.05) and angiotensin II (p < 0.01) and increased isoproterenol-stimulated cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) in lymphocytes (p < 0.03), plasma norepinephrine (p < 0.02), cortisol (p < 0.05) and renin (p < 0.001) in both hypertensive and normotensive subjects. Hypertensive subjects had an increased beta-adrenergic receptor density (p < 0.02) and a greater decrease in diastolic blood pressure compared with normotensive subjects (p < 0.02).", 
    "228": "The results of this study suggest that the short-term therapeutic effects of captopril may involve concerted changes in key components of the sympathetic nervous system. These findings, such as decreased neuropeptide Y combined with increased norepinephrine and beta-adrenergic receptors, are compatible with the observation of increased cardiac output and decreased peripheral resistance after short-term angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition.", 
    "229": "A test with capoten, inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme, was employed to assess intrarenal hemodynamics (renal functional reserve-RFR) in 17 patients with morphologically confirmed chronic glomerulonephritis (CGN) in intact renal function without hypertension. Capoten induced three types of changes: RFR increased (9 cases, 7 patients recovered RFR), RFR without changes (5 cases), RFR decreased (3 cases, 2 patients lost RFR). It is stated that indications to inhibitors of angiotensin-II-converting enzyme in CGN should be based on the initial intrarenal hemodynamics and its changes in response to acute capoten test. Capoten is to be administered in initially reduced or absent RFR and is not to the used in normal RFR without hypertension and functioning kidneys. RFR recovery in the acute capoten test allows long-term treatment with inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme.", 
    "230": "The effect of synthetic alpha-human atrial natriuretic peptide (alpha-hANP) on plasma endothelin-1 (ET-1) level was examined in 6 healthy subjects. Intravenous infusion of alpha-ANP (0.1 micrograms/kg/min) resulted in significant falls in plasma renin activity and aldosterone, but without effect on ET-1 level. An angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, increased plasma renin activity and decreased aldosterone, respectively. However, plasma ET-1 levels were not modified by captopril. In cases with alpha-hANP infusion after captopril (25 mg, p.o.,), the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system was further inhibited compared with the first group, and ET-1 at 60 min was significantly suppressed from the baseline. These data suggest that alpha-hANP when combined with captopril brings about the suppression of plasma ET-1 concentrations in men.", 
    "231": "Disturbances of the fibrinolytic system have been associated with cardiovascular disease and its risk factors. In the present study the effects of an ACE-inhibitor (enalapril) and a placebo on the fibrinolytic system have been compared. Eighty one survivors of acute myocardial infarction were randomised to treatment with enalapril or placebo. The mass concentrations and activity of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) in plasma were measured three months after the infarction. The enalapril group had a significantly lower level of tPA antigen compared to the placebo-treated group (9.2 and 10.6 respectively). There was no difference between the two groups in any of the other fibrinolytic variables. We conclude that survivors of myocardial infarction treated with enalapril have a significantly lower concentration of tPA antigen than those treated with placebo. This may have a prognostic implication, as lower plasma concentrations of tPA antigen have been associated with better prognosis in patients with established coronary heart disease.", 
    "232": "We have investigated whether the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the ACE inhibitor benazepril hydrochloride are altered with proteinuria by studying 8 patients with major proteinuria of different causes who were given a single dose of 10 mg p.o. The maximum plasma concentration of benazepril was found between 0.5 and 2 h after dosing (median 1 h). Its elimination was almost complete within 6 h. Peak plasma levels of benazeprilat, the active metabolite of benazepril, were observed between 1 and 6 h (median 2.5 h). The elimination of benazeprilat from plasma was biphasic, with mean initial and terminal half-lives of 3.0 and 17.3 h, respectively. On average, the pharmacokinetic parameters of benazepril and benazeprilat in the patients did not differ from those in a historical control group of healthy volunteers, but intersubject variability in the AUC and half-lives of benazeprilat was greater in the patients. Plasma ACE was completely inhibited from 1.5 to 6 h after dosing, and at 48 h the mean inhibition was still 42%. Plasma renin showed substantial intersubject variation. Mean supine blood pressure (systolic/diastolic) was reduced from baseline by a maximum of 18/13 mm Hg at 6 h. Proteinuria was diminished after benazepril in 7 patients. In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that proteinuria in the nephrotic range does not require a change in benazepril dosage.", 
    "233": "Arterial hypertension is the most frequent cause of a disturbance of coronary microcirculation. Inspite of having normal epicardial coronary arteries, patients with arterial hypertension often have symptoms of angina pectoris and a positive exercise tolerance test. The angina pectoris-symptoms in patients with arterial hypertension are due to functional and structural alterations of the coronary microcirculation. Consequently, an antihypertensive therapy should not only aim at lowering blood pressure and reversing myocardial hypertrophy, but also improve coronary microcirculation in order to avoid the consequences of chronic ischemia on the myocardium. Until now, only experimental studies have indicated that antihypertensive therapy can improve coronary flow reserve. To determine to what extent under clinical conditions coronary flow reserve can be improved, in hypertensive patients maximal coronary blood flow, minimal coronary resistance, and coronary reserve (Dipyridamol) were studied before and after a long-term antihypertensive treatment (9-12 months) with the ACE-inhibitor enalapril (10-20 mg/d). To assess the chronic effects rather than the acute effects of the antihypertensive pharmacon, the coronary microcirculation was studied after intermission of medical therapy for a period of 1 week. Along with a decrease in LV muscle mass by about 8%, coronary reserve was improved after enalapril by 48%. It is likely that the observed increase in coronary reserve is related to the reversal of structural vascular abnormalities at the level of the coronary microcirculation. Consequently, it seems that reparation of hypertensive remodeling of the coronary microcirculation can be induced by ACE-inhibitor therapy.", 
    "234": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors are established in the treatment of arterial hypertension and heart failure. In recent years ACE-inhibitors have also been used in the treatment of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), since from experimental data an antiischemic action of these agents is suggested. Antiischemic effects of ACE-inhibitors may be exerted through a reduction of myocardial oxygen demand, by a reduction of angiotensin-mediated coronary vasoconstriction, by an interaction with bradykinin and the prostaglandin system, by a modulation of endothelial control of vascular tone, and by an interaction with the sympathetic nervous system. However, clinical findings on potential beneficial effects of ACE-inhibitors in patients with CAD are inconsistent and controversial. While in hypertensive patients with CAD ACE-inhibitors generally seem to attenuate myocardial ischemia at rest and during exercise, a significant fraction of about 30% of normotensive patients with CAD does not benefit or even deteriorates. Lowering of coronary perfusion pressure and alteration of transmural blood flow distribution may be responsible for this. In patients with left ventricular dysfunction (SOLVD) or congestive heart failure (CONSENSUS, SOLVD) ACE-inhibitors have been proven to prevent progressive deterioration in left ventricular function and to reduce mortality. In patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction (SAVE), long-term administration of captropril was associated with an improvement in survival and reduced morbidity and mortality due to major cardiovascular events. Therefore, from a prognostic viewpoint patients with CAD and left ventricular dysfunction or congestive heart failure should be treated with ACE-inhibitors, although the clinical use of ACE-inhibitors in patients with ongoing angina pectoris may be limited by an aggravation of angina, presumably due to critically lowering coronary perfusion pressure. Finally, ACE-inhibitors failed to prevent restenosis after successful PTCA. In conclusion, from a prognostic viewpoint patients with CAD and congestive heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction should be treated with ACE-inhibitors. In hypertensive patients ACE-inhibitors generally seem to attenuate myocardial ischemia. In normotensive patients with CAD and angina pectoris but without left ventricular dysfunction ACE-inhibitors cannot generally be recommended at present, unless the patients, which may have benefit from ACE-inhibitor treatment can be better defined.", 
    "235": "During the last decade, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) have become cornerstones in the treatment of clinical congestive heart failure. There is convincing evidence that they improve survival and that, in this respect, they are superior to ordinary vasodilators. ACE-I administration also improves New York Heart Association functional class and the left-ventricular function, but their long-term effects on exercise tolerance and quality of life appear modest. During prolonged administration to patients with ischemic left-ventricular dysfunction, ACE-I also significantly reduce the incidence of new ischemic events (myocardial infarction, unstable angina).", 
    "236": "For more than a decade, the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system in heart failure has been regarded as pure vasodilator therapy. Consequently, the role of the renin-angiotension system has been seen as contributing to hemodynamic overload by vasoconstriction and volume retention. Meanwhile, clinical experience was indicated that important additional aspects of ACE-inhibition in heart failure are attenuation of the enhanced neuroendocrine activity and reversal or prevention of inappropriate trophic reactions of the overloaded myocardium. In overloaded hearts there is enhanced intracardiac formation of angiotensin due to enhanced expression of angiotensinogen and ACE, and due to accumulation of circulating, nephrogenic active renin. In human hearts, a mast-cell-derived chymase, which is not blocked by ACE-inhibition, contributes to intracardiac angiotensin formation. The enhanced intracardiac angiotensin-II formation in overloaded hearts is involved in coronary constriction, impairment of diastolic relaxation, myocyte enlargement and interstitial fibrosis, which aggravate the diastolic impairment. The major problem in overloaded, hypertrophied cardiocytes is the dedifferentiation with instabilization of Ca(++)-homeostasis due to an altered program of gene expression. Dedifferentiated cardiocytes have a reduced expression of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(++)-ATPase and an enhanced expression of the sarcolemmal Na+/Ca(++)-exchanger, resulting in an attenuation of active diastole (Ca(++)-reaccumulation into the sarcoplasmic reticulum), a depressed force-frequency relation, and an enhanced susceptibility for fatal arrhythmias. Furthermore, an enhanced local renin-angiotensin system in distensible coronary and systemic arteries seems to contribute to a reduced releasability of endothelium-derived relaxing factor, probably by reducing bradykinin availability. This modulation of endothelial function appears to contribute to the localization and progression of atheroma development in presence of risks factors for atherosclerosis.", 
    "237": "There are multiple mechanisms whereby ACE inhibitors could be beneficial during myocardial ischemia and reperfusion, including: i) reduced formation of angiotensin II, ii) decreased metabolism of bradykinin, iii) antioxidant activity, and iv) possibly other unknown mechanisms. Reduced formation of angiotensin II should be beneficial because this peptide exerts several actions that are potentially detrimental to the ischemic/reperfused myocardium, including vasoconstriction, increased release of norepinephrine, stimulation of phospholipase C and/or A2, and increased afterload with an attendant increase in oxygen demands. Reduced metabolism of bradykinin could be beneficial by increasing myocardial glucose uptake, by causing vasodilation, and by stimulating production of endothelium-derived relaxing factor and prostacyclin. Although earlier studies suggested that sulfhydryl-containing ACE inhibitors scavenge superoxide anions, recent data have shown that these drugs scavenge hydroxyl radical and hypochlorous acid with no effect on superoxide anion. Studies in isolated hearts have demonstrated that ACE inhibitors attenuate the metabolic, arrhythmic, and contractile dearrangements associated with ischemia and reperfusion, and have suggested that such beneficial effects are mediated by potentiation of bradykinin and/or increased synthesis of prostacyclin. Studies in models of myocardial stunning after brief (15-min) ischemia in vivo (anesthetized dogs) suggest that ACE inhibitors enhance the recovery of contractile function after a single brief ischemic episode. No data are available regarding the effect of these drugs on myocardial stunning after a prolonged, partly reversible episode, after multiple consecutive brief ischemic episodes, and after global ischemia. The mechanism for the salutary effects of ACE inhibitors on stunning remains a mystery. It may involve an antioxidant action (in the case of thiol-containing molecules) or potentiation of prostaglandins (in the case of non-thiol-containing molecules). What is clear is that the enhanced recovery of function effected by these drugs is not due to hemodynamic effects, inhibition of the converting enzyme per se, or an \"antischemic\" action (since the drugs were effective when given at the time of reperfusion). The effects of ACE inhibitors on myocardial infarct size remain controversial. Further studies will be necessary to conclusively establish whether ACE inhibitors can protect against the detrimental effects of myocardial ischemia and reperfusion. Nevertheless, the evidence provided thus far is encouraging and warrants an in-depth assessment of the role of these drugs in attenuating myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury.", 
    "238": "The renin angiotensin system and endothelium-derived vasoactive substances are both important regulators of vascular tone. Recent evidence suggests that the two systems may be tightly interconnected and drugs interfering with one system may also affect the other. Beside the circulating renin angiotensin system, a vascular wall renin angiotensin system has been postulated and various components of it have been demonstrated in endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells. Of particular importance is the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) which is identical to kininase II, which breaks down bradykinin into inactive components. Bradykinin is a potent activator of the L-arginine nitric oxide system (endothelium-derived relaxing factor). Hence, ACE-inhibitors not only deactivate the pressor system, but increase the local concentrations of bradykinin and thereby stimulate a potent endothelium-derived vasodilator system. Angiotensin II not only can activate vascular smooth muscle cells (where it causes contraction and proliferation), but also endothelial cells. In certain blood vessels, angiotensin II can stimulate prostacyclin production; in addition, angiotensin II activates endothelin messenger RNA in endothelial cells. This activation of the endothelin vasopressor system increases vascular tone and enhances the local vasoconstrictor responses (due to the amplifying effects of endothelin on noradrenaline- and serotonin-induced contractions). Although the acute effects of ACE-inhibitors in isolated blood vessels are restricted to inhibition of angiotensin I-induced contractions and augmentation of bradykinin-induced endothelium-dependent relaxations, chronic therapy with the drugs appears to enhance endothelium-dependent responses to several agonists, particularly in hypertensive animals. Hence, this mechanism of action of ACE-inhibitors may account for an important vascular protective effect of the drugs. Thus, in summary, the renin angiotensin system and endothelium-derived vasoactive substances are tightly interconnected. This may be important under physiological and pathophysiological conditions, and is of importance for the action of currently available cardiovascular drugs, in particular, ACE-inhibitors.", 
    "239": "Coronary artery occlusion results in the acute activation of the renin-angiotensin system and production of angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor and positive inotropic agent. This has raised the possibility that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors might be \"cardioprotective\" (that is, might attenuate myocardial injury, dysfunction and necrosis) in the setting of acute ischemia and infarction. Captopril, enalapril and ramipril have, in fact, been reported to acutely limit myocardial injury and necrosis in models of permanent coronary artery occlusion. The mechanisms responsible for this cardioprotection are complex, but include favorable alterations in myocardial oxygen supply/demand, and, in some instances, inhibition of bradykinin metabolism and/or increased prostaglandin synthesis. Other studies, however, have failed to document a reduction in infarct size with ACE inhibitor treatment. Results obtained in models of coronary occlusion/reperfusion have also been mixed. In models of brief transient ischemia not associated with necrosis, captopril and zofenopril have consistently been found to attenuate postischemic contractile dysfunction of the viable but \"stunned\" myocardium during the early hours following relief of ischemia. In contrast, there is no consensus on the effects of enalapril on the stunned myocardium: both positive and negative results have been obtained. Similar disparity has been reported in models of more prolonged ischemia/reperfusion resulting in subendocardial necrosis: some studies have reported myocardial salvage, while others have provided disturbing evidence of apparent exacerbation of myocardial necrosis with captopril and enalapril therapy. Thus, after a decade of investigative effort, the question of whether ACE inhibitors are \"cardioprotective\" in the setting of acute myocardial ischemia and infarction remains unresolved. Nonetheless, clinical protocols are in progress to assess the effects of early ACE inhibitor treatment in patients with acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "240": "Changes of ischemic myocardium following coronary occlusion, including active and passive functions, and adaptive changes of non-ischemic surviving myocardium have been summarized under the term \"left ventricular remodeling\" post myocardial infarction. An increase in left ventricular volume may be a consequence, and associated with an adverse prognosis. Although left ventricular dilatation may increase stroke volume and, thus, be compensatory at first, in about one-fifth of patients it ultimately results in progressive dysfunction and heart failure. Major determinants of this process are time, infarct size, infarct location, global left ventricular function assessed 4 days after infarction by radionuclide ejection fraction and right heart catheter (stroke volume), and morphology of the infarct-associated coronary artery. The surviving myocardium hypertrophies and may also dilate structurally. Depression of left ventricular ejection fraction chronically after the infarct is due to deterioration of wall motion of chamber segments initially classified normal by radionuclide analysis. Biochemical changes may also occur, including reduction of phosphocreatine, prolongation of time to peak Cai2+, and changes in myosin isoforms. Systemic or local humoral factors may be involved in these changes, however, clear evidence is still lacking. Perfusion of surviving myocardium may be altered under various conditions due to morphologic and functional changes of coronary vasculature. Successful prevention of heart failure and death by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in asymptomatic patients with left ventricular dysfunction post-myocardial infarction has supported the pathophysiologic concepts of remodeling.", 
    "241": "Data presented herein will show that bradykinin, microbial proteases which activate the kinin generating cascade, and kininase inhibitors can enhance septicemia by approximately 10 to 100 fold in mice infected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with a strain of bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 621, which does not usually produce a kinin generating protease. Bacterial spreading was evaluated either in the blood or in the spleen by colony formation on agar plates. Using the P. aeruginosa kaguma strain which produces a large amount of proteases, further experiments were carried out. Results showed that two different protease inhibitors (ovomacroglobulin and a synthetic peptide inhibitor against pseudomonal elastase) as well as a kinin antagonist suppressed bacterial dissemination to 1/10-1/100 of control. Similar results were observed in experiments using Vibrio vulnificus. These data support the hypothesis that microbial proteases and especially bradykinin is responsible for facilitation of microbial dissemination in vivo.",

    "244": "We studied the effect of enalapril, an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme (iACE), on proteinuria and renal function in recipients of renal allografts. Twenty-two patients with post-transplant nephrotic syndrome were treated with incremental doses of enalapril for 1 year. Urinary protein excretion decreased after 2 months of treatment from a mean of 8.9 g/day (range 4.0-18.9 g/day) to 4.5 g/day (range 0.4-10.0 g/day; P < 0.01) and remained significantly low for the rest of the study. However, in the same period, creatinine clearance did not change significantly; it went from 47.8 ml/min (range 17.1-110.3 ml/min) before treatment to 44.2 ml/min (range 16.5-88.5 ml/min) after 2 months of iACE therapy. Analysis of individual data showed that there was a significant reduction in proteinuria in 14 of the 22 patients and that the rate of deterioration of renal function did not increase in 17 of the 22 patients. We did not observe any serious side effects of enalapril administration. The results of our study prove that iACE can be used safely and effectively to reduce post-transplant proteinuria.", 
    "245": "The aim of this study was to determine whether or not angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril, could ameliorate the chronic tubulo-interstitial nephropathy (TIN) in uninephrectomized (UNx) rats. Chronic TIN(M) was induced by 2-bromoethylamine hydrobromide. Rats were assigned to five groups; control, UNx-control (UNxC), UNx treated with enalapril (UNxE), UNxMC and UNxME. Enalapril was given for 12 months as drinking water (50 mg/l). At 6 months, albuminuria in UNxE decreased significantly compared with UNxC, but without change in UNxM rats. By 12 months, although all rats in control, UNxC and UNxE remained alive, 1 and 4 rats died in UNxME and UNxMC, respectively. Albuminuria in UNxC was reduced significantly by enalapril but not in UNxM rats. Both urine volume and urine osmolality became equal to control by enalapril in UNx rats, but not in UNxM rats. Serum cholesterol levels were normalized by enalapril in UNx rats, but not in UNxM rats. Levels of serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen were invariably higher in UNxM than in UNx rats, irrespective of enalapril. Glomerular sclerosis was statistically decreased by enalapril in both UNx and UNxM rats. Enalapril reduced the overall tubulo-interstitial lesions in UNx rats, but not in UNxM group. However, in UNxM rats tubular changes in medullary portion were significantly ameliorated by enalapril. These data suggest that enalapril has a beneficial effect on chronic TIN in this model.", 
    "246": "Compared to healthy humans in most patients with cirrhosis and renal sodium and water retention, effects of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) on sodium and water excretion are reduced. It has been postulated that this impaired response to ANP is caused by renal vasoconstriction, induced by high levels of angiotensin II. To further investigate this issue, we studied renal hemodynamics (glomerular filtration rate, GFR, single nephron GFR, SNGFR, renal blood flow, RBF) and urinary sodium excretion (UNaV) in rats with CCl4-induced cirrhosis of the liver, before and during ANP infusion. The same parameters were determined in cirrhotic rats after a 4-day pretreatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril before and during ANP. Results were compared to those obtained in 2 control groups of healthy rats, one of them pretreated with captopril. Rats with cirrhosis had a significantly reduced GFR, SNGFR, RBF, UNaV and an elevated plasma renin activity compared to healthy controls. ANP caused a significant rise in UNaV (+198%) but no significant change of GFR, SNGFR and RBF in cirrhotic rats. Captopril-pretreated rats with cirrhosis had a significantly higher RBF (+26%) and 24-hour urinary sodium excretion (+52%) but no significant differences in GFR and SNGFR compared to cirrhotic rats without captopril pretreatment. Administration of ANP to cirrhotic rats pretreated with captopril resulted in a significant rise in GFR (+56%), SNGFR (+42%), RBF (+29%) and UNaV (+159%) compared to cirrhotic rats with ANP alone. In healthy rats, there was no additional effect of a combined therapy with captopril and ANP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "247": "Radiation of the kidney often leads to renal failure. The contribution of arterial hypertension to the development of this complication is unclear. The aim of this study was to determine the renal effects of antihypertensive therapy in 1- and 2-kidney rat models of radiation nephritis. Five groups of Long Evans rats had X-irradiation of the left kidney. In groups 1 and 2, the right kidney was left undisturbed (2-kidney model). The rats in group 3, 4 and 5 underwent right nephrectomy 21 days before radiation (1-kidney model). Groups 1 and 3 received no drug treatment and served as controls for each model. Groups 2 and 4 had enalapril 50 mg/l in drinking water and group 5 hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) 200 mg/l, also in drinking water. Blood pressure increased significantly in both control groups and remained normal throughout the study in all treated groups. At the end of the study, mean urinary protein excretion was lower in the two enalapril-treated groups but not in HCT-treated animals. Groups 1 and 2 (2-kidney models) showed similar increments in plasma creatinine (PCreat), and, in both groups, the creatinine clearance (CCreat) dropped to the same extent. Among nephrectomized animals (1-kidney model), PCreat was lower and CCreat higher in the enalapril-treated group. Consistent with these findings, glomerular sclerosis was less severe in both enalapril-treated groups. We conclude that, in radiation nephritis, lowering blood pressure with enalapril exerts a beneficial effect on renal function and structure, whereas a similar reduction in blood pressure induced by HCT does not.", 
    "248": "A large multicentre study involving 6003 [3044 males, 2959 females; mean (+/- SD) age 59 +/- 11 years] mild-to-severe hypertensive patients was carried out to evaluate the effects of the angiotension converting enzyme inhibitor quinapril on blood pressure and on metabolic cardiovascular risk factors during 3-6 months' treatment (mean follow-up 90.4 days). The study population included 551 elderly [mean (+/- SD) age 71.9 +/- 9.3 years] patients, 1314 subjects with diabetes mellitus and 154 non-diabetic patients with hyperlipaemia; 4% of patients were lost to follow-up. Diastolic blood pressure decreased from 102 to 87 mmHg (intent-to-treat analysis) and 62% of patients were normalized (diastolic blood pressure below 90 mmHg) at the last evaluable visit. Overall, serum lipids were favourably affected during quinapril treatment; when corrected for changes in body weight, a significant improvement in total, low- and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides was detected. Quinapril treatment in elderly patients was efficacious and well tolerated, and quinapril appears to be an effective antihypertensive drug devoid of untoward effects on metabolic risk factors for cardiovascular disease.", 
    "249": "The authors report the case of an 8-year-old Libyan boy who presented with hypertension, episodes of vomiting and headaches during the past year. Routine blood tests, including nitrogen and urea clearances, were normal; an ultrasound scan and a urography demonstrated a left kidney smaller than the right. Further tests were carried out to evaluate the morphology and the function of the kidney; a scintigraphy confirmed the hypoplasia of the left kidney with reduction of the glomerular filtration rate. The arteriography of the abdominal aorta was decisive, confirming not only the hypoplasia of the left kidney, but also the presence of a hypoplasic renal artery. The latter appeared to be uniformly hypoplasic, with no signs of segmentary stenosis. This fact suggested the hypothesis of renovascular hypertension caused by a hypoplasia of the renal artery. The medical treatment with enalapril gave good results, with normalization of the pressure levels after 5 days of administration. However, only nephrectomy is able to give excellent long-term results.",

The results led the authors to the following conclusions: 1) tolerance to isosorbide dinitrate arises in 58% of the patients for 6-12 weeks under regular administration of the drug; 2) transdermal nitroglycerin (nitroderm) and in a less degree oral sustak under long-term treatment regimens become tolerable, whereas a buccal form (trinitrolong) secures a prolonged stable effect; 3) tolerance develops in 2-month administration of oral isosorbide-5-mononitrate; 4) donors of SH-group (methionine) and inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme with SH-group and without it (captopril and perindopril, respectively) in single doses potentiate an antianginal effect of isosorbide dinitrate (even in initial resistance to nitrate), being ineffective in its absence; 5) molsidomine is promising in long-term regimens as an antianginal drug alternative to nitrates.", 
    "252": "Cilazapril [correction of Silazapril], a new inhibitor of long-acting angiotensin-converting enzyme, was given to 39 hypertensive subjects aged 24-68 with initial diastolic pressure 95-120 mm Hg. Of them 16 were females and 23 were males. The course of the treatment lasted 8 weeks, the drug being taken daily in a single dose 2.5 mg in the morning. Checkups, measurements of arterial pressure (AP), blood counts, urinalyses were made before the treatment, on the treatment week 4 and 8. In one patient the drug was discontinued 4 weeks after the treatment start because the AP fall to 110/63, in 23 patients the dose was raised to 5 mg, the rest continued on 2.5 mg/day. The treatment ended in the systolic pressure decrease by 14.9% (from 161.0 +/- 2.9 to 137.8 +/- 2.8 mm Hg, p < 0.0001) and diastolic pressure fall by 13.5% (from 104.5 +/- 1.4 to 90.1 +/- 1.7 mm Hg, p < 0.005). No side effects causing the drug withdrawal were registered. It is concluded that the drug is effective in essential hypertension stage IIA-IIB as monotherapy.", 
    "253": "A limited number of enzymes such as membrane metalloendopeptidase (enkephalinase) and angiotensin converting enzyme appear to be involved in deactivation and modulation of circulatory regulatory peptides. Peptides such as the enkephalins are also involved in a large number of physiological processes. This multiplicity of physiological roles has made it difficult to establish the therapeutic role of enkephalin-degrading enzyme inhibitors. Other factors such as difficulty in quantification and thus measurement of processes involved in pain and mental illness have also hindered the process of establishing any therapeutic role of enkephalin-degrading enzyme inhibitors in these conditions. However, they have proved to be useful pharmacological 'tools'. The most likely therapeutic role at present appears to be in the treatment of cardiovascular disorders. As a 'profile' of pharmacological actions of enkephalin-degrading enzymes emerges, it is becoming apparent that bioavailability rather than a high degree of specificity or inhibitory potency may be the most important factor. This may be used to an advantage in future developments by the use of less specific or combined inhibitors in the form of prodrugs, designed to be active at specific sites such as the central nervous system.", 
    "254": "The effects of a protein load on renal haemodynamics in patients with renal failure are controversial. We measured insulin clearance (Cin) and PAH clearance (CPAH) by constant infusion technique in six healthy subjects and 13 patients with biopsy-confirmed glomerulonephritis and chronic renal failure. The subjects were pre-equilibrated on their usual diet and studied before and 2 h after 1 g protein/kg as cooked red meat. In healthy subjects this caused a significant increase of Cin (from 136 +/- 7.2 (SD) to 148 +/- 7.9 ml/min/1.73 m2) and of CPAH (from 547 +/- 142 to 639 +/- 89). In contrast Cin decreased from 72.7 +/- 7.7 to 60.3 +/- 8.4 in patients with chronic renal failure, whereas CPAH showed no significant change (from 275 +/- 67.8 to 278 +/- 72.7). A similar decrease of Cin was also seen with acute infusion of amino acids (AA). The change in Cin was not related to changes of PRA or concentrations of plasma amino acids. While absolute and fractional Na excretion increased in controls, they decreased in patients in parallel with the decrease of Cin. The decrease of Cin after infusion of AA was amplified by pre-equilibration on low-sodium diet (20 mmol Na/day). The effect of meat ingestion on Cin was not obliterated, however, by pretreatment with captopril (25 mg b.i.d. for 7 days). In conclusion, in patients with chronic renal failure, a paradoxical decrease in Cin is seen both after oral protein and after amino-acid infusion.", 
    "255": "The aim of the present investigation was to compare the acute haemodynamic and renal effects of the calcium antagonist felodipine with the ACE inhibitor ramipril and with placebo. Single oral doses of felodipine 5 and 20 mg, ramipril 2.5 and 10 mg, and placebo were given to ten healthy subjects in a double-blind cross-over study. Blood pressure, heart rate, forearm blood flow (FBF), forearm vascular resistance (FVR), renal blood flow (RBF), renal vascular resistance (RVR), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), filtration fraction (FF), diuresis, and sodium excretion were recorded for 4.75 h after administration. Felodipine 20 mg caused a significant fall in diastolic blood pressure, maximal 12% compared with placebo, while there were no significant effects of felodipine 5 mg or the two doses of ramipril. Heart rate increased significantly after both doses of felodipine, maximal 28% after the 20 mg dose. There was also a small but significant increase in heart rate of 12% after ramipril 2.5 mg. FVR fell significantly after both doses of felodipine, maximal 38% after the 20 mg dose. There were no significant changes in FVR after any of the ramipril doses. Both doses of felodipine and both doses of ramipril caused significant reductions in RVR. Maximal reduction, 33%, was found after felodipine 20 mg. There were no significant changes in GFR or FF with either drug. Felodipine caused a significant increase in natriuresis, maximal 129% while ramipril did not.", 
    "256": "In order to investigate the feasibility of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) in preventing the development of atherosclerosis and restenosis after coronary angioplasty and to study their mechanisms, we measured the platelet cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and observed the effects of captopril on platelet [Ca2+]i in rabbits and also observed the inhibitive action on fibroblast proliferation in culture. The results showed that resting platelet [Ca2+]i,ADP- or thrombin-stimulated platelet elevation amplitude after administration of captopril (12.5 mg, twice daily) for 15 days were significantly reduced in comparison with those before administration. And captopril also significantly inhibited fibroblast proliferation or reduced 3H-thymidine (3H-TdR) incorporation in culture in a dose-dependent manner. These findings suggest that ACEIs are promising drugs to reduce restenosis incidence after coronary angioplasty and to prevent atherosclerosis as well as provide a new explanation for their effects of suppressing cell proliferation.", 
    "257": "Proteinuria after strenuous exercise is common in healthy subjects. The pathophysiologic mechanism of postexercise proteinuria (PEP) is not clear, although the phenomenon has long been known and many explanatory theories have been proposed. It is widely recognized that angiotensin II may increase filtration of protein through the glomerular membrane, and that its concentration in plasma increases during exercise. The aim of this study was to evaluate possible involvement of angiotensin II in the pathogenesis of PEP. Of 25 young volunteers who performed maximal aerobic exercise, eight showed PEP. The exercise was repeated after an interval of at least one week, now 90 minutes after administration of captopril (25 mg). Captopril did not affect the achieved work load of the maximal blood pressure and heart rate during the exercise, but PEP was not found. As it was possible to prevent PEP by administering an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, the study supports the theory that the renin angiotensin system is involved in the pathogenesis of PEP.", 
    "258": "Captopril's short-term effects on clinical and biochemical parameters were studied in 21 diabetic nephropathic patients. Their mean age was 57.50 +/- 2.28 years; 16 of them were women and 5 were men. Eleven patients had been regulated with insulin and 10 of them had been regulated with oral antidiabetics. Fifteen patients were microalbuminuric (200 mg/daily and below albuminuria) and their mean diabetes mellitus history was 14.86 +/- 1.44 years. Six patients had advanced diabetic nephropathy (400 mg/daily and above albuminuria). Their mean diabetes mellitus history was 4.50 +/- 2.87 years. Captopril in a low dose (37.5 mg/daily p.o., three separated doses) was given during 20 days. In the microalbuminuria group there were insignificant alterations in renal function, blood glucose levels, and systolic blood pressure. Diastolic blood pressure decreased significantly in this group (p < .05). Microalbuminuria increased significantly after the therapy in this group (p < .05). In the advanced diabetic nephropathy group, blood glucose and systemic blood pressure levels did not change significantly (p > .05), while serum BUN and creatinine levels increased significantly (p < .05), and GFR decreased significantly in this group (p < .05). Albuminuria decreased after the therapy in this group (p < .05). In all study groups, serum potassium levels increased significantly while serum total protein and albumin levels did not change significantly.We concluded that in the microalbuminuria group, increasing microalbuminuria may be related to a captopril-induced increase in renal plasma flow rate and single nephron glomerular filtration rate. This increase in microalbuminuria cannot be related with blood glucose levels, renal functions, and systemic blood pressure alterations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "259": "This study was undertaken to determine the role of angiotensin II (AII) in the development of glomerulosclerosis, using an AII receptor antagonist in an animal model of hyperlipidemia. Hyperlipidemic Imai rats were employed because they spontaneously develop glomerulosclerosis; this is especially true in males. Group 1 (n = 5) received no specific therapy. Group 2 (n = 5) was treated with enalapril at a dosage of 50 mg/l in drinking water starting at 6 weeks of age. Group 3 (n = 5) and group 4 (n = 6) were treated with the AII receptor antagonist DuP 753 at a respective dosage of 15 mg/l (low-dose DuP) and 150 mg/l (high-dose DuP) in drinking water. Body weight, blood pressure, urinary protein, serum albumin, cholesterol, BUN and serum creatinine were measured and compared among the groups from 12 to 24 weeks of age. Enalapril and high-dose DuP were almost equally effective in controlling systemic hypertension. Each treatment significantly reduced proteinuria (172 +/- 112 and 152 +/- 72 mg/kg/day at 24 weeks) as compared with that in the controls (421 +/- 147 mg/kg/day; p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively). Hypercholesterolemia also decreased (82 +/- 4 and 89 +/- 6 mg/dl) as compared with that of the controls (141 +/- 48 mg/dl; both p < 0.05).

A significant reduction of arterial blood pressure was seen after both treatment regimens. Circulating plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide and triglyceride concentrations were measured at hourly intervals from 8.00 a.m. to 5.00 p.m. in patients on an isocaloric diet (35 cal/kg/day). Plasma glucose concentrations remained unchanged, while insulin and C-peptide concentrations were higher in association with hydrochlorothiazide treatment. Conversely, lisinopril-treated patients had lower C-peptide concentrations after treatment. The changes in daylong plasma glucose and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake increased after hydrochlorothiazide treatment and decreased following lisinopril. Lastly, plasma cholesterol concentrations did not change after lisinopril therapy, whereas plasma high density cholesterol decreased as a result of hydrochlorothiazide treatment.", 
    "261": "Hypertension associated with ciclosporin A may be mediated by sodium and volume retention. Therefore, the effects of an antihypertensive therapy (6 weeks) with nitrendipine (10-20 mg twice daily) or lisinopril (10-20 mg once daily) on office blood pressure, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure, and left ventricular function were evaluated in a randomised, double-blind cross-over trial in patients after heart transplantation. Nitrendipine and lisinopril were equally effective in lowering office and ambulatory systolic and diastolic blood pressures. After an acute sodium load (210 mval/2 h i.v.), sodium excretion was significantly increased during therapy with lisinopril but only slightly during nitrendipine, indicating that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition may improve the sodium-retaining state of heart transplant recipients associated with ciclosporin A.",

The results were evaluated according to the changes in NYHA classes and echocardiographic parameters. Significant improvement was observed in response to Tensiomin in 38 of the 52 patients (73%). On the basis of the results the use of captopril (Tensiomin) is highly recommended for the treatment of ischaemic dilatative cardiomyopathy.", 
    "263": "The potential effect of moexipril, a new converting enzyme inhibitor, on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a single dose of warfarin has been investigated. Ten healthy male volunteers received in a randomised crossover fashion a single oral dose of 50 mg warfarin sodium alone and together with the first dose of 6 days of oral treatment with moexipril 15 mg o.d. Mean oral plasma clearance of (R)-warfarin was 175 ml.h-1 in the absence and 181 ml.h-1 in the presence of moexipril, and the corresponding values for (S)-warfarin were 248 ml.h-1 and 249 ml.h-1. Apparent volume of distribution, peak plasma concentration, time to reach peak concentration and area under the plasma concentration-time curve both of (R)- and (S)-warfarin were not significantly affected. Moexipril did not alter the maximum prothrombin time (20.3 versus 20.1 s, respectively in the absence and presence of moexipril), time to maximum response (48.0 versus 50 h) and area under the prothrombin time versus time curve. The results suggest that a clinically important interaction between moexipril and warfarin is unlikely to occur in patients treated with both drugs.",

Propranolol and placebo, ramipril and placebo, or propranolol and ramipril were given orally for four days in a crossover, double-blind fashion. The pharmacokinetics of ramipril and ramiprilat were investigated on day 4. Effects on plasma renin activity, ACE activity, and heart rate and blood pressure both before and after a standardized exercise test were measured on days 1 and 4. On day 4 the combination reduced the mean arterial pressure by 2.8 mmHg compared with propranolol alone and by 3.7 mmHg compared with ramipril alone. Ramipril had no effect on the bradycardia induced by propranolol. Propranolol reduced exercise mean arterial pressure by 9 mmHg (day 4) and heart rate by 7 beats.min-1 (day 4) compared with ramipril; this was not affected by co-administration of ramipril. On day 4 the average plasma renin activity was not significantly higher than after the combination. ACE activity was not affected by propranolol. The pharmacokinetics of ramipril and ramiprilat were not influenced by propranolol. The combination of ramipril and propranolol has additive pharmacodynamic effects that may be useful in the treatment of hypertension.",

The absorption and elimination of spirapril did not differ between patients with liver disease and control subjects. In contrast, the bioavailability of spiraprilat, the metabolite responsible for the pharmacological action of spirapril, was significantly reduced in patients (AUC 820 micrograms.h.l-1, 923 micrograms.h.l-1 and 1300 micrograms.h.l-1 in patients with cirrhosis, patients with non-cirrhotic liver disease and in healthy subjects, respectively. Compared to healthy subjects, cirrhotic patients had a reduced rate constant of spiraprilat formation (1.10 h-1 in patients vs. 2.00 h-1 in control subjects) while the elimination half-life of spiraprilat was not different. The effect of spirapril on diastolic blood pressure was decreased in patients with chronic liver disease as compared to the controls. Thus, the pharmacokinetics of spirapril was unchanged in patients with different types of liver disease, including cirrhosis. However, the bioavailability of spiraprilat and hypotensive effect of spirapril were reduced in patients.", 
    "266": "The aim of the present study was primarily to evaluate the haemodynamic effects of the ACE-inhibitor ramipril which is active via its metabolite ramiprilat. Ramipril 1.25, 2.5 and 5 mg and placebo was administered orally to 4 groups of 12 patients with heart failure (NYHA III) in a double-blind randomised, parallel study. Haemodynamics were monitored for 24 h and blood was sampled and urine collected for up to 96 h. In the placebo-treated group the cardiac index (CI) was significantly increased (15.8%) and right atrial pressure decreased (26.6%). Ramipril 1.25 mg had insignificant haemodynamic effects compared to placebo and the 2.5 mg dose had significant effects on some haemodynamic variables. Ramipril 5 mg had pronounced and sustained effects on pulmonary artery pressure, which fell by 43.7%, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP; -59.1%); systemic vascular resistance was also decreased 21%. A significant effect on CI was only seen after 2.5 mg ramipril (+7.4%). The mean maximal degree of ACE inhibition was 73.2, 90.4 and 98.5%, respectively, after the three doses of ramipril. Complete inhibition of ACE-activity was seen at a mean plasma concentration of ramiprilat of 4.7 ng.ml-1. The degree of inhibition declined with a half life of about 75 h. There was a significant relation between the degree of ACE-inhibition and change in PCWP but not with the change in SVR. Ramipril was mainly eliminated in the form of ramiprilat and inactive metabolites.", 
    "267": "Plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma concentrations of angiotensin II (AngII), atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) were determined in the abdominal aorta and the renal veins before and 1 h after peroral ingestion of captopril 25 mg in 29 patients with arterial hypertension and unilateral renal artery stenosis or occlusion, in order to study the effect of ACE inhibition on single-kidney extraction ratio (ER) of PRA, AngII, ANP, and AVP, and on renal vein renin ratio (RVRR). PRA was increased, AngII and ANP were reduced, and AVP unchanged after captopril. On the affected side the negative ER or PRA (-1.03) and AngII (-0.28) and the positive ER of ANP (0.25) and AVP (0.14) were not significantly changed by captopril. On the non-affected side ER of AngII and ER of ANP were significantly reduced (ER of AngII, 0.41-0.00, ER of ANP, 0.29-0.17), but ER of PRA and ER of AVP were unchanged. RVRR was not significantly changed by captopril. RVRR was greater than 1.5 in 79% of the patients before captopril, in 82% after captopril, and in 93% either before or after captopril. It is concluded that captopril reduces ER of AngII and ER of ANP on the non-affected side but not on the affected side in unilateral renal artery disease with hypertension, and that the use of RVRR both before and after captopril improves the predictive value of RVRR with regard to the diagnosis of unilateral renal artery disease.",

We examined the effect of a once-a-day theophylline formulation on ACE inhibitor-induced cough and on the sensitivity of the cough reflex to capsaicin in 10 hypertensive patients who had developed cough during treatment with an ACE inhibitor. Theophylline did not induce bronchodilation but induced complete remission of clinical symptoms in 8 and attenuated the capsaicin-induced cough number in 7 subjects when compared with placebo. Theophylline may thus be effective in preventing ACE inhibitor-induced cough.", 
    "270": "Age-related changes in aldosterone response of the adrenal cortex to exogenous angiotensin II were studied in old compared to adult Long-Evans female rats. All animals were pretreated with dexamethasone and captopril and anesthetized with pentobarbital. Continuous infusion of angiotensin II (20 and 300 ng/min per 100 g body weight) for 20 and 30 min markedly enhanced the plasma concentration of aldosterone; however, the plasma aldosterone incremental response was significantly lower (-66.8% after the highest dose of angiotensin II) in old than in adult rats. These results, the first in the rat, suggest that the previously reported diminished aldosterone secretion is, at least in part, due to an impaired aldosterone biosynthesis capacity of the adrenal glomerular cells in response to angiotensin II.",

Blood pressure changes were measured conventionally in the clinic and by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Clinic blood pressure decreased from 168.3 +/- 13.8/105.5 +/- 5.4 mm Hg to 137.5 +/- 4.1/88.8 +/- 4.1 mm Hg (p < 0.005 for both systolic and diastolic blood pressures), and the heart rate from 75.2 +/- 3.7 to 74.4 +/- 7.6 beats per minute (NS).

    "272": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is believed to play a central role in the pathophysiology of heart failure. However, there is a wide variability in plasma renin levels in patients with heart failure, and normal plasma renin activity has been documented in patients with mild or compensated disease. Recent evidence has demonstrated the existence of endogenous RAS in a number of tissues associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. It is possible that these tissue RAS are activated in the early stages of heart failure when plasma renin activity is normal, and therefore contribute to the progression of this condition. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduce both circulating and tissue RAS activity. They are of symptomatic benefit and reduce the mortality associated with heart failure. A number of large studies initiated to investigate the effects of the ACE inhibitor enalapril in patients with all degrees of heart failure have been published recently. These studies show that addition of this drug to therapy significantly decreases patient morbidity and mortality, an effect which is most likely due to the suppression of circulating and tissue RAS activity this agent affords. The relationship of the profile of hormonal suppression seen with enalapril and drug dosage to observed beneficial effects on morbidity or mortality is unclear. Given the large range of alternative ACE inhibitors available, their variable structure, potency and duration of action, the potential for differences between agents needs further consideration. Although direct comparative studies are rare, there is a body of work suggesting that such differentiation may be present and may be of clinical significance.",

However, human kidneys also progressively deteriorate once they have suffered a certain degree of initial damage. Various therapeutic approaches to slowdown the progression of chronic renal disease [low-protein diets, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, etc.] seem promising. Large-scale, ongoing clinical studies may offer definitive answers to their place in the management of progressive renal disease. Diabetic nephropathy, the most common cause of end-stage renal failure, follows a distinct course in insulin dependent diabetes mellitus DM (IDDM); this is less well defined in non-insulin dependent DM (NIDDM). Micro-albuminuria is an important hallmark of early diabetic kidney disease, when it may still be amenable to therapeutic interventions. Strict glycemic control, and ACE inhibitors may be beneficial in early stages of diabetic nephropathy. Less is known on use of calcium-channel blockers and low-protein diets in diabetic nephropathy. There is also a paucity of information on management of diabetic nephropathy in type II DM.",

Ten of these 13 patients were normotensive. None had diabetes mellitus. In a randomized cross-over design with two treatment periods of 6 weeks, each preceded by a washout period of 4 weeks, patients were treated with benazepril (20 mg o.d.) and the combination of metoprolol (200 mg o.d.) and chlorthalidone (25 mg o.d.). At the end of the treatment periods with benazepril or metoprolol/chlorthalidone mean arterial pressure was lowered to a similar degree by 7.4 (mean, 95% confidence interval 2.0-12.7) and 9.7 (5.7-13.7) mmHg respectively. Both treatment modalities caused similar reductions in proteinuria, being 3.4 g/24 h (mean, 95% confidence interval 2.1-4.8) on benazepril and 3.2 (1.2-5.1) g/24 h on metoprolol/chlorthalidone. Glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow were slightly less during metoprolol/chlorthalidone treatment. Subgroup analysis of normotensive patients gave similar results. In conclusion, in these patients with glomerular disease angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition was not more effective than the conventional treatment with the combination of a beta blocker and a diuretic in reducing blood pressure and proteinuria. Both treatments reduced proteinuria not only in hypertensive, but also in normotensive patients.", 
    "276": "Hypertensive emergencies in hemodialysis require immediate therapy, usually by parenteral drug administration; however, sublingual medications may have potential in this special condition. Sublingual captopril (25 mg), nifedipine (10 mg) and prazosin (2 mg) were prescribed to determine the effectiveness and safety of each medication in the treatment of hypertensive emergencies during hemodialysis. Blood pressure and heart rate were measured continuously up to 120 min postdose. The response rates were 83% for captopril, 90% for nifedipine and 11% for prazosin. The significant hypotensive effects of both sublingual captopril and nifedipine occurred at 10 min and continued up to 120 min. The reduction of systolic blood pressure occurred earlier in nifedipine than captopril (10 vs. 15 min). No significant difference in heart rate between them was noted. There were no side effects in the captopril group but flushing, tachycardia and headache were observed in 4 patients of the nifedipine group. We concluded that sublingual captopril and nifedipine were effective but captopril seemed to have less side effects than nifedipine and may be an excellent alternative to sublingual nifedipine in the urgent treatment of hypertensive emergencies in hemodialysis. Prazosin was not recommended because of its low response rate.",

Morphofunctionally, myocardial lesion was of a dilated type in 50 patients (36 DC, 10 IHD and 4 EH cases), of a hypertrophic type in 18 patients (4 IHD, 14 EH cases), of a mixed type in 17 IHD patients. The response to acute tests with 25 mg captopril and 20 mg nifedipine along with clinicohemodynamic results of 3-5-week course treatment with the drugs point to noticeable advantage of captopril in the dilated lesion (18 responders of 26 patients), while nifedipine in the hypertrophic type (10 responders of 10 patients). In mixed-type IHD patients both drugs displayed high efficacy.", 
    "278": "The authors have compared the ability of two non-SH-containing angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (enalaprilat and lisinopril) with an -SH containing ACE inhibitor (captopril) to scavenge the hydroxyl radical (.OH). All three compounds were able to scavenge .OH radicals generated in free solution at approximately diffusion-controlled rates (10(10) M-1 s-1) as established by the deoxyribose assay in the presence of EDTA. The compounds also inhibited deoxyribose degradation in reaction mixtures which did not contain EDTA but not so effectively. This later findings also suggests that they have some degree of metal-binding capability. Chemiluminescence assays of oxidation of hypoxanthine by xanthine oxidase in the presence of luminol, confirm that the three ACE inhibitors are oxygen free radical scavengers. Our results indicate that the presence of a sulphydryl group in the chemical structure of ACE inhibitors is not relevant for their oxygen free radical scavenging ability.", 
    "279": "A defective myocardial energy supply--due to lack of substrates and/or essential cofactors and a poor utilization efficiency of oxygen--may be a common final pathway in the progression of myocardial diseases of various etiologies. The vitamin-like essential substance coenzyme Q10, or ubiquinone, is a natural antioxidant and has a key role in oxidative phosphorylation. A biochemical rationale for using coenzyme Q10 as a therapy in heart disease was established years ago by Folkers and associates; however, this has been further strengthened by investigations of viable myocardial tissue from the author's series of 45 patients with various cardiomyopathies. Myocardial tissue levels of coenzyme Q10 determined by high-performance lipid chromatography were found to be significantly lower in patients with more advanced heart failure compared with those in the milder stages of heart failure. Furthermore, the myocardial tissue coenzyme Q10 deficiency might be restored significantly by oral supplementation in selected cases. In the author's open clinical protocol study with coenzyme Q10 therapy (100 mg daily) nearly two-thirds of patients revealed clinical improvement, most pronounced in those with dilated cardiomyopathy. Double-blind placebo-controlled trials have definitely confirmed that coenzyme Q10 has a place as adjunctive treatment in heart failure with beneficial effects on the clinical outcome, the patients' physical activity, and their quality of life. The positive results have been above and beyond the clinical status obtained from treatment with traditional principles--including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "280": "Myocardial infarction has become the most important condition causing congestive heart failure. Several treatment regimens compete with each other in the early and later post myocardial infarction phase focussing on different pathophysiologic mechanisms. In this review emphasis is put on absolute risks and absolute risk reductions in patients with left ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction. In the first year mortality is still as high as 10% and the major risks are sudden unexpected death, reinfarction, and congestive heart failure. In the following years sudden death and development of congestive heart failure become less prominent, while a considerable risk of reinfarction persists. Thrombolysis and beta-blockade are the most important drugs in the acute infarction phase leading to a marked reduction in one year mortality. In the first year after infarction beta-blockade has an established place in the prevention of sudden death; revascularization and aspirin are established in reinfarction prophylaxis. However, since most drugs lower 1 year mortality by 0.5 to 2% only, drugs like ACE inhibitors that influence more than one risk, i.e. sudden death and reinfarction as well as deterioration of pump dysfunction might play a more important role in the therapeutic strategy after myocardial infarction. A supplementation by one or two drugs aiming at the individually estimated leading risks might be the best choice in patients with left ventricular dysfunction today.", 
    "281": "Vasodilator therapy has been utilized for the treatment of congestive heart failure in the last 20 years. These drugs contribute to increase cardiac output, decrease peripheral vascular resistance and favour venous dilatation. Recent multicenter trials have addressed the issue of the impact of vasodilator therapy upon survival. Thus, the VHEFT-I and Consensus studies have shown that both the combination of nitrates and hydralazine and ACF inhibitors improve life expectancy in patients with moderate and severe heart failure. Moreover, the SOLVD study showed that ACE inhibitors improve survival and reduce cardiac events in patients with mild heart failure and depressed myocardial function at the end of 2 years of follow-up. The VHEFT II trial compared the effects of the nitrate-hydralazine combination versus ACE inhibitors upon the clinical course of patients with moderate heart failure. This last trial showed that although nitrates and hydralazine exerted a slightly better benefit upon exercise tolerance and left ventricular ejection fraction, patients that were treated with ACE inhibitors had a significantly reduced mortality. Differences in mortality when both groups of vasodilators drugs were compared were due to reduction of arrhythmias and sudden death. It is likely that this greater benefit obtained with ACE inhibitors when compared to nitrates and hydralazine in heart failure might be due to their favourable effects upon the abnormal neurohormonal activation observed in this syndrome. Thus ACE inhibitors have turned out to be one of the cornerstones in the treatment of congestive heart failure.", 
    "282": "Hyperlipidemia in the nephrotic syndrome is the result of abnormalities in both synthesis and catabolism of lipids and lipoproteins. The etiology of nephrotic hyperlipidemia has not been established, but both abnormal glomerular permeability to plasma proteins and reduced serum oncotic pressure may contribute. Although standard hypolipemic drugs are effective in nephrotic patients, therapies such as dietary protein restriction and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors which reduce proteinuria and increase serum oncotic pressure ameliorate hyperlipidemia as well. Hyperlipidemia may also induce proteinuric renal disease in normal animals and worsen renal injury in a variety of animal models of kidney disease. Conversely, treatment of hyperlipidemia prevents renal injury and lessens proteinuria. Potential mechanisms by which hyperlipidemia may cause renal injury include inflammatory and immunologically mediated injury and alteration of glomerular paracrine function.", 
    "283": "We have studied 250 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension (diastolic blood pressure 95-114 mmHg) and dyslipidaemia (high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) below 1.03 mmol.l-1, total cholesterol 5.17-9.05 mmol.l-1, and triglycerides 2.26-5.64 mmol.l-1) in a controlled double-blind, multicentre, parallel group trial. The patients took a fat-modified diet. After a 4-week placebo period, patients who continued to fulfil the selection criteria were randomly allocated to treatment with either carvedilol (a vasodilating beta-blocker) 25-50 mg o.d. (n = 116) or captopril (an ACE inhibitor) 25-50 mg o.d. (n = 117) for 6 months. In both groups there were favourable effects on the serum lipids. The relative changes (medians) in the carvedilol and captopril group were respectively: increase in HDL-C by 11% and 8%, decrease in total cholesterol by 11% and 10%, in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 16% and 12%, and in triglycerides by 13% and 14%. Equivalence of the two treatments was confirmed for the target variable change in HDL-C at a significance level of 5%. Reductions in supine systolic/diastolic blood pressures were comparable in the two groups (carvedilol: 23/19 mmHg, captopril: 20/18 mmHg). The improvement in lipid metabolism in patients treated with carvedilol is probably due to its alpha 1-blocking properties.", 
    "284": "We have shown that, within therapeutic plasma concentrations, the unbound fraction of furosemide changes in direct proportion to the reciprocal of the plasma albumin concentration (correlation coefficient 0.99). Changes in the albumin concentration were produced by ultrafiltration of human plasma using a haemofiltration filter. Thus, we propose that, when studying changes in the pharmacokinetics of a highly protein bound drug, calculated changes in the unbound fraction offer an alternative to actual measurement of the unbound concentration, which is often difficult. Nine healthy volunteers receiving a continuous furosemide infusion were studied in normovolaemia and after dehydration (-1.4 kg), with and without pretreatment with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (captopril) or an a1-adrenoceptor blocking agent (prazosin). Significantly larger changes in the renal clearance of furosemide were found that could be explained by changes in the unbound fraction. Following dehydration, the unbound fraction of furosemide was decreased by about 5%, while its renal clearance fell by 27%, 33% and 13% after pretreatment with placebo, captopril and prazosin, respectively. The secretory clearance of the unbound furosemide changed substantially and in parallel with changes in the renal blood flow. It is suggested that changes in the renal clearance and excretion of furosemide and its t1/2 are much more dependent on changes in renal blood flow than on changes in its unbound fraction.", 
    "285": "Acute effects of 20 mg oral enalapril (E), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, on renal function and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system were investigated in 13 patients with type II diabetes mellitus (8 female, 5 male) and 10 hypertensive controls using a radionuclide method. Plasma glucose control was evaluated with fructosamine (F) determinations. After intravenous administration of 370 MBq 99mTc-DTPA, sequential images were recorded. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), perfusion index (PI), time to maximum activity and reno index values of the kidneys were calculated. Two days later, renal scintigraphy was repeated after oral administration of E. Plasma levels of renin, angiotensin II and aldosterone were analyzed using RIA. Basal GFR values (mean: 92.6 ml/min) correlated with F (r = 0.364; p < 0.05). In the diabetic group, 5 patients had a decrease in GFR and an increase in PI after oral E. The mean percent change of GFR was 12 +/- 32 for patients and 20 +/- 12 for controls, respectively. Percent change of GFR had a slightly negative correlation with F values (r = -0.51; p < 0.05) and with PI (r = -0.65; p < 0.001). The patients with good metabolic control had an increase in GFR and a decrease in PI indicating an increase in renal blood flow and glomerular filtration. In patients with proteinuria and poorly controlled diabetes, in response to E-induced efferent arteriolar dilation, there is a decrease in GFR and an increase in PI which indicates a fall in filtration and renal blood flow. This glomerular hemodynamic pathology precedes morphological changes due to diabetes.", 
    "286": "1062 patients with moderate to severe hypertension were enrolled in an open-label multicenter trial investigating the antihypertensive efficacy and safety of the preconstituted formulation enalapril (20 mg) and hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg) over a treatment period of 12 weeks. According to the inclusion criteria of the study protocol 489 patients had to be excluded from statistical evaluation of efficacy. Results were calculated from 573 patients (339 females, 234 males, mean age 59.1 +/- 12.3 years) of whom 89% (n = 510) received the standard dosage of 1 tablet daily. They revealed a significant reduction (p < 0.001) of both diastolic and systolic blood pressure (BP) from a mean of 108.2 +/- 7.8 mm Hg (182.2 +/- 17.6 mm Hg) before treatment to a mean of 88.4 +/- 6.7 mm Hg (152.6 +/- 10.8 respectively) after 12 weeks of treatment. 81% responded to therapy defined as a lowering of diastolic BP < 90 mm Hg. Heart frequency dropped significantly (from a mean of 77.8 +/- 10.6 to a mean of 71.7 +/- 8.0, p < 0.01), too. Adverse effects leading to discontinuation were seen in 2.8% (n = 30) of all participating patients. Cough and gastrointestinal discomfort were the most frequent side effects. None of the safety parameters i.e. serum potassium and creatinine changed during the period of investigation. In conclusion, the preconstituted formulation enalapril (20 mg) and hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg) was shown to be an effective and well tolerated treatment not only for patients with newly diagnosed moderate to severe hypertension, but also for nonresponders to previous antihypertensive therapy.", 
    "287": "An examination was made of 22 hypertensive patients with clinical and echoCG symptoms of left ventricular hypertrophy. All the patients underwent coronary angiography, transvenous multiphase left ventriculography and acute captopril (11 patients), nifedipine (11 patients) tests. A single oral 25 mg dose of captopril increased energetic efficacy of cardiocycle, restored diastolic function of the left ventricle, aroused myocardial contractility.", 
    "288": "The effects of capoten on hemostasis were studied in 63 patients with Stages I and II hypertensive disease in relation to the hemodynamic type and severity of the disease. Thrombophilia was revealed just at the onset of the disease mainly due to hemostatic endothelial dysfunction which progresses with the hemodynamic development of hypertensive disease. Capoten optimizes hemostatic parameters by affecting endothelial function, which serves an additional mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of the drug. Supplementary techniques affecting the rheological properties should be used in the treatment of hypertensives with moderate-to-serve courses along with resistive hemodynamics.", 
    "289": "The efficacy of captopril (capoten) and digoxin was comparatively studied in long-term randomized, double blind trials of 22 male patients with postinfarction cardiosclerosis, functional classes I-III and preserved sinus rhythm. The optimal doses of the drugs proved to be small (0.31 and 35 mg/day of digoxin and capoten, respectively). No adverse effects were noted. The mortality rate was 10 and 16.7% with digoxin and captopril, respectively. The drugs equally improved the functional class by 0.51 and 0.45 and VO2 max by 1.5 and 1.7 ml/min. Digoxin had a mild effect on heart rate (-8.4%) and ejection fraction (+5.7%) and deteriorated diastolic relaxation, by slowing down the early peak of transmitral Doppler spectrum by 16.2%. Captopril significantly improved diastolic function by increasing the early peak by 17.2%. No significant changes in left ventricular sizes were recorded. The clinical efficacy of captopril was explained by a significant decrease in angiotension II (70%) and norepinephrine (40%) levels and by associated normalization of baroreflex regulation. Digoxin insignificantly affected the levels of angiotensin II and norepinephrine, but improved the baroreceptor regulation of sympathetic control impaired in chronic heart failure. It is concluded that extracardiac mechanisms play a major role in the action of not only captopril, but digoxin in the treatment of patients with postinfarct cardiosclerosis and chronic heart failure with sinus rhythm.", 
    "290": "Previous studies from our laboratory have indicated an important role for angiotensin II (AII) in the regulation of renal medullary haemodynamics during normal physiological conditions. In order to investigate further the influence of endogenous AII on the juxtamedullary vascular resistance in anaesthetized rats the velocity of fluorescently-labeled red cells (vRBC) was measured with a cross-correlation technique in the vasa recta before and after infusion of the angiotensin I- converting enzyme inhibitor captopril or vehicle. Irrespective of treatment, vRBC was higher in the descending vasa recta (DVR) than in the ascending vasa recta (AVR). In time control animals VRBC in DVR and AVR and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) remained stable over the 45 min study period. In animals receiving captopril (3 mg.h-1.kg-1 bw) vRBC increased almost proportionally in DVR and AVR; by 26% in DVR (from 1.02 +/- 0.12 to 1.28 +/- 0.10 mm.s-1, p < 0.05) and by 19% in AVR (from 0.46 +/- 0.05 to 0.55 +/- 0.07 mm.s-1, p < 0.05). MAP decreased by 9% (from 107 +/- 3 to 97 +/- 2 mm Hg, p < 0.05). These results give further support to the suggestion of an involvement of AII in the regulation of juxtamedullary vascular resistance during normal physiological conditions.", 
    "291": "Experiments were designed to examine whether inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system alters gastric mucosal damage in conscious rats subjected to restraint. Two hours immobilization resulted in an ulcer index of 46 +/- 4 (n = 16) which was decreased by converting enzyme inhibitor (MK 422, enalaprilat) doses of 1 and 10 mg.kg-1.h-1 by 50 +/- 16 (n = 8) and 66 +/- 8% (n = 13), respectively (p < 0.05). Gastric blood flow measured by both the 99Tc-labelled frog erythrocytes and 86Rb-clearance methods was low in untreated rats and increased to more than three-fold in angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor treated animals. Infusion of saralasin a specific angiotensin II receptor blocker (5 micrograms.kg-1.h-1, n = 25) also decreased the ulcer index by 40 +/- 5% (p < 0.05). Thus inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system in conscious cold-restraint rat increased gastric blood flow and reduced mucosal damage. These results suggest that the renin-angiotensin system plays a significant role in the development of experimental gastric ulcer in the cold-restraint model.", 
    "292": "To evaluate the effect of delayed treatment with enalapril or lovastatin on the progression of glomerulosclerosis and to examine if the combined treatment with enalapril and lovastatin show synergistic effect, a total of 31 Sprague-Dawley rats were studied for 16 weeks following 5/6 nephrectomy (NPX). Treatment was delayed until 8 weeks after NPX. In untreated control rats (n = 8), sustained systemic hypertension with increasing proteinuria, serum cholesterol, triglyceride, BUN and widespread glomerulosclerosis and mesangial expansion were observed. Treatment with enalapril alone (R, n = 8) reversed systemic hypertension, prevented a further increase in proteinuria, and significantly reduced glomerulosclerosis relative to the control group. Treatment with lovastatin alone (L, n = 7) also reduced glomerulosclerosis and serum cholesterol compared to the controls. The drug also prevented a further increase in proteinuria and systemic blood pressure although the difference from the control rats did not reach statistical significance. Treatment with both enalapril and lovastatin (RL, n = 8) almost completely prevented glomerulosclerosis and significantly reduced mesangial expansion, systemic blood pressure, serum cholesterol, and proteinuria compared to controls. Only the combined treatment stabilized BUN and reduced mesangial expansion compared to control R, or L groups. Conclusion. Delayed treatment with enalapril or lovastatin is effective in preventing the progression of glomerulosclerosis, and combined treatment appears to show synergistic effect in 5/6 nephrectomized rat model.", 
    "293": "Enhanced formation of radicals during post-ischemic reperfusion, foremost of superoxide (O2-) and hydroxyl (OH) radicals, has been directly and indirectly demonstrated in a number of tissues. However, the close chemical interrelationship of O2- and OH with other non-radical oxidants, such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and hypochlorous acid (HOCl), makes it prudent to speak of reactive oxygen metabolites in conjunction with cell and organ dysfunction incurred by reperfusion. In the case of the heart, evidence for the causal involvement of such reactive molecular species includes (1) the increased formation of lipid peroxides, (2) the ability to mimic all facets of reperfusion injury (arrhythmias, contractile and vascular dysfunction, infarct extension) by exogenously applying reactive oxygen species, and (3) the propensity of a great variety of antioxidative and radical scavenging measures to afford cardioprotection during reperfusion. Potential sources of reactive oxygen metabolites in the reperfused heart are the mitochondrial redox-chain, endothelial enzymes such as cyclooxygenase, monoaminooxidase, NO-synthase and xanthine oxidase, and formed blood constituents (platelets, monocytes, granulocytes). According to our own results, adenosine, endogenously formed in the heart during ischemia, rapidly enhances adhesion of granulocytes introduced into the coronary system at reperfusion. Furthermore, small numbers of these cells suffice to induce contractile dysfunction in an isolated guinea pig heart model of ischemia-reperfusion injury, the major mediator of damage being HOCl. The striking disparity between the enormous volume of experimental data supporting involvement of reactive oxygen metabolites in reperfusion damage and the virtual lack of clinical-therapeutic regimens employing anti-oxidative measures is largely due to a still rudimentary knowledge of the homeostatic control of formation and removal of radicals and oxidants. In particular, the inability to correctly assess the individual time-course and extent of oxidative stress seems to be a major problem. Also, confounding issues such as compartmentation of radical formation as opposed to radical scavenging and the unwitting down-regulation of endogenous protective systems (e.g., of uric acid in the course of inhibiting xanthine oxidase) need to be resolved. On the other hand, we have been able to demonstrate protection by ACE inhibitors elicited via endothelially produced nitric oxide (a scavenger of O2- and OH) in the isolated heart. Thus, enhancement of endogenous protection may offer a perspective for mitigating against reperfusion damage.", 
    "294": "To stop or reverse progression of congestive heart failure is so far an unreached therapeutic goal. Several prospective studies have now clearly shown that treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors resulted in a clear reduction of cardiovascular and total mortality in patients with congestive heart failure. As a consequence, ACE-inhibitors are now standard therapy for congestive heart failure in addition to diuretics and glycosides. Of pathophysiologic importance is that ACE-inhibitors are potent vasodilators and counteract the neuroendocrine stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system which both contribute to the detrimental outcome in congestive heart failure. New results of the prevention trial of the SOLVD-Study showed that in patients with reduced ejection fraction the development of congestive heart failure could be attenuated or even stopped. The questions remain of what is the optimal dose, when should treatment with ACE-inhibitors be started, and how long should it be maintained. Thus, in patients with reduced ejection fraction after myocardial infarction ACE-inhibitors are today a cornerstone for preventing progressive congestive heart failure and improving cardiovascular prognosis. Whether beta-blockers offer additional benefit in subgroups of patients with congestive heart failure remains to be determined in future trials.", 
    "295": "New pathophysiological insights in the last few years on the development of diabetic nephropathy have led to a change in therapeutic measures. The emphasis is put on preventive considerations for the insulin-dependent diabetic patient. Strict control of glycemia and the early use of an angiotensin-conversion inhibitor are of importance. Therapy of the manifest diabetic nephropathy is based on strict metabolic control combined with reduced protein intake. Furthermore, an often co-existing hypertension needs to be treated. Normotensive blood pressure should be obtained. ACE-inhibitors and Ca-antagonists have been proven to be very effective, although there seem to exist differences in the type of Ca-antagonists regarding effectiveness on albuminuria. The combination of ACE-inhibitors and Ca-antagonists seems to have an additional beneficial impact on albuminuria. A significant decrease in the loss of glomerular function and a decrease in albuminuria can be obtained by consistent consideration of these therapeutic strategies.", 
    "296": "The main important diagnostic and therapeutic problems in hypertensive heart disease refer to the further improvement in the diagnostic procedures in hypertensive hypertrophy; moreover, structural changes of the hypertrophied myocardium have to be analyzed. Quantitative findings concerning the coronary circulation as well as the global and regional myocardial perfusion are desirable. The incidence of ventricular arrhythmias has to be clarified. Further diagnostic studies are needed with regard to the rheological changes as well to the mechanisms for silent and manifest myocardial ischemia. From the therapeutic point of view future studies are desirable concerning the regression of myocardial and vascular hypertrophy, with the aim to find out the optimal therapy for treating both high blood pressure and the hypertension induced structural myocardial and vascular alterations.", 
    "297": "Several well controlled multicenter trials demonstrated the great value of ACE-inhibitors in the treatment of heart failure. Interestingly, the mechanisms by which ACE-inhibitors improve survival of patients with heart failure are ony poorly understood. Interesting new aspects regarding the role of the renin angiotensin system in the pathophysiology of heart failure emerged from modern methods of molecular biology. For example, several alleles of the angiotensin converting enzyme or angiotensinogen genes were related to hypertension and myocardial infarction in both clinical and experimental studies. Furthermore, local renin angiotensin systems have been demonstrated in various cardiovascular tissues. These tissue renin angiotensin systems are independently regulated and may be activated in heart failure or cardiac hypertrophy. Finally, it has been shown that inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme affects also the metabolism of bradykinin and aldosterone which may contribute to the overall pharmacodynamic profile of ACE-inhibitors in heart failure.", 
    "298": "In vitro experiments have related anaphylactoid reactions in patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors during dialysis with AN69 membranes to excessive bradykinin generation using this negatively charged dialysis membrane. In the present clinical trial plasma bradykinin levels were followed during the early phase of dialysis in 10 patients, not being treated with ACE inhibitors, using AN69, cuprophane, and polysulfone membranes. Bradykinin was measured after extraction by radioimmunoassay. During this study one episode of anaphylaxis occurred during dialysis with the AN69 membrane. Blood samples were collected during the first 5 min of the adverse reaction and showed a more than 100-fold increase in the venous effluent of the AN69 dialyzer (baseline 40 +/- 3 vs. 4,900 +/- 130 fmol/ml after 5 min). Even though none of the patients received ACE inhibitors, there were 4 more asymptomatic individuals who displayed a more than two-fold increase in their plasma bradykinin concentrations in the venous effluent of the AN69 dialyzer. When these patients were treated either with cuprophane or with polysulfone dialyzers, no significant bradykinin formation was detected, nor were there any adverse events. Taken together, these findings show that anaphylactoid reactions with the AN69 membrane are due to excessive bradykinin generation which even may occur in the absence of ACE inhibitors.", 
    "299": "A 35-year-old renal transplant patient with stable renal function developed an unexplained anaemia. Appropriate investigations proved non-diagnostic. Only when enalapril therapy was stopped did the anaemia reverse and haemoglobin levels returned to pre-treatment levels. An association between angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and anaemia in patients with renal failure is becoming more evident. A literature review of this problem and its possible pathogenesis in patients with renal failure is given.", 
    "300": "Proteinuria is the primary manifestation of a variety of glomerular diseases which are characterized clinically by the nephrotic syndrome. In many cases there is little effective treatment for the primary disease process. However, reduction of proteinuria can frequently improve the hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia and edema which are responsible for the morbidity of the nephrotic syndrome. Proteinuria can be reduced in nephrotic humans and experimental animal models by restriction of dietary protein intake, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, and by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Each of these therapies modifies the activity of locally acting glomerular hormones, autocoids, suggesting that there is a component of proteinuria which is hormonally mediated. The effects of dietary protein, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors on nephrotic proteinuria and their potential hormonal mechanisms of action is the subject of this review.", 
    "301": "The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of fosinoprilat, the diacid of fosinopril sodium (a new angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor), were investigated in six haemodialysis patients. Intravenous 14C-fosinoprilat (7.5 mg), oral 14C-fosinopril sodium (10 mg) and oral fosinopril sodium (10 mg) were administered in an open-label, randomized study. Mean maximum concentration (Cmax), clearance (CL), volume of distribution at steady-state (Vss), mean residence time (MRTiv), and t1/2 values after IV administration of 14C-fosinoprilat were 2,042 micrograms.ml-1, 11.3 ml.min-1, 11.0 l, 16.3 h and 28.3 h, respectively. Following oral administration of 14C-fosinopril, mean Cmax, time to maximum plasma concentration (tmax), and fosinoprilat bioavailability values were 197 ng.ml-1, 5.2 h and 29.2%. Para-hydroxy fosinoprilat and fosinoprilat glucuronide comprised approximately 15% and 2% of radioactivity recovered in faeces. Four hours of haemodialysis only cleared approximately 1.5% of the administered dose. The maximum effect (Emax) model was fitted to the percentage inhibition of serum ACE activity vs. fosinoprilat concentration data in three patients. Emax ranged from 95.3 to 102.5%, and IC50 (the fosinoprilat concentration required to produce 50% of Emax) ranged from 2.6 to 4.2 ng.ml-1. Pharmacokinetic variables of the patients were similar to those in patients with moderate to severe renal dysfunction. Dosage modifications or supplemental dosing following dialysis are unnecessary.", 
    "302": "The renal effects of intravenous injection of 10 mg enalapril were investigated in 16 normotensive microalbuminuric type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetic patients. After enalapril the following changes were observed: fractional albumin clearance (theta Alb) decreased from 9.9 (3.0-23.8) to 8.2 (2.0-18.3) x 10(-6) (2 P < 0.01); filtration fraction (FF) decreased from 0.260 (0.225-0.312) to 0.253 (0.190-0.297) (2 P < 0.01); renal plasma flow (RPF) increased from 565 (411-690) to 623 (449-785) (2 P < 0.01); and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) remained stable at 149 (128-181) versus 150 (124-185) ml.min-1 (NS). These values were unchanged after placebo (n = 8), except for RFP which decreased from 606 (401-701) to 559 (381-677) ml.min-1 (2 P < 0.05) and GFR which was reduced from 148 (111-173) to 138 (111-167) (2 P < 0.05). A reduction in mean blood pressure from 94 (87-103) to 89 (79-101) mmHg (2 P < 0.05) was found in the enalapril group and a minor reduction in the placebo group from 97 (83-106) to 96 (81-104) mmHg (2 P < 0.05) was also noted. The relative changes in systolic blood pressure in the enalapril group correlated with changes in theta Alb (Spearman's r = 0.66, 2 P < 0.02) and FF (r = 0.53, 2 P < 0.05). Acute inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme does not reduce the pathological hyperfiltration in these patients and a reduction in theta Alb and FF can not be dissociated from the reduction in blood pressure.", 
    "303": "The search for the ideal antihypertensive drug is ongoing. Since hypertension initially is a relatively symptom-free disease, it is important that any agent developed be not only efficacious but also safe, with minimal side effects. Additionally such a drug should ideally possess both primary and secondary cardiovascular preventive properties. This review discusses the most commonly used antihypertensive drugs in the light of these goals, and highlights the development of multiaction drugs. Carvedilol, which is a nonselective beta-blocking and alpha 1-blocking drug, with additional Ca(2+)-antagonistic properties, is being developed as an antihypertensive, antianginal drug and as an adjunct therapy in congestive heart failure. The development challenges for this single-entity drug are discussed and evidence for its antihypertensive efficacy, as well as its antianginal efficacy, is presented. The cardioprotective potential of carvedilol based on preclinical experiments is addressed. Finally, the regulatory questions regarding the development of a multiaction drug are highlighted.", 
    "304": "Sustained oral treatment with beta blockers has been shown to improve symptoms in patients with chronic heart failure. In non-placebo-controlled trials, the administration initially of a low dose, gradually increased over a period of weeks has been demonstrated to improve both symptoms, exercise capacity and left-ventricular ejection fraction. The rationale for this treatment is the enhanced adrenergic stimulation present in heart failure which results in decreased sensitivity and density of myocardial beta-receptors. Beta blockers may decrease this pathological adrenergic drive. Carvedilol, in addition to its beta-blocking properties, is a vasodilator and is theoretically more suitable than earlier compounds of its potential to further decrease left-ventricular afterload. Recent studies have demonstrated symptomatic improvement with carvedilol in patients with heart failure, and a multicentre trial has been designed to evaluate its efficacy and safety.", 
    "305": "Verapamil is a calcium channel blocker widely used as an antihypertensive agent, and its pharmacological effects may partly be due to some degree of beta blockade. In order to evaluate the changes occurring in beta-2 adrenoceptor density, 40 patients with mild to moderate hypertension received verapamil 240 mg (once a day) or captopril 20 mg (twice a day) during 30 days, in a double-blind randomized study, after a placebo run-in period. The lymphocytic membrane beta-2 adrenoceptor density (Bmax) was determined before the administration of active drugs and after a 15-day treatment. After a month of treatment, most patients showed a marked reduction of their diastolic blood pressure: from 98.2 +/- 3.2 mmHg to 81.2 +/- 4.0 mmHg (p < 0.05), in the verapamil group, and from 95.0 +/- 6.0 mmHg to 82.5 +/- 4.8 mmHg (p < 0.05) in the captopril group. After 15 days of treatment, verapamil induced an up-regulation of beta-2 adrenoceptors from 39.5 +/- 8.3 fmol/mg protein to 58.5 +/- 12.0 fmol/mg protein (p < 0.05), whereas the Bmax in the captopril group did not significantly change. No significant change occurred in the two dissociation constants. This up-regulation phenomenon, common among beta-2 blockers, supports the hypothesis of verapamil's beta blockade potency.", 
    "306": "A previously published study reported on an open-label, multicenter study of the efficacy and tolerability of lovastatin in the management of nonfamilial primary hypercholesterolemia. In the present report the results from the 213 hypercholesterolemic patients with systemic hypertension are presented. At baseline mean +/- SD of total serum cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and the ratio of total serum cholesterol to HDL cholesterol were 268 +/- 24, 189 +/- 22 and 43 +/- 10 mg/dl and 6.6 +/- 1.6, respectively. Of the 213 hypertensive patients only 24 were not receiving antihypertensive or related cardiac medication. Baseline mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 140 +/- 20 and 84 +/- 9 mm Hg, respectively. Within 1 month of lovastatin therapy the observed significant reductions in total serum cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and the ratio of total to HDL cholesterol were 19, 27 and 24%, respectively. HDL cholesterol was increased by 6%. Diastolic blood pressure did not change significantly during this 1-month period. The 1-month lipid results were maintained over the full 6 months of the study. The dosage of lovastatin was 20 mg/day for the first month of therapy and could subsequently be adjusted to response, up to a maximum of 80 mg/day. Again, without changes in diastolic blood pressure, lovastatin was generally effective in improving the serum lipids of hypercholesterolemic hypertensive patients regardless of the type of antihypertensive medications received (including diuretics and beta blockers). Lovastatin was generally well tolerated.", 
    "307": "A clinical trial of 75 hypertensive subjects in stage II of the disease receiving ramipril monotherapy has established a marked efficacy of the above treatment. Individually adjusted single doses varied from 2.5 mg to 7.5 mg/day. The drug was well tolerated and had mild adverse effects (dry cough) in 2% of the patients. Long-term 12-week ramipril treatment in effective for hypertension doses is able to reduce myocardial mass without inhibition of the pumping capacity in the patients with left ventricular hypertrophy of the myocardium. In primary signs of nephroangiosclerosis hypertension correction was associated with improvement of filtration function and an increase in effective renal flow of plasma. The above pharmacodynamic effects make it possible to consider ramipril an effective hypotensive agent with organ-protective properties.", 
    "308": "Plasma concentration of two main cardiovascular substances - atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) and endothelin - were studied in control subjects (n = 21) under basal conditions and 90 minutes after oral administration of glucose. In hypertensive patients (n = 21) these determinations were repeated after 12 weeks treatment with an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril (Prinivil, Merck Sharp and Dohme). While basal and post-glucose ANF concentrations did not differ in controls and hypertensive patients, a tendency to the higher endothelin levels was found in our group of essential hypertension when compared to normotensive subjects. Glucose loading did not change significantly ANF concentrations in any studied group but significantly lowered plasma endothelin in both controls (from 13 +/- 0.95 to 9.50 +/- 0.95 fmol/ml) and hypertensive patients (from 15.05 +/- 1.23 to 12.15 +/- 1.03 fmol/min). Treatment of hypertensive patients with lisinopril paradoxically increased concentrations of ANF (from 6.43 +/- 2.53 to 11.47 +/- 4.90 fmol/ml) and lowered that of endothelin (from 15.05 +/- 1.23 to 12.17 +/- 1.58 fmol/ml). From our findings we may suggest that the relative predominance of the vasoconstrictor (endothelin) over the vasodilator (ANF) humoral substances might participate in pathogenesis of EH and that the reversal of this disadvantageous ratio after lisinopril (increase of ANF and decrease of endothelin) might contribute to the blood pressure reducing effect of ACEI. The drop in plasma endothelin after glucose remains so far unexplained consequence of glucose loading in both control and hypertensive subjects.", 
    "309": "Left ventricular dilation and dysfunction after myocardial infarction are major predictors of death. In experimental and clinical studies, long-term therapy with captopril, an angiotension-converting enzyme inhibitor, decreased ventricular dilation and rearrangement. This study was undertaken to examine whether captopril may reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with left ventricular dysfunction following myocardial infarction. On days 3 to 16 after myocardial infarction, 2231 patients with <40% ejection fraction, but without signs of obvious heart failure ot symptoms of myocardial ischemia were studied in a double-blind study, of them 1116 took placebo and 1115 had captopril. The follow-up averaged 42 months. The mortabity due to any causes was significantly lower in the captopril group (228 deaths or 20% than in the placebo group (275 deaths or 25%). The decrease in the risk was 19 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 3 to 32 percent; p = 0.019). The incidence of fatal and grave nonfatal cardiovascular events significantly decreased in captopril-treated patients. The risk decrease was 21 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 5 to 35 percent; p = 0.014) for cardiovascular mortality; 37 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 20 to 50 percent; p < 0.001) for the development of severe heart failure; 22 percent (95 percent confidence, 4 to 37 percent, p = 0.019) for congestive heart failure requiring hospitalization; 25 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 5 to 40 percent; p = 0.015) for recurrent myocardial infarction. Thus, long-term captopril use in patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction following prior myocardial infarction resulted in survival improvement and decreased morbidity and mortality due to severe cardiovascular events. There were positive results both in patients treated with thrombolytics, aspirin or <$Ebeta>-blockers and in those untreated with the above drugs. This suggests that the use of captopril additionally improved the therapeutic outcomes in patients with prior myocardial infection.", 
    "310": "A considerable number of hormones control renal perfusion to preserve glomerular filtration. We used the \"captopril test\" to characterize patients with renal-vascular hypertension. This study revealed a group of patients which reacted to 25 mg of captopril with a significant increase of plasma renin activity, but angiography excluded a renal artery stenosis. These patients had significantly more hypertensive organ damage than a control-group, including a significant microalbuminuria. Consequently, we infused a subpressure dose of angiotensin II to investigate its impact on albuminuria in these patients. Although angiotensin II induced hyperfiltration, microalbuminuria was not increased. Because this finding could have therapeutic relevance, we investigated the significance of different antihypertensive drugs (beta-blocker, alpha-blocker, Calcium antagonists, ACE-inhibitor) on microalbuminuria in patients with arterial hypertension. Renal hemodynamics were influenced as expected, but blood-pressure and microalbuminuria were reduced to the same extent by all antihypertensives. In contrast to these results, we could demonstrate significantly different influences of a beta-blocker and an ACE-inhibitor on proteinuria in patients with primary glomerulonephritis. These results suggest different effects of antihypertensive drugs on renal protein excretion depending on the actual disease.", 
    "311": "It is well documented that in the treatment of mild or moderate hypertension selective alpha 1-inhibitors such as doxazosin and prazosin lower blood pressure to approximately the same extent as beta-blockers, diuretics, ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists. However, treatment with selective alpha 1-inhibitors is also associated with a number of other favourable effects. For example, in contrast to most beta-blockers, selective alpha 1-inhibitors have a favourable effect on serum lipids, primarily lowering the triglycerides but also increasing the ratio of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol:total cholesterol. In addition, selective alpha 1-inhibitors do not aggravate glucose metabolism or increase uric acid concentration, as thiazide diuretics frequently do. Some patients gain particular benefit from treatment with a selective alpha 1-inhibitor, namely those with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and kidney failure. While no controlled mortality trials with selective alpha 1-inhibitors have yet been completed, new vasodilator drugs such as these do lower blood pressure in a more physiological manner than traditional antihypertensive agents, and appear to cause fewer side effects. In this respect, with the exception of patients with manifest or strongly suspected coronary heart disease who are not receiving beta-blocker treatment, selective alpha 1-inhibitors should be recommended as first-line agents for the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "312": "The influence of a 3-month antihypertensive treatment on cardiac structure and renal function was assessed in patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension randomly allocated to treatment by the nonselective beta-blocker tertatolol or the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril. Both tertatolol and enalapril treatments were associated with a similar decrease in mean arterial pressure (-26 +/- 6 and -15 +/- 2 mm Hg, respectively, both p < 0.05 in comparison with baseline values) and left ventricular mass (echocardiography: -48 +/- 17 vs. -18 +/- 6 g) but no change in glomerular filtration rate (DTPA clearance). Renal vascular resistance decreased similarly in both groups. Urinary albumin excretion was not significantly modified in either group. These results indicate that a consistent reduction in arterial pressure by either treatment was associated with a proportional change in left ventricular geometry and no alteration in renal function.", 
    "313": "The effects of cholinomimetic and non-cholinomimetic agents on spatial memory using a novel task in the 12-arm radial maze were investigated. The task was designed to reduce the tendency to use non-spatial strategies. Animals were repeatedly trained to retrieve food rewards from three arms, until a criterion level of performance was reached. Scopolamine (0.03 and 0.1 mg/kg SC), but not N-methylscopolamine (0.1 mg/kg SC) disrupted performance of this task. Physostigmine (0.3 mg/kg SC) and pilocarpine (30 mg/kg SC) completely reversed the deficit of performance produced by scopolamine. Furthermore, the ACE inhibitor Hoe 288 (10 nmol ICV) and the angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonist losartan (10 mg/kg SC) also significantly attenuated the scopolamine-induced deficit. These results show that this novel task in the radial maze is sensitive to the disruptive effects of scopolamine and can identify cognitive enhancing effects of both cholinomimetic and non-cholinomimetic drugs. Thus, this maze task provides a useful model for the evaluation of novel cognitive enhancing agents.", 
    "314": "The paper reviews the results of a preliminary study on hemodynamic and functional kidney indices in patients with hypertension with different etiopathogenesis. The investigation was carried out in 36 patients; 30 cases with no renal artery stenosis (RAS) and 6 cases with different stages of RAS. The investigation was conducted both in basal conditions and after the peroral administration of captopril (Zorcaptil \u00e0 25 mg, 1h before the examination). Kidney hemodynamics and its function were investigated by the dynamic kidney scintigraphy with the deconvolution analysis of the renogram and by the determination of the total and separate clearances 99Tcm-MAG3 and/or 99Tcm-DTPA. The obtained results lead to the conclusion that the sensitivity of the applied methodology enables differentiation of hypertensions in whose etiopathogenesis the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) does not play the key role. Further investigations are needed for valid conclusions to be made.", 
    "315": "Several studies have suggested that ACE-inhibition may be effective in postponing the onset of nephropathy in insulin-dependent diabetic subjects. In contrast, other drugs might have opposing effects. To study the long term effects of either captopril or nifedipine in normotensive, microalbuminuric patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, eighteen subjects received either placebo (n = 5, P), 20 mg nifedipine daily (n = 7, N) or 50 mg captopril daily (n = 6, C) for one year. Baseline clinical and laboratory variables were comparable in the three groups. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) and blood pressure did not differ between groups before and after one years medication. UAER did not change in the captopril and the placebo group (C: -12.6% (-58.1 to 51.8%)' P: -17.3 (-55.9 to 99.3%), medians and ranges. In contrast, in the patients that received nifedipine, UAER rose by 43.1% (-8.5 to 261.8%), (p < 0.05 Baseline vs one year, and one year nifedipine vs captopril and placebo). We therefore conclude, that long-term use of nifedipine increases UAER in normotensive microalbuminuric insulin-dependent subjects, in contrast to captopril or placebo. Whether this enhancement of microalbuminuria exerts an adverse effect on renal function in the long-term is yet unknown, but caution seems warranted.", 
    "316": "The practical objectives of a combination therapy are to obtain a better control of blood pressure (BP), and/or to improve tolerability through the use of lower doses of existing component. The prescription, in a single pill, of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and a calcium blocker has the theoretical and practical advantages of improving compliance by reducing the number of pills that have to be taken daily and the number of boxes the patient must carry. It also has a pharmacologic rationale mainly based on the buffering by ACE inhibitors of the calcium-blocker-induced stimulations of the renin-angiotensin system and the sympathetic nervous system, and on the reinforcement of the ACE inhibitors antihypertensive effect by the calcium-blocker-induced negative sodium balance. As an argument for such combinations, the neutralization of some dihydropyridines side effects, such as palpitations and edemas, must be addressed. The choice of each component dose is to provide a safe first-line indication and effective and flexible stepped-care treatment. It can only be the result of a complex development program, where BP effect measured at peak and at trough is investigated by the coherent utilization of parallel-group, cross-over, and factorial study designs. Safety studies in high-risk patients enrolled in special controlled trials are necessary.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "317": "We investigated whether dexamethasone pretreatment affected the acute increase in airway reactivity produced by high-level ozone exposure. Reactivity to intravenous IV substance P (SP), IV acetylcholine (ACh), or aerosolized capsaicin (CAP) before and 1 hr after ozone exposure (3 ppm for 2 hr) was determined by measuring specific airway resistance in anesthetized, spontaneously breathing guinea pigs, half of whom had been pretreated for 2 days pre-ozone with dexamethasone (2 mg/kg intramuscularly [IM] daily). The amount of IV SP, IV ACh, or inhaled capsaicin necessary to increase baseline specific airway resistance by 100% (ED200ACh or ED200SP) or 35% (ED135CAP) was determined by interpolation from dose-response curves. Compared to their pre-ozone status on the day of exposure, we found that dexamethasone-pretreated animals manifested significantly less of an increase in airway reactivity postozone to IV SP or inhaled CAP than did untreated animals. Changes in logEDs of the pretreated group were 0.18 +/- 0.03 (mean +/- SE) for SP and 2.20 +/- 0.11 for CAP compared to 0.27 +/- 0.04 and 3.38 +/- 0.34, respectively, for the untreated groups post-ozone (p < 0.05 and n = 4 for each). In contrast, dexamethasone pretreatment had no effect on IV ACh reactivity postozone: changes in logED200ACh were 0.27 +/- 0.08 and 0.28 +/- 0.04 for the pretreated and untreated groups, respectively (n = 4). In animals pretreated with captopril to block possible dexamethasone stimulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme synthesis that could influence tachykinin reactivity, we found that the corticosteroid effect on post-ozone SP reactivity was as marked as that seen in animals without captopril (n = 4). Because these reactivity studies were consistent with the possibility that dexamethasone may ameliorate ozone-induced, tachykinin hyperreactivity by stimulating airway neutral endopeptidase (NEP), we measured NEP activity by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) of each tracheal homogenate made from other groups of animals. Homogenates from ozone-exposed, dexamethasone-pretreated animals demonstrated significantly greater NEP activity (81 +/- 24%) than that from ozone-exposed, untreated animals (p < 0.05, n = 5). We conclude that corticosteroid pretreatment reduces the acute increase in airway reactivity to exogenous and endogenous tachykinins caused by ozone. This reduction may be at least partly due to stimulation of airway NEP activity, perhaps most of which is nonmucosal in that ozone acutely inactivates mucosal NEP.", 
    "318": "The effectiveness and tolerability of captopril and verapamil SR were compared in a double-blind, crossover study in 23 elderly hypertensives [15 males and 8 females, aged (mean +/- SEM) 68 +/- 1 years]. After 2 weeks of placebo run-in, patients were randomized to a starting dose of captopril, 12.5 mg b.i.d. or verapamil SR, 120 mg q.d. plus matched placebo of the opposite drug. Medication was titrated up over 6 weeks to a maximum dose of 75 mg of captopril or 360 mg of verapamil SR to achieve a sitting diastolic blood pressure of < 90 mm Hg. After 2 weeks of placebo washout, captopril and verapamil were crossed over. In the 20 patients who completed the study, the dose at the end of the respective treatment periods averaged 63 +/- 4 mg of captopril and 270 +/- 21 mg of verapamil SR. Blood pressure at the end of the run-in and washout placebo periods were comparable: 164 +/- 4/97 +/- 1 and 163 +/- 4/98 +/- 2 mm Hg, respectively. However, the blood pressure was significantly lower after verapamil, i.e., 147 +/- 4/86 +/- 2 mm Hg, than after captopril, i.e., 155 +/- 4/90 +/- 1 mm Hg (p < 0.05, ANOVA). There was no significant change in heart rate and laboratory parameters and no orthostatic hypotension. Captopril-treated patients reported a positive change in well being compared with placebo, although there was no overall difference between the drugs in any of the ten quality of life measurements. Three patients discontinued treatment, two because of constipation (verapamil) and one due to lack of efficacy (captopril).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "319": "The effects of two types of laboratory stressors, a structured interview and the cold pressor test, on blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were studied in normotensive individuals (n = 16), unmedicated hypertensive patients (n = 12), and medicated hypertensive patients (n = 46). Fifteen patients were in the bisoprolol group, 16 patients were in the enalapril group, and 15 patients were in the nitrendipine group. Concurrent physiologic measures, finger pulse volume (FPV), electrodermal activity, and respiratory frequency (RF), were also used to evaluate the level of stress reached by the subjects during and after the tasks. No significant differences were evident between the different treatments in BP and other physiologic responses to stressors. Patients receiving bisoprolol maintained lower HR and systolic BP values, but these differences were not related to the reaction to the stressors. No significant differences were noted in diastolic BP (DBP) between the different groups. The highest physiologic responses were obtained during the structured interview. Antihypertensive monotherapy does not attenuate cardiovascular reactions induced by acute stress in controlled laboratory conditions. In laboratory studies of the relationships between stress and hypertension, it is important that social stressors be used and that physiologic rather than cardiovascular measures of stress be recorded.", 
    "320": "The effects of enzyme inhibitors on vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-induced decreases in airway opening pressure (PaO) and VIP-like immunoreactivity (VIP-LI) recovery were studied in isolated tracheal superfused guinea pig lungs. In the absence of inhibitors, VIP 0.38 (95% CI 0.33-0.54) nmol/kg animal, resulted in a 50% decrease in PaO and 33% of a 1 nmol/kg VIP dose was recovered as intact VIP. In the presence of two combinations of enzyme inhibitors, SCH 32615 (S, 10 microM) and aprotinin (A, 500 tyrpsin inhibitor units [TIU]/kg) or S and soybean trypsin inhibitor (T, 500 TIU/kg), VIP caused a significantly greater decrease in PaO and greater quantities of VIP were recovered from lung effluent (both P < 0.001). The addition of captopril, (3 microM), leupeptin (4 microM), or bestatin (1 microM) failed to further increase pulmonary relaxation or recovery of VIP-LI. When given singly, A, T, and S did not augment the effects or recovery of VIP. The efficacy of S (a specific inhibitor of neutral endopeptidase [NEP]) and A and T (serine protease inhibitors) thus implicated NEP and at least one serine protease as primary modulators of VIP activity in the guinea pig lung. We sought to corroborate this finding by characterizing the predominant amino acid sites at which VIP is hydrolized in the lung. When [mono(125I)iodo-Tyr10]VIP was offered to the lung, in the presence and absence of the active inhibitors, cleavage products consistent with activity by NEP and a tryptic enzyme were recovered. These data demonstrate that NEP and a peptidase with an inhibitor profile and cleavage pattern compatible with a tryptic enzyme inactivate VIP in a physiologically competitive manner.", 
    "321": "The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of systemically or intracerebrally administered RA-octil, a derivative of the angiotensin converting enzyme (CE)-inhibitor ramipril, on memory and reinforcement and to compare its effectiveness with that of the neurokinin substance P (SP). In the first experiment systemic post-trial application of RA-octil and SP in the rat enhanced habituation, a learning task which does not require motivational treatments. Unlike SP, injection of RA-octil did not have reinforcing effects as measured with a conditioned place preference task. In the second experiment, a facilitation of inhibitory avoidance learning was obtained by injection of RA-octil or SP unilaterally into the basal forebrain immediately after the learning trial. In contrast, a 5 h delayed injection of RA-octil had no effects on learning. The results demonstrate memory-enhancing effects of RA-octil after systemic application as well as after injection into the basal forebrain. Furthermore, the mnemogenic effects of SP after central and peripheral administration were confirmed. Since RA-octil, although being structurally closely related to CE-inhibitors, does not affect plasma CE, yet exhibits mnemogenic effects, it is possible that \"cognition-enhancing\" actions of CE-inhibitors are dissociable from their action within the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "322": "Follow-up angiography at 6 months was obtained in 94% of the 693 patients (778 successfully dilated coronary lesions) enrolled in the Multicenter European Research trial with Cilazapril after Angioplasty to prevent Transluminal Coronary Obstruction and Restenosis (MERCATOR) trial--a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial--to study the effects of cilazapril 5 mg b.i.d. on restenosis [defined as the mean loss in minimal luminal diameter during follow-up, assessed by an interpolated edge detection technique (coronary angiography analysis system)] and long-term clinical outcome. No statistically significant difference could be detected between treatment and placebo groups with regard to clinical outcome or restenosis. The purpose of this ancillary study was to determine which, if any, patient, lesion, or procedural factors were predictive of restenosis. The identification of such factors could be helpful in the selection of lesions suitable for angioplasty and, if modifiable or controllable, potentially reduce restenosis. A stepwise multiple linear regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of restenosis. The following variables were retained in the model in order of significance: (a) relative gain (difference between the minimal luminal diameter pre- and post-percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), normalized for vessel size), (b) minimal luminal diameter post-PTCA, and (c) dilatation of another vessel than right coronary artery. The fit of the model was poor; where the predicted change in minimal luminal diameter was < 0.1 mm, 0.1-0.3 mm, > 0.3 mm, the corresponding percent correct classification was 30, 52, and 55%. The present study illustrates that the restenosis phenomenon cannot accurately be predicted by patient, lesion, and procedural variables.", 
    "323": "Cilazapril, a novel long-acting inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme, markedly suppressed the proliferative response and neointima formation after balloon catheter-induced injury of the carotid artery in a rat model of angioplasty. The reduction in neointima was dose-dependent, required sustained high levels of enzyme inhibition, and was significantly greater in animals treated starting 6 days prior to the procedure than in animals starting treatment the day of catheterization. In experiments with vascular smooth-muscle cells (SMC) in culture, the addition of angiotensin II reduces increased mRNA levels for several growth factors and extracellular matrix proteins. Here we report that Ang II selectively induces mRNA for thrombospondin I, but not for thrombospondin II. Under selected conditions SMC can be induced to proliferate after exposure to Ang II, in vitro and in vivo. Using neutralizing anti transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) antibodies we found that Ang II stimulation of proliferation was threefold greater when the anti-TGF-beta was added to the cultures. We suggest (a) that an important effect of Ang II during the proliferative response is the induction of thrombospondin I, which is required for matrix interactions during the formation of neointima, and (b) that, among the complex array of growth factors potentially active in vivo, TGF-beta may be an important negative regulatory factor that limits the proliferative response and prevents restenosis in most cases of angioplasty.", 
    "324": "Both the function and the morphology of the vascular intima are altered during hypertension. In spontaneously hypertensive rats, endothelium-dependent relaxation is decreased, and the subendothelium becomes infiltrated with monocyte macrophages. It is not known if these two features are secondary to high blood pressure and what their consequences are; however, both can be reversed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. The present paper summarizes the effects of a chronic treatment with the ACE inhibitor cilazapril on endothelial function and subendothelial morphology in spontaneously hypertensive rats.", 
    "325": "Key discoveries in the past decade have revealed that the vascular endothelium is an important regulatory organ that is involved in maintaining cardiovascular homeostasis in health and contributes significantly to the pathomechanism of several cardiovascular diseases. Occupying a strategically important location between circulating blood and tissues and having the ability to respond to changes in its physical, chemical, and humoral environment by the production of a host of biologically active substances, the normal endothelium modulates the tone of underlying vascular smooth muscle, maintains a nonadhesive luminal surface, and mediates hemostasis, cellular proliferation, and inflammatory and immune mechanisms in the vascular wall. Modulation of smooth-muscle tone is mediated by the synthesis release of endothelium-derived relaxing [PGI2, EDRF(NO), and EDHF] and contracting factors (arachidonic acid metabolites, endothelin-1, and angiotensin II). Anticoagulant, fibrinolytic, and antithrombotic properties contribute to the maintenance of the fluidity of blood. Injury or activation (by cytokines) of endothelial cells disrupts these normal regulatory mechanisms and results in morphologic and functional alterations (phenotypic changes) commonly defined as endothelial dysfunction. Clinically, the \"syndrome\" of endothelial cell dysfunction can be described as generalized or localized vasospasm, thrombosis, atherosclerosis, and restenosis. Although its importance is clearly established, no drugs used today were originally targeted for the treatment of endothelial dysfunction. Recent studies, however, showed that some existing therapies (e.g., angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) may protect the endothelium. Novel diagnostic techniques and innovative therapeutic strategies, based on the already known molecular mechanisms of endothelial dysfunction, are briefly outlined. Further knowledge of the pathobiology of the impaired endothelium will contribute to unraveling some of the remaining mysteries of many cardiovascular diseases and will enable us to design novel therapies to prevent and treat them.", 
    "326": "The efficacy and toleration of once-daily amlodipine (5-10 mg o.d.) and captopril (25-50 mg b.i.d.) were compared in 45 patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was performed at baseline and at the end of the 8-week study period. Clinic blood pressure, heart rate, and adverse events were assessed during a placebo run-in and after 2, 4, and 8 weeks of treatment. Both amlodipine and captopril significantly reduced clinic blood pressure without affecting heart rate. Between-treatment comparisons showed that amlodipine produced a significantly greater reduction in sitting diastolic blood pressure than captopril. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring revealed a sustained reduction in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure throughout a full 24-h period in patients taking amlodipine. In contrast, however, the effects of captopril were no longer evident during the final 3 h of the dosing interval. Both drugs were generally well tolerated, and the incidence of adverse events was similar in each group. This study demonstrates that amlodipine is more effective as a once-daily antihypertensive agent than captopril administered twice daily.", 
    "327": "Amlodipine (5-10 mg, once daily) and enalapril (10-40 mg, once daily) were compared in terms of quality of life, efficacy, and tolerability, in a multicenter, double-blind trial lasting for 50 weeks in 461 mild or moderate hypertensive patients. Both drugs were similarly effective in lowering blood pressure while maintaining quality of life. Apart from class-typical effects, such as edema for calcium antagonists, and cough for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, both drugs were equally well tolerated, with few adverse effects of clinical significance. Only a few patients [eight amlodipine (4%); nine enalapril (4%)] were withdrawn from the trial due to drug-related adverse events, demonstrating that tolerability was good. Neutral to slightly beneficial effects were found in blood lipid concentrations after treatment with amlodipine. Both drugs reduced the calculated risk of coronary heart disease over the next 10 years. It was concluded that amlodipine compared favorably with enalapril as an effective and well-tolerated antihypertensive drug.", 
    "328": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been extensively studied and established in the treatment of hypertension, heart failure, and ventricular dysfunction. They have various cardiac and vascular protective effects, but the relevant mechanisms of action in these areas remain to be fully understood. Possible effects of converting-enzyme inhibition related to maintenance of normal endothelial function and inhibition of atherosclerosis should be distinguished from effects on myointimal proliferation related to vascular injury and regression of vascular hypertrophy from blood pressure reduction. Experimental animal studies have showed benefit from converting-enzyme inhibition in preventing myointimal proliferation after vascular injury in some species, but no such effect has been shown in clinical studies of restenosis following coronary angioplasty. Laboratory studies have demonstrated a protective effect of converting-enzyme inhibition on endothelial vasomotor function. Further studies have demonstrated prevention of atherosclerosis in hyperlipidemic rabbits and cholesterol-fed cynomolgus monkeys. Possible mechanisms of action apart from blood pressure lowering include inhibition of angiotensin II and other tissue growth factors and accumulation of kinins. These data, among others, provide sufficient rationale for clinical studies to determine whether converting-enzyme inhibitors can reduce atherosclerotic disease and thus widen their application as cardiac and vascular protective agents.", 
    "329": "Thirteen patients with chronic congestive heart failure of NYHA class II-III received multiple doses (14 days) of ramipril (5 mg once daily); the concentrations of ramipril and ramiprilat in plasma, as well as ramipril, ramiprilat, glucuronides, diketopiperazine, and diketopiperazine acid in urine were measured at various times for 14 days. One patient dropped out after the first day due to hypotension and another who accidentally received another ACE inhibitor additionally was excluded, so that 11 patients completed the study. Ramipril and ramiprilat in plasma were determined by radioimmunoassay, and ramipril and its metabolites in urine were measured by gas chromatography in the laboratories of Hoechst AG. Peak concentrations of the active substance ramiprilat were reached after about 4 h and amounted to 22.3 +/- 11.1 ng/ml after the first dose, and a peak concentration of 26.6 +/- 10.0 ng/ml was observed 2.5 +/- 1.4 h on average after administration on day 14. Practically no accumulation was observed for ramiprilat; the AUD (0-24 h) values increased from 191.3 +/- 83.1 ng.h/ml for the first study day to 238.3 +/- 98.0 ng.h/ml for day 14. As expected, only very small fractions of the dose were excreted with urine as unchanged ramipril and ramipril glucuronide. Ramiprilat is excreted with urine to a larger extent than is rampiril--on average 6.6 +/- 3.0% on the first day and 12.2 +/- 3.8% on day 14. The total amount excreted increased by 34% on average, and was mainly due to an increased ramiprilat excretion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "330": "Over 13,000 patients have been randomized in 35 long-term trials of the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in patients with heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction. Overall, there is a clear reduction in mortality and hospitalizations for heart failure and myocardial infarction with a trend toward fewer sudden deaths. Furthermore, there is a significant reduction in myocardial infarction in three of the larger trials. These benefits have been demonstrated with several different agents and are consistently seen in various subgroups of patients defined by symptomatic status, etiology of left ventricular dysfunction, age, and gender. However, benefits were greatest among patients with the lowest ejection fraction. In conclusion, ACE inhibitors are of established value in patients with heart failure and/or left ventricular dysfunction.", 
    "331": "The AIRE study--a trial involving over 2,000 patients with clinical heart failure after myocardial infarction--assessed different outcomes. The primary outcome was total mortality. The secondary outcome was time to death, or progression to severe/resistant heart failure, reinfarction or stroke. Tertiary analyses included hospitalization and mode of death. To obtain maximum quality in the validation of outcomes and to optimize the quality of the data in the study, an end-points committee reviewed all data following preset definitions prior to code break. All definitions used are reported here. Experience of the validation process demonstrated that there are wide variations in clinical practice and terminology not only among countries but also among individual investigators. Variation in the clinical handling and treatment of patients makes it imperative to validate outcomes centrally on the basis of available facts.", 
    "332": "There is justifiable enthusiasm for the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in patients with heart failure. However, early after an acute myocardial infarction, the benefits (or harm) from use of these agents in individual patients may depend on the critical balance between the ischemic problem (the extent of coronary artery narrowing and risk of vessel occlusion) against the need to preserve remaining ventricular function. Patients who are hemodynamically stable without ongoing chest pain but with significantly impaired ventricular function seem likely to gain most from treatment with ACE inhibitors. Extrapolation to the acute infarct situation from the recently published trials in chronic stable heart failure may mislead, and the findings of a number of large ongoing mortality trials in patients with recent myocardial infarction are awaited.", 
    "333": "The objectives of exercise testing in congestive heart failure (CHF) may be summarized as follows: (a) detect impaired cardiac performance, (b) grade severity of cardiac failure and classify functional capability, and (c) assess effects of interventions. Several different methods are available to make these assessments, and we have to ask ourselves how well exercise testing achieves these objectives. It has to be kept in mind that the power generated by the exercising muscles is dependent on the oxygen delivery to the skeletal muscles. Oxygen uptake is the result of an integrated performance of the lungs, heart, and peripheral circulation. In patients, as well as in normal subjects, oxygen uptake is related to hemodynamic indices such as cardiac output, stroke volume, or exercise duration when a stepwise regulated maximal exercise protocol is used. However, there are major differences in the concept of a true maximum in normal subjects versus heart failure patients. Fit-normal subjects will achieve a real maximal oxygen uptake, whereas patients may stop testing before a maximum is reached because of symptoms such as dyspnea or leg fatigue. Therefore, it is better if the actual oxygen uptake can be measured. \"Peak\" rather than true maximal oxygen uptake has been suggested for the classification of the severity of heart failure. Peripheral factors modify the cardiac output through such factors as vascular resistance, organ function, and hormonal release. Maximal exercise will stress the cardiovascular system to a point where the weakest chain will impose a limiting effect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "334": "From pharmacologic investigations and clinical studies it is known that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors exhibit additional local actions, which are not related to hemodynamic changes and which cannot be explained simply by interference with the renin-angiotensin system with subsequent inhibition of angiotensin II formation. Because ACE is identical to kininase II, which inactivates the nonapeptide bradykinin (BK), potentiation of BK might be responsible for these additional effects of ACE inhibitors. To prove the specificity of BK-mediated effects by ACE inhibition, we used the specific B2 kinin receptor antagonist HOE 140 in different models: endothelial cell cultures; atherosclerosis in high-cholesterol-fed rabbits; neointima formation with smooth cell proliferation and migration after endothelial denudation in rats; myocardial ischemia in rats, rabbits, and dogs; and left ventricular hypertrophy in rats. The beneficial effects of ramipril or BK given in non-blood pressure-lowering doses in these models were abolished by HOE 140 (icatibant). Ramipril exerts cardioprotective effects in different experimental models. The formation of the endothelial autacoids nitric oxide and prostacyclin, enhanced when BK degradation is inhibited by ACE inhibition, may contribute to the observed beneficial effects.", 
    "335": "It is well known that, in patients with essential hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. However, it has been demonstrated that normalisation of arterial pressure, by therapy with antihypertensive drugs, is associated with regression of LVH, although the extent and time-course of this phenomenon depend on the antihypertensive drug used. In particular, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors seem capable of inducing a faster and more complete reversal of LVH in patients with essential hypertension than other antihypertensive drugs. The mechanisms underlying this property of ACE inhibitors remain unclear, although 2 features of ACE inhibitors may be particularly relevant. The first is their ability to improve large artery compliance, this being a major determinant of LVH. Arterial compliance is reduced in essential hypertension, resulting in increased left ventricular end-systolic stress, which then contributes to the development of LVH. The second possible mechanism by which ACE inhibitors reverse LVH to a greater degree than other antihypertensive drugs may relate to their ability to interfere with the cardiopulmonary receptor control of the circulation. Thus, ACE inhibitors may counteract the neural and hormonal abnormalities that contribute to the maintenance of LVH in hypertensive patients.", 
    "336": "Alterations in the structure and function of large arteries could be a major factor in the mortality and morbidity of hypertensive patients. This paper summarises the effects of various pharmacological treatments on the mechanical (functional) properties of large arterial walls and on the structure and composition of these vessels. Firstly, during arterial hypertension, increases in arterial stiffness, associated with medial hypertrophy and/or hyperplasia and alterations in extracellular matrix, are always observed. Sodium intake and aging may influence the arterial wall properties, causing an increase in stiffness, independently of their effect on blood pressure. In parallel, administration of low doses of diuretics to hypertensive rats did not cause significant haemodynamic changes, but did cause an increase in arterial distensibility. Nitrates and derivatives have specific effects on the smooth muscle from large arteries in hypertensive patients. Significant increases in the diameter of large arteries and in arterial wall stiffness have been reported in clinical studies, but these effects have a short time constant. In humans and animals, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and calcium antagonists cause relaxation of arterial smooth muscle and, therefore, improve the functional component of the reduced distensibility observed in hypertension. Long term treatment with ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists induces a significant reduction in medial hypertrophy. However, it is difficult to distinguish between the direct effects resulting from pressure reduction and a specific drug effect.", 
    "337": "Abnormalities in left ventricular (LV) diastolic function in the presence of normal LV systolic performance is one of the earliest cardiac manifestations of systemic hypertension. Alterations in diastolic filling indices have been observed more clearly in patients with LV hypertrophy, although it is evident that these filling abnormalities may be significantly influenced by age, bodyweight, blood pressure, left atrial size, LV systolic function, interstitial fibrosis, impaired coronary blood flow, and sympathetic stimulation. Several studies indicate that abnormal diastolic function may be responsible, at least in part, for an impaired LV systolic response to isotonic or isometric exercise, even when systolic performance is normal at rest. Short and long term administration of some antihypertensive drugs, such as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and calcium antagonists, particularly of the phenylalkylamine type, may significantly improve diastolic function. We observed that abnormal diastolic filling was significantly improved when LV mass was reduced by long term antihypertensive therapy. Even when treatment was withdrawn and blood pressure had increased again, LV mass remained reduced. These results suggest that regression of LV mass might improve LV diastolic function per se. Further studies are needed to assess the effect of improvement of LV diastolic function on the long term prognosis of patients with hypertension.", 
    "338": "Numerous intervention studies have clearly demonstrated the value of antihypertensive treatment. By lowering diastolic blood pressure 5 to 6mm Hg in middle-aged hypertensive patients, a 42% reduction in stroke morbidity and a 14% reduction in coronary heart disease morbidity can be obtained. Recently published large intervention trials have shown that antihypertensive treatment provides even greater benefits in elderly hypertensive patients. Not only are cardiovascular morbidity and mortality reduced, but, in the 'old elderly', total mortality is reduced when blood pressure is lowered. It is conceivable that even better outcomes will be achieved with newer antihypertensive therapies, such as calcium antagonists and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and this possibility is being investigated in large prospective intervention trials.", 
    "339": "In most cases of renal disease, progression of renal failure occurs via nonspecific mechanisms that can be dissociated from the primary cause of renal damage. Progression of disease is accompanied by glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Loss of autoregulation and afferent renal vasodilation renders the glomerular microcirculation particularly susceptible to systemic hypertension. Glomerular growth is an ancillary factor permitting the development of glomerulosclerosis. Experimental and clinical studies indicate that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may prevent progressive renal deterioration. Furthermore, it appears that this effect can be dissociated, at least in part, from the haemodynamic effects of ACE inhibitors. Some evidence indicates that the renal-protective effects of ACE inhibitors results from their effects on glomerular growth and glomerular permselectivity. The role of reduced generation of angiotensin II or accumulation of kinins in the renal effects of ACE inhibitors is under investigation. Prospective clinical trials have demonstrated that ACE inhibitors reduce proteinuria and interfere with progression of renal disease to a greater degree than can be explained by their blood pressure lowering effects alone.", 
    "340": "Among the physicochemical, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties that differentiate trandolapril from other angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, the most clinically relevant ones are those that contribute to the long duration of action of the drug. The long elimination half-life of trandolapril and its strong lipophilicity, high ACE inhibitor potency and high affinity for the ACE cause the drug to have a long biological half-life. The long duration of action of trandolapril may be demonstrated experimentally; near total ACE inhibition is observed 24 hours after single dose administration and there is significant ACE inhibition 72 hours following drug withdrawal after long term therapy. We have analysed the duration of blood pressure lowering during long term therapy with commercially available ACE inhibitors in published studies using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. On the basis of results from 19 studies undertaken in patients with mild to moderate hypertension, it was possible to reconstruct the curve of the magnitude of blood pressure changes against time. Mean trough: peak ratio calculations showed that once-daily administration produced ratios higher than 50% with enalapril (40 to 80%), lisinopril (40 to 70%) and trandolapril (50 to 100%). Other ACE inhibitors had trough: peak ratios lower than 50%. Despite many methodological limitations, this literature analysis demonstrates that trandolapril has a blood pressure-lowering effect for the full 24-hour period. Studies in which a dose is occasionally omitted show that the blood pressure-lowering effect of trandolapril may last beyond 24 hours.", 
    "341": "Some antihypertensive drugs adversely affect the plasma lipid profile, and this has to be taken into account when choosing treatment for hypertension because it may offset the beneficial blood pressure-lowering effect of these agents. In this study, the long term effects of verapamil sustained release (SR) 240mg daily and enalapril 20mg daily on plasma lipid levels were investigated in 931 patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Patients whose blood pressure was not effectively lowered after at least 1 month of monotherapy had either enalapril 20mg once daily added to their verapamil treatment or hydrochlorothiazide 12.5mg once daily added to their enalapril treatment. Blood pressure and lipid profile were assessed before and after 6 months of treatment. Of 864 evaluable patients, 563 patients (65.1%) were successfully treated with monotherapy and 220 patients (25.5%) required combination therapy. A total of 81 patients withdrew from the trial. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were significantly reduced by treatment with either verapamil or enalapril, and heart rate was reduced slightly, but significantly, by both treatments. Total cholesterol, triglycerides and low density lipoprotein were significantly reduced by both treatments. High density lipoprotein levels were significantly increased in verapamil recipients, but not in enalapril recipients. Adverse effects occurred in 37 (3.9%) patients receiving verapamil SR and 25 (2.7%) patients receiving enalapril. In conclusion, long term treatment with the antihypertensive agents verapamil and enalapril, alone or in combination regimens, significantly improved the plasma lipid profile. Verapamil SR had the most beneficial effect on plasma lipid levels.", 
    "342": "Theoretically, it should be possible to match the requirements of individual patients with the pharmacological and clinical properties of the large number of antihypertensive drugs now available. The concept of automatic sequential stepped-care therapy is now largely outdated, but therapy of clinically important hypertension must be initiated with one agent. Diuretics remain a first-line option in the elderly and in Black patients, as do calcium antagonists. Outcome trials are available only for the elderly, and in these the benefits of initial diuretic therapy are well documented. Nonetheless, diuretics may often need to be co-prescribed with a beta-blocker or an adrenergic modifier such as methyldopa. beta-Blockers are preferred in patients with ischaemic heart disease or enhanced adrenergic drive, while alpha-blockers are preferred in patients with blood lipid abnormalities or prostatic problems. Calcium antagonists or angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are being increasingly used as initial therapy when quality of life is important and metabolic neutrality is required. Calcium antagonists are more likely to be effective first-line therapy than ACE inhibitors in patients with a high salt intake, in patients with Raynaud's disease, when angina pectoris is present, and in Black patients. ACE inhibitors are preferred for combination with diuretic agents, and in the presence of congestive heart failure or low salt intake. Experimentally, both calcium antagonists and ACE inhibitors can prevent ischaemic ventricular fibrillation and atheroma. Combination therapy between these 2 drug classes is gaining increasing acceptance because of these theoretical advantages.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "343": "Results from many studies suggest that the central nervous system may play an important role in enhancing and maintaining sympathetic, metabolic and haemodynamic effects in patients with hypertension. Likewise, emotional and mental stresses may provoke phasic and sustained adrenergic responses in normotensive and untreated hypertensive patients. Because the various antihypertensive medications have different mechanisms of action, and elicit different neurovegetative responses, it is useful to distinguish between the effects of different treatments on sympathetic activity. To identify the effect of stress on sympathetic reactivity, we evaluated the extracardiovascular and haemodynamic responses to various stressor agents using noninvasive techniques. This psychophysiological approach allowed us to standardise stress, to identify individual cardioneurovegetative responses both before and during treatment, and to establish the effects of various treatments on the cardioneurovegetative response. The extracardiovascular psychophysiological response of patients with a family history of hypertension and of normotensive patients who later became hypertensive was characterised by an inability to recover after mental challenge. Therefore, prolonged sympathetic activity resulting from mental stimulation may contribute to the development of hypertension. Antihypertensive medications affected sympathetic reactivity differently. For example, nifedipine worsened sympathetic reactivity, while verapamil was able to correct abnormal neuroadrenergic responses. Furthermore, verapamil was successfully combined with enalapril in patients whose hypertension was resistant to monotherapy with the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Therefore, the functional and structural consequences of sympathetic stimulation resulting from daily activation and pharmacological blood pressure adjustments are important in hypertensive patients, because they may have abnormal sympathetic reactivity to various stimuli.", 
    "344": "The effects of cardiovascular drugs on endothelium and vascular smooth muscle function are important for the prevention of cardiovascular disease. Changes in endothelial function are an early event in most forms of cardiovascular disease and, later in the disease process, vascular smooth muscle cells are functionally altered and begin to migrate to and proliferate in the intima. Calcium antagonists and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are widely used in patients with cardiovascular disease and are thought to have vascular protective effects. ACE, an enzyme located in the endothelial cell membrane, activates angiotensin I and angiotensin II, and deactivates bradykinin. Bradykinin activates endothelial bradykinin (B2) receptors, which results in the formation of nitric oxide and prostacyclin. Hence, ACE inhibitors not only prevent the formation of angiotensin II, but also increase the local levels of bradykinin and in turn nitric oxide and prostacyclin. These compounds are vasodilators and potent inhibitors of platelet function, and therefore may mediate important protective effects of ACE inhibitors. Furthermore, nitric oxide may have antiproliferative effects in vascular smooth muscle cells. Calcium antagonists do not appear to affect the release of endothelium-derived relaxing factors or any other endothelial product. However, they facilitate endothelium-dependent relaxation and reduce the contracting effects of endothelin-1 at the level of smooth muscle. Indeed, in some blood vessels, e.g. the large coronary arteries and the human forearm circulation, verapamil and nifedipine antagonise endothelin-induced contractions. In addition, calcium antagonists inhibit the effects of platelet-derived growth factor and may have antiproliferative effects in vascular smooth muscle cells. In conditions involving progressive dysfunction of the endothelium, vascular deposition of platelets increases the local levels of platelet-derived growth factor, and the antiproliferative effects of calcium antagonists may thus be particularly important.", 
    "345": "Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a powerful renal vasoconstrictor peptide that could be implicated in acute renal failure. The aim of this study was to test the effects of the endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE) inhibitor phosphoramidon on pressor responses to ET-1 and its precursor, big ET-1, in isolated perfused rat kidneys and in pithed rats. In Tyrode-perfused rat kidneys, both big ET-1 (0.2-0.4 nmol) and ET-1 (0.01-0.03 nmol) evoked dose-dependent constrictions. Phosphoramidon (10 microM) selectively inhibited the pressor responses to big ET-1 without altering those to ET-1, norepinephrine, angiotensin I (AT-I), or angiotensin II (AT-II). The metalloprotease inhibitor thiorphan, but not the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor perindoprilate, also selectively inhibited the renal constrictions caused by big ET-1 but not those induced by ET-1. In vivo, both big ET-1 and ET-1 (0.5-2 nmol/kg) evoked pressor responses that were augmented by indomethacin (15 mg/kg) and L-NNA (1 mg/kg/min). Phosphoramidon selectively inhibited the pressor responses to big ET-1 (ID50: 78 micrograms/kg/min) without affecting those to ET-1, AT-I, or AT-II. These data illustrate that the pressor responses to big ET-1 in the rat, both in vivo and in vitro, are due to its conversion into ET-1 by a phosphoramidon-sensitive ECE. In the rat, phosphoramidon selectively inhibits ECE but not ACE both in vitro and in vivo.", 
    "346": "Several drugs used for antihypertensive therapy may modify the lipoprotein metabolism. Thiazides in high dosage and loop diuretics can increase serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and/or very-LDL cholesterol and the total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ratio, while HDL cholesterol is largely unchanged; triglycerides (Tg) are also often elevated. Premenopausal women may be protected from this side effect. Whether diuretic-induced dyslipidemia is dose-dependent and low thiazide doses (i.e., hydrochlorothiazide < or = 12.5 mg daily) are interacting less, awaits clarification. beta-Blockers without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity increase serum triglycerides and tend to lower the potentially antiatherogenic HDL cholesterol. The diuretic-antihypertensive agent indapamide, given at a dose of 2.5 mg/day, is neutral with regard to serum lipoprotein and glucose metabolism. The potassium-sparing diuretic spironolactone, conventional sympatholytic agents, calcium-channel blockers, and probably the serotonin2-receptor antagonist ketanserin, exert no relevant effects on the lipoprotein profile. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may slightly decrease serum triglycerides. alpha 1-Receptor blockers slightly decrease LDL cholesterol and Tg and increase HDL cholesterol. Drug-induced development or aggravation of dyslipidemia represents a potentially adverse influence. In the hypertensive population, effective blood pressure control with traditional drug therapy based on thiazide-type diuretics in high dosage led to a distinct decrease in cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality, but failed to satisfactorily reduce coronary complications. The prognostic relevance of drug-induced changes in serum lipoproteins, carbohydrate metabolism and other risk factors or correlates awaits further clarification.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "347": "Epidemiologic studies suggest a close association between hypertension, obesity, and diabetes. It has been demonstrated that essential hypertension, per se, is an insulin-resistant state. However, the pathogenesis of the association between insulin resistance and hypertension is poorly understood. Elevated plasma insulin levels may contribute to the development of hypertension through renal sodium reabsorption, the sympathetic nervous system, the transmembranous cation transport, the renin-angiotensin system, the cardiovascular reactivity, and the atrial natriuretic peptide. Diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium antagonists, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and alpha 1-antagonists are first-choice drugs in the management of hypertension. Diuretics, except indapamide, impair insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance. The same negative effects, exerted by beta-blockers, are reduced employing those with selective activity. With few exceptions, calcium antagonists have no adverse influence on carbohydrate metabolism. ACE inhibitors and alpha 1-antagonists do not influence or even improve glucose metabolism.", 
    "348": "Our aim was to assess the effect of blood pressure treatment on albumin excretion rate (AER) in diabetic patients using two antihypertensive agents with different modes of action: indapamide and captopril. Patients with persistent microalbuminuria on two occasions (AER 20-200 micrograms/min) entered a randomized crossover study of 12 weeks of therapy with a constant dose of either indapamide 2.5 mg daily or captopril 12.5 mg three times daily, with a 4-week washout between therapy periods. Blood pressure was measured using a random-zero sphygmomanometer and AER by radioimmunoassay on a timed urine collection. Results (mean +/- standard deviation) were analyzed by repeated measures of analysis of variance after log transformation of AER data. Twelve patients [nine men; mean age 58 +/- 7.5 years (range 49-73 years), all with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM)] were studied. Both blood pressure [initial mean systolic 144 +/- 14 mm Hg (range 124-166)/initial mean diastolic 85 +/- 6 mm Hg (range 75-96)] and AER [initial 92 +/- 36 micrograms/min (range 36-161)] were significantly reduced below basal levels (at the 0.05 level) at all study intervals by both antihypertensive agents. The results show the importance of blood pressure and its treatment on AER in patients with NIDDM. In this study, indapamide was as effective as an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor in reducing both blood pressure and microalbuminuria.", 
    "349": "The effect of 6 months of treatment with indapamide (IND, 2.5 mg/day) on regression of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), an independent predictor of poor prognosis in hypertension, was compared by echocardiography to that of nifedipine (NFD, 40 mg/day), enalapril (ENL, 20 mg/day), atenolol (ATL, 100 mg/day), and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ, 25 mg/day) in four parallel double-blind studies in 151 hypertensive patients with a diastolic blood pressure between 95 and 120 mm Hg and a raised left ventricular mass index (LVMI) (mg/m2) (Devereux). Patients were randomized to IND or comparator following a 2-week washout (1 month in the IND vs. ATL study). Respective baseline and 6-month LVMI values (mg/m2) were: IND (n = 20) vs. HCTZ (n = 20): 151.4 +/- 6.3 and 125.70 +/- 4.6 (p < 0.001) vs. 141.3 +/- 6.6 and 135.6 +/- 8.3 (p = N.S.); IND (n = 22) vs NFD (n = 19): 144.1 +/- 5.3 and 125.1 +/- 4.3 (p < 0.001) vs. 170.4 +/- 6.6 and 148.2 +/- 6.2 (p < 0.001); IND (n = 9) vs. ENL (n = 9): 155.1 +/- 6.3 and 143.4 +/- 5.2 (p < 0.001) vs. 142.0 +/- 6.7 and 130.0 +/- 5.9 (p < 0.001); IND (n = 17) vs. ATL (n = 12): 146.2 +/- 5.1 and 130.8 +/- 6.5 (p < 0.001) vs. 156.7 +/- 8.4 and 142.9 +/- 10.3 (p < 0.01). All drugs significantly reduced diastolic blood pressure, and all except HCTZ induced a significant and similar reduction in left ventricular mass.", 
    "350": "Diuretics have been used to treat hypertension since 1958. The doses used were relatively high. Dose-dependent side effects and the increasing availability of other drugs such as beta- and alpha-blockers, calcium-entry blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, with equal antihypertensive efficacy but additional effects in cardiovascular diseases, led to a decrease in diuretic use. In controlled trials, little or no protection against coronary artery disease (CAD) was discussed as being due to the diuretics' side effects. The main side effects are hypokalemia, hyperglycemia, and hyperlipidemia. Hypokalemia occurs most often (up to 30%) in thiazide-treated hypertensive patients, and may cause arrhythmias in patients with CAD. This side effect is clearly dose-dependent and may be avoided by comedication with antikaliuretics. Glucose intolerance may develop in about 3% of diuretic-treated men and is reversible after discontinuation of the diuretic. This side effect is functionally correlated with hypokalemia and therefore is not seen when patients are given a comedication (for example, spironolactone prevents hypokalemia). Hypercholesterolemia was first reported in 1964 during long-term diuretic treatment. During the first 12 weeks of treatment, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol increased 5-15% in men and postmenopausal women. After 1 year of therapy, the levels decreased to pretreatment values. However, in placebo-controlled trials, the placebo groups exhibited cholesterol levels falling below the diuretic group. Although the mechanisms and the clinical implications of these side effects are not completely understood, the perception grew that diuretics per se may have been at least partially responsible for the lack of protection against CAD.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "351": "The effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on endothelial autacoid formation were determined in human cultured endothelial cells and in endothelium-intact bovine coronary arteries under resting conditions and after stimulation with bradykinin. Incubation of cultured human endothelial cells with moexiprilat or ramiprilat (0.3 microM) caused a maintained increase in resting intracellular calcium [Ca2+]i, which was prevented by the selective B2-receptor antagonist Hoe 140 (0.1 microM). Both ACE inhibitors also significantly enhanced the increase in [Ca2+]i elicited by bradykinin (3 nM). In parallel with their effect on resting [Ca2+]i, moexiprilat and ramiprilat both induced an increase in intracellular cyclic GMP (cGMP). This increase was prevented by Hoe 140 (0.1 microM) and was abolished by NG-nitro-L-arginine (30 microM), indicating a kinin-induced nitric oxide (NO) formation in this response. The elevation in [Ca2+]i also led to an enhanced production of prostacyclin (PGI2), as indicated by an increase in the concentration of 6-keto prostaglandin F1 alpha (PGF1 alpha) in the cell supernatant. Similar effects of the ACE inhibitors on endothelial autacoid production were observed in endothelium-intact bovine coronary arteries. Like bradykinin (30 nM), moexiprilat (0.3 microM) elicited a nearly twofold increase in the cGMP content of these arteries, which was abolished by both NG-nitro-L-arginine and removal of the endothelium. The functional consequences of this ACE inhibitor-induced increase in vascular cGMP were reflected by a distinct relaxation of arteries preconstricted with PGF2 alpha.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "352": "Chronic hypertension is associated with impaired endothelial function [i.e., reduced synthesis/release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) and increased synthesis/release of endothelium-derived contracting factor (EDCF)] in both animals and humans. Although it is not known whether endothelial dysfunction is the consequence and/or an important pathogenetic cause of hypertension, the goal of effective antihypertensive therapy should include restoration of normal endothelial function as well. Because angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are effectively used in the treatment of hypertension, the aim of the present study was to test whether in vivo treatment of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) with the ACE inhibitor cilazapril improves endothelial function in the isolated thoracic aorta of SHRs. Treatment of SHRs with cilazapril (10 mg/kg/day orally for 2 weeks) resulted in a significant decrease in blood pressure and normalization of endothelium-dependent relaxation evoked by acetylcholine (ACh) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP). However, cilazapril treatment had no significant effect on endothelium-dependent contractions evoked by 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT; serotonin) and prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha). In contrast, in vitro treatment of isolated thoracic aortas with indomethacin (10(-5) M) normalized endothelium-dependent relaxations to ACh and ADP as well as inhibited endothelium-dependent contractions to 5-HT and PGF2 alpha. These results suggest that the ACE inhibitor cilazapril increases the synthesis/release of EDRFs whereas indomethacin prevents the synthesis/release of cyclo-oxygenase-derived EDCFs in the endothelium of rat aorta. The exact mechanism of action of ACE inhibitors on endothelial dysfunction remains to be determined.", 
    "353": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) participates in the regulation of vascular tone; its effects were studied in human internal mammary artery (IMA) and saphenous vein (SV) suspended in organ chambers for isometric tension recording. The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalaprilat (10(-7) M) markedly augmented endothelium-dependent relaxations to bradykinin in SV (concentration shift: 10-fold; n = 6; p < 0.005), but not in IMA; in both blood vessels, it had no effect on endothelium-dependent relaxations to acetylcholine. The contractions to angiotensin I (Ang I; 10(-7) M) were markedly inhibited by enalaprilat (10(-7) M) in SV (control: 34 +/- 6% of 100 mM KCl; treatment: 18 +/- 6%; n = 7; p < 0.05) but not in IMA (control: 33 +/- 4%; treatment: 30 +/- 6%; n = 7; NS) and abolished by the Ang II receptor antagonist DuP 753 (10(-7) M) in both blood vessels. Ang II (10(-7) M) induced more pronounced contractions than Ang I in IMA (63 +/- 4%) and SV (63 +/- 5%; n = 5-6; p < 0.05 vs. Ang I), which was markedly inhibited by DuP 753 (10(-7) M; IMA: 21 +/- 5%; SV: 32 +/- 5%; p < 0.05). Thus, in SV but not IMA, ACE inactivates bradykinin and thereby blunts endothelium-dependent relaxations to the peptide and converts Ang I to Ang II.", 
    "354": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors were designed to prevent the vasoconstrictor influence of the activated renin-angiotensin system. However, it has long been suspected that the vasodilator actions of these compounds are not entirely related to inhibition of the generation of angiotensin II. Bradykinin, which is rapidly degraded by ACE, stimulates the release of endothelium-derived vasodilator mediators, including nitric oxide, endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor, and prostacyclin. These mediators do not contribute to the vasodilator effect of bradykinin in every arterial bed. However, the prevention by ACE inhibitors of the degradation of bradykinin-induces an augmentation of the production of these substances and thus potentiates the dilatation evoked by the peptide. The existence of a local kallikrein-kinin system in the vascular wall has been demonstrated, and locally generated kinins contribute to the acute vasodilator actions of ACE inhibitors. ACE inhibitors can potentiate endothelium-dependent dilatations evoked by neurohumoral mediators that are not substrates for ACE. Thus, the vasodilator properties of ACE inhibitors not only reflect inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system but also depend on the enhanced production of endothelium-derived mediators.", 
    "355": "Vascular angiotensin plays an important role in the long-term regulation of the blood vessel function and structure. Angiotensin stimulates vascular smooth-muscle cell growth via the induction of protooncogene and autocrine growth factor gene expressions. In hypertension, atherosclerosis and restenosis, vascular angiotensin activity is increased and participates in the pathobiology of these vascular diseases. Experimental data demonstrate that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors can prevent vascular hypertrophy of hypertension, attenuate atherosclerosis, and inhibit neointimal hyperplasia of restenosis. Taken together, the data show that pharmacologic blockade of the vascular renin-angiotensin system may result in vascular protection. Ongoing clinical trials (MERCATOR, QUIET) will address the relevance of these experimental observations in clinical therapy.", 
    "356": "There are chemical differences among angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors that profoundly influence the pharmacokinetics and dynamics of different drugs. Differences in potency, affinity, and duration of action can be readily identified. These factors, together with individual binding characteristics of drug (or metabolite) to ACE, may influence the profile of hemodynamics and adverse effects, including first-dose hypotension and renal impairment. Differential inhibition of ACE in tissues (e.g., heart, brain, adrenal, kidney, blood vessel) could be important in identifying a particular ACE inhibitor for a specific clinical indication.", 
    "357": "Hypertension frequently is associated with a number of changes in heart structure and function, such as left ventricular hypertrophy, disturbed diastolic function, and subnormal stroke volume during exercise. Most of these changes probably are related to myocardial fibrosis. Antihypertensive agents reverse the structural and functional changes to different degrees. The hemodynamic changes in central hemodynamics at rest and during exercise were studied before and after angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition in 68 patients with essential hypertension (ranging from severe to moderately severe). In patients with moderately severe hypertension who were administered perindoprilat intravenously, mean arterial pressure was reduced by approximately 17% due to reduction in total peripheral resistance and no changes in heart pump function. Chronic treatment with captopril, enalapril, or lisinopril for 6-12 months induced reduction in blood pressure associated with decreased peripheral resistance. In general, there were only minor changes in cardiac output, stroke volume, and heart rate. Studies from other laboratories have shown that ACE inhibitors reverse left ventricular hypertrophy and improve left ventricular diastolic function. Captopril also appears to improve coronary circulation. The effect of ACE inhibitors on heart structure and function appears promising with regard to cardioprotection during chronic use, but long-term studies are needed to prove that this will occur in clinical practice.", 
    "358": "The goal of an antihypertensive treatment is to prevent \"end-organ\" damage. Cerebral vascular complications are among the most important because they are life threatening and can occur even at an early stage of the disease. Recently, it has been shown that cilazapril can decrease the mortality of stroke-prone rats, suggesting a decrease in the incidence of strokes, which occur spontaneously in these animals. The present article reviews the different functional and morphological changes that may explain the cerebral protective effects of cilazapril, such as the normalization of cerebral vascular reserve, decrease in the media, increase in the external diameter, and normalization of the mechanics and endothelial function of cerebral arterioles. In addition, the inhibition by cilazapril of injury-induced proliferation of smooth muscle cells and the infiltration of the endothelium by macrophages could prevent the development of atherosclerosis.", 
    "359": "Modern molecular medicine is increasingly bridging the gap between basic research and experimental pharmacology and clinical therapeutics and practical medicine. The challenge in hypertension research is to elucidate the primary, genetic causes of elevated blood pressure. The problems with understanding primary (genetic) hypertension in humans are that (a) several genes are involved in the cardiovascular control mechanisms, (b) the genetics are complex, and (c) environmental factors that act over long spans of time confound the genotype/phenotype relationship individually, within a family, and regionally. Polygenetic diseases such as primary hypertension remain puzzles, which necessitates well-defined experimental models and new strategies in the genetics of human primary hypertension. This article will focus on the advances in molecular genetics of hypertension. Using gene technology it is possible to introduce new, additional genes in normotensive and hypertensive animals. In the mouse, it is possible to delete or mutate specific genes; similar technology is being developed for use in the rat.", 
    "360": "Twenty-four-hour \"ambulatory blood pressure monitoring\" (ABPM) was performed during the day at every 30 min and during the night at every 60 min in 38 persons admitted to the hospital. The subjects were divided into four groups: Group 1. healthy subjects (11); Group 2. essential hypertensive patients (7) before and during enalapril treatment; Group 3. patients with essential hypertension (10) treated with different antihypertensive drugs and Group 4. renal patients treated as in Group 3. Normal circadian rhythm was found in the healthy subjects and in the patients with essential hypertension, but no rhythm could be demonstrated in the renal patients. The high blood pressure decreased in response to enalapril in 7 patients without any decrease in the circadian rhythm. It was concluded that antihypertensive therapy does not abolish the circadian rhythm if there is any--and does not restore if it is lacking. The chances of the diagnostic use of circadian blood pressure rhythm are not impaired by the antihypertensive treatment.",

She presented with classical symptoms: malignant hypertension of sudden onset and rapidly progressive renal failure. End-stage renal failure developed in spite of treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and the patient became dialysis-dependent. Five years later her condition was still stable. She lived in a nursing home, severely disabled but mentally healthy. A renal crisis is one of the most life threatening complications of scleroderma. By immediate treatment with ACE inhibitors, dependence on haemodialysis can be prevented in half the patients.", 
    "362": "The pharmacologic approach to coronary protection, defined here as the prevention or delay of sudden death and myocardial infarction (without negatively affecting noncardiac mortality), is critically discussed. The value of pharmacologically treating mild hypertension and mild hypercholesterolemia is questioned, and the need for well-designed, randomized clinical trials with definitive endpoints to determine a drug's cardioprotective capability is emphasized. Based on such studies, it is concluded that some (but perhaps not all) beta-receptor antagonists as well as aspirin have been shown to protect against sudden cardiac death. Trials of thiazide diuretics, calcium antagonists, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have not shown a reduction in sudden cardiac death, despite having individual benefits with respect to other aspects of cardiovascular disease. The demonstration that some beta blockers are cardioprotective is discussed in terms of the pathophysiology of sudden cardiac death, and differences in the pharmacokinetic profiles of individual agents.",

In addition to their antihypertensive activity, their effects on left ventricular hypertrophy, lipid profiles, and insulin sensitivity are discussed in comparison to the effects of other classes of antihypertensive agents on these risk factors. The ability of ACE inhibitors to prevent the progression of congestive heart failure and reduce mortality is documented and a summary of data demonstrating benefits of their use in postmyocardial infarction patients with low ejection fraction is presented.", 
    "364": "Responses to opioids can be bimodal depending on the concentration of opioid used. For example, low concentrations (nM) enhance whereas higher concentrations (10-100 nM) inhibit the electrically evoked release of enkephalin from the myenteric plexus. The nature of the responsiveness of the enkephalin release process to opioids is also dependent on the intracellular and/or extracellular milieu of enkephalin-containing neurons or other neurons of this plexus. Intracellular levels of cAMP, availability of pertussis toxin- and cholera toxin-sensitive guanine nucleotide binding proteins and intracellular calcium concentration have all been shown to be important determinants of opioid excitatory versus inhibitory actions. The present data indicate that the inhibition of enkephalin release produced by U50,488H or sufentanil is no longer observed when the applied voltage is increased 3- or 2-fold, respectively. Under this condition, a previously inhibitory concentration of opioid produces an enhancement of stimulated enkephalin release. Increasing the frequency of the applied stimulation from 5 to 60 Hz (at a constant voltage) also reverses the sufentanil-induced inhibition to a facilitation of enkephalin release. These data indicate that the intensity (voltage) or frequency of the stimulation that is used to release enkephalin is a critical determinant of the nature of its modulation by opioids. The possible relevance of these findings to known differences in opioid sensitivity between different types of pain is discussed.",

There is more information concerning the captopril test, which has a sufficiently high sensitivity to be useful in the screening of high-risk patients for renovascular hypertension. Scans after captopril administration, which appear to be more specific, may enable the prediction of a blood pressure response to angioplasty or surgery.", 
    "371": "In our work evaluating the antioxidant properties of a number of cardiovascular drugs, we have emphasized the importance of lipophilicity as a property contributing to antioxidant potency. Thus, the dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers and propranolol, one of the most lipophilic beta-blockers, were found to exhibit the greatest potency in membrane and cellular models. Both beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers are classified as antihypertensive agents. We found that the specific chemical moieties of various drugs may participate in the antioxidant mechanism of action. While reviewing relevant work from the past literature, it became apparent that some of the chemical moieties of antihypertensive and vasodilator drugs may bind transition metals. Thus, this present review focuses on common properties of transition metal-interaction that are shared, to a greater or lesser degree, by a number of vasoactive drugs and chemical agents. Although this observation has been pursued by other investigators in the past, we submit that the potential relevance to the newer pharmacological agents needs to be explored further. In addition, new information regarding the role of transition metals and free radicals involving vascular cells focuses greater importance on transition metal-interaction as a potential mechanism in vasodilation. This review does not intend to be inclusive of all chemical structures capable of binding transition metals; only those that are clinically relevant will be considered in some detail. Potential mechanisms of metal-chelating actions leading to vasodilation are also discussed.", 
    "372": "Angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are now widely used to treat patients with high blood pressure or heart failure. The favourable results obtained with these inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system suggest that angiotensin II has a noxious effect on the development and/or course of these diseases. ACE inhibitors are usually well tolerated. Their most severe side-effects are mostly foreseeable and therefore avoidable. Chronic blockade of the renin-angiotensin system increasingly seems to be a good therapeutic approach to the protection of the vital organs.", 
    "373": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE; EC 3.4.15.1) was purified from porcine kidney and lung (endothelial isoenzyme) and testis (testicular isoenzyme) by affinity chromatography on lisinopril-2.8 nm-Sepharose. Atomic-absorption spectroscopy revealed that ACE purified from kidney and lung contained 2.58 and 2.35 atoms of zinc per molecule of enzyme (M(r) 147,000) respectively. In contrast, ACE purified from testis contained only 1.58 atoms of zinc per molecule of enzyme (M(r) 80,000). Thus it would appear that both putative zinc-binding sites in endothelial ACE contain zinc and may therefore be catalytically active. No differences were observed in the pattern of products generated on hydrolysis of benzoyl (Bz)-Gly-His-Leu, substance P, luteinizing-hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) and its analogue, des-Gly10-LH-RH-ethylamide, by kidney and testicular ACE. There was also no difference in the initial rates of hydrolysis of Bz-Gly-His-Leu or substance P by the two isoenzymes, although LH-RH and its analogue were hydrolysed twice as rapidly by kidney ACE. It is therefore unlikely that the N-terminal catalytic site in porcine endothelial ACE is predominantly responsible for the atypical cleavage of LH-RH generating the N-terminal tripeptide. Two polyclonal antisera were raised to the affinity-purified forms of pig kidney and testicular ACE. Isoenzyme-specific antisera were then isolated from these by absorbing out those antibodies recognizing determinants on the other isoenzyme. Immunoelectrophoretic blot analyses and immunofluorescent staining of sections of pig kidney were used to demonstrate the specificity of the antisera. Immunofluorescent staining of sections of pig testis with the antiserum specific to testicular ACE localized testicular ACE solely to the lumen of the seminiferous tubules, whereas the antiserum specific to endothelial ACE revealed the presence of this isoenzyme only in blood vessels. The antiserum to endothelial ACE, which recognizes determinants in the unique N-terminal domain, was investigated as a possible specific inhibitor of the N-terminal catalytic site. Although this antiserum failed to inhibit testicular ACE, the effect on the activity of endothelial ACE appeared to be due to inhibition of both the N- and C-terminal catalytic sites.", 
    "374": "ACE inhibitors are used on a large scale basis in hypertensive diabetics, while the association between diabetes and hypertension is frequent and harmful. This is due to their excellent tolerance and efficacity. No specific advantage has been reported in their use regarding tolerance, i.e., they may not alter insulin sensitivity consistently. Conversely, ACE inhibitors may offer the specific advantage of protecting kidney function against diabetic microangiopathy, since their effects on glomerular haemodynamics seem independent from their hypotensive effect.", 
    "375": "Nearly 15 years ago, it has been shown that myocardial infarction is accompanied by left ventricular dilatation. In the following years more details were obtained on morphological changes consecutive to myocardial infarction, now grouped together under the term left ventricular remodelling. These changes enable the patients to survive despite reduction of the contractile ventricular mass, but they expose the ventricles to constraints resulting in excessive work load. It has been shown that these changes can be reduced by early myocardial reperfusion and by administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. These findings were established first in animals, then in man. Administering ACE inhibitors to patients with symptomatic heart failure consecutive to advanced ischaemic cardiopathy prolongs the patients' survival. When ACE inhibitors are given to patients with severe asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction which started soon or long after a myocardial infarction, they reduce the frequency of ischaemic events, passage to symptomatic heart failure and, at least in one study, mortality. ACE inhibitors have also been shown to reduce the size of myocardial necrosis when administered in the acute phase of experimental myocardial infarction. Preliminary data have demonstrated that ACE inhibitors given in the acute phase of myocardial infarction reduce the left ventricular dilatation which follows infarction. However, a study of ACE inhibitors administered to a large number of patients in the acute phase of myocardial infarction had to be interrupted because of the over-mortality in the treated group. These facts are reviewed in this article, and attempts have been made at deducing from them the current indications of ACE inhibitors in patients with coronary heart disease.", 
    "376": "Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors can begin at any time when a left ventricular dysfunction has been diagnosed. In the absence of rare contra-indications (renal artery stenosis, connective tissue disease, severe renal failure), all patients with asymptomatic or, a fortiori, symptomatic chronic heart failure can benefit from ACE inhibitors, whatever the origin of the heart failure. Among the ACE inhibitors now available, the benefits of captopril (3 daily doses) and of enalapril (2 daily doses) on all the targets of cardiac failure treatment are now well established. The effects of lisinopril on mortality are not yet known, but the haemodynamic and symptomatic benefits of this drug are also well established (with the advantage of once daily administration). Other ACE inhibitors with less numerous and less convincing trial reports can be used or rejected depending on the physician's faith in the effects of this pharmaceutical class. With all ACE inhibitors the initial dose must be very low, to be gradually increased over several days or even weeks until the highest dose tolerated is reached. ACE inhibitors can be associated with the classical treatment of cardiac failure. A previous diuretic treatment with sodium depletion may increase the risks of first dose effect and renal intolerance due to the introduction of the ACE inhibitors. Theoretically, the combination of ACE inhibitors and spironolactone is to be avoided for fear of hyperkalaemia and renal deterioration. Yet, provided some precautions are taken this combination may improve the benefits of ACE inhibition when the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibition is not optimal. However, this has yet to be demonstrated by prospective clinical trials.", 
    "377": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors were introduced in the treatment of heart failure in 1982. They improve the life comfort of the patients and their capacity for exercise in both moderate and severe heart failure. In moderate heart failure, their effectiveness on exercise performance is about the same as that of digitalis compounds and classical vasodilators, and superior to that of diuretics. The superiority of ACE inhibitors lies in that they improve the prognosis of heart failure, as has been demonstrated in the severe and moderate forms of the disease and, quite recently, in asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction following myocardial infarction. Their beneficial effects on mortality undoubtedly result from their favourable action on the neurohormonal systems which are activated early in the course of heart failure. Extending the indications of these drugs to asymptomatic patients raises questions concerning optimal dosage, date of initiation and duration of treatment and possible class effect.", 
    "378": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are now widely used as first-line treatment of essential hypertension. Their effectiveness is potentiated by a low-salt diet and, above all, by the simultaneous prescription of diuretics. When secondary hypertension is suspected, ACE inhibitors are a good pharmacological tool to study the renin-angiotensin system. Since activation of this system is the main mechanism responsible for renovascular hypertension, ACE inhibitors are very useful for diagnosis. Conversely, blood pressure is not influenced by ACE inhibitors in primary hyperaldosteronism because of the low plasma renin and angiotensin II levels. Pheochromocytoma activates the renin-angiotensin system, and ACE inhibitors combined with beta-blockers enable the hypertension to be controlled prior to surgical treatment of the tumour. Finally, ACE inhibitors can be used to explore the renin-angiotensin system in the experimental model of renovascular hypertension and therefore contribute to our knowledge of the complex pathophysiology of this most frequent type of secondary hypertension.", 
    "379": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors act by lowering the level of angiotensin II. The therapeutic benefits of these drugs and their potential side-effects therefore result from suppression of the physiological effects of angiotensin II. It is rational to prescribe an ACE inhibitor when the renin-angiotensin system is activated, as in renin-dependent essential hypertension, malignant hypertension and hypertension associated with heart failure. The beneficial effects of ACE inhibitor must be weighed against the special risks of renovascular hypertension: risk of renal artery thrombosis in case of unilateral stenosis and risk of renal failure if the stenosis is bilateral or affects a solitary kidney. In some situations the renin-angiotensin system is not directly involved in hypertension but may play a local haemodynamic role, as in some cases of primary or diabetic nephropathy. In such case the ACE inhibitors are thought to exert a protective effect. ACE inhibitors were reputed to be less effective in the elderly than in younger patients, but we now know that they can be prescribed with equal success in both instances to reduce peripheral resistance and improve regional blood flow as well as arterial compliance. Finally, ACE inhibitors can be prescribed, albeit with limited effectiveness, when the renin-angiotensin system is not activated, as in low renin hypertension and idiopathic hyperaldosteronism due to adrenal hyperplasia. They are ineffective in case of Conn's adenoma and contra-indicated in pregnant women.", 
    "380": "Lowering blood pressure by medical treatment is not enough for correct prevention of the cardiovascular complications of high blood pressure. In this respect, we would like to emphasize the potential value of the non-antihypertensive effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors which may be summarized as follows. In the heart, ACE inhibitors significantly reduce left ventricular hypertrophy. They have no noticeable anti-ischaemic activity and are devoid of antiarrhythmic effects. On the kidneys, ACE inhibitors seem to have a protective effect, still to be determined, in certain cases of diabetes or renal impairment. ACE inhibitors have no deleterious metabolic effects. Other antihypertensive agents share the same properties. Long-term comparative trials are necessary to find out whether some of these drugs are more effective in this field than the others.", 
    "381": "Novel angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) have recently been commercialized and the question arises whether differences in pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties should lead to specific therapeutic choices. To our knowledge there is no data which allows the physician to conclude to any different antihypertensive efficacy when ACE inhibitors are used at adequate dosage. Their pharmacokinetic characteristics may differ at every level: absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion. Differences in chemical structure may also influence their diffusion in various tissues, therefrom the amplitude and duration of inhibition of angiotensin II at these sites. The duration of maximum blockade of ACE and the amplitude of residual blockade may theoretically influence the duration of the hypotensive effect and the number of daily dosages. Once-daily administered long acting ACE inhibitors keep their antihypertensive action through the whole 24-hour period, during chronic treatment. The theoretical advantage of such a property is an improved control of 24-hour blood pressure. However, no study, to our knowledge, concluded to any difference between long acting ACE inhibitors as far as this parameter was concerned. In addition, except captopril which has been reported to induce major untoward effects at the time high dosages were introduced, ACE inhibitors do not seem to bear different undesirable effects.", 
    "382": "Hyperkalemia is a severe complication of end-stage renal failure. To evaluate whether ACE inhibitors may even worsen the propensity to develop hyperkalemia in this condition, we have analyzed retrospectively pre-dialytic blood pressure and serum potassium in 15 patients on chronic hemodialysis before and during long-term ACE inhibition. This treatment induced a significant drop in blood pressure (from 173 +/- 3/90 +/- 2 to 159 +/- 5/85 +/- 2 mm Hg [p < 0.05]), whereas serum potassium increased from 4.9 +/- 0.2 to 5.5 +/- 0.2 mM (p < 0.05), irrespective of the dosage of ACE inhibitor and of the residual diuresis. Hyperkalemia was well tolerated and was corrected in all patients by dialysis; treatment was discontinued in only one case. In conclusion, ACE inhibitors represent effective antihypertensive treatment in end-stage renal failure. However, long-term ACE inhibition may be accompanied by a worsening of hyperkalemia, which could be accounted for by a reduced effect of aldosterone on extrarenal potassium homeostasis.", 
    "383": "Distribution of differently glycosylated forms of active and inactive renin was investigated in fractions prepared by discontinuous density gradient centrifugation of rat kidney cortex homogenate. Concanavalin A (con A) chromatography separated active and inactive renin into three differently glycosylated forms in both cytosol and granule fractions: a minor con A unbound form (I), a loosely bound form (II), and the most predominant tightly bound form (III). After a long-term stimulation of renin synthesis and secretion by sodium depletion and captopril treatment the relative proportion of active renins I and II in granules significantly increased, while that of active renin III decreased. The relative proportion of inactive renins I and II in granule compared to cytosol fractions was significantly higher and that of inactive renin III was lower. The results indicate that glycosylation might have some relation to the rate of sorting of prorenin into the granules, or of its processing within granules. Alternatively, it might influence the rate of inactive renin release via the constitutive pathway.", 
    "384": "Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors was given to 16 patients with glomerular nephritis in whom a complete remission of nephrotic syndrome could not be achieved with immunosuppressive-anti-inflammatory therapy. Captopril in the daily dose of 25-75 mg and enalapril in the daily dose of 10 mg were administered for 1-36 months (mean 12.6 months). Daily proteinuria decreased by 40-80% comparing with baseline value in 2/3 of patients. Total protein and albumin serum levels increased simultaneously. No changes in blood creatinine were noted in patients with initially normal renal functioning except one patient. Renal functioning was stable in 50% of patients with increased blood creatinine levels (mean 200 mumol/L). Blood creatinine was increasing in the remaining patients.", 
    "385": "The migration of smooth muscle cells from the media to the intima that occurs after balloon catheter injury to the rat common carotid artery has been quantified by an electron microscopic surveying technique. These vessels have also been assayed for plasminogen-activator activity, which was found to rise sharply 4 days after balloon injury. At this time point smooth muscle cells begin to migrate in appreciable numbers. In order to investigate whether there is a causal relationship between plasminogen-activator activity and smooth muscle cell migration, animals were dosed with tranexamic acid. This synthetic inhibitor of plasmin activity reduced smooth muscle cell migration by 73% (p < 0.05), indicating that plasmin activity is necessary for migration after balloon injury. Lisinopril, an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme, inhibited smooth muscle cell migration after balloon injury by 78% (p < 0.01) but did not influence plasminogen-activator activity. Taken together, these results show that plasmin is a necessary but not sufficient component in the pathway that leads to smooth muscle cell migration after balloon catheter injury in the rat.", 
    "386": "Endogenous opioids are known to be involved in the pathophysiology of idiopathic headache. In fact, decreased levels of enkephalin (E) or endorphin (BE) during headache attacks might be a marker of an altered pain-inhibiting system of central neurotransmission or could be secondary to alterations of brain circulation that often occur during the headache crisis. Recently, captopril (C) has been shown to be apt to restore the availability of endogenous opioids, to improve cerebral blood flow via the inhibition of both the cerebral and systemic renin-angiotensin system or of catecholamine release. It has also been reported to be able to restore the nociceptive-antinociceptive balance through an increase of serum kinin (K) or prostaglandin (Pr) levels. In the present study, the efficacy of C in reducing the frequency (F), duration (D), or severity (S) of headache paroxysm were investigated in a double blind trial vs. placebo (P). Twenty-six subjects (5 males and 21 females; mean age 37 +/- 11 years) suffering from idiopathic headache at least for one year have been allocated to treatment with C (25 mg three times/day) or P according to a double-blind randomized protocol for 4 months. The effects of C or P have been evaluated with Migraine Index Correct, related to changes in F, D or S of headache attacks. Our results indicate that C is effective in reducing F, D or S in subjects with idiopathic headache.", 
    "387": "The effect of separate and combined blockade of vasopressin (AVP) V1-receptors and angiotensin II formation on resistance to a slow venous haemorrhage (0.7 ml kg-1 min-1) was studied in six conscious adult sheep by bleeding to the point of an abrupt fall in the mean systemic arterial pressure (MSAP). Intravenous administration of the V1-receptor antagonist [d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)AVP] (10 micrograms kg-1) and/or the angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (20 mg + 1 mg h-1) did not cause any significant haemodynamic changes in the normovolaemic animal. The volume of haemorrhage necessary to induce acute hypotension (MSAP < 50 mmHg) was significantly smaller after AVP blockade alone (13.8 +/- 0.7 ml kg-1; P < 0.01) but not after captopril treatment (14.7 +/- 1.6 ml kg-1; n.s.) compared to control animals receiving no drug treatment (16.8 +/- 0.6 ml kg-1). The combined treatment with the AVP antagonist and captopril caused a further decrease in tolerance to haemorrhage (9.4 +/- 1.2 ml kg-1; P < 0.001). Blockade of AVP V1-receptors was associated with an attenuated increase in systemic vascular resistance immediately after the end of haemorrhage, concomitant with an accentuated lowering of the central venous pressure. In contrast, captopril treatment decreased the degree of vasoconstriction mainly during the second half of the posthaemorrhage observation period of 1 hour. It is concluded that both AVP and angiotensin II contribute to the maintenance of the MSAP during haemorrhage in conscious sheep.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "388": "For a more precise understanding of the net effects of acute alterations of pre- and afterload on left-ventricular filling, loading conditions were altered in normal subjects. The specific purpose of this study was to investigate if Dopplerechocardiographically derived transmitral flow patterns are able to differentiate the manner of loading condition. In 24 normal subjects (13 female, 11 male, mean age 44.1 +/- 11.5 years) the following Doppler variables were analyzed at baseline, after rapid infusion of volume (preload increase), nitroglycerine (preload decrease), isometric exercise (afterload increase) and converting enzyme inhibitor (afterload decrease): peak and integrated early (E, Ei) and late (A, Ai) diastolic flow velocities, their ratios (E/A, Ei/Ai), the percentage of atrial contribution (ACON) and the times of acceleration (Az) and deceleration (Dz) of early filling. Preload reduction as well as afterload increase led to a similar filling pattern with a significant decrease (p < 0.05 from baseline) of E and Ei, increase of A and Ai, and, consequently, a reduction of E/A and Ei/Ai. The atrial contribution to filling increased during both alterations; Az and Dz were reduced. Following the increase of preload, only the increase of E and Ei was statistically significant, while afterload reduction showed no significant differences. Different loading conditions alter Doppler-derived diastolic filling patterns. But the transmitral flow profile is not specific enough to differentiate in which manner loading conditions have been altered.",

The myocardium had a significantly lower (P < 0.05) energy charge (EC) during CHF (0.63 +/- 0.01) than in sham-operated controls (0.82 +/- 0.02). This was due to significant differences in concentrations in ATP (-48%), ADP (29%), and AMP (275%) in the RVP group. However, the total adenine nucleotide pool was not different between groups. Myocardial lactate concentration was also similar. Glycogen was significantly lower (P < 0.05) by 20% at peak CHF. The adenine nucleotides were similar among the different myocardial layers (endo-, mid-, and epicardium). The administration of enalapril (an inhibitor of angiotension-converting enzyme) to decrease vascular resistance had no effect on the myocardial energy status of CHF dogs. These findings suggest that the lower EC in CHF animals is not the result of subendocardial ischemia. Also, lower EC is not associated with endogenous glycogen depletion or increased lactate concentration. The energy status of the myocardium in RVP-induced CHF is unlike that seen in ischemia-induced heart failure. This suggests that CHF in RVP is not vascular in origin.", 
    "390": "Acute angioneurotic edema due to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors usually develops shortly after therapy has been started. In this case, hypopharyngeal edema occurred with a delay of nine days. It required endotracheal intubation and could only be differentiated from an inflammatory process by examination under general anesthesia. The mechanism of action of ACE inhibitors, the pathogenesis of angioneurotic edema, its therapy outside as well as in the hospital, and the case described are being discussed. It is concluded that severe reactions induced by ACE inhibitors must be expected even after considerable time of therapy.", 
    "391": "Because the area postrema seems essential for chemotherapy-induced vomiting, both circulating and/or neurally mediated stimuli in this area could trigger the emetic response. In our laboratories results of cross-circulation and direct intracerebroventricular infusion experiments in dogs do not support a role for circulating substances. The large increases in serum vasopressin induced by cisplatin were not blocked by inhibitors of the angiotensin-converting enzyme. In the ferret inhibition of serotonin synthesis with p-chloro-phenylalanine, administration of selective antagonists of 5-hydroxy-tryptamine3 (5-HT3) receptors, or visceral deafferentation inhibited the emetic response evoked by cisplatin or high-dose cyclophosphamide. The results suggest that serotonin plays an important role and that peripheral neural mechanisms are involved in the emetic response. The strong antiemetic efficacy of selective 5-HT3 antagonists also has been confirmed in humans. In cancer patients high-dose cisplatin increased the plasma and urinary levels of 5-hydroxy-indoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), but did not affect platelet and free plasma serotonin. The changes in 5-HIAA levels paralleled the onset and development of vomiting. No evidence of serotonin depletion has been obtained after high-dose cisplatin. Dacarbazine, another strongly emetogenic agent, increased urinary 5-HIAA; however, only small increases in 5-HIAA were produced with low-dose cisplatin or cyclophosphamide-containing regimens. Thus, emetogenicity appears to be directly related to the ability of the cytotoxic agent to release serotonin. In humans, antiemetics such as ondansetron, metoclopramide, and dexamethasone did not effect high-dose cisplatin-induced increases in serotonin metabolism. Therefore, these antiemetics seem not to affect the amount of serotonin released. The mechanism by which chemotherapeutic drugs induce serotonin release is unknown; however, release may occur by direct cytotoxicity on the gastrointestinal mucosa, including the enterochromaffin cells. Delayed emesis appears to be mediated by 5-HT3-independent mechanisms. It is proposed that emesis that develops despite high-dose ondansetron (residual emesis) should be considered delayed emesis. Residual and delayed episodes of emesis have similar time courses, are characterized by very mild emetic episodes and poor response to 5-HT3 antagonists, and are not associated with increases in serotonin metabolism.", 
    "392": "The hypothesis that converting enzyme inhibition and a protein-restricted diet could have additive antiproteinuric effects has been tested. A group of 17 patients with proteinuria in excess of 3 g/24 h per 1.73 m2 of body surface area were submitted to a 3-wk period of study, after a 4-wk wash-out period during which protein intake was 1.0 g/kg per day and in the absence of any medication. During the first and second weeks of the study, protein intake was lowered to 0.3 g/kg per day, and in the third week, it returned to 1.0 g/kg per day. Enalapril (20 mg daily) was administered during the second and third weeks of the study. Initially and at the end of each week thereafter, we determined blood pressure, GFR (inulin clearance), RPF (para-aminohippurate clearance), plasma sodium and potassium, PRA and aldosterone, and the 24-h urine excretion of sodium potassium, protein, and urea. The low protein intake during the first week induced a significant fall of proteinuria (P < 0.01), GFR (P < 0.01), and RPF (P < 0.01) in the absence of changes in filtration fraction. The addition of enalapril induced a further decrease of proteinuria (P < 0.01) and a fall in filtration fraction (P < 0.05), whereas plasma potassium, PRA, GFR, and RPF values increased (P < 0.01). The rise in protein intake during the last week of the study induced a significant rise in proteinuria, GFR, and RPF (P < 0.01), although the first of these parameters attained values significantly lower (P < 0.05) than those observed initially.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "393": "Both experimental and clinical radiation nephropathy are typically progressive, evolving to kidney failure over weeks to months. Other late radiation injuries (spinal cord, lung) are also progressive and have no known specific antidote. Recent reports of the efficacy of captopril in modifying radiation injury of the lung prompted this trial of captopril in treating established radiation nephropathy. Six months after 15-27 Gy in 12 fractions bilateral renal irradiation, 72 rats with blood urea nitrogen > 4.1 mmol/liter were started on captopril (500 mg/liter) or no drug in the drinking water. Subsequent survival was significantly enhanced in rats receiving captopril as opposed to no drug (P = 0.0013), and the rate of rise of blood urea nitrogen was significantly diminished (P < 0.0001) in the animals on captopril. Urine protein excretion was also reduced from initially elevated levels in the rats on captopril compared to levels in rats given no drug. We conclude that captopril therapy preserves kidney function, reduces proteinuria, and enhances survival in experimental radiation nephropathy.", 
    "394": "Fifteen patients presented between January 1986 and January 1991 with deterioration in renal function coincident with the introduction of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. There was evidence of extrarenal vascular disease in 12 patients and preexisting renal impairment in 13. Four patients remained dialysis-dependent and died within 4 weeks of presentation. Five patients required short-term dialysis. Serum creatinine remained above pre-treatment values in seven patients. Conventional explanations of the decline in renal function with ACE inhibition do not account for irreversible decrements in renal function. Possible mechanisms for this observation and clinical guidelines to identify patients at risk are suggested. We conclude that these agents should be used with great care in patients in whom atherosclerotic vascular disease is likely.",

Patients were initially treated single-blind for 1 week with ramipril 2.5 mg and 3 weeks with ramipril 5 mg. Of 240 patients enrolled, 165 were subsequently classed as nonresponders (diastolic blood pressure > 90 mmHg) and were randomized to one of the three double-blind treatments for a further 4 weeks. In the double-blind phase, the mean reductions in supine systolic and diastolic blood pressures at end point were significantly greater in the 5 mg plus 25 mg combination group (11.6/10.6 mmHg) than in the groups receiving ramipril 5 mg (6.2/5.9 mmHg; both p < 0.01) and ramipril 10 mg (7.4/7.1 mmHg; both p < 0.05). The proportion of responders at end point was also higher for combination therapy (72%) than for monotherapy (48% for ramipril 5 mg and 62% for ramipril 10 mg). All three treatments were well tolerated. Analysis of laboratory values revealed no clinically important changes.", 
    "396": "Glomerular hemodynamics of the clipped kidney in two kidney-one clip Goldblatt-hypertensive rats were studied by micropuncture techniques after administration of either captopril (20 mg/kg of b.wt./day p.o.) or diltiazem (3 mg/kg of b.wt./hr i.v.). Both drugs decreased mean arterial and poststenotic renal arterial pressure to comparable levels. Total kidney glomerular filtration rate was not significantly different in the three groups (0.78 +/- 0.09 in hypertensive controls, 0.62 +/- 0.11 after captopril and 0.74 +/- 0.07 ml/min/g of kidney weight after diltiazem). Glomerular capillary pressure fell significantly in both treated groups but was lower in captopril-treated animals (60 +/- 2 in hypertensive controls, 45 +/- 2 after captopril and 53 +/- 1 mm Hg after diltiazem, both P < .05 vs. hypertensive controls). Afferent arteriolar resistance was lowered in both treatment groups to the same extent, whereas only captopril decreased efferent arteriolar resistance. Single nephron filtration rate of cortical nephrons was not altered significantly by captopril due to a 96% increase in the ultrafiltration coefficient and a 58% rise in glomerular plasma flow, whereas diltiazem increased ultrafiltration coefficient by 62% but did not affect glomerular plasma flow. These studies indicate that, despite of decreased effective filtration pressure, glomerular filtration rate is well preserved after converting enzyme inhibition. Captopril and diltiazem have different effects on glomerular hemodynamics within the stenosed kidney.", 
    "397": "Activation of the renin-angiotensin and sympathetic nervous systems in heart failure may result in altered baroreflex control of heart rate. To determine the specific effects of treatment with captopril on baroreceptor dysfunction in heart failure, baroreflex control of heart rate was measured in conscious rats with heart failure 6 weeks after ligation of the left coronary artery. Plasma norepinephrine was measured as a reflection of sympathetic nervous system activity. After bolus injections of phenylephrine (2-50 micrograms/kg) and nitroprusside (2-50 micrograms/kg), the arterial baroreflex was analyzed by fitting percentage of mean arterial pressure changes and heart rate changes to a logistic regression function. There were no differences in baroreflex function between normal and sham-operated rats. Plasma norepinephrine was increased (P < .05) in the heart-failure rats and did not change with captopril treatment. In untreated rats, heart failure increased (P < .05) the centering point by 900%, threshold by 243% and saturation by 89%, whereas decreasing (P < .05) the operational point by 73%. There was a decrease (P < .05) in the nitroprusside-related gain and an increase (P < .05) in phenylephrine-related gain, but the overall baroreflex gain was not changed. In heart-failure rats, captopril increased (P < .05) threshold, saturation and centering point and decreased (P < .05) operational point and nitroprusside- and phenylephrine-related gain abnormalities. The increase in operational point and decreases in threshold, saturation, centering point and phenylephrine-related gain were the results of a specific interactive effect of captopril in heart failure (P = .0033, .0176, .0509, .0217 and .0567, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "398": "During exercise a marked increase in plasma potassium in healthy subjects has repeatedly been demonstrated. In patients on treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors this may be further augmented. Therefore, the aim of present study was to evaluate the effect of enalapril on exercise-induced hyperkalemia. This was done in patients with acute myocardial infarction randomized to double-blind treatment with enalapril 10-20 mg per day (n = 7) or placebo (n = 6) within 24 h of onset of chest pain, and the results were compared with data from healthy control subjects (n = 11). Baseline plasma potassium did not differ between the three groups; i.e. 4.2, 4.0, and 4.1 mmol/l, respectively. An incremental, symptom-limited, bicycle exercise test was done one month after the myocardial infarction, and blood samples were taken for determination of plasma potassium. The exercise-induced increase in plasma potassium was not higher in the enalapril group as compared to the placebo and control groups, and there was no difference between the enalapril and placebo group, the specific values being 0.6 vs. 0.6 and 0.7 mmol/l, respectively. No difference was observed in the slope (dK/dt) between the 3 groups. In conclusion, enalapril at a dosage of 10-20 mg per day does not provoke any augmentation of the increase in plasma potassium during exercise.",

Male, homozygous Brattleboro (i.e. vasopressin-deficient) rats were chronically instrumented with pulsed Doppler flow probes and intravascular catheters, and were studied 5 h after a subcutaneous injection of an hyperoncotic solution of polyethylene glycol to render them hypovolaemic, and hence dependent on the renin-angiotensin system for maintenance of haemodynamic status. Pilot experiments showed that, in this model, primed infusion of perindoprilat (0.05 mg kg-1 bolus, 0.05 mg kg-1 h-1 infusion) or captopril (0.2 mg kg-1 bolus, 0.2 mg kg-1 h-1 infusion) just abolished the pressor effect of angiotensin I (120 pmol), and had similar initial hypotensive and renal hyperaemic vasodilator effects. 2. Perindoprilat had more sustained hypotensive, and mesenteric and hindquarters vasodilator effects than captopril in the presence of saline. In the presence of NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME 3 mg kg-1 h-1), the renal vasodilator effects of perindoprilat were unchanged, whereas the other haemodynamic effects of perindoprilat and captopril were reduced. Hence, in the presence of L-NAME, all haemodynamic effects of perindoprilat were greater than those of captopril. 3. The renal hyperaemic vasodilator effects of acetylcholine were abolished by L-NAME and by perindoprilat, and were markedly reduced by captopril. However, since perindoprilat and captopril caused such marked renal hyperaemic vasodilatation themselves, it is feasible this change in baseline status contributed to their effects. It is unlikely this could be a full explanation of the results, because the haemodynamic effects of lemakalim were unchanged under any experimental conditions. 4. Bradykinin alone, or in the presence of saline, caused mesenteric hyperaemic vasodilatation whereas, in the presence of perindoprilat or captopril, bradykinin caused marked renal and mesenteric vasoconstrictions. However, in the additional presence of L-NAME, the mesenteric vasoconstriction was reduced, yet the hypotensive effect of bradykinin was augmented. One possible explanation of these observations is that, in the presence of L-NAME and either perindoprilat or captopril, bradykinin caused marked coronary vasoconstriction, leading to a reduction in cardiac output. 5. Neither perindoprilat nor captopril impaired the pressor, or renal, mesenteric, or hindquarters vasoconstrictor effects of L-NAME. Indeed, in their presence, the effects of L-NAME were generally enhanced, consistent with perindoprilat and captopril causing activation of nitric oxide-dependent mechanisms that were subsequently inhibited by L-NAME.", 
    "400": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors decrease albuminuria in patients with diabetic nephropathy. To study the change in albuminuria in relation to changes in systemic and renal hemodynamics, nine normotensive patients with type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus and persistent proteinuria were given a single oral dose of 25 mg of the ACE inhibitor captopril. Blood pressure, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), effective renal plasma flow (ERPF), and albumin excretion rate (AER) were measured in two periods of 40 minutes before and in four periods of 40 minutes after administration of captopril. A constant water diuresis was maintained. Blood pressure did not decrease significantly (130/79 +/- 4/3 v 124/74 +/- 4/3 mm Hg; mean +/- SEM), median AER decreased from 403 (interquartile range [IQR], 812) micrograms/min to 333 (707) micrograms/min (P < 0.01). GFR did not change (123 +/- 13 v 117 +/- 14 mL/min), but ERPF increased significantly from 609 +/- 56 to 714 +/- 55 mL/min (P < 0.01). Consequently, the filtration fraction (FF; quotient of GFR and ERPF) decreased from 0.20 +/- 0.014 to 0.17 +/- 0.014 (P < 0.01). A strong correlation was found between the decrease of AER and the decrease of FF (rs = 0.75; P < 0.02). No correlation was found between the decrease in AER and changes in GFR or blood pressure. In the normotensive patient with diabetic nephropathy, captopril causes an acute reduction of AER, which is probably mediated by a lowering of the intraglomerular pressure.", 
    "401": "One hundred thirteen patients with essential hypertension receiving single or multiple antihypertensive agents were enrolled in the study. All had had mild to severe hypertension before treatment, but their diastolic blood pressure (DBP) at study entry was lower than 90 mm Hg for all measurements. In half of the subjects, non-thiazide diuretics (n = 35) or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI, n = 37) were discontinued, and their remaining drugs were maintained throughout the study. The other patients (n = 41) continued all their medications. Forty-one percent of subjects remained normotensive for 12 months after withdrawal of diuretics, and 37% of patients with ACEI discontinuation remained normotensive, although the recurrence of hypertension after withdrawal of ACEI tended to be earlier than its recurrence after withdrawal of diuretics. Serum uric acid and creatinine concentration decreased after diuretic withdrawal, but not after ACEI withdrawal. Diuretic withdrawal resulted in an increase in serum potassium, but ACEI withdrawal induced a decrease in serum potassium. Withdrawal of diuretics or ACEI both significantly reduced plasma renin activity. The present study may be indicative of the ability to withdraw some medications in many patients being treated with multiple antihypertensive agents.",

We found that diabetes increased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (inulin clearance, 2.3 +/- 0.5 ml/min vs 1.9 +/- 0.1 ml/min; p < 0.05) and blood pressure (137 +/- 15 mm Hg vs 116 +/- 6 mm Hg; p < 0.05) but did not increase plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) values, when compared with control rats (72 +/- 38 vs 68 +/- 24 pg/ml). CEI decreased GFR and blood pressure to control values. In rats with diabetes and concomitantly reduced renal mass, hypertension, elevated ANP values, proteinuria, and glomerulosclerosis were prominent features. CEI was associated with reduced blood pressure (172 +/- 17 mm Hg vs 138 +/- 15 mm Hg; p < 0.05), without a concomitant decrease in GFR (1.1 +/- 0.1 ml/min vs 1.1 +/- 0.1 ml/min). Further, CEI reduced the elevated ANP values (140 +/- 34 pg/ml vs 66 +/- 19 pg/ml; p < 0.05) to those of control rats. CEI reduced proteinuria by 50% and ameliorated the histopathologic changes. In separate experiments, rats with 5/6th nephrectomy and hypertension but without diabetes were also found to have elevated ANP levels that decreased to control values with CEI. The data speak for a renal protective effect of angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibition in this model but do not support a specific role for ANP in the model of diabetes with concomitantly reduced renal mass.",

In rats treated 6 days before and for 14 days after injury, perindopril significantly reduced (-76%, p < 0.01) myointimal hyperplasia. In contrast, DuP 753 at 5 mg.kg-1 x day-1 did not modify the hyperplastic response to balloon catheterization. Only at 30 mg.kg-1 x day-1 was DuP 753 able to reduce neointima formation (-47%, p < 0.05). This dose was equipotent to perindopril on the renin-angiotensin system as assessed by the pressor response to angiotensin II and angiotensin I. Therefore, blockade of subtype 1 receptors was a less effective means of suppression of myointimal growth than angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition, suggesting that another angiotensin receptor subtype or converting enzyme substrates are involved in this process. For the determination of whether angiotensin subtype 2 receptors were implicated, the specific subtype 2 receptor antagonist CGP 42112A (1 mg.kg-1 x day-1) was continuously infused perivascularly for 14 days in the vicinity of the injured carotid artery.

Plaque regression is a function of the dynamic balance among initiation, progression, stabilization, and removal of plaque constituents. Pseudoregression, the result of the triad thrombolysis, age- or lesion-dependent arterial dilatation, and relaxation of vasospasm, may readily give rise to angiographic misinterpretation. Although lowering of plasma cholesterol and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol has demonstrated significant clinical benefits in a number of clinical trials, the magnitude of angiographic regressive changes is relatively small despite aggressive lipid-lowering regimens. The emerging need for alternative or complementary therapeutic interventions has been emphasized. In particular, they should be targeted to pivotal cellular or molecular mechanisms in initiation, progression, or stabilization. Potentially important therapeutic targets include the use of antioxidants or free radical scavengers such as Probucol or its analogues, butylated hydroxytoluene, tocopherols, and possibly the tocotrienols. Other therapeutic targets include intimal monocyte-macrophage recruitment, macrophage cholesterol acyltransferase inhibition, stimulation of the high density lipoprotein-mediated reverse cholesterol transport system, smooth muscle cell migration to and proliferation in the arterial intima, and intimal connective tissue synthesis. Whether the isoprenylated proteins associated with the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway will give rise to compounds regulating smooth muscle cell growth has yet to be determined. Because of the importance of thrombosis in the pathogenesis and progression of lesions, the need to develop interventional strategies targeted at endothelial cell thromboresistance and thromboregulation must assume a high priority in future research and development.

In addition, oral captopril was administered in separate groups of control and experimental rats to establish whether a relation existed between attenuation of ventricular loading and magnitude of DNA synthesis in myocytes. Results demonstrated that left ventricular failure and right ventricular dysfunction at 7 days after infarction were biventricularly associated with marked increases in the number of myocyte nuclei in the G2M phase of the cell cycle. In contrast, the fraction of nuclei in the G0+G1 phase decreased. In comparison with the earlier time point, the 30-day interval was characterized by a significant magnitude of cardiac hypertrophy, a moderate amelioration of ventricular pump function, and a decrease in the percentage of myocyte nuclei in the G2M phase in both ventricles. However, 30 days after infarction, the number of right ventricular myocyte nuclei in the S and G2M phases remained elevated with respect to control animals. Captopril therapy reduced the extent of ventricular loading and the population of myocyte nuclei in the cell cycle at 7 days. In conclusion, DNA synthesis in myocyte nuclei may represent an important adaptive component of the myocardial response to infarction.",

The patients in the delapril group took delapril 7.5 mg twice a day for 2 weeks. If the antihypertensive effect was inadequate, the dose was increased to 15mg twice a day, and then to 30mg twice a day. The period of delapril treatment was 12 weeks. The patients in the captopril group took captopril 25 mg twice a day or three times a day for 12 weeks.

The pulse rates in both groups showed no significant changes after treatment. The laboratory data in both groups showed few changes after treatment.

Inhibitors of neutral endopeptidase will cause an accumulation of endogenous atrial natriuretic peptide, and hence lower blood pressure by counteracting several effects of the renin-angiotensin-system. Potassium channel openers are vasodilators and potential antihypertensive drugs with additional anti-ischaemic activity.",

Beta-adrenergic blockers reduce subsequent cardiovascular morbidity and mortality through their effect on the myocardial supply-demand balance.

Aspirin and other anticoagulants are beneficial through their antiplatelet effects. Cardiac rehabilitation methods and aggressive management of lipids levels are also useful.", 
    "422": "The current experiments were designed to explore the relationship between the renin angiotensin system (RAS) and prostanoid formation in aortic ring preparations from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). A further aim was to examine the mechanisms responsible for the reversal of the impaired acetylcholine (ACh) mediated relaxation induced by chronic administration of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril and the relationship of the ACh response to blood pressure. Rats were administered captopril (100 mg/kg/day) and their blood pressures monitored from 5 to 17 weeks of age. ACh-mediated relaxation was determined in aortic ring preparations from untreated and treated rats, and drug withdrawn rats. The influence of indomethacin, saralasin, SQ29548 and captopril on ACh-mediated responses was determined. It was found that chronic captopril treatment produced a marked suppression of the development of hypertension in the SHR. After the withdrawal of the drug the blood pressure remained significantly lower than in untreated animals for 4 weeks. ACh relaxation was impaired in SHR ring segments; this was reversed with captopril treatment and returned to the impaired state upon withdrawal of the drug. In vitro inhibition of the RAS did not significantly influence ACh relaxation. In contrast, impairment of the prostanoid system in vitro reversed the impaired relaxation. The results suggest that the influence of captopril on enhancing ACh relaxation in the SHR does not involve an acute interaction of local angiotensin II synthesis with prostanoid mechanisms. Importantly, the results highlight a dissociation between the impaired ACh relaxation and elevated blood pressure in the SHR.",

Local production of active renin and angiotensin II was closely correlated with circulating renin levels, suggesting that this vascular tissue renin-angiotensin system is at least partly dependent on uptake of renin from the circulating renin-angiotensin system. The local active renin and angiotensin II production was rapidly exhausted; this might represent a short-term control mechanism. Locally generated angiotensin II increased sympathetic vasoconstriction through the presynaptic release of noradrenaline and this effect was mediated by beta-adrenoceptor stimulation. Infusions of adenosine promoted the release of active renin and angiotensin II from the forearm and the coronary vessels.",

All components of the renin-angiotensin system have been found in important cardiovascular structures, including the heart, vessels, brain, kidney and adrenal gland. The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is the final step in the enzymatic cascade of the renin-angiotensin system, which converts angiotensin in both the circulation and the tissues.", 
    "441": "ACE is predominantly an ectoenzyme with a bilobed homodimer extracellular portion, a short transmembrane span and a small intracellular extension. ACE contains two catalytic sites, one on each lobe. There is evidence that these catalytic sites may differ in several properties and may have different conformational requirements. This raises the possibility that there may be different endogenous substrates for each site and it may be feasible to design more specific ACE inhibitors that inhibit only one catalytic site. CARDIOVASCULAR ROLE OF LOCAL RENIN-ANGIOTENSIN SYSTEM: The physiological cardiovascular functions of the tissue renin-angiotensin system may include regulation of regional blood flow, modulation of local sympathetic activity and interaction with the endothelium. There is increasing evidence that the local renin-angiotensin system may be involved in the maintenance of cardiovascular structure and repair. ACE is increased in many forms of vascular and cardiac hypertrophy and the administration of ACE inhibitors has led to regression of hypertrophy. Many of the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors may be due to inhibition of the local renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "442": "The local renin-angiotensin system may also be involved in the response to injury and in the inflammatory response. ACE is known to be increased in granulomas, it is expressed on monocytic macrophages and fibroblasts and many of the peptides involved in the inflammatory response (bradykinin, substance P, enkephalins) can act as ACE substrates. Following an acute myocardial infarct, ACE is increased in the myocardial scar and in the hypertrophying cardiac muscle. This provides a possible mechanism for the beneficial effect of ACE inhibitors in postmyocardial infarction trials. NON-CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: Neither the function of the renin-angiotensin system in the brain and non-cardiovascular tissues nor its role in the pathophysiology of hypertension are known as yet.", 
    "443": "Our study attempted to evaluate the importance of changes in the circulating renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and in hemodynamics in relation to observed changes in cardiovascular structure. We studied previously untreated men (n = 28) with essential nonmalignant hypertension and a supine casual diastolic blood pressure > 95 mm Hg on three to four separate (> 1-week interval) occasions measured in triplicate. We used intraarterial blood pressure, dye-dilution technique, plethysmography (hands), eye-ground photos, M-mode echocardiography, radio immunoassays, and multiple regression analysis. Patients were randomized to 6 months of double-blind treatment with either enalapril or hydrochlorothiazide, following 4 to 6 weeks on placebo. We found that enalapril blocked the plasma angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) with a secondary increment in plasma renin activity (PRA) and reductions in angiotensin II (AII) and aldosterone. Blood pressure was lowered through a reduction in total peripheral resistance (TPR). Hydrochlorothiazide increased PRA, AII, and aldosterone, and lowered blood pressure mainly through a reduction in cardiac output. Enalapril was significantly more effective than hydrochlorothiazide in reversing structural changes in the retinal and hand vasculature as well as in the heart. A reduction in cardiac hypertrophy was seen even in the occasional enalapril-treated patient, in whom little or no reduction in blood pressure occurred. In the stepwise regression analyses, the changes in retinal and hand vascular structure were most strongly related to various changes in the RAAS, explaining 15 to 34% of the variance. For the changes in cardiac structure, the type of therapy (enalapril or hydrochlorothiazide) appeared to be the most important factor, explaining between 29 and 50% of the variance. The changes in cardiac structure were even more strongly related to changes in the RAAS for the enalapril treated patients and explained up to 55% of the variance in cardiac structure. It can be concluded that the reversal of structural vascular changes during antihypertensive therapy was more dependent on the blockade of the RAAS than on lowering of the blood pressure.", 
    "444": "Hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) have increased prevalence of ventricular arrhythmias. Slow conduction velocity at the level of hypertrophic myocardial cells has been one of the postulated mechanisms for these arrhythmias. To assess the effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition on modification in ventricular conduction velocities, we studied 25 hypertensive patients with LVH using signal averaged electrocardiography (SAECG) in a randomized double-blind placebo controlled and cross-over trial. Data were acquired at baseline and 10 min after a double-blind intravenous infusion of saline placebo or 2.5 mg enalaprilat. Sequential cross-over was done the next day. Root mean square vector was 55 +/- 5 microV at baseline, 55 +/- 5 microV after placebo and 54 +/- 4 microV after enalaprilat (P = NS). Low amplitude signal < 40 msec was 45 +/- 4 msec at baseline, 45 +/- 4 msec after placebo, and 43 +/- 4 msec after enalaprilat (P = NS). There was no change in filtered QRS (fQRS) duration between baseline (113 +/- 10 msec) and placebo (113 +/- 11 msec) measurements. However, after enalaprilat infusion, there was a significant reduction in fQRS to 106 +/- 7 msec (P = .04), and five patients (20%) with late potentials had normalization of this feature (P = .001). The data suggest that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition with enalaprilat reduces conduction velocity delay in hypertensive patients with LVH.", 
    "445": "The hemodynamic effects of long-term (3 months) treatment with enalapril, a potent angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, were studied in 12 randomly selected patients with portal hypertension and a previous episode of hemorrhage from esophageal varices. All these patients underwent injection sclerotherapy of varices at 1-week intervals. As a control group 13 patients treated only with injection sclerotherapy and placebo were used. After 3 months the wedged hepatic venous pressure (25.5 +/- 4.8 vs. 21.3 +/- 4.8 mmHg) and the non-wedged hepatic venous pressure gradient (17.0 +/- 6.0 vs. 12.6 +/- 3.4 mmHg) were significantly lower than the basal values (p < 0.01) in the group treated with enalapril. A large decrease (> 3 mmHg) in these pressures was observed only in 50% of the patients. In the group treated with sclerotherapy+placebo this pressure reduction was not observed. Systemic hemodynamics and liver function tests did not change during the treatment. None of our patients died during the study or the next 6 months. We conclude that enalapril lowers portal pressure in patients with portal hypertension, although not in all of them, and may be used to good effect to manage patients with esophageal varices in combination with sclerotherapy.", 
    "446": "After exposure of bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells in culture to 1 microM dexamethasone for 24-48 h, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity of these cells was elevated severalfold. The increase in ACE activity was preceded by an increase in ACE mRNA, which could be detected after treatment of cells with dexamethasone for 4 h. When the increase in ACE mRNA produced by dexamethasone at 4 h was blocked by alpha-amanitin, an RNA polymerase II inhibitor, the increase in ACE activity detected at 48 h was inhibited. RU 38486, a steroid receptor antagonist, inhibited the elevation of both ACE activity and mRNA produced by dexamethasone. Among other steroids tested, only hydrocortisone, aldosterone and corticosterone-21-acetate had a stimulatory effect on ACE activity. RU 38486 effectively blocked the elevation in ACE activity produced by both aldosterone and dexamethasone, but had no effect on the elevation of ACE activity produced by other agents (3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, A23187, and dibutyryl adenosine 3',5' cyclic monophosphate). From these data we conclude that dexamethasone and certain other steroids with an hydroxyl group in the 11th carbon position regulate ACE gene expression of bovine endothelial cells at the transcriptional level via a steroid receptor-mediated mechanism.", 
    "447": "1. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors have been demonstrated to be effective in the treatment of cardiac hypertrophy when used in antihypertensive doses. The aim of our one year study with an ACE-inhibitor in rats was to separate local cardiac effects produced by a non-antihypertensive dose from those on systemic blood pressure when an antihypertensive dose was used. 2. Rats made hypertensive by aortic banding were subjected to chronic oral treatment for one year with an antihypertensive dose of the ACE inhibitor, ramipril 1 mg kg-1 daily, (RA 1 mg) or received a low dose of 10 micrograms kg-1 daily (RA 10 micrograms) which did not affect high blood pressure. 3. Chronic treatment with the ACE-inhibitor prevented left ventricular hypertrophy in the antihypertensive rats as did the low dose which had no effects on blood pressure. Similar effects were observed on myocardial fibrosis. Plasma ACE activity was inhibited in the RA 1 mg but not in the RA 10 micrograms group although conversion of angiotensin (Ang) I to Ang II in isolated aortic strips was suppressed in both treated groups. Plasma catecholamines were increased in the untreated control group, but treatment with either dose of ramipril normalized the values. The myocardial phosphocreatine to ATP ratio (an indicator of the energy state in the heart) was reduced in the vehicle control group whereas the hearts from treated animals showed a normal ratio comparable to hearts from sham-operated animals. 4. After one year, five animals were separated from each group, treatment withdrawn, and housed for additional six months. In the RA 1 mg group, blood pressure did not reach the value of the control vehicle group and surprisingly, left ventricular hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis did not recur in animals during withdrawal of treatment.5. These data show that long term ACE inhibitor treatment with ramipril in antihypertensive and non-antihypertensive doses prevented cardiac hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis. This protective effect was still present after 6 months treatment withdrawal.", 
    "448": "Any treatment used in pregnant women must take into account the effects of the substance in question of the fetus and the particular sensitivity of the latter during the first three months of development. The majority of drugs used in cardiology can be prescribed during pregnancy: digitalis preparations, furosemide, certain beta-blockers, verapamil, nifedipine (except during the first three months), quinidine, disopyramide, lignocaine, flecainide, amiodarone, heparins (non-fragmented and low molecular weight), central antihypertensive agents, dipyridamole and aspirin. In contrast, some drugs should be avoided because of insufficient information regarding their maternal and fetal consequences (bumetamide, modamide, the most recent beta-blockers, cibenzoline, ticlopidine) or because of harmful adverse effects on the fetus (spironolactones, bipyridines, diltiazem) or the newborn infant (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors). Finally, with certain medications (propafenone, oral anticoagulants), it is important to be able to compare maternal risks due to the disease and fetal risks induced by the drug. Modification of the conditions of use of these drugs and very careful monitoring of the patient most often suffice to avoid untoward events or complications with potentially serious medicolegal consequences and which may implicate the liability of the prescriber.",

Hemodynamic measurements were obtained by a triple lumen 7 F Swan-Ganz catheter, inserted into the pulmonary artery, under control conditions and 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 hours after 10 mg (15 patients) and 20 mg (11 patients) of the drug. Ten milligrams of enalapril reduced systolic and mean arterial blood pressure (from 118 +/- 17 to 111 +/- 18 mmHg, p < .05, and from 92 +/- 12 to 83 +/- 12 mmHg, p < .01, respectively), with a maximum effect after 4 hours from administration. Heart rate and vascular resistances showed an insignificant trend toward reduction, and no changes were observed in left ventricular systolic work index, right and left ventricular filling pressures or cardiac index. Hemodynamic changes induced by 20 mg of the drug, in a smaller group of patients, had a similar trend, which did not reach a statistical significance. In conclusion, in patients with acute uncomplicated myocardial infarction, a single oral dose of enalapril maleate is safe and well tolerated, does not induce severe hypotension, and produces potentially beneficial changes in hemodynamics.",

Office BP, heart rate and side effects were assessed during the run-in period on placebo, and after 2, 4 and 8 weeks' treatment. Blood pressure and heart rate were measured at the same time at each visit, 12 hours after the last captopril dose and 24 hours after the last amlodipine dose. At the end of the 8 week study, the reduction in sitting DBP was significantly greater (P = 0.002) with amlodipine. Ambulatory BP recordings were performed over a 24-hour period, at baseline and at the end of the study. Both treatment regimes significantly reduced clinic BP without affecting heart rate. However, amlodipine reduced ambulatory systolic (SBP) and DBP almost every hour over the whole circadian cycle, whereas the antihypertensive effect of captopril was attenuated during the final 3 hours of each dosing interval. The incidence of headache and peripheral oedema was identical between the two regimens. Only one patient taking amlodipine withdrew due to ankle swelling. This study demonstrates that the once-daily administration of amlodipine has a more sustained antihypertensive effect than does captopril taken twice daily.", 
    "454": "Both conventional direct current (DC) and pulsed-mode DC constant-current iontophoresis were used to investigate enhanced transdermal delivery of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril to rabbits with acutely induced hypertension. Passive transdermal captopril administration and pulsed DC constant-current iontophoresis of the vehicle were studied as control experimentation. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was not significantly (p > 0.05) altered following passive transdermal delivery of captopril (n = 4) or after iontophoretic delivery of the vehicle alone (n = 4). Pressure reduction was evident within 10 minutes of iontophoretic enhancement of transdermal captopril delivery. DC mode constant-current (n = 4) iontophoretic transdermal captopril administration caused MAP to fall by 21% from a mean hypertensive level of 66 +/- 5 mmHg to a mean post-treatment level of 52 +/- 6 mmHg (p < 0.05) within 60 minutes. Pulsed DC mode constant-current (n = 4) iontophoresis of captopril caused mean MAP to fall on average by 27% from 62 +/- 6 to 45 +/- 5 mmHg (p < 0.05), also within 60 minutes. This paper provides the first report on the enhanced efficiency during iontophoretic delivery of an ACE inhibitor. We have concluded that both modes of constant-current iontophoresis of captopril offer a safe and effective means of pressure reduction in rabbits with induced hypertension and that there is no significant difference in efficacy between the two forms of enhanced delivery. These results have potential applications for enhanced transdermal delivery of ACE inhibitors in humans.",

    "456": "Survey of data from recent studies. DISCREPANCY BETWEEN BLOOD PRESSURE REDUCTION INDUCED BY ACE INHIBITORS AND PLASMA ANG II LEVELS: Studies on the effects of ACE inhibition in hypertensive subjects have suggested that with chronic ACE inhibitor treatment, blood pressure remains lowered even when plasma Ang II returns to normal. However, this discrepancy may be largely an artefact related to difficulties in measuring low Ang II levels in the presence of high angiotensin I (Ang I) levels. Even with modern sensitive and specific Ang II assays it can be difficult to monitor in vivo ACE inhibition (Ang II:I ratio in plasma) because of ex vivo Ang II formation. Recently, in measuring 24-h blood pressure responses to ACE inhibitor treatment, we have obtained good correlations between the time-course of the blood pressure response and the change in circulating Ang II. PROBLEMS IN MEASURING RENIN ACTIVITY: Routine assays of renin activity in plasma can lead to an overestimate of the degree of in vivo inhibition during renin inhibitor treatment, because some protease inhibitors that are used in these assays can cause an ex vivo displacement of protein-bound renin inhibitor, thereby increasing its free concentration. This must be taken into account when using the ratio of enzymatically active renin to immunoreactive renin as an index of in vivo renin inhibition. BLOOD PRESSURE RESPONSE AND ANG II LEVELS WITH RENIN INHIBITORS AND ANG II ANTAGONISTS: Results published so far seem to indicate that with these drugs, as with the ACE inhibitors, the magnitude of the blood pressure effect is correlated with the decrease in the 'effective' Ang II concentration at the receptor sites. However, the time-course of the two effects may be different; with the renin inhibitors, the maximum effect on pressure was delayed compared with the effect on Ang II.", 
    "457": "Further studies are needed to establish the exact time-course of renin and Ang II changes and their relationship to blood pressure. Only with rigorously controlled assays will it be possible to answer the question whether, for a given change in 'effective' Ang II concentration at the receptor sites, the effect on blood pressure is different with the three classes of anti-renin-angiotensin drugs.",

    "459": "Basis of pharmacological blood pressure reduction: Since the discovery of the renin-angiotensin system by Tigerstedt almost 100 years ago, a large number of vasoactive peptides have been discovered. By interaction with such peptides of endocrine, perivascular or endothelial origin, blood pressure may be modulated. BLOCKADE OF THE RENIN-ANGIOTENSIN SYSTEM: The success of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in hypertension and congestive heart failure is generally attributed to reduced generation of angiotensin II. The recent development of specific and highly potent Ang II type 1 subtype receptor antagonists such as losartan (DuP753, MK954) have provided a new opportunity to inhibit the renin-angiotensin system, and this is currently being explored in hypertensive patients. In addition, blockade of the first and rate-limiting reaction of the renin-angiotensin system, inhibition of renin activity, is also a target for the development of antihypertensive drugs. However, this development is hampered at present by a compensatory increase in active renin that clinically offsets the antihypertensive action of renin inhibitors. PHARMACOLOGICALLY INDUCED INCREASE IN ATRIAL NATRIURETIC PEPTIDE (ANP): The availability of circulating or tissue ANP may be increased by inhibiting its metabolic clearance by NEP-24.11 inhibitor drugs. These agents induce a reduction in blood pressure and diuretic effects in animal models, and may become a new class of drugs for the clinical management of patients with hypertension and congestive heart failure. OTHER POTENTIAL PHARMACOLOGICAL TARGETS IN THE MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION: There are several potential pharmacological targets that may lead to the development of novel antihypertensive agents in the future. These include the interaction or blockade of vasopressor peptides. Routes of development include neuropeptide Y1 receptor antagonists, which block the postjunctional vasopressor effect of neuropeptide Y, or endothelin antagonists, which block endothelin pressor actions at the endothelin A receptor site. The cardiovascular actions of the functional neuropeptide Y inhibitor alpha-trinositol (PP 56) provide a potential new mechanism for reducing blood pressure in hypertension. In addition, the recent discovery of small molecular agents with high potency and specificity for the endothelin A receptor subtype may also be of value in specific vascular disease states.",

It is now being evaluated as an anti-hypertensive drug in multicenter clinical trials in the United States and other countries. Preliminary inpatient studies have shown that after 5 days of treatment, losartan--in doses of 50, 100, and 150 mg--is significantly more effective than placebo in decreasing blood pressure, and has efficacy similar to that of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril. Large-scale dose-ranging studies in ambulatory hypertensive patients have shown that 10- and 25-mg losartan doses have brief effects in lowering blood pressure, but when given once daily, 50 mg is the minimal dose needed to produce significant day-long decreases in blood pressure. Interestingly, higher doses do not appear to exhibit greater efficacy; however, the effects of these doses are all similar to those of enalapril (20 mg once daily). Losartan's long duration of action is documented by ratios of trough (end of 24-h dosing interval) to peak antihypertensive effects, which are consistently above 50%. Clinical experiences thus far have indicated a low incidence of adverse events. Preliminary animal and in vitro investigations have shown that losartan produces beneficial effects on cardiac function, renal function, and survival that are similar to those of ACE inhibitors.

Common combinations in clinical practice are a beta-blocker plus a diuretic, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor plus a diuretic, a beta-blocker plus a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, and an ACE inhibitor plus a calcium antagonist. Since both ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists are metabolically inert and exert favorable effects on target organ disease, their combination is of particular interest. When combined, these two drug classes have additive effects on antihypertensive efficacy, reduction of left ventricular hypertrophy, and protection of the renal circulation. However, whether or not these favorable pathophysiologic changes induced with combination therapy of ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists will translate into a reduction of morbidity and mortality remains to be documented.", 
    "463": "The acute and subacute toxicities of N-[8-amino-1(S)-carboxyoctyl]-L- alanyl-L-proline (AB-47, CAS 120008-53-9), which is a non-sulfhydryl angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, were studied in male and female Fischer 344 rats. In the acute study, male and female rats were orally given 5000 mg/kg of AB-47. No rats were dead during the observation period (14 days) after the administration. The LD50 values of AB-47 were more than 5000 mg/kg in both male and female rats. Although only diarrhoea as toxic sign was observed 2 to 7 h after the administration, this sign disappeared within 24 h after the administration. Necropsy at the termination of observations revealed no macroscopic lesions in any rats. In the subacute study, male and female Fischer 344 rats were orally given 40, 200 or 1000 mg/kg/d of AB-47 for 4 weeks. Neither toxic signs nor death due to drug effects were observed at any dosage levels of AB-47. Furthermore, AB-47 did not influence body weight, food consumption, food efficiency, urinalytical and hematological parameters in both male and female rats. The minor changes of serum parameters, which consisted of very slight increases in serum potassium and decreases in serum albumin/globulin ratio, occurred in male rats given 200 and 1000 mg/kg/d of AB-47. Serum urea nitrogen values were elevated in both male and female rats given 1000 mg/kg/d of AB-47. Slight decreases of heart weight and heart weight/body weight ratios were observed at all dosage levels of AB-47.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "464": "We have examined the effects of local intra-arterial infusion of enalaprilat (an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor) on responses initiated by concomitantly infused acetylcholine (an endothelium-dependent vasodilator) and sodium nitroprusside (a direct dilator of smooth muscle) in the forearm arterial beds of healthy volunteers. Although the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor alone did not affect basal forearm blood flow or vascular resistance, it significantly augmented the increase in blood flow and reduction in vascular resistance induced by acetylcholine (both p < 0.05). Coinfusion of enalaprilat did not enhance sodium nitroprusside-induced vasodilation. Pretreatment with NG-monomethyl-L-arginine blocked the augmentation of blood flow induced by the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. The effect of enalaprilat was still observed after the administration of acetylsalicylic acid (p < 0.05). These results suggest that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors potentiate nonprostanoid endothelium-derived relaxing factor in normal human forearm vasculature.", 
    "465": "Renin inhibitors are an alternative means of blockade of circulating and tissue-based renin-angiotensin systems (RAS). We studied a new renin inhibitor, Ro 42-5892, by low-dose (0.1 mg/kg) intravenous (i.v.) infusion in 10 min (fast) or 6 h (slow) or placebo in a double-blind cross-over study to assess the relationship between drug concentration and response. Fasting salt-replete normotensive male volunteers (n = 9) aged 18-32 years were studied supine. There were no significant changes in blood pressure (BP) or heart rate (HR) between drug and placebo infusion. Drug concentration peaked (482 +/- 140 ng/ml) at the end of the fast infusion or showed a sustained plateau (25.9 +/- 6.1 ng/ml) with the slow infusion (mean time to peak 121 +/- 99 min). Both fast (135.2 +/- 26 ng/ml/h2) and slow (121.0 +/- 31.1 ng/ml/h2) infusions had similar area under the curve (AUC)0-24-values. Plasma renin activity (PRA) was dramatically reduced by both strategies, but AUC0-10 for PRA was significantly less for slow (1.7 +/- 0.6 ngAI/ml/h2) than fast (4.9 +/- 2.5 ngAI/ml/h2) infusions. Mean peak plasma active renin (AR) concentration was increased by both fast (102.2 +/- 65.9 pg/ml) and slow (195.2 +/- 110.5 pg/ml) infusions as compared with placebo (49.9 +/- 18.6 pg/ml). Similarly, AUC0-10 for AR was greater for slow (990.2 +/- 582.1 pg/ml/h) than fast (512.4 +/- 189.4 pg/ml/h) infusions. Plasma angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity was unaltered. Our results indicate that protracted low concentrations of Ro 42-5892 may provide more effective and long-lasting inhibition of renin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "466": "Control of mitochondrial ATP synthase capacity was investigated in cultured cardiomyocytes from normotensive (Wistar-Kyoto) and spontaneously hypertensive rats. Cells from spontaneously hypertensive rats have a higher basal ATP synthase capacity than those from normotensives, but lack the normal up-regulation in response to an increased energy demand. After treatment of spontaneously hypertensive rats with captopril (60 mg/kg per day for 12 weeks), cellular hypertrophy characteristic of the hypertensives was abolished and the cardiomyocytes showed a normal ATP synthase capacity. Normal up-regulation of this enzyme was also restored. All cells showed a normal down-regulation of the synthase in response to cyanide. Experiments with the calcium antagonists, verapamil and ruthenium red, suggest that abnormal ATP synthase regulation observed in the untreated spontaneously hypertensive rats results from an alteration of Ca2+ handling in cardiac cells under chronic high workload, which is reversed by captopril treatment.", 
    "467": "The S-nitroso derivatives of captopril can act as an inhibitor of an angiotensin-converting enzyme in the presence of thiol such as glutathione. S-Nitrosocaptopril also rapidly transfers its nitroso moiety to a heme protein, which is presumably the responsible mechanism for the activation of guanylate cyclase. These results suggest that S-nitrosocaptopril may serve as an effective hypotensive agent.", 
    "468": "Today, essential hypertension is considered to be genetically closely related to disordered peripheral glucose metabolism, and this situation is described by the term metabolic syndrome. Both diseases--hypertension and type II diabetes--submit the heart and arterial vessels to an unphysiological, chronic stress, which they can compensate only for a certain time. Today, when antihypertensive treatment is indicated, drugs capable of preventing late vascular injury while at the same time having the potency to reverse already existing organic changes, are employed. ACE-inhibitors are presently considered to be the most potent substances that are capable of exerting a positive effect on hypertension-associated changes, while not increasing the individual risk profile in the development of arteriosclerosis. The present paper discusses the new ACE-inhibitor, cilazapril, which can be administered in a practical single dose and develops a profile of action typical of ACE-inhibitors in hypertensives with and without an accompanying metabolic syndrome.", 
    "469": "To evaluate the therapeutic potential of organic nitrates in patients with chronic congestive heart (CHF) failure already treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, the temporal hemodynamic effects of oral isosorbide dinitrate, 40 to 120 mg administered every 6 hours to 11 nitrate responders who had been treated with captopril 89 +/- 32 mg/day, were studied. The administration of isosorbide dinitrate resulted in a significant decline in mean right atrial pressure, from 13 +/- 6 mm Hg at baseline (mean value of measurements performed every 2 hours for 24 hours with captopril therapy) to 9 +/- 4 mm Hg at 1 hour with persistent effect for most of the study period. Mean pulmonary artery pressure decreased from 38 +/- 7 mm Hg at baseline to 29 +/- 9 mm Hg at 1 hour, with effect persisting for 24 hours. Mean pulmonary artery wedge pressure also decreased from 24 +/- 6 to 15 +/- 7 mm Hg at 1 hour and remained significantly reduced for 20 hours. Systemic blood pressure demonstrated a transient decrease lasting 2 hours after initiation of therapy which was asymptomatic in all patients. The results of this study demonstrate a preserved vasodilatory effect of organic nitrates in patients already treated with ACE inhibitors. Nitrates mediated improvement in right and left ventricular filling pressures, and reduction of pulmonary hypertension demonstrates a rationale for the use of these therapeutic methods in combination and suggest the need for long-term evaluation of the effect of nitrate therapy in patients with chronic CHF already treated with ACE inhibitors.", 
    "470": "The benefit of antihypertensive therapy in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality associated with isolated systolic hypertension has now been established by the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program. However, there is little information about the relative effectiveness of different drug regimens in this condition. This study compared the efficacy and tolerability of 50 mg of atenolol, 10 mg of enalapril, 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide and 2.5 mg of isradipine in the treatment of isolated systolic hypertension. After a 3-week placebo run-in phase, 24 subjects were randomized into a 4-period double-blind crossover study by use of an orthogonal latin square design. Treatment periods were of 6 weeks' duration with titration to a higher dose after 4 weeks in those not reaching goal blood pressure (BP). Each active treatment was followed by a 3-week placebo washout. Casual clinic and 24-hour ambulatory BP (Accutracker II) were measured at the end of each treatment phase. Routine biochemistry was also performed after the placebo run-in, at the end of each active treatment phase, and after the placebo run-out. Of the 24 subjects entered (mean age 72.3 years, 38% men) 20 completed the whole study. Mean +/- standard deviation of supine clinic and daytime ambulatory BP on entry were 181/79 +/- 21/9 mm Hg and 165/82 +/- 23/15 mm Hg, respectively. All drugs reduced mean casual and ambulatory BP significantly relative to placebo but only hydrochlorothiazide and enalapril produced a consistent hypotensive effect throughout the entire 24-hour period. Isradipine and enalapril exhibited a relatively greater effect on reducing systolic BP than either hydrochlorothiazide or atenolol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "471": "An association between raised renin levels and myocardial infarction has been reported. We studied the effects of enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, on the development of myocardial infarction and unstable angina in 6797 patients with ejection fractions < or = 0.35 enrolled into the two Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD) trials. Patients were randomly assigned to placebo (n = 3401) or enalapril (n = 3396) at doses of 2.5-20 mg per day in two concurrent double-blind trials with the same protocol. Patients with heart failure entered the treatment trial (n = 2569) and those without heart failure entered the prevention trial (n = 4228). Follow-up averaged 40 months. In each trial there were significant reductions in the number of patients developing myocardial infarction (treatment trial: 158 placebo vs 127 enalapril, p < 0.02; prevention trial: 204 vs 161 p < 0.01) or unstable angina (240 vs 187 p < 0.001; 355 vs 312, p < 0.05). Combined, there were 362 placebo group patients with myocardial infarction compared with 288 in the enalapril group (risk reduction 23%, 95% CI 11-34%; p < 0.001). 595 placebo group patients developed unstable angina compared with 499 in the enalapril group (risk reduction 20%, 95% CI 9-29%, p < 0.001). There was also a reduction in cardiac deaths (711 placebo, 615 enalapril; p < 0.003), so that the reduction in the combined endpoint of deaths, myocardial infarction, and unstable angina was highly significant (20% risk reduction, 95% CI 14-26%; p < 0.0001). Enalapril treatment significantly reduced myocardial infarction, unstable angina, and cardiac mortality in patients with low ejection fractions.", 
    "472": "Treatment with an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor can result in acute renal failure in patients with a renal artery stenosis.

All three agents resulted in dose-dependent reductions in mean arterial pressure (MAP), glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and RBF. The maximum responses to captopril and SK&F 108566 were similar with MAP, RBF and GFR all decreasing approximately 30%. EXP3174 also resulted in decreases in GFR and RBF of approximately 30%; however, there was a smaller (approximately 17%) decrease in MAP. The data indicate that the possible bradykinin enhancing activity of ACE inhibitors may not provide any moderating activity of ACE inhibitor-induced reduction in GFR observed in dogs with a renal artery stenosis.",

Lisinopril was tolerated better than nifedipine, with fewer withdrawals. Adverse experiences reported after a general question on discomfort were significantly lower for lisinopril than for nifedipine. Questions referring specifically to symptoms revealed higher frequency of coughing with lisinopril, while flushing, edema, palpitations, dizziness, tiredness and rash were reported more frequently with nifedipine. Quality of life was similarly assessed by both patients and spouses. No significant differences in well-being during treatment were found for either drug, except in the case of the highest dose level of nifedipine, which caused a deterioration of well-being.", 
    "474": "In a Norwegian, double-blind, double-dummy multicenter study, 828 patients with mild to moderate hypertension were randomized to treatment by either lisinopril or nifedipine. One of the aims of the study was to specifically investigate the frequency of side effects. Spontaneously reported coughing reached 8.5% for lisinopril, as against 3.1% for nifedipine. In two patients coughing led to withdrawal from the study, and in another three it contributed partially to discontinuation of the treatment. A significant sex difference was found for spontaneously reported coughing among patients on lisinopril; 12.6% of the women and 4.4% of the men. A similar difference between the sexes was found for specific questioning about coughing. Use of a visual analogue scale by both patient and spouse revealed similar frequency of coughing as when reported spontaneously. The reason for sex being an important determinant for lisinopril-induced coughing remains obscure.",

In this paper, we refer to significant human studies, published during the last decade, concerning the degree of regression of these presumably secondary structural changes, resulting from antihypertensive treatment. It has been shown that most antihypertensive regimens in common use, calcium antagonists, ACE inhibitors and most beta blockers, but not diuretics and nonspecific vasodilators, are, when effective in lowering blood pressure, also capable of inducing a probably complete regression of the cardiac hypertrophy. However, complete regression of the vascular changes has not been shown.", 
    "476": "A rapid, simple and sensitive column-switching high-performance liquid chromatographic procedure for the determination of captopril in plasma and urine had been developed. p-Bromophenacyl bromide was used as a derivatizing reagent to react with captopril to form a product that showed ultraviolet-absorbing properties. For plasma samples the protein was removed with 6% perchloric acid before injection. The urine samples were directly injected into the chromatograph. The column-switching system was equipped with a pre-column (5 cm x 0.5 cm I.D.) packed with muBondapak C18 (37-50 microns) and an analytical column (15 cm x 0.5 cm I.D.) packed with YWG-C18, 10 microns. Impurities were washed from the pre-column with 0.2% acetic acid and the retained substances were eluted into the analytical column with acetonitrile-water-acetic acid (35:65:0.4, v/v). Captopril was detected at 260 nm. The calibration curve was linear in the range 20-1000 ng/ml for plasma and 10-200 micrograms/ml for urine. The recoveries averaged 103.2 and 99.5% for plasma and urine, respectively. The coefficients of variation were all less than 10%.", 
    "477": "The ability of centrally administered angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors to lower mean arterial pressure (MAP) has been demonstrated in numerous animal models of hypertension. In the present study, we assessed the effect of intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of the ACE inhibitor captopril (10 micrograms) on MAP in conscious, freely moving hypertensive inbred Dahl salt-sensitive (DS/JR) rats and their normotensive control inbred Dahl salt-resistant (DP/JR) rats. Both DS/JR and DR/JR rats were maintained on an 8% salt diet from 4 weeks of age until experimentation at 7-8 weeks of age, at which time DS/JR pressures were significantly elevated as compared to DR/JR rats (185 +/- 6 vs. 99 +/- 2 mm Hg, respectively). Following i.c.v. administration of captopril, a significant depressor response lasting for several hours was observed in DS/JR rats, with a maximum reduction of 17.6 +/- 4.1 mm Hg. The same treatment had no effect on the MAP of DR/JR rats. Mean arterial pressures in both groups were not significantly affected by i.c.v. administration of vehicle alone or by intravenous (i.v.) administration of 100 micrograms of captopril. These findings indicate that i.c.v. captopril lowers MAP in hypertensive DS/JR rats. Further studies will be necessary to elucidate the mechanism of this antihypertensive effect.", 
    "478": "The effects of modulators of cytochrome P450 and reduced glutathione (GSH) on the hepatotoxicity of enalapril maleate (EN) were investigated in Fischer 344 rats. Twenty-four hours following the administration of EN (1.5 to 1.8 g/kg), increased serum transaminases (ALT and AST) and hepatic necrosis were observed. Pretreatment of the animals with pregnenolone-16 alpha-carbonitrile, a selective inducer of the cytochrome P450IIIA gene subfamily, enhanced EN-induced hepatotoxicity, whereas pretreatment with the cytochrome P450 inhibitor, cobalt protoporphyrin, reduced the liver injury. Depletion of hepatic non-protein sulfhydryls (NPSHs), an indicator of GSH, by combined treatment with buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) and diethyl maleate (DEM) produced marked elevations in serum transaminases by 6 hr after EN treatment. Administered on its own, EN decreased hepatic NPSH content and when combined with the BSO/DEM pretreatment, the liver was nearly completely devoid of NPSHs. Protection from EN-induced hepatotoxicity was observed in animals administered L-2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid, a cysteine precursor. Together, these observations suggest the involvement of cytochrome P450 in EN bioactivation and GSH in detoxification. The results corroborate previous in vitro observations pertaining to the mechanism of EN-induced cytotoxicity towards primary cultures of rat hepatocytes. Although the doses of EN used in this study were far in excess of therapeutic doses, under certain circumstances, this metabolism-mediated toxicologic mechanism could form the basis for idiosyncratic liver injury in patients receiving EN therapy.", 
    "479": "The effects of a range of metallopeptidase inhibitors on the activities of the porcine kidney cell surface zinc aminopeptidases, aminopeptidase A (AP-A; EC 3.4.11.2), aminopeptidase N (AP-N; EC 3.4.11.7) and aminopeptidase W (AP-W; EC 3.4.11.16), have been directly compared. Amastatin and probestin were effective against all three aminopeptidases, with the concentration of inhibitor required to cause 50% inhibition (I50) in the low micromolar range (I50 = 1.5-20 microM), except for probestin with AP-N which displayed an I50 of 50 nM. Actinonin failed to inhibit significantly either AP-A or AP-W, and thus can be considered a relatively selective inhibitor (I50 = 2.0 microM) of AP-N. In contrast, bestatin was a relatively poor inhibitor of AP-N (I50 = 89 microM) and failed to inhibit AP-A, but was more potent towards AP-W (I50 = 7.9 microM). Thus, some of the observed chemotherapeutic actions of bestatin may be due to inhibition of cell-surface AP-W. A number of other metallopeptidase inhibitors, including inhibitors of endopeptidase-24.11 (EC 3.4.24.11) and membrane dipeptidase (EC 3.4.13.11), and the carboxylalkyl and phosphoryl inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme (EC 3.4.15.1) failed to inhibit significantly AP-A, AP-N or AP-W. However, AP-W was inhibited with I50 values in the micromolar range by the sulphydryl converting enzyme inhibitors rentiapril (I50 = 1.6 microM), zofenoprilat (I50 = 7.0 microM) and YS 980 (I50 = 17.7 microM). Neither AP-A nor AP-N were affected by these sulphydryl compounds. Inhibition of AP-W may account for some of the side effects noted with the clinical use of the sulphydryl converting enzyme inhibitors. The availability of compounds which are totally selective for AP-W over any of the other mammalian cell surface zinc aminopeptidases may aid in identifying endogenous substrates, and thus physiological or pathophysiological role(s) of AP-W.", 
    "480": "An active gelatinase has been purified from the conditioned medium of granulation tissue culture formed by carrageenin injection in rats. The purified gelatinase gave a single band corresponding to a M(r) of 57 kDa on both sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and SDS-gelatin PAGE. The granulation tissue-derived gelatinase selectively cleaved the Gln6-Phe7 bond of substance P (SP) with a Km of 0.17 mM and a Vmax of 0.027 nmol SP7-11/min/micrograms protein, resulting in the generation of biologically inactive fragments, SP1-6 and SP7-11. Our data suggest that the gelatinase produced by granulation tissue participates in the inactivation of SP in the inflammatory site.", 
    "481": "A multicentre investigation of antihypertensive treatment by perindopril was conducted in three centres of Czechoslovakia. The investigation comprised 51 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension (diastolic pressure 95-115 mmHg) who were taking perindopril for a period of three months, the initial dose being 4 mg (1 tablet per day). If the blood pressure did not drop to normal levels (dBP < 90 mmHg), the dose was increased to 8 mg after 1 month and if after 2 months of treatment the blood pressure did not reach normal levels, a thiazide diuretic was added. The antihypertensive effectiveness was assessed 24 hours after ingestion of the drug. The blood pressure declined significantly already after the first month of monotherapy with perindopril. It declined then significantly up to the end of the 3rd month of treatment. The systolic blood pressure declined by 9.4 mmHg after the first month of monotherapy with perindopril and by 15.9 mmHg after 3 months of treatment. The diastolic blood pressure declined by 8.1 mmHg after one month of monotherapy and by 12.4 mmHg at the end of three-month treatment. The clinical and biological tolerance was excellent and only one patient discontinued treatment for reasons not related to the administered drug. Twenty-four hour monitoring of the blood pressure also proved the favourable effect of perindopril.",

In the Emergency Department, the patient initially was misdiagnosed with bronchial asthma and, later, with early congestive heart failure, despite normal physical examination and investigations.

    "483": "1. AI and AII induced concentration-dependent contractions in cat femoral artery segments, the potency of AII being greater than that of AI. 2. The antagonist of AII receptors, saralasin (1 and 10 nM), inhibited the AI and AII responses. 3. Indomethacin (10 microM) and endothelium removal increased the responses to AII, whereas those induced by AI were barely affected. 4. The response induced by AI was reduced by captopril (200 microM). 5. These data suggest: (1) the contractions induced by AII are mediated by AII receptors and endothelial products derived from cyclooxygenase, (2) the response to AI is, in part, produced by its conversion into AII.", 
    "484": "We compared linearity, inotropic sensitivity (using dobutamine) and afterload dependency (using captopril) of contractile indices derived from the end-systolic pressure-volume relationship (ESPVR) and preload recruitable stroke work (PRSW) in man. We investigated 60 patients, 39 with normal (EF > or = 50%, group 1) and 21 with decreased ventricular function (EF < 50%, group 2). Variably loaded P-V loops were constructed by conductance catheters with vena caval occlusions. The slopes of the ESPVR (Emax) and PRSW (Mw) were assessed by linear regression analysis. The correlation coefficients of the ESPVR (r = 0.964) and PRSW (r = 0.976) were both very high, but the Z-value of the ESPVR was lower than for PRSW. During the control period, normalized Emax and Mw were significantly higher in group 1 than group 2 (Emax: 4.6 +/- 2.3 vs 2.8 +/- 0.8 mm Hg ml-1 m-2, Mw: 109 +/- 31 vs 86 +/- 28 10(3) dyn cm-2. After dobutamine, Emax and Mw increased significantly both in group 1 (128% and 124% vs control respectively) and in group 2 (132% and 130% respectively). After captopril, the ESPVR tended to shift to the right with a decrease in afterload; PRSW was unchanged. We conclude that PRSW may be a more linear and reliable index for evaluation of contractility in man.", 
    "485": "As a rule, left ventricular relaxation is impaired in patients with coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure. In addition, the passive elastic properties in early and late diastole change when the ventricle dilates. Diastolic properties of the left ventricle were studied in 11 patients with congestive heart failure class II-IV (NYHA) before and 3 months after 10-20 mg enalapril was added to their regimen of salt restriction, a diuretic and occasionally digitalis. Haemodynamic studies were performed using radionuclide angiography and simultaneous pressure-volume measurements. Systemic vascular resistance decreased from 1479 to 1182 dynes.s.-1 cm-5 (P < 0.05) and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure from 19.2 to 15.9 mmHg (P < 0.05). Left ventricular end-diastolic volume index decreased from 130 +/- 22 to 81 +/- 22 ml (P < 0.01). Indices of early diastolic relaxation, such as peak filling rate (1.43 +/- 0.46 to 1.49 +/- 0.84 EDV/s), time to peak filling rate (460 +/- 70 to 490 +/- 70 ms), peak negative dP/dt (-903 +/- 190 to -891 +/- 190 mmHg/s) and tau, the time constant of isovolumic pressure decay (58.7 +/- 14.4 to 48.4 +/- 15.2 ms) did not change significantly. In nine patients pressure-volume loops shifted to the left in all patients but one due to reduction in end-systolic and end-diastolic volume. The steepness of the diastolic part of the pressure-volume relationship increased, indicating an increase in chamber stiffness. The stiffness constant increased about 25% towards a more normal value. The alteration in stiffness seemed to be mainly due to the change of the geometry of the ventricle and not to a major change in the visco-elastic properties of the ventricular wall. In conclusion, regression of remodelling induced by enalapril does not change diastolic function parameters in patients with chronic congestive heart failure beyond the changes caused by regression of ventricular dilation.", 
    "486": "Lipophilicities of seven structurally diverse angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, viz., captopril, zofenoprilat, enalaprilat, ramiprilat, lisinopril, fosinoprilat, and ceronapril (SQ29852), were compared by determining their octanol-water distribution coefficients (D) under physiological pH conditions. The distribution co-efficients of zofenopril, enalapril, ramipril and fosinopril, which are the prodrug forms of zofenoprilat, enalaprilat, ramiprilat, and fosinoprilat, respectively, were also determined. Attempts were made to correlate lipophilicities with the reported data for oral absorption, protein binding, ACE inhibitory activity, propensity for biliary excretion, and penetration across the blood-brain barrier for these therapeutic entities. Better absorption of prodrugs compared to their respective active forms is in agreement with their greater lipophilicities. Captopril, lisinopril, and ceronapril are orally well absorbed despite their low lipophilicities, suggesting involvement of other factors such as a carrier-mediated transport process. Of all the compounds studied, the two most lipophilic ACE inhibitors, fosinoprilat and zofenoprilat, exhibit a rank-order correlation with respect to biliary excretion. This may explain the dual routes of elimination (renal and hepatic) observed with fosinoprilat in humans. The more lipophilic compounds also exhibit higher protein binding. Both the lipophilicity and a carrier-mediated process may be involved in penetration of some of these drugs into brain. For structurally similar compounds, in vitro ACE inhibitory activity increased with the increase in lipophilicity. However, no clear correlation between lipophilicity and ACE inhibitory activity emerged when different types of inhibitors are compared, possibly because their interactions with enzymes are primarily ionic in nature.", 
    "487": "The association between diurnal blood pressure variation and diabetic nephropathy was assessed in four groups of Type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetic patients who underwent 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring using an oscillometric technique. Patients with nephropathy, who had never been treated for hypertension (group D3, n = 13), were individually matched for age, sex and diabetes duration to a group of microalbuminuric patients (D2, n = 26), to normoalbuminuric patients (D1, n = 26) and to healthy control subjects (C, n = 26). Group D3 was also compared to patients with advanced nephropathy receiving treatment for hypertension, mainly a combination of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, metoprolol and diuretics (D4, n = 11). In group D3 24-h diastolic blood pressure (85 +/- 8 mm Hg) was comparable to the results obtained in D4 (85 +/- 8 mm Hg) but significantly higher than in D2 (78 +/- 7 mm Hg), D1 (73 +/- 7 mm Hg) and C (73 +/- 7 mm Hg, p < 0.05, Tukey's test). The night/day ratio of diastolic blood pressure was higher in D3 (86 +/- 5%) and D2 (85 +/- 7%) than in C (80 +/- 7%, p < 0.02). This ratio was also elevated in group D4 (94 +/- 8%) compared to D3 (p < 0.05) corresponding to a marked smoothing of the diurnal blood pressure curve. The 24-h heart rate (beats per min) was significantly elevated in D3 (84 +/- 8) and D2 (80 +/- 10) compared with C (73 +/- 11, p < 0.05 Tukey's test), suggesting the presence of parasympathetic neuropathy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "488": "1. Adult male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were given captopril plus hydrochlorothiazide mixed in the diet for 10 weeks. Calculated daily doses were 44 mg kg-1 per day for captopril, and 22 mg kg-1 per day for hydrochlorothiazide. Separate groups received captopril or hydrochlorothiazide alone, at similar doses, or no treatment. A final group of WKY normotensive rats received no drug. 2. Systolic arterial blood pressure, measured at regular intervals throughout the 10 weeks' period was lowered but not normalized, in groups receiving either captopril plus hydrochlorothiazide, or captopril alone, but not in the group receiving hydrochlorothiazide alone. 3. Following pentobarbitone anaesthesia, systolic arterial blood pressure, measured in the femoral artery, was found to be lower in all treated groups, but the greatest effect was observed in SHR previously treated with captopril plus hydrochlorothiazide. Aortic pulse wave velocity was also lower in treated SHR, and once again the greatest decrease was observed in the group previously treated with captopril plus hydrochlorothiazide. 4. Following pithing, systolic arterial blood pressures were similar in all SHR groups. Aortic pulse wave velocity was lower in pithed rats previously treated with captopril and hydrochlorothiazide. 5. In conclusion, antihypertensive treatment of SHR produces falls in blood pressure and pulse wave velocity, an indicator of aortic distensibility. Results in pithed rats suggest that treatment with the combination of captopril plus hydrochlorothiazide may increase aortic distensibility independently of blood pressure.", 
    "489": "A patient with a phaeochromocytoma and severe left ventricular heart failure caused by a catecholamine-induced cardiomyopathy is described. The clinical signs of congestive heart failure resolved rapidly on treatment with captopril and myocardial performance became normal within two weeks of medical treatment with captopril for one week and with captopril in combination with phenoxybenzamine for another week.", 
    "490": "To assess the feasibility of introducing captopril in patients with chronic heart failure on an outpatient rather than an inpatient basis a double-blind placebo-controlled study was carried out to compare either 6.25 mg or 25.0 mg of captopril as a starting dose; followed by either incremental doses of 6.25, 12.5, and 25.0 mg (low dose group), or 25.0 mg 8 hourly (high dose group) respectively. Forty-one patients in a general medical ward within a large teaching hospital with moderate to severe, stable, diuretic-controlled chronic heart failure, who were not hyponatraemic, hypokalaemic or on a dose of diuretic greater than 120 mg of frusemide took part. No patient experienced symptomatic hypotension. Both doses of captopril produced a significant drop in blood pressure (BP), the magnitude of which was similar in both groups. The first dose-induced fall correlated significantly with subsequent dose-related reductions in BP. Therefore if a patient did not have a hypotensive response to the first dose of captopril he/she would be unlikely to have one with subsequent doses. In the group as a whole, the magnitude of the fall in BP after the first dose correlated significantly with starting plasma levels of angiotensin II, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), aldosterone, and renin. However, on an individual basis, the two patients with the greatest fall in blood pressure did not have the most activated renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) system. This serves to emphasise the unpredictability of this response and the need to initiate therapy under clinical observation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "491": "The efficacy and tolerability of nicardipine retard and captopril were assessed in 174 over-60-year-olds suffering from slight or moderate essential hypertension. After 2-3 weeks of wash out the patients were randomly assigned to calcium antagonist (40 mg twice a day) or ace-inhibitor (25 mg twice a day) treatment which continued for 180 days. Monotherapy was combined with hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg/day) after 2 months in the event of an unsatisfactory reduction of arterial pressure in relation to basal values. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure was measured (1st and 5th Korotkoff's tone) at monthly intervals while lying and standing; heart rate was also measured using a palpatory method. Both nicardipine retard (no. 86) and captopril (no. 88) caused a significant reduction of clino- and orthostatic systolic and diastolic arterial pressure during the first two months of treatment. Respectively 70% and 51% of patients responded to treatment and the blood pressure reductions achieved using monotherapy remained unchanged during the course of the study. The association of hydrochlorothiazide resulted in a significant decrease in arterial pressure in non-responders, an effect which was observed with both nicardipine retard and captopril. No significant variation in heart rate was recorded between the two groups. Twenty-one patients in the nicardipine retard group and 16 in the captopril group suffered from slight to moderate side effects. Six patients dropped out of the nicardipine retard group and 15 patients out of the captopril group, an event for which side-effects were responsible in 1 and 3 cases respectively. In conclusion, nicardipine retard and captopril represent an efficacious form of treatment for geriatric hypertension and possess a satisfactory level of tolerability.", 
    "492": "Several authors have recently described the development of lithium toxicity after the addition of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors to a stable lithium regimen. This pilot study was designed to systematically investigate the effects of enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, on the serum level of lithium.", 
    "493": "In a 26-day outpatient study, nine healthy men took lithium for 10 days, lithium and enalapril for 10 days, and lithium alone again for 6 days. Serum lithium levels were measured while patients were taking lithium alone and while they were taking the lithium/enalapril combination.", 
    "494": "There were no statistically significant differences between mean serum lithium level during treatment with lithium alone and during treatment with the lithium/enalapril combination. However, one subject showed a 31% increase in serum lithium level after enalapril was added.", 
    "495": "Although no statistically significant differences between mean serum lithium level during treatment either with lithium alone or with lithium/enalapril were found, it is possible that the low dose of enalapril and low serum lithium levels employed for subject safety may have resulted in a type II statistical error. If enalapril doses or initial serum lithium levels were similar to those described in case reports, a significant difference in mean serum lithium levels may have been observed. While a predictable interaction between lithium and enalapril probably does not occur in all patients, factors such as enalapril dose, serum lithium level before addition of enalapril, or the presence of heart disease may make such an interaction more likely. At the levels of lithium and enalapril used in this study, elevated serum lithium concentration does not appear to be a universal event, but physicians must exercise appropriate caution.", 
    "496": "Orthotopic heart transplant recipients treated with immunosuppressive regimens based on cyclosporine have a high incidence of hypertension. Cyclosporine-induced nephrotoxicity characterized by afferent glomerular arteriolar vasoconstriction also develops in these patients. Calcium channel antagonists produce afferent glomerular arteriolar vasodilation. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) dilate the efferent arteriole and have been suggested to decrease glomerular filtration rate in subjects taking cyclosporine. To test the hypothesis that calcium channel antagonists would improve glomerular filtration rate in heart transplant patients receiving ACEI treatment, we reviewed the charts of our patients whose treatment for hypertension had been changed from an ACEI to a calcium channel antagonist. A change in renal function was assessed by the average of serum creatinine level, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine clearance within 3 months before and after the change from ACEI to calcium channel antagonist. Blood pressure was assessed on two different occasions before and after conversion to calcium channel antagonist. The data were analyzed by a paired Student t test. Serum blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels decreased significantly when patients were treated with calcium channel antagonists (p < 0.05). Creatinine clearance increased in all patients when the treatment was converted to a calcium channel antagonist (CCA) (ACEI = 56.4 +/- 19.3 ml/min versus CCA = 71.06 +/- 23.77, N = 9; p < 0.005). A 5-mm Hg decrease occurred in mean arterial pressure when treatment was changed from ACEI to calcium channel antagonists.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "497": "Abnormalities in sodium homeostasis and in atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) behavior could play a role in determining and accelerating the development of glomerular hypertension, hypertension, and microalbuminuria in insulin-dependent diabetes. The aim of the present study was to investigate in 32 hypertensive insulin-dependent diabetic patients (HD) with an altered albumin excretion rate the natriuretic response and ANP release to saline load (2 mmol/kg 90 min, and the effects angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor therapy 2.5 to 5.0 mg cilazapril, once daily), and calcium antagonists (sustained release verapamil: 120 to 240 mg Isoptin Press, once daily, and long acting nifedipine: 20 to 40 mg Adalat AR, twice daily) on sodium homeostasis and albumin excretion rate. Eight normal subjects matched for sex, age, and weight served as controls. The 32 HD patients showed a blunted response in ANP release and sodium excretion during saline infusion in comparison with controls. The cilazapril and verapamil treatments were tested in 16 of the 32 HD patients and were both effective in ameliorating natriuretic and ANP response to saline load and in decreasing albumin excretion rate. The combined cilazapril and verapamil treatment further improved both these parameters in these patients, although blood pressure levels were comparable. The other 16 HD patients underwent sequential verapamil and nifedipine treatment. Verapamil was more effective than nifedipine in improving natriuresis and ANP release to saline load and in lowering the albumin excretion rate. The results of the present study demonstrate that sodium homeostasis and ANP release are altered in hypertensive nephropathic patients, and both cilazapril and verapamil are more effective than nifedipine in ameliorating natriuresis, ANP release, and albumin excretion rate.", 
    "498": "The goal of this study was to evaluate the relative contribution of the renin-angiotensin system and mean arterial pressure to sodium excretion and urine flow rate during an infusion of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) at physiologically relevant doses in humans. Eight normal volunteers were studied during five periods: (1) baseline in the supine position; (2) during an infusion of ANP at physiologic doses (0.01 micrograms/kg/min) in the supine position; (3) during ANP infusion and 60 degrees head-up tilt; (4) during ANP infusion, head-up tilt, and interruption of the renin-angiotensin axis with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) enalaprilat; and (5) in the supine position during ANP infusion and ACEI. Infusion of ANP in the supine posture significantly increased urine flow rate and sodium excretion compared to baseline while mean arterial pressure and plasma renin activity were unchanged. During head-up tilt and ANP infusion, urine flow rate and sodium excretion were no longer significantly elevated over baseline while mean arterial pressure decreased and plasma angiotensin II levels increased. Addition of ACEI caused a marked diminution of urine flow rate and sodium excretion compared to baseline levels despite continued ANP infusion. Although mean arterial pressure after ACEI administration was lower than baseline, it was not significantly different from the non-ACEI head-up tilt state. Placing subjects in the supine position during ANP infusion and ACEI administration increased mean arterial pressure to levels that were no longer different from baseline, but urine flow rate and sodium excretion remained significantly depressed to the same degree as during head-up tilt with ACEI.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "499": "From July 18 through November 27, 1989, 12 anaphylactoid reactions (ARs) occurred in 10 patients at a hemodialysis center in Virginia. One patient required hospitalization; no patients died. ARs occurred within minutes of initiating dialysis and were characterized by peripheral numbness and tingling, laryngeal edema or angioedema, facial or generalized sensation of warmth, and/or nausea or vomiting. All 12 ARs occurred with dialyzers that had been reprocessed with an automated reprocessing system. A cohort study, including all patients undergoing dialysis sessions on the six days when an AR occurred, showed that the patients who experienced ARs were significantly more likely than patients who did not to be treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (7/10 vs. 3/33; relative risk = 7.9; 95% confidence interval = 2.5 to 25.2) and to have been exposed to reused dialyzers rather than to new dialyzers (12/70 sessions vs. 0/31; P = 0.016). In those sessions using a reused dialyzer, the mean number of dialyzer uses in case-sessions was significantly higher than for noncase-sessions (10.3 vs. 6.2; P = 0.016). After reuse of dialyzers was discontinued at the center, no further ARs occurred, despite the continued administration of ACE inhibitors. This is the first report of an outbreak of ARs associated exclusively with reused dialyzers. We hypothesize that interactions between a dialyzer that has been repeatedly reprocessed and reused, blood, and additional factors, such as ACE inhibitors, increased the risk of developing ARs.", 
    "500": "It is well known that isoproterenol (ISO) a nonselective beta adrenoceptor agonist induces cardiac hypertrophy. It can be assumed that, in addition to its direct cardiac effect, ISO has a cardiac trophic effect via stimulation of the renin angiotensin system. Synthesis of polyamines is facilitated in cardiac hypertrophy and polyamine levels are rapidly elevated prior to an increase in heart weight. In the present study, we investigated whether captopril (30 mg/kg body weight, daily) could attenuate cardiac hypertrophy and elevation of cardiac polyamine levels in rats, which effects were elicited by a chronic (1- or 2-weeks) and repeated administration of a small dose (0.5 mg/kg body weight) of ISO. Cardiac hypertrophy was assessed by an increase in the wet weight and RNA content of the heart. Polyamines were analyzed by HPLC. Captopril alone did not affect either heart weight/body weight ratio or cardiac contents of polyamines and nucleic acids at the end of the second week. In isoproterenol-treated rats, the above parameters, except for putrescine content on day 14, were significantly increased on both day 7 and day 14. Captopril slightly attenuated ISO-induced cardiac hypertrophy and significantly prevented the ISO-evoked increase in the contents of RNA, spermidine, and spermine at the end of the second week. These results suggest that the ISO-evoked increase in cardiac polyamines was mediated, at least in part, by the renin angiotensin system, which was stimulated by ISO.", 
    "501": "The disposition of [4S-[4 alpha,7 alpha,(R*),12b beta]]-7- [S-(1-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl)amino]-1,2,3,4,6,7,8,12b-octahydro-6- oxo- pyrido[2,1-a][2]benzazepine-4-carboxylic acid (MDL 27,088), a new a new angiotensin-covering enzyme inhibitor, was studied in cynomolgus monkeys and beagle dogs given intravenous (iv) doses of MDL 27,088 or its prodrug, MDL 27,210. Although in both species iv-administered MDL 27,210 was extensively (> 99.9%) metabolized and excreted in the urine and feces as MDL 27,088, the disposition of MDL 27,088 appeared to be significantly influenced by its mode of administration. For example, the mean terminal half-life of MDL 27,088 in plasma was longer when MDL 27,088 was given as its prodrug (3.65 and 2.23 h in monkeys and dogs, respectively) than when it was administered directly (0.84 and 1.05 h in monkeys and dogs, respectively). The renal excretion of MDL 27,088 also increased (from 33 to 73% of the dose in monkeys and from 9 to 17% of the dose in dogs) when MDL 27,088 was administered directly versus when it was given as its prodrug. These and other results of this study suggest that the disposition of MDL 27,088 can be significantly altered by iv administration of its prodrug form. Such changes in disposition also suggest that iv administration of prodrug may influence the pharmacological activity of MDL 27,088."
